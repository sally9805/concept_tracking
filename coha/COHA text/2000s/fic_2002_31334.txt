Chapter 1 : An Early Baby I was too young to remember her before she died , but my mother had a nanny , who , according to the way Mommy talks about her , was more of a mother to her than certainly her stepmother was . Sometimes I think how weird it is that Grandmother Grace , Mommy , and I have each had at least one stepparent in our lives . Are some people meant to be brought up that way ? I asked Mommy about that , and she said so many marriages end in divorces these days that it is not at all uncommon for a child to have stepparents . " People marry and remarry the way teenagers used to go steady and break up to go steady with someone else years ago , " she says . She 's very bitter about it , although she would be the last one to admit to that . Psychologists , both she and Miguel remind me , are not supposed to be judgmental . " We help our clients make those decisions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " she said . However , I have heard her angrily remark many times that the marriage vows should be updated . " They should be rewritten to say , ' Do you take this woman to have and to hold  --  for a while or until you get bored ? ' " Sometimes she is so down on male-female relationships that I have to wonder if I will ever find anyone with whom I might be happy and spend the rest of my life . According to what he has told me and how he acts , my stepfather , Miguel , has no doubts about it . He seems to be very happy and very determined to spend the rest of his life with Mommy . I have never said anything to her about it , but I think he loves her more than she loves him . I know he makes her happy . He makes her laugh a lot , and I can see she enjoys her conversations with him , especially when they are discussing social and psychological topics . But sometimes , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very distant . Her eyes take on a glazed look , and she stares at the sea or suddenly goes off to walk alone . She steals away when Miguel or I least expect it , walking through the house on " pussy willow feet . " I have watched her without her knowing , observed her on our beach , and have seen her moving slowly , as slowly as sand sifting through your fingers , idly watching time go by , her face sometimes taking on that dreamy far-off expression , her beautiful lips in a soft smile . It makes me think she hears voices no one else can hear , remembers a whisper , a touch , or even a kiss she has lost . Something wonderful slipped through her fingers years and years ago , perhaps , and now all she can do is resurrect the memory . " All our memories are like bubbles , Hannah , " she once told me . " They drift by and burst , and all you can do is wait for another chance to blow them through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch them , and they will pop and be gone . Sometimes I envy people who have suffered loss of memory and who are never tormented with their pasts . I even envy Linden , lost in some world of his own . " I hate it when she talks like that . It makes me think she would like to return to a time before I was born , as short as that happier period in her life might have been , and if she could , she would sell her soul to do so . How can she be unhappy here ? How could anyone ? We live on an estate called Joya del Mar . We have an enormous main house with halls so long and rooms so large , you could bounce your echo along the walls . The property is vast , too . On it we have a beach house , our own private beach front , a magnificent pool , beautiful patios and walkways with enough flowers and bushes to fill a small public park . She does n't have to do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a maid named Lila who has been with us nearly ten years . Twice a week a small army of grounds people manicure our property . Professionally , Mommy is very successful . She has a psychotherapy practice with an office in West Palm Beach , not far from the magnet school I attend . Magnet schools provide a more specialized curriculum . Mine emphasizes the arts , and since I like to sing , Mother arranged for me to attend the A. W. Drefoos School of Arts in West Palm Beach . We get up and go together most of the time , or my stepfather takes me . This was the year they were supposed to buy me my own car so I could drive myself places , but they have yet to do it . They have this idea that I should first find some sort of part-time job to at least pay for my own gas and insurance . " When you accumulate enough to pay for at least one year 's insurance , we 'll get you the car , " she has promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job that could fit into my schedule . I moaned and groaned , wondering aloud in front of them if my taking on a job would n't hurt my schoolwork . Miguel laughed . " Oh , having a vehicle and driving all over the place wo n't cut in on your study time ? " I hate having parents who are so realistic . The parents of other girls my age accept at least a fantasy or two . However , it is very important to Mommy and Miguel that I develop a sense of value , the one sense they both insist is absent in Palm Beach . " Here , people would think it justifiable to go to war over a jar of caviar , " Mommy once quipped . I do understand why she does n't like the Palm Beach social world . My maternal grandmother Grace was n't treated well here , and Mommy blames many of her own difficulties on that . At times Palm Beach does n't seem real to me , either . It 's too perfect . It glitters and feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge into West Palm Beach , Mother claims she is leaving the world of illusion and entering reality . " Rich people here are richer than rich people most everywhere else , " she told me . " Some of the wealthy people here are in fact wealthier than many small or third-world countries , Hannah . They keep reality outside their gold-plated walls . There are no cemeteries or hospitals in Palm Beach . Death and sickness have to stand outside the door . While the rest of us get stuck in traffic jams of all sorts in life , the wealthy residents of Palm Beach fly over them . " " What 's wrong with that ? " I asked her . " I 'd like that . " " They have n't the tolerance for the slightest inconveniences anymore . Sometimes it 's good to have a challenge , to be frustrated , to have to rise to an occasion , to find strength in yourself . You need some calluses on your soul , Hannah . You need to be stronger . " " But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the frustrations , why would it matter ? " I countered . She looked at me very sternly . " That 's your father talking , " she replied . Whenever she says that or says something like that , I feel as if she has just slapped me across the face . " You 'll see , " she added . " Someday you 'll see and you 'll understand . I hope . " Should I hope the same thing ? Why do we have to know about the ugly truths awaiting us ? I wondered that aloud when I was with my stepfather once , and he said , " Because you appreciate the beauty more . I think what your mother is trying to get you to understand is that not only do these people she speaks of have a lower threshold of tolerance for the unpleasant things in life , but they have or develop a lower threshold of appreciation for the truly beautiful things as well . The Taj Mahal becomes , well , just another item on the list of places to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean . " I did , but for some reason , I did n't want to be so quick to say I did . Whenever Mommy or Miguel were critical of the Palm Beach social world , I understood they were being critical of my father and his family as well , and even though they were n't treating me like a member of that family , I could n't help but think of them as part of me or me , part of them . I 'm full of so many emotional contradictions , twisted and tangled like a telephone wire with all sorts of cross-communication . It 's hard to explain to anyone who does n't live a similar life so I keep it all bottled up inside me . I never tell anyone in my classes at school or any of my friends about these family conflicts and feelings . Feelings , in fact , are often kept in little safes in our house . There is the sense that if we let too many of them out at the same time , we might explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too happy ; we 're never too sad . Whenever we approach either , there are techniques employed . After all , both Miguel and Mommy are experts in psychology . Daddy is always urging me to be different from them , warning me that if I 'm not , I 'll be unhappy . " Do n't be like your mother , " he says . " Do n't analyze every pin drop . Forget about the whys and wherefors and enjoy . She 's like a cook who ca n't go out to eat and take pleasure in something wonderful without first asking the waiter for a list of every ingredient and then questioning how it was prepared , always concluding with ' Oh , if he or she had done this or that , it would be even better . ' Do n't become like that , Hannah , " he advises . Maybe he 's right . But maybe , maybe I ca n't help it . After all , I am my mother 's daughter , too , are n't I ? Or is my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hoping for that little loss of memory she often wishes she had ? I have another fear , a deep , dark suspicion that I remind her so much of my father that she ca n't tolerate it anymore and that was and is the real reason why she finally wanted another child , a child with Miguel . Perhaps it is my imagination overworking or misinterpreting , but all throughout these last months of her pregnancy , I felt her growing more and more distant from me . She had less time to talk to me about my problems and concerns . Helping me find a suitable part-time job and getting me my own car seemed to have slipped out of both her and Miguel 's minds . She had more concern for her practice , finding ways to continue to treat or have her clients treated while she was recuperating from giving birth than she had for me . She wanted to stop going to work the last month , and she was always very busy trying to make arrangements . I could see that even our morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something or ask something and she did n't hear me because her ears were filled with her own worries and thoughts ? " What was that ? " she would ask , or she would simply not respond and I would give up , close up like a clam , and stare out the window wishing I had woken with a cold and stayed home bundled up and forgotten . However , my school , my teachers and some of the friends I had filled my life with more joy now . Staying home would have been punishing myself for no reason , or at least , no reason for which I could be blamed . In fact , some of my girlfriends actually felt sorry for me . They thought it would be weird if their mothers became pregnant like mine at this point in their family lives . " I can tell you right now what 's going to happen , " Massy Hewlett declared with the authority of a Supreme Court judge . " You 're going to end up being the family baby-sitter , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " " No , " I told her . " They have already decided to hire a nanny . My mother had one when she was little . She did n't need one when I was born because she was n't working yet , but she has to get back to her clients , so it 's different now . " " It 's not the same thing , " Massy insisted . " You 'll see . Older mothers are more neurotic . They have less tolerance , and they tend to exaggerate every little thing the baby does . A sneeze will become pneumonia . " " Do n't you think Hannah 's mother would be aware of all that ? " Stacy Kreskin piped up . " She just happens to be a psychologist , Massy . It 's not going to be the same for Hannah . " " We 'll see , " Massy said , refusing to be challenged or corrected . To Massy , being right was more important than being a good friend . It never even occurred to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have cared anyway . Reluctant to be defeated , she simply shifted to another level of criticism . " Even if she does n't find herself baby-sitting or being asked to hang around the house , she 'll feel like she does n't exist anymore . There 's a new king or queen . It happened to me ! " she cried , shaking her head at the looks of either skepticism or disapproval . " My baby sister is nearly eight years younger , so I should know , should n't I ? I 'm just trying to give her a heads-up about it . " Our little clump grew silent and then broke away like blocks that had lost their glue and exploded , sailing off in a variety of directions . I was left alone to ponder the way my world would change , feeling as if I was floundering on the border between childhood needs and adult responsibilities . Should I be whining about the way our lives were changing or should I accept and adjust ? Maybe I should n't care . Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . I wo n't be on everyone 's emotional radar screen . It 's good to be ignored , is n't it ? Or will I feel more unloved and unwanted than ever ? The conflict in me kept me so distracted , I felt like I was lost and drifting most of the time . Sometimes I felt I had stepped into the quagmire of emotions . I had to face it and find a way out . Now , with Mommy 's water breaking and little Claude on the threshold of our home and family , there was no more putting it off for later . Whether I liked it or not , whether I was ready or not , the whole situation was in my face . It was all happening and it could n't be ignored . There was going to be another child in this house , a little prince . The princess would have to step aside . On those rare occasions when either Mommy or Miguel were unable to drive me to school , our head grounds keeper , Ricardo , drove me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions were so rare , I could n't use them as an excuse or reason for them to get me my own car before I had a suitable job or earned the year 's worth of insurance . " What good is my driver 's license ? " I whined more than ever lately . " I do n't get much of an opportunity to use it . It 's not safe for someone to drive as little as I do . " " Now , there 's a good one , " Miguel teased . " In order to make the highways safer , we should increase the number of teenagers with their own cars . " " I 'm sure we 'll make it all happen soon , " Mommy promised . " As soon as I get free of these other issues , I 'll help you find suitable employment , and Miguel will look into what car we should get for you . Soon , " she repeated . Soon : That was an easy word to hate . Adults , especially parents , used it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of promise , but vague enough to keep them from having to make a real commitment . Even rarer were times when Mommy 's car was there for me to use . Right up to the last week of her pregnancy , she wanted her car at the house . It made her nervous not to have it available for an emergency . Ricardo could drive her anywhere if Miguel was n't home , or even I could . The morning Mommy 's water broke , Miguel asked me if I would rather go with them to the hospital and wait for my baby brother to be born , but I told him I could n't . I had an important English exam to take . I did n't , but I did n't want to be at the hospital . From simply listening to conversations Mommy and Miguel had about different clients of Mommy 's , I knew enough to describe myself as being in denial . I resented little Claude so much I refused to admit to his coming and being . I actually imagined Mommy returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been an incorrect diagnosis . It had turned out to be a digestive problem easily corrected . There was no little Claude after all . Our lives , mine in particular , would not change . My world would no longer be topsy-turvy . " Well , all right , " Miguel said with disappointment flooding his face . " I 'll tell you what , " he said . " Let Ricardo drive you this morning , and I 'll come to the school to get you if your mother gives birth before the day is over . I think that just might happen even though it 's nearly a month too soon , " he added with some trepidation in his voice . " You could call the school and let them know to tell me , and I 'll drive to the hospital , " I said . " Just in case she does n't give birth that quickly . " Once again his eyes darkened with disappointment . " Your mother is nervous , Hannah . I do n't want her worrying about you at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm a good driver . " He stared without replying . It was his way of pleading for understanding . " All right , " I said petulantly . Little Claude had n't made his first cry and already he was causing me unhappiness . I had to swallow it down . " Thank you , " Miguel said . After they had left and I had my breakfast , I got into Ricardo 's pickup truck . " Today you become a sister , " he declared with a joyful smile . " I bet you are excited , eh ? " " Yes , " I lied . I did n't like airing my inner feelings , especially ones that had me feeling guilty and ashamed . I hated myself for that , but I hated what had made me that way even more . Ricardo started to talk about his younger brothers and sisters . He was the oldest in a family of seven , but all of them had been born relatively close to each other . They all had much more in common than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was old enough to talk to me and understand anything significant , I would be in college . How could I ever think of him as a brother or ever care ? Ricardo 's voice droned on . Even with its musical cadence and his happy tones , it became a monotonous stream of noise behind me , behind my dark and dreary thoughts . " You can go a little faster , Ricardo , " I interrupted . " I do n't want to be late for school . " " Si , si , " he said . As we rode on , I glanced occasionally at pedestrians and the scenery , but I really saw no one or nothing , and when I arrived at school , I was surprised . Somehow , I did n't even realize the trip . I had been in too much of a daze . I hopped out quickly and barely uttered a thank-you and goodbye . Not one of my friends seemed to notice how unhappy I was . It caused me to wonder if to them I always appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my silence , my dark eyes , my downward gaze and lack of energy . They rambled on with their usual excitement , swirling around me , showing off new clothing , new makeup , different hairdos , and passing on stories and rumors about this boy and that . I almost felt as if I had woven a cocoon about myself and none of them could see , hear , or touch me . There was finally a reaction to and an awareness of my existence when Mrs. Margolis , the principal 's assistant and secretary , appeared at my classroom door and announced I was to be excused . " For a happy occasion , " she added , unable to contain the news . All my friends knew what that meant , and all turned to me , Massy 's face a scowl of pity . I quickly gathered my books and hurried out , head down , my heart feeling more like it was growling than beating . " Your stepfather is waiting for you in the lobby , " Mrs. Margolis said as we walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I muttered a thank-you and hurried along . Miguel stood smiling proudly near the front entrance . " I told you it would happen quickly . Little Claude has arrived , " he announced . " How 's Mommy ? " I asked . " She 's doing fine , but ... " he added letting the but hang for a while as we walked out and to his car . " But what ? " " Your little brother is smaller than we had expected him to be because he 's technically a premature baby even though he weighs enough . He 's doing fine , but to be on the safe side , the doctor would like to keep him there a little longer than they usually keep newborns . " " Oh , " I said , caught in a rainstorm of different feelings and thoughts . A part of me hoped he stayed there forever , but a larger part of me felt very sad for Mommy and for Miguel . " Naturally , your mother is concerned , so I thought it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell her how beautiful he is , " Miguel said . " I 'm sure you understand , " he added . I nodded , but I also always believed Mommy could tell if I was not sincere about something . Even my father believed she had a second set of eyes that slipped in front of her regular eyes and pierced through any mask of deception . " She ought to work for the CIA , " he quipped on more than one occasion . When we arrived at the hospital , we did as Miguel wanted and went to see little Claude first . He was in a bassinet that looked like it was built for a baby ten times his size . I could n't believe how small he was and that this tiny creature in that miniature form was a full human being related to me . His head looked no bigger than an apple , and his hands and feet were so doll-like , I could n't help doubting he was real . He was crying with such intensity , his face was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hours old , his skin around his tiny wrists and even under his eyes and his neck resembled skin wrinkled with age . I saw nothing beautiful about him and was actually happy about that . How could they make such a fuss over something like him ? " Is n't he remarkable ? " Miguel asked , standing beside me and looking through the window . " Yes , " I said . " But you 're right ... he 's so tiny . " " But he 'll grow fast . In a few weeks you wo n't believe you 're looking at the same child , " he assured me . " He has my hair , although not much of it yet , huh ? " " Dipped in ink , " I said , and Miguel laughed . When I was little , it was something he used to tell me about his hair and his beard . " Right , right . Well , let 's go see your mother , " he said , and I followed him to her room . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it only took one glimpse of her to know she was wading about in a pool of worry . " Did you see him ? " she asked almost before I stepped through the door . " Yes . He 's so tiny , but he has Miguel 's hair , " I said quickly . Miguel laughed , but Mommy held her expression of deep concern . " I did everything I was supposed to do . I ate right . I do n't smoke , and I did n't even have a glass of wine for nearly nine months . Those vitamins , " she told Miguel , " we should have them analyzed . Vitamins and health foods are not inspected and analyzed by the government . Maybe they were n't what they were advertised to be . " " It 's not the vitamins , " Miguel said softly , closing and opening his eyes . " It makes no sense to flail about searching for some demon , Willow . You gave birth and that 's it . He 'll be fine . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with the face I knew my real father hated , the face that made a liar , a dreamer , a procrastinator swallow back his or her words . Miguel called her " lie-proof . " " Fibs and exaggerations bounce off and come back at the people who send them in her direction , " Miguel told me often , leading me to think he was trying to warn me never to attempt to deceive her . He raised his arms . " What ? " he cried . " They do n't keep a baby as long as he wants to keep Claude under observation , Miguel . Too early is too early . Please . You 're not talking to an idiot . " " All right , all right . Still , it will be fine . You will see . " " I hope so , " she said and turned to me and finally smiled . " He is beautiful , though , is n't he , Hannah ? " " Uh-huh , " I said even though my idea of a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You finally have a little brother . When I was growing up , I longed so for a sister or a brother . Most of my friends had one or the other , and even though they were always teasing or arguing with each other , I knew they at least had someone , had family . I 'm sorry we waited so long to give you a sibling , honey . But you will be older and wiser and almost a second mother to him . " " When he 's my age , I 'll be thirty-four , " I said . " I 'll probably have my own children by then . " " Yes , " she said . " But he will love having nieces and nephews , too . You 'll see . If I 've learned anything from marrying Miguel , it 's how important and wonderful family can be . You 'll see , " she promised . " I was thinking I would run back to the college and attend that faculty union meeting . It 's important , " Miguel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " " It 's fine , Miguel . Hannah can stay a while with me . " " You 're not tired ? " " I 'll doze on and off , I imagine , but I would n't mind the company , if you would n't mind staying a while , Hannah . " " No , I want to stay , " I said quickly . " Fine , then , " Miguel said . He walked to the door , turned , and raised his shoulders and puffed out his proud father 's chest . " I 'll be back , " he added , pretending to be Arnold Schwarzenegger . Both Mother and I laughed at his poor imitation , and then he left . " Are you going to have Miguel bring Uncle Linden here to see him ? " I asked her . " No . I think it would be better if we just waited until we bring Claude home . Then we 'll either have Linden over or take the baby there . " " Why ? He can come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We take him to restaurants , do n't we ? Why ca n't we bring him to a maternity ward ? " She scrunched her nose like she had just sipped some sour milk . " I do n't think it 's a good idea to bring him to hospitals of any kind , Hannah . He does n't feel good about that . Too many unhappy and unpleasant memories from his time in clinics and such . Why do that to him ? " she asked . " We leave him out of too many things , " I complained . She smiled . " He 's not being left out . " " Yes , he is , " I insisted . " No one stands up for Linden like you do , Hannah . That 's very nice . " " He does n't have anyone but us , " I said . " He 's not related to Miguel and you 're very busy . He 's always saying you do n't visit him as much as you used to visit him . " She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , he does , " I insisted . " All right , honey , all right . Do n't get yourself so upset about it . We wo n't leave Uncle Linden out of anything . I promise . " " I do n't know why he 's still in that place . He paints beautiful things . People buy them ! He does n't bother anyone . Why do n't we just have him come home and live with us ? Our house is certainly big enough , even with a new baby . We have rooms that have been shut up for as long as I can remember . " " He does well where he is , Hannah . Everything is organized for him , and he does n't have to be reminded of bad memories , memories that made him sick . " " You have said that often before , Mommy , but I still do n't understand what that means . What bad memories ? What 's in our house that would remind him of them anyway ? " She closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow . The nurse came in to check her blood pressure and see how she was doing . Mommy introduced me to her , and I could see by the expression on her face that she was surprised my mother had a child as old as I was . Anyone looking at the two of us could see that I was really her daughter , too . She had n't married Miguel and inherited me . We had the same nose and mouth . My eyes were my father 's blue , but my hair was Mommy 's light brunette shade . I had a slightly darker complexion . I was about an inch or so taller than she was , and I had a fuller figure . Some of my girlfriends were jealous of that , but I always wished I was more diminutive even though they thought I would be more attractive to most boys . I 've had boyfriends on and off since the ninth grade , but no one I would drool over or suffer heartbreak over when we went our separate ways , no one until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a new student in our school and very much a loner . Massy said he was weird and blamed it on his having a mother whose family came from Haiti and a father who was white and from New Orleans . His father was a musician with a jazz band and traveled a great deal . He had a fourteen-year-old sister , Elisha , who attended a regular public school , but being he was a talented songwriter and guitar player , Heyden came to our magnet school when he moved to West Palm Beach . He came every day on an old moped that other students teased him about , but he did n't seem to care . I had spoken to him only a few times , but I sang with him once in vocal class , and the way he looked at me afterward made me tingle inside . I thought he was handsome with his caramel complexion and his dark , curly hair , strong mouth , and black pearl eyes . He was lean and tall like Miguel . I did n't find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious and a lot more interesting than the other boys in the school . As soon as the nurse left Mommy 's room , Mommy turned back to me . I did n't think she was going to say anything more about Uncle Linden . She never liked to talk about him all that much , especially with me , but she surprised me . " Your uncle Linden has a hate-love relationship with Joya del Mar , Hannah . When you were little , we brought him around often , but he literally trembled as we drove through the gates each and every time . " " Why ? " I asked , intrigued . She had never told me anything like this . " You know he and my mother used to live in the beach house after my mother 's stepfather practically bankrupted my grandmother Jackie Lee . It was difficult and sad for Linden to be forced to move out of his home and live in an apartment under the help 's quarters . It made him bitter and he resented the Eatons . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the debts . You fixed everything , " I said . She started to smile and stopped . " Fixed , " she said as if it pained her tongue . " Hardly that , Hannah . It was true that thanks to my father , I had inherited enough money and property to bail out my mother and Linden from their debts and make it possible for all of us to return to the main house , but I was also a foolish , impressionable young girl who allowed your father to charm and beguile me with his elegance and his promises . Even with your uncle Linden 's mental turmoil and difficulties , he was wiser about your father than I was . I should have listened to him . " " If he was so wise and you were becoming a psychologist , why did he end up in a mental clinic ? " She took a deep breath . Was I being selfish by making her talk when she was tired and weak from giving birth ? I could n't help it . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , a room I had wanted to peer inside all my life . " You know that his father , Kirby Scott , seduced and performed what amounted to rape of mine and Linden 's mother . Linden had a very difficult and confused upbringing . For a while he was given to believe my grandmother was actually his mother . It was an attempt to sweep the disgrace under a rug . When he learned the truth about himself , it triggered his manic-depressive condition . He lived on the darkest edges of the world he envisioned . Right from the beginning Mother and he were not treated nicely by the people here . They made him feel freakish , and because of that , he became even more introverted . " It became very serious after our mother died . He wanted to shut us both up and shut out the world outside our gates . He had something of a nervous breakdown over it , in fact . So you can see why our home is not the happiest of places for him to be , Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his art . The work he is doing at the residency is brighter , happier than the work he did here . Right ? " I nodded . " I wish , then , that we could sell Joya del Mar and find another place , one where he would be happier . " " I do n't know if that would solve all his problems , honey , " she said . I sensed that there was more to see and know in this dark shut-up room , but she did n't look like she was going to tell it all to me . " When I get married and move away , I 'll make sure I have a home big enough for him , too , " I vowed . " Maybe you will , " Mommy said smiling . She closed her eyes again . " Claude is beautiful , " she muttered , " is n't he , Hannah ? I hope and pray he 'll be all right . You pray , too , sweetheart , pray for your little brother . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her breathing became soft and regular . For a few moments I sat there , pouting , and then I rose and went back to the nursery to look through the window at my new brother , at the little being who could bring so much joy to my mother and Miguel simply by appearing . Looking at Claude caused me to wonder about Uncle Linden , born secretly in that beach house , barely knowing his mother before she was sent to my grandfather 's clinic . Do babies sense the separation , long for their mothers without even realizing what it is that makes them feel so lost ? Was Uncle Linden terrified at night when he cried and was comforted not by his mother , but by his grandmother ? Something made little Claude shudder , and then a moment later he waved his arms and small fists wildly , screaming . No one seemed to notice . I looked about frantically until finally I saw a nurse go to him . She held him for a moment , but that did n't stop his crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do something before he chokes to death on his own tears . I was about to pound on the glass and shout it , but the nurse smiled as if there was absolutely nothing wrong , then she said something to another nurse and took him out . I worried about where she had taken him until I saw she was bringing him to Mommy 's room . " What 's wrong with him ? " I asked . " Nothing . He 's just hungry , " the nurse replied and went in to wake Mommy so she could breast-feed him . She had decided she would do that . Nothing brought home little Claude 's favored place and status in our family more than watching him suckle at Mommy 's breast and seeing the angelic joy in her face . Mommy never told me whether or not she had breast-fed me , and suddenly it became very important to know . " He 's so hungry , " Mommy said . " That 's good . " " Was I breast-fed , too ? " I asked abruptly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , actually , you were n't . I was so crazed back then . Your father and I had separated . I was feeling so abused . Despite what everyone was telling me , I could n't help believing I had permitted him to ruin my life . " " Then you did n't want me to be born ? " " Yes , of course I did . I was just feeling terribly sorry for myself . My mother had died ; Linden was not doing very well , as I explained to you , and here I was , pregnant with a husband who considered adultery less important than a parking ticket . " But the moment you appeared on the scene , it all changed . It was as if the sun had finally come out on a rainy day . " " Then why did n't you breast-feed me , too ? " She hesitated , glanced at Claude , and then looked at me and forced a smile . Mommy 's forced smiles always looked like she could go either way : cry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in somewhat of a state of turmoil . I had no one but Miguel really . I needed to get back on my feet as quickly as I could . I tried to stay home with you as long as I could , but eventually , I had to get out in the world and occupy myself . You had a wonderful nanny in Donna Castilla , and Mrs. Davis , bless her soul , watched over you as though you were her very own grandchild . In the beginning I had my hands full arbitrating the arguments between the two of them concerning what was best for you and what was not . Do you remember any of that ? " " A little , " I said . " Yes , well , I 'm glad I did n't keep a nanny as long as my stepmother did , even though Amou was more my mother . You , thank goodness , had me and had a stepfather who has always loved you like his own . " " Now he has two children to love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered if she could hear my fears in my voice . I really meant he 'll love him more . It 's only natural , I thought . Claude is his real child and Claude is his son . " Does that hurt ? " I asked . " Breast-feeding ? Just the opposite . However , you wo n't find many Palm Beach mothers doing it . They 're terrified of losing their figures . " " Are n't you ? " " No , " she said firmly . " Besides , I want to do what 's best for him , " she added . Then why did n't you do what was best for me ? I wanted to ask , but I did n't . I watched for a while , and then , after the nurse returned and took Claude back to the nursery , I went to get Mommy some magazines at the hospital gift shop . When I returned to the room , Miguel was there . He was ranting on and on about his faculty meeting , and Mommy was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her face . " I mean , they will , they wo n't . Talk , talk , talk , but no action ! " he exclaimed . " They 're afraid , Miguel . They have to talk themselves into it first . It takes time . " " Time is not something they have in abundance here , Willow . Oh , what 's the use ! " he cried and collapsed in the chair , his arms dangling . The he looked up at me and shook his head . " Do n't marry a schoolteacher unless he 's independently wealthy , " he told me . " I 'm not getting married , " I retorted . " What ? Why not ? " " I want to have a career . " " Your mother has a career and she 's married , " he said , nodding at Mommy . " She 's different , " I said . " She can be a psychologist and stay in one place . I will have to travel , do tours , be in shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for a child . " " Sure you will , " Miguel said . " No , I wo n't . I especially wo n't be able to breast-feed , " I practically screamed . The smile lifted off his face . He looked at Mommy . " It 's all right , Hannah . You 're too young to have to worry about those things anyway , " she said . " What did you get me ? " she asked , and I brought her the magazines . " Good , " she said , looking them over . " You guys better go home , " she told Miguel . " Sure , " he said , standing . " I 'll be back after dinner . " He leaned over and kissed her softly on the mouth . " Thank you for my son , " he whispered loud enough for me to hear . She beamed . I turned toward the door . " Hannah ? " she called , holding up her arms . I went to her and let her embrace and kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stuck in a firm pout . " Take care of Miguel , " she said . " Make sure he eats a real dinner and does n't stop at some taco stand and call that a meal , " she added , eyeing him with pretended fury . He laughed . " She reads my mind , that woman . No wonder she is such a successful psychotherapist . " If she could only read mine , I thought , she would know how deep the hurt I felt was and how it seemed to travel through my body , even affecting the way I walked . Miguel insisted on stopping by the nursery on our way out . " One more look to be sure it 's all real , " he said . Little Claude was contentedly asleep , his tummy full of Mommy 's milk . There was no umbilical cord between them , but he was still dependent on her . He was n't a day old , and he was already more a part of this family than I had ever been , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
