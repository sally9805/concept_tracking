Luz Cuevas was told that her baby had died in a fire . Then she saw her at a birthday party-five years later . The story of their joyous reunion // Luzaida Cuevas was nervous as she prepared to meet her young daughter for only the second time in six years . When Cuevas arrived at the government office in southern New Jersey , where the March 4 reunion was to take place , 6-year-old Aaliyah was hiding under a table . But the little girl quickly sprang out-her arms opened wide for a hug-and yelled " Surprise ! " " She kissed me and said , " You 're my mommy , ' ' " recalls Cuevas , 31 . " I held her like a baby . Could you imagine ? It was incredible . " All the more so because little Aaliyah-or Delimar as she was once known - was long assumed dead . The tale of how mother and daughter were separated and finally reunited is the stuff of a Hollywood screenplay . It began on Dec. 14 , 1997 , when a woman named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then-boyfriend Pedro Vera . A distant cousin of Vera 's , Correa , now 42 , said she had come to see if he could fix the brakes on her car . Cuevas had never seen Correa before . But the next day she visited again , this time to see if Vera could help her find a job at the cable company where a friend of his worked . Vera and Correa went out , and Correa came back alone . Recalls Cuevas : " We talked for a while , and I went upstairs with the baby . " She placed Delimar , just 10 days old , in her crib and was on her way back downstairs when an explosion suddenly ripped through the top floor of the wood-and-brick row house . Cuevas ran back up the stairs to the baby 's room but found only an empty crib and-despite the cold weather-an open window . " I looked in the crib , in the bed . Then I ran out , screaming that the baby was n't there . The smoke was already thick , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls . Meanwhile , alerted by relatives , Vera , Delimar 's father , returned home to see the house in flames . " I went crazy , " he says . " I wanted to see if anyone was inside , and they did n't let me . One of the firemen came out and hugged me and said he was sorry but that my daughter was dead . " Correa , meanwhile , had vanished . Hospitalized for facial burns and smoke inhalation , Cuevas , a Puerto Rico native who speaks little English , was incredulous . Fire officials could not produce the body , and a death certificate was never issued . Yet the baby had been incinerated in the fire , according to the medical examiner and the fire department , which also determined that the fire was probably caused by a faulty extension cord connected to a space heater . Cuevas 's intuition told her otherwise . " I suspected Carol from the beginning , " she says . " But I did n't know what she had done with the baby . " Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had no personal experience with the law and was convinced that no one would take her hunch seriously . Yet her suspicions only intensified in the months and years to come . Although Correa and Cuevas barely knew one another , they were loosely connected by a large group of family and friends . And sure enough , just four months after the fire , Vera 's sister Evelyn saw Correa and a baby in her neighborhood and told her brother she was struck by how much lighter the baby 's skin was than Correa 's . Then , at a baby shower for his niece in 2001 , Vera says he saw Correa and the girl . " As I was arriving , Carol was getting in her car with the baby in the backseat , " says Vera , 39 ( who split with Cuevas later that year ) . " I knocked on the window . She said , " Hi , " and she gave me a kiss . When they left , the little girl turned around and smiled at me . It was chills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later he saw the child again at a birthday party . Correa appeared nervous and moved the child away from him . He called Cuevas and said , " Luz , I was at this party , and the girl looks like me and you . " Ever hopeful that her daughter would be found , Cuevas , who had refused to hold a funeral service for the baby , had gone on about her life , raising her three sons , now 11 , 10 and 4 . Then in January 2003 , she ran into Correa for the first time since the day of the fire , at a birthday party for another relative . With her was a dark-haired , bright-eyed 5-year-old girl . " She smiled at me , and it was her , " says Cuevas . " She had the same dimples she had when she was a baby . " Still , she knew she needed proof . " I waited until she was on the floor , playing with another child , and I just said , " Oh , look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " she says . " I went over and took some of the hair and put it in a napkin . I wanted to talk to her , to tell her everything , but I was afraid Carol would see . I was just so happy to see her . You ca n't imagine how happy I was to know she was alive . " Although Cuevas knew the strands of hair could provide the DNA she needed , " I did n't know what I was supposed to do with it , " she says . " I was trying to figure out where I should go , how much it would cost to have it tested . " Finally , on Jan. 24 , she found someone who could help : Angel Cruz , a Pennsylvania state representative and the state 's only Latino legislator , who listened , stunned but intrigued . " The way she reacted and how perfectly sure she was made me a believer , " he says . He convinced Philadelphia assistant district attorney Angel Flores to listen to her too . Skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying , " I know in my heart my baby is alive , ' ' " he says . " She begged me to help , and I put down what I was doing and started making calls . " The Philadelphia police 's Special Victims Unit took over the case and immediately raised questions about the absence of a body . Although the Philadelphia Fire Department has not commented , Dr. Michael Baden , the chief forensic pathologist for the New York State Police , who was not involved in the case , says there 's no question that the official report was wrong . " When house fires really get going , they only get up to 1,600 Fahrenheit , " says Baden . " The body is a marvelous machine , and it does n't disappear readily . Babies do n't get consumed in fires . " The Philadelphia SVU reached the same conclusion . " The mother , " says Flores , " had a viable , accurate theory . " Cuevas 's theory led police directly to Correa . Yet why Correa would steal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , she had told friends that she was pregnant around the time of the fire , something investigators have not confirmed . A pharmacy and grocery worker , she had raised few if any suspicions among her neighbors in Willingboro , N.J. , where Aaliyah attended a Catholic school and had begun pursuing a modeling career , appearing in ads for Target and Hasbro . " They were very close , " says Kathy Donahue , whose Cherry Hill , N.J. , modeling agency represented Aaliyah . " They were a great mommy and daughter . " When police approached her , Correa gave them a photo of a different child and a false birth certificate . They returned with a court order to test Aaliyah 's DNA . Even then , as SVU investigators prepared to take a swab from the inside of Aaliyah 's cheek , " the child revealed that Mommy had sprayed something in her mouth and told her not to swallow or tell anyone , " says Leslie Gomez , another assistant district attorney who worked on the case . " We assume it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , it did n't work . The test proved once and for all that the child was indeed the little girl that Cuevas had lost . On March 3 , Correa was arraigned on charges including kidnapping , arson and criminal conspiracy , for which she may face life in prison . Meanwhile , Philadelphia officials have launched a probe into the initial fire investigation . As for little Aaliyah , two days after Correa 's arraignment , social workers brought her to visit Cuevas at the home she 'll share with her and her brothers . " She walked in and said , Tm the princess , ' " says Cuevas . " Her brothers picked her up , and then , even the little one , they were all giving her kisses . " Although Aaliyah was all grins as she examined her room , telling her mother that she wanted Barbie decor , psychologists warn that the transition could be tough ( see box ) . Further complicating matters , Vera is suing Cuevas in Philadelphia family court for joint custody of the child , which Cuevas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the child . She has no illusions that the coming months are going to be easy , but for now both mother and daughter ca n't help smiling . " Obviously it is going to be work for her to adapt , " Cuevas says . " But right now she 's happy . " Sidebar " She kissed me and said , " You 're my mommy . " I held her like a baby . . . . It was incredible " On March 8 , a joyous Luz Cuevas welcomed her daughter Aaliyah at her home in North Philadelphia . " I imagined a lot of things about her in the last six years , " Cuevas says of Aaliyah ( as a newborn named Delimar ) . " Now I can say she is my daughter " Sidebar She smiled at me , and it was her .
