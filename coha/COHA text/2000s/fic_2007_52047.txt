SWORE I 'D NEVER GO INTO space again , not after the last time , not after the bloody events on Planet Bela . I 'd not only promised myself , I 'd promised my wife - a much more serious matter . Yet there I was , listening to the hiss of an airlock . In the words of an ancient philosopher , it was dj vu all over again . I tried to comfort myself ( as I 'd tried to comfort her ) with the thought that a mere orbital station is n't really space . Terra , big and blue and cloud-wreathed , hovered a mere 36,000 and some odd clicks below . And somewhere down there , in the Great American Desert , lay Manypalms Oasis with its new faux-adobe dwellings , its lush parks where retirees practiced tai chi amid flaming clumps of bougainvillea . Beyond it , a sun-shocked moonscape with hills of bare rock named for the animals they 're supposed to resemble - the Mountain Lion , the Dromedary . In my mind 's eye I could see Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd already lived too long live longer yet . I should have been at the Wellness Center nearby , conducting a martial arts class I started to help the oldsters keep spry . Ever seen ninety-year-olds smashing bricks with their hands ? Makes them feel like they 're seventy-five again . Well , I would n't be holding class for a while . I checked my new pocket omni , set it to record everything I heard , and buried it in a coded memory - including my own stream of consciousness , picked up from a chip embedded in my larynx . Then the seal on the airlock 's inner door opened with a sigh of compressed air , a chunky hooded figure stepped forward to receive me , and I entered - for the first time ever - a lamasery of the White Monks . Nothing of the spook 's face was visible except a bristly bearded mouth that growled , " Welcome to Heaven 's Footstool . Please step through the scanner . " Not at all the smooth , unctuous , clerical sort of voice I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was no big surprise . Sure , India and China dominate everything today , but that means they 're at loggerheads all the time . So here we are still chattering in English , everybody 's second language , which is easier to learn anyway and politically okay because England and America do n't amount to much any longer , so nobody feels intimidated by them . Indo-Chinese rivalry is also why the world capital 's at New Angkor , sort of midway between the Dragon and the Elephant . This trivia was drifting through my head ( and recording itself in the omni ) , while I stood gawking at the ancient space station . Impatiently , the monk cleared his throat . " I took my first trip to Luna from here , " I explained . " Almost fifty years ago . In those days it was OS-1 . Busy place , with people going into space and coming back , scientists doing astronomy , cosmology , weightless studies - " " It 's different now , " he snapped . " The scanner , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't allow " em here . Be sure your stickums are tightly laced . Pseudograv generator 's practically dead , and you would n't want to bounce off the ceiling , eh ? Now , look in the little mirror . " He pressed a small oblong white box against my face . I hardly had time to flinch before the expected flash of intense light . While crimson dots spun across my field of vision , the monk read my name , rank , and serial number from the display . " Kohn , " he muttered . " Robert Rogers . SN 52.452.928 . Colonel , Security Forces , Ret . Why 'd they haul you out of retirement ? " " Could n't do without me , " I lied . Actually , HQ did n't want to waste a senior officer - which was what the monks were demanding - on what the cops called " the murder of some piss-ant little spook . " I 'd gained a kind of ambiguous fame handling offworld homicides during the BeIa episode , which - in addition to bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us our lives also cost me a chunk of my hard-earned pension . So , speaking religiously , all things worked together for good : HQ offered to reinstate my full pension if I would get the monks - who wield a lot of clout politically and ca n't be ignored - off their backs . They even supplied me a ride on an official cruiser , instead of making me wait two days and take the regular supply shuttle . But no need for this spook , who introduced himself as Brother Ion , to know all that background . While he was busy stowing his retinagraph in one of his capacious sleeves , I hit him with a line I 've always wanted to use . " Take me to your Master , " I deadpanned . " Master Po 's a hundred and twenty-eight , " he answered , apparently seeing nothing funny in my wit . " I spend a lot of my time watching over the old guy . The CM runs day-to-day operations . " " CM ? " " Chief Monk . The Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . He pulled an omni out of the same sleeve - must 've had pockets inside , like a kimono - and grunted into it , " Got him . " Then held the gadget in front of my face so the boss could see me . " Like the pseudograv , " he explained , " the whole damn monitoring system " - he gestured at an antique security camera on one wall - " is down , so we have to use omnis . Let 's go . " We set off at almost a run . I gathered without being told that the CM was an impatient man . You get used to Standard Gravity - Earth standard , I mean . Among other things it gives you hemorrhoids , heart trouble , big muscles and the habit of using them . I was wearing Velcro-soled boots ( " stickums " ) that cling to the gray carpeting , but the rest of me bounced up at every step , because I was pushing down too hard . For every action there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start doing my job , storing away faces and IDs in what was still a trained and ample memory . " Could you dispense with the hood for a second ? " I asked Brother Ion . " I like to see who I 'm talking to . " " No can do . Regulation Nineteen , " In public , monks will cover their heads at all times except when eating or performing ablutions . " By the way , I 'm not supposed to be talking , either . Regulation Four : " Except in dire emergencies , all monks will observe the rule of silence from the beginning of Morning Meditation to the close of Great Meditation in the evening . " " " Is n't murder a dire emergency ? " " For the corpse , yeah . Not for me . " Abruptly he halted at an unmarked door and struck it once with his knuckles . A growl from within , and Ion threw it open . " His Reverence , honored Chief Monk Aung Chai , " he intoned , in a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least , " said a bass voice , " those clowns on Terra sent me a senior officer . Very senior . Call the doctor and make Brother Kendo ready to receive guests , " he added to Ion , who vanished , the door whispering shut behind him . " Ion 's my seneschal , " the CM explained . " Closest thing we have to a cop here . Bit of a thug , I believe , before he got religion . Brother Kendo is the victim . " He leaned over a broad red-lacquered Ming-dynasty table he used for a desk and waved one hand . I sat on a gilded chair facing him . Like all furniture there , it was clamped to the floor , and like all chairs it had a seatbelt that I cinched around my hara , or midriff , to keep myself from drifting . The Chief Monk had his hood pushed back - apparently neither Regulation 19 nor Regulation 4 applied to him - and his face not only grabbed but held my attention . Whatever I expected a Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my list . I used to hunt them in the Northern Mountains before I gave up killing except in self defense , and their resemblance to the CM is startling . A long broad nose , a five-day growth of ginger whiskers , long sharp teeth , and a pair of dark mesmerizing eyes that did n't appear to blink . Only the round pupils stopped me from thinking that some nutcase scientist had made a chimera while playing with the genes of two species . Yet I also felt an uneasy sense of kinship . He was about my size and we could 've sung a bass duet if anybody ever wrote such a thing . He was clearly of European descent , his English accented from someplace near the North Sea . Adopted his name , I supposed , with a bow to Asia from which the White Monks derive their faith . A small serving bot with one off wheel wobbled up , asking politely if I wished tea . Very much , said I , and it scooted off about its housewifely duties . The CM sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other resting upright on its elbow . He was checking me out , just as I was contemplating him . He fit well into his setting - the Ming desk , the elegantly loomed carpet glued to the deck , the walls hung with antique scrolls . Sung landscapes with beetling cliffs , fathomless valleys , drifting clouds , rushing streams . Souvenirs of the Earth , where people were meant to live . Why was he here ? Why was I ? " A guest did it , " he said abruptly . " Pardon ? " " People come up here , lay people . To make a retreat , escape the mindless distractions of worldly life . Recharge their spiritual power packs , so to speak . In addition to our eighty-seven monks , we have at present thirty-three guests . One of them stabbed Brother Kendo . Why , I ca n't imagine . " The Chief Monk was either genuinely baffled or a very good liar . " He was so unimportant , " he said . " What are your guests like ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rich and powerful need religion , too . But right now we have one who does n't fit just does n't fit . Do n't know what he 's doing here . A gladiator , rich but crude , very crude . " A gladiator . Hmm . I used to watch the Absolute Combat shows on telly before Anna made me stop . The eternal appeal of real blood intermittently of real death . I was beginning to understand why the CM called on Earth security for help . The monks " excellent political connections are , of course , legendary . The Council of State in New Angkor not only gave them this elderly space station free of charge , it made the station legally a sovereign world , even though it depended on Terra for everything from food to , well , detectives . Hence unbelievers " sardonic term for it : the Flying Vatican . And here , like the bravos in old Roma who served the more murderous impulses of the Renaissance Popes , lived a guest whose profession was death . I figured I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How and when did Brother Kendo die ? " The Chief Monk frowned , rather a fearsome event considering the size and shape of his face . " That question will be answered fully later on . First , however , I 've got some things to show you . " When I started to object , he held up a big , dead-white palm . " I have my reasons . You 've been seconded to the government here , and I am the government . Under , of course , Master Po . Like it or not , you 'll do things my way . And now I imagine the corpse has been removed from the refrigerator and prepared for your inspection . So let 's go . " He sprang up with the speed only weightlessness makes possible . The bot reappeared with steaming cups of tea and , robotically , started serving even though we were headed out . I could hear its off wheel squeaking as the door whispered shut behind me . The CM had maybe thirty years on me and moved at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , stickums clutching the deck at every step and protesting as I pulled them free . As we strode along , the structure of the station started coming back to me . Basically it was four concentric wagon wheels connected by nine spokes . Set at the center was a hub ( creatively named the Hub ) , which contained the central control room , mainframe computer and machinery for heating , cooling , water processing and recovery , and so on . Heaven 's Footstool had n't kept its orbit for over two hundred years on sheer inertia ; attitude and altitude were constantly being adjusted by plasma jets fired through a couple of hundred vents on the outer hull . The lingo of the place was maritime , I remembered : the floor was always the deck , a wall a bulkhead , the ceiling was I did n't recall what . This was D Ring , the outermost . We turned from it into Spoke 9 and hastened past C and B Rings to A. Here the CM thrust like a battering ram through double doors into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk-in refrigerator . " We lack a morgue , " he said by way of explanation . Brother Ion and another , shorter monk were waiting beside the stiff and frosty body of a thick-set fiftyish man lying facedown on a stainless-steel table . A blue sheet covered him to the waist ; a strap kept sheet and man from drifting . His upper torso was bare , and just under the left scapula a red circle drawn with a grease pencil highlighted an almost invisible two-centimeter-wide knife wound . For a few seconds we stood there , three monks and a detective viewing the one reality that links our professions , the fact of death . Then I asked , " Autopsy report ? " " I 'm the local M.D. , " said the second monk . The voice was a pleasant surprise . This monk was a doc and this doc was a woman . " You can call me Sister Jann , " she went on . " I 'm not a pathologist , but I did a full-body scan and opened him up for a cursory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single thrust by a thin , double-edged blade inserted posteriorly through the intercostal space between the fourth and fifth ribs . It nicked the aorta and leakage into the thoracic cavity killed him . Neat job , by the way , " she added with a touch of professional gusto . " Come to my office after Great Meditation and I 'll give you everything I have . " " The Inspector will be joining us for the ceremony , " came the CM 's vibra ting bass . He turned to me . " Brother Ion will take you to your cell . There you 'll find your luggage and a clean habit . Put it on and let him guide you . " " Why do I have to attend a ceremony ? I 'm not a monk , I 'm a cop , and I 'd like to get on with the investigation . " " It was at the Great Meditation three days ago that our brother was slain . To understand how it happened , you have to attend . " So there it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somehow , it had to do with this guy taking a shiv in the back . There was more to the religious life than I 'd expected . Let me make it clear that I have nothing against meditation . My wife Anna , who 's Chinese by birth and also a doc , believes in it on medical grounds - it tunes up the alpha waves in the brain , lowers blood pressure , cures warts and I do n't know what . Every day for years we 'd spent twenty minutes sitting on a rug back to back , hands pressed to our respective haras , eyes cast down , breathing out , letting nature do the breathing in . I found it nice . Relaxing . I was glad she made me do it . But for me it meant communion with myself and her , not with the cosmos . This , on the other hand , was clearly going to be a production . When I was robed and hooded , Ion led me back to D Ring and into a dim amphitheater . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cosmological get-togethers in the days when the orbital station was a scientific rather than a religious footstool to heaven . Below us , semicircular tiers funneled down to a stage holding a single empty chair like a throne . The only illumination came from a line of small red lights in the deck that divided the amphitheater into two unequal parts - more tiers below , fewer above . No seats ; here you squatted or sat on the floor . Ion seated me on the highest tier , then descended and took up the half-lotus position in an empty spot near the stage . I saw him loop another belt around himself . The drifting problem again . I did the same . Through open doors to the left and right other hooded figures began to enter , filling the lower tiers , settling with grants into either the lotus or the half-lotus posture , depending on how limber their joints were . A moment passed and then other figures , equally anonymous in their robes , began to enter and fill the tiers above the lights . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably the gladiator suspected of knifing Brother Kendo . Last of all the Chief Monk entered , robed and hooded . Leaning on one of his substantial arms was a tiny figure moving with a crablike gait . My first sight of Master Po , and I did n't see much - just one clawlike hand emerging from swathes of white . The CM deposited him on the throne and sat on the deck at his feet . The red lights went out . Profound darkness followed , the down-in-a-cavern dark that blinds even a cat . Then the CM 's voice boomed out like the thunder of an ancient god . " Thus , my brothers and my sisters , do all things begin . This is the original state of the cosmos , the abyss without form and without mode of the waste and wild Divinity . " His voice , if possible , deepened . " And then the forms of the universe emerged . " With a soft murmur of well-oiled machinery , the ceiling began to open . A long narrow V appeared and spread rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Terra into limitless spangled darkness . I sucked in my breath , and so did everybody else . The hall seemed to inhale . Going about your daily life , eating , sleeping , working , scratching your butt , you know it 's always there , this fathomlessness . But to see it this way , to be projected into it , was simply stupefying . " Brothers and sisters , behold your Self . That art thou , " intoned the voice , now issuing from noplace and everyplace . " Release yourselves from the bonds of ego . Release yourselves from the illusions of time and space . Know , feel , and experience the fact that this body , your body , already fills the ten parts of the universe . " He began to chant , and no human voice could have done it better than this invisible lion-faced monk . " Auummmmmmmm , " he intoned , and one hundred and twenty voices followed his lead . As the m-sound stretched out and out , it mimicked the harmonics of a great gong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt the belt tighten as if I were trying to levitate , as maybe I was . Another long tremolo of dying echoes . " Auummmmmmm , " came again as one voice . I was losing the sense of myself - or no , not that exactly : I was losing the sense that I 'm only myself . At first it scared me and I fought against it . I was afraid of the darkness , the antiphonal chant of voices and gong , the stupefying sky bending over me . Then gradually I stopped fighting . I let go , took a vacation from the ordinary . I was seeing with new eyes other forms of nature besides the transient atom called Robert - Robert Something . My name got lost . Like Alice in Wonderland , I was thinking , " L - I know it starts with L ! " The bronze cymbal crashed . The chant resumed . The chains of time and place broke apart silently . How easy it would 've been to slip off the belt , to let myself rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , as the Japanese call the Milky Way . I was thinking : the atoms , the particles , the quarks that make me also make this . The natural laws that bind me bind this as well . This is my true body , already filling the ten parts of the universe . This am I. All things together make a harmony , said Lao-Tzu . When not screwed up by human egotism and greed , added Kohn , unquenchably sardonic . Oh right , that was my name . Slowly the religious experience faded . I started to breathe normally again , though I still had a fizzy , light-headed feeling . Machinery was purring , the ceiling was closing , the red lights flickering on . The whole amphitheater exhaled , the people sadly returning to their mere local selves . I checked my watch . Astounding . I could 've sworn I 'd been here maybe twenty minutes . In fact , one hour , nine minutes and an eternity had elapsed . A long silence ensued . Then the Chief Monk stood up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . He returned to Master Po , helped him rise , and together they proceeded slowly out of the hall . Others began to follow . Guests were standing , stretching cramped limbs . Somebody broke wind . The Great Meditation was over for the day . FOLLOWING a light supper in a hall called the Refectory , I found my way to Sister Jann 's small cluttered office next to the infirmary . She was sitting in a comfortable-looking chair with her hood thrown back - another violation of Regulation 19 - and frowning at the shadowbox of a computer . Floating in the darkness of the box was a three-dimensional schematic of a lengthy molecule . She gestured at the model . " Recognize this ? We found it in a guest 's quarters during the aprs-murder shakedown . " The display looked somewhat familiar . " Maybe GLS ? " " Very good , Colonel . You 're almost right . It 's a hypermodern designer drug derived from gamma-lysergin , just as GLS had its ancestor in plain old ordinary LSD . This stuff wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too difficult to make . I suppose Councilor Mmahat uses it as an enhancer to his religious experiences . " " There 's a Councilor of State up here ? " " The biggest of our VIGs - our Very Important Guests . Represents the Middle Eastern Council District . Background in Sufi mysticism , rich as sin and terribly important and powerful . His enemies call him the Whirling Dervish , among many other things . Here , sit down , " she added , moving a Chinese paperweight and a heap of hardcopy to reveal a chair hiding beneath . I sat down and belted up . Sister Jann was a stocky woman with a short haircut and competent air . Her skin was almost translucent and her large gray eyes had the clear , unshockable calmness I 've noticed in nursing sisters of the Mother Teresa Guild . Looking at her , the first word that crossed my mind was " virginal . " Trying a friendly approach , I told her my wife was also an M.D. whom I met in space . To my surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's so typical . After centuries of effort , women still do n't get equal treatment in medicine on Earth . That 's why so many of us wind up in space . " Hastily I shifted my ground . " You know , Sister , the Chief Monk 's quite a surprise to me . Is n't he an unusual type for a lamasery ? " " Not really . In a religious community you need somebody with genuine insight to provide spiritual guidance , but you also need somebody to make things run . So there 's the Master , and there 's the CM , who very definitely knows how to make things run . " " I found him pretty impressive just now . " She shrugged . " He 's got charisma , I 'll admit that . But he 's about as deep as spit . This stuff he peddles - a little Taoism , a little Buddhism , a little this , a little that - it 's sort of Zen Lite . " " Thanks for your frank opinion . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because his machinery of spying - pardon me , his monitoring system - is broken and he 's still trying to get a technician up from Terra to fix it . It 's such an antique , he ca n't find parts for it . How 's the investigation going ? " " It 'll get started as soon as you give me the autopsy data on Brother Kendo and tell me exactly what happened to him . Incidentally , " I added , " whether you like the CM or not , he was absolutely right when he made me attend the Great Meditation . While that 's going on , anything could happen and never be noticed . " She nodded soberly . " It 's sad , really sad in a way . This is n't the first time somebody 's used a religious service as a cover for murder , you know . One of the Renaissance Popes tried to have Lorenzo de " Medici assassinated at high mass . The signal for the murderer to strike was the bell ringing at the consecration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She rummaged in her desk , pulled out a memory cube and gave it to me . " Here 's everything you never wanted to know about Brother Kendo . I also pulled his personnel records because the record keeper was Kendo himself , and as you know he 's in the refrigerator . So you 've got how he died , the state of his health prior to that , his retinagraph , DNA profile , personal history , his police record - or rather , his lack of one . In short , the works . " " I 'm sure it 'll make good reading . Now suppose you tell me something about the guy that 's not in the records . " " He was a rather boring , sullen man . A loner . Hid himself away in the archives most of the time . Very good with numbers , I ca n't imagine why the CM did n't put him in the treasurer 's office . Kendo had a temper , usually under control but not always . One day for no visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard that he broke three bones in his hand . While I was splinting the hand I said , " Now , brother , what made you blow up like that ? " He said , " It 's private , " and that was all I could get out of him . " " So he was a guy with internal tension . " " Yes . But internal tension did n't kill him . " " Tell me about the crime . " She leaned back and put her fingertips together . A lot of technical experts make that gesture when they 're about to give testimony . Makes them look judicious . " Considering that everybody in the station was present , the crime was astonishingly easy to miss . A single outcry , so they say . I doubt if many people even heard it . I know I did n't . When the lights came on , Brother Kendo was sitting just below the lights with one hand clutching his chest . People were turning and looking at him . The brother seated nearest asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . In the heart . ' " " Very accurate , that , " I murmured . " Well , Kendo had an esophageal hernia , so chest pains were an old story for him . It did n't seem serious at first , not even to him . Nevertheless , he looked quite pale and two brothers asked him if he could walk . He said yes . They helped him up and he walked to the door . There he fainted . By the time they got him to the infirmary , he was dead . It was only when they undressed him that they noticed a bloodstain on his undershirt . Almost all the bleeding was internal . You should 've seen the mess when I opened him up . " " Can you tell me why the CM thinks one of the guests did it ? " " For one thing , only guests were sitting behind Kendo . Besides , the killing was skillful , you know . Professional . Well , we 've got a professional among the guests , as you may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Must do real combat . He had a cyst on his back , took his robe off to let me work on it , and I can tell you he 's got more scar tissue than skin . " " Do you think he 's guilty ? " " I do not . Why in the world would a champion gladiator travel thirtysix thousand clicks into space to kill a morose , silent , friendless , penniless monk ? The Chief Monk 's trying to screw up your mind , " she added , going back to her bte noire . " He does n't want the killer to be a monk , because that would be embarrassing , and he does n't want the killer to be one of his important guests because that would cost the lamasery a donor . That 's why he 's scapegoating Huksa Byung . " " Was there any physical evidence ? " " Not in the hall , with all those people tramping around . At least none that we could find . We 're not set up here to do real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for occult blood - neoluminol , black light and so forth . No luck . Brother Ion - he 's the CM 's enforcer , you know led a search of every cubic centimeter of living and storage space in Heaven 's Footstool , trying to find the weapon . No luck for him either . " " I presume the guests were also searched ? " " Patted down by a monk or nun . " " Body cavity searches ? " " Impossible , Inspector . You do n't do a digital on a Councilor of State 's rectum unless he agrees to it . Nor on Huksa Byung either , unless he agrees . Besides , the knife had to have a blade at least twenty centimeters long and must have been razor sharp . You might want to hide that in a body cavity , but I would not . " " Anything like that in your medical kit that somebody could have borrowed ? " " No . I do have a few scalpels for jobs like puncturing the gladiator 's cyst , but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite a fanatic about his no-weapons policy and everything that even looks dangerous gets catalogued and locked away . The chances are overwhelming that the weapon was brought here in somebody 's luggage , and that 's another reason the CM 's convinced the villain 's a guest . You know , " she added , " I do n't like the man . He 's a bully and a faker . But I do think he wants to find out who killed Kendo . The murder scares him , it baffles him , and he 's not a man who likes being either baffled or scared . " That seemed to cover it . I pocketed the cube , got up to go . Then stopped . Before leaving , I wanted to satisfy my curiosity on one point that had nothing to do with the murder . I asked when Heaven 's Footstool turned coed . " It 's an experiment . I 'm all for it , integrating the monks and the nuns . Some are starting to marry one another , and I 'm all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All this is rather different from the lamaseries on Terra , " I commented . " Our brothers and sisters down below follow the ancient rules of sexual segregation and forced celibacy . But they 'll come to see our viewpoint in the end . " " I have n't heard of any murders in lamaseries down below . " " Perhaps they have no guests , " smiled Sister Jann . IRONICALLY - for a retired cop - my room was called a cell . It lived up to the name . Two meters by three , with a single bed , desk , chair , wash stand with a Lucite dome and a vacuum pump to recover water and cleanser . Wall clock , waste-material vent , the usual belts on the chair and bed , everything clamped to the deck . I 'd already located the nearest latrine and shower room , down the corridor . I assumed that VIGs had more luxurious accommodations , but did n't really expect them for myself . I 'd had a long day , but decided to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speed about the victim when I started interviewing people in the morning . The clock murmured that the time - Heaven 's Footstool used Greenwich Mean Time - was 2040 and Lights Out would come at 2130 . I lay down on the bunk , took out my omni , inserted the cube , and on the ten-by-ten cm screen Brother Kendo 's life started unreeling . He was born Drago Stancic fifty-four years ago in the warrens of the Luna Underground . Librarian and information control tech by profession . Married young , fathered two children whose present whereabouts were unknown . No police record on either Luna or Terra . Served briefly in the military without either distinction or disgrace . Divorced by his wife on grounds of incompatibility . Then the big break in his life . Thirteen years ago he entered a lamasery , at that time making over his small worldly wealth to the Order . His satorist recorded that he made a " significant spiritual breakthrough into cosmic consciousness " nine years ago . After post-enlightenment training , he requested a transfer to Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assigned to keep the personnel records . Further useless facts : Brother Kendo weighed seventy-eight kilos at his last physical before leaving Terra , stood one point six meters tall , had a sexual-orientation rating of point nine het , and suffered from a hiatal hernia , marginal blood-sugar , and a tendency to hyperlipidemia . He died in possession of his tonsils , appendix , and foreskin , the lucky devil . He was " predominantly celibate , " whatever that might mean . His work record was good .... I suppose at that point I conked out . When I woke , wondering where the hell I was , the overhead light was still on . The omni had switched itself off . It lay on my chest , a silvery oblong twenty-five cm long . A bell was shrilling someplace in the corridor outside . Wondering why my whole body felt stiff and cold , I fantasized briefly that I was Brother Kendo laid out in the freezer . In short , I was disoriented . Then the clock - displaying 0430 - informed me in the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour to prepare for compulsory tai-chi muscle-toning exercises in Earthside Hall , followed by zazen or sitting meditation , followed by breakfast at 0700 in the Refectory . A new day had come to Heaven 's Footstool , and I rose up like Frankenstein , laid the omni on the desk , and staggered toward the door to meet it . I spent the next thirty minutes in the company of a large number of male and female monks unhooded , as we all performed our morning rituals in the latrine and shower room . Interesting . The brother-and-sister lingo seemed to fit the way the men and women actually treated one another . Shower stalls had doors and small dressing cubicles and formed private spaces for whoever was occupying them . The general atmosphere resembled a unisex barracks or college dorm , though noisier because of the gulping sounds of the vacuum plumbing . Then the community shuffled off , many sticky boots moving at once , in what I guessed was the direction of Earthside Hall . Did n't figure I needed muscle-toning myself , since I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to jelly . Instead , after robing I wandered the corridors until appetizing smells started to emanate from the Refectory . Here I dawdled until the monks appeared , then stepped in among them , noting with interest how easily one more robed figure could be absorbed into the throng unnoticed . Breakfast turned out to be a subdued affair , eaten in silence-porridge and strong green tea , loaves of fresh hot bread from the monks " own bakery and jars of fruit preserves with labels from half the farming regions of Terra . Meanwhile a reader perched on a dais read from the Tao Teh Ching . Anna introduced me to Lao-tzu , her fellow Chinese , and I 've grown to like him as an honest man . " The Great Tao is without pity , it burns the families of men like straw dogs , " intoned the reader . That I know to be true . The cosmos is fascinating , but it lacks a heart . As I was finishing , a monk tapped me on the shoulder and Brother Ion 's gruff voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " like yesterday , " as he put it . So I followed him out , trying to arrange in my head a plausible plan of action with which to appease his holiness . The Reverend Aung Chai sat at his desk in exactly the same posture as before - one forearm flat , the other raised . " Sit , sit , " he said . " I want to know what you 've found out , if anything , and what theories of the crime you may have formed . " He glanced at his wall clock . " Ten minutes , " he added . I gave him the usual bureaucratic run-around . If you have n't accomplished anything , you try to look busy . I explained I 'd reviewed Kendo 's records and discussed the autopsy findings with Sister Jann . I regretted the fact that a scientific examination had n't been made of the crime scene . Whatever evidence might have been found by now had been hopelessly corrupted , so interrogation would have to do the trick . I proposed to start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days and some of them might want to go home . " As I told you , " he said abruptly , " I suspect one of them is guilty . You know which one . " " You may be right . But I 'm not yet convinced that any guest did it . " I got that terrific frown again . " Exactly why not ? " I paused to appreciate the " exactly , " then went into my spiel . " With everybody dressed alike at the Great Meditation and the dim lights and all the shuffling around , I do n't see why a monk could n't have slipped in among the guests in the corridor , entered with them and sat down behind Kendo . Then mingled with the monks again during the confusion afterward . I mean , nobody was counting , right ? " The frown deepened . " Do you find that scenario more believable than mine ? If so , why ? " I was getting sick of being grilled . So I spoke a bit more frankly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hatreds . Too many incompatible people living too close together . That sort of thing could provide a motive , and I 'm sure you realize that the question of motive is fundamental . I naturally wonder why a guest - all of them wellheeled , from what I hear , and at least one a powerful public figure-would travel thirty-six thousand clicks just to stab a middle-aged monk . That also goes for your gladiator . " I was practically quoting Sister Jann . He did n't look terribly happy , but he did n't argue either . I could almost see the wheels turning inside that huge head . If the gladiator did n't do it , he 'd prefer the guilty party to be a monk . Anything to shield his VIGs . But I was n't finished . " However , there 's another scenario that makes Kendo a more plausible victim . With the dim lights and everybody looking more or less the same , the killer might have made a mistake . After all , this murder was literally a stab in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the case , then the real target of the attack is still in danger . And that means you ca n't afford to dawdle . We have some important people here , especially Councilor Mmahat . What would happen if a Councilor of State were murdered , I ca n't imagine . " On the contrary , I saw in his face that he could imagine it only too well . The uproar that would follow on Terra . The media overkill . The speeches in the Council . Maybe even Heaven 's Footstool losing its sovereignty ! " Then perhaps I 'd better get to work . " " By all means . " Those mesmeric eyes did n't , however , let me go . " Wait a minute . I just realized something . A few years back-were n't you the fellow they blamed for the catastrophe on Planet BeIa ? " " Yes . Because I made the mistake of surviving . " " Well , try not to make another mistake , Colonel . This is serious , very serious . I 'll expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And that appeared to be that . The dark unblinking eyes followed me through the door , where Brother Ion or somebody shaped exactly like him waited with his fists opening and closing . Maybe just exercise ? Or maybe he had internal tensions , too . During my pre-breakfast walk , I 'd noticed a section of the B Ring marked Reserved for Honored Guests . I found it again and started exploring . Here every door had a nameplate but I found no Huksa Byung . Checked again , found Rhee - the only name that looked Korean - and knocked . The man who opened the door resembled a bronze ingot in a white robe , only much bigger . Shaved and polished scalp , keloid ridges on ears and brows . I explained why I was here and he nodded me in . The cell of a paying guest turned out to be considerably larger than mine and boasted a separate bedroom and a private bath . Still , everything was pretty austere , all the furniture bare and bolted down in the usual fashion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossom made of faux silk . Well , in the East the cherry blossom - odd as it seems to western eyes - is a traditional symbol of the warrior . It 's the only reminder I could see of Rhee 's earthly profession . " Someone told me your name is Huksa Byung , " I began . " That 's the name I fight under . It means Black Death . " He smiled . He had several gold teeth showing . " It makes my opponents uneasy . " " I just bet it does . Are you a barehanded fighter , or - " " Or a knife fighter ? " Quick golden grin again . " No , I do straight Tae Kwan Do . Korean karate . Never liked those closed-channel butcheries where they use cesti and knives and spurs like animals . Fighting barehanded or in gloves , it 's more like an art . Of course , people sometimes die anyway . When you 're in the habit of breaking stones with your hands , you 're bound to break bones occasionally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , minus the pot belly . Considering he probably knew seventeen ways to kill me with one blow , he was an affable fellow . I suppose he could afford to be . " Can I ask why you came to Heaven 's Footstool ? " " Wanted to see what it 's like . Meditation 's a fine discipline . It 's the opposite of the rough stuff , and therefore provides balance . Yin and yang , sort of . Also it purges the fear of death and , after all , my business is facing death . Sometimes handing it out . Whenever I kill an opponent , I always bow down to him , honor his spirit . Set up a tablet with his name in the Warrior Temple in New Seoul . After all , there 's no real difference between slayer and slain . " " ' We be of one blood , thou and I. ' " Quoting Kipling , one of my favorite ancient authors . " Yes , exactly . I 'm always aware that the guys I happen to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect . " This was the most civilized conversation about killing people I 'd ever had . Pretty soon Black Death had his wallet out , showing me pictures of his wives and children . " I make all my kids learn self-defense , but I also tell them , " You decide to become a gladiator , I 'll break your arms ! " I do n't want them running the risks I do . " We finally got down to the Great Meditation at which Kendo was killed . Black Death claimed that he sat two tiers above the victim and did n't notice that anything was wrong until the man passed out near the door . " Recognize any of the people sitting around you ? " " Not really . Well , Councilor Mmahat was sitting right in front of me , I could recognize him by his height . He 's nearly as tall as you are . But with the darkness and the chanting and all - no , I did n't really notice anybody else . Just row after row after row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a memorial temple . You know , " he added thoughtfully , " the murder was really a professional job . Bold , but also cold . I like that . It shows class . " My reaction to Mr. Black Death was that he showed class , too . Also , I was extremely glad I 'd never have to fight him . So I said good-bye , stepped out into the corridor , found Mmahat 's door and knocked softly . It was thrown open by a large man with black eyes and scimitar nose set in a long , horsy face . " Ah yes ! " he cried . " You 're the inspector . Come in . Come in ! " His expression seemed to say : Your superiors grovel to me , so I know you will , too . I entered a large room whose walls were decorated with shields bearing intricate inscriptions in Arabic . On a mother-of-pearl inlaid table with magnetized strips a veiled serving woman was laying out bowls covered by clear plastic . Two lustrous dark eyes rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her veil covered her top to toe , but was nearly transparent , and it rippled like clear dark water over opulent breasts and hips . The Councilor knew how to choose a handmaiden . Reluctantly removing my gaze from the houri , I saw through a halfopen door a bedroom - a serving bot was making the bed - and one corner of a bathroom sheathed in gold panels . Not only were guests better off than monks , some guests were more equal than others . Class distinctions had invaded heaven - or at any rate , Heaven 's Footstool . The Councilor sat down to breakfast , and I was permitted to sit and interview him . He sipped a tiny container of Turkish coffee through a straw , but did n't offer me any . " You want to talk about this murder , of course , " he said . He had a resonant voice , accustomed to large halls and no contradiction . " Yes , your excellency . " " I was the one who convinced the CM to send for a professional to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , putting important people in danger . Of course , whatever you find out , it 'll all have to be hushed up . Catch the bastard , push him through the airlock , and move on . Ca n't have religion getting a black eye . Wealth , know-how , and the mysteries of faith - those are the three legs the world system stands on . I was raised to worship Allah , and I have Christian and Jewish colleagues I respect deeply " - he gazed at me meaningfully , as much as to say Jews like you - " but there 's no doubt that with China and India dominating the earth , this pan-Asian stuff the White Monks teach is the elephant in today 's religious menagerie . " Does n't matter a bit , that 's my view . All roads lead to Roma , et cetera . New Angkor in this case . What counts is having the prevailing religion , whatever it is , bless the system that runs the world . " " Just so , " I murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellency will be a most important witness . " " Important ! I should say so ! I saw the crime happen ! " " You sawit happen ? " Mmahat liberated a round rice cake from its prison in a bowl , let it float upward , captured it and spread it with some sort of jelly . " Yes , " he mumbled , chewing . " Of course I did n't know it at the time . I 'd found a place right behind the lights . The CM proceeded to do his act - absolutely marvelous ! If he had n't dedicated his life to religion , he 'd be in the Council of State today . Astounding performance ! Where was I ? " " You sat down behind the lights . " " Yes . Not entirely satisfactory , that . They really should have a section reserved for people who matter . I 've brought that to the CM 's attention . But anyway . During the meditation I was simply enraptured , moved more profoundly , I believe , than the monks themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be surprised if I levitated just a bit . " Remembering the super GLS discovered in his quarters , I found this easy to believe . " Then , as the roof was closing I began to descend , so to speak . Yet my mind remained crystal clear . Crystal clear , " he repeated , as if he 'd just coined the phrase . " Suddenly I heard a cry . Not loud , but sharp and close at hand . A couple of meters away on the first tier below the lights - which were beginning to flicker on-I caught a movement in the corner of one eye and turned my head . An arm in a white sleeve was touching the back of the monk who 'd made the sound . I thought someone was asking him to be quiet . Then the arm withdrew . The monk halfway rose to his feet and two others got up and went to him to see what was wrong . I heard a voice say " pain , " think - yes , it said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of them moved off toward the end of the tier . Then , of course , everybody was rising , stretching if they felt cramped and so forth . I was heading for the door myself when I saw that the fellow had fallen , and several monks were bending over him . " He selected a hard-boiled egg , peeled it , and let the fragments of shell drift away . The handmaiden approached with serpentine grace and began capturing the bits of shell in midair with a tiny net such as goldfish fanciers keep . " Getting back to my original statement , " Mmahat went on , " I actually saw the murder take place . Absolutely fascinating . When I get back to New Angkor , I 'll be dining out on the story for months . " " Hard on the monk , of course , " I murmured . " Yes , poor devil . However , I do n't suppose he had much of a life anyway . " He continued to eat his breakfast . I rose , stole a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to how far I should trust Mmahat 's testimony , and what use I could make of it if true , I had at that moment no idea whatsoever . WELL , THERE 'S NO USE repeating most of the stories I spent that long , tedious day listening to . Like most witnesses , the VIGs divided into two groups , those who remembered nothing useful , and those who remembered things that had never happened . Still , I did get a good feel for the lamasery 's A-list . Quite a who's-who of prominent people who either had spiritual interests or liked to pretend they had . A couple of trillionaires , an artist who did holographic portraits said to be superior to Rembrandt 's , society women with time on their hands ( at least three of whom indicated they might find me interesting in an unofficial capacity , say later on that night ) . Plus some pale youngsters with drug problems , trust funds , and no idea how to make sense of their lives . The very last interview of the day turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed like more of the same . " Immensely healthy and inspiring , " said the witness , a Grande Dame of the Solar System , an elderly lady who looked , and undoubtedly was , rich . She spoke in squeaks and harsh grating noises , like a very expensive parrot . Actually , the Grande Dame had seen nothing that contributed in any way to solving the murder . But she was quite willing to bend my ears with accounts of her life on Earth , which sounded pretty tedious , since she lived surrounded by a legion of bots and human servants who did everything for her except digest her food . Heaven 's Footstool was her great escape from the banality of wealth . She came every year , - said it cost her seven hundred thousand a pop , but was worth it . ( I surmised that if it cost less , she 'd value it accordingly and stay home . ) Living under weightless or near-weightless conditions was so good for the arteries . She slept better there than anyplace except in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monk possessed incredible charisma . On her last visit he gave her a koan or spiritual problem to work on . She gave him a conventional answer , and he slapped her - not very hard , but hard enough to destroy the cocoon of pride she used to live in . " I really feel that was the moment of my awakening , " she said . I was beginning to envy the CM . But of course cops do n't swat Grande Dames . Lest I be tempted to do so , I got up . " Thank you for your assistance , my lady , " I murmured , bowing and kissing her thin blue-veined hand . She saw me to her door , never ceasing to chatter . " Such a disgraceful crime ... profaning a holy place ... like King Henry the Whatever , back in the Christian era , murdering that archbishop fellow on the altar ... the poor man , slaughtered in the very place where he thought he 'd found sanctuary .... " I was halfway through the door when I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just where who found sanctuary ? " I demanded . " Why , the poor fellow who was murdered . I saw him in the infirmary one day when I went in for a shot . He 'd been injured somehow , he was lying down and his hood was pushed back . I recognized him at once . He used to run an investment bank in New Manhattan . Oh , he was just a teeny bit crooked , everybody knew that , that was how he was able to earn his more select clients such wonderful returns on their money . I was so shocked when the police came after him . You know these government prosecutors , always putting the worst possible construction on everything . Anyway , he got away in time , but until I saw him up here I did n't know where he 'd escaped to . Now what was his name - some Slavic name . Kristovsky ? No ... Krovich , that was it ! I never forget anyone who makes me richer . " I bowed and kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone else , " I cautioned her . " Remember , the killer 's still at large and might decide to silence you . " " Oh , how thrilling ! I do think , Inspector , that this has been my most profoundly interesting visit here ever . I 'll be silent as the grave until I get home , and then tell simply everyone ! " Back in my cell , seated , belt clasping my haia , I tried to make sense of the few dubious pearls of information that my long , mostly boring day had brought me . Heaven 's Footstool was silent , everybody but me at the Great Meditation . I 'd grabbed some leftovers from the kitchen so I could eat a light supper alone and concentrate on the case . Questions : Should I arrest the gladiator , even though I think he 's innocent ? Could I trust the Councilor , even though he 's a druggie ? Should I believe the Grande Dame , even though she 's a fool ? The only checkable item was the real identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names - Kendo , Stancic , and Krovich . Decided to run the memory cube Sister Jann gave me through security 's central archives . My omni did the sending in a few milliseconds . Then I sat and ate bread and cheese and sipped wine through a straw , wishing Anna were there to share the goodies with me . Nine minutes later , I got a return message confirming the data . The info on the cube matched exactly the dossier of Stancic , Drago , who took the name Kendo when he went religious . Nothing about anybody named Krovich . So that took care of the Grande Dame , with her probably failing memory , her boring life , and her consequent love of self-dramatization . She 'd made up the story , that 's all . Or did she ? Hmm . Liars , damn liars , and government archives . I never worked Fraud , and the name Krovich meant nothing to me . Nor did the man 's face . Yet I could think offhand of at least three famous homicides - important person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply evaporated into thin air . Or into empty space . I mean , look : If I assumed the records were right , I had nothing . If I assumed the Grande Dame was right - wow ! A stunningly rich field for speculation . Heaven 's Footstool . Legally a sovereign world , untouchable by Terran authorities . Perhaps granted its sovereignty precisely because well-heeled people sometimes need a getaway , and I do n't mean a place to recharge their spiritual power packs . And by providing them a refuge , many , many other people could assure themselves of substantial bribes . Great Tao , but it must have been expensive to get there ! I could imagine a lifetime of ill-gotten gains vanishing like smoke as a refugee from the law bribed whole layers of officialdom to create a false identity , embed it in the central records , issue a forged exit visa , and make it worthwhile for the White Monks to accept and conceal him . How frustrated Krovich must have been , a financier reduced to the life of a common monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others . No wonder he punched a rib of nuclear steel . A private matter , he told Sister Jann . Yes - very private . But was all this really possible ? I sat drumming my fingers , wishing I had Anna to talk it over with . I could call her at home , of course , but somebody up here could very well monitor the call , and certainly it would be picked up Earthside by security . And if by any chance I was right about what was going on , at least a few people at HQ had to be in on it . Heaven 's Footstool . The Flying Vatican . Suddenly I was remembering an anecdote Sister Jann told me about a homicidal Pope . Maybe , I thought , I 'd better refresh my memory about the original Vatican . I knew it was centuries back in the Christian Era , during the Age of the Warring States - maybe even earlier , in the Middle Ages . And that was about all . I told the omni , " Research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seconds the answer began to unroll . Vatican , a hill just outside what was now the village of Roma in the European Council District . A long , colorful history . Magnificent ruins still visited by tourists . A hologram popped up , showing a vast shattered temple with statues of gods defaced by time , weather , and war . Once the Popes ruled Roma , then it was taken over by a nation called Italia . In the twentieth century the Vatican was made an independent micro-state to give the chief priest of the Christians political independence . But it also became a refuge for all sorts of unpleasant characters who happened to have an in with the church bureaucracy-absconding bankers ( ! ) , right-wing politicians with blood on their hands , prominent churchmen tarred by pedophile scandals . In time its reputation became so bad that the Vatican State was abolished and reabsorbed into Italia . I went on reading for an hour or more . It was the first time I 'd gotten an overview of this lost world , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . Among them were saints , ascetics , statesmen and scholars - also fools , debauchees , fanatics , and monsters . So everything I 'd been imagining already happened , long ago . A holy place becomes a refuge for unholy characters . Lao-tzu again : Au things are blight on one side and dark on the other . Damn tiresome of history , telling the same old stories over and over . But now I 'd got at least a glimmer of a possible motive . Somebody going into space to kill a middle-aged monk - highly improbable . But what if the monk was an absconding banker ? What if somebody that Krovich had cheated in the past found out where he was hiding , and either sent an assassin or came to do the job himself ? Mr. Black Death . Yes , even if I liked the guy , I had to admit he was prime material for a hired killer . Maybe getting a bit old for fighting , wanted to spend some years in peace at home with his family . Killing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly , only much more rewarding . There was a lot more to the religious life than I 'd realized . This was starting to sound like Renaissance Roma . I 'd just been reading about a Pope who had his bravos grind a cheap diamond to powder and sprinkle it on Bevenuto Cellini 's dinner in order to perforate his intestines . That , I thought , was even nastier than At that exact moment the screaming started . It came from the corridor outside , pretty close to my door . I unbuckled my seatbelt and jumped up , nearly launching myself against the ceiling , and ran out , stuffing the omni into my pocket after remembering at the last second to set it on Record . Then followed the sounds up the corridor to D Ring . A crowd had formed near the airlock . The usual anonymous whiterobed figures , now agitated , chattering away as if there were no Regulation 4 , no rule of silence . I shouldered my way through and halted , staring into the open lock . It was crowded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed to the front . The corpse was frosted over , another chunk of frozen meat , lying on his right side with knees bent . " Who 's this ? " I demanded . " It 's Brother Ion , " said an anonymous figure . I tried to turn back the stiff cloth of his hood and it cracked like glass , broke off and burned my fingers like dry ice . For a moment I was stunned , just staring . Then I shooed the monks out of the airlock like a flock of chickens and turned back to the body . So this is what Ion looked like . A set , square gray face , scarred on the cheek , the visible left eye fixed and bulging , a bristle of beard covered with hoarfrost now beginning to melt in the warm air entering from D Ring . Oh yes , I knew him . Not the name - it had been a long time since I saw his dossier . But he was another fugitive , and the charge against him was murder . Multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing much of my life . As I worked , recording hundreds of angles on the omni , another kind of recognition began to dawn . Krovich had rested in a completely different posture , flat on his belly , back up . Yet gazing at Ion , I felt an overwhelming sense of dj vu - felt it all over again , as the philosopher said . Here was another chunky , bearded , middle-aged man of medium height , wrapped in webs of ice . Bizarre thoughts went flickering through my head . Some killers pursue a certain physical type . Especially sexual predators , with their specialized appetites for girls , boys , hookers , blondes , brunettes - even for dwarves , the crippled , or the blind . But somebody with a compulsion to kill middle-sized , middle-aged men with beards ? I was shaking my head over that when Sister Jann slipped into the lock , carrying her medical bag . She viewed Brother Ion , muttered " Oh dear , " then asked , " Can you turn him on his back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrenched the body over . Like turning an ice statue . No wound appeared , but something just as informative did . A murmur ran through the onlookers in the doorway-also several stifled laughs . Everybody was looking at the little tent of white cloth over Brother Ion 's crotch . The corpse had an erection , a substantial one at that , frozen in place . Sister Jann shook her head . " Things become more and more embarrassing , " she murmured . Abruptly the monks scattered as the CM erupted into the lock . All by himself , he seemed to overfill it . " What 's this ? " he roared . " What 's this ? " Since the answer was perfectly obvious , neither Sister Jann nor I said anything . " My right hand , " muttered the CM . " First they sabotaged the monitoring system . Now they 've cut off my right hand . " " They who ? " I asked , ungrammatically . " My enemies . It 's a campaign . It 's a deliberate campaign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The huge face turned up and gave me the fierce heartless stare of a wounded lion . " What the hell have you been doing all day ? " he demanded . " Why did n't you prevent this ? " I stepped back , pushed by the almost palpable aura of rage and fear flowing from the Reverend Aung Chai . I said nothing because , once again , there was nothing to say . Breathing heavily , he rose to his feet . Great Tao but the man was big . I 'm used to looking down on people , but he looked me straight in the eye . He said in a quieter voice , quieter but perhaps more dangerous , " I want a complete report on this in the morning . Complete . Do n't think , Colonel , you have forever to stop this ... this thing . " Then he was gone , whirling monks out of his way like chaff . At Sister Jann 's orders , a couple of monks broke the corpse loose from the deck and pushed it-floating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen . I followed , walking beside her , pondering a case that suddenly had too much data instead of too little . " Ion skipped the Great Meditation ? " I asked . " So it would seem . " " But not alone . " " No , that does n't seem likely . Well , nobody counts the attendees , you know . Over a hundred people , dressed all alike . The darkness , the chanting .... " " I know . Will you do the post-mortem tonight ? " " Yes . Not that there 's much doubt about how he died . He was quickfrozen . But after the body thaws , I want to check him over thoroughly before rigor sets in . " I was turning to go when something struck me . " One question , Sister . What was Ion 's orientation rating ? " She looked baffled . " One-point-oh het . Rather unusual . These days , most people are a bit more ambiguous than that . But why do you - " " Excuse me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meditate . " SOMETIMES you just have to sit down and think , hard work though it is . But before I began trying to put the pieces together , I figured I 'd better call my wife . I 'd have done so the night before , except that I fell asleep over Brother Kendo 's bio . " I thought you 'd forgotten about me , " she said . " Never . How 's everything in Manypalms ? " " Oh , the usual . Mr. Applebaum had a stroke , but I got to him in time and he 's resting comfortably , or as comfortably as you can at the age of a hundred and six . Sometimes I wonder if living as long as people do nowadays really is a good idea . Your martial arts class called , they want to know when you 're coming back to break piles of bricks with them . Speaking of that , how 's the investigation going ? " Bearing in mind the possibility of being overheard , I told her , oh , things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my asthma was acting up - a private code we 'd agreed on before I left , meaning Are you in danger ? I said no , no symptoms worth mentioning , " If I feel it coming on , " I added , " I 'll know what to do . " Incautiously , I added a few words of praise for her fellow medico , Sister Jann . " Oh ? " Anna said , in an absolutely neutral voice . " Oh , come on . She 's a nun , and celibate besides . Anyway , I 'm too old to fool around . " " Too old - you ? ? " she asked , with just the right amount of exaggerated wonder , and we enjoyed a chuckle . Before signing off , she asked when I 'd be back . " Before you think , " I told her . At that moment I knew I was going to do whatever in the hell it took to get my aging butt back home soonest . I settled down to work . Anna taught me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Zen was originally Chinese ; it was called Ch'an , and there 's a Chinese pun that says , " The taste of Ch'an ( Zen ) is the taste of ch'a ( tea ) . " Figuring that was a good idea , I revisited the kitchen and brought back a pot of strong black stuff to clarify my thoughts and help me stay awake . I put a straw into the teapot through a flexible nipple and settled down . I assumed the half-lotus position , belted in , and spent a while sipping , my mind blank , just breathing in and out . Do n't think ... do n't think ... now , think ! I began reviewing the evidence , playing sections of my recordings back from time to time to refresh my memory . About midnight I started to draw conclusions . First , there was no longer the slightest doubt about the CM hiding fugitives on Heaven 's Footstool . Ion 's real name still eluded me , but his face was engraved on my memory from the time when - ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to a task force that hunted him without success . Not an impulse killer , either . The man was a pro . A skilled assassin , not a simple murderer . Checking the Security records for more data on him would be pointless . I already knew that by the time a fugitive reached this - what did the Grande Dame call it ? - this sanctuary , the records had already been purged . By now his physical data adorned a bland biography either stolen from some innocuous citizen , or made up out of the whole cloth . Only the brain of an aging cop had proved impossible to reprogram . What mattered , I told myself , was that I knew who murdered Brother Kendo . Why the job looked so professional . Why it took place at exactly the right place and time , when everybody 's attention was absorbed elsewhere . Why the weapon was n't found - after all , Ion himself led the search . Now for the real question : Who hired Ion for the job ? Okay , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So maybe Aung Chai had been right after all when he accused a guest . The guest did n't do the killing , of course . The CM 's own " right hand " and enforcer did it , proving only that assassins are apt to be bad employees . But a guest suborned the murder . Why ? I did n't know , but I knew I 'd damn well have to find out before I arrested him.Yes , I said him . The fact that Ion was a perfect heterosexual and died in a state of arousal had caused me to waste a couple of hours suspecting a woman - until I remembered Councilor Mmahat and his sinuous handmaiden . Despite his act of pomposity , snobbery , and self-important foolishness , underneath lay a much deeper and darker character - or so I now believed . One who purchased a murder with money , drugs , and the promise of sex with the most seductive female in Heaven 's Footstool . Then used her to lure the killer ( maybe befuddled in advance with GLS ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security Forces colleagues had ever tried to get the goods on a Councilor of State . Not many , I bet . I 'd have to have everything nailed down , and actual proof would be hell to find . I was still brooding when the clock coolly announced 0430 , startling me . The whole night was gone and , more than anything else , right now I wanted a shower and breakfast . Later I 'd have to see Sister Jann to get the autopsy report on Ion . And I 'd have to report to the CM - not exactly an inviting prospect , now that I knew him for what he was . Then the struggle to get Mmahat before the shuttle arrived to whisk him home , where he had power enough to stop any investigation . I needed to get him here , while he was far from home in a sovereign world where he was not a Councilor of State . I needed help . I needed somebody with power to back me up . Well , I knew only too well where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I might also know where I could . The military , with its unerring ear for the gross , thus sums up the beginning of a new day : shit , shave , shower , and shine . Only you ca n't shine stickums . The usual good breakfast followed , the reader on the dais delivering some stuff from the Diamond Sutra I did n't understand at all . " These " h'ving beings , " so called , are not really living beings at all . Such is only a word . " In context , that gave me a bit of a shiver . I had my interview with the CM right after breakfast . It was at best painful , since I viewed him as an abettor of criminals and he viewed me as a failure at my job . " Maybe it would have been better , " he began grimly , " if security had n't sent us someone quite so old . " Setting the tone of confrontation early . He had n't asked me to sit down , so for once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tawny locks , the ginger fur on the backs of his big hands . I could 've told him that I was completing my theory of the case . That I knew the guilty party . That with his backing , I could probably gather the evidence I needed , and go on home . Right . The very suggestion that I might be thinking of arresting the most important of all his Very Important Guests would 've caused an explosion fit to knock Heaven 's Footstool right out of orbit . Besides , I was enraged by having to work for and with this sleazy criminal . So instead of asking for help , I went for his jugular . " Why did n't your Reverence tell me you suspect a conspiracy ? Did you send to Terra because Ion could n't find out anything useful , you needed help and could n't trust anybody here ? " " I 'll ask the questions . I 'm in charge here . " " Tell that to your dead dogsbody . There must have been other incidents before Kendo 's killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? When did you first begin to suspect a conspiracy ? " " You know everything you need to know . In fact you know more . " " I know a lot more . Years ago I was engaged in hunting Brother Ion , or whatever his real name is , on a murder charge . " That stopped him . He eyed me the way a treed puma eyes a hunting dog . Unlike the dog , I could go after him , only modifying the truth a little to protect the Grande Dame . " In checking security 's records , I also found out that Brother Kendo 's real name is Krovich and that he 's a fugitive on a fraud charge . Just how many of these characters are you sheltering , your Reverence ? " " I was told - " he said , and snapped his jaws shut . " That the records had been purged , I suppose . So they were , but not competently . Who 's your contact in the archives at security HQ ? " " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I choose to grant you . You 're here to investigate a homicide - two homicides now - and turn the guilty party over to me for judgment by the Master . You know , Colonel , I can call eighty-eight monks to my aid at any time , if you force me to deal with you as a new threat . " " Yes , and I 'm sure you will , too , with thirty-three well-heeled guests looking on . Incidentally , you have only eighty-seven monks now , and I 'm not by any means sure that all or even most of them are loyal to you . Even when they wear white robes , criminals have a stink all their own . " Our dialogue continued in this friendly fashion for another twenty minutes , after which I turned on my heel and walked out . At any rate , the shouting match cleared the air . He was right that I was bound by my orders and that I had no independent authority . I was right about everything else . So that 's just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the help I need . Sister Jann was already in her office , breakfasting on a chunk of fragrant bread and a cup of milk that she sucked noisily through a straw . She was wide awake , but with a frazzled look . I greeted her and she gestured me into the other chair . " The tension 's starting to get me , " she apologized . " I did n't sleep at all . " " Murder has that effect , " I told her . " As Shakespeare did not say , murder doth murder sleep . " She smiled wanly . " I checked Ion 's body last night . Under the robe , he 's one of the hairiest specimens I 've ever seen . A kind of ape man . Maybe a double-Y-chromosome freak . But I was too tired to run his DNA and see . Oh , one thing . On his left shoulder he had the tattoo of a rat . " " Standard . That 's the ancient symbol of the Ninja . Hijacked by modern thugs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not really . When the airlock 's outer door opened , there must have been a catastrophic drop in pressure , but he froze solid so quickly his tissues did n't have time to rupture . There was no external sign of trauma whatever . He was n't forced into the lock . " " Of course he was n't , " I said impatiently . " He was lured in . Somebody said , " You go in first , I 'll be there in a minute , just go in and shut the door . Get yourself in the mood . When I 'm ready I 'll knock . " Tell me something - is the airlock often used for sex ? " She sighed . Polished off her milk . " The answer is yes . It 's hard to find privacy here - anybody 's cell can be opened at any time on the CM 's orders . So couples aiming at a quickie go into the airlock and push the button that seals the inner door . There 's enough air and warmth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've got in mind . Outside a warning light starts flashing , and when people see it they grin and chuckle . It 's an open secret , the kind that everybody knows and nobody talks about . " " How 's the outer door opened ? " " The control 's on the bulkhead just beyond the metal detector . It wo n't work until the inner door is sealed . Two people have to cooperate to open the airlock , one inside and one outside . The system 's intended as a fail-safe , to prevent accidents and suicides . " " A fail-safe that failed . " " Clearly . " Time for me to make my pitch . " Look , Sister . I 've gotten to trust you . And I need your help . " She smiled a little , folded her hands . She had hands like Anna 's , small but competent , clean blunt nails , no jewelry , no lacquer . I had the feeling she 'd been waiting for me to speak out . " Well , Colonel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll help any way I can . Could I first ask why you 've decided that I am , as the ancient Americans used to say , okay ? " " You were right from the beginning about the CM . I know that now . In fact , he 's even worse than you thought . " Briefly I filled her in about Kendo , about Ion , about the CM 's racket . She was n't as surprised as I expected she 'd be . Just listened carefully and nodded . " There 's a kind of in-group of dubious characters surrounding him , " she said . " The brothers and sisters call them the Pack . They are n't real monks , anybody can tell that . Trouble is , our robes and our rules of silence make anonymity so easy here , and monastic discipline makes questioning authority so hard . " " How many in the Pack ? " " Maybe a dozen in all . Ironically , poor Kendo was n't one of them . Maybe he was too nonviolent to be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give him a job in the treasurer 's office . " To my astonishment , her gray eyes filled with tears , the first I 'd seen her shed . " Sometimes I felt so sorry for him . Isolated among religious people whose viewpoint he could n't share and criminals who were so much worse than he was . " " Yeah , it 's too bad , " I muttered , not really meaning it , because I did n't care about Brother Kendo one way or the other . " Now , Sister , what I really need right now is - " She wiped the tears and started to say at the same time , " What I think you need right now is - " And we both finished together . " To meet the Master . " AS WE ENTERED Spoke Seven , she whispered the news that seeing Master Po would n't be easy for me . He was the CM 's prisoner , and had been for over a year . " He 's watched all the time . The CM used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Ion practically camped outside his door . A guard bot 's stationed inside the Master 's quarters , partly as his servant and partly as his keeper . It 's not armed , but it 's physically powerful and its command port has been sealed , so it ca n't be reprogrammed . " " How do you get in ? " " The CM wants Master Po alive for a while longer as a front for his schemes . So I 'm permitted to check on his health . As soon as I understood the situation , I became his ally and his channel to the outside . After the monitoring system went down , the Master and I began talking to each other in indirect language , quoting haiku with a word or two changed devices like that . Things the bot 's brain is too rigid to catch . " Things were starting to connect up . " Were you the one who disabled the monitoring system ? " " Yes . We could n't have the CM watching us . He 'd have understood in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cut the main optical cable . The whole thing 's so old - late twenty-first century - that I thought a breakdown would seem quite natural . But the CM 's paranoid , so he decided it must be part of a plot . And of course he was right . Well , you know , paranoid people have real enemies . " Spoke Seven contained the usual line of anonymous doorways . She paused at one , opened it quickly and checked inside . Then beckoned . " Wait here , " she whispered . " The Master 's cell is just across the corridor . He and I have a signal worked out . When I say " satori , " he 'll feign an attack - his blood pressure 's low , sometimes he goes into syncope and I 'll send the bot to fetch adrenaline . It 's programmed to respond to medical crises , so I think it 'll obey . The errand will only take it a few minutes , so you have to be in and out before it comes back . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him know he has a new ally . " The door slid shut . I was in a cell much like my own , except for the lack of civilian clothes and two clean habits hanging from hooks in the clothes rack , their hems clipped to a bar below to hold them straight . The desk had been turned into an altar , with statues of Jesus , Buddha , and the Goddess of Mercy . A picture of a many-armed smiling god had been taped to the bulkhead above and a teaspoonful of charred incense still smoked faintly in a covered burner . Whoever lived there had a Hindu background and thought that all embodiments of compassion were avatars of Vishnu . I was surprised he missed Mother Teresa who , I understood , had become a goddess with her own temple in New Calcutta . I put my ear to the door and listened . " Yes , it 's me , " said Sister Jann 's voice . She was speaking louder than usual to make sure I heard . A bot 's unmistakable flat tones answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it 's not the usual day .... No , no one came with me .... Well , if you think you heard an extra pair of footsteps , you 're wrong - " Atonal voice again . Goddamn bots anyway , you never knew how acute their sensory equipment was until too late . I barely had time to step between the white robes in the rack when the door opened . Smell of heated metal . It was a little guy , about a meter ten . It rolled on sticky tires into the room . Sounded like an irritated snake . I stepped out , hit the back of its " head " - the sensory center - with the edge of my right hand . The shock sent an aluminum plate flying and exposed a nest of glassy cables inside . I reached in and tore out a bunch . I did n't care what they did - they must have done something essential . The bot started off on one wheel , whirled , flipped over and started spinning around the deck . I slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jann was holding the door across the hall open and I slid into the Master 's quarters . " I have more than a few minutes now , " I told her . " What about the bot ? " " Forget the bot . " The Master , like Mmahat , lived in a suite . The main room was austere , with no chair , no desk , only tatami mats glued to the deck and a low Japanese table or two . On one wall hung a scroll with a black-andwhite Zen drawing of their prophet Bodhidharma , a ferocious-looking old gent with bulging eyes . A Japanese verse ran vertically beside the picture . " Do you read kanji ? " asked a creaking voice like a cricket 's song . " Sorry , no . " " It says , What 's the sound of one hand clapping ! Do you know what the koan means ? " The day before I 'd have said no , and gotten irritated to boot with what used to sound like gibberish . Today I said , " Possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beginning . Tea ? " Master Po looked like a cicada shell - small , elaborately wrinkled , dry and brown . His eyes twinkled like black diamonds . He sat on the deck cross-legged behind the Japanese table , and at his gesture I settled down facing him . Sister Jann brought cups covered with plastic , with straws inserted through nipples . " I do n't usually serve menfolk , " she explained . " But I make an exception for Masters and guys who fight bots and win . " We toasted each other with green tea while she and the Master exchanged amused glances . He treated her as an equal with whom he shared some sort of secret joke . " So you 've come up from Terra to examine our dirty laundry , " the Master said . His tiny , ancient voice scraped , squeaked , and whispered , but was perfectly clear . " Not my own doing , Master Po . Now , you wo n't have heard yet about the murder of so-called Brother Ion - " " So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've discovered Brother Aung Chai 's little game . " " Yes . " " He was my worst mistake , " sighed Master Po . " One of the Christian holy books warns against false prophets so sly they can deceive even the Chosen Ones . Well , I 'm not sure I 'm a Chosen One , but I know that he deceived me . What 's enlightenment but the discovery of our oneness with all beings ? Once confirmed in it , we pursue right action naturally , like Jesus when he discarded the laws and the prophets for his gospel of love . But what if someone went only halfway ? What if someone learned just enough to despise conventional morality without truly entering the enlightened state ? He 'd be a kind of walking cancer , you see , with no law and no love either . " " And that 's the Chief Monk . " The Master nodded . " His schemes do n't end with enriching himself . He means to leave the Order , return to Terra , and get himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous ass Mmahat . He 's got brains , forcefulness , a legion of rich supporters , an unearned reputation for being holy , and a genuinely mesmeric personality . So you see why we had to stop him . " " Shutting down his spy system was the first step , " said Sister Jann , taking up the tale . " Then we had to kill his enforcer . " " We ? " I gazed at the old gent , now well into his second century , and the serene-looking nun , over whose pale face a delicate blush was beginning to spread . " Well , I did at his command . It was very , very difficult for me to do . But for the sake of true religion we have to overthrow Aung Chai and restore the Master to rule and guide us . " I felt like a man who 'd just taken one of those banana-peel pratfalls you see in ancient comedies . Why did I think , in this of all places , that the motive had to be something practical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , with anger directly proportional to my embarrassment over my blunder . " Did you kill him , too ? " The delicate pink darkened to rose on her pale cheeks . " I made a mistake . A terrible mistake . I was quite anxious anyway , I 'd never tried to kill anybody before , and with the dim lights and so forth I thought I 'd spotted Brother Ion . But I got the wrong man . It was terribly distressing . " " Especially for Kendo . Poor guy , hiding from a measly fraud charge , and first he loses all his money and then he gets stabbed by a nun . Where 'd the knife come from ? " " It was a sample from a medical-supply outfit on Terra . It came in a miscellaneous shipment of new equipment and went through the scanners unnoticed . A disposable scalpel made of mirror duroplast , not steel , and sharp as an obsidian blade . After I ... used it , I dropped it into a waste-materials vent . We 've got kilometers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge amounts of energy . Well , mirror duroplast 's got a relatively low melting point , only 550 degrees , so the knife was gone forever . Of course I 'd worn gloves , and I threw them in , too . A tiny drop of blood got on the sleeve of my habit , but I was the one doing the neoluminol studies , so that did n't matter . " The Master waved a small , dry , clawlike hand . " Try not to be so conventional , Colonel . One death was a tragic accident , the other a wellmerited execution . What matters is that Aung Chai 's enforcer has been removed by Sister Jann . Now I understand you 've eliminated his bot as well . Next step : the man himself . " " Perhaps , " I murmured , " Sister Jann can lure him into the airlock , as she did Brother Ion . " She looked like I 'd slapped her . " Maybe I deserved that , " she whispered . " It was rather a vile thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of anything else . He was a professional killer , as you know , and after Kendo 's death he was on his guard . " " Did the fact that you 're a nun bother him ? " " I think it excited him , " she said slowly . " Like Nero wanting to rape a vestal virgin . And he was bored with his usual prey , these foolish females who are our guests . He not only pursued them himself , he pimped for the Chief Monk , who surely is Rasputin reborn . " Master Po raised his teacup , but suddenly halted the gesture and spoke out . " Enough talk ! We must purge Heaven 's Footstool and return it to right practice and the true path ! I order the Chief Monk to be deprived of the place he has dishonored . Arrest him , bind him , hold him for an open trial before all the brothers and sisters . " He sucked his tea down to the last drop . His hand descended and the cup rapped the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with exasperation and awe , thinking : A man who can put death and damnation into a teacup needs watching . " Aung Chai is no ordinary man , " the cricket voice resumed . " He 's as big as you are and several decades younger . He recognizes no law but his own ego . Like the tyrant Hitler in the ancient world , he possesses the demonic power of alienation - because he cares for nothing , he 's capable of anything . And he will be aided by the criminals he 's brought here , for their survival depends on his . " You must operate under difficult constraints . We have many friends among the brothers , who could make a good fight of it . Yet we ca n't afford a bloodbath . Nor can Aung Chai . For him it would be a political disaster . For us , it would shame the Order and make the White Monks infamous . The Chief Monk must be removed suddenly , as if struck by a thunderbolt . I ca n't compel you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you can carry out your obvious duty to eliminate a refuge for Terra 's felons . Once Aung Chai is gone , you can return home with a shuttlecraft full of scoundrels for whom there are outstanding warrants . You 'll be a hero down there . " I smiled a little ruefully . Nothing was working out as I expected . First I got the wrong man in my sights . Then I found out that my ally , the good sister , did the killing . Now I was being invited to lead a coup d ' tat for the sake of true religion . And it looked like I 'd have to . That nest of felons did need cleaning out , and this was the only way to do it . Master Po was a hundred and twenty-eight , and on Earth would have weighed maybe fifty kilos , but he had me in the mental equivalent of a headlock . " Master , " I asked , " in your younger days , did you practice judo ? " " Yes , and was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own size . " " That 's easy to be - " But I did n't have time to get out " believe . " The door slid open behind me and I turned to find the gap overfilled by the Reverend Aung Chai , with four chunky spooks behind him . " So there 's a transmitter in the bot , " I remarked , " and it sounded a silent alarm . " He and his friends entered the room , pushing back their hoods , Regulation 19 or no Regulation 19 . With a sinking sensation I recognized three of his spooks from times and crimes past . Killers , armed robbers , brutes . Speaking religiously , an Unholy Trinity-and I felt sure the fourth was no better than the ones I knew . A few minutes later I was sitting on the deck , back against a bulkhead , ankles tied together , knees under my chin , wrists tied behind me - the only one they bothered to tie up , which I suppose was a compliment of sorts . Sister Jann sat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the meditation position , hands against his hara , back ramrod straight , face composed and eyes cast down . He seemed to be ignoring the enemy whose career he launched and now had failed to stop . My omni reposed in the CM 's left sleeve , where it continued to pick up our voices and the messages emanating silently from the chip in my larynx . The CM was not a generous winner . " For you , the airlock , " he told me . " Later , when our honored guests are asleep . You 're nothing but a retired cop with a blot on your record , so I do n't imagine the accident will cause much stink on Terra . " He smiled at Sister Jann , exposing his long teeth . She 'd been his nemesis , and he acted accordingly . " She 's yours , " he told one of his followers , a short thick individual with a scar-seamed dark face and arms longer than his legs . His name floated across my mind - Sirathan Radhakrishnan , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself quite a career in the international settlement at New Angkor , killing for pay and disposing of the bodies in the fish farms that dot the big lake of the Tonle Sap . He 'd been missing three or four years . Now he grinned , bent down , grabbed Sister Jann and swung her over his shoulder with one smooth motion . He 'd had a lot of practice moving bodies , though not live ones . Sirathan stepped into the Master 's bedroom and the door slid shut behind him . I asked Aung Chai , " Did you have to do that ? " " Yes . I want her to suffer , and if I know the gentleman she 's with , she will . " He gave me his ferocious smile . I try not to act in anger , you do dumb things that way , but at this point I just let go . What did I have to lose , anyway ? In standard gravity I 'd have had a hard time moving . As it was , I pushed down hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me halfway to my feet . Another hard kick pulled my stickums off the deck and sent me into a graceful arc , like a slow rocket , against the Chief Monk 's face and chest . I had only one available weapon , so I used it , I got my teeth into his throat and bit down on the windpipe as hard as I could , trying to strangle him . Christ , it was like getting a mouthful of brambles . He made a gargling noise . Hands grabbed at me , trying to pull me off while I made like a bulldog , now tasting the salt in his goddamn blood . Then a heavy fist thumped the back of my neck and I saw stars and flashes . They yanked up on my bound hands and pain shot up through my shoulders and when I gasped they pulled me loose from the CM . I twisted and turned like a gaffed eel in midair , folded up my legs and kicked as hard as I could . My feet sank into somebody 's gut , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack , or maybe two bones . There was yelling and curses as I broke loose and launched myself off a bulkhead at the CM and hit him in the belly with my hard , hard head . This time he was knocked loose from the deck and caromed off another bulkhead and came back at me . His neck was bleeding , his thumbs were extended , he wanted my eyes , and when the others grabbed my arms again I was beginning to think he 'd get them . Then Master Po hurled his frail body against Aung Chai . Did no damage , but deflected him for a few seconds , during which one of my captors screamed , doubled up , turned me loose and made a slow , elegant somersault while droplets of bright arterial blood sprayed , spread , and drifted in midair . That 's when I realized that Sister Jann had joined the melee . She was holding something like a gleaming shard of mirror . She clutched my hand and ducked behind my back and I felt the blade slide through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendons of a chicken . She stabbed another of my assailants in a motion so practiced and quick the gleaming blade vanished and reappeared almost in the same instant , only not as bright as before . I went for the CM once again , this time with hands free and with lethal intent . But my feet were still tied and we fell all in a heap together , not against the deck but against a bulkhead - so far we 'd bounced off all four-then up against the ceiling . But he 'd had enough , he pushed me off , and he and his remaining bully tumbled through the doorway and disappeared . This strange underwater ballet of a brawl was over . Sister Jann and I were left bobbing around the room like corks , along with two bodies , one groaning , one not ; As we reconnected with the deck , Master Po began clapping his ancient hands . " How splendid ! " he exclaimed . " How splendid ! " I bent down and freed my feet . Recovered my omni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was floating in midair . I was still trying to get my breath ; the CM 's pals had almost dislocated my shoulders and I felt pretty battered . I foresaw a painful awakening next morning , but at least I would awaken . I pointed at Sister Jann 's knife and gasped , " So there were two samples in that shipment ? " Apologetically she smiled . " Yes . I hid this one inside Brother Kendo 's body when I was doing his autopsy . After the search was over , I recovered it . Given the situation , I thought I 'd better go armed . " She used her sleeve to wipe the CM 's loathsome blood off my face . I had to grin . This was not a lady I 'd ever think about romantically , even if she were so inclined . But as an ally she was worth her weight in something a good deal more valuable than gold . I reflected that virgins in ancient myth were often pretty ferocious , like Athena and Brunnhilde , filled with magical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . " Where 's the would-be rapist ? " I inquired when she 'd cleaned me up a bit . She sighed , saddened by the things she 'd had to do . " In the bedroom . I left him spinning in an eddy of red fog . What a fool , throwing me over his shoulder that way . I had the knife in my left sleeve and when the bedroom door shut I pulled it , twisted around and slashed his carotid artery . To think I 'm a doctor and a nun , and here I 've killed four men . " She glanced at the body that was groaning , but had now stopped . " Maybe five . " " Do n't fall into the absurdity of regretting necessary actions , " piped up Master Po . " There 's still much work to be done . And it will be dangerous work . " " More dangerous than this ? " I asked , gesturing at the casualties . " Possibly . He underestimated us before . He wo n't again . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then we 'd better be going . " I picked up Master Po . In this near-weightless world , with only an occasional gentle nudge he floated , the mythical Levitating Master come to life . All I really had to do was steer him . We hastened into the corridor , and the door whispered shut behind us . WE DID N'T KNOW where the Chief Monk was , or what he was doing , but we could all guess without any trouble . He was in his lair , summoning whatever remained of his gang . They would wait for lights-out tonight and come hunting us , scouring the rings and spokes one by one . We needed help , needed it quick , and I did n't have to think twice to know where to find it . We hustled on down to B Ring where the Honored Guests resided , and I knocked on Death 's door ( ! ) . Gladiator Rhee , otherwise known as Huksa Byung , opened up , stared in astonishment at the floating Master , then invited us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , " piped up Master Po , " we come to ask you for aid , and may joy and good fortune light upon you and your house if you give it to us . " " For you , Master , anything , " he said . " But what - ? " Briefly I put him in the picture . A simplified version , of course : the Chief Monk had turned traitor and wanted to kill the Master in order to take his place . Black Death showed no surprise at hearing this . " Sounds like home , " he nodded . " In the whole history of Korea , whenever we were n't being invaded by foreigners , we were having palace revolts . I pray , " he added to the Master , " that you will enroll me under your banner . " " With pleasure . And now , " he said , " may I visit your bathroom , Honored Champion Rhee ? I 've drunk a great deal of tea , and the bladders of the very old are notoriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappear , I asked our new ally what usually happened to palace rebels in old Korea . " If a rebel won , he became emperor . If he lost , he perished by the Slow Death . " " Which meant ? " " They started at the tip of his left little finger , and shortened him by one joint every day . " " Olden days , golden days . " Master Po returned , smiling blissfully . " I used to preach a sermon on the religious significance of urination , " he said . " As with all of life , one must learn some conscious control , but ultimately one must yield to nature , and it 's in the yielding that one finds pleasure and relief . Now , if you young people will hear an old man 's advice , I have a few ideas to suggest . While I was a prisoner I had plenty of time to think , you see . " Briefly the old gent outlined his plan , which began with seizing the Hub and getting control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " All the years of my life I 've underestimated sainthood . " " I 'm not a saint . I belong to a different tradition , which honors the sage . The saint tries to rise above nature . The sage tries only to embody it . " " The sage too is without pity , " I quoted . " He burns the families of men like straw dogs . " " But only when it 's necessary , " he pointed out . " Our real mission is to save , but everywhere positive and negative are so closely interwoven that sometimes we must destroy in order to save . Shall we go ? " " Stay here , " Black Death commanded Sister Jann . " They 're all afraid of me . You 'll be safe in my quarters . " " No , no , " murmured the Master . " She goes with us . " He looked a bit baffled by that . " Surely Sister is n't a warrior ? " " You might be surprised , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Soft weakness overcomes hard strength . This is called the Dark Illumination . " " You see , " said Po dryly , " he has a quote for everything . One of these days he may begin to speak for himself . " We let the door close behind us . The spoke was empty ; somewhere I heard faint sounds of chanting , but that was all . We set off accompanied by the patter , patter of our sticky boots . I was curious about how we were supposed to carry out the first phase of the plan . " When you sabotaged the monitors , " I asked Sister , " how 'd you get into the Hub ? " " Could n't . The lock 's an antique with a sensor that reads fingerprints , if you can believe that . Antique but , I might add , very effective . A year or two back they hired an expert from a museum of technology , who set it to recognize only the CM and Brother Ion . And you have to be inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside to get inside . " " Then how - " " It was easy enough . I came down here in the middle of the night . A Ring 's separated from the Hub only by a circular corridor . I started unbolting wall panels until I found where the main cable comes out . " " So how do we get in now ? " " Think it over , Colonel . I 'm sure you 'll realize there 's an easy way oh , oh . " We heard an unmistakable bass voice , and it was n't chanting Aum . We crowded into a handy cell . Somebody with a Jewish background lived here - I recognized the nine-branched Hannukah menorah . Surrounded by all these symbols of faith , I wondered if I 'd missed something critical in human life by coming from a family that had n't been observant for a couple of hundred years . Well , no time for that now . Somebody , two somebodies , no three , no four , were shuffling past . Aung Chai was trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his bass-fiddle tones made our teeth vibrate . I had no trouble detecting the word Hub . Sister Jann caught my eye and shrugged . " He 's very bright , you know , " she whispered . Damn true . He 'd realized the importance of the Hub and he did n't want to trust entirely to the lock . Wondering how many guards he 'd assign there , and where they 'd be posted , I dropped to my knees , opened the door a crack , and got one eye looking down the spoke to the corridor that circles the Hub . One guard there . No , two . And here was another complication . The first guard was carrying a long-barreled pistol , a four-point-nine impact weapon , to be precise . So it was no more Mr. Nice Guy . The CM had broken out the hardware . Now I saw why he banned weapons - so he could monopolize them . The second guard was idly slamming one fist into another . Cracking sound . Making sure his brass knucks were comfy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled to each other , then slouched off together , out of my line of vision . Briefly I paused to do some arithmetic . If Sister Jann was right about Aung Chai having a dozen criminals in his Pack , and if she 'd killed five - five ! I still could n't quite believe it - and if three were assigned to the Hub , that left the CM and no more than four others to form the search party after lights-out . Our forces consisted of one aging cop , one gladiator , one lady with a blade , and one **33;3709;TOOLONG with a lion 's heart and a dead cicada 's body . I pulled back inside , let the door close . " Master , " I said humbly , " this will take strategy . I ask your advice . " Which he proceeded to give , concisely . " So it 'll be you , me , and Huksa Byung ? " " Yes . But Sister Jann will accompany you to the kitchen , for she has a duty , too . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meditation is approaching . The CM has to preside or everybody will know something 's seriously wrong . But he 'll make the ceremony as brief as possible . The evening meal 's always a snack , and he may well advance the usual hour of lights out on some excuse or other . Once the monks and guests are in their cells , the hunt will begin . Meantime we have our window of opportunity . " I checked the empty corridor again , slipped out with Sister Jann following . This close to the Hub the spokes were close together and we took only a few seconds to cross to the next one . Glanced down it , saw nobody , hurried to the kitchen and slipped inside . Empty and sterile ; stillness of polished metal , ceramic tiles on bulkheads and deck , well-scrubbed sinks and a long , antique hotspot range scoured clean as a Zen temple . Leftovers for the evening meal laid out in covered dishes , each held down by a magnet in the base . While she hastened to the freezer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded the Hub . Heard the low tearing-paper sounds of stickums on the carpeting as the guards approached , completing their circuit . The curvature meant they could only see a bit of the corridor at any one time . Mr. Death now was giving Master Po a gentle shove and stepping back out of their Une of vision . Meantime I waited , hoping I would n't hear the short dry cough that is the only sound an impact pistol makes . " What the hell ? " somebody said , and I stepped out behind the guards , who were staring dumbfounded at the Master floating toward them in midair , palms pressed together , eyes cast down , looking as if he traveled like this all the time . I lunged , hoping to chop the guy with the pistol at the base of the neck , but he heard my stickums and whirled around . So instead I whacked him on the inside of the elbow , aiming for the ulnar nerve . The gun went flying and he jabbed at my throat with his left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with my shoulder . His boots popped free of the deck and he flew backward and bumped his pal 's back . The second goon turned , and he was n't wearing brass knucks , he had a cestus on his right hand . It was equipment for the really nasty Absolute Combat bouts , the closed-circuit snuff shows where the sole aim was maximum butchery and blood . The Romans made cesti out of leather , but this one was the ubiquitous duroplast with studs designed to mutilate . The gun had floated out of reach , so I assumed the position for combat . Then shrugged and turned my back . Unseen by either thug , Mr. Death had arrived on the scene . Like a true gladiator , he gave fair warning . " Guard yourself , " he said . I took maybe half a minute catching the gun , pressing the recognition stud , and waiting for it to learn the pattern of micro-bloodvessels in my thumb . ( Otherwise it would n't fire . ) So I did n't see what happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cestus was down , with Black Death 's foot on his chest , and the first guy was trying to get away , scrabbling his way along the ceiling like an escaping cockroach . I felt embarrassed to shoot him in flight , but that did n't stop me from touching the firing stud . The bullet exploded inside him , he popped like a tick , and drifted on slowly , leaving a crimson jet trail behind . The champ looked around , as if expecting a referee to declare the match over . Then removed his foot and touched the body of his late adversary gently with the toe of his boot . " Ah well , " he sighed . " Another tablet for the temple . " I noticed that the guy who 'd had the gun did n't qualify for the brotherhood of warriors . I knew him , by the way - another killer in the CM 's remarkable collection . So this too was what the Master called a well-merited execution , not that I cared a great deal whether it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlefield when Sister Jann reappeared . She was guiding the Master back to us with one hand , while carrying a gray object in the other . " Ready ? " she asked , and without waiting for an answer she shoved Brother Ion 's severed right hand into the sensor and the door to the Hub purred open . The first firefight of the season followed . We heard two short coughs inside and two impact rounds exploded against the corridor 's outer bulkhead . You do n't think much under those circumstances , so I shoved my weapon around the jamb and tapped the firing stud three times , producing sounds of disintegration , human and mechanical . Somewhere a shrill alarm bell began ringing . I edged one eye into the opening , and yes , I got the third guard , but also some equipment I hoped was n't absolutely essential to our survival . Entered cautiously , leading the way , wondering if a fourth killer could be hidden somewhere . But this was the command center , all controls and dials laid out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened you saw the whole inside . The door closed automatically behind us , shutting off the noise of the alarm bell . Sister Jann approached the dead body , but she was n't looking at it - in fact , looking at it would n't have yielded much information , since one of my rounds happened to hit the face . She was staring instead at the damage done by my second and third shots to the console behind the body . One had torn a big hole . The next had gone straight through into a complicated maze of printed circuits . I began to get a sinking feeling , confirmed when Sister Jann murmured inadequately , " Oh , dear . " " What 'd I do ? " " I 'm no engineer , but judging by what 's left of these dials , I rather think you 've wrecked the temperature regulating system . With the solar panels continuing to pour in power , this station 's going to have what amounts to a heat stroke . " She moved down a row of undamaged dials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ah . It 's slightly elevated already , about a tenth of a degree . I 'd guess that within a day the heat buildup will reach uncomfortable levels . Then rapidly become unbearable . Eventually all the circuitry will fry , including the computers that maintain the station 's attitude and keep it in a stable orbit . Then Heaven 's Footstool will start to wobble , the orbit will decay , and - " " I think , " piped up Master Po , " that we had better conclude our business here sooner rather than later . " We tumbled into the corridor , scooted up the nearest spoke and popped into an empty cell . It belonged to the guy with the images of compassion . We were barely in time . Voices muttered in the ring we 'd just left , including that unmistakable bass . Responding to the alarm , they were finding the corpses , the wreckage . A scream rose , a horrible long-drawn-out scream not of fear but of pure rage - the scream of a dying puma that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I edged into the spoke again , every sense straining , followed by our gladiator . One thug stood outside the door to the Hub , gun in hand . The others must have gone inside to view the catastrophe . I checked the little window on the back of my own weapon to see how many shots I had left . Exactly one , and if I missed - Then Black Death intervened . With the speed only a pro can manage , he fell and rolled into the corridor . The guard whirled around and his gun coughed , but now the Champ was taking advantage of the curvature , he was out of sight and the guard - who could n't have caught more than a glimpse of somebody in motion-went after him . His mistake . By the time Black Death returned , I 'd discarded my empty weapon and was pressing the recognition stud on the guard 's . Softly it beeped at me , and then I used it to destroy the sensor on the door to the Hub . Was there a manual override @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I figured to give him a greeting he would n't forget . The door remained shut , though we heard muffled thumping against the inside . Sister Jann and the Master joined us . A Ring looked like the last act of Hamlet , except that the bodies were floating instead of lying around in heaps/Incidentally , the pseudograv was n't totally dead , because over time the bodies drifted very slowly downward , like drowned mariners in a very salty sea . Droplets of their blood formed perfect , glistening spheres and for some reason seemed to follow the men they once helped to animate , like the tails of comets . I said , " I 'll stay on guard here , just to make sure nobody escapes . You go ahead , and - " " Oh no , " said Master Po , positively , shaking his head . " No , no . Our brother , Honored Champion Rhee , will do the guard duty . From you , Honored Colonel , I still have one final favor to ask . " I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that explained everything , " You see , it 's the hour of the Great Meditation . They 're waiting for the CM and me , all the monks , the real monks I mean . The nuns . The guests . And we must not disappoint them . " So it happened that a few minutes after the slaughter , I entered the amphitheater with Master Po on my arm . My white robe enfolded me , the hood hid my face . I deposited him on his throne and sat down at his feet . He cleared his throat and in that dry , crisp little cricket voice that somehow reached the back of the hall with perfect clarity , made his announcement . " Brothers and sisters , honored guests , I have sad news to communicate to you . I 'm sure you 've heard an alarm bell ringing and an outcry of grief . As you know , Heaven 's Footstool is very old , as orbital stations go . When I was born , it had already been serving humankind for almost a hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last decaying . Soon this station must plunge into the atmosphere and be consumed . " Instead of grieving further , let us be grateful in our hearts that we have had this exceptional place so long . When the shuttle arrives tomorrow , our honored guests will be the first to board , then the brothers and sisters . The Chief Monk and I will go last of all . That is as it should be . " Now I call upon the Chief Monk to lead us for our last devotions in Heaven 's Footstool . " The lights vanished . Again we were in the primal darkness from which being somehow distills itself - either spontaneously , wu-wei , as the scientists and the Taoists claim , or at the word of some sort of EverLiving One , as the various faiths begotten by my people avow . Deepening my voice , trying for the orotund periods of the Reverend Aung Chai , I declared : " Thus , my brothers and sisters , do all things begin . This is the original state , the abyss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinity . And then the light appears . " In Manypalms Oasis , I spent the first night back beside my wife Anna , hoping never to rest anywhere else until I rested for good . I even welcomed the burden of my own recovered weight , pressing me down , nailing me to the bed . We got up early , because there was a sight we wanted to see . While showering - my own shower , no vacuum plumbing , water plunging downward the way it was supposed to - I decided to write this narrative . Yeah , I turned in the customary formal report to HQ , with numbered paragraphs , all the customary bureaucratic boilerplate . But it was full of uncomfortable truths , and by the time it sees light outside the security Forces , I know goddamn well it will have been transformed into something rich and strange . HQ is n't about to admit publicly that some of its own people were up to their armpits in the CM 's racket . By contrast , this account is taken direct from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the times when I made a fool of myself . I intend to file it , along with the memory cube , someplace safe - not in the archives of the security Forces . After a gulp of coffee , Anna and I set out walking along the edge of the desert , holding hands like young lovers . The sun had n't yet appeared . The sky was a perfect pale fluorescent blue , the coming day a fiery serpent along the horizon 's rim . The bulk of the Mountain Lion reared up to our right ; cacti spotted the barrenness , otherworldly shapes that ranged from bristling spheres to long , thin Giacometti sculptures . That was when she chose to ask a question she 'd carefully avoided until I 'd had a chance to rest and unwind . " Was the last night in orbit pretty bad ? " she wanted to know . " When I first saw you I thought , oh great Tao , he looks like he 's been through another Planet Bela . " I took a deep breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only then try to recover . " It was bad , " I admitted . " Not like Bela , but bad enough . The heat built up faster than we expected . When it hit 36C , everybody was outside their cells , shuffling through the halls , trying to get a breath . Robes were too damn hot , people were half naked , wrapping themselves in wet towels . The bulkheads got hot , the deck got hot , the ceiling got hottest of all . Our prisoners in the Hub turned out all the lights , or maybe they just burned out - good thing they could n't shut off our air supply too , without shutting off their own . " Emergency lights came on . When the decks got too hot , people took off their stickums and floated in the red dimness like ghosts trailing their shrouds . Councilor Mmahat started having hysterics , so I punched him out . That was satisfying , but really I was just as scared as he was , only hiding it better . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll all be steamed like rice . " She shivered . The desert was cold in the morning , but that was n't the reason . She put an arm around my waist , hand pressing my haia , holding me down to Mother Earth . I told her about the finish . How the supply shuttle arrived on the dot and locked onto Heaven 's Footstool . How Sister Jann and I worked the airlock together until the seals hissed open . People jostled forward , only to meet the shuttle captain , who was armed and going the other way . I told him to jettison his cargo , because over a hundred people had to be jammed into the shuttle somehow . He refused , the perfect bureaucrat , because he was responsible for the cargo until it was signed for . So Master Po signed the manifest in kanji , which nobody else could read , and only then would the captain agree to dump the cargo so the rescue could proceed . The guests surged through the lock , Mmahat supported by his handmaiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her master . The monks followed . Last act . Everybody was aboard the shuttle except Black Death and me . He trotted up from A Ring , wearing only a loincloth and his stickums , panting like a dog and sweating rivers . His whole torso was covered with a spiderweb of fine white scars . He told me that our prisoners got the door to the Hub open somehow , and he had to shoot two more of them . " Aung Chai ? " I asked . " Still inside , I guess . The leader did n't lead . Or he led from the rear . " His grin gave me a flash of gold . " Come aboard , Honored Champion Rhee . " I was following him , the last rat leaving the falling star , when guess who came running in from D Ring ? The CM was wild-eyed and wringing wet , and waving a pistol . He spotted me standing just inside the shuttle 's loading port and the shuttle 's door closing . He knew we 'd cut loose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble of air in Heaven 's Footstool would rush howling into the void , blowing him with it . " I 'll die ! " he shouted . " I 'll die ! " " The great weakness of the demonic personality , " piped up Master Po 's voice at my elbow , " is that it believes in nothing but its own ego . Then how can it face death and the disintegration of the ego ? " Well , I know how the CM faced it . He did n't . After all , I insulted pumas by comparing him to them . He did n't die like a lion . Instead of pumping shots at us in a final gesture of defiance , he ran to the control for the outer door of the airlock and pressed it . It began closing , sealing him inside alive and saving him for an infinitely worse death than being quick-frozen and blown into space . He was willing to be roasted alive in order to live another few minutes , a few hours at most . As some theologians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he makes it for himself . Meantime the nuclear steel door of the shuttle 's port closed with a hiss , clamps clanged loose from the flanges of the airlock , and we began to drift away from Orbital Station One , which had been so many things , a place of learning , a place of prayer , and now had one last role to play a burning tomb . " What happened to Master Po ? " Anna wanted to know . " Earth 's gravity got him . Or maybe post-traumatic stress . He 'd been through a lot , you know . His heart action was weak anyway , and shortly after we landed he passed out - went into syncope , as you medical types say . Sister Jann tried to revive him , but could n't . I think that devastated her more than anything else . Afterward , she told me she 's leaving the White Monks to join the Mother Teresa Guild and spend the rest of her life caring for the dying . " " She does have a tropism for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Curious .... On a more practical note , what about your pension ? " " I would n't start spending the extra money yet . You 've seen the news coverage . They 're calling me Colonel Albatross because I always seem to be present at disasters . Councilor Mmahat 's promoting a temple at New Angkor dedicated to his pal Aung Chai . By the time the official historians get finished , the CM will be the heroic captain who went down with his ship , and I 'll just be the dumb cop who destroyed Heaven 's Footstool . After all , that 's what I did . " " No , you did n't , " she said . She stamped her size-4 foot on the dusty ground . " This is Heaven 's Footstool . The real one . And always has been . " She 'd told a truth worthy of Lao-tzu . Also she was telling me never to leave it again . I nodded agreement , but then went back to gawking at the sky , as usual . The reason we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night 's news . " Look , " I told her . " Here it comes . Last orbit . " A meteor came flashing out of the dark west . It passed over us toward the fiery east in a long , elegant arc that ended in nothing . Or in Everything - take your pick .
