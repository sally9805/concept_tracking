Chapter One : Glamour Girls At the beginning of my movie , before the lights come up , you 'll hear music . The audience will be primed for adventure-viewing because of the soundtrack , which will be provided mostly by folk-punk girl bands with names like " Eleanor 's Sister " or " Tubercular Purr . " Lights out . A single guitar starts fast but low . Drums come in , sounding like they 're being scratched with kitchen utensils . Bass picks up the beat , subsiding into the undercurrent . The music picks up speed with the crescendo , then plateaus when the singer comes in . Her voice is full of gravel and makes you want to reach down into her throat and pull up her voice to figure out how it works , or to swallow it yourself . The dark screen begins to fade into image as the music rises . There 's a round yellowish girl with dark hair driving a beat-up blue pickup truck with some rust around the fenders . That 's me . The red clay kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . You do n't know yet whether I am going away from or toward something , but I guess I 'm doing both . Maybe I just robbed a convenience store , or witnessed a murder . Maybe I 'm going to join the circus to avoid a rotten uncle . No one knows at the beginning because you just see me driving . And I look so cool , with my cat-eye sunglasses on . All the colors will be intense : bright yellow sun glinting off the dried raindrops crusted to the truck 's dusty windows , saturated red dirt road , deep azure sky . It looks like a late summer afternoon ; the trees have patches of lime green leaves and that curious golden quality to them that you only get on humiddays . A cloud of dust obscures the view for a moment , then pan to a huge brick house . A silhouette of someone blocking the sun stands at the edge of a manicured bright green lawn , waiting for me to pick her up . She tosses her bag into the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life does n't seem to be quite as cinematic . " You 're wearing that ? " Kenney arches one of her meticulously plucked eyebrows at me . I look down at my plaid sneakers and worn-out jean shorts . " What ? " My best friend : the nine-foot-tall toothpick with hair like fire . Of course she ca n't see the glory of my broken-in socks and comfortably relaxed yellow T-shirt . To her , these items are odious because there is no glamour involved . When she puts together an outfit , she chooses it based on its impact on the Richter scale . Today , when she pulled up in front of my house in her Mary Kay pink vintage Mustang convertible , she made sure to toss her head just so as the boy watering the Johnson yard gaped at her lanky arms and long legs unfolding from her tiger-striped plush bucket seats . And now she 's standing in front of me wearing a knee-length red and white hounds ' tooth skirt with a clingy bright red shirt , and pulling polyester printed items out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Kenney can wear red with red hair and not look like tomato soup . As for me , I am convinced she keeps me around for my kooky-best-friend sidekick quality . " Come on , Aurin , we can always do better . " She puts her arm around my shoulders and guides me toward the bathroom so I can change . " Well , where are we going ? " I ask as she shuts the door behind me and makes herself comfortable rummaging through my room . " To the park to meet Fred . " " Big deal . " I pull on the beige button-down dress with robin 's egg blue flowers that she 'd shoved at me . " What if we see somebody ? " Kenney asks . " You 've always got to consider running into people . " I open the door and roll my eyes . " I do n't see why I need to think about that . It is n't as if I 'm ever going to have more than two friends anyway . " " We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you want to reinvent yourself ? We 're not going to be in high school forever , you know . This is your time to be foxy . Use it well . " " Girl crap , " I mutter . " And what 's with that hair-do , lady ? " Kenney grimaces . " Who wears hankies on their head anymore ? " She pulls the bandanna off of my head . " I was just trying to get my hair out of my face . " " We can always do better . " Her refrain . She grabs a bottle out of her purse and starts squirting my hair and crunching it into clumps . She digs through her bag some more , then starts poking bobby pins into my hair , styling it into a more organized mess . Her hair , of course , is perfectly styled to match the ' 40s look she 's been cultivating lately . Apparently she thinks we both need to fit into her old movie image , create total illusion . She does n't appreciate the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know who I 'm supposed to be trying to impress anyway . Kenney rifles through my closet , " Here . " She shoves a pair of old-lady shoes at me , the ones with a thick , short heel and square toe that I got for fifty cents and painted brown . She pauses and looks at me while I put on the shoes . I shift my legs , scratching my knees against one another . Kenney is still considering the outcome of her fashion restructuring . A smile slides onto her face . " Now , Aurin , that is so much better ! Just see how nice you look . Why do n't you ever wear this ? " She tugs at the corner of the dress , straightening the hemline . " It 's hot and itchy ? " I offer . Kenney glances at my watch  --  she never wears one . " It 's getting late , we better go . " That 's settled . And here we go to the park to meet Fred .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
