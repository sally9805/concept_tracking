<p> Pat Riley does n't seem worried , even after a 99-85 loss Sunday night to the Dallas Mavericks left his Miami Heat down by two games in the NBA Finals . Never mind that superstar center Shaquille O'Neal scored a mere five points or the mounting evidence that Riley was outcoached by rookie counterpart Avery Johnson in the double-digit losses . Riley did not require his team to show up for work Monday . He gave players a day of rest at home . <p> With still slicked-back hair that is grayer and thinner than during the glory days of his youth with the Los Angeles Lakers , and an occasional limp that hints at the hip replacement surgery he has been putting off , Riley , 61 , brings more humanity to the sideline these days . Once known for his drill-sergeant mentality , super-cool image and sense of self-importance , Riley now strives not to overwork or overwhelm his veteran team even when it exasperates him . <p> " It 's a combination of the personnel we have , and it 's also a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " Riley said . " People like to use the word ' mellowed . ' It 's not about that . I think it 's being smarter , a lot less desperate , more thorough and also understanding the guys that I have here are veterans , smart guys who want to win . " <p> This team surely wants to win , but it brought its baffling inconsistency into the playoffs . Miami , which performed poorly against the league 's best teams during the regular season , has endured horrendous outings in every round of the playoffs , and Riley has been unable to stifle the problems . O'Neal and fellow veterans Antoine Walker , Gary Payton , Jason Williams and James Posey  --  all added by Riley as he overhauled the roster last summer  --  did n't seem overly concerned with the ups and downs of the regular season , during which the Heat won fewer games than last year 's Stan Van Gundy-led Eastern Conference finalists , but Miami is running out of chances to dig itself out of holes after the disastrous start against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know when it matters the most , " Riley said . " That 's something I do n't like , but you have to manage it . " <p> Despite his softer exterior , many characterized Riley 's return as nothing short of a hostile takeover by a Hall of Fame coach itching to get back to the bench . Heat owner Micky Arison , however , disputed that notion . He said he was frustrated that the Heat 's Dec. 12 news conference announcing Riley 's move from team president to coach was greeted with skepticism and even ridicule by those who believed Van Gundy took a fall to accommodate his longtime mentor . <p> " I care , " Arison said during a recent telephone interview . " I think after 30 years of business in Miami . . . I would think I would have built some credibility . I would n't flagrantly lie about something like that . " <p> Arison says now that after a November home game a couple of weeks into the season , Riley approached Arison as he stood among players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , a private area in the depths of American Airlines Arena . Riley , Arison recalled , handed him an envelope and told him not to open it until he had left for the night . <p> Puzzled and curious , Arison said he followed the instructions . After departing from the arena , he pulled out a hand-written , multi-page letter from Van Gundy , then the team 's second-year coach . <p> " It was a letter of resignation , " Arison said . " It was very detailed as to why he did n't want to coach . " The letter , which described Van Gundy 's desire to travel less and spend more time with his wife and four children , led to Riley 's return to the sidelines in mid-December after a 21/2-year absence . <p> Riley twice talked Arison out of accepting the resignation letter and urged a waiting period  --  during which he and Riley each met privately with Van Gundy  --  to allow Van Gundy time to reconsider , according to Arison . And it was Arison , not Riley , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a one-hour meeting with Arison that he would be happy to do anything for the Heat that did not involve extensive travel or television duties , Arison recalled . <p> " It 's too demanding a job to ask a guy who does n't want to do it to do it , " Arison said . " We had a one-hour meeting . He laid out for me why he did n't want to continue to coach . He said he had started thinking about it the prior season . . . . Five weeks later we were around .500 and I was feeling very uncomfortable . I felt I had a coach who did n't want to coach . " <p> Arison said Riley told him Van Gundy first indicated he wished to step down after a preseason game . Asked whether Van Gundy included pressure from Riley among his reasons for wanting to depart , Arison said , " No . " <p> Riley said last summer he , at times , yearned to get back into coaching , and in June , he vowed to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a blizzard of speculation that he was plotting a takeover . A month later , he tried to quash  --  some said belatedly and insufficiently  --  rumors that Van Gundy 's days as coach were numbered . But Riley said last week those who suggested he forced or nudged out Van Gundy are " calling Stan a liar . I 'm not going to go back and try to defend anything . I spent six weeks trying to talk him out of leaving , but he wanted to get out . " <p> Arison said Van Gundy was not paid the entirety of his 2005-2006 coaching contract , standard practice when a coach does not leave voluntarily . <p> The Heat declined to allow Van Gundy  --  who is still officially employed by Miami  --  to comment , citing a team policy of allowing only Riley or Heat General Manager Randy Pfund to talk to the media . Van Gundy , reached at his home , said he would only do an interview if approval were granted . At the December news conference , he said , " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once Van Gundy 's resignation was accepted , Arison said , there was little doubt Riley would coach again . <p> " I 'm sitting across from one of the best basketball coaches in history . . . . It seemed very logical to me that he would choose himself , " Arison said . " Of course , it was his decision to do that . I think it was overwhelmingly obvious to him , too . " <p> Riley returned to the sidelines in Chicago Dec. 13 . The transition from the front office , he said , proved difficult in part because he did not know the team 's playbook and did n't readily absorb Van Gundy 's terminology . He described himself as a " sequential thinker " thrown off rhythm by the differences in his protege 's style . <p> " I was not comfortable at all , " Riley said . " In the beginning , I was going by instinct and gut . I had an extremely difficult time . " <p> So did his team . Riley , meantime , seemed relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences with self-deprecating references . <p> He has called himself an " old codger . " He dismisses the notion that he is laboring harder than ever , describing his 4 a.m. wake-ups this season as a product not of workload but of " old age or insomnia . " In response to a question about his nearly four decades in the league , he quipped , " you mean my Botox is n't working ? " <p> " It 's a little different at this age than when I was mindlessly ambitious and nothing got in the way , " Riley said , adding during later interviews , " I was a young , ambitious coach trying to make it , really make it . It 's a whole different thing since I 've been in Miami for 11 years . . . . You change over the years and thank God I have . I think I 'm a much better person today than I was back in the ' 80s . " <p> How Riley steers his team through this latest quagmire likely will define his return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court and has been liberal in allowing days off for the aged and aching . He was not shy about asking O'Neal to shed about 35 pounds with a sensible diet this season but , even so , O'Neal said , Riley has been more father figure than task master . <p> " I heard a lot of bad stories about him , " O'Neal said . " I have n't seen it . The thing I like about him is he 's a straight shooter , 1,000 percent a straight shooter . " <p> O'Neal and other players said Riley has all but abandoned the Knute Rockne-esque speeches for which he used to be famous , figuring his team was too grown up for cheerleading and theatrics , but he seems to have devised new ways to motivate . A large blanket with a " Do Not Touch ! " sign appeared in the middle of the Heat 's locker room midway through the playoffs , covering what appeared to be a giant bowl . <p> Heat players have declined to reveal its contents . When asked about the bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who used to ask guests to rip up $100 bills and throw them into a pot in his living room . The anecdote did little to unravel the mystery . <p> Thus far during the playoffs , the Heat has been at its best after things looked most bleak . That might be Riley 's best hand . <p> " Everybody 's written our team off , even in Chicago " in the first round , Riley said . " We lost two games to Chicago and then we got buried by New Jersey in the first game of the second round . We were history , and then we were history against Detroit in the conference finals . . . . I 'm sure we 're history right now . <p> " We 'll see what happens at home . "
