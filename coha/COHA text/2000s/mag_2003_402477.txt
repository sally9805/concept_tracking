A FINELY GRAFTED POEM CAN PROVIDE THE RECEPTIVE READER WITH A QUICK JOLT OF JOY AND A LASTING SENSE OF WONDER . By Heather Caldwell // If A Working Girl Ca n't Win , as Deborah Garrison suggests in the title of her 1998 best-selling poetry book , then why am I delighted to find myself so perfectly described in its pages ? I 'm a working girl ( a thirty-four-year-old harried New York-based journalist ) , but I feel like a winner every time I pick up Garrison 's book-or any wonderful poetry collection , for that matter . Because for me , reading good poetry is a vacation from the rest of life . It offers a still , secluded spot where an overburdened soul can rest ; a place where , to borrow from Charles Baudelaire , the great French poet of the 19th century , " there is nothing else but grace and measure , /richness , quietness and pleasure . " And now it seems that the rest of the world is on holiday along with me : more popular and accessible than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively renaissance . Poetry owes its current vitality to rising young stars like Kevin Young , Brenda Shaughnessy and Rachel Wetzsteon , along with such established figures as Garrison and American poet laureate Billy Collins.They , and others , have invigorated the genre with their distinct voices while encompassing wildly different subjects and styles . Consider the edgy , sexy slang of Shaughnessy 's highly acclaimed 1999 debut volume , Interior With Sudden Joy . ( She was twenty-nine at the time , one of the youngest poets the venerable Farrar , Straus &; Giroux-onetime home of Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell-had ever published . ) Or savor the stately lyricism of Wetzsteon 's second collection , 1998 's Home and Away ( Penguin ) , which contains an august vision of sex and the city that would make Carrie and her cronies stop short in their stilettos . Shaughnessy and Wetzsteon are both in their thirties and relatively unknown . But even if you have n't picked up a poetry book since high school , you 've likely heard of Billy Collins . Not since Robert Frost has a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins has . His last three volumes have broken sales records for poetry ; Sailing Alone Around the Room ( Random House ) appears in airport bookstores next to the most recent work by John Grisham . Teen People , a magazine more likely to mention , say , the latest and raciest Judy Blume novel than a book of poetry , even published an effusive review of Collins 's last work . But then Blume herself ca n't stop praising Collins , whom she calls " remarkable , brilliant , clever . One night I recited his poem ' The Lanyard ' to my husband , and we could n't stop laughing . " The poem , part of which follows , is , according to Collins , a meditation on a boy 's indebtedness to his mother : I had never seen anyone use a lanyard or wear one , if that 's what you did with them , but that did not keep me from crossing strand over strand again and again until I had made a boxy red and white lanyard for my mother . She gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a lanyard . The breezy wit and everyday images of Deborah Garrison 's poetry appeal to a similar taste . And , like Collins , she has proven remarkably popular for a poet . An important force in the literary world at large , Brown-educated Garrison joined the editorial staff of The New Yorker at the tender age of twenty and published her first poem in the magazine at twenty-two . Now , at thirty-eight , she heads up the poetry division at the prestigious publishing house Alfred A. Knopf . She believes that the best contemporary poets possess strong individual voices . " Some voices speak to you , and others do n't . You appreciate a poet 's voice like the wine you drink that you love and return to over and over . " But why have n't readers always returned to poetry 's wine cellar ? It 's no secret that many people find poetry intimidating , pretentious , inaccessible - even boring . It was n't always so : Ralph Waldo Emerson , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Robert Frost were celebrities in their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,000 copies in its first week of publication . In the first half of the 20th century , such Frostian phrases as " good fences make good neighbors " became part of the American vernacular . At the same time , however , modernists like Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot were breaking with popular tradition , writing erudite and experimental poetry some readers considered needlessly abstruse . " It was a little like Miles Davis turning his back on the audience , saying , ' I do n't care if you know what I 'm doing or not , ' " says Bill Wadsworth , a poet and former executive director of the Academy of American Poets . " Of course , everyone thought Picasso was difficult . The same was true for Pound and Eliot . " But poetry these days is anything but unintelligible . " Swing , " from Kevin Young 's new collection , Jelly Roll : A Blues ( Knopf ) , gently riffs : " You climb the tree/of me-limbs , // knots , your name / carved right // above the heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - verses that evoke the haunting simplicity of a Bessie Smith or Robert Johnson lyric and capture the spirit of the blues , which " rehearses an emotion , such as despair , in order to get past it . " A former Stegner Fellow in Poetry at Stanford University , thirty-two-year-old Young also edited Giant Steps : The New Generation of African American Writers ( Harper Perennial ) and teaches at Indiana University , where he is the Ruth Lilly Professor of Poetry . ( For her part , Lilly , the octogenarian heiress to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune , made headlines last year when she bequeathed $100 million to Poetry magazine , making this little-known monthly one of the best-endowed arts journals in the world . This comes as two of America 's premier arts funders , the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation , have newly elected heads who are also well-respected poets . ) When I recently spoke to Lawrence Ferlinghetti , whose A Coney Island of the Mind ( 1958 ) has been translated into nine languages and sold nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need a literary education to understand a poem about a dog walking down the street . Poetry should have a public surface , what I call a commonsensual basis , but also deeper levels . " Ruth Stone , the eighty-seven-year-old recipient of last year 's National Book Award for In the Next Galaxy ( Copper Canyon Press ) , says poems are an " emotional opinion . " But I 'd call them emotional global-positioning systems , helping you find your way back to your deepest convictions , fogged-out insights , misplaced dreams . Collins puts it this way : " The poet unplugs the jukebox , taps his glass , says something very profound about life and death , and then hops on his pink motor scooter and disappears to the beach . He always has his escape route . The poet is a better lover because he knows when to leave . The novelist is like a house-guest who wo n't go away . " If a novel is an extended road trip , a poem is a wave of the emotional wand that transports you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to beat one elliptical line of poetry that captures an elusive emotional truth . Sure , I 'm fascinated by Anna Karenina 's obsessive , nine-hundred-plus-page love for Vronsky , but I really want to know why , as Shaughnessy succinctly writes , " I live to leave , but I never either , " or why , according to Stephen Dunn ( another voice to be reckoned with ) , " as we fall in love/we 're already falling out of it . " Poetry like this makes a bite-sized feast out of the bittersweet paradoxes of modern romance . In whatever ways the language of love may have changed since it was the province of Shakespearean sonnets , poetry has kept pace , with wit to spare . For instance , British editor Daisy Goodwill recently published 101 Poems That Could Save Your Life : An Anthology of Emotional First Aid ( HarperCollins ) , which includes a section enticingly titled " Commitment Problems . " ( " Bad Hair Day " and " Retail Therapy " are two other chapters . ) An attractive Cambridge graduate whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart set , " Goodwin hosted a five-part poetry show for Britain 's BBC2 . ( Plans to bring the series to the U.S. are currently under way . ) According to Garrison , the phenomenal success of " spoken word " or " performance poetry " ( stand-up dramatic readings by the authors ) has brought attention to poetry as a whole . An HBO series starring artists who perform in venues as varied as Sing Sing Prison and New York 's Cathedral of St. John the Divine spawned Def Poetry Jam on Broadway , which garnered critical acclaim for its producer , hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons . After the Great White Way , could the next stop for poetry be Hollywood ? Did I fail to mention that Gwyneth Paltrow is set to rip up the screen as the legendary poet-priestess Sylvia Plath ? If rapper Eminem 's success is any indication , verse may even become cool : his recent movie , 8 Mile , depicts an aspiring rap artist who wins respect with his rhymes . ( Eminem himself just won an Oscar for the film 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never amount to more than a silly pursuit for lovesick preteens . " You get a lot of funny looks when you say you 're a poet , " confesses Billy Collins . " The response is ' Oh , really ? Our daughter Tiffany writes poetry . She 's thirteen . ' My response to that is ' What do you do ? ' And if they say , ' Well , I 'm a banker , ' I reply , ' Really ? Why , just the other day our son Timmy was playing with quarters on the living-room floor . He loves change . You should meet . ' " Of course , poetry is n't childish , though sometimes it is childlike-wise and wild , with unfettered access to the imagination . It certainly does n't belong exclusively to the oh-so-serious adult world . " People should n't be afraid of poetry , " says Shaughnessy . " It 's a mirror of our emotional lives . Understanding a poem has nothing to do with intellectual ability . It 's how open you are to seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry in challenging times , and these days , as we face unsettling headlines during our morning commute , it 's no wonder we 've returned to reading it . " Since our world seems to have become so viscerally unsafe , " says Shaughnessy , " we do need poetry more . It 's one of the most ancient soul-soothers . It 's a soul 's spa . " Sidebar TWELVE TIMELESS POEMS It 's nearly impossible to single out a dozen of the greatest poems of all time . As John Keats said , " Poetry should please by a fine excess , and not by singularity . " Still , here are a dozen of my personal favorites : No poem deflates metaphor like , or is earthier than , William Shakespeare 's classic SONNET 130 ( 1609 ) , " My mistress ' eyes are nothing like the sun , " which describes the deeply personal , idiosyncratic nature of love . By contrast , KUBLA KHAN ( 1797-98 ) , by Samuel Taylor Coleridge , blasts readers into " a stately pleasure dome " in Xanadu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1819 ) trips along in ballad meter to a Romantic vision of ravishment . An exuberant salutation to the world , Walt Whitman 's CROSSING BROOKLYN FERRY ( 1856 ) will inspire you to embrace strangers on the street , while THE SOUL SELECTS HER OWN SOCIETY ( 1862 ) , by Emily Dickinson , " shuts the door " and beckons you back to precious solitude . STOPPING BY WOODS ON A SNOWY EVENING ( 1923 ) , by Robert Frost , breathes warmth and coziness . " She sang beyond the genius of the sea , " wrote Wallace Stevens in THE IDEA OF ORDER AT KEY WEST ( 1935 ) , invoking the ocean , the limitless material of creation . In the strange and unsettling VOYAGES ( 1926 ) , Hart Crane demurs : " The bottom of the sea is cruel . " FERN HILL ( 1946 ) , a lilting rhapsody by Dylan Thomas , celebrates a pastoral childhood ; WE REAL COOL ( 1966 ) , by Gwendolyn Brooks , mimics the rhythms of urban boys in a pool hall . Although it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAVING A COKE WITH YOU ( 1966 ) , by Frank O'Hara , is also as romantic as a proffered rose . Finally , how could I forget Mary Oliver 's thrilling exhortation in which she asks , in the last line of THE SUMMER 'S DAY ( 1992 ) : " Tell me , what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life ? " My answer ? Read poetry , of course . H.C . Author Affiliation Raised in Putney , Vermont , " in a farmhouse on a dirt road , " Heather Caldwell fell in love with poetry at an early age . " In my family , it was like good gossip , " she recalls . In " Why Poetry Still Matters " ( " Connoisseur 's World , " page 47 ) , Caldwell details that literary form 's current renaissance and cites a dozen of her favorite poems . Such works , she says , are filled with " language that transforms ordinary experience , language that 's up to the task of describing the weirdness and complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
