NATIONAL In its waning days , the Bush administration published a series of much-criticized last-minute regulations-including one from the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that allows health-care workers to refuse , on religious or moral grounds , to provide certain treatments-such as abortion or contraception , but the possibilities are limitless . HHS ignored more than 200,000 letters in opposition to the regulation , which also allows providers to use this so-called conscience clause to refuse giving medical referrals to patients they wo n't treat . Additionally , it will , for the first time , allow recipients of Title X familyplanning funding to withhold information about abortion as an option . Congress has several ways it can try to block the regulation from taking effect this January , including passing legislation proposed by Sens . Hillary Clinton ( D-N.Y. ) and Patty Murray ( D-Wash . ) . If those avenues fail , the Obama administration-which does not support the rule-could undertake a new rule-making process . The Food and Drug Administration has unanimously backed a less-expensive version of the female condom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . The new condom , called FC2 , could reach larger groups of women who ca n't afford the cost of the current product ( between $2.50 and $4 ) , and could thus help combat the spread of sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV/AIDS . The United States is one of the last countries to adopt the newer , nitrile-based female condoms , which are softer and quieter than the polyurethane type . Said Deborah Arrindell of the American Social Health Association , a group that promotes sexual health awareness , " Female condoms are the only woman-controlled method of safer sex . " CALIFORNIA The California State University system has agreed to pay Lindy Vivas $5.2 million to settle her Title IX sexdiscrimination lawsuit ( see " Full Court Press , " Spring 2008 ) . Vivas , a former volleyball coach at Fresno State University , was one of two former coaches and an athletics director who lost their jobs after complaining about gender inequalities within the addetics department at the university . All three women sued and have now settled-two of them , including Vivas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm very pleased for Lindy , " said Vivas ' attorney , Dan Siegel . " She did not deserve what happened to her . This money , this compensation , is a small but incomplete redress for what she experienced . " A new study of 3 5 car dealerships in Southern California has found that women and minorities are quoted significantly higher prices on new cars . In comparing prices quoted to potential buyers , researchers from the University of California , San Diego , found that minority women were generally given the highest quote , followed by white women , minority men and white men . The study was commissioned as a follow-up to a 1990 study by other researchers that showed the existence of a " color tax " and " gender tax " on new car purchases . The 2008 study also found that white men selling cars at dealerships charged higher prices than minority salespersons . KANSAS In December , the Kansas Supreme Court delivered a forceful condemnation of Phill Kline-the state 's former attorney general and also the former Johnson County district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three dozen patients at a Planned Parenthood clinic in the county . Kline obtained most of the material while attorney general , then forwarded the records to himself when he became the county D.A . and used the evidence to file 107 abortion-related criminal counts against the Overland Park clinic . His only sanction , however , was the requirement that he send a complete set of the medical records to the state 's current attorney general . " We 're still trying to prevent him from taking any copies of the records himself or supplying summaries of them to his political allies in the antichoice community , as he 's done before , " said Peter Brownlie , president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri . He added , " The justices confirmed what we have said all along-Phill Kline is a zealot pursuing a lawless prosecution . " NEW HAMPSHIRE The New Hampshire Senate has become the first state legislature in American history to be composed of a majority of women members . Three more women were elected to seats in November , boosting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New Hampshire has already had a woman governor , Jean Shaheen , and in the November election selected her as its first woman U.S. senator . " As the first-in-the-nation primary state , we are always glad to lead the way , " said state Senate President Sylvia Larsen . It must be noted , however , that the New Hampshire Senate is one of the lowest-paid in the nation , with legislators earning just $200 per two-year term and no per diem . NEW JERSEY A recent lawsuit involving the Atlantic City Police Department has confirmed fears that it suffers from a serious sexual harassment problem . Police Officer Michele Zanes will receive a $750,000 setdement from the city after filing a suit claiming that 23 of her fellow officers harassed her over more than six years . Including Zanes ' case , the ACPD has paid out almost $4 million in the past eight years to women police officers filing harassment suits . The largest payouts went to the city 's first woman sergeant , Donna Hurley-who won a 1996 federal sexual harassment lawsuit ( which included charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung above her during a roll call ) and then settled a second suit for $1.4 million after allegations that she was retaliated against for filing the first suit-and to Officer Deborah Rando , who received a $1.25 million setdement in 2004 for her claim that the brakes on a patrol bike she used were deliberately disconnected . Feminist groups are calling for a revision to the department 's antiharassment policies and procedures . NEW YORK New York Gov . David Paterson garnered kudos from women's-rights supporters when he expressed outrage that no women were included on a list of seven nominees for chief judge of the state 's highest court , the Court of Appeals . The list was prepared by a state commission . Three women currently sit on the seven-person court , which was presided over by Chief Judge Judy Kaye before her resignation took effect at the end of 2008 . Paterson has asked the state attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , to explore whether he 's obligated by law to pick from the list or has other options . In a decision particularly important to transgender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ruled that a transgender woman has the right to legally change her name without providing medical backup . The only reasons for denying such a change , said the court , are " fraud , misrepresentation or interference with the rights of others . " The decision came after a 5 7-year-old transgender woman petitioned to have her name legally changed to " Elisabeth " Golden , which she had been using for years to reflect her female gender identity . State Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey Tait initially suggested that Golden provide private affidavits from physicians or therapists before a legal name change . When she refused , Tait denied her petition , stating that the name change would be " fraught with possible confusion . " The Appellate Division promptly reversed his decision and stated that lack of medical evidence or possible " confusion " are not grounds for denying such petitions . Golden hopes that " someday transgender people will not have to fight to have the same rights as other Americans . " - AMY GOODWIN , KATIE PRESLEY , PAULA SILINGER       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
