We 've heard her soulful , earthy voice , reveled in her heartfelt , womanin-love lyrics . We 've seen her smiling face with twinkling eyes , enjoyed her down-to-earth , jazzed-up stage performances . We 've even seen her sing on television , paying tribute to her greatest influence , Aretha Franklin . Jill Scott has been called the " premier female romantic voice-of the neosoul era . " One magazine named her one of " 50 most beautiful people . " A music industry insider says he can see Jill smiling when he hears her singing . Another says God is talking to him through Jill Scott . Her music has been described not only as hip-hop but also as poetry and R &B; and jazz , as " introspective " and " hypnotic , " as a " thorough sensual appraisal . " There have been comparisons to Billie Holidays aching sensuality , Lauryn Hill 's earthiness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question- " Who is Jill Scott ? " - continues to beg for a definitive answer . Scott herself says she is a poet and singer and , based on her lyrics and words , a woman in love-in love with her man , her music , her soul . In love with life . " I would say I 'm a whole woman who is on a long journey , " she says when asked the million-dollar question . " It began with music , and writing . . " She hesitates . " Basically , I ca n't answer the question , for what I do is to invite folks to watch and to enjoy . I 'm an artist . " A very successful one , though success for Jill Scott is not measured by dollars , albums sold or by whether people like her or not . Yet , success has found this spirited creative force and infused her into the hearts of fans around the world . The Philadelphia native 's platinum album , Who Is Jill Scott ? , has sold more than a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A clever , gifted lyricist , she writes about love and related matters that consume the heart and soul of a Sister from the neighborhood . A poet and actor before venturing into music , Scott 's music is peppered with bursts of spokenword segments , interspersed with melodic vocal offerings . She is a prolific wordsmith who co-wrote each of the songs on her CD , her favorites from more than 50 she put together . Her alto is clear , earthy and soulful ; and her womanly desires and needs are spelled out , passionately . " No question about it , my songs are created from places I 've been , something I 've seen , something I 've felt . It 's all coming right out of me , " she says . " I just put my thoughts down . I keep with me a notebook I pick up from the dollar store . I place stickers all over the book so I can see the places I 've been during that time . The words wake me up sometimes . I see them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . Sometimes I have to sleep to hear the song . Sometimes they wo n't let me sleep . I have vivid dreams , where I see the whole thing .. When it 's time to write , I must . To others I have to say , Sorry , I ca n't help you right now . That 's why , she says , this " celebrity " that has engulfed her over the past year is difficult at times . While she appreciates the support of fans , she is sometimes caught off guard when concentrating on a thought that is evolving into a poem or a lyric . " Some folk tap you on the shoulder and pull you out of the dream , " she says . " That has been hard for me , because I want to be respectable of folk . " She says she signed with Hidden Beach because she was impressed with the fact that CEO Steve McKeever ( " the keeper , the young visionary , the Chicago Brother " ) was interested in her music , her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Scott , only wanted to know , right up front , how she looked . " Jill 's the ideal artist to usher in Hidden Beach , " says McKeever , previously an executive with Polygram and Motown , where he launched the MoJazz label . " She 's both a throwback to the days of real music ' and compelling artists , and a representative of the emerging cadre of new , relevant performers who will set the tempo for the next generations . " One of Hidden Beach 's " guiding philosophies " is to give artists the creative freedom to try new genres and musical styles , and that obviously is what caught Scott 's attention . " Steve has a passion for and sincerity in music and about music , " she says . " I also knew I 'd be able to run my own show . There would be nobody telling me what I could and could not do , from the artwork to the presentation , not only the music .

" " I was on the bus on the way to an audition , maybe the third or fourth callback , " she recalls . " When I heard that beat , it sounded like a summer day . From there the words just started coming and I just went with it . Much of it was part of my fiance 's and my first date . That 's when we met . We just went to the park and got a chance to learn how to look at each other . Long Walk is really a metaphor for life . If you rush and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take a long walk . . . At age 28 , Scott is stepping through life with grace and style . Even when she was a child growing up in North Philly , those around her realized she was special . Vivacious and " very loved , " she learned to glow in the spotlight , reading and acting out stories for family and friends . She grew up with her mother , Joyce Scott , and her grandmother , and she is still close to both . " I have a great relationship with my mother , " she says . " I remember her being a carpenter , putting up drywall and paintings , refurbishing old furniture and discovering antiques . " Over the years her mother worked in various jobsas a dental technician , operating a day-care center and refurbishing antiques . Her mom is now a receptionist in a hair salon and " practices reflexology . " Says Jill of her mother : " She does whatever she wants to do . And I love her for that . Sometimes it was a little hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She goes with what is moving in her heart through her spirit . And I love her for that so much because that is where I am . I do n't feel chained or locked , with anything or anyone . I allow my spirit to lead , and there 's a spirit that leads that spirit ; and so far I am just amazed because that 's where I am . " Initially that spirit led Scott to Temple University , where she studied to be a high school English teacher while performing poetry and exploring theater on the weekends and evenings . After three years she became disillusioned , dropped out and quit her job as a teacher 's aide . That same day she received a call offering her a theater apprenticeship . That led to her performing with the Canadian cast of Rent , poetry readings and opportunities to meet others in the performing arts community . Scott also co-wrote with the Roots the hit " You Got Me , " which won a best-rap Grammy for Erykah Badu . The vocalist began to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly performed with Will Smith . It was Townes who sent out Scott 's demo CDs , which led to her signing with Hidden Beach Recordings . He produced Who Is Jill Scott ? In addition to her music , Scott has a great love for Lyzel Williams , her longtime friend and now fiance who is the inspiration for many of her songs . She met Williams , a graphic artist by day and DJ by night , about eight years ago after he sat in the middle of the aisle during a poetry reading and she just could n't keep her eyes off him . Marriage is on the horizon , she says , but not a " celebrity wedding . " In the song " He Loves Me Lyzel in E Flat , " she sings with sensuous passion : " You love me especially different every time / You keep me on my feet / Happily excited by your cologne , your hands , your smile / Your intelligence/You woo me , you court me , you tease me , you please me .. . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " and I love him for that . I love him so much . " She says what she likes about Williams is : " He 's a man , not a boy trying to be a man . He 's steadfast , strong . Every day in his walk , he carries a love and respect for his woman ... I totally respect him . " She also loves herself and insists that others treat her with respect . " What makes me angry with people is when they pull and tug on me and in some sense do n't respect the fact that I 'm royalty , " she says . " Mv power is my own , and it 's coming different from everyone else in the world . " Such uniqueness makes Jill Scott stand out in a sea of pop and hip-hop artists , and she learned long ago to follow her own mind and heart . On " One Is The Magic Number , " she sings of self-love : " So many times I defined my pride through somebody else 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / found a lasting love for me /Ifl am searching for my spirituality passionately /I must begin with me . " It 's a lesson she had to learn . " Trying to find out who I was , trying to find myself in the image of the magazines and the TV was just foolish , " she explains . " Because we all have such a power within us . People keep talking about God and heaven . It 's in here , in my gut . Everybody has a place . Whether you are fat or thin , blue-eyed , blind-everybody has a power . And it 's their own . Look through your spirit . " That 's how she found herself and discovered who Jill Scott really is .
