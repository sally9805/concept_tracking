Chapter One Raphe studied the wound in the palm of his hand . The hole still had n't healed . The surgeon said it would take weeks-the blade had gone all the way through and out the other side . It was a miracle no nerves were severed . It still hurt a little , especially when he made a fist . " Jesus . " Raphe shook his head and laughed . He did n't deserve it . His life was like a cruel joke . All he ever did was love one too many . Where was the crime in that ? Yet he 'd been punished the same as if he 'd committed unspeakable atrocities . He 'd been pushed into poverty , faced a death sentence , and then this . He looked up at the framed parchment hanging by a nail just above his computer . With his good hand he took it down . " To all men who are about to read this document , everlasting greetings of the Lord ... " In pretentious Latin , no less . His diploma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it landed in a sea of bloodied bandages , the waste from the constant cleaning and redressing of the gash . " Stupid fool . " Raphe took a tube of antibiotic cream and carefully dabbed the ointment on both sides of his hand . He awkwardly peeled two large adhesive bandages from their sterile packaging and nimbly covered each hole , being careful to avoid touching the centers . Then he grabbed one of the latex gloves the doctor had given him , advising him to completely cover the entire hand toprevent any risk of infection . He held it up to the ceiling light . It was such a strange thing to behold-a hand encased in rubber . Too weird for what he had to do . Last time he went out with it on , people stared at him as if he were a freak . He did n't want people laughing at him . Not tonight . He rummaged around the bottom drawer of his dresser until he found a pair of black leather gloves , the type race car drivers wore . He 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool for driving his old , beat-up Camaro . He slipped a leather glove over the latex . Much better . It added a certain air of mystery . He 'd just wear the one . He sprinkled a few pinches of shiny powder into a small glass of water and gulped it down . Not the best way , but he had to take the edge off . The packed black bag sat on the floor . He peered inside to double-check and make sure he had everything he needed . The mask looked frightening , perfectly designed for secrecy and intimidation . He counted the tubes , all neatly sealed in their sterile packaging . Then there was the saline , and the needles . More than enough for what he had to do . He tossed a pair of old sweatpants on top . He 'd never be able to fit back into his jeans later . It would be too painful . Before leaving , he sized himself up in his bedroom mirror . He needed to be sure he had his head on straight . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own way this would be a night for payback . Fate had taken him on the strangest journey into worlds he never knew existed . He 'd seen things , done things , that would make the old Raphe blush or run away . Funny how you ca n't be a fugitive from yourself . Where the hell would you go ? Now it was Mark Hazodo 's turn to face his destiny . Raphe always thought they 'd meet again-San Francisco was a small town that way . He just never expected it to happen so soon and under such bizarre circumstances . Still , this was his opening . Who knew if he 'd get another chance like this one ? An old wisecrack popped into Raphe 's mind : Today I am handing out lollipops and ass-kickin 's . And I am all out of lollipops . His thoughts pulsed with images . A flash of that beautiful , red hair . His baptism into that other world . The cleansing waters . The bizarre , purple house . He shook off the pictures that bombarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder first hit . Some day he 'd sort it all and write down what happened . Maybe even put it into a book . Of course , no one would believe him . But it was all true . Chapter Two " Dr. Kaplan , Suite One ? " Raphe turned his head up from his book . The Dr. Kaplan question again . It was the third time so far that day . This time the query came from a blond man in his late twenties . Nice lean build , with too much tan on his face for April . Got ta be a surfer . " I 'm sorry , " Raphe deadpanned from his stool behind the counter . He tugged on the small tuft of hair under his chin . " There 's no one here by that name . " The blond looked around the room . He noted the dozens of built-in mailboxes affixed to the wall . It was clearly no doctor 's office-just a mail drop . Shaking his head in disgust , the man quietly walked back out onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop was called . No outdoor marquee or door sign that might even vaguely describe what the business offered . The name was just the street address , and vice versa . There were operations just like it peppered throughout the neighborhoods of San Francisco , their low-profile key to their success with certain seedy customers . Anonymous mailboxes , all transactions in cash , no questions asked . Mr. Harrington owned the entire chain . At least he said his name was Harrington , though Raphe knew the moniker was as suspect as the shady business empire . Harrington was in his fifties with gray hair , streaked in occasional rows of black as if a dye job had started to leach out , all of it slicked back by pomade . He always sported one of dozens of different large-print , untucked Hawaiian shirts . Around his neck he wore a medallion of the Virgin Mary in gold , the size of an Olympic prize , studded with a circle of rubies . He was so clearly Mexican it pained him just to pronounce the name " Harrington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facade . " What 's with this Dr. Kaplan ? " Raphe asked . " I keep getting all these guys coming in and asking to see him . " " Do n't ax questions , " Harrington replied . " What I tell you ' bout that ? " Raphe felt slightly foolish for his lapse . He knew Harrington would never share his secrets . He did n't have to . Within days of starting the job , Raphe figured out on his own that the shop was no mere mailbox drop . It was a safe haven for con artists of all sorts : diploma mills , magic-mushroom seed orders , herbal HGH . If there was a way to separate a loser from his money , then the " corporate headquarters " for such ventures inevitably seemed to be 225 Folsom . Raphe shrugged off Harrington 's scolding and turned his head back down into his book , a translation of Georges Bataille 's twisted Story of the Eye . It was amazing the sick shit people were into , even eighty years ago . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tik bathroom breek ? " " Uh , no . I 'm okay , " Raphe said . The office did n't have its own toilet , so Raphe used the McDonald 's down the block . Not having a bathroom had to be some sort of code violation , but it seemed pointless to explain laws to a con man . Besides , Raphe had come to enjoy those moments when he could lock up , tape a " back in 5 " sign to the glass door , and slip away to Ronald 's world for respite . Why complain ? 225 Folsom existed on the fringe of legal , which is exactly where Raphe needed to be . He was n't paid much , just five hundred dollars per week , but it was all in cash and under the table-an arrangement that would n't affect his unemployment benefits . He needed every dime to keep up with the payments on the condo . He could n't risk losing that , even though it was an excessive throwback to better days . The dot-com days . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the market ! The mortgage payments would break him if it was n't for 225 Folsom . These days he was like so many formerly upwardly mobile young men in The City , now betrayed and abandoned by the gone world of technology riches . Metrosexuals without means . How he hated that word . At least seor Harrington only demanded a modicum of effort . Most of the time Raphe could just lean up against the counter and read . The solitude allowed him to ponder for the first time what Camus really meant . When Raphe felt ambitious , he jotted down a few notes for the outline of his interminably delayed book-the great American novel told through the eyes of a young adventurer making his way to the big city , living the dream of success until one day an epiphany strikes and he finds ... " Adios , " Harrington said cheerfully , interrupting Raphe 's mental doodling . Then , catching his slip , Harrington added soberly , " Uh , I mean gid-bye ... old chap ! " Alone again . Sometimes hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job , the solitude seemed appealing . He did n't count on the paralyzing nature of boredom . He craved customers , even the creepy ones who patronized such a place . At the very least , they provided fodder-bits and pieces-for the still ill-conceived characters he wanted to populate his own pages with someday . Raphe quickly learned the types of people who ran scams were careful , nearly invisible . They purposefully let their correspondence accumulate for days . When they came to retrieve their latest pile of victims , they 'd be in and out of the shop in less than thirty seconds . Even after six months , Raphe would have found it impossible to pick out a single face if forced to be a witness at a police line up . If there was business to be done at the counter , like paying up the next several weeks of the extortion-level fees that Harrington demanded , Raphe had been instructed never to make eye contact . He could count on only two worthwhile distractions per day . At exactly 9:15 each morning the red-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was stunning , in her twenties like himself , and would always smile at Raphe as she walked past the glass front of the shop . He would smile back . He hoped they 'd graduate to exchanging little waves soon . In time , maybe they 'd even say hello . He wished the smell of McDonald 's hash browns would beckon her one morning . He 'd jump in line behind her , finally giving himself the opportunity to converse . But she was never corrupted by the scent . The other highlight of the day came when the mail arrived around ten each morning . Raphe would take the piles and sort them into the various boxes in the wall . Mindless drudgery , but at least it distracted from the tedium . It was in these moments of manual labor that his thoughts floated off into fanciful worlds and memories . He 'd daydream about the red-haired woman from upstairs , contriving little scenes where he 'd be so witty and charming , and she 'd respond with raw animal lust . Women . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go out with dot-com debris ? Sorting the mail allowed his mind to escape to a fantasy parallel universe where there was no tech meltdown and Raphe was successful , wanted , and loved . Placing the envelopes in all the little mailboxes could be done in as little as twenty minutes , but on most days he would stretch the duty out for more than an hour . At his last job at a big web site design firm he 'd worked with his mind all day , leaving little brainpower left in the evenings when he planned to do his writing . At the height of the dot-com craze the work was frantic , the projects moronically ill-conceived . Not that it mattered . Since so much money was coming in , the CEO complained he was " going to need a pitchfork " to handle it all . Meanwhile , Raphe 's frustrations with his own thwarted ambitions to write developed into ulcerative pains whenever he entered a bookstore , overwhelmed by the thousands of bound accomplishments that surrounded him while he remained unpublished . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frivolous and fun , with its casual bull pen atmosphere , roaming pets , and never-ending , free supply of caffeinated soda . But it was n't all laughs for those few who actually did the work . From college economics Raphe remembered the classic 80/20 Principle-that 80 percent of the work is done by just 20 percent of the workforce . Like most employment concepts of the past , dotcom had turned that old theory on its head . In the web world , it was more like the 95/5 Principle , with Raphe stuck among the toiling few . His first big job , and Raphe was already bitter . " It 's a business that does systems analysis for corporations . " As he sorted the day 's mail , Raphe remembered those fateful words from an attractive blonde venture capitalist looking to hire the firm . Was it two years ago ? Spring 2000 . It seemed like yesterday . " So we were thinking of AnalysisBusiness.com as the name for the site . " That 's stupid , Raphe thought from his disgruntled corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the VC woman continued , " that name is already taken . Some virtual psychology site . So what we were thinking is shortening the title to something catchier . Just use the first four letters of ' analysis ' and say ' bizz ' instead of ' business . ' " Raphe already had four other projects to handle , and this was to be his fifth . The perky blonde 's presentation hit him as the final straw . He already put in seventy hours a week , and now he was about to become the laughingstock of the office . " You 're shitting me ! " Raphe burst out . " Excuse me ? " the woman said , straining to keep her relentless smile . " You want to call this site ' AnalBizz ' ? ' AnalBizz ' ! Are you fucking serious ? " " It 's not ' Anal-bizz , ' " she countered , now clearly flustered . " It 's ' anaaahl-bizz . ' As in ' analysis . ' Not ... ' anal . ' It 's ' anaaahl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make her point , but it was too late . She was humiliated , and Raphe would not let it go . " It does n't matter how you pronounce it . It 's spelled ' anal . ' That 's how people will see it . They 're gon na think it 's a site for butt plugs or something . We 'll probably get porn traffic ! " " Well , hits are hits , right ? " the woman said sheepishly . When no one else was looking , she stared across the table into Raphe 's eyes . He knew what she was thinking . Who the fuck do you think you are ? When the tech bubble burst months later , and the gravy stopped flowing , Raphe was in the first round of layoffs . All the other dismissals were done by seniority , but his " bad attitude " pushed him to the front of the pink slip line . He 'd been scrounging ever since . " Excuse me . " The voice startled Raphe , so lost in his mail-sorting dotcom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaplan , Suite One ? " " What ? " " Dr. Kaplan , Suite One , " the voice said again , much more determined and confident the second time . Raphe stood up from his sorting and turned . It was a young man this time . A teenager ? " There 's no Dr. Kaplan here . I 'm sorry . You have the wrong place . " " This is 225 Folsom , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " Well , Dr. Kaplan 's office is at 225 Folsom , Suite One . You sure it 's not here ? Maybe on an upper floor ? I really do need to see him . It 's urgent . " Upstairs ? Raphe thought of the red-haired woman . She was definitely not Dr. Kaplan . The young man seemed almost panicked , as if his life somehow depended on finding this doctor . Raphe had been told how to handle these situations his first day on the job . " Jus ax stipid , " Harrington told him . Their customers paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was best to play ignorant . Besides , it would be a good defense if the police ever raided , or if a scam victim decided to show up for revenge . The young man standing before him did n't look like the type Raphe figured fell for rip-offs like these . He always thought of them as double-wide trailer types , grifting for a way to make a quick buck in some scheme . If they got taken , then it was probably for the best-it proved Darwin was right . This guy was different . Just a kid . A college boy maybe , or even high school . He was certainly young enough , dressed in the Old Navy requirements of his middle-class generation . Raphe thought he saw tears forming in the young man 's blue eyes . " I really need to see him . " It was n't Raphe 's job to feel sorry for anyone , or teach a wayward teenager a lesson about life . He knew that . Still , there was something about this kid that got to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , or the fact that Raphe was so bored he was curious to see how it all would play out . " Over there . " Raphe pointed to the wall . " What ? " The young man 's face filled with hope . Raphe gestured again , and the kid walked across the room . He stared at the wall of mailboxes . " I do n't understand . " Raphe walked over . " Welcome to Suite One , " he said , placing his hand on mailbox number one . (
