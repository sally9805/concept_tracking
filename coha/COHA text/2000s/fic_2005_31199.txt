Children of God The ad said they needed someone to model " patterns of survival . " At the interview , a woman with an E.T . poster on her door told me about the job . " You 'd be working at their house , " she said , " taking care of two clients with special needs . " I could n't even take care of myself , but I needed a job . " Are they retarded ? " " Okay , yeah . We do n't say that anymore . " She coaxed herself out of a frown , in a way that suggested I was the only candidate . " There 's a new name : developmentally disabled . " They gave me a new name , too : Community Living Instructor . This was in Portland , Oregon . I started working at a home for people who could n't tie their shoes , helping two grown men get through the day . Jason was worse off . At twenty-eight , he was afflicted with so many diseases that his meds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a whiner . Enlarged by hydrocephalus , his head drooped from his body , which twisted in his wheelchair as if it were trying to unscrew from his neck . His mouth hung open in a constant drool . His hands , crippled from dystrophy , curled inward as though he wanted to clutch his own wrists . Among other things , he was prone to seizures and cataleptic fits . He had chronic diarrhea . Every evening , after dinner , I was met with a smell so astounding I had to plug my nose with cotton . I 'd wheel Jason , besmirched and grinning , to the bedroom to change his mess . " I made a bad , bad meeeesss ! " he 'd yell , flapping his arms . " Now we 're cooking with oil ! " For the most part , his vocabulary consisted of cliches he 'd picked up from former care workers , many of them bizarre or unsavory to start with : " cooking with oil " was one , as was " you said a mouthful when you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising clarity . He loved action movies  --  particularly ones in which nature avenged itself on humanity  --  and would recount the death of a dinosaur hunter as if it were a sidesplitting joke . The changing of the mess , though , was the high point of Jason 's day . He giggled uproariously when I lifted him from the wheelchair , his arms kinked around my neck as I carried him to bed . He never failed , during our brief walk together , to burrow his tongue deep into my ear . Dominic was more serious . Brooding , treacherously off balance , he staggered around the house like a drunk . Down syndrome had smudged his face into the flat , puttylike features of a Hollywood gangster . He was beautiful in a way that startled women . He was thirty-two years old and owned a bike with a banana seat and training wheels . The bike was supposed to be impossible to tip over . He 'd strap a helmet on his head and wiggle into an armature of pads and then go for a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . I cleaned his wounds with a sponge . About ten times a day , he 'd sneak into the bathroom to " fresh his breath . " He always left the door open , and I 'd watch him sometimes from the hall . He 'd nurse the faucet first , sucking on it until his mouth filled with water . Then he 'd pop up suddenly and arch his back in a triumphant stance , face lifted toward the ceiling . Sometimes he 'd stay like that for thirty seconds  --  moaning , arms outstretched , eyes shut tight like a shaman receiving prophecies  --  before puking his guts out in the sink . His voice , when he spoke , was sleepy and far-fetched . He preferred the middles of words . " Abyoola ! " he liked to say , meaning " Fabulous ! " When he told a story , it was like Rocky Balboa channeling a demon . I 'd moved to Portland after a month of sleeping in my car , driving aimlessly around the West and living off my father 's Mobil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling in my stomach . I felt like Wile E. Coyote when he goes off a cliff , stranded in midair and trying to crawl back to the edge before he plummets . In the glove box , sealed with plastic and a rubber band , was a Dixie cup of my mother 's ashes that I 'd nabbed from her memorial when I was twelve . I kept it there for good luck . Before my month of driving , I 'd taped Sheetrock in Idaho , sold vacuum cleaners in Missoula , Montana , worked as a baggage handler at the Salt Lake City airport . To pass the day , I took Jason and Dominic on field trips . There was a special van in the garage , and I 'd load Jason onto the lift and strap down his wheels so he would n't roll out the window . The van had been donated by a traveling magician and was painted purple . We 'd drive to cafes , outdoor fairs , movie theaters . They liked easy-listening stations  --  " I Write the Songs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crank the old AM stereo as loud as it would go . I 'd roll down the windows and listen to Jason scream words at the top of his lungs , naming the passing creatures of the world like Adam on a roller coaster . " Dog ! " he 'd yell . " Girl ! Pizza boy ! " Dominic would stick his head out the window of the front seat , his hair exploding in the wind . Someone had taught him how to flip people off and he 'd give pedestrians the finger as we passed . It was a good test of character , and I liked watching people question the simplicity of innocence . Once , at a stoplight , a guy in a fraternity sweatshirt returned the gesture and then strode up to Dominic 's side of the van , his girlfriend sloping behind him . The guy 's arm was outstretched to better advertise his finger , which he was following like a carrot . " What the fuck , man , " the guy said to Dominic . " You looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's face , enjoying himself immensely . " We 're going to get some ice cream , " I explained . The guy took a closer look at Dominic and turned red . He dropped his hand and glanced at his girlfriend , who was regarding him with distaste . " You should teach them some manners , " he mumbled . " This is n't the goddamn circus . " At Baskin-Robbins , we waited in line while the customers ahead of us sucked on little spoons . Dominic ogled the women . He was a pervert only because of his IQ ; otherwise , he 'd have been concealing his interest like the rest of us . It was more metaphysical than sexual . Sometimes I 'd find him staring at a lingerie-clad model in a magazine , struck dumb with fervor , his lips moving silently as if in prayer . While we waited , Jason slumped in his wheelchair and I wiped the drool from his chin . The woman in front of us kept glancing back at him . It was always the same expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , like we shared some secret knowledge about the afterlife . Finally , she could n't resist any longer and squatted beside Jason . " What 's your favorite flavor ? " she brayed , as if she were speaking to a foreigner . He seemed to study the case of ice cream . " Like trying to sell Jesus a jogging suit ! " " That 's right , dear , " the woman muttered but did n't talk to him again . When it was Dominic 's turn to order , he staggered around the counter before I could stop him and stood by the cash register . The girl behind the counter laughed . He stared at her breasts without speaking . I might have done something to ward off disaster , but I wanted to see what would happen . " Show me what you want , " she said . It was the wrong thing to say . Dominic grabbed one of her breasts . " Hey , " the girl said , laughing . She tried to pull away and he held on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , incredulous despair . " Hey ! " the girl said . Finally , I ran around the counter and pulled Dominic off with two hands , leading him back to the customer side , where he seemed unembarrassed by his conduct . It was always like that : the world scorned them , but they were freely and openly themselves . I admired them greatly . We tried to order ice cream , but the girl was shaken and refused to serve us . I lived in a studio apartment with no phone . The only piece of furniture was a pea-colored sofa I 'd bought at the Goodwill and dragged up five flights of stairs by myself . For three days , because of my poor grasp of geometry , it remained lodged vertically in the doorway . I was still on the Mobil dining plan : maple bars and hot dogs and Snapple iced tea . I had a box of books and a box of cooking utensils , but I never unpacked them . My dad moved away when I was in college and took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie star at all but somebody who used to stand in for movie stars during long or onerous rehearsals . She had n't been on a set for years but liked to talk about " Bob " Redford and " Marty " Sheen . My father had convinced her he was rich . Now they lived in Utah , in the middle of the desert , and he was taking care of her children . I 'd called my dad from a pay phone , the month I was living out of my Subaru . " You surprised me , " he said . " Where are you ? " " Las Vegas . " " Jesus , Drew . What are you doing in Vegas ? " " Good one . Seeing some friends . " Actually , I 'd spent the afternoon in a casino bathroom , shivering on the toilet and battling suicidal fantasies , visions of myself with my brains blown out and soaking in a puddle . " I was thinking I 'd drive up and stay with you guys for a few days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fine . I mean great . Come on up . " He hesitated , and I could hear a woman 's voice in the background . " It 's Drew , " my dad said . " Drew ? Hang on a sec , will you ? " He put his hand over the receiver . For a long time , I could n't hear anything but the ring of a slot machine behind me . Then the sound came back and I caught the tail end of a sentence in the background , the woman 's voice saying , " running a B &; B. " " Drew ? This weekend 's a little hectic . You know we 've got five of us here already and the place is a mess . " I laughed , but it sounded as far off as the slot machine . Chink chink chink . " The thing is , " my dad said , " I 'm not sure where you 'll sleep . " " Jackpot , " I said before hanging up . " Do you hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd sit at the dining room table and sift through the day 's mail , giggling at the letters addressed to " Cigar Lover " or " Channel Surfer . " Sometimes , from the mailbox on the corner , I 'd send them postcards I 'd collected on my travels , thirty-cent souvenirs picturing places like Orchard Homes , Montana , or Mexican Hat , Utah . " Wish you were here ! " I 'd write . Or " Having the time of my life ! " We put the postcards in a shoe box in case the happy stranger returned . One day , sometime in March , Dominic got a sweepstakes letter and we opened it excitedly . I filled out the necessary information , showing him how to paste the publisher 's stamps in the little squares . For a week after we 'd sent it in , he seemed mercurial , distracted . He was particularly excited about the grand prize  --  a 1969 Mustang convertible with a galloping horse on the grille  --  and I helped him put the glossy picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift one night , I started from a nap at 5:00 a.m. when the front door creaked open . I went to investigate and saw Dominic sitting on the steps like a gloomy wino in his Fruit of the Looms , squinting at the half-lit street . " What are you doing , Dominic ? " I asked , putting my hand on his shoulder . " Ooing , " he said , in his no-consonant drone . " Yes , doing . It 's five in the morning . " He looked at me queerly . " Ar , " he said , meaning " car . " Since his subjects were limited , I 'd learned to translate his words into their probable correlates . " Red car no roof ! " he explained . In my tired state , I pictured the red convertible rolling down the street , tied up with a giant bow . I explained to him the chances were one in a trillion . " There 's no car , Dominic . It 's a scam  --  a game , you see ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance at all . " He stared at me without comprehending . " Car ! Red car go fast ! " " Besides , you ca n't drive . You 'd crash it anyway . " " No crash ! " he said angrily , rising to his feet . Spit flew from his lips . Such passion ! I would have given anything to care like that . I got Dominic to bed finally but lay wide-eyed on the couch , relapsing into suicidal fantasies . Live each day as your last , they say , but nobody in their right mind would try it . I reminded myself that it was Jason 's birthday tomorrow , that I was the only one  --  of the three of us  --  who knew how to bake a cake . The next afternoon I returned to the house and started getting ready for the party . We strung up balloons , and I bought party hats and noisemakers . Jason 's parents were supposed to arrive at three o'clock . At 2:45 , the phone rang and a woman 's voice drawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car was in the shop with brake trouble . " I 'm so sorry . I know Jason was expecting us . " " He 's waiting for his presents , " I said . She fumbled with the phone . " I ca n't tell you . We feel just awful about this . " " Look , we 'll just come over there . Give me your address . I 'll bring the cake and noisemakers . " An awkward pause . " Oh , no . Do n't trouble yourself . I mean , it 's too far a drive for them . They wo n't enjoy it . " " It 's no trouble , " I said loudly . " They love riding in the van . " It was a long ride on the freeway and we heard " Send in the Clowns " two times . Jason sat in the back , displaying none of his customary excitement at being on the road . " It 's your birthday , " I kept reminding him . When I told him we were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his head wilting like a sunflower . Eventually we found the exit and climbed a steep suburban street into some hills , rising above the great cloverleaf of the freeway into a development of newly built houses . I looked for some signs of recognition on Jason 's face , but then realized he may never have been there before . Jason 's parents greeted us at the door and invited us into the kitchen . Even though it was rainy season , they both had sunburns . Their faces were blank behind their smiles : I could have shaken them like an Etch A Sketch and made them disappear . The Kreighbaums seemed shy around their son , talking to him in special voices and exchanging covert looks . Mr. Kreighbaum wore a winded expression that emphasized the redness of his face , as if he 'd just completed a succession of cartwheels . He watched me empty the contents of the bag I 'd brought , peering at the party favors I laid out on the counter . The whole place made my teeth hurt . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a party hat , " I commanded Mr. Kreighbaum . " Oh , no . " He chuckled , glancing at his wife . " I do n't think it 'll fit . " " I promised Jason . " He took the little hat from my hand , sneaking a glimpse out the window before stretching the elastic cord around his chin . His head looked gigantic under the paper cone of the hat . We walked , wheeled , and staggered into the dining room and sat at the long oak table , which held a meager stack of presents . Mrs. Kreighbaum brought out plates of fruit salad and served us without speaking . I went to the kitchen and reentered with the cake , and we sang " Happy Birthday " to Jason , but he just sat there and refused to blow out his candles . His eyes were rheumy and distracted . I tried to cheer him up with a noisemaker , but he batted it from his face with one hook . " When 's the last time you 've seen Jason ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . " I do n't know . Gosh . " She turned her smile in my direction . " He seems so happy where he is . " " I 'm gon na open up a can of whup-ass , " Jason said . Mr. Kreighbaum tried to interest him in the presents , but he pushed them away with a listless shove . Undeterred , Mr. Kreighbaum opened up the biggest box on the table , feigning surprise at the contents . It was a plastic trout that flapped its tail when you came near it and sang " Take Me to the River . " You were supposed to hang it on the wall . Clearly , the resourceful man had run out to Walgreens before we got there and bought whatever he could find . He slid the toy from its box and laid it on the table to demonstrate . The trout was more convincing as an allegory of death , flapping its tail against the table and pleading for our mercy . Jason , incredibly , showed little interest . In the end Mr. Kreighbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table in his party hat , holding each toy up for our approval . Mrs. Kreighbaum  --  out of politeness , probably  --  tried to engage Dominic . " How 's the fruit salad ? " she asked . " Abyoola ! " " Amen on that , " I said to Dominic . " I agree with you one hundred percent . " Dominic asked where the bathroom was , and I had to repeat the question before Mrs. Kreighbaum would answer him . He lurched out of his chair . I thought he might knock something over , but he fumbled his way down the hall without disaster . Soon we could hear the yaaks and spits , the sounds of exultant retching . " It 's a masturbation thing , " I explained , trying to hide my elation . " He 's sexually frustrated . " About halfway through the presents , Jason got a sheepish , self-occupied look . The stench was tremendous . It was no illusion : we were working together . I let the Kreighbaums sit there for a while , watching them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groans . " Do you have any diapers ? " I asked eventually . Mrs. Kreighbaum shook her head . I went to get an Attends from the emergency stash in the van and threw the diaper in Mr. Kreighbaum 's lap . I asked him to change Jason in the bedroom , managing to bestow the task with a sense of honor . He glanced at his wife  --  a quick , despondent peek  --  and then looked at me pitifully . " I think Susie might be better equipped . " " He only lets men , " I said . " But I 'm his mother ! " Mrs. Kreighbaum said . " Please  --  this is no time to take things personally . " I turned to Mr. Kreighbaum . " Grab a bucket and some dish towels . You 'll need to wipe him down first . " He nodded . Clutching the Attends like a book , Mr. Kreighbaum stood up obediently and rummaged under the sink in the kitchen until he found an empty paint can . He held it up for approval and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the hall . The door closed behind them with an air of doom . Mrs. Kreighbaum and I picked at the remnants of our cake . Something about her face , the way it stared helplessly into her plate , gave me a twinge of guilt . Eventually the noises stopped and Dominic staggered back into the dining room , grinning from exhaustion , eyes glazed from the effort of his puking . He smiled at Mrs. Kreighbaum and said something I could n't decipher . She glanced at the closed door at the end of the hall , eyeing it with a look of canine longing . How hard was it to change a diaper ? I asked her to watch Dominic and then went down the hall to investigate . It was worse than I 'd expected . Jason , naked and white as a canvas , was curled up on the king-size bed , his ass and legs obscured by a painterly mess . Mr. Kreighbaum stood above him with sagging shoulders , hair thorned with sweat , holding a wet rag that was dripping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sticking out of the front of his forehead . He looked like a big , melanomic unicorn . There was shit on his hands and shirt and all over the denim comforter covering the bed . His hands trembled . He looked at me in despair , surrendering eagerly to defeat , like a refrigerator repairman asked to do an autopsy . I burned the image in my mind , savoring it while I could . I brushed Mr. Kreighbaum aside and cleaned Jason myself , changing his Attends and setting him carefully back in the wheelchair . He looked at his father and laughed out loud . " You 're cruising for a bruising ! " he said . He giggled all the way back to the dining room , his mood magically improved . Dominic , however , had disappeared . " I asked you to watch him ! " I said . Mrs. Kreighbaum clutched a chair . " I had to use the restroom . " I saw that she was crying . My teeth had stopped hurting , finally , but I did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dominic and found him standing by the curb across the street , bent over someone 's Jetta and peering through the window like a burglar . The dandruff in his hair sparkled in the sun . He turned to us with yearning , half-open eyes . " Red , " he mumbled . " My car for zoom . " " That 's not your car , " I said . " We 're at the wrong house completely . " On the way home , we stopped at Burger King for some Whoppers and sat next to an elderly woman with gigantic eyes filling her glasses . She watched Jason and Dominic maul their food , smiling in that special way when I caught her eye . " Children of God , " she whispered , leaning across her table and nodding seriously . I could n't suppress a laugh . Jason , who 'd been observing the scene with an amused look , tugged at my elbow . " What did she say ? " he asked . " She called you ' children of God . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's right , " I said , practically guffawing myself . The lady turned white . Dominic soon picked up on the joke and joined us in our laughter , gasping out wild , choking horselaughs , the three of us splitting our sides until we almost fell out of our seats . Occasionally , after my shift with Jason and Dominic , I 'd go to a bar on my street to get drunk . It was the kind of place with a neon martini glass for a name and an unsinkable turd floating in the toilet . Each time the same middle-age boat worker would buy me drinks . She cleaned yachts on the Willamette and her skin reeked of chemicals . Years in the sun had crumpled her face . She took classes at the hatha yoga center next door and was always waiting at the bar with her rolled-up mat , like a hobo . When she got drunk , she 'd stand on her head to prove she could drive . She was the only alcoholic yoga enthusiast I 'd ever met . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I work with some retards , " I said . " Right , " she said , commiserating . " I know what you mean . " After the fourth or fifth drink , I 'd wait until she went to the bathroom before escaping out into the night . In the mornings before work , I 'd take long strolls through the industrial streets of Portland , muttering to myself in a somnolent daze . I walked the same streets every day but never knew where I was . The fog hung in shreds ; I stepped through secret portals and found the sun . It was the fantasies  --  the suicide fog in my head  --  that I could n't step out of . The fact that I was going crazy crossed my mind more than once , but the beauty of the city distracted me , the ivy-covered walls and elegantly trussed bridges . In stores , I found it difficult to talk to people : my mouth floundered out a Dominic-style vowelese that made cashiers pull back in disgust . I felt like a visitor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you all right ? " someone asked when I was having trouble buying groceries . The little machine at the counter , and then the checkout girl herself , kept asking for my PIN number . I knew the PIN was my birth date , that was n't the problem . The problem was I could n't remember when I was born . " Of course not , " I said , losing patience . " You 're being ... rhetorical ? " The man stepped back . " I was trying to help . " " Look , you 're driving me up the wall . " I would weep for no reason , sometimes for hours . A physical condition . My heart was an onion making me cry . I started arriving earlier and earlier at Jason and Dominic 's , relieving other people before their shifts were done . Once , driving back from the movies , we passed by a long , sprawling cemetery bristling with tombstones . Jason seemed very interested in the graves , even the ones without balloons tied to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearview mirror . " Dead guys , " I explained . " Why ? " he said , staring out the window . " You mean why are they dead ? " I was impressed by his curiosity . " Excellent question . Superb . " I tried to think , a painful undertaking . " Maybe they were jealous of the dead people . I mean , when they were alive . They got tired of shitting themselves . You know , like an escape  --  except you go under the ground . " " Under the ground ? " He was grinning , though he seemed confused . " So what do they eat ? " " They 're just bones . They do n't know how to eat . " I thought he might be alarmed by this , but he found it very amusing . " They do n't know how to ... eat ? " he spat out , before convulsing with laughter . Dominic picked up on the joke , and the two of them giggled , trading smirks . Of course it was funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , I walked them to my car and showed them the Dixie cup of ashes in the glove box , explaining how the gray silt used to be a person . I thought they should know their alternatives . Dominic , in particular , greeted the idea with scorn . " No clean ! " he said . I handed the ashes to Jason , who thought they were meds and tried to lift them to his mouth . The next day we went to a coffee shop on Hawthorne Boulevard and ran into the boat worker who liked to buy me drinks . She stared at us as we ordered three lattes with straws in them . In the daylight , sitting by herself in the corner , she looked less toxic . I introduced her to Jason and Dominic , who were impressed by her gender . " Smell like blue ! " Dominic said , sniffing her fingers . " Cut it out , " I told him . " Blue water toilet ! " She looked at me , frowning . " These are your co-workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending it was n't true . Dominic touched her hair . I 'd forgotten her name and she told me , wincing a little . " Mensa ? " I said . " Like the whatever thing for geniuses ? " She shrugged . " My mom liked the sound of it . " I took her back to Jason and Dominic 's , showed her the house where I spent most of my time . She burped for their entertainment and let Dominic hold her breast . We were n't used to having visitors and kept looking at ourselves in the mirror above the filing cabinet . After a little while , Mensa got up and started flipping through the cupboards in the kitchen . " Do n't they have anything to drink in this house ? " she asked . " I do n't think that 's one of their patterns of survival . " " Great . What about us ? " Later , we retreated to Jason 's Flex-A-Bed while he and Dominic watched a video in the living room . Mensa 's face was stitched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tight and curled my legs into her stomach . Dinosaurs roared in the background . She tried to interest me in other things , which annoyed me : I wanted to be clutched . I 'd heard about a machine , invented by an autistic person , that would clench you in a giant rubber hand for as long as you needed . " You 're the most miserable lover I 've ever had , " she said , probing her nostril with a finger . She picked her nose without embarrassment , as if she were enjoying a cigarette . " So I hear . " " No . I mean , I thought I had problems . " She started coming over in the afternoons , showing up after work in her coveralls . She had a flask with a golf ball on it that she 'd stolen from one of the yachts she worked on . We 'd fold together in Jason 's bed and clutch each other until my arm went numb . The sweat in her hair smelled like Dra'no . I did n't deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one had bothered to let her know . Afterward , she 'd do yoga on the front lawn in the mizzling rain , lying on her back and then lifting herself slowly into an arch , like a demolition shown in reverse . The poses had mysterious names : Downward Dog , Sun Salute . Once I found her lying on the grass in a random-looking sprawl , the palms of her hands turned up to the drizzle . " The Corpse , " she explained later . " Feels wonderful . " Two months after visiting his parents , Jason had a grand mal seizure . It happened on the morning shift , but I got there in time to catch the paramedics loading his exhausted body into the ambulance , to see the gaunt perplexity of his face . We had a special employee meeting , and the Care Services Coordinator warned us Jason could die on anyone 's shift ; he 'd already lived past his projected life span . The house was lonely without him , and I wondered if his parents were visiting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed wan and listless . I changed his mess like always , but he did n't giggle or stick his tongue in my ear . When I tried to teach him some new cliches , he just stared at me with a drifting face . His mother started dropping by now and then , treating me like a servant now that she was in her son 's house . She read picture books to Jason while I cooked Hamburger Helper or prepared his meds . She always left after thirty minutes , mid-book , when she 'd appeased her guilt for hoping he would die . His father never came . To cheer him up , I brought Mensa to the house . She burped at Jason  --  his favorite trick  --  but he just stared at her without laughing . Then he rolled his eyes to the wall , trapped in a dream . Dominic sat on the front steps as usual , staring resolutely down the street with his hands folded in his lap , like a millennialist awaiting the Rapture . He 'd sit there for a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . I felt a breathless envy that made me sick . " You think he 'd give a shit that his roommate 's dying , " I said . " Probably it does n't mean anything to him , " Mensa said . " Life and death . " I went outside and interrupted Dominic 's vigil . " Red car ! " he said , jumping up . " Fastest car ! " " Dominic , will you shut up ? " He was excited and tottering . I had to grip his shoulders to steady him . " There 's no car coming . " " Red car go zoom ! " " Dominic , listen to me ! " " Fabulous car ! " " You 're not going to win anything ! " I said , shaking him . His head flopped back and forth . " Ca n't you get that through your thick skull ? " Jason never went back to his original self . He sat in the back of the van and saved himself for special occasions , shouting out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a hippie . He lost his sense of schadenfreude during movies and stopped guffawing when someone was killed or eaten . When we passed the cemetery now , he stared out the window and eyed it suspiciously . " Dead people , " he said . His mouth changed at the corners , but I could n't tell if it was a smirk or a frown . " Yep . " I knew what was coming . " They do n't know how to eat . " " That 's right , " I said cheerfully . " They 're too stupid . " " We 're smarter than them , " he whispered with his head bowed , like a wish . Mensa and I found a cheap body shop on Burnside and took my Subaru in for a paint job . I 'd saved enough  --  using my dad 's Mobil card on daily necessities  --  to pay for it . When the car was finished , we drove to the house and parked it on the curb . I brought Dominic outside with a blindfold on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on his head . He stood there for a minute , rubbing his eyes . Except in the movies , I 'd never seen anyone rub their eyes in astonishment  --  but he actually put his fists to his eyes and ground them into the sockets . " Red car , " he said finally . He was stock-still on the sidewalk , the only time I 'd seen him stand in one place without swaying like a mast . " My car win ! " " There 's no room in the garage , " I told him . " I 'll have to keep it for you . " We took him for a test drive , speeding into not a through roads and startling neighbors . Back at the house , Mensa and I escaped to the bedroom . Dominic 's excitement had gone to my head ; I tried my best to emulate him , to imagine what he 'd do in my situation . We lay in bed and I touched her breast through her coveralls , breathing in her scent . I was trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much struggle . Her body was smooth and white , a distant memory of her face . I was still clothed , luckily , when we heard someone pull up the driveway . The donors . I 'd forgotten all about them . I looked at Mensa , who was lying next to me in her underthings . " They 're here to take a tour . " " Now ? " she said . " You mean , like , immediately ? " " Stay here , " I told her . I shut her in the bedroom and went out to greet the donors , who were dressed in business clothes and inspecting the front azalea beds . These were the people , the guilty rich , who gave the agency money . I introduced them to Jason , who told them they were treading on thin ice and went back to his movie depicting the end of the world . I gave them a quick tour of the house , careful to avoid the bedroom . Just as I was leading them outside , Dominic returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapes and bruises . " He 's bleeding ! " the man said to me . " It 's normal . He 's a hemophiliac . " " You mean he ca n't stop ? Should n't he go to the hospital ? " I laughed . " It 's not that kind of hemophilia , thank God ! " Dominic smiled triumphantly from under his helmet . I clapped him on the back and the donors relaxed , touched by our camaraderie . The man wanted to see the backyard . I tried to distract him with a description of Jason 's and Dominic 's more inspirational qualities , but he insisted on visiting the garden where " the residents had planted tomatoes . " Probably it was the benchmark by which he gauged whether his money was being well spent . I led them toward the backyard , but when I reached the lawn I turned around and saw them standing in the middle of the brick path , transfixed by something in the house . They were staring at Mensa through the sliding glass doors of the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hunched there in the center of the room , her face frozen into a spectral frown . " I thought there were only two , " the man said . " Moved in last week , " I explained . She stared at us through the glass . Then she started to skulk back and forth , pushing her lips out from her face so they touched her nose . She stopped and picked up one of her cowboy boots from the floor , gnawing on it like a steak . " What 's she doing ? " the woman asked reverently , leaning in my ear . " One of our sadder cases  --  does n't leave the bedroom . " Later , when we 'd completed the tour , they shook Jason 's and Dominic 's hands , and the three of us accompanied them to their car . They seemed touched . They took a Polaroid of us in front of the house  --  a " family photo , " the man called it  --  and we watched in astonishment as our faces stained the picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said . " Your parents must be proud . " That was the first day of July . Spring wound down into Portland 's nicest time of year . The clouds broke and the city revealed itself for the first time , the great river shining in the sun . The river stayed in your eyes when you looked somewhere else . Mensa spent long hours on the lawn , transforming herself into beautiful shapes . It was like an ancient kind of alphabet . Jason , Dominic , and I crowded near the window , wondering what she was writing . We watched her rise on her forearms and swing her body over her head in the form of a scorpion . One day , she asked me outside to join her . I took off my shoes and followed her onto the lawn , feeling the warmth of grass between my toes . She taught me poses , whichever occurred to her at the moment : the Warrior , the Cobra , the Up-Facing Dog . As I warped my body into shapes , I had the sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mensa and I sprawled on the grass and closed our eyes without moving  --  for what seemed like forever . Then we stood up and she showed me how to salute the sun . Later , we decided to take the red-painted Subaru out for a spin . I told Dominic that I had to do the driving , at least until he got a license , but that he could help me steer if he wanted . Jason lay across the backseat , his head propped on Mensa 's lap . She stroked his hair and named what we passed . " Fire hydrant , " she said . " Anarchists . " I started out slowly but then picked up speed on the highway , cranking the easy-listening station as loud as it would go . It was like old times . I let Dominic have the wheel and he honked at two women in a Jeep , sure of his irresistible allure . We drove out to the country , where the radio went static . The cows moped around like ghosts . When we stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . On the way back , a gust rose from the fields and an old sign lifted out of the bed of a dump truck in front of us , held aloft by the wind . It sailed toward us in slow motion , levitating over the highway . free delivery , it said . I almost shut my eyes . Instead , I veered out of the way and lost control of the wheel . We rocked into a ditch on the side of the road , the glove box flying open in a puff of gray powder . The four of us bounced in our seats . A second wind whipped through the Subaru and vanished into silence . Our faces were dusted with ash . " Crazy idiot ! " Mensa said  --  to the dump truck , I suppose . " We 're alive , " I said . " That 's what 's important . " " Alive ? " Jason asked . We stared at each other , hearts pounding , and then I started the car again and headed for home . Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
