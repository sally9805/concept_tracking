Section : ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE NEWS SPECIAL REPORT These therapies may need more lab time , but so far , the buzz is hopeful <p> Copper reduction . Macrobiotic diets . Cytoluminescent ( light ) therapy from Ireland . These were among the exciting cancer treatments on the docket at a conference presented by the Center for Integrative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital . The event drew scores of healers and even a few cancer patients to Philadelphia one recent weekend . Here are the discussions I found especially riveting . Control copper , Control tumors ? <p> One of the major goals in cancer research is to figure out how to stymie the growth of the new blood vessels ( called angiogenesis ) that feed tumors . Shutting down , or at least retarding , this growth has been recognized as a major cancer control factor since the early 1970s . <p> George J. Brewer , MD , the Morton and Henrietta K. Sellner emeritus professor of human genetics and emeritus professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan , is the man who conquered Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with toxic levels of copper , is fatal if left untreated . Dr Brewer and his team developed a safe , inexpensive drug called tetrathiomolybdate ( TM for short ) , which lowers copper levels to normal . It is now on track to become an FDA-approved treatment for Wilson 's disease . <p> Aware that copper is key to the angiogenesis process , Dr. Brewer conducted research to see whether TM could safely reduce copper in people with cancer . His hunch paid off , and now Dr. Brewer and his team are studying whether reducing copper by using TM will affect advanced-stage cancer . <p> I asked Dr. Brewer to look into his crystal ball about the future of TM therapy . <p> " The early studies suggest that , used alone , TM has excellent potential to prevent the growth of micrometastatic clinically undetectable cancer that migrates from a primary tumor to other sites disease . I believe it will also be useful in helping prevent cancer in people who are at high risk for developing it . " <p> What 's more , notes Dr. Brewer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce tumor burden to prevent cancer 's recurrence . Diet Key to " Miracle " Recovery ? <p> Kushi macrobiotics ( KM ) is a longevity-enhancing lifestyle that promotes a largely organic , vegetarian diet . Developed by Michio Kushi , founder of the Kushi Institute in Becket , MA , the KM program has captivated some cancer researchers with several dramatic , well-documented recoveries from end-stage Cancers . <p> George W. Yu , MD , clinical professor of urology at George Washington University Medical Center , presented six cases of people with terminal cancer ( pancreatic , melanoma , lung , breast , and lymphoma ) . Within 3 to 6 months of beginning a macrobiotic program , every patient 's tumor shrank , becoming invisible on x-rays . They have lived , on average , 15.8 years after their " terminal " diagnoses . <p> To what do these survivors owe their miracle recoveries ? Dr. Yu is n't sure , but he sees a link between losing visceral ( " inside the belly " ) fat and tumor regression . Most people who go on macrobiotic diets lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizes whole grains and vegetables . Or maybe it 's the miso , an ingredient in many macrobiotic recipes ; it contains 4,000 molds , 6,000 yeasts , and millions of helpful bacteria with detoxifying and immune-stimulating effects , says Dr. Yu . <p> The jury 's out , but answers are expected from an anticipated National Cancer Institute trial . <p> Despite its benefits , a macrobiotic diet is n't for everyone , says Dr. Yu . Patients must be highly disciplined and follow the program strictly . Support from family and your physician is essential . Irish Light Treatment <p> As a cancer treatment , photodynamic light therapy ( PDT ) has been around for nearly 100 years . But doctors in Ireland have pioneered a new variation called Cytoluminescent Therapy ( CLT ) . <p> Both therapies involve two steps . First , patients get a drug that renders cancer cells vulnerable to light . Then , a special light treatment destroys just the cancer cells , leaving healthy cells untouched . <p> In PDT treatments , the drug that caused the light sensitivity made people so light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . CLT , on the other hand , uses a plant-based drug that 's said to be much gentler . Cancer patients are getting measurably successful results from the innovative treatment , says Ralph Moss , PhD , founder of Cancer Decisions , a newsletter and Web site for people with cancer . <p> Currently , there are no published studies on CLT , although patients who are treated with CLT in Ireland will be enrolled in a pilot study to collect data for consideration as a " best case series " in hopes of getting funding for clinical trials . <p> Dr. Moss reported that he spent 2 weeks in Ireland , reviewed more than 100 cases , and spoke to dozens of patients , whose results amazed him .
