<p> TEGUCIGALPA , HONDURAS - A reputed killer and leader of one of the world 's most notorious street gangs escaped during a botched custody transfer in Honduras and has been a fugitive for more than a year , the Houston Chronicle has learned . <p> Ever Anibal Rivera Paz , the alleged chief of the Honduran arm of the Mara Salvatrucha gang , was being extradited on charges of plotting a massacre that left 28 people , including six children , dead on Dec. 23 , 2004 . <p> Also known as " El Culiche , " The Tapeworm , Rivera Paz was last seen boarding a deportation flight from Houston to Honduras on Nov. 17 , 2005 , according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement records . <p> The FBI fears Rivera Paz may have returned to the United States or may be headed that way , according to a confidential May 2006 FBI bulletin obtained by the Chronicle . <p> " Officers should be aware that he has threatened to assassinate any officer that attempts to apprehend him , " the bulletin states . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never notified that he was scheduled for deportation . <p> U.S. immigration officials insisted that the Honduran government was notified in writing through multiple channels that " Culiche " was headed back after a stint in a U.S. prison for re-entering the country illegally . <p> " I do n't want to blame anybody , " said Oscar Alvarez , former security minister for Honduras , " but somebody did n't do his job . " <p> Nine months before Rivera Paz disappeared , top FBI officials and then-President of Honduras Ricardo Marduro called news conferences to announce his capture . He was arrested by a Texas state trooper near Falfurrias on Feb. 10 , 2005 , after a traffic stop about 110 miles from the border . <p> Twelve days after the arrest , U.S. officials matched Rivera Paz to a Department of Homeland Security alert , based on Honduran intelligence , that warned he could be heading north to avoid prosecution in the massacre . His arrest was called a major blow to Mara Salvatrucha , or MS-13 , and a model of international cooperation . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case has raised serious questions about security procedures in both countries and about the integrity of the deportation process . <p> U.S. and Honduran officials could not , or would not , explain exactly how he escaped . <p> When the alleged MS-13 leader was deported , " nobody advised anybody " that he was coming home , said Alvarez , now the vice consul in Houston . The problem was n't just on the U.S. side , he added , conceding that Hondurans also failed to catch his arrival . <p> Luisa Deason , an ICE spokeswoman in Houston , said U.S. authorities notified the Honduran government that Rivera Paz would be deported that day . She said ICE listed his name on a roster of deportees arriving in Honduras who had criminal records in the United States . The Honduran government also issued travel papers for Rivera Paz , she said , clearing the way for his deportation . <p> " We executed that removal order and turned everyone on that flight over to the government , " Deason said . " If there 's a question after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask that government . " <p> The international law enforcement organization Interpol has reissued a lookout for Rivera Paz , who is described as extremely dangerous . " <p> On the night of the 2004 massacre , Alvarez arrived at the crime scene to coordinate the manhunt for the assailants , who had ambushed a crowded bus . <p> There were bodies in the road , blood on the bus steps . The killers left a note on the front windshield decrying a government proposal to legalize the death penalty as part of a crackdown on gangs . <p> " I do n't want to remember , " he said . " It was a terrorist attack . " <p> At 7:15 p.m. , an old , yellow Ford bus headed along a dirt road that runs through Chamelecon , a poor suburb of San Pedro Sula in northern Honduras . The bus was packed with 56 people , factory workers and last-minute Christmas shoppers , some standing in the aisle . <p> Witnesses said a truck and a car pulled out of the darkness , forcing the bus to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started shooting from outside the bus , the witnesses said , and then moved up the steps . <p> " People were screaming , and the more they screamed in the bus , the more they shot , " said a teenage factory worker who was shot 16 times . <p> Alvarez said witnesses on the bus identified one of the gunmen as Rivera Paz . They said he was carrying an M-16 rifle . <p> Oldin Alexander Rodriguez , a young father , was in the 13th row with his wife and their baby , Isaac . <p> It was dark on the bus , he said . So dark he never saw a thing . But he heard people screaming and dropping to the floor . <p> He wrapped his hulking body around his wife , Glenda Yaqueline Ramos , who pulled Isaac into her lap . She shielded him with her knees , her arms and her head . She tried not to scream . <p> When international travelers - tourists , missionaries and business travelers - arrive at the newly remodeled airport in Tegucigalpa , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asked to show their passports . They put their right , then left , index fingers on a digital scanner . They look up at the camera to have their retinas scanned . <p> It 's different for Hondurans deported from the U.S. <p> They are corralled into a low-slung , beige building off the runway . There is no fingerprint scanner . The recent arrivals fill out forms with their names , ages and dates of birth . The paperwork is filed away in three-ring binders by date of arrival . <p> Honduran immigration officials said they are poorly equipped to deal with a record influx of deportees from the U.S. , more than 24,000 in 2006 . They do n't have money to provide new arrivals with diapers for their babies , much less to hire more staff , said Rosario Murillo , with the Center for Attention to the Returned Migrant . <p> The system is chaotic . Sometimes the office gets a list of deported criminals , Murillo said , but sometimes it does not . A roster of deported criminals that ICE passed along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people accused of offenses including illegal re-entry and sex crimes . <p> Jorge Bustillo Rivera , who is in charge of fugitive captures for Interpol in Tegucigalpa , reviews the names on the U.S. flight rosters , checks for outstanding warrants in Honduras and tries to detect deportees using aliases . <p> But Bustillo said he also has to juggle a workload that grows by eight to 10 fugitive cases daily . The nearest FBI office is in El Salvador . <p> " We do n't have the necessary resources to do the job right , " Bustillo said . <p> Rivera Paz must have known the drill when the plane landed on Nov. 17 , 2005 . <p> It was his fifth deportation flight . <p> No one 's sure how long the bus attack lasted that night . Some passengers said two minutes . Others said five . <p> Alexander , the young father , was shot in the leg and side . The bullets ricocheted around inside his torso . <p> His 23-year-old wife felt his body go limp . She panicked and raised herself up , screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hit again , and stopped moving . <p> Alexander regained consciousness but still saw nothing , he said . He heard a stranger 's voice , one of the attackers , moving methodically through the bus . The gunman paused over people who were still breathing , Alexander recalls . He 'd ask , " Are you still alive ? " Then he would shoot . <p> Alexander checked on his family . His wife still was n't moving . The baby in her lap was covered in blood . <p> U.S. investigators described Rivera Paz as intelligent , articulate and highly mobile . They said he uses different birth dates but is thought to be about 31 . <p> He carries fake IDs , uses multiple cell phones and has 38 known aliases , according to Honduran authorities and the FBI . He has a number of nicknames in addition to " The Tapeworm , " including The Little Baby . " <p> An early member of the Normandie Locos , a particularly violent Los Angeles-based clique , Rivera Paz 's criminal history dates to the early 1990s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accused of drug trafficking , aggravated assault , burglary , using fake IDs , writing bad checks and driving without a license , according to federal law enforcement sources . <p> But most of the serious charges were dropped or sealed in his juvenile record . His convictions in the U.S. were relatively minor : misdemeanor burglary in San Francisco , false representation to a police officer in Los Angeles and giving law enforcement a fake ID in San Luis Obispo . He served 13 days in jail in California in 2001 , according to his federal court complaint . <p> Rivera Paz was deported twice in 1996 , once in 1997 and again in 2001 . <p> In 2003 , he was arrested in Comayagua , Honduras , allegedly with 19 marijuana joints , 29 baggies of cocaine and an AK-47 in his possession , according to Honduran court records . The documents also referred to an outstanding warrant in two murders in 2003 in Comayagua , allegedly of a woman and teenager who wanted out of the gang . The disposition of those cases was unclear . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his associates of hiring out their services as kidnappers , drug traffickers and hit men . <p> " These gangs in Honduras are n't just gangs anymore , " Bustillo said . They 're linked to organized crime . " <p> According to Honduran court records , Rivera Paz claimed to have retired from the gang life after his mother died , telling the judge , " I declare myself innocent of everything . " <p> On Aug. 17 , 2004 , he and two other inmates allegedly broke out of a prison in Comayagua , beating and severely injuring a guard in the process , according to Interpol . <p> It was in that picturesque , colonial town that the MS-13 leaders reportedly plotted the massacre . <p> Honduran investigators said they 've identified seven suspects directly involved and 24 with possible knowledge of it . They still call Rivera Paz the mastermind behind the attack . <p> A handful of Rivera Paz 's alleged accomplices are on trial in San Pedro Sula . <p> After Rivera Paz 's arrest in South Texas , he went before a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawfully re-entering the country . He pleaded guilty . <p> On July 8 , 2005 , U.S. District Court Judge David Hittner sentenced him to seven months in prison - in line with federal sentencing guidelines . Much of his federal court file remains sealed . <p> When he appeared before the judge , Rivera Paz said : " Please , send me back to my own country to pay for the crimes I caused there . " <p> On Christmas Day 2004 , the families of Chamelecon buried their dead , including 16 women and six children . One of the women was three months pregnant . <p> There are still questions about the motives behind the massacre . Some are convinced it was a gesture of defiance against Honduran authorities . Others say it was revenge against a rival gang . <p> In their tin-roofed house on the outskirts of San Pedro Sula , Alexander gently tucks a stray hair behind Yaqueline 's ear , on the side of her head that she ca n't reach because of her injuries . Their son , Isaac , now 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear . " <p> Yaqueline pushes her wheelchair with her good arm , the strong one . <p> She is not expected to walk again . <p> A while ago , the prosecutor in the trial of the other MS-13 members came by their house . He was looking for witnesses . <p> " I told him , we did n't see a thing , " Alexander said . <p> Yaqueline nodded . <p> " It was so dark . I did n't see a thing .
