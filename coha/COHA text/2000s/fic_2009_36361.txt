The Coming <p> After eight months spent in the obscurity of our mother 's womb , my brother , Shiva , and I came into the world in the late afternoon of the twentieth of September in the year of grace 1954 . We took our first breaths at an elevation of eight thousand feet in the thin air of Addis Ababa , capital city of Ethiopia . The miracle of our birth took place in Missing Hospital 's Operating Theater 3 , the very room where our mother , Sister Mary Joseph Praise , spent most of her working hours , and in which she had been most fulfilled . <p> When our mother , a nun of the Diocesan Carmelite Order of Madras , unexpectedly went into labor that September morning , the big rain in Ethiopia had ended , its rattle on the corrugated tin roofs of Missing ceasing abruptly like a chatterbox cut off in midsentence . Over night , in that hushed silence , the meskel flowers bloomed , turning the hillsides of Addis Ababa into gold . In the meadows around Missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant carpet now swept right up to the paved threshold of the hospital , holding forth the promise of something more substantial than cricket , croquet , or shuttlecock . <p> Missing sat on a verdant rise , the irregular cluster of whitewashed one- and two-story buildings looking as if they were pushed up from the ground in the same geologic rumble that created the Entoto Mountains . Troughlike flower beds , fed by the runoff from the roof gutters , surrounded the squat buildings like a moat . Matron Hirst 's roses overtook the walls , the crimson blooms framing every window and reaching to the roof . So fertile was that loamy soil that Matron-Missing Hospital 's wise and sensible leader-cautioned us against stepping into it barefoot lest we sprout new toes . <p> Five trails flanked by shoulder-high bushes ran away from the main hospital buildings like spokes of a wheel , leading to five thatched-roof bungalows that were all but hidden by copse , by hedgerows , by wild eucalyptus and pine . It was Matron 's intent that Missing resemble an arboretum , or a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , she used to walk as a young nun ) , or Eden before the Fall . <p> Missing was really Mission Hospital , a word that on the Ethiopian tongue came out with a hiss so it sounded like " Missing . " A clerk in the Ministry of Health who was a fresh high-school graduate had typed out the missing hospital on the license , a phonetically correct spelling as far as he was concerned . A reporter for the Ethiopian Herald perpetuated this misspelling . When Matron Hirst had approached the clerk in the ministry to correct this , he pulled out his original typescript . " See for yourself , madam . Quod erat demonstrandum it is Missing , " he said , as if he 'd proved Pythagoras 's theorem , the sun 's central position in the solar system , the roundness of the earth , and Missing 's precise location at its imagined corner . And so Missing it was . <p> Not a cry or a groan escaped from Sister Mary Joseph Praise while in the throes of her cataclysmic labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operating Theater 3 , the oversize autoclave ( donated by the Lutheran church in Zurich ) bellowed and wept for my mother while its scalding steam sterilized the surgical instruments and towels that would be used on her . After all , it was in the corner of the autoclave room , right next to that stainless-steel behemoth , that my mother kept a sanctuary for herself during the seven years she spent at Missing before our rude arrival . Her one-piece desk-and-chair , rescued from a defunct mission school , and bearing the gouged frustration of many a pupil , faced the wall . Her white cardigan , which I am told she often slipped over her shoulders when she was between operations , lay over the back of the chair . <p> On the plaster above the desk my mother had tacked up a calendar print of Bernini 's famous sculpture of St. Teresa of Avila . The figure of St. Teresa lies limp , as if in a faint , her lips parted in ecstasy , her eyes unfocused , lids half closed . On either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a faint smile and a body more muscular than befits his youthful face , a boy angel stands over the saintly , voluptuous sister . The fingertips of his left hand lift the edge of the cloth covering her bosom . In his right hand he holds an arrow as delicately as a violinist holds a bow . <p> Why this picture ? Why St. Teresa , Mother ? <p> As a little boy of four , I took myself away to this windowless room to study the image . Courage alone could not get me past that heavy door , but my sense that she was there , my obsession to know the nun who was my mother , gave me strength . I sat next to the autoclave which rumbled and hissed like a waking dragon , as if the hammering of my heart had roused the beast . Gradually , as I sat at my mother 's desk , a peace would come over me , a sense of communion with her . <p> I learned later that no one had dared remove her cardigan from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacred object . But for a four-year-old , everything is sacred and ordinary . I pulled that Cuticura-scented garment around my shoulders . I rimmed the dried-out inkpot with my nail , tracing a path her fingers had taken . Gazing up at the calendar print just as she must have while sitting there in that windowless room , I was transfixed by that image . Years later , I learned that St. Teresa 's recurrent vision of the angel was called the transverberation , which the dictionary said was the soul " inflamed " by the love of God , and the heart " pierced " by divine love ; the metaphors of her faith were also the metaphors of medicine . At four years of age , I did n't need words like " transverberation " to feel reverence for that image . Without photographs of her to go by , I could n't help but imagine that the woman in the picture was my mother , threatened and about to be ravished by the spear-wielding boy-angel . " When are you coming , Mama ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile . When are you coming ? <p> I would whisper my answer : " By God ! " That was all I had to go by : Dr. Ghosh 's declaration the time I 'd first wandered in there and he 'd come looking for me and had stared at the picture of St. Teresa over my shoulders ; he lifted me in his strong arms and said in that voice of his that was every bit a match for the autoclave : " She is CUM-MING , by God ! " <p> Forty-six and four years have passed since my birth , and miraculously I have the opportunity to return to that room . I find I am too large for that chair now , and the cardigan sits atop my shoulders like the lace amice of a priest . But chair , cardigan , and calendar print of transverberation are still there . I , Marion Stone , have changed , but little else has . Being in that unaltered room propels a thumbing back through time and memory . The unfading print of Bernini 's statue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what my mother tacked up ) seems to demand this . I am forced to render some order to the events of my life , to say it began here , and then because of this , that happened , and this is how the end connects to the beginning , and so here I am . <p> We come unbidden into this life , and if we are lucky we find a purpose beyond starvation , misery , and early death which , lest we forget , is the common lot . I grew up and I found my purpose and it was to become a physician . My intent was n't to save the world as much as to heal myself . <p> Few doctors will admit this , certainly not young ones , but subconsciously , in entering the profession , we must believe that ministering to others will heal our woundedness . And it can . But it can also deepen the wound . <p> I chose the specialty of surgery because of Matron , that steady presence during my boyhood and adolescence . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when I went to her for advice on the darkest day of the first half of my life . I squirmed . How easily Matron probed the gap between ambition and expediency . " Why must I do what is hardest ? " <p> " Because , Marion , you are an instrument of God . Do n't leave the instrument sitting in its case , my son . Play ! Leave no part of your instrument unexplored . Why settle for ' Three Blind Mice ' when you can play the ' Gloria ' ? " <p> How unfair of Matron to evoke that soaring chorale which always made me feel that I stood with every mortal creature looking up to the heavens in dumb wonder . She understood my unformed character . <p> " But , Matron , I ca n't dream of playing Bach , the ' Gloria ' ... , " I said under my breath . I 'd never played a string or wind instrument . I could n't read music . <p> " No , Marion , " she said , her gaze soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cheeks . " No , not Bach 's ' Gloria . ' Yours ! Your ' Gloria ' lives within you . The greatest sin is not finding it , ignoring what God made possible in you . " <p> I was temperamentally better suited to a cognitive discipline , to an introspective field-internal medicine , or perhaps psychiatry . The sight of the operating theater made me sweat . The idea of holding a scalpel caused coils to form in my belly . ( It still does . ) Surgery was the most difficult thing I could imagine . <p> And so I became a surgeon . <p> Thirty years later , I am not known for speed , or daring , or technical genius . Call me steady , call me plodding ; say I adopt the style and technique that suits the patient and the particular situation and I 'll consider that high praise . I take heart from my fellow physicians who come to me when they themselves must suffer the knife . They know that Marion Stone will be as involved after the surgery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for surgical aphorisms such as " When in doubt , cut it out " or " Why wait when you can operate " other than for how reliably they reveal the shallowest intellects in our field . My father , for whose skills as a surgeon I have the deepest respect , says , " The operation with the best outcome is the one you decide not to do . " Knowing when not to operate , knowing when I am in over my head , knowing when to call for the assistance of a surgeon of my father 's caliber-that kind of talent , that kind of " brilliance , " goes unheralded . <p> On one occasion with a patient in grave peril , I begged my father to operate . He stood silent at the bedside , his fingers lingering on the patient 's pulse long after he had registered the heart rate , as if he needed the touch of skin , the thready signal in the radial artery to catalyze his decision . In his taut expression I saw complete concentration . I imagined I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the shimmer of tears in his eyes . With utmost care he weighed one option against another . At last , he shook his head , and turned away . <p> I followed . " Dr. Stone , " I said , using his title though I longed to cry out , Father ! " An operation is his only chance , " I said . In my heart I knew the chance was infinitesimally small , and the first whiff of anesthesia might end it all . My father put his hand on my shoulder . He spoke to me gently , as if to a junior colleague rather than his son . " Marion , remember the Eleventh Commandment , " he said . " Thou shall not operate on the day of a patient 's death . " <p> I remember his words on full-moon nights in Addis Ababa when knives are flashing and rocks and bullets are flying , and when I feel as if I am standing in an abattoir and not in Operating Theater 3 , my skin flecked with the grist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always know the answers before you operate . One operates in the now . Later , the retrospectoscope , that handy tool of the wags and pundits , the conveners of the farce we call M&amp;M-morbidity and mortality conference-will pronounce your decision right or wrong . Life , too , is like that . You live it forward , but understand it backward . It is only when you stop and look to the rear that you see the corpse caught under your wheel . <p> Now , in my fiftieth year , I venerate the sight of the abdomen or chest laid open . I 'm ashamed of our human capacity to hurt and maim one another , to desecrate the body . Yet it allows me to see the cabalistic harmony of heart peeking out behind lung , of liver and spleen consulting each other under the dome of the diaphragm-these things leave me speechless . My fingers " run the bowel " looking for holes that a blade or bullet might have created , coil after glistening coil , twenty-three feet of it compacted into such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers like this in the African night would by now reach the Cape of Good Hope , and I have yet to see the serpent 's head . But I do see the ordinary miracles under skin and rib and muscle , visions concealed from their owner . Is there a greater privilege on earth ? <p> At such moments I remember to thank my twin brother , Shiva-Dr . Shiva Praise Stone-to seek him out , to find his reflection in the glass panel that separates the two operating theaters , and to nod my thanks because he allows me to be what I am today . A surgeon . According to Shiva , life is in the end about fixing holes . Shiva did n't speak in metaphors . Fixing holes is precisely what he did . Still , it 's an apt metaphor for our profession . But there 's another kind of hole , and that is the wound that divides family . Sometimes this wound occurs at the moment of birth , sometimes it happens later . We are all fixing what is broken . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much unfinished for the next generation . <p> Born in Africa , living in exile in America , then returning at last to Africa , I am proof that geography is destiny . Destiny has brought me back to the precise coordinates of my birth , to the very same operating theater where I was born . My gloved hands share the space above the table in Operating Theater 3 that my mother and father 's hands once occupied . <p> Some nights the crickets cry zaa-zee , zaa-zee , thousands of them drowning out the coughs and grunts of the hyenas in the hillsides . Suddenly , nature turns quiet . It is as if roll call is over and it is time now in the darkness to find your mate and retreat . In the ensuing vacuum of silence , I hear the high-pitched humming of the stars and I feel exultant , thankful for my insignificant place in the galaxy . It is at such times that I feel my indebtedness to Shiva . <p> Twin brothers , we slept in the same bed till our teens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We outgrew that intimacy , but I still long for it , for the proximity of his skull . When I wake to the gift of yet another sunrise , my first thought is to rouse him and say , I owe you the sight of morning . <p> What I owe Shiva most is this : to tell the story . It is one my mother , Sister Mary Joseph Praise , did not reveal and my fearless father , Thomas Stone , ran from , and which I had to piece together . Only the telling can heal the rift that separates my brother and me . Yes , I have infinite faith in the craft of surgery , but no surgeon can heal the kind of wound that divides two brothers . Where silk and steel fail , story must succeed . To begin at the beginning ... <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
