Facing Maj. Gen. George Washington 's army at Assunpink Creek on January 2 , 1777 , Lt. Gen. Charles Cornwallis expected to " bag the fox " the following day but the next morning brought an unpleasant surprise-the fox had vanished . // General George Washington is placed inaccurately near at hand in John Trumbull 's painting of The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton , Januarys , 1777 ( Francis G.

" So wrote Major General George Washington to Robert Morris , George Clymer and George Walton in a letter from his headquarters on New Year 's Day , 1777 . Washington was intent on following up his victory over the British army 's Hessian contingent at Trenton on December 26 , 1776 . But time was against him . The enlistments of most of his men had expired at midnight on December 31 , and it would take money , morale building and all Washington 's dignity to keep them any longer . Before the victory at Trenton , Washington 's Continental Army had been on the verge of disintegration . Washington himself remembered the humiliation of having his men pushed off Harlem Heights while a British bugler played a fox hunting call . ( " It seemed to crown our disgrace , " noted one of his aides . ) Following his calculated gamble of doubling back across the Delaware River to surprise the Hessians at Trenton the day after Christmas , Washington felt that the cards were in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Washington 's troops were starving . There was a rumor that a chest with 70,000 pounds sterling in it resided on the British side of the river . Washington was not about to discourage such a rumor , with the proviso that it would be better if such a chest were in American hands . Washington had already ordered that " the sum that is lodged at Ticonderoga " be brought down from the Northern Department . But that would take time-something he did not have , especially if he was to land a crushing blow . He had told Congress-and would tell it again-of his need for food and supplies , but it could not provide them . In a last-ditch effort , he had called upon the personal fortunes of friends for much-needed pay and provisions . The two parcels of money ( for both his soldiers and his spies ) from Morris , Clymer and Walton had arrived just in time . " At this trying time , " a sergeant in his camp re-called , " General Washington , having now but a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could place but little confidence , ordered our regiment to be paraded and personally addressed us , urging that we should stay a month longer . He alluded to our recent victory at Trenton , told us that our services were greatly needed , and that we could now do more for our country than we ever could at any future period , and in the most affectionate manner entreated us to stay . The drums beat for volunteers , but not a man turned out . The soldiers worn down from fatigue and privations , had their hearts fixed on home and the comforts of the domestic circle , and it was hard to forego the anticipated pleasures of the society of our dearest friends . " The General wheeled his horse about , rode in front of the regiment , and addressing us again said , " My brave fellows , you have done all I asked you to do and more than could be reasonably expected . But your country is at stake , your wives , your houses , and all that you hold dear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we know not how to spare you . If you will consent to stay only one month longer , you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances . The present is emphatically the crisis which is to decide our destiny . ' " The drums beat the second time . The soldiers felt the force of the appeal . One said to another , " I will remain if you will . " " Others remarked , " We can not go home under such circumstances . ' " A few stepped forth , and their example was immediately followed by nearly all who were fit for duty in the regiment , amounting to about two hundred volunteers . " TOGETHER WITH A 1,600-man Pennsylvanian brigade commanded by Brig . Gen. Thomas Mifflin , and 600 Pennsylvania militia under Colonel John Cadwalader , Washington had managed to muster about 5,200 men , though many of them were poorly trained . Cadwalader , in fact , had arrived too late to take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pulled out . Not wishing to discourage the newly arrived reinforcements , Washington crossed the Delaware for the fourth time to join Cadwalader , then retired to the south bank of Assunpink Creek . // Slipping away from his camp on the night of January 2 , 1777 , Washington moved around Cornwallis ' army to strike the British between Princeton and Maidenhead . // To the north , the overall British commander , Lt. Gen. William Howe , remained cautious , for which his subordinates criticized him . Some might even have questioned his loyalty to King George III , as Howe understood and even sympathized with the rebel cause in the American colonies . He had opposed the Coercive Acts and at one time even declared that he would refuse an American command if it were offered to him . When the call came , however , Howe accepted , citing his duty to " serve my country in distress , " and saying , " A man 's private feelings ought to give way to the service of the public at all times . " After expelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested his men instead of pressing home the final , fatal blow . He had always considered his army more of an occupation force , and was certain that time and starvation would be his ultimate allies against Washington . And so , after fortifying Trenton , Bordentown , Burlington and various other posts around New Jersey , Howe had left his New Brunswick headquarters for New York , to wait out the winter . Then , however , Washington achieved his stunning victory at Trenton , killing or capturing 970 Hessian troops . It was an embarrassment that Howe could not allow to happen again . Howe had granted Lt. Gen. Charles Cornwallis leave to tend to his ailing wife in England . Cornwallis was moments from boarding his ship when news of the Trenton disaster arrived , along with orders from Howe to deal with Washington 's army once and for all . Journeying 50 miles through harsh weather , Cornwallis quickly organized British forces in southern New Jersey and plotted to strike back at the man who had kept him from returning home . Having left 1,400 troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maidenhead ( now Lawrenceville ) under Brigadier Alexander Leslie , Cornwallis had a total of 5,500 to 6,000 Redcoats with him . // A recruiting poster calling for young men to join the Continental Army in 1776 . By December of that year , Washington was pleading with his beaten , unpaid , demoralized soldiers to stay with him . // On January 1 , 1777 , Cornwallis led his main force toward Trenton , but his progress was delayed by a series of attacks , ambushes and fighting retreats orchestrated by rebel Colonel Edward Hand . The British did not reach Assunpink Creek until 5 p.m. on the 2nd , and Washington 's troops repulsed three attacks before Cornwallis camped for the night . " We 've got the old fox safe now , " the still-confident Cornwallis is said to have remarked . " We 'll go over and bag him in the morning . " WHILE CORNWALLIS watched across the way , fires sparkled by the rebel tents through the night ; men could be heard moving back and forth , perhaps preparing their sparse artillery for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on January 3 , Cornwallis rose and gazed across at the enemy lines . Except there was no enemy there . The rebels were gone . While Cornwallis slept , Washington had put his own plan into action . Leaving only 400 of his men to maintain a semblance of nocturnal activity in his camp , he had withdrawn his baggage and heavy artillery , with their wheels wrapped in rags to muffle the sound , south to Burlington . At 1 a.m. , the bulk of his army had departed on an audacious march around Cornwallis ' force to strike at the detachment the Briton had left behind at Princeton . To cut Princeton off from reinforcements , Washington detached 350 troops under Brig . Gen. Hugh Mercer to destroy the Stony Brook Bridge . Hugh Mercer had been labeled a rebel long before the American Colonies ' insurrection . As a young man , he had taken part in a failed coup aimed at placing Prince Charles Edward Stuart on the throne that his grandfather , James II , had lost in 1688 . The last of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle of Culloden in 1746 , and Mercer became a fugitive . Moving to America , he fought for Britain during the French and Indian War , during which he met and came to admire Washington . After that war , Mercer moved to Fredericksburg , Va. , where he bought Washingtons boyhood home , Ferry Farm-though he would never actually live there-and even acted as a physician for Washington 's mother . When the Colonists rose against the mother country in 1775 , Mercer joined the Patriots ' cause and was immediately made a colonel . He had distinguished himself again at Trenton , and it is likely that Washington had Mercer in mind when he wrote to John Hancock that the behavior of his officers " reflected the highest honor . " NOW IT WAS General Mercer 's job to cut off Cornwallis ' route to Princeton and on to New Brunswick across the Stony Brook Bridge . Unknown to him , however , another British force was also on its way to the bridge . After leaving the 40th Regiment of Foot to garrison Princeton , Colonel Mawhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55th regiments to join Cornwallis at Trenton . There were 276 troops of the 17th Foot with him when he reached Stony Brook Bridge at about 8 a.m. ; the rest trailed a mile behind . Mawhood had expected an unimpeded march to Trenton , but he looked back and noticed what seemed to be a patrol of between 350 and 400 men who were not his own . A moment of fear and panic set in-how did they get behind him ? Quickly he turned his troops around and ordered them back across the bridge . The high ground , not Trenton , was now his primary objective . Mercer , too , realized the hill 's importance and led his men there . The race turned into a confused melee as the two forces confronted one another at Clark 's Orchard . In the first exchange of gunfire , 26-year-old Captain William Leslie , nephew of General Leslie , was struck in the left breast and side while leading a company of the 17th Foot . He died moments later in the arms of his servant , Peter MacDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After several more volleys , the 17th Foot fixed bayonets . Only about 20 of Mercer 's militiamen earned muskets that mounted bayonets , and most had rifles that were slower to load than smoothbore muskets . In consequence , they fell back before the intimidating British rush . " No , " Mercer ordered . " Forward ! Forward ! " A bayonet pierced his chest , then another and another . A dozen blows or more , and the general slumped down near the hill that would later bear his name . At that point , some of Colonel Cadwalader s troops came up over Orchard Hill , but the more experienced British pushed them back too , leaving bayonet-pierced bodies in their wake . A rout of the Americans seemed to be in the offing , but then their commander suddenly appeared on the scene . While Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene rallied and reorganized his troops , Washington advanced to within 30 yards of the British line . A round was fired , and suddenly the Redcoats loosed a full volley of musket balls . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the tall , lean figure of General Washington . " Charge ! " he ordered , " Charge them ! Pull up ! Pull up ! " The Patriots regrouped , and soon it was the Redcoats who fell back . Remembering the enemy bugler 's call on Harlem Heights , Washington pressed forward , crying out , " It 's a fine fox hunt , boys ! " Just to the north , Maj. Gen. John B. Sullivan was busy engaging the British 40th and 55th regiments of Foot . After successfully outflanking their defenses with two regiments of his own at Frog Hollow , he managed to push the Redcoats back toward Princeton , where they took cover in and around Nassau Hall , part of the College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) . Captain Alexander Hamilton led the firing upon the hall , which was bombarded with artillery . One cannonball tore the head off a picture of King George II . At that point , the British surrendered , and 194 Redcoats became American prisoners . MAWHOOD REALIZED that his only chance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England to this day , the colonel led the 17th Foot in a bold charge in defiance of the numbers against him and managed to escape . Washington followed him closely for a time , capturing several more prisoners , but he knew it was only a matter of time before Cornwallis would show up with fresh Regulars . Wisely , he had his men destroy Stony Brook Bridge-and none too soon , for Cornwallis arrived just as the Continental rear guard was marching out . " My original plan when I set out from Trenton was to have pushed on to Brunswick , " Washington later explained to Hancock , " but the harassed state of our own troops ( many of them having had no rest for two nights and a day ) and the danger of losing the advantage we had gained by aiming at too much , induced me , by the advice of my officers , to relinquish the attempt . But in my judgment , six or eight hundred fresh troops upon a forced march would have destroyed all their stores and magazines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest containing 70,000 pounds , and put an end to the war . " The truth of that supposition will never be known for certain . On January 4 , Washington marched his weary soldiers north to Kingston , then up the east side of the Millstone River to Somerset Court House ( now Millstone ) . At Pluckemin , someone discovered the body of Captain Leslie in a captured baggage wagon , along with a letter to him from Continental Army surgeon Dr. Benjamin Rush , who had been a friend of the Leslies while studying medicine at Edinburgh , Scotland . Willie Leslie was buried with full military honors at Pluckemin churchyard , and after the war Dr. Rush paid for a suitable headstone . // After outflanking the British defenses at Frog Hollow , Major General John B. Sullivan drove the 40th and 55th regiments of Foot back toward Princeton , taking 194 prisoners at the College of New Jersey ( Library of Congress ) . // On January 5 , the Continental Army completed a 70-mile trek as its first units reached Morristown , where Washington established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Watchung Mountains protecting his eastern flank , Washington effectively controlled most of New Jersey for the time being . Cornwallis pursued him only as far as Kingston , then retired to New Brunswick , his only secure base in New Jersey other than Amboy . In his assessment of the Battle of Princeton , Washington reported that the enemy " in killed , wounded and prisoners must have lost near 500 men . Upwards of 100 of them were left dead in the field , and with what I have with me , and what was taken in the pursuit and carried across the Delaware , there are near 300 prisoners , 14 of which are officers , all British . " He was unable to ascertain his own casualties because of the continued pursuit , but estimated that the " slain in the field was about 30 . " In a letter to the secretary for the Colonies , Lord George Germain , that was partially reprinted in the London Gazette on March 12 , Howe recorded his losses at : " 1 Captain , 1 sergeant , 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenants , 2 Ensigns , 5 sergeants , 48 rank and file , wounded ; 1 Captain , 1 Lieutenant , 2 Ensigns , 5 sergeants , 4 drummers , 187 rank and file , missing . " His total was 276 . As for Washington 's men , Howe stated , " It has not come to my knowledge how much the enemy has suffered , but it is certain there were many killed and wounded , and among the former a General Mercer , from Virginia . " He also noted that " The bravery and conduct of lieutenant Colonel Mawhood , and the behavior of the regiments under his command , particularly the 17th , are highly commended by Lord Cornwallis . " Even Washington observed that the British regiments had made " a gallant resistance . " // Advancing to within 30 yards of the British line , Washington survived a musket volley . Crying , " It 's a fine fox hunt , boys , " he urged his troops on to a modest but morale-raising victory . // Some estimates have Continental Army losses as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 . By any estimate , the Americans achieved a convincing success in spite of their failure to capture-or even confirm the existence of-the 70,000 pounds . News of their victory at Princeton , coupled with that at Trenton , spread worldwide . In London it brought out ever more criticism within Parliament and among a public already having grave doubts about the war . By February 1778 , following the Franco-American treaties , Prime Minister Frederick , Lord North , was making an attempt at peace , but his plan was vague and did not include American independence . After Princeton the cause of American independence , once regarded as nothing but an ideal , became a distant but obtainable goal . The French , always ready to do whatever damage they could to the British , felt confident enough in the rebellion 's prospects to send supplies to America . After news arrived of an even greater American victory at Saratoga in October 1777 , the French would go further , officially recognizing the United States and committing to an alliance . But that was yet to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a harsh winter . Had Trenton and Princeton not given his men a morale-sustaining taste of victory , the Continental Army very well might have disintegrated . Now Washington began seeing new enlistments . The army , and therefore the cause , was still alive . As for Howe , his star was fading , but he managed to hold on to his command and even succeeded in capturing Philadelphia , also defeating Washington at the battles of Brandywine Creek in September and Germantown in October . After the capitulation of Lt. Gen. John Burgoyne 's army at Saratoga , however , Howe offered his resignation , fearing that he would be blamed for yet another military disaster . The offer was accepted , and after being replaced by Lt. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton on May 8 , 1778 , Howe sailed home to England on May 25 . Cornwallis , on the other hand , was somehow able to steer clear of most of the criticism . His next action would occur in April of that year , when he defeated Brig . Gen. Benjamin Lincoln 's men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters blew out of proportion in their reports . Cornwallis would later distinguish himself at Brandywine and march into Philadelphia alongside Howe . After returning from a trip to England to bury his wife , Cornwallis assisted General Clinton in securing the surrender of Charleston in 1780 , handing the Americans their worst defeat of the war . He was then entrusted with the entire southern command . In a letter to Lord Germain , dated January 8 , 1777 , Cornwallis had dismissed Washington 's Princeton gambit as a desperate effort and assured him that if Washington were to attempt another campaign , " the march alone would destroy his army . " His perspective seems to have changed , however , after surrendering his army to Washington at Yorktown on October 19,1781 . At that time , Cornwallis reminded Washington of the nine-days ' wonder that had pulled the Continental Army from the brink of extinction at the start of 1777 , and declared that " When the illustrious part that your Excellency had borne in this long and arduous contest becomes a matter of history , fame will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware than from those of the Chesapeake .
