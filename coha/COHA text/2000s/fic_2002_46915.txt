In the past , Robert Loy has offered up entertaining " hardboiled " looks at advertising ( " A Billboard Lovely as a Tree , " Dec. 2000 issue ) and fairy tales ( " Sing a Song of Sixpence , a Bottle Full of Rye , " June 1999 ) . Now he takes a skewed look at the dietary habits of the undead . Mr. Loy says his day job as a Port Police Officer in South Carolina and the work of home-schooling his three children keep him very busy . He does note that he passed the Jeopardy test , but still awaits " the call . " This story goes under the category UNDEAD DELIGHTS and the answer is : Would you like a swizzle stick in that ? <p> ALL THE OLD COUNT WANTED to do was die . Die and stay dead forever . " I 'm tired already . Is death such an unreasonable request from a 600-year-old man ? " he asked , looking up at the mute full Moon . But he already knew the answer . Vampires can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count knew this because he 'd tried hard to end his wretched unlife . He 'd ventured out into the noonday sun several times . This was purported to be the only sure way for a bloodsucker to shuffle off his immortal coil . But the old count had found it to be slow and pointlessly agonizing , sort of like setting yourself on fire but without the payoff of actually burning up . Other methods of self-destruction proved equally effective . Garlic juice in his Bloody Mary had netted him nothing more deadly than dyspepsia . More than once he 'd allowed that ridiculous teenager , the one who fancied herself a vampire-hunter , to get close enough to drive a stake deep into his chest . And that had worked . He 'd actually been deader than a doornail and death had been just as delightful as he 'd dreamed it would be . But then some freak electrical storm or mudslide would always come along and throw him out of his comfortable coffin . Or a group of occult  --  besotted youngsters with a bottle of cheap wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumbers . Or Lucifer would get a wild hair up his ass . Something . Always something . And the old count would be back in the damned land of the living , hunting for pitiful prey . Which is what he was doing now . Standing in an alley , freezing his hemorrhoids off , waiting for some wino or some poor misguided tourist to take a wrong turn . This is humiliating , the old count thought , blowing on his numb hands . How he longed to swoop down on a tender young maiden as he had so often back in the good old days . But his swooping days were long over . He did n't have enough brain cells left to remember how to turn into a bat , and the busted hip that never healed properly - and ached so awfully on cold nights like this - prevented him from pulling off even a half-assed pounce . No , vampires can not die , the old count thought , stamping his feet in a vain effort to warm up . But by god , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle and his cholesterol-laden diet he 'd gained a hundred pounds since his prime . He was deaf as a post and blind as a bat . ( The irony was not lost on the old count . ) He 'd long since traded in his dashing dark cape for size thirty-eight Depends . But he could live with the bifocals and the Miracle Ear and the diapers . It was the dentures he could not abide-the false fangs that always slipped out at the most inopportune moments or worse , got stuck in the neck of some pitiful couch potato too flabby and lungless to outrun a sexacentenarian . Having to excavate your canines from the throat of some lame or lardy schmuck . Now that really made the old count wish he were dead . Footsteps at the entrance of the alleyway jerked the vampire out of his morbid musings . He adjusted his glasses as he stepped cautiously from the shadows . It was a male , curse the luck . Although it had been centuries since anyone had considered him a ladies , man , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that the young dandy mincing his way down alley appeared to be brimming over with manly hormones . Hell , he looked like he might even be anemic , which meant the count would be hungry again in an hour , and now there was n't enough time to stop on the way home and grab a diabetic for dessert . " Pardon me , sir , " the old count said , stepping out into the path of the young man . " Can you spare a dollar for a man down on his luck ? " Pretending to panhandle made the process even more degrading , but any other opening gambit ran the risk of the potential prey bolting . " Sure , buddy . Hang on a sec . " The old count licked his lips as the young man reached into his shoulder bag . As hungry as he was , he knew he would not be able to drain this slim , frail boy dry . He wanted to . He had just enough fellow-feeling left to prefer to give his victims the gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew if he consumed all ten pints he 'd be jumping in and out of his coffin all day having to pee - or more likely holding the chamber pot and wishing to hell he could pee . Silently damning his prostate-and praying the Poli-Grip held - the old count sank his fangs into the young man 's neck . Ahimsa Green hesitated for a moment before stepping into the dark alley . It was a shortcut , but that was the only thing good you could say about it . It smelled like a Port-a-Potty and it was darker than a vivisectionist 's heart . Oh well , he thought , steeling his courage and stepping in , faint heart never won fairly pissed-off lady . Kim had been cold ever since she 'd caught him indulging in a little harmless flirting with Ingrid at the anti-fur rally . And that was a very dry kiss she 'd given him when he left the apartment that evening . But Ahimsa knew the weather was going to change in a big way when he got home more than an hour late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the meeting tonight , he told himself as he maneuvered around a shiny pile of broken glass shards . The circus - that barbaric holdover from the middle ages when slavery was a way of life - was coming to town . But they probably were n't going to like the welcome PAWS had planned for them . Almost everyone had signed up to do some time on the picket line . There were plenty of people willing to brave the cold and hand out Dumbo-in-chains pamphlets at ticket outlets all over town . It took just a bit longer to get volunteers for the guerrilla theatre production  --  understandable since it required one to spend some time naked in a cage hoping that Ivan , who fancied himself the Olivier of the A-R movement , did n't get carried away with that whip of his . They 'd even had a guest speaker , an entomologist from FSU . He had done a series of experiments proving that given a choice mosquitoes would prefer not to bite vegetarians , though he was at a loss to explain why this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was because mosquitoes are attracted to the smell of rotted flesh and putrid blood , which vegheads naturally lack . But he sounded to himself like he was moving into that **27;397;TOOLONG mode Kim ragged him about , and he knew he needed to lose that attitude before he got home . Well , the pesto-marinated tempeh kebabs had been delicious . Not to mention the soy shakes and the  --  Oh , goodness ! A homeless person stepped out into Ahimsa 's path . It startled him so badly he did n't hear what the poor soul said . But he knew the basics . He 'd heard it before . " Sure , buddy . Hang on a second . I know I 've got a fiver in here somewhere . " Ahimsa reached around for his shoulder bag to give the man a few dollars . He used to carry fresh fruit to give to needy street people until a couple of them demonstrated their disappointment by flinging the pears and apples at him . A lot of his fellow animal rights activists did n't really give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He always tried to help everybody who asked him . The name he had chosen for himself demanded no less . But when the elderly transient grabbed his arm with surprising strength , shoved him hard up against the cold brick wall and sank something sharp into his neck , Ahimsa could n't help feeling that this was taking charity way too far . The old count was up wide awake shortly after noon . But it was n't because his bladder was full or his belly was empty . He was excited , too excited to go back to sleep . And with good reason . For the first time since the early days of Queen Victoria 's reign he had awoken with an erection . A majestic one . A real pajama ripper . Even though it was the middle of the day , he just had to throw back the coffin lid to admire it . After it subsided he could not abide the thought of wasting his entire day , lying around in a musty old casket . His basement apartment had no windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much real danger of being struck by a sunbeam . So he puttered around the apartment . He made tea , he rearranged his books . He fed Rathbone , the blind dingo he tried to pass off as a wolfhound . He searched in vain for some sign of life in his only potted plant , a Venus fly trap . He considered fixing himself a cocktail but decided to wait . As soon as dusk descended , Lorinda dropped by . Lorinda was the closest thing the old count had to a girlfriend . She was a young thing , just a decade or two over two hundred . But the one time they had fooled around , the old count had put his hand down her shirt - then further down , all the way to her waist without getting anywhere near a nipple . Time takes its toll even on the young vampiric body . " Do n't tell me you 've forgotten what tonight is ? " Lorinda said in response to the old count 's puzzled reception . " It 's Saturday night . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook up with Mordred and Horace and raise a little hell . " The old count sighed . Back in the good old days he used to spend his Saturday nights in ballrooms , in palaces , amongst royalty and beautiful virgins and world-class bons vivants like Voltaire and Oscar Wilde . Now all he had to look forward to was " raising hell " with a gray-haired hag in stretch polyester pants and her pair of cronies , one of them surly and the other senile . It was unlikely but possible that somebody would be raising some hell tonight in this small Florida town . ( The old count and his followers had long since left the great cities of Europe and America to escape the cold weather and the crime . ) But if Old Nick 's realm was waiting for this pathetic quartet to handle the job , forget it . A bunch of old coots out looking for easy-access arteries did not strike the old count as being particularly hellish . Really it just seemed four times as pitiful as hanging out all alone in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevy Malibu out into the country . None of them felt like cruising the city after last weekend when they 'd been pulled over and ticketed for driving too slow and for " improper use of a turn indicator . " ( They might have gotten off with a warning , but Mordred had to argue with the deputy that the turn signal was correct because eventually they were going to turn left . ) They found an old isolated farmhouse and peeked hopefully into the window , but the homeowner was disgustingly robust and there seemed to be no aged grandparents , small children , or crippled spouses on the premises . They had about resigned themselves to heading back home , looking for fresh roadkill all the way , when they heard a low moan . In the field behind them was a cow , her udder dried up and useless . " Still a lotta blood left in that bag of bones , I 'll wager , " Mordred whispered . Horace emerged from his Alzheimer 's haze long enough to mumble something about bovine hemoglobin giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better idea , oh mister mighty hunter ? " Mordred challenged . Horace shook his head . " No . No , I did n't say it was a bad idea . I have n't had diarrhea in over a fortnight . " Mordred crept to the car and returned with four crowbars . They had tried to kill a cow before and never succeeded , but they had gotten close enough to keep trying . It would have been different if any of them could still do the old turn-yourself-into-mist trick or the bat thing with any degree of certainty . Bashing livestock with tire irons lacked panache . " Remember this time , " Mordred said to Horace as he handed him his weapon , " cows have four legs ; I on the other hand have two . " The bloodthirsty cattle-hunters huddled up behind a row of salt licks and waited . But when their intended victim , an unsuspecting Guernsey , moseyed by , the old count jumped up and yelled at her . " Flee ! Get away from here , you stupid fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her go with an empty feeling in his stomach . " What in hell did you do that for ? " Mordred yelled . " Are you out of your damn mind ? " The old count could n't explain why he had run the animal off . Something in her soft brown eyes . Something in the memory of his morning tumescence . Something he knew his friends would never understand . How could they ? He did n't understand it himself . He just shrugged his shoulders . The others made him walk home . " All of this stuff - all of your self-righteous , I'm-so-pure-let-me-tell  --  **33;426;TOOLONG crap - better be out of my home and out of my yard by the time I get back , " Kim said as she slammed the door , kicked over a box of Murder King stickers , and stalked off toward the driveway . " And you with it , Broccoli Boy . " " But , honey , baby , " Ahimsa started , willing himself with great effort not to give chase to the fluttering fast food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to get a triple bacon cheeseburger , French fries cooked in lard , and a big glass of ... of Clamato juice to wash it down . And I 'm going to demand that all of it be tested on animals first , poured in their defenseless little eyes while I watch ! Then I 'm going to start scrubbing your useless vegan ass out of my system and I do n't care how much cholesterol I have to ingest or how many little bunnies have to die for me to do it . " And pausing only long enough to pull a black Magic Marker out of her purse and scribble over the A HAMBURGER STOPS A BEATING HEART bumper sticker on Ahimsa 's Hyundai , and scrawl " Got Meat ? " on the driver 's side door , she was gone . Ahimsa could n't really blame her . It 's hard for a jealous woman to accept when her fiance comes home at SiX a.m. from a People and Animals Working to end Suffering meeting that started at nine P.M. Especially when his response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you been for the last nine hours ? " was " I 'm sorry ; I really do n't know . " But even then he probably could have sweet-talked and plea  --  bargained his way into a sentence of only a week or two in the doghouse if that had been the worst of it . You add a vicious-looking purple hickey on his neck that he was unable to account for the presence of , and Ahimsa knew he was lucky just to be alive . Still he hated to lose her , and if he was n't so worn out all of a sudden he 'd go after her and beg for another chance . Food . That was what he needed . Instinctively , Ahimsa headed for The Crepes of Wrath , intent on a black bean blintz , his ultimate comfort food . But when he was seated at his favorite booth , sipping his mangoginseng smoothie and perusing the menu he 'd already memorized , he realized he was n't hungry . Yes he was . He must be . That growling noise was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry for anything they served here . THIRTY-ONE POUNDS . The old count had lost thirty-one pounds . He 'd had to dig all of his too-skinny-clothes out of the bottom of the armoire . Now when he lay in his coffin he actually had room to turn over . He was n't forced to lie on his aching coffinsore  --  covered backside all night long . He had lots more energy too . It had to be because he had changed his diet from red to green . Now he ate spinach and collards and kale , green peas - oh , he loved green peas - frozen not canned , the canned ones tasted gray like the can - and salads with dandelion and mesclun greens . At first it did n't satisfy the hunger in his belly but it tasted so good in the mouth - that crisp green chlorophylly zing that tasted like the first day of Spring felt , back in the days - those increasingly nostalgic days  --  when the old count could still get out and experience a Spring day . Sometimes he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , not if he had to hurt anybody to get it . He actually found himself wishing he could go to church and have a taste of that blood that the Son of Man offered up so freely . He also found himself - because he mentioned this heretical idea in front of Mordred - ousted as leader of his conclave . From clan leader to caitiff . Even Rathbone had ran away from home . Not that he cared . His vampire friends were beginning to creep him out . The thought of sucking blood from a living person made him slightly sick to his stomach . He was sleeping more at night now , but in the evenings he enjoyed going out among the humans . He went to the movies - Babe and My Dog Skip made him cry . Once he went out to the public library . He was looking for a good vegetable cookbook , but also over in the new non-fiction section he 'd stumbled across Doctor Neil Lowenstein 's A New Understanding of Nosferatu . Dr. Lowenstein 's book advanced the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently lacked the essential life force , what the Hindus call prana and the Japanese call chi . Another book - Yoga for Absolute Knuckleheads - said that yogis could obtain this prana stuff directly from the air . The old count was a skeptic , had been a skeptic since back in the days when his old buddy Thomas Hobbes had been an optimist . But on reading this , something stirred in his long-dead heart . The old count was so excited he hurried home . He sat on the floor , briefly attempted to cross his legs until the arthritis and the phlebitis talked him out of it , and set out to find his chakras . After all these years he was n't sure if he still had chakras ( most of his nonessential organs  --  gall bladder , spleen , appendix , tonsils , and testicles - had long since turned to dust ) but he was willing to search for them . Closing his eyes and visualizing a spinning wheel of energy at the base of his spine , the old count took a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , he was homeless , sleeping on the couch of AL Williams and his boyfriend Hugo . ( The name on AL 's driver 's license was Animal Liberation Williams , but he no longer had to work to get the media 's attention , and these days he usually just went by the initials . ) And yes , Ahimsa was lying to these friends who had been kind enough to take him in . Lying to them every day . Not about Kim , he told them everything he knew about that situation ( they both smiled knowingly when he said he did n't know where the hickey came from ) , but about how much he enjoyed their portobello burgers and their butternut risotto and indeed about how committed he was to the cause of veganism and ending animal enslavement . That was only natural , was n't it ? A guy goes through a separation he starts to question everything , to examine his life . It 's part of the process of redefining oneself . And if Ahimsa was doing most of his redefining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first slice of pizza with what he still thought of as cow-udder-pus instead of soy cheese it was an experiment . It 's just dairy . Milk not blood . His reasoning was hey , nobody had to die for me to have this . But then he snuck into a Chik-fil-A , and it was n't just for waffle fries , although that was what he planned to tell anybody who recognized him . ( Forgetting altogether that waffle fries by themselves would have been hard enough to explain . ) Then it was back to Pizza Shack , but this time for a Meat Lover 's deluxe . And then it was on to steak houses for increasingly rarer slabs of cow . It was getting expensive . He would n't cook death in AL and Hugo 's pans , so he had to go out most every night . And he lived in constant dread of being discovered on one of these carnivorous quests . He thought about calling Kim . They could go out for a burger together now like " normal people . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contention . But he just could n't say out loud  --  except to faceless waiters - that he wanted to consume the flesh of innocent creatures . Then one morning while shaving he cut his chin . He was n't thinking about what he was doing . He was debating whether to have links or patties for breakfast . A teardrop of blood appeared . Still without thinking , Ahimsa reached out , scooped up the blood with his index finger , popped the finger in his mouth and sucked it down . His eyes closed with pleasure and he sighed contentedly . That one drop appeared to be all he was going to get . His blood was already beginning to clot . Without thinking about what he was doing , he picked up a nail file Kim had left behind and jabbed it deep into his forearm , then held his arm up to his face and greedily sucked down the resultant red fluid . Catching sight of himself in the mirror , Ahimsa was forced to admit that it was possible he might have a problem after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And not the vampire twelve - the other one . Noon . A warm sunny noon . It was n't only his genitals and his taste buds and other long-dormant body parts the old count was rediscovering . He 'd also gotten in touch with long-dead parts of his soul . Mostly his conscience . It kept riding him and reminding him of all the murders he had committed . All the blood he had shed . Innocent blood . Though it was driving him mad , he could not stop thinking about all the murders he had committed . ( Well , not all of the murders he had committed . Even with his brain cells whizzing along on ginkgo biloba , there was no way to remember ten thousand necks . ) The old count wondered briefly why the sight of the cross on the church did n't chum his stomach , then he went back to struggling with an unfamiliar emotion . Fear . He knew he had to go out into the sunlight and he knew it was going to kill him . And he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he also knew that this time he would succeed . When he 'd attempted solar suicide before it had been because he was tired , tired mostly of the long nights and hard work involved with being a fiend of hell . And fatigue quickly capitulates in the face of great pain . But now the old count 's motivation was self-loathing . He hated himself for what he was , for all the suffering and heartbreak and death he had caused . It would all end today . The church clock struck twelve . The old count stepped out of the alley and into the full sunshine . No hat , no sunglasses , no protection . He welcomed the fire . He did n't know how to pray and did n't really feel a need to communicate with any celestial beings , but he did mumble " I 'm sorry . " His last words . At least they should have been his last words . But for some reason the deadly solar rays were not burning him alive . They seemed to have no effect on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rays did have an effect . They felt ... they felt like that first hot geyser of blood at the back of his throat , only now it felt like that not just in his mouth but all over his body . The old count opened his eyes and slowly came out of his cringe . He peered down at his hands , his arms , his legs . All whole and unsinged . " What the - ? " He turned his face up toward the heavens . He was not on fire . He was ... he was warm , that 's what he was . And Jesus , it felt good to be warm . He threw off his shawl . It felt like the sun was melting the centuries off his body . The old count could actually feel himself growing younger , stronger , more alive . The old count felt a faint , familiar rhythm , and it took him a minute or two to trace it to its source - the middle of his chest . For the first time in almost five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh God , it 's a miracle ! " the old count shouted , frightening more than a few lunchtime pedestrians . " I 'm not undead ! I 'm not a vampire . I 'm human just like you - and you - and you ! " A police officer riding by on a motorcycle gave the count a menacing glare , but he did n't care . He felt so good , so alive and so happy to be alive he started dancing right there in the street . Dancing and laughing and crying and singing " You Are My Sunshine " all at once . In the shadows , clad in a tom " Respect animals , do n't eat them " T  --  shirt , the young vampire squinted against the sun . He was through denying what he was , through feeling pity for the weak . He was a member of the master race now and he was ready to start acting like one . He was going to kill somebody and drink their blood  --  every delicious drop . And he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor of becoming his first kill ? Someone who would n't put up much of a fight ; that damned sun was sapping all his strength . As if in answer to a demonic prayer a crazy old man came dancing down the street .
