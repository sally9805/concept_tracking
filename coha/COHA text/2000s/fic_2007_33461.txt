Chapter One I was in high school when I read The Bell Jar and thought it was about a lucky girl who wins a contest and gets to go to Europe . But what about Sylvia Plath 's trying to drown herself ? After she strings herself up and before she swallows pills ? To tell you the truth , I do n't think I looked at that part . To tell you the truth , I must have skipped a lot of parts in that book , maybe even the whole thing , because , let 's see , for starters , it takes place in New York . Nevertheless : Sylvia Plath finally did get to go to Europe . She studied at Cambridge University in England , and years after I read her book - or rather , some of her book - so did I. While I was there , a collection of Plath 's letters to her mother was published , which my mother read and wrote to me about . " Why ca n't you write letters to me like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving . " When I finally read the letters , long after I 'd left Cambridge , I discovered that my mother was right . Sylvia Plath 's letters were warm and loving . " Your mother is always right , " my grandmother once told me , " although I have never liked the yellow table in her center hall . " My grandmother also told me that she - my grandmother - believes everyone has a determined number of footsteps to use up in a lifetime , and , therefore , it is foolhardy to exercise since you will only exhaust your quotasooner and die . Let me give you the gist of a typical Plath letter : " My dearest of Mothers , I met the most marvelous man at the Trinity May Ball , where I wore an ice blue gown that was simply divine . Tomorrow , tea with the Queen ! I love you ! " I , too , had met a pretty marvelous man in England , though none of my letters home mentioned him . Let me give you the gist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . And if you like the weather , you 'll LOVE the food . Do you remember what I 'm supposed to be writing my thesis about ? I have to hand a chapter in , but I ca n't remember what my topic is . I think I wrote the title in a postcard I wrote to you a couple of months ago . The bursar 's office says they never received your check . " Sylvia Plath and I had one thing in common besides our outfits for socializing with the Queen - mine being a never-worn , never-to-be-worn drab long skirt ; and hers , well , to be honest , I ca n't actually say if she had an ice blue gown or ever met the Queen . As I told you , I was giving you the gist . In any case , Sylvia and I were alike in that both of us had a habit of shielding our mothers , and in my case , my father , too , from what was really going on in our respective lives . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven thing . Even her mother knows now . But I do n't think you know very much about me . An only child , I was born in the suburbs of Philadelphia , a town called Abington . My ancestors were - no , do n't worry . I wo n't tell you everything . I 'll start when he knocked on my door . The marvelous man was wearing a rugby shirt and jeans and sneakers and he looked boyish , I thought , for someone from another generation . " You do n't look twenty-eight , " I said . I was twenty-one . " You can count the rings , " he said . " You 're married ? " I said . He laughed . " I meant tree rings , " he said . " It was a joke about dendrochronology . " " Oh , " I said . " I never get dendrochronological jokes . " He told me that he 'd arrived from New York that morning , that he was going to be a teaching fellow in philosophy , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone famous I pretended to have heard of , that he 'd taken a year off to join VISTA and eradicate poverty in Scarsdale ( did I really hear him say Scarsdale ? ) , and that a friend of mine had suggested he look me up - he 'd dated one of her roommates , who 'd run off to an ashram in India after he broke up with her . She still wrote to him , though the motif , he said , was mainly gastrointestinal . Those were the days when a person with a knapsack might knock on your door , say he was a friend of a friend of a cousin of an ex-girlfriend of a guy he had hiked with in Australia , and you then invited this person to sleep on your sofa and eat your food for as long as he felt like it . It was well within your guest 's rights to take or break one of your cherished possessions , and unacceptable for you to care because that would be materialistic . Hitchhiking through Europe a year or so before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up living for a week with someone who 'd been a medical student for the last twelve years , during which time he 'd saved the rind of every tangerine he 'd eaten . Thousands of dried rinds , each a perfect half sphere , were stacked throughout the apartment . Toward the end of my stay , the rinds nearly burned to a crisp when I stood too close to the fireplace and my cheap pants burst into flame . But Eugene Obello was only wondering if I 'd like to go for a walk with him . Right now . Those were also the days before date books and plans and pretending you had something else to do in order to look popular . So I said yes . While Eugene was in the bathroom , I took one of my smart-looking social theory books from my bookshelf and positioned it in a conspicuous spot . How far I had come from Abington High . " Remember Abington , " the principal used to announce every morning over the PA . " First in the alphabet , first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been first in the alphabet , but the other two ... iffy . And look at me now : Cambridge University ! Abington was a large bland redbrick public high school built in the 1950s . This place was a dominion of majesty established in the thirteenth century by King Henry III . " I 'm living like royalty , " I wrote to my parents when I arrived . " Could you please send me my down quilt ? " Grungy-looking students hung out all day in the college bar , smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and drinking ale . Another clique modeled itself on the Bloomsbury group - someone dressed and talked like Virginia Woolf , another like Clive Bell , another like Duncan Grant , and so on . There were some actual descendants of the Bloomsbury group at the college , but the look-alikes would have nothing to do with them , regarding them as poseurs . Even the student council was something to write home about : they issued a statement coming out against political , economic , and legal discrimination , which they happened to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still mostly made up of upper-class males , the first females having been accepted only a few years earlier . Some of the upper-class males belonged to a society whose sole function , so far as I could make out , was to break into the room of a first-year student , interfere with it , and leave a check for damages done . Then they peed in the fountain - the one topped by a statue of Henry VI with the symbolic figures of Learning and Religion seated below . So : the splendid architecture , the adorable boys ' choir , the fields of daffodils ... you get it . " They even have grazing cows on the lawns . How inspirational ! " I wrote to my parents . " And I heard that only the students in MY college are allowed to shoot and eat the swans that swim on the Cam . " In a P.S. , I added , " I NEED money to go to Wales . Maybe you could sell my charm bracelet - the one you gave me for my Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could you send me some hangers ? " That entire first year , gosh , I was happy . I was a foreigner ! I 'd never been to Europe and now here I was , in a country where everyone sounded like Winston Churchill or Mary Poppins ; where all the women had flawless skin and all the men looked as if they 'd been wandering around in the Underground since World War II , never having seen the light of day or another change of clothes . Every aspect of life in England seemed a notch from normal . Which made even the mundane exotic and exhilarating . I swear if I had been mugged on a greensward , this , too , would have been utterly delightful because he would n't have been just any mugger ; he would have been a mugger with an accent . You know what else is nice about being a foreigner ? Whatever you do takes place in a capsule that need not be discovered and opened by someone back home . Nothing really counts - it was the life that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . I felt free to ... oh , I do n't know . Eugene returned to my bedroom . He 'd been in the bathroom . " If it 's not too rude to ask , " he said , " bearing in mind I met you only a few minutes ago , and I hope I 'm not entering some kind of kinky area here , or maybe I do " - Eugene smiled , I did n't - " but what are all those buckets and funnels doing in your bathtub ? " I dropped my lip gloss into a drawer so he would n't catch me trying to look good while he 'd been out of the room . Makeup seemed like cheating to me , then ; but boy , oh boy , it does n't now . " I make ginger beer , " I said . Eugene took off his jacket and put it on my bed . " I lay a wager you did n't know that you can simulate ginger ale by combining Sprite with a splash of Coca-Cola , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around , considered what to do with it , put it back on the bed . " Really ? " I said . Eugene stared at me while I thought hard what to say . " Sprite seems tough to make , " was what I came up with . " I 'm not particularly fond of ginger beer , " he said . " Oh , I hate it , " I said , wanting him to think we had an opinion in common . Incidentally , it was true . " But it 's easy to make . " Why was a PhD-track graduate student who hated ginger beer involved with moonshine ? Because my next-door neighbor , Obax Geeddi Abtidoon , a rich and beautiful Somalian who wanted to be a chef but was getting her degree in polar studies when she was n't cooking curry and making sliced carrot salad for everyone on the floor , had given me the ginger beer starter and how could I be so rude as to throw it out ? Eugene sat on the only chair . His way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus , this left the bed as the only place to sit , which seemed too friendly , but I perched myself on the edge anyway and tried to look nonchalant . I know I said that the buildings at Cambridge were magnificent , but my dorm , built in the sixties out of concrete , was the exception . When I was happy , I found the room sterile and claustrophobia-inducing and depressing ; when I was unhappy , I found the room sterile and claustrophobia-inducing and consoling . It was decorated , if that is the word , in basic dormitory furniture but with a touch of a color that could only be called veal - veal curtains , veal bedspread , and a veal and gray shag rug . Instead of wallpaper , the walls were covered with grainy veal linoleum - linoleum was definitely a theme in this building . A mechanical alarm clock sitting on a bookshelf was wrapped in a towel because someone had told me that fluorescence caused multiple myeloma . On the floor cartons of books lay , which I had insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live without being surrounded by literature . I shipped them home every summer when I returned to Philadelphia and they came back with me every fall . I do n't think I ever opened one , but this was a phase of my life when I wrote things in letters to my parents such as " I 'm reading a lot of epistemology because I never had the chance in college , " and , " Saw The Birthday Party last night in London . I could write like Pinter but when would I get around to it with this damn thesis around my neck ? " My room overlooked a courtyard in which there was a small man-made pond stocked with goldfish . After a potted gardenia I had placed on my windowsill fell into the pond , it seemed by volition , I went around saying that flowers committed suicide when they were near me . From my window , I could see my friend Libby 's room , on the same floor . She and I constantly wrote notes , slipping them underneath one another 's door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Celtic , so her notes were , as she said , " strewn with rune . " In a letter home , I compared Libby 's wit with that of P. G. Wodehouse , though I had never read a single book of his . " Let N represent the set of natural numbers , " Eugene said . " If it 's up to me , " I said , " N can be anything it wants . " " Very good , " Eugene said . " Now let 's put forth the proposition that there can not be a set of all sets . And yet it seems also true that any group of items can be collected into a set , right ? " I nodded . It could n't be possible - could it ? - that upper-echelon philosophers were doing the same math that Miss Kilroy taught us in third grade ? I 'd asked Eugene to explain what he was working on , a little bit because I wanted to know but mostly because I wanted to divert him long enough for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains so they obscured the sealed bottle of milk that had been sitting on my sill for about three months . I did n't know much about much , but something told me that putrefying milk was not the way to put one over on a suitor . I must have intuitively known even then , though , that if you ask a certain type of guy about himself , it 's as good as winding a wind-up toy . For a given amount of time , said guy is in motion and requires only minimal attention from you . In this way , men are easier than plants . " You really want to hear this ? " he said . " Yes ! " I said . The bottle , by the way , was an experiment , albeit one without a hypothesis . My research partner , Libby , and I were simply curious to see what would happen to very , very , very old milk . So far , blue and green had happened . Let 's now ignore Eugene while he describes what he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . Meanwhile , I 'll tell you what I was working on . Eugene had not asked , so it had n't come up in our conversation . Nothing . In April , the month I met Eugene , my thesis topic , an ever-changing thing , had something to do with comparing the Jewish struggle against Fascism in the 1930s in Britain with the West Indian struggle against racism and the National Front today . The problem with that , it turned out , was they had almost nothing in common . My original topic had been " The Effects of the Changing Role of Women in a Yorkshire Fishing Village Upon Family and Social Structure . " However , after I 'd spent several weeks in an actual Yorkshire fishing village , interviewing dozens of people , it became clear that because of their accent I had no idea what anyone was saying . Transcripts of the hundred or so hours of tapes reveal that I frequently asked my subjects questions they 'd just answered . And they were so polite . They answered again . Whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I spent my time ... come to think of it , I had turned into one of those people of whom I think , What do they do all day ? Let 's see . Leafing through brochures of Mediterranean islands to which I would never travel took time , as did my daily swim in the public pool across town . Then there were the excursions to the nearest department store to try on cashmere sweaters ; to the open-air market to buy a mere satsuma orange . I taught myself to ride a bicycle without using hands and tried to teach myself German from a book , mastering only the phrase for " You are a fried egg " before I quit . I went to the Black Kettle across the street , where my work-shy friends and I lingered over cups of coffee for the sole purpose of eavesdropping on the inane conversations of tourists . ( Man , pointing to the steps to the second floor of the restaurant ; to waiter : " Do these stairs go up ? " ) I made frequent visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can you believe it ? ! " I wrote my parents . " This country has no double yellow adhesive labels ! Please send some . " That 's what I did all day , and curiously , nobody in a position of authority much cared . Two months had passed since I 'd seen my adviser , Geoffrey Guppy , a genial man in his sixties , known for his work in the tribal politics of Guinea-Bissau and also in the sociology of what transpires during the first minute of conversation in different cultures . We 'd met to discuss a chapter I 'd written entitled " How Successful is T. S. Kuhn in Avoiding Problems of Relativism in His Discussion of Paradigms in Natural Sciences , " for a thesis whose topic I ca n't conjure up today or perhaps even then . But I do remember his critique : " I looked up the word ' redeive , ' " he had said , " and could n't find it in the dictionary . " " It was a typo , " I had said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carry on . Now . When you write ' in 1934 , ' do you mean ' in the year 1934 ' ? " (
