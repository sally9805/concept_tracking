<p> You ca n't blame the Society of Professional Journalists for giving its members what they want , but if it puts on many more functions like one it staged last week , it might not have many members left . <p> SPJ hosted a panel discussion called " Dot-Com Fever " at the Marines Memorial building last Thursday night , and 25 people turned out to hear a quartet of former journalists tell how they leaped onto the Internet . <p> Now , SPJ represents online scribes as well as those of us in the dead-tree media ( I 'm a member myself ) , but the latest trend does n't have reporters and editors leaping to online journalistic ventures like Cnet , Wired News and MarketWatch.com . Instead , they 're opting for bigger paydays at places like Healtheon/WebMD , Quicken.com , AllBusiness.com and BabyCenter , to name a few . <p> The jobs at these sites are what I 'd call " quasi-journalistic . " They require the skills of the old media  --  the ability to dig out facts , tell an interesting story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jobs are n't in the service of a public trust , as old-line newspapers , magazines and broadcasters like to think of themselves . Instead , they 're providing content that the sites ' owners hope will lure Web surfers ' eyeballs and make the sites ' employees ' stock options worth something . <p> Todd Lappin , a former Wired writer , is now " chef du content " at Guru.com , a site that connects independent workers with jobs . He jokingly refers to his move as going to " the dark side , " a gibe once reserved for reporters who took jobs in public relations . <p> Like many of those who made the leap , Lappin says money was n't the issue . " I was totally burned out on writing about startups , " he says . <p> " I had been doing it for five years and seeing the same story , over and over , inserting new company names . I thought , Instead of writing about it , I might as well do it . ' " <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options and high salaries are helping lure people to the risky world of dot-coms . " If the company you choose takes off , you could make a lot of money , " says Michael Krantz . <p> In February , Krantz left what he calls " an awesome job , a job I loved " as San Francisco bureau chief for Time magazine to become editorial director of Keen.com , a Web site in which people with questions can find ( and pay to talk to ) people with answers . <p> But Krantz says the long hours dictate that " you have to do it because you love what you do , " not just for the money . " I wanted to see the dot-com world from the inside , " he says . He does n't consider himself a journalist anymore . <p> Others say the jobs can be more humane than the positions they left in old media . <p> Marcia Parker , a former managing editor at the Contra Costa Times , is now assistant managing editor for content at Quicken.com , a Web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Even though I love newspapers as a medium , and it 's where I started , it 's hard for me to see growth , " Parker says . " I do n't see newsrooms as the vital place they need to be . It does n't feel the same to me now . " <p> Unlike newspapers , Parker says , Silicon Valley software companies like Intuit know " the value of people and how to retain them . There 's more emphasis on the balance of life , and this is a team effort to build something . " <p> Some in the journalism community have expressed concern about ethical breakdowns , particularly when reporters are covering a company  --  and then leave to work for that company . Jodi Mardesich raised eyebrows when she left Fortune for Drspock.com after writing a story about the nascent Web site for parents . <p> At last week 's SPJ forum , Susan Smith Hendrickson told how sticky it can get . She was interviewing AllBusiness.com for her paper , the San Francisco Business Times , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . <p> It got weird , Hendrickson said , when she started at the firm  --  and the only item in the press kit was her column with her photo on it . <p> At the SPJ forum , several **28;1930;TOOLONG offered advice to their brothers and sisters looking to make the same jump . Steve Chin , a former Examiner reporter turned entrepreneur who is building an Asian American news and information site at www.aonline.com , suggested asking around to find out what the going rate is for salaries and stock options . ( He frequently fields those calls from former colleagues . ) <p> The numbers change rapidly , Chin said . " What I was paying editorial people two years ago is probably $20,000 to $30,000 higher today , " he said . When companies ask what you 're earning now , he said , " You do n't have to tell them the truth . It would n't hurt to add another $10,000 or $15,000 as a starting point . " <p> Chin also advised building a Web site that has your resume and links to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine Griffin , a former journalist at Health magazine and now a senior editor of the consumer portal that Healtheon/WebMD is building , cautioned , " Make sure journalists are there who understand the structures that need to be in place for journalists to operate independently . " <p> In fact , the risk that the new bosses will trample on their journalistic sensibilities is only one hazard for those making the leap . The bigger risk is that the company will go under , and the stock options will end up worthless . <p> Yet  --  even though I 'm resisting it myself ( some of us just have ink in our veins )  --  I can see the upside . Even if an Internet firm implodes , the reporter who made the leap wo n't have any trouble finding a new job . In fact , it 'll be even easier , since other Net firms will see that person as the sort of risk taker who 's in demand . <p> And for a journalist working at a business that fails , there 's probably a book contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let that be a warning to any company looking to hire an old-world reporter . <p> BUYING OPPORTUNITY ? New-media firms took some of the worst beatings in last week 's stock market rout , and this week 's recovery has n't helped them much . The hardest hit was Salon.com ( never a Wall Street favorite ) , which hit its 52-week low of $2.38 on Monday , rebounding to close yesterday at $3 . Also bloodied were MarketWatch.com , which hit its 52-week low of $18.14 Monday before closing yesterday at $16.25 ; TheStreet.com , which hit its low of $5.50 on Friday , closed at $6.94 yesterday ; ZDNet bottomed out Monday at $11.63 , recovering by yesterday to $13 ; and Cnet , which hit its low of $22.50 on Monday , rebounded to $31.50 yesterday . <p> Perhaps these rock-bottom prices will make these companies attractive takeover targets . Already , TheStreet.com is on the block . ( Can you say turmoil ? In recent weeks , it changed its business model , lost its CFO and lost a big investor when Bear Stearns Asset Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good fit here might be something like Quicken.com , which is trying to beef up its content offerings . ) <p> But I do n't know if any of the other companies are ready to sell out . When the semiconductor industry neared the bottom of a cyclical slump in 1998 , there were n't many takeovers , because no one wanted to sell when their stock was low . At those prices , they might as well gamble and wait to get some real money . <p> OVER DALE : Now that San Francisco magazine  --  the monthly formerly known as San Francisco Focus  --  has completed its second redesign in two years , it 's looking for a new editor . Dale Eastman , who joined when Diablo Publications bought Focus from KQED , is leaving the 130,000 circulation publication June 1 . <p> Eastman 's departure is voluntary , although she does n't know where she 's headed next . Perhaps a dot-com ? " I 'm definitely thinking about that , " Eastman said . " I love things in transition . " <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description indicates that perhaps new media is n't the only place where the church-state wall is in jeopardy . In addition to wanting someone with strong editing skills , the ad says the ideal candidate " will enjoy interacting with the community and advertisers .
