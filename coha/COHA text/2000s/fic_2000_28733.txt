Egypt Though the ground was hard and sharp , Ingrid knelt in the dirt . The dry surface layer , lifted by the afternoon wind , dusted her damp skin . She brushed the hair from her eyes , streaking her cheek with brown , looked up at the farmer who stood above her and placed her hands flat on the earth . " This is no good for farming , " she said . " It 's very , very old . " The farmer 's face was stubbornly blank . He did not want to understand . She began digging , jagged bits of rock tearing at her fingertips . Soon she found something . Holding up a shard , she smiled . " You see , antiquities . Good for tourists . Good for money . " The farmer squatted and reached for the shard . After studying it , he threw it down and shook his head . " This was a palace , " Ingrid said , retrieving the shard . " A place where kings lived . Pharaohs . " The farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said resolutely . " Kings in Giza . " " Giza is where they died . They lived here . " " Giza tourists . No here , " the farmer said , waving a brown hand over the soil . " No here . " At a distance , a donkey stood in calm resignation , one hoof slightly raised . As the farmer approached , it opened a mournful eye . The donkey was hitched to a crude plow with rusted blades that cut into the earth as the animal again plodded forward in the heat . Ingrid walked back to the jeep . " He wo n't listen , " she said . " I think it 's because I 'm a woman . " " It 's because he 's a Fellahin , " Louis said . " They 've been doing this for three thousand years . " " Like you , the Fellahin are impressed only by Giza . " Ingrid chewed a fingernail and watched the farmer push an uneven row into the soil . " Damn . " She got out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned the plow to start the next row when Ingrid stood in front of him . " You understand maat ? It 's very bad maat to plant here . Your crop will fail . You have a family ? They will get sick . Malaria . Maybe they will die . " The farmer stared at her through the donkey 's ears . Then he clicked with his tongue , urging it on . " Wait , " Ingrid said . " Just wait . I can get money for you , money instead of farming . How much money for this whole field of crops ? How much for one year of crops ? " " Much money . " " How much ? " she insisted . " Enough for donkey . " He pointed at his harnessed animal . " Two donkey . " " Two donkeys . Just wait , then . Do you understand ? No more today . Tomorrow I will bring you money for two donkeys . " The farmer nodded , and Ingrid was content for the moment to leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I need to get back to Cairo , " she told him . " I 've promised him two donkeys ' worth of piastres . How much is a donkey worth , anyway ? " " Why are you doing this ? " Louis said , starting up the jeep . " You leave in two days . " " Wait . " Ingrid held him back . " I want to see if he starts again . " They sat with the motor idling until the farmer led the donkey to a stand of tall grass into which he folded himself as the donkey began to graze . " He 's gone to sleep . " " He 's dreaming about how with two more donkeys he 'll be able to plow the field three times as fast , " Louis said . " We 're going to have to dig after sunset . I need to find something tonight . " " You will get a bad reputation with the Fellahin . " " I already have a bad reputation with the Fellahin . But I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for future work . " Louis ' eyes traveled across the plot of land . " I know mudbrick is not my specialty , but to me it looks like an ordinary field . " " Be a friend and pretend it 's important . Pretend there 's an inverted pyramid under that farmer 's plow . " Louis smiled and put the jeep into gear . " Because you are leaving , I will indulge you . " They followed a maze of dirt tracks dividing the planted fields . The side of the road was lined with papyrus , the reed used for centuries as paper by the people of Egypt . A few ancient scraps had survived : love letters , poems , lists-relics of undocumented lives of incidental men and women indentured to their pharaoh . This pharaoh was known by other titles : one of them was " king , " another " god . " Ingrid thought , not for the first time , that it must have been a rotten life for them . Their crops and families were abandoned as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was always being built . Sometimes it was decades before they returned home , backs bent or broken by the weight of monumental stone . She imagined the seeds of insurrection taking root and quickly withering again because any such feeling reflected a dangerous lapse in faith -- a disbelief in the system of maat . And if you disturbed the balance of maat , you opened your life to danger . They reached the paved road to Cairo and slowly picked up speed , the jeep lurching with each gear shift . Ingrid tied her hair in a scarf against the wind , chasing and capturing the skybound strands with one hand , anchoring the scarf with the other . She was momentarily blinded , trying to control the hair that , unbound , drew too much attention in this country . " Why did you decide to study ruins that no one could see ? " Louis shouted , his own hair a chaos of dark curls . " Because there is no truth in temples , " Ingrid shouted back , pulling hair from her mouth . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it told . Glorified , altered , edited . It 's unlikely that any of it actually happened . I want to know how the people lived , not just how the elite chose to die . " Louis swore in French as a motorcycle zagged in front of them . " The rest of the population catered to that elite , I can tell you that . " " Even the kings and queens of this country had to live , eat and make love somewhere . It 's pretty damn clear it was n't in the pyramids or the temples . It 's unfortunate that they chose to build their palaces out of the best fertilizer around . " " They were temporary , " Louis said . " Life was temporary . " In the hotel lobby they paused , stunned by the sudden darkness . A few pieces of luggage leaned against the wall . An old paper lay on an age-stained table tinged with the neglect of rapid comings and goings . The places in between , Ingrid thought , are what you notice when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , allowing their eyes to adjust . Up ahead at the reception desk , a letter waved at them in the dim light . " For the lady , " the girl behind the desk said sullenly . Ingrid stepped more quickly , reaching the desk first . The girl blinked her charcoaled eyes at Louis . " Nothing , " she said . Louis guided Ingrid up the stairs while she studied the postmark . " So your Templeton is not dead after all , " he said . She tucked the envelope away and groped in her bag for her room key . " You 're not the least bit curious , are you ? " " About Templeton ? Absolutely . " " About the mudbrick . " " Oh , that . A bit , yes . " " It 's not very sexy , is it . I should have chosen something sexier . I 'd have more funding . In the Cairo museum , I saw an old makeup case of Hathepsut 's from before she became pharaoh , when she was queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife . ' It was n't found in her tomb because she died as a god , not as his wife . " " For some men , maybe this is not so sexy . " " That 's why men do n't write about Hatschepsut . They write about pyramids . " Louis laughed . Ingrid stopped outside her door . " I need a shower . " " And a wash of the hair . " Louis smiled sadly . " With the dust , the shine dies . " Light filtered through the thin curtains in Ingrid 's room . She tied them open with ribbon she had bought at the bazaar . The street below was hazy with dust ; the desert had again breathed on the city , covering its greenery with a patina of fine sand as if to say Do n't forget me . I can bury you as I buried others . She sat down at her writing table , a faded map taped to the surface . She had learned the trick about maps from Templeton . They were like stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Egypt , there were pharaohs who , after death , had been effectively erased from the map , their temples and cities destroyed , their names chipped out of the very obelisks that had honored them . Akhenaten was one such pharaoh , Hatshepshut another . Akhenaten had attracted more discussion and debate than almost any figure of ancient times , with his radical worship of one god and his visionary poetic writings . Much had been made of the resemblance of his God Aten to the Christian God : " Thou hast made heaven afar off that thou mayest behold all that thou hast made when thou wast alone , appearing in thy aspect of the Living Aten , rising and shining forth , " he had written . " Thou art in my heart , but there is none other who knows thee save thy son Akhenaten . Thou hast made him wise in thy plans and thy power . " Ingrid had steeped herself in these writings and the writings inspired by him , drawn initially by his conflicting reputations as the instigator of monotheism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where there is argument , " Templeton had said when she presented her thesis outline to him , " there is life . Akhenaten is a fine place to begin . " Hatshepsut had come later . Templeton alone had seen Ingrid 's commitment to Akhenaten falter . " Your mind found a home in Akhenaten , " he surmised . " But your heart found a better home with Hatshepsut . We must pay attention to what our heart prefers -- for ourselves as much as our work . " Ingrid turned his letter over , inspecting the envelope . She bent it slightly and smiled : it was covered with late-night scratchings she would never be able to read . She placed the envelope above the map and picked up the shard . It had once been painted . She pushed the soft parts of her fingertips into its sharp corners and then placed it over the area on the map where she had found it . " I will find you , " she whispered . After he had showered , Louis came over with a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's long , " she said . " I 'm saving it for later . Can you meet me and Mustafa at the field in a couple of hours ? " " If you 'll come with me to the pyramids after . " " Fine , if we find something . If we find something big , I 'll do whatever you want . " When Louis raised an eyebrow Ingrid turned sharply and jammed a comb into her tangled hair . They were friends , but the friendship sometimes crossed lines . " Here , let me do that , " Louis said , reaching out with his hand . He positioned her at the sun-filled desk and began to carefully unsnarl her hair . " You should n't tear at it that way , " he told her . " It breaks . " Ingrid sat quietly with her hands in her lap . In the silence of his concentration , she began nervously pushing her cuticles back with her fingernails , watching Louis in the mirror . He was dark , someone who belonged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly tanned by the Sahara sun ... She tugged at the uneven ends of her hair . " Someday I 'm going to cut it all off , " she said . " I 've dreamt about doing it with enormous red scissors . " " French women do this usually later in life , when they are ready to be free . " " And I am not yet ready ? " Louis just smiled . He pulled the loose hair from the comb and let the fine yellow web float into the wastebasket . Ingrid frowned in the mirror . " I wonder what Hatshepsut did to her hair when she became pharaoh . " " And what her lover did when she wore a beard . " Louis ran the comb smoothly through her hair . " Voila , you 're all ready for digging . Tell Mustafa I will be around later , so he had better behave . " Mustafa was an old dragoman , who had for decades guided tourists through the pyramids . He had made a good living for himself and , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aptitude for the digging process itself . His hands were said to be the nimblest in Cairo . He increased his prices as his reputation as a " finder " grew . He had endurance and , beyond that , instinctual knowledge . How else could he be so certain , so free of doubt ? " They are speaking to me , " he would say with perfect calm when locating a new relic . Mustafa was paid by the artifact . He lived close to the site and worked in the cool hours of the early morning and evening , when the Europeans , who did not understand the desert , slept and ate . In the evening sun , the windows of the perfumeries blazed with color , the deep light bursting inside the rows of tinted flasks and vials like jewels on an outstretched necklace . Incense and perfume had been manufactured by Egyptians for over three thousand years , but all that remained was a cluster of cheap , honey-tongued vendors that could make any woman smell like a queen . By the time Ingrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shibuk . The long pipe lay next to him like a lover . " Sit , have some tea . I thought you were leaving . " " In two days . I want to check one last site . " " You are still looking for the woman pharaoh ? " " Yes . " " A woman who wanted to be a man , even dressed as a man . To me , she is not interesting . " " Her reign was prosperous and stable . Long , too , I might add . " Mustafa surveyed his guest , easing her into his consciousness with the hypnotic stroking of his beard . " You like her because she was a woman ? But to find her , you will have to think like a man . Maybe wear a false beard as she did . And a pharaoh 's kilt . " Mustafa found this picture amusing and touched his shibuk as if nudging a friend who might see the humor . " If she had reigned as a woman , Mustafa , no one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly . " Does this not teach you enough ? A woman 's place is not on the throne . " Ingrid smiled . " I am coming to you not to discuss politics , but because I want your opinion on something . There is a site , a field . I think it may have been one of Hatshepsut 's mudbrick palaces . " " And you think this why , you have smelled her perfume ? " Ingrid ignored him and pulled out her map . " While she was supervising her expeditions to lower Africa , she would have had a palace built somewhere along the way to the Red Sea , which was where her boats set off . Cairo was close to the water . It would have been a good place to wait . " Mustafa stroked his beard in silence . " The problem is there is a farmer who is ready to plow the field . I need your help . Maybe your hands can find something for me there tonight . " " There is a price for the hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At sunset , Louis came in the jeep with a blanket and a basket of food . He waved to Ingrid where she stood in the field , uncorked a bottle of wine and drank from it , watching her as she bent down at some distance from Mustafa , her skirt blowing in the breeze . He whistled to her the way one would whistle to a horse and held up the bottle of wine when she turned . He had on a clean white shirt over his worn khakis . She came toward him , smiling . " Mustafa wo n't let me watch him , " she said . " And he wo n't let me dig . " Louis handed her a glass of wine and held his in the air . " He does n't like competition , " he said . " That 's where we differ . " As the light faded , they watched Mustafa in the field . The deepening shades of blue in the sky were ablaze with great streaks of orange and red . Louis set out baba ghanouj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence until the light in the sky was suddenly extinguished . " I 've been developing a theory about light , " Ingrid said . " Have you noticed there 's no twilight in Africa ? " " Yes , it 's true . It is not a gentle transition . " " It must affect the way the psyche develops . I think it makes people here stronger . No gentle twilight to ease them into the darkness . " Ingrid bit into a dolma . " Maybe it 's twilight that makes Westerners so sentimental . They can sit on their porches and watch day recede as night approaches . It gives them time to consider what they 're going to lose . It 's like dying slowly versus being shot . " In the field , Mustafa lit his lantern . His robes hung around him like a shroud , his profile jutting from the smooth fabric . They watched him in the narrow glow of the lantern 's flame . " In France , we have twilight , " Louis said . " Le lit de lavende @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's because you are a pompous people . " " Since we are being honest , " Louis said , " the word I use for Americans is ' mushy . ' It is not as dignified as sentiment . " " American mush is paying for your project , Louis . You should be grateful . " " According to your theory of light , " Louis toasted the sky with his wineglass . " I have twilight to thank . " Mustafa approached them , his lantern swinging . " Nothing , " he announced . Ingrid sat up . " Nothing ? " " It is late . I 'm going to visit my cousin who lives near here . I will sleep there tonight . " " Thank you , Mustafa , " Louis said . " For trying . " " My pleasure . " He smiled and bowed . " Do not leave on my account . " They watched Mustafa 's lantern bob across the field . " That farmer is probably his cousin , " Ingrid said bitterly . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start a civil war , finish your wine . I 've brought dessert . " " Okay . Then tell me . " " Tell you ? " " About the project . I do n't want to go back to Giza , so you 'll have to tell me here . " " Lay back , " he said . " You 'll need to see the sky . " Louis lay down next to her on his side and turned to look at her . " You are a pharaoh . In death , you lie like this . " He crossed her arms against her chest . " And this , this is your tomb . A huge chamber . But you can not see all the stars we see tonight . You see a few stars only ; they come into your chamber through long little tunnels , too small for a human . For a long time these tunnels were a mystery . We could not see where they went , what their purpose was . Now we have built a camera that travels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not see with our own eyes . Our little rabbit has found something quite incredible : through the tunnels , stars shine on you like beams . And they are not just any stars that shine into your chamber . Your ancient engineers have worked it out so that the stars of Osiris , the god of the afterlife , shine on your sarcophagus , inviting you to heaven . There , there and there , you see ? " " Orion 's belt . " " And with your tomb , with the pyramids , you have mimicked the same constellation , creating a plan of heaven on earth , for they are placed in the exact position of the stars . A perfect mirror . " " I know this part . Tell me the really secret stuff . The stuff you have n't made public . " " Ah , not yet . For that you will have to wait . " Louis touched her cheek with the back of his hand . The air blew softly across the field . They stayed close on the blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the night was pierced with layers and layers of stars . " When I was a girl , I used to think they were trying to break through a dome of black velvet . It was a prison and they were prisoners . They hurled the sharpest part of themselves at the fabric and stuck there , bleeding their light down to us . The night was there to tell us how hard they tried to break free . " " And you , what are you hurling yourself at ? " " I do n't know , " she said quietly . She moved closer to him , resting her head on his arm . They stayed until the air grew cold . Louis wrapped Ingrid in the blanket and they drove through the darkness back to Cairo . " The desert will lose a star when you go , " Louis said when they reached the hotel . He dug into his pocket . " I will miss you . Your lady pharaoh will miss you . Even Mustafa will miss you . " He opened Ingrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with you . Think about us when you are surrounded by snow . "
