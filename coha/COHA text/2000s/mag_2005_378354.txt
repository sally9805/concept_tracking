Jenny Moran , 41 , a sales executive in Ocean County , N.J. , admits to being obsessed with her weight . But she was shocked when her 3 1/2-year-old daughter suddenly began weighing herself several times a day . " I never thought she was paying attention , " Moran says ruefully . <P> Moran has reason to be concerned . Study after study has found that mothers who are fixated on their body image are more likely to have daughters with eating disorders than less self-conscious moms . Sure , you can blame the media for imposing a parade of surgically enhanced pop icons on your impressionable child , but the real danger to her self-image comes from closer to home : you ! <P> Research shows that 80% of American women check out  --  and disapprove of  --  their reflections minutes after waking . On any given day , 45% say they are dieting . Scarier yet , a 1992 study found that 46% of girls 9 to 11 say they are " sometimes " or " very often " on a diet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " We model our mothers , " says psychology professor Lora Jacobi , who teaches a class on eating disorders at all-women Hollins University in Virginia . Of the students attracted to her class  --  typically those struggling with eating issues  --  virtually all report that their mothers were excessively worried about their size . <P> Your daughters are watching you , according to Jacobi . They observe you trying on jeans , overhear you grousing to your friends . They notice what you eat . If you declare yourself " good " for eating only salad and " bad " for eating cookies , they will judge their own goodness and badness the same way . <P> That was the case for Kristen Cole , a publicist in Northampton , Mass. , who grew up watching her mother diet . Cake was pronounced " decadent . " Cole , 33 , believes such behavior helped pave the way for her struggles with anorexia and bulimia , which began at 12 . <P> To avoid passing on an unhealthy obsession , it 's wise to deal with weight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyllis Cohen , a co-author of You Have to Say I 'm Pretty , You 're My Mother . And it 's better to talk about bodies in terms of their strength and abilities rather than their appearance . If you 're upset about gaining weight , Cohen urges , do n't turn your anger inward . Self-loathing , most experts agree , is the root cause of eating disorders . <P> Do you hate your hips ? Your butt ? Be careful what you say . Self-contempt passes from generation to generation . Just recently , on a New York State college campus , Emily , 20 , recoiled when her boyfriend squeezed her , exclaiming , " I love your arms ! " Emily hated them . " My mother thought her arms were fat and flabby , " she explains . " She 'd never wear anything sleeveless . I thought that I was like her . " <P> For your daughter to accept her body , you have to accept your own , insists Linda Perlman Gordon , a co-author of Why Girls Talk  --  And What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are more than just a pretty face . " <P> What if you do n't believe that ? Start working on it . Try to like your body , and do n't hide it from your daughter , suggests Boston family therapist Carleton Kendrick . " When she sees you in your bra and panties playing with the dog , she gets the message you 're comfortable with your body and your sexuality , " Kendrick says .
