Chapter One With jingling spurs a tall cowboy stalked out of the post office to confront his three comrades crossing the wide street from the saloon opposite . " Look heah , " he said , shoving a letter under their noses . " Which one of you longhorns has wrote her again ? " From a gay careless trio his listeners suddenly grew blank , then intensely curious . They stared at the handwriting on the letter . " Tex , I 'm a son-of-a-gun if it ai n't from Missouri ! " ejaculated Andy Smith , his lean red face bursting into a smile . " It shore is , " declared Nevada . " From Missouri ! " echoed Panhandle Ames . " Wal ? " queried Tex , almost with a snort . The three cowboys jerked up to look from Tex to one another , and then back at Tex . " It 's from her , " went on Tex , his voice hushing on the pronoun . " You-all know thet handwritin ' . Now how aboot this deal ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolmarm . Some one of you has double-crossed the outfit . " Loud and unified protestations of innocence emanated from his comrades . But it was evident Tex did not trust them , and that they did not trust him or each other . " Say , boys , " said Panhandle suddenly . " I see Beady inthere lookin ' darn ' sharp at us . Let 's get off in the woods somehow . " " Back to the bar , " replied Nevada . " I reckon us 'll all need stimulants . " " Beady ! " ejaculated Tex , as they turned across the street . " He could be to blame as much as any of us . " " Shore . It 'd be more like Beady , " replied Nevada . " But , Tex , your mind ai n't workin ' . Our lady friend from Missouri has wrote before without gettin ' any letter from us . " " How do we know thet ? " demanded Tex suspiciously . " Shore the boss 's typewriter is a puzzle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gee , Tex , you need a drink , " returned Panhandle peevishly . They entered the saloon and strode to the bar , where from all appearances Tex was not the only one to seek artificial stimulus strength . Then they repaired to a corner , where they took seats and stared at the letter Tex threw down before them . " From Missouri , all right , " said Panhandle wearily , studying the postmark . " Kansas City , Missouri . " " It 's her writin ' , " added Nevada in awe . " Shore I 'd know thet out of a million letters . " " Ai n't you goin ' to read it to us ? " queried Andy Smith . " Mister Frank Owens , " replied Tex , reading from the address on the letter . " Springer 's Ranch . Beacon , Arizona ... Boys , this heah Frank Owens is all of us . " " Huh ! Mebbe he 's a darn ' sight more , " added Andy . " Looks like a low-down trick we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hawk-like head . " Heah he reads in a Kansas City paper aboot a schoolteacher wantin ' a job out in dry Arizonie . And he ups an ' writes her an ' gets her a-rarin ' to come . Then , when she writes an ' tells us she 's not over forty , then us quits like yellow coyotes . An ' we four anyhow shook hands on never writin ' her again . Wal , somebody did , an ' I reckon you-all think me as big a liar as I think you . But thet ai n't the point . Heah 's another letter to Mister Owens an ' I 'll bet my saddle it means trouble . Shore , I 'm plumb afraid to read it . " " Say , give it to me , " demanded Andy . " I ai n't afraid of any woman . " Tex snatched the letter out of Andy 's hand . " Cowboy , you 're too poor educated to read letters from ladies , " observed Tex . " Gim me a knife , somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressively spread out the letter and read laboriously : Kansas City , Mo . June 15 Dear Mr. Owens : Your last letter has explained away much that was vague and perplexing in your other letters . It has inspired me with hope and anticipation . I shall not take time now to express my thanks , but hasten to get ready to go West . I shall leave tomorrow and arrive at Beacon on June 19 at 4:30 p.m . You see I have studied the timetable . Yours very truly , Jane Stacey Profound silence followed Tex 's perusal of the letter . The cowboys were struck dumb . But suddenly Nevada exploded . " My Gawd , fellers , today 's the Nineteenth ! " " Wal , Springer needs a schoolmarm at the ranch , " finally spoke up the practical Andy . " There 's half a dozen kids growin ' up without any schoolin ' , not to talk about other ranches . I heard the boss say this hisself . " " Who the hell did it ? " demanded Tex in a rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in hollerin ' aboot thet now ? " returned Nevada . " It 's done . She 's comin ' . She 'll be on the Limited . Reckon us 're got five hours . It ai n't enough . What 'll we do ? " " I can get awful drunk in thet time , " contributed Panhandle nonchalantly . " Ahuh ! An ' leave it all to us , " retorted Tex scornfully . " But we got to stand pat on this heah deal . Do n't you know this is Saturday an ' thet Springer will be in town ? " " Aw , Lord ! We 're all goin ' to get fired , " declared Panhandle . " Serves us right for listenin ' to you , Tex . Us can all gamble this trick hatched in your head . " " Not my haid more'n yours or anybody , " returned Tex hotly . " Say , you locoed cowpunchers , " interposed Nevada . " What 'll we do ? " " Shore is bad , " sighed Andy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell Springer . " " But , Tex , the boss 'd never believe us about not followin ' the letters up . He 'd fire the whole outfit . " " But he 'll have to be told somethin ' , " returned Panhandle stoutly . " Shore he will , " went on Tex . " I 've an idea . It 's too late now to turn this poor schoolmarm back . An ' somebody 'll have to meet her . Somebody 's got to borrow a buckboard an ' drive her out to the ranch . " " Excuse me ! " replied Andy . And Panhandle and Nevada echoed him . " I 'll ride over on my hoss , an ' see you-all meet the lady , " Andy added . Tex had lost his scowl , but he did not look as if he favorably regarded Andy 's idea . " Hang it all ! " he burst out hotly . " Ca n't some of you gents look at it from her side of the fence ? Nice fix for any woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this mess . If I ever find out ... " " Go on with your grand idea , " interposed Nevada . " You-all come with me . I 'll get a buckboard . I 'll meet the lady an ' do the talkin ' . I 'll let her down easy . An ' if I cai n't head her back , we 'll fetch her out to the ranch an ' then leave it up to Springer . Only we wo n't tell her or him or anybody who 's the real Frank Owens . " " Tex , that ai n't so plumb bad , " declared Andy admiringly . " What I want to know is who 's goin ' go do the talkin ' to the boss ? " queried Panhandle . " It might n't be so hard to explain now . But after drivin ' up to the ranch with a woman ! You-all know Springer 's shy . Young an ' rich , like he is , an ' a bachelor ... he 's been fussed over so he 's plumb afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a middle-aged schoolmarm who 's romantic an ' mushy ! My Gawd , I say send her home on the next train . " " Pan , you 're wise on hosses an ' cattle , but you do n't know human nature , an ' you 're daid wrong about the boss , " rejoined Tex . " We 're in a bad fix , I 'll admit . But I lean more to fetchin ' the lady up than sendin ' her back . Somebody down Beacon way would get wise . Mebbe the schoolmarm might talk . She 'd shore have cause . An ' suppose Springer hears about it ... that some of us or all of us played a low-down trick on a woman . He 'd be madder at that than if we fetched her up . Likely he 'll try to make amends . The boss may be shy on girls but he 's the squarest man in Arizona . My idea is we 'll deny any of us is Frank Owens , an ' we 'll meet Miss ... Miss ... what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up to the ranch , an ' let her do the talkin ' to Springer . " During the next several hours , while Tex searched the town for a buckboard and team he could borrow , the other cowboys wandered from the saloon to the post office and back again , and then to the store , the restaurant , and all around . The town had gradually filled up with Saturday visitors . " Boys , there 's the boss , " suddenly broke out Andy , pointing , and he ducked into the nearest doorway , which happened to be that of another saloon . It was half full of cowboys , ranchers , Mexicans , tobacco smoke , and noise . Andy 's companions had rushed pell-mell after him , and not until they all got inside did they realize that this saloon was a rendezvous for cowboys decidedly not on friendly terms with Springer 's outfit . Nevada was the only one of the trio who took the situation nonchalantly . " Wal , we 're in , an ' what the hell do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remarked , quite loud enough to be heard by others besides his friends . Naturally they lined up at the bar , and this was not a good thing for young men who had an important engagement and who must preserve sobriety . After several rounds of drinks had appeared , they began to whisper and snicker over the possibility of Tex meeting the boss . " If only it does n't come off until Tex gets our forty-year-old schoolmarm from Missouri with him in the buckboard ! " exclaimed Panhandle in huge glee . " Shore . Tex , the handsome galoot , is most to blame for this mess , " added Nevada . " Thet cowboy wo n't be above makin ' love to Jane , if he thinks we 're not around . But , fellows , we want to be there . " " Would n't miss seein ' the boss meet Tex for a million , " said Andy . Presently a tall striking-looking cowboy , with dark face and small bright eyes like black beads , detached himself from a group of noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Howdy , men , " he greeted them , " what you-all doin ' in here ? " He was coolly impertinent , and his action and query noticeably stilled the room . Andy and Pan-handle leaned back against the bar . They had been in such situations before and knew who would do the talking for them . " Howdy , Jones , " replied Nevada coolly and carefully . " We happened to bust in here by accident . Reckon we 're usually more particular what kind of company we mix with . " " Ahuh ! Springer 's outfit is shore a stuck-up one , " sneered Beady Jones in a quite loud tone . " So stuck up they wo n't even ride around drift fences . " Nevada slightly changed his position . " Beady , I 've had a couple of drinks an ' ai n't very clearheaded , " drawled Nevada . " Would you mind talkin ' so I can understand you ? " " Bah ! You savvy all right , " declared Jones sarcastically . " I 'm tellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell your yaller-headed Texas pard . " " Now you 're speakin ' English , Beady . Tex an ' me are pards , shore . An ' I 'll take it kind of you to get this talk out of your system . You seem to be chock full . " " You bet I 'm full an ' I 'm a-goin ' to bust ! " shouted Jones , whose temper evidently could not abide the slow cool speech with which he had been answered . " Wal , before you bust , explain what you mean by Springer 's outfit not ridin ' around drift fences . " " Easy . You just cut through wire fences , " retorted Jones . " Beady , I hate to call you a low-down liar , but that 's what you are . " " You 're another ! " yelled Jones . " I seen your Texas Jack cut our drift fence . " Nevada struck out with remarkable swiftness and force . He knocked Jones over upon a card table , with which he crashed to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before some of his comrades rushed to him , and helped him up . Then , black in the face and cursing savagely , he jerked for his gun . He got it out , but , before he could level it , two of his friends seized him , and wrestled with him , talking in earnest alarm . But Jones fought them . " Ya damn ' fool ! " finally yelled one of them . " He 's not packin ' a gun . It 'd be murder . " That brought Jones to his senses , although certainly not to calmness . " Mister Nevada ... next time you hit town you 'd better come heeled , " he hissed between his teeth . " Shore . An ' thet 'll be bad for you , Beady , " replied Nevada curtly . Panhandle and Andy drew Nevada out to the street , where they burst into mingled excitement and anger . Their swift strides gravitated toward the saloon across from the post office . When they emerged sometime later , they were arm in arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the one main street of Beacon , not in the least conspicuous on a Saturday afternoon . As they were neither hilarious nor dangerous , nobody paid any attention to them . Springer , their boss , met them , gazed at them casually , and passed without sign of recognition . If he had studied the boys closely , he might have received an impression that they were hugging a secret , as well as each other . In due time the trio presented themselves at the railroad station . Tex was there , nervously striding up and down the platform , now and then looking at his watch . The afternoon train was nearly due . At the hitching rail below the platform stood a new buckboard and a rather spirited team of horses . The boys , coming across the wide square , encountered this evidence of Tex 's extremity , and struck a posture before it . " Livery stable outfit , by gosh , " said Andy . " Son-of-a-gun if it ai n't , " added Panhandle with a huge grin . " Thish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada . Then Tex espied them . He stared . Suddenly he jumped straight up . After striding to the edge of the platform , with face as red as a beet , he began to curse them . " Whash mashes , ole pard ? " asked Andy , who appeared a little less stable than his comrades . Tex 's reply was another volley of expressive profanity . And he ended with : " ... you-all yellow quitters to get drunk an ' leave me in the lurch . But you got ta get away from heah . I shore wo n't have you aboot when thet train comes . " " Tex , your boss is in town lookin ' for you , " said Nevada . " I do n't care a damn , " replied Tex with fire in his eye . " Wait till he shees you , " gurgled Andy . " Tex , he jest ambled past us like we was n't gennelmen , " added Panhandle . " Never sheen us a-tall . " " No wonder , you drunken cowpunchers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to clear out of heah . " " But , pard , we just want to shee you meet our Jane from Missouri , " replied Andy . " If you-all ai n't a lot of four-flushes , I 'll eat my chaps ! " burst out Tex hotly . Just then a shrill whistle announced the train . " You can sneak off now , " he went on , " an ' leave me to face the music . I always knew I was the only gentleman in Springer 's outfit . " The three cowboys did not act upon Tex 's sarcastic suggestion , but they hung back , looking at once excited and sheepish and hugely delighted . The long gray dusty train pulled into the station , and stopped . There was only one passenger for Springer-a woman-and she alighted from the coach near where the cowboys stood waiting . She was not tall and she was much too slight for the heavy valise the porter handed to her . Tex strode grandly toward her . " Miss ... Miss Stacey , ma'am ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she replied . " Are you Mister Owens ? " Evidently the voice was not what Tex had ex- pected and it disconcerted him . " No , ma'am , I ... I 'm not Mister Owens , " he said . " Please let me take your bag .... I 'm Tex Dillon , one of Springer 's cowboys . An ' I 've come to meet you ... an ' fetch you out to the ranch . " " Thank you , but I ... I expected to be met by Mister Owens , " she replied . " Ma'am , there 's been a mistake ... I 've got to tell you ... there ai n't any Mister Owens , " blurted out Tex manfully . " Oh ! " she said with a little start . " You see , it was this way , " went on the confused cowboy . " One of Springer 's cowboys ... not me ... wrote them letters to you , signin ' his name Owens . There ai n't no such named cowboy in this county . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my hands ... all by accident , ma'am , it sure was . I took my three friends heah ... I took them into my confidence . An ' we all came down to meet you . " She moved her head and evidently looked at the strange trio of cowboys Tex had pointed out as his friends . They came forward then , but not eagerly , and they still held to each other . Their condition , not to consider their immense excitement , could not have been lost even upon a tenderfoot from Missouri . (
