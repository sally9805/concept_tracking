The relaxing scent of lavender in the hand cream that Jeanette Brioche was massaging into her cramped fingers did absolutely nothing to calm her jittery nerves . A few hours ago Maddie Maddox , her boss at The Corner Spa , had scheduled a meeting for six o'clock , immediately after Jeanette was due to finish with her last client . Maddie had n't said what it was about , but her grim expression suggested it was n't a celebration , something she and her friends Dana Sue and Helen organized at the drop of a hat . <p> Since Jeanette tended to be a worrier who saw disaster around every corner , she decided to get this over with even though it was n't quite six . Her stomach knotted with dread , she walked down the hall to Maddie 's office . <p> After tapping on the partially open door , Jeanette stepped inside to chaos . A disheveled Maddie was holding a wriggling six-month-old Cole in her arms and trying to feed him , while two-year-old Jessica Lynn ran wildly around the room , knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-organized folders were in a chaotic heap , and samples from their suppliers were scattered everywhere . A topless bottle of hand lotion had been upended . <p> " Help ! " Maddie said to Jeanette , who promptly scooped up Jessica Lynn and tickled her until the child dissolved into giggles . <p> " Having a bad day ? " Jeanette inquired , feeling her stomach unknot as the toddler patted her cheek with sticky fingers that smelled of rose-scented hand lotion . The more time she spent around Jessica Lynn and Cole , as well as Helen 's little girl , however , the louder the ticking of Jeanette 's biological clock seemed to get . The alarm had n't gone off yet , but she sensed it was about to when the scent of baby powder started to smell better to her than the herbal aromas in the spa . <p> " A bad day , a bad week and more than likely a bad month , " Maddie replied . <p> The weary response pretty much confirmed the reason for her earlier grim expression . Maddie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago and now had two more . Her oldest son , Ty , was a sophomore at Duke and star of the school 's baseball team . Kyle was in high school and finally regaining his equilibrium after Maddie 's divorce from his dad , and Katie had just turned nine and was only marginally impressed with being a big sister , rather than the baby of the family . <p> There was no question that Maddie had her hands full , even without taking into account that she ran The Corner Spa , which was a thriving fitness club and day spa for residents of Serenity , South Carolina , and beyond . Jeanette could n't imagine how she juggled all those balls in the air . Most days she did it with aplomb . Today she looked completely frazzled . <p> " Want me to take our girl here and give her a beauty treatment ? " she asked Maddie , even as Jessica Lynn struggled to break free . <p> " Actually , Cal should be here any second to pick them up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Just as she spoke , the man in question strode into the room , sized up the situation with a grin and took the squirming Jessica Lynn from Jeanette . <p> " How 's my favorite girl ? " he asked , tossing the toddler into the air , then planting a loud kiss on her cheek that had Jessica Lynn squealing with delight . <p> " I thought I was your favorite girl , " Maddie grumbled with feigned annoyance . <p> Seemingly oblivious to his wife 's mussed hair , lack of makeup and formula-splotched blouse , Cal set the two-year-old down and then leaned down to give Maddie a long , lingering kiss . " You are my favorite woman , " he told Maddie . " And that is much , much better . " <p> Jeanette watched enviously as Maddie touched his cheek in response and their eyes locked . It was as if the two of them were alone in the room . Dana Sue and Ronnie Sullivan , and Helen Decatur and Erik Whitney were equally smitten . Never in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples shared . It was little wonder that Jeanette almost sighed aloud with longing whenever she was around any of them . <p> In fact , their happiness was almost enough to convince her to give relationships another try . She 'd been out of action for three years now , ever since she 'd dumped the guy who 'd resented her commitment to The Corner Spa . With Cal , Ronnie and Erik all devoted to their wives and supportive of their careers , Jeanette knew it was possible to find a man like that . She simply had n't been that lucky yet . <p> Finally , her cheeks pink , Maddie tore her gaze away from her husband . " Nice save , Coach Maddox , " she said , referring to Cal 's role as the high school 's baseball coach and her son 's onetime mentor . " Now , would you get these two little munchkins out of here so I can have an intelligent conversation with Jeanette ? " <p> " Sure thing , " Cal said , putting baby Cole in his stroller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Want me to pick up something from Sullivan 's for dinner ? " <p> Maddie nodded . " I 've already called . Dana Sue will have a take-out order waiting for you . Just park in the alley and poke your head in the kitchen . She or Erik will bring it out . " <p> " Got it , " Cal said , grinning as he gave her a mock salute . " See you later . Have a good evening , Jeanette . Do n't let her talk you into anything . " <p> " Hush , " Maddie ordered , giving him a stern look , then shooing him out of the office . <p> Jeanette regarded Maddie suspiciously when she shut the door behind her husband . " What are you planning to talk me into ? " <p> " Oh , do n't listen to him , " Maddie said , though her expression remained vaguely guilty . " It 's no big deal . " <p> Which meant it was , Jeanette concluded . She knew Maddie pretty well after working with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-oiled machine thanks in no small measure to Maddie 's ability to minimize the difficulty of the assignments she was handing out to the staff . She could sweet-talk with the best of the southern belles . Jeanette had learned to be wary of that dismissive tone . <p> " Talk , " Jeanette ordered . <p> " Now that I think about it , it 's too nice to stay inside . Why do n't we get a couple of glasses of sweet tea and talk on the patio , " Maddie suggested , already striding out of the office and straight for the little cafT that was part of the spa . <p> Jeanette trailed along behind , the knot of dread back in her stomach . <p> After they were seated in the shade of a giant pin oak , which blocked most of the rays of the setting sun , Maddie took a long sip of her tea , sighed with contentment , then gave Jeanette a bright smile that seemed a little forced . " How 's business ? " <p> Jeanette almost laughed aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I do . Come on , Maddie . Just spill it . What 's on your mind ? " <p> Maddie set her tea carefully on the table and leaned forward , her expression earnest . " You know I pretty much have my hands full lately , right ? " <p> " Of course I do , " Jeanette said . No sooner were the words out of her mouth than real alarm set in . " You 're not quitting , are you ? " <p> " Heavens , no , " Maddie said . " The Corner Spa is as important to me as it is to Helen and Dana Sue . I 'm proud of what we 've accomplished here , and I 'm including you in that . You 've done an amazing job with the spa services . I have no intention of abandoning ship . " <p> " Thank goodness . " Jeanette sat back with a sigh of relief . She 'd run the spa both times that Maddie had been on maternity leave . She knew she could handle the day-to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of spa services was enough responsibility to suit her . Massages , facials , pedicures and manicures , those were all things she 'd been trained to do , treatments she understood . As far as she was concerned , the gym was little better than a torture chamber best left to the excellent personal trainers on staff . And the paperwork and marketing involved with keeping this place on the cutting edge in the region were beyond her expertise . Besides , she liked the daily interaction with the clients . Maddie rarely ever got to leave her office . <p> " Okay , let 's back up , " Maddie said . " All I was trying to say is that Jessica Lynn and Cole require huge amounts of attention right now , to say nothing of keeping Kyle and Katie on track . And I 'm still more or less a newlywed . " She grinned . " Or at least Cal always makes me feel like one . " <p> " I can see that , " Jeanette said wryly . <p> " Bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Okay , " Jeanette said cautiously . <p> " The Corner Spa 's now one of the most successful businesses in town , which gives us a certain responsibility , " Maddie continued . " We need to be community leaders , so to speak . " <p> Jeanette nodded . <p> " Which means one of us needs to be involved in town activities and events . " She regarded Jeanette earnestly . " We ca n't get away with just writing a check or participating . We need to take a leadership position , serve on committees , that kind of thing . " <p> Jeanette 's eyes widened as understanding finally dawned . " Oh , no , " she said , the knot tightening . " You 're not about to suggest what I think you are , are you ? " <p> Maddie regarded her innocently . " I have no idea . What are you thinking ? " <p> " Christmas , " Jeanette said , barely able to utter the word without a shudder . <p> Like all holidays , Christmas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ever seen in a staging of The Nutcracker , the arrival of Santa , musical performances by local choirs , candy canes and small token gifts for every child in town . The whole town sparkled with lights , and lawn displays ranged from tasteful to garish . The residents of Serenity loved it all . They embraced the season with the wide-eyed enthusiasm of a five-year-old . <p> Not so Jeanette . Christmas in her life was something to be endured , a holiday season to survive , not a time for rejoicing or celebrating or mingling with neighbors . It had been that way for years now . In fact , most years she tried timing her vacation to the holiday season and spending it holed up with DVDs of all the movies she 'd missed the previous year . <p> " No way , " she told Maddie now . " Not a chance . I am not getting involved with the Christmas festival . " <p> " Come on , Jeanette , please , " Maddie begged . " It 's a few meetings , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the church choirs invited to sing . You 've been here long enough to know the drill . And you 're one of the most organized people I know . " <p> " And the least likely human being on the planet to want to do this , " Jeanette said just as earnestly . " Really , Maddie , you do not want me anywhere near the town 's holiday plans . I give new meaning to bah-humbug . If it were up to me , we 'd cancel Christmas . " <p> Maddie looked genuinely shaken . " Why ? How can you not love Christmas ? " <p> " I just do n't , okay ? " Jeanette said tightly . " I ca n't do this for you , Maddie . I ca n't . Anything else , but not this . I 'll watch your kids , take on extra duties around here , whatever you need , but I wo n't be involved with the festival . " <p> " But  --  " <p> " I wo n't do it , Maddie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in her three years at The Corner Spa , Jeanette stood up and walked out on her boss , leaving Maddie openmouthed with shock . <p> Tom McDonald had been town manager of Serenity for one hour and fifteen minutes when Mayor Howard Lewis walked into his office , plopped his pudgy body into a chair and announced , " Let 's talk about Christmas . " <p> Tom leveled a withering gaze at him that was intended to nip that idea right in the bud . " Do n't you think we should be focusing on the budget , Howard ? That comes up for a vote at the next council meeting and I need to be up to speed on what the priorities are around Serenity . " <p> " I 'll tell you what the top priority is , " Howard replied with single-minded determination . " Christmas . We do it up big here in Serenity . Needs to be done right , so you need to call a meeting now . Get those chamber of commerce people and a few business leaders involved . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to figure out the best way to say no , Howard 's expression turned thoughtful . <p> " Look , " Howard said , " we could use some new decorations for the square , now that there are a few new businesses downtown . Maybe some of those big lighted snowflakes . I 'm thinking downtown is where this year 's celebration ought to be , just like the old days . The park 's great , but there 's something about a town square that just goes with an old-fashioned Christmas , do n't you think ? " <p> Tom ignored the question . " Are new decorations in the current budget ? " he asked , trying to be practical and to avoid the quagmire of admitting his own distaste for the holidays . <p> " I doubt it , " Howard replied with a shrug . " But there 're always a few dollars here and there that can be used for emergencies . Discretionary funds , is n't that what you call them ? " <p> " Snowflakes hardly qualify as an emergency purchase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have many discussions like this during his tenure in Serenity . If so , it was going to be a frustrating experience . <p> Howard waved off his objections . " You 'll find a way , I 'm sure . The point is to get started on this now . " <p> " It 's September , Howard , " Tom reminded him , his dread growing in direct proportion to Howard 's unwavering determination . <p> Howard waved off the reminder . " And it takes time to get things organized , especially when you have to rely on volunteers . Surely you know that . Your rTsumT cited all that organizational experience you have . Use it . " <p> " It seems to me that since you have so much enthusiasm for this project , you should be the one in charge , " Tom said , unable to keep the desperate note out of his voice . Another minute of even thinking about pulling together a Christmas celebration and he 'd be sweating openly . <p> He 'd grown up in a household that began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorators who made every downstairs room in his family 's Charleston household a designer 's Christmas showcase before the round of social occasions began right after Thanksgiving . Heaven forbid that he or his sisters actually try to unwrap one of the packages on display under any of the lavishly decorated trees . Most were nothing more than empty boxes . Like a lot of things that went on in the McDonald home , it was all about show , not substance . <p> He was aware that Howard was studying him with a narrowed gaze . " You got something against Christmas ? " the mayor inquired . <p> " In the religious context , absolutely nothing , " Tom said quickly . " I 'm just saying that organizing a bunch of decorations and such is not an effective use of my time . Then there 's the whole issue of religious displays on public property , separation of church and state and all that . We need to be careful . The courts are ruling against a lot of these displays . " <p> " Nonsense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects to Christmas . " He stood up . " I 'll want to see a report on your progress with this before next Thursday 's council meeting . Understood ? " <br> Continues ...
