The Letters by Luanne Rice and Joseph Monninger <br> 978-0-553-80741-7 <br> November 6 <br> Dear Hadley , <br> I made it . I suppose it would be more accurate to say I can see how I will make it in the next few days . I am at the last stage , as far as the planes can take me , at a fishing camp called Laika Star . From here I travel by dogsled , a prospect that both thrills me and fills me with no small amount of fear . You remember how I loved Jack London and read it to Paul when he was ten ? Suddenly the prospect of a real mush stands before me , and I am not as intrepid as I believed myself to be . Strange when dreams come face to face with reality . I am to meet the dog driver tomorrow . She will go over my equipment and supply anything else that I need . It should take about ten days , which is a long time to be in the Alaskan bush in winter . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you would like this country . Alaska is vast and lonely and haunting . It 's one thing to hear about it , another to travel it . Most of the state 's population lives near Anchorage or Fairbanks . Good roads connect those two cities , but the rest of the state relies on planes . You know all that , of course . I 'm sorry if I 'm telling you more or less than you need to know . It 's been years  --  back to our courtship , really  --  since I wrote you a true letter . And I am beyond email , or any electronic communication . Even to call would take a satellite phone , and I suspect we should stand by our decision to take a break for a while to sort out what our marriage means or how it should end . Letters seem like a more reasoned way to communicate . I hope you understand and I hope you 'll write back . <br> I also wanted to say I know you think this trip is a bad idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see where he died , honey . I just do . I do n't know if it will change anything , or bring me any peace , but I feel I must do it . I ca n't go forward until I know more . I want to know how he spent his last days , and what he thought and felt , as least as far as such things are knowable . I 'm sorry if my need to do this causes you pain . <br> On a lighter note , I should mention that you would like my cabin . It is a model of efficiency and low-tech elegance . Everything is fashioned out of logs , like a boy 's dream of a Lincoln Log cabin . Martha Stewart meets Sergeant Preston of the Yukon ! A Vermont Castings stove sits in one corner , and you can open the doors to the stove and it becomes a fireplace . Beautiful , really . I have it running now and the room smells of cedar and pine and oak . The beds are firm and the linens top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world class , I gather , and they routinely fly in some big names . In the dining room I 've seen pictures of Bobby Knight , the famous basketball coach , and George Bush Sr. The proprietor , a man named Gus  --  should n't all proprietors be named Gus ?  --  pointed out a dozen more photographs , but I just nodded and did my best to appear impressed , because clearly I was supposed to know who they were . TV stars , I guess . I did n't recognize any of them , and that simply confirms that I am hopelessly out of date . <br> I am eager to hear your news , but I will understand if you decide not to write back . I am not trying to gloss over the troubles we 've had in our marriage . I understand that we may not be capable of mending our life together . I want you to know that I am sorry for my part in our rifts , and that as hurtful as I have been at times , it was never my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but I did not mean to fail . <br> More tomorrow . <br> Sam <br> November 7 <br> Hadley  --  <br> I have a way to get the mail quickly to you , as remarkable as that must seem for someone writing from the Alaska outback . Gus puts his mail on the regular plane to Anchorage , but the bush plane operators provide a FedEx connection . FedEx does an overnight thing , and if it all hits correctly you can get mail to anyone in the lower forty-eight in about three days . They claim when it works right it is faster , if more expensive , than regular mail . So I want to get this in an envelope before I go to bed . <br> Before I tell you about meeting the dogs , and the wonder of all that , I have to tell you a funny anecdote . It turns out that you have to feed a woodstove all night ! I must sound like a bumbling idiot , but I went to bed without giving it a thought , assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup heat . I woke at two in the morning and I have never been colder in my life ! I do n't know what I was thinking . Plain stupid , really . Stocked properly , the stove can easily make it through the night and keep the cabin warm , but I did n't think twice before going to sleep . So , you would have watched your husband on his hands and knees , blowing carefully onto a twist of paper and tinder , trying to get the last dying embers to flame up . I did it , too , and I have never seen a more welcome sight than those first few flames . I fed that fire with more tenderness , more attention , than I have lavished on anything in years . ( That sounds horrible . . . I should lavish attention and tenderness on you , should n't I ? ) But you know what I mean . Eventually the fire got going and I filled the stove full , and the cabin is so well insulated it began warming up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermometer on the porch post and saw it had dropped to - 10 . Cold , but not as cold as it will get . Not by a long shot . I climbed back under the blankets , and sat up in bed and gauged the heat as it moved slowly through the cabin . Wonderful , wonderful heat . I tried to go back to sleep , but I felt restless , and a little excited to be meeting the dogs in the morning , so I read a while , The Three Musketeers , of all things , but I could n't quite get involved . I finally gave it up and I slid out of bed one more time to open the doors on the stove . You can imagine the wonderful light the fire gave . I hustled back into bed and watched the flames for a long time and I felt a million things . <br> I felt young , sweetheart . That might sound crazy to you , but I did . Propped up on the pillows , watching the flames , about a dozen Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , us , our student days in Providence . Do you remember that art project the RISD student did on Benefit Street ? He talked the town administrators into letting him cover a block of that beautiful old street with grass sod and then brought in two enormous Jersey cows , their udders virtually dragging on the ground , and for one afternoon and evening the street became a rural countryside again . I thought it was brilliant in its way ; it made us look at the street with a different perspective . Anyway , I 've never told you , but I think that 's the first time I saw you . I know we met later , and we talk about that as our first meeting and I never wanted to spoil that , but I have a memory of you , or a dream , and you are dressed in black  --  a black skirt and a turtleneck  --  and you are riding one of the first English bikes I ever saw , with handlebar brakes , and you ride by on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true or not , but I swear you entered my consciousness that day . You were so beautiful . Your hair was in a French braid and you looked straight ahead , not particularly solid on the bike , and I saw you as if somehow magically you had brought the countryside to good old Providence , and it was something out of Thomas Hardy , a girl with radiant skin , and serious knees , pumping away down the street . I never told you before because I 've never known if I imagined it , or had dreamed it into being , and besides , I remember our real first meeting vividly , too . In any case , you were tremendously present in the cabin with me , alone in Alaska , both of us far down under the covers . <br>  --  Sam <br> Hadley  --  <br> You must think I 've completely lost my mind . <br> After my strange night  --  you really were in the cabin , you know , but a younger you , a college girl you  --  I woke early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives out here by himself . He has a girlfriend , but she refuses to spend the winter so far north . She retreats to Anchorage and visits him now and then , but only when the weather permits . She is a pilot , so she can buzz up here when she likes . Her name is Cindy . She spends the summers here , working as a pilot and a guide . He does all the cooking , the grounds work , and so on . They hire a crew of kids to serve as kitchen help , and they pay them top dollar . It 's prestigious , I gather , to work at Laika Star . The kids pass down the jobs to brothers and sisters . The season is short , but they make a killing because of the fishing . The river near here , the Yankawalett ( an Inuit name ) , has the finest grayling fishing in North America . People try to collect different fish the way old-time hunters collected big-game heads , and grayling , with an outsized dorsal fin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become wildly popular , and plenty of CEOs and corporate bigwigs do n't think twice about dropping a pile of dough to get to remote rivers . That 's how Gus gets by . <br> ( Do n't worry , by the way . . . I have winter rates , which are much more reasonable . ) <br> Gus fixed breakfast in the main lodge . When I asked if it was n't a bit extravagant to keep the lodge heated during the winter , he mentioned that he expected a snowmobile party in ten days ' time , and if he let the heat go out the cold would sink into the wood and it would be the devil to get heated again . Cheaper , he said , to keep it going . So we had the enormous lodge to ourselves , and Gus ate with me  --  ham , bacon , eggs , beans , sourdough toast , and oatmeal . I did n't feel hungry when I sat down at the table , but I ate and ate and ate , and I still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus resembles every minor prospector character in every western you 've ever seen . You know the type : gray beard , sharp , birdy features , a wide , wrinkled forehead , and a pair of red suspenders . Small and wiry . His right index finger is missing at the second joint , and his right foot lags out a little as if he wanted to ease a small dog forward with it . He 's aware that he plays to type , but he 's also perilously close to being a type , so it all works together in a funny sort of way . When he brought in breakfast I expected him to start babbling about gold in them thar hills , but he satisfied himself with sliding the food onto the table and that was that . <br> Good food , too . Nothing fancy , but he took pride in what he served . He told me he has an order in for a haunch of moose meat for the snowmobile party . They asked for it . He 'll make some stews and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here than standard beef , he said , especially in winter . <br> The next part is about Paul . So skip it if it 's too painful to read . But Gus knew a little about the accident from his girlfriend , Cindy , who knows all the pilots . It 's a small world up here , not in land , but in population , so it was n't surprising that he knew a few things . He fished around a little to figure out what I was doing up here by myself in the winter , trying to figure how I would take it , I guess , but then he told me what he knew . So here goes . <br> He never met Paul . Paul waited in Anchorage for three days , hoping to get decent weather . The school year up on the northern slope had a start date of September 1 . I guess it 's customary to buy all your groceries before going that far north , and people do n't think twice about hiring planes . Paul was heading into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus . And the village where Paul was going to teach  --  I ca n't come close to spelling the name , but it 's something like Ukallatahal  --  had the usual problems with alcoholism and domestic abuse and a dozen other things . They also fared miserably with the Alaskan oil rights . That is a very long story  --  and Gus told me most of it  --  but it 's enough to say the village had money from oil rights , lost it , appealed to the government for protection , lost money again , and wound up back where it had begun . <br> Paul had new textbooks for his classes , and a year 's worth of school materials . I like knowing that small detail and I hope you do , too . <br> Gus said the consensus held that ice had brought the plane down . That concurs with the official report . He said that dozens of planes go down every year , most from ice or some outside factor . He even said geese bring some planes down by flocks flying into them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the one Paul was in , and Otters are exceptionally reliable planes . But conditions are difficult and if you get in trouble , as Paul 's plane did , you have nowhere to emergency land unless you can get to a lake . The pilot , from what Gus knew from Cindy , was experienced and steady . Irish Canadian , as you know . ( I 've blocked his name right now . . . ) <br> That 's all so far . I understand you think this quest of mine is self-punishing , or masochistic , but I feel I have to go through with it . I pushed him to do something different , to try something adventurous . And our beautiful son ended up dead . <br> I have to stop now . <br>  --  Sam <br> November 10 <br> Dear Sam , <br> I got your letter . I 'm glad you made it there safely . <br> Thanks , I guess , for letting me know . <br>  --  Hadley <br> Still Nov. 10 . . . <br> Dear Sam , <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , I really am . I ran to catch the mail boat ( yes , you read that right ) , but I was too late . It was just chugging away from the dock , disappearing into the fog . Honestly , it could n't have been more symbolic  --  me standing on the wharf , waving and yelling , while my letter to you disappears into the great unknown . Sound familiar ? Sorry again . I 'll try not to sound bitter . <br> Okay , take two . I got your letter . And you 're right  --  it came fast , via FedEx . The thing was , it went home ( it being home , you probably figured that 's where I 'd be ) . But I 'm not . I 'm in a tiny , drafty , salt-soaked cottage on Monhegan Island . Jenny saw the truck arrive from next door and intercepted the envelope . She had them forward it here , to Monhegan . Expensive way to get mail . I can almost hear your rationale  --  you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you want to keep me up on the details as you learn them . <br> It 's beautiful on the island . I came out at the beginning of October , have been here almost a month and a half now  --  I just knew I needed to get away . I tell myself it 's not because of you , or because you 've undertaken such a journey  --  such a pilgrimage . I honestly believe , with all the soul-searching I can muster ( and you know I can muster plenty  --  no comments , please ) , that my coming here was all on my own , nothing at all to do with you . <br> Are you ready ? I 'm painting again . <br> That 's why I chose Monhegan  --  in the summer , there 's a real , true , working artists ' colony here . By the time I got here , the artists were starting to leave , head home . That 's okay  --  the desolation suits me right now . Jamie Wyeth has a house at one end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I myself have n't seen him . It 's a little how I imagine things might have been in Honfleur back in the days of Monet . . . " Did you see Claude ? " " Claude just picked up his mail . " " Claude is down by the haystacks . " Etc . Jamie has that kind of allure and fame . I do n't care about Jamie 's allure and fame . I just care that I 've picked up a paintbrush again . <br> The cottage is a shambles , but I love it . I rented it from an ad in the Boston Globe  --  two lines mentioning a sunflower garden and a water view . Even when I first got here , the sunflowers were dead . The water view requires jimmying a lock , climbing the ricketiest attic stairs you 've ever seen , and leaning out the window to spy a distant patch of harbor between bare branches and pine boughs . When I called the owner to ask what the hell , he apologized and told me he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the cottage for what sounds to me like a song . Seems he inherited it from his recently deceased mother  --  who was an artist and knew , of course , Jamie . <br> I told him I 'd think it over . The truth , Sam , is that I want it . I can see myself here , and I have n't been able to see myself anywhere . The kitchen smells of linseed oil and turpentine ; the walls are lined with my landlord 's mother 's paintings . She was something of a primitive , but with poetry and soul  --  think Grandma Moses meets Gauguin . With a touch of Georgia O'Keeffe . Sutton , her son and my landlord , said she was a " character , " and something in his tone makes me know there 's much more to it . <br> I feel her presence with me . Almost as if she 's protecting , guiding me into these long , cold months . There 's something about the way the November weather on this island far at sea matches what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she would understand . She signed her paintings " A. " That 's all  --  just A. So I feel I have the ghost of A here with me . <br> She 's with me right now , as I write this letter to you . I think I need her , too . This is n't easy . Reading your letter from Laika Star , my hands are shaking . You 're really there ? Why ? <br> <br> You say you hope I understand , but I do n't . You want me to know you know I think it 's a bad idea , and I do . What good can come from it ? As much time as I 've had to think about it , as hard as you 've tried to persuade me , I still come back to the same thing : Alaska killed him . <br> You asked me to write back ( are n't you sorry ? ) , so that 's what I 'm doing . He was so dear and tender . He loved the outdoors , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the world , but why could n't he have waited to graduate and then done that here in Maine , or New Hampshire , or Arkansas , or Texas , or any of the places Teach for America would have sent him ? Why did he have to choose the most remote place on the globe ? <br> Please do n't let 's keep this up . I ca n't bear going back and forth with you on this ; I hear myself seeming to blame you and realize that 's just what I 'm doing . We loved him more than air . And we buried him . He 's gone , Sam  --  and you being there does nothing to change that . <br> Have a drink with Gus , and turn for home . I 've decided I do n't want the house . You can have it  --  I 'll tell Charlie , and he can work it all out with your lawyer . I really do like it here . The winter might be tough , but I do n't care . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attic and stared at it falling on the harbor . <br>  --  Hadley <br> P.S. If you 're going to write again , send letters to me at <br> 3 Lupine Hill Road <br> Monhegan Island , Maine 04852 <br> You know I do n't agree with you on any of it  --  it 's yourquest , not mine , I never wanted you to go . So I give you permission to ask why I 'm replying in the same way , overnight express . The truth is , I do n't know . Perhaps I just want to do my part in playing out this last act of ours . <br> Be careful . I did n't say that before . <br> But please , can you be careful up there ? We may be apart now , but that does n't mean I want both of you dying in that wilderness . <br> I have to run to catch the boat , to get this off to you . <br>  --  Hadley <br> Continues ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
