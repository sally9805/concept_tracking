The Corellian Queen was a legend : the greatest luxury liner ever to ply the spaceways , an interstellar pleasure palace forever beyond the grasp of all but the galaxy 's super-elite  --  beings whose wealth transcended description . Rumor had it that for the price of a single cocktail in one of the Queen ' s least- exclusive dining clubs , one might buy a starship ; for the price of a meal , one could buy not only the starship , but the port in which it docked , and the factory that had built it . A being could not simply pay for a berth on the Corellian Queen ; mere wealth would never suffice . To embark upon the ultimate journey into hedonistic excess , one first had to demonstrate that one 's breeding and manners were as exquisite as would be the pain of paying one 's bar bill . All of which made the Corellian Queen one of the most irresistible terrorist targets ever : who better to terrorize than the elite of the Elite , the Powers among the powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some presumably unscrupulous routing clerk in the <br> vast midreaches of the Nebula Line corporation quietly offered for <br> sale , to select parties from Kindlabethia to Nar Shaddaa , a hint as to <br> the route of the Corellian Queen ' s upcoming cruise , it attracted considerable interest . <br> Two pertinent facts remained concealed , however , from the winning <br> bidder . The first pertinent fact was that this presumably unscrupulous <br> routing clerk was neither unscrupulous nor , in fact , a <br> routing clerk , but was a skilled and resourceful agent of the intelligence <br> service of the New Republic . The second pertinent fact was <br> that the Corellian Queen was not cruising at all that season , having <br> been replaced by a breakaway disposable shell built to conceal a substantial fraction of a star fighter wing , led by  --  as was customary in such operations  --  the crack pilots of Rogue Squadron . <br> It was approximately the moment that R4-G7 squalled a proximity <br> alarm through his X-wing 's sensor panel and his HUD lit up <br> with image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Derek " Hobbie " Klivian , late of the Alliance to Restore Freedom to <br> the Galaxy , currently of the New Republic , began to suspect that <br> Commander Antilles 's brilliant ambush had never been brilliant at <br> all , not even a little , and he said so . In no uncertain terms . Stripped <br> of its blistering profanity , his comment was " Wedge ? This plan was <br> stupid . You hear me ? Stupid , stupid , stu YOW  --  ! " <br> The yow was a product of multiple cannon hits that disintegrated <br> his right dorsal cannon and most of the extended wing it had been <br> attached to . This kicked his fighter into a tumble that he fought with <br> both hands on the yoke and both feet kicking attitude jets and almost <br> had under control until the pair of the Defenders closest on his tail <br> blossomed into expanding spheres of flame and debris fragments . <br> The twin shock fronts overtook him at exactly the wrong instant and <br> sent him flipping end- over- end straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then tail- on , then head- on <br> again , and so forth . <br> His ship 's comlink crackled as Wedge Antilles 's fighter flashed <br> past him close enough that he could see the grin on the commander 's <br> face . " That 's ' stupid plan , sir , ' Lieutenant . " <br> " I suppose you think that 's funny . " <br> " Well , if he does n't , " put in Hobbie 's wingman , " I sure do . " <br> " When I want your opinion , Janson , I 'll dust your ship and scan <br> for it in the wreckage . " The skewed whirl of stars around his cockpit <br> gave his stomach a yank that threatened to make the slab of smoked <br> terrafin loin he 'd had for breakfast violently reemerge . Struggling <br> grimly with the controls , he managed to angle his ship 's whirl just a <br> hair , which let him twitch his ship 's nose toward the four pursuing <br> marauders as he spun . Red fire lashed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation split open like an overripe <br> snekfruit . <br> Hobbie only dusted one with the cannons , but the pair of <br> proximity- fused flechette torpedoes he had thoughtfully triggered at <br> the same time flared in diverging arcs to intercept the enemy fighters ; <br> these torpedo arcs terminated in spectacular explosions that <br> cracked the three remaining Defenders like rotten snuffle eggs . <br> " Now , that was satisfying , " he said , still fighting his controls to <br> stabilize the crippled X-wing . " Eyeball soufflT ! " <br> " Better watch it , Hobbie  --  keep that up , and somebody might start to <br> think you can fly that thing . " <br> " Are you in this fight , Janson ? Or are you just gon na hang back <br> and smirk while I do all the heavy lifting ? " <br> " Have n't decided yet . " Wes Janson 's X-wing came out of nowhere , <br> streaking in a tight bank across Hobbie 's subjective vertical . " Maybe <br> I can lend a hand . Or , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars leapt from Janson 's torpedo tubes and <br> streaked for the oncoming TIEs . <br> " Uh , Wes ? " Hobbie said , flinching . " Those were n't the flechette <br> torps , were they ? " <br> " Sure . What else ? " <br> " Have you noticed that I 'm currently having just a little trouble <br> maneuvering ? " <br> " What do you mean ? " Janson asked as though honestly puzzled . <br> Then , after a second spent watching Hobbie 's ship tumbling helplessly <br> directly toward his torpedoes ' targets , he said , " Oh . Uh . . . sorry ? " <br> <br> The flechette torpedoes carried by Rogue Squadron had been designed <br> and built specifically for this operation , and they had one primary <br> purpose : to take out TIE Defenders . <br> The TIE Defender was the Empire 's premier space- superiority <br> fighter . It was faster and more maneuverable than the Incom T-65 <br> ( better known as the X-wing ) ; faster even than the heavily modified <br> and updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> heavily armed , packing twin ion cannons to supplement its lasers , as <br> well as dual- use launch tubes that could fire either proton torpedoes <br> or concussion missiles . The shields generated by its twin Novaldex <br> deflector generators were nearly as powerful as those found on capital <br> ships . However , the Defenders were not equipped with particle <br> shields , depending instead on their titanium- reinforced hull to absorb <br> the impact of material objects . <br> Each proton torpedo shell had been loaded with thousands of tiny <br> jagged bits of durasteel , packed around a core of conventional explosive . <br> On detonation , these tiny bits of durasteel became an expanding <br> sphere of shrapnel ; though traveling with respectable velocity of <br> their own , they were most effective when set off in the path of oncoming <br> Defenders , because impact energy , after all , is determined by <br> relative velocity . At star fighter combat speeds , flying into a cloud of <br> durasteel pellets could transform one 's ship from a star fighter into a <br> very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters of the oncoming Defender formation hit <br> the flechette cloud and just . . . shredded . The lateral wingers managed <br> to bank off an instant before they would have been overtaken <br> by two sequential detonations , as the explosion of one Defender 's <br> power core triggered the other three 's cores an eyeblink later , so that <br> the unfortunate Lieutenant Klivian was now tumbling directly <br> toward a miniature plasma nebula that blazed with enough hard radiation <br> to cook him like a bantha steak on an obsidian fry- rock at <br> double noon on Tatooine . <br> " You 're not gon na make it , Hobbie , " Janson called . " Punch out . " <br> " Oh , you 'd like that , would n't you ? " Hobbie snarled under his <br> breath , still struggling grimly with the X-wing 's controls . The <br> fighter 's tumble began to slow . " I 've got it , Wes ! " <br> " No , you do n't ! Punch out , Hobbie  --  PUNCH OUT ! " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! I 'm gon na  --  " He was interrupted <br> by the final flip of his X- wing , which brought his nose into line with <br> the sight of the leading edge of the spherical debris field expanding <br> toward him at a respectable fraction of lightspeed , and Hobbie Klivian , <br> acknowledged master of both profanity and obscenity , human <br> and otherwise , not to mention casual vulgarities from a dozen <br> species and hundreds of star systems , found he had nothing to say <br> except , " Aw , nuts . " <br> He stood the X- wing on its tail , sublights blasting for a tangent , <br> but he had learned long ago that of all the Rogues , he was the one <br> who should know better than to trust his luck . He reached for the <br> eject trigger . <br> Just as his hand found the trigger , the ship jounced and clanged as <br> if he had his head trapped inside a Wookiee dinner gong at nightmeal . <br> The metaphorical Wookiee cook must have been hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and kept getting louder , and <br> the eject still , mysteriously , did n't seem to be working at all . This <br> mystery was solved , however , by the brief shriek of atmosphere <br> through a ragged fist- sized hole in the X- wing 's canopy . This hole <br> was ragged because , Hobbie discovered , the fragment that had made <br> this opening had been slowed by punching through the X- wing 's <br> titanium- alloy ventral armor . Not to mention the X- wing 's control <br> panel , where it had not only ripped away the entire eject trigger assembly , <br> but had vaporized Hobbie 's left hand . <br> He glared at his vacant wrist with more annoyance than shock or <br> panic ; instead of blood or cauterized flesh , his wrist jetted only <br> sparks and smoke from overheated servomotors . He had n't had a <br> real left arm since sometime before Yavin . <br> Of more concern was the continuing shriek of escaping atmosphere , <br> because he discovered that it was coming from his environment <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this sucks . After everything he had survived in the <br> Galactic Civil War , he was about to be killed by a minor equipment <br> malfunction . He amended his previous thought : This really sucks . <br> He did n't bother to say it out loud , because there was n't enough <br> air in his cockpit to carry the sound . <br> There being no other useful thing he could do with his severed <br> left wrist , he jammed it into the hole in his canopy . His suit 's autoseal <br> plastered itself to the jagged edges , but the nitroxy generator did n't <br> seem mollified ; in fact , it was starting to feel like he had an unshielded <br> fusion core strapped to his spine . <br> Oh , yeah , he thought . The other hole . <br> He palmed the cockpit harness 's snap release , twisted , and <br> stretched out his left leg , feeling downward with the toe of his boot . <br> He found a hole  --  and the rising pressure sucked the entire boot <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged to <br> close that hole , too . He felt another impact or two down there , but <br> he could n't really tell if something might have ripped his foot off . <br> It had been a few years since he 'd had his original left leg . <br> With the cockpit sealed , his nitroxy unit gradually calmed down , <br> filling the space with a breathable atmosphere that smelled only <br> faintly of scorched hair , and he began to think he might live through <br> this after all . His only problem now was that he was deharnessed and <br> stretched sideways in an extraordinarily uncomfortable twist that left <br> him unable to even turn his head enough to see where he was going . <br> " Arfour , " he said quietly , " can you please get us back to the PRP ? " <br> His current position did let him see , however , his astromech 's response <br> to the task of navigating toward the primary rendezvous <br> point , which was a spit of gap sparks and a halo of sporadic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome . Which was slightly <br> less than half . <br> He sighed . " Okay , ejection failure . And astromech damage . Crippled <br> here , " he said into his comm . " Awaiting manual pickup . " <br> " Little busy right now , Hobbie . We 'll get to you after we dust these <br> TIEs . " <br> " Take your time . I 'm not going anywhere . Except , y'know , thataway . <br> Slowly . Real slowly . " <br> He spent the rest of the battle hoping for a bit of help from the <br> Force when Wedge sent out the pickup detail . Please , he prayed <br> silently , please let it be Tycho . Or Nin , or Standro . Anyone but Janson . <br> He continued this plea as a sort of meditation , kind of the way <br> Luke would talk about this stuff : he closed his eyes and visualized <br> Wedge himself showing up to tow his X- wing back to the jump <br> point . After a while , he found this image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he cycled through the other <br> Rogues , and when those began to bore him , he decided it 'd be Luke <br> himself . Or Leia . Or , say , Wynssa Starflare , who always managed to <br> look absolutely stellar as the strong , independent damsel- sometimesin- <br> distress in those pre- war Imperial holodramas , because , y'know , <br> as long as he was imagining something that was never gon na happen , <br> he might as well make it entertaining . <br> It turned out to be entertaining enough that he managed to pass <br> the balance of the battle drifting off to sleep with a smile on his face . <br> This smile lasted right up to the point where a particularly brilliant <br> flash stabbed through his eyelids and he awoke , glumly certain <br> that whatever had exploded right next to his ship was finally about to <br> snuff him . But then there came another flash , and another , and with <br> a painful twist of his body he was able to see Wes Janson 's fighter <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see the <br> handheld imager Janson had pressed against his cockpit 's canopy , <br> with which Janson continued to snap picture after picture . <br> Hobbie closed his eyes again . He would have preferred the explosion . <br> " Just had to get a few shots . " Janson 's grin was positively wicked . <br> " You look like some kind of weird cross between a star fighter pilot and a Bat - <br> ravian gumplucker . " <br> Hobbie shook his head exhaustedly ; dealing with Janson 's pathetic <br> excuse for a sense of humor always made him tired . " Wes , I do n't <br> even know what that is . " <br> " Sure you do , Hobbie . A star fighter pilot is a guy who flies an X- wing <br> without getting blown up . Check the Basic Dictionary . Though I can <br> understand how you 'd get confused . " <br> " No , I mean the  --  " Hobbie bit his lip hard enough that he tasted <br> blood . " Um , Wes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you today how much I really , really hate you ? " <br> " Oh , sure  --  your lips say ' I hate you , ' but your eyes say  --  " <br> " That someday I 'll murder you in your sleep ? " <br> Janson chuckled . " More or less . " <br> " It 's all over , huh ? " <br> " This part is . Most of ' em got away . " <br> " How many 'd we lose ? " <br> " Just Eight and Eleven . But Avan and Feylis ejected clean . Nothing a <br> couple weeks in a bacta tank wo n't cure . And then there 's my Batravian <br> gumplucker wingman . . . " <br> " You 're the wingman , knucklehead . Maybe I should say , wing nut . " <br> Hobbie sighed again . " I guess Wedge is happy , anyway . Everything 's <br> proceeding according to plan . . . " <br> " I HATE when you say that . " <br> " Yeah ? How come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . gives me the whingeing jimmies . Let me get <br> this tow cable attached , and you might as well sleep ; it 's a long cruise to the <br> PRP . " <br> " Suits me just fine , " Hobbie said , closing his eyes again . " I have <br> this dream I really want to get back to . . . " <br> " Good job , Wedge . " General Lando Calrissian , commander of <br> Special Operations for the New Republic , nodded grave approval <br> toward the flickering bluish holoform of Wedge Antilles that hovered <br> a centimeter above his console . " No casualties ? " <br> " Nothing serious , General . Hobbie  --  Lieutenant Klivian  --  needs another <br> left hand . . . " <br> Lando smiled . " How many does that make , all told ? " <br> " I 've lost count . How 's it going on your end ? " <br> " Good and less than good . " Lando punched up his readout of the <br> tracking report . " Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> Wedge 's brilliant plan had become brilliant entirely by necessity ; <br> the usual method of locating a hidden marauder base  --  subjecting a <br> captured pilot or two to a neural probe  --  had turned out to be much <br> more difficult than anyone could have anticipated . Shadowspawn <br> seemed very determined to maintain his privacy ; through dozens of <br> raids over nearly two months , many deep inside Republic territory <br> and costing thousands of civilian lives , not one of Shadowspawn 's <br> marauders had ever been taken alive . <br> This was more than a simple refusal to surrender , though the marauders <br> had shown a distressing tendency , when they found themselves <br> in imminent danger , to shout out words to the effect of For <br> Shadowspawn and the Empire ! Forward the Restoration ! and blow themselves <br> up . Forensic engineers examining wreckage of destroyed TIE <br> Defenders hypothesized that the star fighters were equipped with <br> some unexplained type of deadman interlock , which would destroy <br> the ship  --  and obliterate the pilot  --  even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wedge 's brilliant plan had been to conceal <br> hundreds of thousands of miniature solid- state transponders among <br> the flechettes inside Rogue Squadron 's custom- made torpedoes , before <br> giving the marauders a fairly decent pasting and letting the rest <br> escape . Unlike ordinary tracking devices , these transponders gave <br> off no signal of their own  --  thus requiring no power supply , and rendering <br> them effectively undetectable . These transponders were entirely <br> inert until triggered by a very specific subspace signal , which <br> they then echoed in a very specific way . And since the only transponders <br> of this very specific type in the entire galaxy were loaded in <br> Rogue Squadron 's torpedo tubes , drifting at the ambush point in <br> deep space along the Corellian Run , and lodged in various parts of <br> the armored hulls of a certain group of TIE Defenders , locating the <br> system to which said Defenders had fled was actually not complicated <br> at all . <br> Wedge 's holoform took on a vaguely puzzled look . " Taspan . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " <br> " The Inner Rim , off the Hydian Way . " <br> " That would be the less- than- good part . " <br> " Yeah . No straight lanes in or out  --  and most of the legs run <br> through systems still held by Imperials . " <br> " Almost makes you wish for one of Palpatine 's old planet- killers . " <br> " Almost . " Lando 's smile had faded , and he did n't sound like he <br> was joking . " The Empire had a weapons facility on Taspan II  --  it 's <br> where they tested their various designs of gravity- well projectors  --  " <br> " That 's it ! " The image snapped its fingers silently , the sound <br> eliminated by the holoprojector 's noise filter . " The Big Crush ! " <br> <br> Lando nodded . " The Big Crush . " <br> " I heard there was nothing left at Taspan but an asteroid field , like the <br> Graveyard of Alderaan . " <br> " There 's an inner planet  --  Taspan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not well known , but really beautiful ; my parents had a summer <br> house there when I was a kid . " <br> " Any progress on this Shadowspawn character himself ? " <br> " We 've only managed to determine that no one by that name was <br> ever registered as an Imperial official . Clearly an assumed identity . " <br> " The guy 's got to be some kind of nutjob . " <br> " I doubt it . His choice of base is positively inspired ; the debris <br> from the Big Crush has n't had time to settle into stable orbits . " <br> " So it is like the Graveyard of Alderaan . " <br> " It 's worse , Wedge . A lot worse . " <br> Wedge 's image appeared to be giving a low whistle ; the holoprojector 's <br> noise filter screened it out . " Sounds ugly . How are we supposed <br> to get at them ? " <br> " You 're not . " Lando took a deep breath before continuing . " This <br> is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Response <br> Task Force . " <br> Wedge 's image gave a slow , understanding nod . " Hit ' em with our <br> Big Stick , then . Slap ' em good and run like hell . " <br> " It 's the best shot we 've got . " <br> " You 're probably right ; you usually are . But it 'll sting , to not be there . " <br> " Right enough . But we have other problems  --  and the RRTF is in <br> very capable hands . " <br> " Got that right . " Wedge suddenly grinned . " Speaking of those capable <br> hands , pass along my regards to General Skywalker , will you ? " <br> " I will do that , Wedge . I will indeed . " <br> Continues ...
