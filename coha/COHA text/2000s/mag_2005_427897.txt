- Jan 6 , 2006 JOAN DIDION The Year of Magical Thinking 1 Nonfiction Books of the Year ( Knopf , $23.95 ) On Dec. 30 , 2003 , Joan Didion sat down to dinner with John Gregory Dunne , her husband of 40 years , and he had a fatal heart attack . Earlier in the day , they had visited the hospital where their daughter , Quintana , lay in a coma . Seeing Dunne slumped over , Didion writes , she initially thought he was " making a failed joke , an attempt to make the difficulty of the day seem manageable . I remember saying Do n't do that . " This is but the first of dozens of excruciating details Didion records in her shattering account of loss . Just when we thought every permutation of the memoir had been played out , from the rocky childhood or life-changing trauma , 2005 brought some blazingly original works like this masterpiece from Didion , perhaps the last writer anyone expected to step into the confessional fray . Famously restrained , Didion has never used her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . And she has never produced a more affecting book . She exquisitely portrays the irrationality of mourning , her grief heightened by the uncommon vitality of her relationship with Dunne . " I could not count the times during the average day when something would come up that I needed to tell him , " she writes . " This impulse did not end with his death . " The glimpses of the couple in happier days-their 1964 wedding , the first lunch with infant Quintana at an LA. bistro-make Didion 's elegy almost unbearably poignant . 2 The Orientalist Tom Reiss ( Random House , $25.95 ) Who was Kurban Said ? He 's known to have authored the popular ' ' 30s romance Ali and Nino , but beyond that fact little has been clear since Said was swallowed up in the madness of late- ' ' 30s Europe . Reiss shuffled through the man 's many aliases to piece together the strange , serpentine story of a dispossessed Jew named Lev Nussimbaum . The product of a politically complicated marriage ( father an oil baron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascism and panIslamism , an incorrigible imitator of Turkish style , and a would-be biographer of Mussolini : in other words , a real-life , Near Eastern Zelig . Not to mention the subject of a great read of a biography . 3 Suburban Safari Hannah Holmes ( Bloomsbury , $24.95 ) " The longer I look , the more I see , " Holmes writes in her fascinating , discursive , and joyous account of a year spent observing and researching all the living things-from a beloved chipmunk to a less appreciated nest of wasps-who share her suburban Maine backyard and bungalow . Who knew that nature writing , that notoriously humorless genre , could be this funny , irreverent , and inspiring ? 4 Tte -- Tte Hazel Rowley ( HarperCollins , $26.95 ) Short and pimply , existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre resembled a " malevolent goblin . " His longtime companion , feminist Simone de Beauvoir , wore her hair scraped up in a severe knot . But , as we learn in Rowley 's dandy bio , over their 50-year " open " relationship these dowdy intellectuals reveled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using a judicious mix of salacious detail and levelheaded analysis , Rowley captures the essence of one unorthodox couple 's vital , hypocritical , exploitative , and endlessly complicated affair . 5 Istanbul Orhan Pamuk ( Knopf , $26.95 ) Incorporating memoir , cultural history , literary criticism , and photographs , this marvelous and deeply personal book by Turkey 's preeminent novelist offers nuanced portraits of both an ancient city and the artist as a young man . Pamuk got himself in trouble earlier this year by talking candidly about his country 's history in a Swiss newspaper , specifically the slaughter of Armenians during World War I. And so , ironically , the author of this transcendent ode to Turkey 's greatest metropolis faces trial early next year for " insulting Turkishness. " 6 The Big Picture Edward Jay Epstein ( Random House , $25.95 ) The movie business used to be simple . Ask your granpappy about it . Studios released movies to theater chains they owned and kept all the profits . Epstein explains how that 's all changed in this exhaustively detailed tome , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both the layman and the expert alike , demonstrating along the way the difficulty of making art when movies are now but minuscule widgets in gargantuan corporate machines . 7 Fat Girl Judith Moore ( Hudson Street , $21.95 ) In this uncomfortably frank but unforgettable memoir , Moore distills a whole culture 's worth of so-called " body issues " into a powerful account of her lifelong hatred of her " bratwurst arms , " " clabber thighs , " and " pig eyes . " Moore announces early on that she has no intention of endearing herself to readers , and she 's not kidding . Using potently bitter language and imagery , she offers a tragic glimpse of profound physical self-loathing that many readers will squeamishly recognize , even if they do not fully share in it . 8 102 Minutes Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn ( Times , $15 ) By now , the globally televised events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , have been fractured into disparate images : planes , explosions , a tidal wave of cascading steel . Veteran Neiv York Times reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with memorable acts of heroism to assemble a definitive account of the day that is both heartbreaking and disconcertingly thrilling . With its single-minded focus on the people trapped in the Twin Towers , 102 Minutes is a profoundly humane book . 9 Blink Malcolm Gladwell ( Little , Brown , $25.95 ) In less time than it takes to read this sentence , we make some of our best decisions about everything from employees to lovers to military maneuvers , Gladwell argues in this lively , wide-ranging pop treatise . With the same intellectual versatility , contrarian sensibility , and breezy prose of his 2000 bestseller , The Tipping Point , Gladwell ingeniously weaves together egghead studies from wide-ranging fields to craft a compelling argument about the way we " think without thinking . " 10 Everybody Into the Pool Beth Lisick ( ReganBooks , $23.95 ) and Killing Yourself to Live Chuck Mosterman ( Scritmer , $23 ) What could possibly justify another memoir , a genre already glutted with overdramatic sob stories ? Probably the vibrant writing that characterizes these two titles . Lisick , raised in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submersion in the gritty , oversexed underground San Francisco scene . Meanwhile , Klosterman drives around to rock-star death sites and continues the great American tradition of the road trip as vehicle for self-discovery . Both understand that the quickest way to a reader 's heart is often through the funny bone . Unlikeliest Muse of the Year Convicted murderer Scott Peterson spawned a virtual cottage industry of bestselling nonfiction books , with everyone from Amber Frey to his sister contributing a title . Winningest Wizard Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold 6.9 million copies in its first 24 hours in stores , a record likely to be broken with J.K. Rowling 's next-and finalPotter installment . Best Book by a Confessed Functional Illiterate Life Is Not a Fairy Tale , by American Idol champ Fantasia Barrino , who signed multiple record deals and contracts she admits she could n't read . Fiction Books of The Year 1 On Beauty Zadie Smith ( Penguin , $25.95 ) It 's not the year 's tidiest novel , nor Is it the most smoothly plotted . Zadie Smith 's On Beauty sprawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tosses around a couple of egregiously underlmaglned characters . Nonetheless , this engrossing homage to E.M . Forster 's Howards End Is the most generous , emotionally engaging , richly peopled , and expansive novel to appear this year-a glorious , overstuffed , oldfashioned page-turner . Like Forster , Smith sets out to explore the philosophical division between two families , the staunchly conservative Kippses and the liberal Betseys . But while this novel Is driven by Ideas , Smith 's Insight into her characters brings It to full , radiant life . Who can forget KIkI Belsey , the book 's earthy matriarch , bargaining with a Haitian street peddler In a passage that illuminates every nuancesuperficial , sexual , sociopolitical , racial-of that everyday interaction ? Who wo n't pity tired , embittered Howard Belsey as he makes a dismal hash of his loving marriage ? The product of the author 's crazy and wonderful attempt to get her arms around the issues of race , politics , class , the Old World versus the New , matrimony , aging , death , and rap music , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluptuous pleasure to read . 2 Never Let Me Go Kazuo Ishiguro ( Knopf , $24 ) The dread creeps up on you gradually as you slip into the superficially serene world of Ishiguro 's wintry novel . Something is off-but what exactly ? Who is our strangely calm narrator , this 31-year-old Kathy H. ? What does her mysterious job as a " carer " entail exactly ? What is the subtext to her happy memories of that bizarre boarding school ? To answer any of these questions would spoil the shivery pleasure of experiencing this extraordinary and eerie book for yourself . 3 13 Steps Down Ruth Rendell ( Crmvn , $25 ) Over the years , Baroness Rendell has written dozens of superb detective stories in the classic English tradition , but with this engrossing thriller , a black comedy about an inept , narcissistic killer and his misanthropic landlady , she steps outside the familiar cozy framework . The result : one of her most striking works to date , an ironic and very funny novel about solipsism and contemporary loneliness . 4 The March E.L . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman 's march through Georgia and into the Carolinas was both omnivorous in its scope and ghastly in its execution . Doctorow presents the Union Army 's maneuver as a society unto itself-multileveled , self-perpetuating , and ultimately destructive . The latest entry in the author 's unofficial chronicle of American history , The March is superb in its Ragtime-esque blend of fictional and historical figures , and brutally perceptive in its insistence that this nation is continually reborn from tragedy . 5 Cold Skin Albert Snchez Piol ( FSG , $20 ) Shortly after World War I , a weather official is deposited on a small island near Antarctica where he is to stay for the year . Twenty-three pages into Snchez Piol 's philosophical horror novel , the monsters attack . Cold Skin starts off eerily , gets scary , and then remains that way , alternating between the two moods in a sine wave of tension and release that christens the author as a Catalonian H.P. Lovecraft. 6 Beasts of No Nation Uzodinma Iweala ( HarperCollins , $16.95 ) You can read news articles about warfare in faraway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's impossible to nod off when you observe an African nation in the throes of violent civil war from the point of view of Iweala 's narrator , a precocious schoolboy-turned-soldier . In his remarkable debut novella , Iweala captures the horror of ethnic violence in all its brutality and the vulnerability of youth in all its innocence . 7 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince U.K. Rowling ( Scholastic , $29.99 ) Rare is the series that remains so imaginative , so consistent , and so beguiling this late in its cycle . With the penultimate volume in her planned seven-book saga about a heroic teen wizard , Rowling restores narrative discipline and ties up some loose threads in preparation for her eagerly awaited ( and , alas , still unscheduled ) grand finale . The horcrux of the matter : Rowling is still at the tippy-toes top of her game . 8 Dancing in the Dark Caryl Phillips ( Knopf , $23.95 ) " The funniest man I ever saw , and the saddest man I ever knew . " That 's how W.C. Fields once described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of the last century for his bumbling blackface routine . In a lyrical , melancholy dream of a novel based on the real-life Williams , Phillips explores the tragedy of an innately dignified man who , for manifold reasons both personal and societal , systematically stripped himself of that dignity . 9 Ex Machina Brian K. Vaughan ( WildStorm , $2.99 each ) and Black Hole Charles Burns ( Pantheon , $24.95 ) The two best comics of the year strike very different chords . Ex Machina , an ongoing serial about a former superhero who 's elected mayor of post-9/11 New York City , is a provocative rumination on do-gooder idealism in a cynical culture . Writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Tony Harris convert complicated reality into compelling entertainment with fiery thoughtfulness . Meanwhile , Black Hole peers inward instead of outward . A tone-perfect evocation of teenage alienation , Burns ' graphic novel tracks the downward spiral of dope-hazed , hormonally juiced high school wastrels afflicted with repulsive/ attractive freak-show abnormalities-a creepy conceit for the all-consuming melodrama of adolescence . 10 Drive James SaIMs ( Poisoned Pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients of the classic Los Angeles crime novel-an inscrutable hard-boiled antihero , a heist gone wrong , some really nasty dudes-and shakes them up into a lethal new cocktail . This slender , beautifully written noir thriller goes down real smooth , real quick , and when it 's done you 'll want another . Smith 's book is a thing of Beauty The Worst 1 Eldest Christopher Paolini ( Knopf , $21 ) The loyal pet dragon breathes fire , the ageless elves speak wisdom , the doughty adolescent hero prepares to do battle with the forces of cruel emperor Galbatorix , and readers past the age of 12 want to hurl this purple , 700page Tolkien wannabe into the Ramr River . 2 Fan-Tan Marion Brando and Donald Cammell ( Knopf , $23.95 ) When the late Marion Brando and his Hollywood pal Donald Cammell dreamed up this crummy , lurid , pulp-fiction fantasy about adventure and anal sex on the South Seas two decades ago , they had fun , and then they lost interest and set the manuscript aside , incomplete . Their instincts were good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Knapf , $25.95 ) What 's more shocking : that the bestselling author of steamy , homoerotic vampire sagas wanted to write a first-person novel about Jesus ' early life ? Or that the resulting volume is so earnest , pallid , and dull ? 4 Everyone Worth Knowing Lauren Weisberger ( Simow &; Schuster , $23.95 ) With The Devil Wears Prada , at least Weisberger had the Vogue insider thing and one clever title working for her . But this follow-up is like a cheap Prada knockoff-all the vapidness and weak plotting , none of the dishiness. 5 A Lotus Grows in the Mud Goldie Hawn ( Putnam , $25.95 ) A shallow , flower-power pile of mulch . - By Jennifer Reese , with Jennifer Armstrong , Scott Brown , Gilbert Cruz , Thorn Geier , Jeff Jensen , and Lisa Schwarzbaum Paolini : alone in his field Book Title Containing a Word We Had to Dash Out Last Year Ex-Princeton prof Harpy G. Frankfurt 's On Bullshit Best Blog-to-Book Translation Julie Powell 's Julie &; Julia : 365 Days , 524 Recipes , 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Washingtonienne Most Inexplicable Book Trend The crushing number of books devoted to Sudoku , the most addictive game since the Rubik 's Cube . Luckiest Bastard ( Oprah edition ) A certain TV host picks James Prey 's A Million Little Pieces for her revived book club and it hits No. 1 on the New York Times ' paperback nonfiction list for 12 weeks ( and counting ) . Luckiest Bastard ( RIP edition ) Despite being dead for two decades , Truman Capote enjoyed a comeback : Random House published his recently rediscovered novel Summer Crossing . And the critically acclaimed biopic Capote appeared , boosting sales of his classic In Cold Blood .
