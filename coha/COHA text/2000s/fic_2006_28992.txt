10 January 1899 Dear Mr. Wood , I write to you having received your name and address from my husband , John Smith , who has been doing some research at the prison where you currently reside for a novel he is completing . I have never corresponded with a prisoner before . I do not know if , or why , you might have committed the criminal act for which you are serving time . My husband says he believes many of the criminals at Hollow gate to be innocent victims of injustice . I , having never been in any prison , have no way of knowing the truth behind his assertions . I do know , were I in prison and deprived of the companionship of family and friends , I should find it a consolation to have another person with whom to share the occasional thought . I hope I can be that person for you . Wishing you well , Mrs. John Smith One week later , I had my first reply . Though the writing was crude , the paper it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together rin an educated enough fashion : Dear Mrs. John Smith , I do not know why you have taken it upon yourself to do this , but I do sowish you would stop . Chance Wood Chapter Two 31 December 1898 " Mr. and Mrs.John Smith , " announced the Collinses ' butler as we made our way into their crowded salon at the top of the cascade of stairs , the house yet festooned with the remnants of Christmas , the scents of pine , myrtle , oranges , cinnamon , and cloves in the air , the applewood burning in the fireplace as if the season might never end . We were twenty-four at dinner . Beneath one of three chandeliers adorned with glass globes and crystal prisms , I sat near the head of the table , the legs of which were carved to look like a bear 's claws , on one of the leather-upholstered chairs in the long scarlet dining room . To the right of me was Joshua Collins , the head of the household . Captain Brimley , portly as ever , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an overly feminine man , but he was a delightful conversationalist , frequently called into service as escort to Lady Collins , Joshua 's widowed mother . Lady Collins herself , still a sparkling woman at nearly seventy , had adorned her perpetual mourner 's black clothes with jet bead for the occasion and was seated to one side of John at the other end of the table , opposite to me ; on John 's other side was Joshua 's wife , Maeve , a lilac gown softening a natural severity of feature brought about by bearing far too many children . " Tell me , " said the captain , mustache bristling mischievously , " what is your good husband working on now ? " Taking advantage of a lull in the talk as diners bent heads to the soup a la reine , I half shouted down the table , repeating the captain 's question . John set his sterling soup spoon down carefully , planted elbows firmly on the table , rubbed one palm against the other . " Well , Captain , " he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table hard upon my half shout , " I can tell you that if you want to know about my next novel , " he paused dramatically , the candelabra before him reflecting as a pleased glint in his eye , " all questions you have will surely be revealed when you purchase a copy upon its publication sometime next year . " The table roared at the captain 's expense . All assembled were familiar with John 's reluctance to discuss works in progress . The men all rested on family fortunes large enough they need n't work , so in essence John was the only one with a career to speak of . Well , except for Captain Brimley . " You 're a heartless man , John , " spoke the captain , mockingly clutching athis chest as though wounded . " I can tell you this , " said John . " It has to do with a prison . " " Which prison ? " pressed the captain . But John had already taken up spoon again , turning his attention away . Not long afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins 's feet , garnet skirts spread about me , knees tucked under chin . The floor beneath me was solid wood , in keeping with the current practice of using as little carpeting as possible for sanitary reasons ; Joshua Collins was nothing if not modern . Listening to the fading murmur of men 's voices in the dining room on the other side of the draped portiere , where the men lingered over port and cigars , I recalled being at home earlier in the evening , preparing to go out . " You look beautiful this evening , Emma , " John had said . John 's words came as he stood behind me , while I was seated before the vanity . I suppose I might have taken his words as being the rote delivery of a well-versed husband , were it not that he had spoken similar words , along with declarations of love , every day of our married life . " I am indeed a lucky man . " I turned my brown eyes upward to meet his blue ones in the mirror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , his fair hair and fine features-aquiline nose , affectionate lips , sturdy enough jaw-a full head and a half taller than I. Behind us in the mirror , I could see the woven coverlet , dust ruffles , and pillow shams of our large four-poster bed , made of solid rosewood , intricately carved , the aubergine sheets rumpled from a fortifying nap . " Why do you say that ? " I asked , twinkling . After sixteen years of marriage , I knew a number of the reasons he might respond with , but it was still a source of amusement . Would he tell me I was more intelligent than other women ? Admire my ankles ? Praise the job I was doing raising our six-year-old son , Weston ? He held my gaze as he bent down so his reflection was even with my own , his fair features side by side with the dark ringlets I was fashioning into an elaborate design upon my head even as we spoke . I was aware the darkness of my hair created a strong picture combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it was not John 's favorite color on me but it was a color I loved nonetheless . The ringlets framed pale skin , my cheekbones still high and firm despite my thirty-four years . In fact , the only part of me that showed my age was a less than girlish fullness to my figure , a fullness John claimed to adore . " Because you are not in the slightest like the other ladies , " he replied . Then he delicately traced the outline of my mouth with one long finger , and kissed me . It was the kind of kiss any woman who has been married for sixteen years can identify ; it said , " I love you , I even still want you , but we are already going to be late for the party , and I have no intention of getting dressed a second time . " Now , seated at Lady Collins 's feet , I heard in my mind 's ear the words of John playing the " You know what I love about you , Emma ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would say of my solitary and unladylike position on the floor , as all around me the ladies sat properly , opened fans and preened , " It is that you refuse to put on airs . " " You know what I dislike most about my husband ? " asked Sara Jamison , adjusting her seasonally jade skirts on the sofa . The abundance of jade needed to cover her overfull figure did nothing for the perpetual florid condition of her moon face , framed as it was by yellow hair . Sara was frequently the one to set flame to what I thought of as these exercises in futility and , as was also customary , she did not wait for an answer to her rhetorical question before supplying one herself . " It is that he is possessed of the belief that only I am capable of straightening his handkerchief . Certainly not his valet . Never himself . " It took so little , really . " Well , I always say , " said Hettie Larwood , who always said much and , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should eat more , " George would not even know which fork to use if I did not repeatedly remind him . " Constance Biltmore said Charles was a poor sport at cards . If they were going to dislike something most in their husbands , could they not at least find something more substantial to pick at ? And , yet , everyone played , save Maeve , whose husband had just provided an ample meal for all ; and Lady Collins , a widow , although I had long suspected when Lord Collins was alive she never skewered him . " What about you , Emma ? " Hettie asked with some degree of asperity . " You never say . " But I just shook my head and smiled shyly , hoping all the while they would read my reluctance to speak out against my husband not as a defiant act of cool superiority but as testimony that John perhaps had so many fatal flaws , I did n't know where to begin ! Why was I even interested in perpetuating such a deception , particularly when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because , despite my personal inclination , these women-more properly , the men these women were married to-mattered to John 's world , mattered a great deal . If , occasionally , I had to be a slightly fictitious woman to help my husband out , what matter that ? I looked at the others , on tte -- ttes and sofas , their dressed heads close in gossip . In their own way they resembled the putti : the cherubs and cupids cavorting on the curved backs and arms of Joshua 's furniture . The only one I felt a real fondness for was Constance . Timid , even among those who had known her long and presumably well , I recognized the cost to her of publicly criticizing her husband . Of the wives ' complaints , hers had been the only one of substance . As I watched her trying to keep up with the gossip of the others , and failing miserably , her guileless blue eyes wide under blond feather brows a shade darker than her white-gold hair , it occurred to me that of all the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know her better . " You 're not like any of the others , are you ? " Lady Collins 's words to me were more a conspiratorial observation than a query . I had always liked Lady Collins . John was the first of the men to enter . Immediately , before I could move my skirts to make a place for him , he lowered his lanky form to the floor , leaning back on one elbow as he stretched out beside me . " Know what I love about you , Emma ? " He whispered the words , not waiting for my answer . " It is that you refuse to put on airs . " I smiled back at him , the warm glow of the gas fireplace almost like another presence , uniting us in a way that made me feel as though we were momentarily alone . But I said nothing , a brief coldness stealing into me as I reflected how , just occasionally , I felt as though he were an air I had put on-something that suited me best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins entered , consulting his pocket watch , as though he did not know exactly what time it was right down to the minute . " The New Year hour draws near , " he announced . He struck a pose , elbow casually resting near the marble mantel clock on the fireplace , as the butler distributed champagne glasses . " There is much that has passed in to the history books in the last year . Gladstone has died , Bismarck- " " Not to mention Lewis Carroll , Stephan Mallarm , and Theodor Fontane , " interjected John . " Yes , John , " Joshua acknowledged indulgently , " you writers have had a very busy year . . . in terms of dying . Still , in less than an hour , we will be entering the last year of the century . Shall we play the resolution game ? " No one objected . Joshua was known for his propensity for seeking out the appropriate game for any occasion , and what better one that night ? " I will go first , " Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused long enough to make it appear he had just formulated his resolution on the spot . He raised his glass . " I resolve to host an even better New Year 's party next year . " " Hear , hear ! " The assembled all toasted his resolve in return . " Darling ? " He turned to Maeve on his right . " And I resolve to do everything in my power to help , " she said . More " hear , hears " all around . Next week , I was certain , when we dined at the Larwoods ' , Maeve would be back to telling us her usual complaint of how infuriating it was when Joshua trimmed his nose hairs within her sight . If she were really daring , she might say she sincerely hoped he never visited any more children upon her-she already had more than her friends could reliably count-but I doubted such honesty would ever be forthcoming . Paul Jamison resolved to learn how to position his own handkerchief . George Larwood added his desire to master the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hettie would ever let him eat much . Charles Biltmore could not , in all honesty , resolve to be a better sport in the New Year , and so , he resolved to forsake cards altogether . Not that any of us could picture Charles , such a natural at a baize gaming table or at York racing week , his brown hair never cut quite enough , his collar never exactly straight , ever walking away from his passion . Still , I almost laughed . Had they somehow heard us even through the din of their own loud chatter as they lingered over their port ? Or did they know the hearts and minds of those they were married to , in spite of what their wives might think ? But to a man , their faces gave away nothing . Lady Collins declined to make any resolution , concluding , " I am quite sure my words would only come back to haunt me in the following year . " People " hear , heared " her right to dissent , although some looked put out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , John did not hesitate . " I would like to finish the novel I am working on to my satisfaction and I would like to make my wife the happiest woman in the world . " " Unfair , " chuckled Joshua Collins . " The rest of us had to content ourselves with one resolution . You can not now claim for yourself two . You must choose . " " Very well , then . " Again John did not hesitate , looking straight into my eyes . " I choose Emma . I will always choose Emma . " At last , it was my turn . Watching the others , it had seemed easy . Now it came to it , however , it felt somehow as though there really would be some profound import attached to my selection , as opposed to the relative unimportance in the greater scheme of things behind Sara Jamison 's firmly stated resolve to consume fewer fairy cakes in the coming year . The room awaited my resolution , some with more patience than others . I thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , but up until this point , I had only thought of my life in a very unthinking sort of way . I knew I was adept at the many roles I was called upon to play . I was a good enough daughter ; at least my father thought so . I was good at parties , even if I could not be depended upon to be drawn into every game the other women seemed intent on playing . I would even go so far as to say I liked our social world ; for , after all , is there not great human satisfaction to be found in doing a thing well ? Inbeing able to retain one 's own sense of individuality when in a group and yet somehow manage not to give any serious offense ? Still , outside of being the best mother I could be to Weston , what had I really achieved , save the attachment of myself to John 's star ? I had always been preoccupied with being good . It was my strength . It was my weakness . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to be a better person . " I spoke the words more fiercely than I had intended . It was almost the New Year . John met my gaze steadily , with an approvingly prideful one of his own . " Then you shall be , " he said , as if it were as simple as that . Continues ...
