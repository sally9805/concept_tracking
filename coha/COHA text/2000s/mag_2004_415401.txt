A singular , sensational town house lures the less to the Upper East Side . BY ANNE MIDGETTE // Tonya Lewis Lee did n't want to live in Brooklyn . This was tantamount to heresy.Tonya , after all , is married to Spike Lee , the director of such films as She 's Got ta Have It , Malcolm X and , most recently , She Hate Me . Spike is well known as a black activist , a provocateur-and a Brooklynite . Tonya did n't have anything against Brooklyn , but it was hard to live there as Spike 's wife , in Spike 's very well-known brownstone , in a community that thought of Spike as its own property . She had nothing against being well known , either ; but she drew the line when strangers started ringing her doorbell at four in the morning . " Kids would stand in the street and yell up , ' Yo , Spike ! ' " Tonya recalls . " ! would look out the window and they would say , ' Are youT-Boz ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aura of a star : a model 's willowy build , an easygoing , natural warmth in her dealings with the , world . But rather than being a performer , she 's a lawyer , television producer , writer and hands-on mother of two children ( son Jackson is seven ; daughter Satchel , nine ) . And although she leads a high-profile life , she wanted a slightly less public arena for it . " We needed to create our own family existence , " she says . In Manhattan . Easier said than done in the city 's competitive real-estate market . When they started their search , in the mid-1990s , trendy neighborhoods like SoHo and TriBeCa seemed overpriced . After a year and a half of looking downtown , she decided to broaden the field . " My mother and father kept telling me to consider the Upper East Side , " she says . " I thought , ' Why would I want to live on the Upper East Side ? " ' The answer begins on a sunny , tree-lined street , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incongruous among brownstones and apartment buildings , shimmers behind an iron gate . Inside , a looking-glass world seems far larger than even the broad facade indicates : 9,500 square feet , with one big , comfortable room after another . Just across the threshold , an original hardwood floor , freed from the surfaces that covered it for years , gleams richly . In the living room , marble herms with the oval faces and full lips of Art Nouveau beauties support a fireplace mantel . And French windows open onto a private courtyard flooded with its own welling spring of sunlight . Even for a die-hard Brooklynite , it was an easy sell . " I loved the house , " says Tonya , " but Spike really loved it . He said , Oh , we 're living here . What 's our offer ? Let 's make it right here , right now . ' " Tonya , whose father was a highranking executive at Philip Morris , adds , " I come from a very conservative family , so I said , ' You never do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't listen to me . " The house 's distinctive , spacious layout had attracted other artistic types before the Lees . Built between 1917 and 1919 for aVanderbilt scion but rejected by her for being unfashionably far east , the house was empty when it was discovered in the 1940s by another Lee-the stripper and entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee . A later owner , the painter Jasper Johns , sold it to Tonya and Spike in 1998 . They may have been inspired by the energies of past residents , but the Lees took the house in hand , both restoring it-uncovering a wealth of original detail in the process-and giving it their own stamp . Working with architect Max Bond , they moved walls , turned Johns 's studio into their dining room , relocated the kitchen from upstairs to a more central area on the ground floor and lived in the front wing of the house ( now Spike 's and Tonya 's offices ) while the back was being converted into bedrooms . Bond helped select a palette of cool , calming dove- and blue-grays for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingles comfortably with basketball memorabilia . The subdued but strong wall colors are also a perfect backdrop for the Lees ' extensive collection of art by African Americans . Two bright Romare Bearden watercolors grace the master bedroom ; Gordon Parks photographs line a hallway ; and in the living room , the family photos that cover one wall face prints and lithographs by Charles Wilbert White , Charles Alston , Elizabeth Catlett-and Satchel Lee . " People say , Oh , that 's such great folk art , ' " says the artist 's mother , amused . Juxtaposing great art and family souvenirs , infusing an imposing and beautiful space with a sense of comfort and a cozy mess of children 's toys : the combinations Tonya has created in decorating her home are reflected in the wide variety of roles she plays in her daily life . As a professional , she produces shows like the documentary / Sit Where I Want , an exploration of racial integration in a New York State high school that aired on cable television last May , on the fiftieth anniversary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sits on the board of such organizations as the Legal Defense Fund of the NAACP . As a mother who chooses not to have live-in help , she maintains homes in New York and Martha 's Vineyard , and she takes an active role in the education of her children , who attend one of the most competitive private schools in the city . Tonya 's own memories of the racial prejudice she encountered while attending public schools in suburban Milwaukee and St. Louis contrasted with her more positive private-school experience , so she felt strongly that private schools were a better option for her own children . But it was another big leap for Spike , a committed supporter of public education . " ! would say to him , ' Please be nice . Smile , ' " Tonya says , describing their preparations for the grueling admissions process . " We need them to get in somewhere before you can say you reject it . " Tonya 's lifestyle , real-estate search and neighborhood have played into her most recent project , the novel Gotham Diaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coauthored with her close friend Crystal McCrary Anthony . Tonya and Crystal insist that the novel , published by Hyperion in July , is not a roman clef , but , Tonya concedes , " You write what you know . " The book itself had a glamorous beginning : the friends hatched the idea in Cannes , where Tonya had invited Crystal to keep her company while Spike conducted business at the film festival . ( Crystal , who is separated from former basketball player and ESPN commentator Greg Anthony , had already coauthored one novel : Homecourt Advantage , a story about NBA wives and girlfriends . ) Working on Gotham Diaries was facilitated by the fact that Crystal lives two blocks away fromTonya , in an apartment sold to her by Spencer Means , a prominent New York realestate agent upon whom one of the main characters in Gotham Diaries is based . " It 's like two degrees of separation , " Crystal says of Manhattan 's community of affluent African Americans . For many readers , the book is a first glimpse of that tight-knit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to show . This is one reason Tonya injects a dose of diversity into her projects , be it her next television program - Miracle 's Boys , based on Jacqueline Woodson 's teen novel about three brothers in Harlem-or the children 's picture book Please , Baby , Please , which she and Spike cowrote in part because they could n't find enough stories about African Americans to read to their own children . Other future projects include a second novel with Crystal ( focusing on an African American media family ) and another children 's book , this one about a child with a dog-the prospect of which excites Jackson , since his mother 's commitment to writing about what she knows might very well necessitate the acquisition of a puppy . " I told my editor , ' You are really backing me into a corner here , ' " Tonya says with a laugh . But there are plenty of corners to back into in the house - including a few in which Jackson claims to have spotted the specter of Gypsy Rose Lee herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spike says .
