It is a fact of life for persons living in the most impoverished urban settings that mental health services are few and far between , and when available , only weakly implemented or partially received . This is because ordinary life in these communities is challenged by comparatively higher levels of uncertainty and chaos for adults , youth , children , and families . Similarly challenged are their friends , neighbors , educators , and caregivers . High population density ; low income ; sizeable distances and inability to travel ; fear of crime ; substance abuse ; changes in housing patterns , program funding , and local politics ; discrimination ; high rates of turnover in program staff and administrators ( mental health and public school ) ; and school closings in impoverished urban community settings are only a few of the challenges to the very notion of the provision of mental health services that are effective , accessible , and sustainable . Further , these circumstances pose significant challenges to conducting research on alternative mental health practices of sufficient quality and rigor necessary to pass standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Graczyk , Frazier , and Abdul-Adil ( 2003 ) describe a series of interrelated studies seeking to provide school-based mental health services in urban settings that were affected by and shaped to address these challenges . Lessons they learned break new ground by addressing four prototypical " urban " challenges : ( a ) limited access to children and families in need of services , ( b ) limited effectiveness of current practice to impact children 's academic and behavioral outcomes , ( c ) difficulty engaging indigenous community resources to foster sustainability of services , and ( d ) interagency collaborations to better focus scarce resources to achieve greater impact . <p> In this work , one sees an effort to conduct research on evidenced-based practices in ways that sustain and support continued use over time and that maintain collaboration ( e.g. , Burns &; Hoagwood , 2002 ) . The larger scientific issue addressed in this work is the question of exactly how educational and mental health scientists should go about creating conditions in impoverished communities necessary to the conduct of experiments designed to improve practice , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions for the conduct of experimental studies , I believe , should be viewed as what is commonly known among scientists as " building the laboratory . " <p> Laboratories , of course , are the unique environments that scientists use to conduct experiments , wherein experimental science is recognized to be the best way to discover " cause and effect " relationships ( Shadish , Cook , &; Campbell , 2002 ) . Community-based laboratories , like those used in " bench sciences " are places were participants are willing to participate and the problem conditions of interest to the scientist may be found in abundance . Unique to educational and mental health intervention research , community-based laboratories are places where people actually live , go to school , work , and recreate ; and wherein , they have a personal interest in what " goes down " in the community and for what reasons . <p> The Juniper Gardens Children 's Project ( JGCP ) in Kansas City , KS is a long-standing community-based laboratory where behavioral , educational , and mental health related research has been successfully conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hoyt , &; Greenwood , 1989 ) . The JGCP serves the northeast community in Kansas City , KS , a community where the problems ( the risk factors ) operating in urban communities are abundant . Some of the reasons for its longevity and success are those mentioned by Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) . JGCP qualifies as a laboratory not only because it is a place that has the problem conditions of interest , but because of its mission , design , and record of collaboration with university researchers . It is a place that is welcoming to research that attempts to test the effects of solutions to problems in educational and mental health practice . It is a place where community leaders have become knowledgeable about research , participate in targeting local issues in need of research , and differentiate between important versus frivolous research projects . It is a place where leaders are committed to reaping the benefit of research on practice as a means of receiving better services and outcomes , and to being a partner in the research enterprise as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratories like the JGCP can be seen as a response to the daunting challenges faced by researchers working in impoverished communities of the type described by Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) . Creating a partnership between university faculty and the community that became the JGCP was not easy and it took time and effort . Problem : Limited Access to Children and Families in Need <p> A simple fact of research on practice is that clients must want mental health services and show up to engage them , and too many routine challenges in urban life inhibit both . Experimental research studies fail in the absence of participation or with systematic attrition in one or more treatment conditions ( the clinic delivery option ) , as described by Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) . Delivery of mental health services and research on these practices requires systematic access to clients , and in impoverished urban communities , schools are places where most children actually show up frequently enough to receive mental health services . Like education , mental health services unfold over time and are rarely one shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , schools present a strategic site for research and service with much greater probability of access as compared to community-based clinics , for example . Neighborhoods are also strategic sites for research and services , although less easy to define and identify as places than school buildings . <p> Studies conducted in community-based laboratories have a much greater chance of implementation and rigor because preconditions that affect participation and engagement of residents with research are in place . Some of these conditions were employed by Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) . For example , a facet of their community model in Study 1 involved working with and through local community persons , as compared to a direct service clinic model . Similarly in Study 2 , they identified and worked through master-teacher , building leaders in order to advance changes in practice among the general teacher population in participating schools . Both of these strategies have been long practiced at JGCP and have been extended to a cultural process of working through community residents whenever possible . A challenge to anyone seeking to promote change in communities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term , not an overnighter . It is easy for researchers to remain outsiders in this context . <p> At the JGCP , university researchers located facilities in the community and worked to become partners with community residents ( Hall et al. , 1989 ) . Initial overtures to work in the community failed for all the reasons previously mentioned . It was not until after many individual and group communications had been completed with various leaders in the churches , in the community center , in town meetings , in the housing project , and with key leaders that the idea was accepted and faculty were invited to locate a center in the community . Members of these communities are rightfully skeptical because of discrimination and the terrible reputation of research and of scientists working in racially and linguistically diverse communities in this country . No one wants to be a " guinea pig " and no urban community wants to help scientists achieve success without an equitable share in the action . <p> In fact , the founding of the JGCP may have never happened at all if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might actually benefit their children and were able to sway others ( R. L. Schiefelbusch , personal communication , May 5 , 2003 ) . Based on input from the community , the mission of the JGCP eventually became one of conducting research " to improve the children 's developmental experiences and their social and academic achievements " ( p. 301 ) , a mission dedicated to learning new knowledge by " testing solutions " and not by " studying the community " ( Hall et al. , 1989 ) . Also framed in the mission and true today was the commitment to locate the research and the research staff in the community , which initially led to after-school tutoring programs in area churches , and preschool programs in the housing project 's community center . These programs eventually moved into the public schools and today are collaborations with the schools and programs like Early Head Start and Head Start . Problem : Limited , Effectiveness of Practice to Impact Children 's Academic and Behavioral Outcomes <p> Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) noted that clinic-based practices often do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also indicated that too few experimental studies of practices have been successfully conducted in " real " community settings with local staff and community residents as " implementers . " And , too few have been shown to produce measurably superior results . In the community laboratory ( e.g. , JGCP ) , it was shown that parents and teachers under conditions of training and motivation could produce meaningful improvements in children 's academic and behavioral outcomes ( Greenwood et al. , 1992 ) . Benefiting were the children whose performance was improved , and parents and teachers , who learned better ways of guiding their interactions with children to produce therapeutic effects . Translation of therapeutic practices to work in the community laboratory involves creating the knowledge , training , motivation , and experiences necessary for local residents to improve what they do based on research findings in forms that are usable by them . <p> Early researchers at JGCP quickly learned that they needed reliable and valid measures of child outcomes and of implementation of practices in order to gauge the success and failure of alternative practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what children , parents , and teachers actually did become critically important to the design and evaluation of subsequent experimental studies that took place in community and school settings . <p> These and other behavioral and curriculum-based measures were linked to a program of studies sometimes involving descriptive-correlation , single-subject , and experimental-control group designs in order to achieve sufficient knowledge of the problem conditions and their relationship to child outcomes ( **25;2875;TOOLONG ) , initial tests of intervention strategies and validation of promising techniques ( single-subject ) , and large-scale tests of efficacy ( experimental-control group ) . The results across multiple studies were intervention methods such as incidental teaching ( Hart &; Risley , 1978 ) , class-wide peer tutoring ( Greenwood , Delquadri , &; Hall , 1989 ) , and a range of strategies for promoting the skills of children with autism and behavior problems ( Kamps , Kravits , &; Ross , 2002 ; Kamps , Kravits , Stolze , &; Swaggart , 1999 ) among many others , where improvements in children 's outcomes were convincingly demonstrated using rigorous measures and " causal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intervention was learned , delivered , and maintained at levels high enough to document that intervention was present , and thus , causal . Problem : Engaging Indigenous Community Resources to Foster Sustainability of Services <p> Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) described procedures for obtaining local buy in and use of indigenous resources in order to establish and maintain participation in research efforts . These are really steps on a path towards creating a community laboratory . A community laboratory is a place where efforts like these have built up trust , understanding , and a shared vision of the benefits that can be achieved through research participation . The JGCP is one such community laboratory with nearly 40 years experience . Maintaining community laboratories like the JGCP , one year at a time over many years , has enabled multiple , systematic lines of research to be proposed and undertaken in a continuous effort benefiting both the community and its research partners . <p> The challenges of working in impoverished communities notwithstanding , it is surprising to casual observers that , in fact , many personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory and its work . All communities have a history , and multiple-generation families living there carry this history and its cultural experiences . For example , the northeast community in Kansas City , KS , is a place where the Lewis and Clark Expedition spent several nights camped where the Kansas River joins the Missouri , where slaves made an important stop on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War , where a center of African American intellectual and business excellence in the 1930s emerged , and where a hot-bed of civil rights action in the 1960s was launched . From this community have come astronauts , Olympic and professional athletes , authors , doctors , lawyers , and business persons , etc. , all who personally overcame impoverished conditions . The lesson is that there are many in these communities who can serve on advisory boards , who will work as employees or volunteers , who can speak in support of the work and its benefit , and who are willing to go to bat for the project in times of trouble , and these assets often are overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for researchers seeking to establish or maintain community-based laboratories is how to engage community members in the overall mission and in the conduct of specific studies , knowing that their participation is critical to achieving implementation . The experiences of Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) , the JGCP , and others show that this support has to be " earned " by concentrated and sustained efforts . Researchers must be willing to invest the time and effort needed to show communities that their intentions are worthy of support and that what they propose to do and how they propose to do it , and the anticipated results , also are worthy of support ( Abbott , Walton , Tapia , &; Greenwood , 1999 ) . Establishing a community-based laboratory is nothing like most university research where a graduate student is permitted to complete a project in a school and then leaves with the results without providing any " value added " to the work ongoing at the school . Community laboratories must deal in the promise of " value added " and produce benefit over time . Results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its existence . Problem : Interagency/Organization Collaborations to Better Use Resources to Achieve Greater Impact <p> Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) in Study 3 , illustrate the pooling of agency 's funds to support delivery of a shared practice ( e.g. , school-wide Positive Behavior Support ) and to coordinate their services to achieve a larger and better effort than could be realized by each agency working alone . This is a lesson for which the time has clearly arrived . In many states and nationally , mandates are in place or planned that require agency coordination , for example , between state Social Rehabilitation Services ( SRS ) and mental health services . In other cases , agencies have chosen to collocate and integrate services and information systems in ways designed to improve access and delivery of services , share costs , and improve the quality of service . How these reforms will work remains to be seen . <p> A lesson of the JGCP is that the community-based laboratory has significant potential for attracting research , training , and service funding . This laboratory is a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only works on solutions to problems of importance to community residents , but that rents space from local landlords , employs and trains , and advances in employment community persons . The JGCP is an intellectual and economic partner to other agencies in the community ( e.g. , schools , Head Start ) as well as academic departments in the University , who collaborate in their grant writing to obtain funding because of its ability to provide research , design , and measurement capabilities of interest to these organizations . Summary/Conclusion <p> Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) , describe progress towards a model for promoting urban children 's mental health . The problems they courageously report and steps taken to test new ideas with potential for overcoming these problems is an excellent demonstration of how knowledge is accumulated based on trial and learning from success or failure . Particularly evident in their report is how fragile randomized research designs are in the urban community in the face of serious attrition due to simple lack of interest that can cause an entire study to fail . <p> Community-based laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by scientists seeking to complete research to understand problem conditions , to undertake experimental studies  --  sometimes over many years duration , and to learn how to work collaboratively with community residents . Clearly , the community laboratory concept has implications for serious work undertaken within communities and Atkins et al . ( 2003 ) are well on their way towards creating their own community laboratory . <p> Copyright 2003 by the National Association of School Psychologists , ISSN 0279-6015 <p>
