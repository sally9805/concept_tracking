<p> Off to the best start of his magnificent Hall of Fame-bound <p> career , Roger Clemens arrived at Coors Field and suddenly realized he was n't pitching unless he was pitching from the stretch . <p> Rarely during that April start in Denver did Clemens throw a pitch for the Houston Astros without the distraction of a Rockies player leading off base . He worked deliberately and indecisively , seemingly troubled about whether he should throw his split-finger pitch that could n't be trusted to break , or his fastball that for some reason was n't soaring beyond 92 mph . <p> From high atop Coors Field , in the executive suite of his boss , general manager Dan O'Dowd , Rockies director of baseball administration Thad Levine not only watched Clemens try to perform without his ' out ' pitch , but observed the struggles four days later of World Series hero Josh Beckett . <p> So strong is Beckett , he shut out the New York Yankees on three days ' rest at Yankee Stadium in the decisive Game 6 of the 2003 World Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late-April at Coors . <p> Like Clemens and many other aces who passed through , Beckett managed to beat the Rockies , but not without enduring an unusual period of duress . <p> Watching the likes of Clemens and Beckett sweat through their one and only starts in Denver this season got Levine to thinking : <p> How should the Rockies build a pitching staff for a place that otherwise has humbled the greatest pitchers ever to push off a rubber ? Because the Rockies ' pitchers do not have the luxury of working 5 1/3 innings and then flying from Coors Field for the season , Levine compiled the statistics of all pitchers who have made at least four starts here . <p> ' We chose four starts as our minimum because one aspect we wanted to analyze was the attrition factor among our own starting pitchers as they continued to pitch here , ' Levine said . <p> The Rockies ' Kevin Ritz was 17-11 in 1996 , but 6-8 in 1997 and 0-2 in 1998 . <p> Pedro Astacio was 17-11 in 1999 , 12-9 in 2000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record $ 123.8 million contract with the Rockies , he got off to a 9-2 start , but then went 12-26 . <p> Six innings Maddux 's mark <p> The longer a pitcher plays with Coors Field , the more likely he 's going to get pummeled . <p> Unfortunately for the Rockies , Jason Jennings is following the trend . He was 16-8 in 2002 , his rookie of the year season , but went 12-13 last year and is 2-5 this year - including an 0-3 record and 6.43 ERA in four starts at <p> Coors Field . <p> ' Nobody is ever going to tame this place , ' Jennings said . ' You are n't going to have a 4.00 ERA . You might have a 6.00 . The key is giving your team a chance to win . I believe that more and more after every game I watch ( at Coors Field ) . ' <p> This is the 10th season of Coors Field and Rockies fans have seen plenty of great pitchers pass through . Clemens . Beckett . Randy Johnson . Pedro Martinez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans rarely have seen , however , is a great pitching performance . When the aces <p> arrive , they inherit the mind-set of a No. 5 pitcher . Realistically , their goal is less about dominating , and more about surviving . <p> ' I just try to go six innings , ' Maddux , now with the Chicago Cubs , said when interviewed for this story . ' I think if you go six <p> innings at Coors Field , you 've got a great chance to win . I do n't really worry about anything except going six innings . ' <p> Unbeknownst to the Rockies , the pedestrian outings of Clemens and Beckett moved The Denver Post to conduct its own study of Coors Field pitching performances . We came up with our subjective list of what most scouts would consider true aces . <p> As it turned out , our compilation of No. 1 starting pitchers had only a few differences from Levine 's ace list only because The Post did n't impose the four-start restriction . This explains why our ' aces ' group featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beckett while Levine 's list included the likes of Tom Glavine , Kevin Millwood and Hideo Nomo - pitchers with success at Coors Field but otherwise considered No. 2-type starters by scouts . <p> Still , our findings were almost identical to Levine 's : No. 1-type starting pitchers usually win - our group was 30-11 . That 's true even though they have a high ERA - Levine found that aces surrender , on average , an additional 1.5 runs per game at Coors Field - and give up more hits per inning . <p> Walks in the park a risk <p> A common component among the No. 1 starters ' won-lost success in Denver ? Superb strikeout-to-walk ratios . For different reasons , Maddux and former Atlanta Braves teammate John Smoltz have become the poster pitchers for Coors Field . Maddux has posted a 5.70 ERA and allowed a whopping 50 hits in 36 1/3 innings at Coors Field , yet has a 5-0 record at the ballpark . <p> Why ? Because he has issued just four walks here and , as he <p> explains , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of those parks where the most important thing is you ca n't walk anybody , ' said Millwood , who is 3-2 with a 3.97 ERA in seven starts at Coors Field . ' That 's true anywhere , but it 's more true at Coors Field than any ballpark in the majors . ' <p> But even Curt Schilling , arguably baseball 's best strike thrower - 936 strikeouts against 127 walks since he was traded from Philadelphia to Arizona in the 2000 season - has struggled at Coors Field , posting a 6.50 ERA in his past four starts here . <p> ' To me in the course of seven or eight innings , on an average day , you 're going to give up three or four hits that are outs anywhere but Coors , ' said Schilling , who probably will make a start at Coors Field when his Boston Red Sox visit for a three-game series June 15-17 . <p> Then there 's Smoltz , who this season espoused the three-three- <p> three innings theory for permanent rotation duty at Coors Field . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his past three seasons , pitching exclusively in relief for the Braves , Smoltz has not allowed a run or a walk in 7 2/3 innings in Denver , striking out 10 . <p> But before 2000 , when he primarily was a starter , he had a 6.23 ERA at Coors Field while allowing 38 hits in 26 innings . <p> Those numbers jibe with Levine 's research . The Rockies have had several relievers , most notably Steve Reed , who have succeeded for extended periods at Coors Field . But the next starting pitcher who puts together back-to-back great seasons for the Rockies will be the first . <p> ' I could n't imagine having to pitch here that many times , ' Millwood said . ' If you had to do it , you 'd remind yourself that it 's still the big leagues and you 'd have to get to the point where you 're fine with a 5.00 ERA . Which stinks , but that 's the way it is . ' <p> After a while at Coors , a 6.00 ERA does n't stink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reached at 303-820-5440 or mklis@denverpost.com . <p> The humbled ( but effective ) ace <p> How baseball 's No. 1 starters have fared at Coors Field : <p> PitcherW-L ERA IP H BB SO <p> Mark Prior2-0 2.08 13.0 10 1 15 <p> Bartolo Colon1-0 2.70 6.2 7 2 8 <p> Pedro Martinez1-1 3.43 21.0 17 7 25 <p> Roy Oswalt1-0 3.86 7.0 10 0 6 <p> Kevin Brown5-3 3.93 55.0 65 15 40 <p> Randy Johnson5-2 4.02 53.2 52 16 70 <p> Josh Beckett2-0 4.15 13.0 11 5 9 <p> Kerry Wood0-0 5.25 12.0 13 3 12 <p> Curt Schilling4-3 5.35 79.0 108 15 67 <p> Roger Clemens1-0 5.59 9.2 14 6 9 <p> Greg Maddux5-0 5.70 36.1 50 4 17 <p> Jason Schmidt2-0 5.79 32.2 40 11 30 <p> John Smoltz1-2 6.23 26.0 38 5 27 <p> Totals30-11 4.73 365.0 435 90 335 <p> Coors Field statistics as a starter .  --  <p> Coors from the inside <p> The Rockies categorized starting pitchers from Nos. 1-5 and looked at how the best from each group fared at Coors Field ( minimum four starts ) . <p> Starter slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40-32 6.33 <p> No. 3 25-22 6.67 <p> No. 4 43-41 6.67 <p> No. 5 41-38 6.11
