1 On the night that I was born , my paternal grand-father , Josef Tock , made ten predictions that shaped my life . Then he died in the very minute that my mother gave birth to me . Josef had never previously engaged in fortune-telling . He was a pastry chef . He made clairs and lemon tarts , not predictions . Some lives , conducted with grace , are beautiful arcs bridging this world to eternity . I am thirty years old and ca n't for certain see the course of my life , but rather than a graceful arc , my passage seems to be a herky-jerky line from one crisis to another . I am a lummox , by which I do not mean stupid , only that I am biggish for my size and not always aware of where my feet are going . This truth is not offered in a spirit of self-deprecation or even humility . Apparently , being a lummox is part of my charm , an almost winsome trait , as you will see . No doubt I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to imply by " biggish for my size . " Autobiography is proving to be a trickier task than I first imagined . I am not as tall as people seem to think I am , in fact not tall at all by the standards of professionalor even of high schoolbasketball . I am neither plump nor as buff as an iron-pumping fitness fanatic . At most I am somewhat husky . Yet men taller and heavier than I am often call me " big guy . " My nickname in school was Moose . From childhood , I have heard people joke about how astronomical our grocery bills must be . The disconnect between my true size and many people 's perception of my dimensions has always mystified me . My wife , who is the linchpin of my life , claimsthat I have a presence much bigger than my physique . She says that people measure me by the impression I make on them . I find this notion ludicrous . It is bullshit born of love . If sometimes I make an outsized impression on people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Or stepped on their feet . In Arizona , there is a place where a dropped ball appears to roll uphill in defiance of gravity . In truth , this effect is a trick of perspective in which elements of a highly unusual landscape conspire to deceive the eye . I suspect I am a similar freak of nature . Perhaps light reflects oddly from me or bends around me in a singular fashion , so I appear to be more of a hulk than I am . On the night I was born in Snow County Hospital , in the community of Snow Village , Colorado , my grandfather told a nurse that I would be twenty inches long and weigh eight pounds ten ounces . The nurse was startled by this prediction not because eight pounds ten is a huge newbornmany are largerand not because my grandfather was a pastry chef who suddenly began acting as though he were a crystal-ball gazer . Four days previously he had suffered a massive stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side and unable to speak ; yet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making prognostications in a clear voice , without slur or hesitation . He also told her that I would be born at 10:46 p.m. and that I would suffer from syndactyly . That is a word difficult to pronounce before a stroke , let alone after one . Syndactylyas the observing nurse explained to my fatheris a congenital defect in which two or more fingers or toes are joined . In serious cases , the bones of adjacent digits are fused to such an extent that two fingers share a single nail . Multiple surgeries are required to correct such a condition and to ensure that the afflicted child will grow into an adult capable of giving the F-you finger to anyone who sufficiently annoys him . In my case , the trouble was toes . Two were fused on the left foot , three on the right . My mother , Madelainewhom my father affectionately calls Maddy or sometimes the Mad Oneinsists that they considered forgoing the surgery and , instead , christening me Flipper . Flipper was the name of a dolphin that once starred in a hit TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the program as " delightfully , wonderfully , hilariously stupid . " It went off the air a few years before I was born . Flipper , a male , was played by a trained dolphin named Suzi . This was most likely the first instance of transvestism on television . Actually , that 's not the right word because transvestism is a male dressing as a female for sexual gratification . Besides , Suzialias Flipperdid n't wear clothes . So it was a program in which the female star always appeared nude and was sufficiently butch to pass for a male . Just two nights ago at dinner , over one of my mother 's infamous cheese-and-broccoli pies , she asked rhetorically if it was any wonder that such a dire collapse in broadcast standards , begun with Flipper , should lead to the boring freak-show shock that is contemporary television . Playing her game , my father said , " It actually began with Lassie . In every show , she was nude , too . " " Lassie was always played by male dogs , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his point made . I escaped being named Flipper when successful surgeries restored my toes to the normal condition . In my case , the fusion involved only skin , not bones . The separation was a relatively simple procedure . Nevertheless , on that uncommonly stormy night , my grandfather 's prediction of syndactyly proved true . If I had been born on a night of unremarkable weather , family legend would have transformed it into an eerie calm , every leaf motionless in breathless air , night birds silent with expectation . The Tock family has a proud history of self-dramatization . Even allowing for exaggeration , the storm must have been violent enough to shake the Colorado mountains to their rocky foundations . The heavens cracked and flashed as if celestial armies were at war . Still in the womb , I remained unaware of all the thunderclaps . And once born , I was probably distracted by my strange feet . This was August 9 , 1974 , the day Richard Nixon resigned as President of the United States . Nixon 's fall has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver 's " Annie 's Song " was the number-one record in the country at the time . I mention it only to provide historical perspective . Nixon or no Nixon , what I find most important about August 9 , 1974 , is my birthand my grandfather 's predictions . My sense of perspective has an egocentric taint . Perhaps more clearly than if I had been there , because of vivid pictures painted by numerous family stories of that night , I can see my father , Rudy Tock , walking back and forth from one end of County Hospital to the other , between the maternity ward and the ICU , between joy at the prospect of his son 's pending arrival and grief over his beloved father 's quickening slide into death . z With blue vinyl-tile floor , pale-green wainscoting , pink walls , a yellow ceiling , and orange-and-white stork-patterned drapes , the expectant- fathers ' lounge churned with the negative energy of color overload . It would have served well as the nervous-making set for a nightmare about a children's-show host who led a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't improve the ambience . Rudy stood birth watch with only one other man , not a local but a performer with the circus that was playing a one-week engagement in a meadow at the Halloway Farm . He called himself Beezo . Curiously , this proved not to be his clown name but one that he 'd been born with : Konrad Beezo . Some say there is no such thing as destiny , that what happens just happens , without purpose or meaning . Konrad 's surname would argue otherwise . Beezo was married to Natalie , a trapeze artist and a member of a renowned aerialist family that qualified as circus royalty . Neither of Natalie 's parents , none of her brothers and sisters , and none of her high-flying cousins had accompanied Beezo to the hospital . This was a performance night , and as always the show must go on . Evidently the aerialists kept their distance also because they had not approved of one of their kind taking a clown for a husband . Every subculture and ethnicity has its objects of bigotry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he muttered unkind judgments of his in-laws . " Self-satisfied , " he called them , and " devious . " The clown 's perpetual glower , rough voice , and bitterness made Rudy uncomfortable . Angry words plumed from him in exhalations of sour smoke : " duplicitous " and " scheming " and , poetically for a clown , " blithe spirits of the air , but treacherous when the ground is under them . " Beezo was not in full costume . Furthermore , his stage clothes were in the Emmett Kelly sad-faced tradition rather than the bright polka-dot plumage of the average Ringling Brothers clown . He cut a strange figure nonetheless . A bright plaid patch blazed across the seat of his baggy brown suit . The sleeves of his jacket were comically short . In one lapel bloomed a fake flower the diameter of a bread plate . Before racing to the hospital with his wife , he had traded clown shoes for sneakers and had taken off his big round red rubber nose . White greasepaint still encircled his eyes , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rumpled porkpie hat . Beezo 's bloodshot eyes shone as scarlet as his painted cheeks , perhaps because of the acrid smoke wreathing his head , although Rudy suspected that strong drink might be involved as well . In those days , smoking was permitted everywhere , even in many hospital waiting rooms . Expectant fathers traditionally gave out cigars by way of celebration . When not at his dying father 's bedside , poor Rudy should have been able to take refuge in that lounge . His grief should have been mitigated by the joy of his pending parenthood . Instead , both Maddy and Natalie were long in labor . Each time that Rudy returned from the ICU , waiting for him was the glowering , muttering , bloody-eyed clown , burning through pack after pack of unfiltered Lucky Strikes . As drumrolls of thunder shook the heavens , as reflections of lightning shuddered through the windows , Beezo made a stage of the maternity ward lounge . Restlessly circling the blue vinyl floor , from pink wall to pink wall , he smoked and fumed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Of course you do n't . But snakes can fly . I 've seen them high above the center ring . They 're well paid and applauded , these cobras , these diamondbacks , these copperheads , these hateful vipers . " Poor Rudy responded to this vituperative rant with murmured consolation , clucks of the tongue , and sympathetic nods . He did n't want to encourage Beezo , but he sensed that a failure to commiserate would make him a target for the clown 's anger . Pausing at a storm-washed window , his painted face further patinated by the lightning-cast patterns of the streaming raindrops on the glass , Beezo said , " Which are you having , Rudy Tocka son or daughter ? " Beezo consistently addressed Rudy by his first and last names , as if the two were one : Rudytock . " They have a new ultrasound scanner here , " Rudy replied , " so they could tell us whether it 's a boy or girl , but we do n't want to know . We just care is the baby healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he raised his head , thrusting his face toward the window as if to bask in the pulsing storm light . " I do n't need ultrasound to tell me what I know . Natalie is giving me a son . Now the Beezo name wo n't die when I do . I 'll call him Punchinello , after one of the first and greatest of clowns . "
