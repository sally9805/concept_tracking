PART OF THE SOLUTION OR PART OF THE PROBLEM <p> HUMANITY IS increasingly confronted with rapidly emerging large-scale environmental problems . In the last three years alone , the SARS epidemic  --  although largely contained in the end  --  spread rapidly from Southeast Asia to different points around the globe ; Hurricane Katrina and its aftereffects devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast region ; and a smelting operation accidentally released high levels of the carcinogen cadmium into China 's Xiang River basin . <p> All such problems require immediate action to minimize suffering but are often aggravated by the gradual effects of previous shortsighted policies . These problems combine complex ecological mechanisms with difficult sociopolitical dilemmas . They are characterized by periodic , unpredictable events , creating a difficult choice between short-run responses that address symptoms  --  " quick fixes "  --  and more fundamental changes in our economy and lifestyles that remove or reduce the long-run drivers of the problems . <p> Quick fixes are sometimes appropriate because they work sufficiently well and/or buy time to design longer-term solutions . Moreover , although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on such quick fixes rather than incur the political costs of discouraging causal activities . Opposition to fundamental solutions stems from four sources that must be dealt with : lack of understanding of ecological mechanisms , failure to recognize the gravity of the problem , vested interests , and absence of institutions to address public goods and intergenerational choices effectively . <p> Environmental problems are often ignored until they reach crisis proportions . Incidents such as the 1948 " killer smog " in Donora , Pennsylvania ; Cleveland 's Cuyahoga River fire of 1969 ; and the Niagara Falls , New York , Love Canal neighborhood investigation ( begun in 1978 ) linking health effects to a toxic waste dump all helped to create momentum for the remarkable burst of U.S. environmental legislation between the late 1970s and the early 1980s . Minamata Disease , a debilitating neurological syndrome brought on by exposure to methylmercury , played a similar role in Japan during the 1960s and 1970s after it was found that industrial mercury waste had contaminated seafood , exposing the population of Minamata to high doses of the substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to enact a countrywide logging ban in 1989 and the Chinese government to ban logging in selected provinces in 1998 . <p> Unfortunately , crisis-driven responses do not always provide long-run solutions to complex policy problems . A principal reason is that they may address the symptoms of problems instead of their causes . This is liable to happen with many of today 's regional and global environmental problems , and advocates of action on these problems must guard against it as they try to push environmental problems up policymakers ' agendas . By failing to address root causes , policy responses that treat the symptoms of environmental problems can undermine sustainability by increasing the probability of future environmental disasters , the damage caused by those disasters , or both . Worse , they can mask ongoing deterioration that ultimately leads to irreversible environmental damage . This risk has grown as the scale of human impact on the environment has increased and has subjected natural systems to unprecedented perturbations . <p> In reflecting on the potential problems with " quick fixes "  --  shorthand for policy responses that focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to note that such responses are not always simple or cheap . Indeed , they often involve large-scale engineering projects . Looking at specific problems , three discussions will serve as important background : the risk of irreversible changes that result from inherently nonlinear natural systems being pushed beyond thresholds ; the ways in which quick-fix responses contrast with responses that address the underlying causes of environmental degradation ; and examples in which quick fixes can sometimes complement more fundamental solutions . Problems with Quick Fixes <p> The literature on societal responses to earthquakes , storms , floods , and other natural hazards offers lessons for dealing with environmental problems . Over time , confidence in the ability of technology to control nature and secure safety has given way to the view that ambitious hazard-mitigation projects can actually raise the risks associated with natural hazards . Research reveals that " natural " disasters sometimes are manifestations of broader and more basic problems and that in such cases mitigation efforts can either worsen the effects of disasters when they occur or merely postpone them. 1 <p> A recent dramatic example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2005 , which illustrates how quick fixes can aggravate long-run problems . Ironically , New Orleans 's vulnerability to Katrina was partly due to previous flood-mitigation measures , in particular the building of higher levees after catastrophic floods in 1927. 2 The Mississippi River floods periodically as a natural consequence of heavy rainfall . Over the past century , flood controls allowed the development of farms , industries , and towns in areas prone to flooding . The effect was to put more assets at risk. 3 When flood damage still occurred , the response was to rebuild and raise the levees . This aggravated the fundamental problem because the river silted up and rose while the surrounding land subsided . The levees isolated the river from its floodplain , eliminating its capability to disperse floodwaters . <p> The 250-year history of efforts to tame the Rhine by straightening its channel , draining wetlands , and diking and developing its floodplain provides a similar example of one short-term measure leading to another , with the ultimate result being more flood damage instead of less. 4 <p> In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would involve partly restoring the river to its natural course and rebuilding the floodplains and delta that once gave the city protection  --  basically , restoring ecosystem services. 5 <p> A range of current environmental problems also offers a choice between quick fixes and more fundamental solutions ( see Table 1 below for a brief overview ) : <p> <p>  --  Global climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions . The fundamental solution is to reduce the use of fossil fuels . Quick fixes include a variety of adaptation measures , such as building dikes in low-lying coastal areas , strengthening building codes to cope with more powerful tropical storms , and shifting to different crops . Other potential fixes are aimed at reducing the net increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases that result from continued burning of fossil fuels . One example of this is the capture of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) and its storage underground or in deep ocean waters . Another such quick fix that has been put forward involves fertilizing the sea with iron filings , which would increase plankton productivity , hypothetically removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water 's surface convert CO 2 into organic carbon ) . 6 <p> <p>  --  Regional climate change due to aerosol emissions . The 3 kilometer-thick " brown cloud " that covers much of the Indian subcontinent and the northern Indian Ocean has evidently caused South Asia 's climate to become drier. 7 The cloud consists of minute particles of black carbon and other aerosols generated by the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass . It reduces surface solar radiation , thus reducing evaporation from the northern Indian Ocean and weakening the life-giving monsoon rains . The fundamental solution would involve shifting toward cleaner fuels , improving the efficiency of combustion processes , and installing more pollution-control equipment . Quick fixes include measures to cope with reduced precipitation , such as greater reliance on groundwater , investment in irrigation , river basin transfers , and the development of more drought-tolerant crops . <p> <p>  --  Degradation of the Baltic Sea . The Baltic Sea is in a degraded state due to a combination of pollution and overfishing. 8 High levels of phosphorous and nitrogen inputs from various sources are causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-green algae was one of the worst ever recorded ( see Figure 1 ) , with negative effects on tourism , recreation , and fisheries . Algal blooms and overfishing have significant effects on food web structures , and economically important fish species are now at record low levels , with cod catches down 80 percent from the peak of the 1980s . The decline of the cod stock has increased the zooplankton-eating Atlantic herring population , perhaps further increasing phytoplankton biomass . An additional complication is that sedimentation has increased and , together with decreased inflow of water through the Danish sounds , has reduced oxygen concentration in deep waters . Consequently , the deeper sediments have shifted from being a sink for phosphorus to a source . The fundamental solution is to reduce point and nonpoint sources of water pollution and reduce overfishing , but recovery is uncertain given the coupling of changes in the trophic structure with the changed dynamics of the phosphorus cycle ( which is quite similar to problems in freshwater lakes 9 ) . A drastic quick fix that has been discussed for reducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea with more nitrogen during the spring bloom and oxygenating the deep waters. 10 The increased spring bloom would reduce available phosphorous in the water , and oxygenation of deeper waters would minimize leakages of phosphorous from the sediment . <p> <p>  --  Overfishing . Overfishing is spreading to even the most remote fisheries. 11 The long-term solution must involve institutional change that alters fishers ' and fishing nations ' incentives , using instruments like tradable quotas or local management schemes . Instead , governments have often responded to declining catches by increasing the subsidies provided to fishers , which simply pushes fisheries closer to collapse . Another quick fix for declining catches might be aquaculture , but biodiversity is inevitably lost , and some modern forms of aquaculture are unsustainable. 12 Culturing carnivorous species like salmon depends on fish feed inputs , which increase the need for intensive fishing for low-trophic-level species . Aquaculture also introduces the potential for genetic pollution , pathogen spread , and habitat destruction . <p> <p>  --  Global pandemics . For respiratory zoonoses like SARS or avian flu , 13 which spread from animals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal disease reservoirs ; for example , modifying farming methods in which human nutrients ( from human waste ) are recycled to ponds where pigs and chickens feed and dealing with situations where human population densities and poverty promote the rapid exchange of genetic material between pathogens . We also need to strengthen the institutions intended to reduce the risk of pandemic spread , whether the risk occurs through natural mechanisms or terrorism. 14 The International Health Regulations ( IHR under the World Health Organization ) require countries to undertake extensive surveillance but do not provide poor countries with the means to do so . The gravity of human suffering from epidemics mandates remedies such as vaccines or medicine stockpiles , although these are partly quick fixes : Overuse of vaccines and antibiotics for medical/veterinary purposes can provoke resistance buildup that worsen the long-run situation . <p> Many of the quick fixes in these examples may increase the risk of degradation beyond the point of no return . Natural systems are typically nonlinear , which may cause unexpected thresholds beyond which lie abrupt , disastrous , and maybe even irreversible changes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geophysical and ecological feedbacks , such as the weakening of the North Atlantic Current and potential consequent cooling of Western Europe as ocean salinity changes and as methane is released when tundra permafrost melts. 16 An emphasis on adaptation instead of emissions reductions increases the risk that such changes will occur . An analogous risk evidently exists for South Asian drying caused by brown clouds . One recent study demonstrates that a threshold could be crossed that would shift the region 's climate to a permanently drier state , 17 which would be disastrous for rice production . The experience of Canadian cod fisheries is an example of a dramatic irreversibility : Despite a decade-long fishing ban , there is still no sign of recovery . <p> The long-term systemic impacts of quick fixes are generally poorly understood , suggesting that caution is needed before proceeding with large-scale projects such as fertilizing the sea with iron filings or sequestering CO 2 underground or in deep ocean waters . The suggested quick fix for the summer blue-green algae problem in the Baltic  --  to fertilize the sea with nitrogen during the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An increased spring bloom would increase the internal load of phosphorus from sediments , which could in the long run make the problem worse . Furthermore , blue-green algae are an important food source for fish in summer . Relying on a larger spring bloom to restore the balance may therefore further reduce fish catches because species depending on the summer bloom would be affected negatively . A Fix that Works <p> Quick fixes are not always undesirable . The case of acid rain indicates that they can complement policies that address root problems . With acid rain , the fundamental solution is to cut emissions , as many European countries have done . However , it took several decades from the discovery and analysis of this problem until emissions and deposition were reduced . Some countries like Sweden have a lower buffering capacity in many ecosystems  --  largely because of old geological formations with little calcium . This was one important factor making the problems of acid rain more noticeable and more serious there despite the fairly small levels of local emissions . Sweden has spent considerable resources liming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reduced. 18 Hindsight shows this quick fix was , on the whole , positive . It kept pH high , saving many sensitive fish species , and no major unpleasant side effects have been discovered . Had this not been done , a number of affected ecosystems would have suffered irreversible damage long before deposition levels were sufficiently reduced . Why Quick Fixes ? <p> Humanity has become a major force in perturbing ecosystem dynamics at multiple scales . Although many people have benefited from the conversion of natural ecosystems to human-dominated ecosystems , these gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of losses in biodiversity and resilience and degradation of many ecosystem services that human societies and globally interconnected economies rely on. 19 Short-term goals and targets in management are insufficient for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems . Thus , reactive short-sighted responses to large-scale disturbances have led to uncertainty and surprises in services and flows of resources generated by ecosystems to society. 20 <p> Why are quick fixes so appealing ? Many quick fixes involve large-scale engineering projects , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hidden while their short-run benefits appear big , particularly for incumbents seeking reelection . This adds to the problem that market interest rates do not fully reflect the welfare of future generations . Using conventional discount rates for environmentally sensitive projects tends to favor current consumers and may negatively affect future generations by discounting their costs . <p> In contrast , addressing underlying causes generally involves restraining behavior through environmental taxes or regulations that might not appear to generate obvious immediate benefits . Restraining behavior is often seen as removing a " right , " which is politically difficult , particularly if those affected can organize . To deal with these problems , instrument design must take care to mitigate distributional effects by differentiating taxes , refunding tax revenues , or giving away resource rents to the polluters ( or other influential groups ) to buy acceptance. 21 An example is free allocation of the initial set of tradable pollution permits . Monitoring difficulties , asymmetric information , and multiple and overlapping jurisdictions ( as in the case of the Baltic Sea ) are additional institutional challenges that confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental problem may be that governments can not commit to follow wise long-run policies ; thus , populism trumps rationality . The ubiquity of this problem explains the advantages of lifetime judges in independent courts , 23 constitutions that require qualified majorities , and parliaments that relinquish control over monetary policy to experts in central banks . Such rationality is particularly evident in Icelandic fisheries management , where institutions that set total allowable catch are cleverly separated from the contentious issue of share distribution among fishermen . Similar mechanisms are needed for many other environmental problems . Politicians must give authority to institutions to make global decisions and bind themselves to their recommendations . We need permanent yet adaptive policy organizations to monitor and deal with environmental problems so that we can react with sufficiently speedy policy modifications. 24 <p> Quick fixes can sometimes contribute to a favorable political dynamic for solving environmental problems . The liming of lakes in Sweden illustrates this . Unlike the projects that raised levees along the Mississippi River , it did not defer action on the fundamental solution ( in Sweden 's case , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes not been limed but allowed to acidify , their ecosystem functions and recreational values would have been lost . If those losses had been seen as permanent , public pressure to reduce emissions might have fallen and thus undermined the political will for action . When quick fixes are deployed , it is useful to tie them to long-run abatement measures such as using the proceeds of a sulfur tax to finance the liming of lakes . <p> New approaches to governance are thus necessary for guiding management and policy of ecosystem services toward sustainability . Along with new understanding and insights of the dynamic interplay that takes place across temporal and spatial scales in socioecological systems , longer-term goals and targets are needed to guide policy and actions . Policymakers must pay particular attention to how feedbacks from short-run solutions affect future options . Knowledge of system dynamics is vital to judge whether any given intervention , whether a quick fix or a more fundamental solution , will have negative or positive effects . <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
