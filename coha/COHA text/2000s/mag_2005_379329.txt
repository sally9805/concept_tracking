Rwanda is best known for the 1994 genocide in which Hutu tribesmen killed 800,000 of their Tutsi rivals . Coffee , one of the country 's biggest exports , was also a casualty of that massacre . For Michigan State University professor Dan Clay , a specialist in Third World agricultural development , rebuilding Rwanda 's coffee industry proved a double-edged challenge : how to get the industry on its feet yet avoid the commodity trap that dooms many farmers to subsistence living in a world where coffee is abundant . <P> The solution was to go upmarket and try to make Rwanda more famous for fabulous coffee than for murder . Rwanda has the ideal climate for growing quality beans , and its coffee has " notes of fruit and pecan , " says David Griswold , president of Sustainable Harvest , a coffee importer . " It has a taste you ca n't find anywhere else in the world . " <P> Getting that unique taste to market required a new approach . So Clay  --  with Texas A &M; professor Tim Schilling ; Emile Rwamasirabo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aided by the U.S. Agency for International Development  --  formed the Partnership for Enhancing Agriculture in Rwanda through Linkages ( PEARL ) . One idea : create cooperatives whose farmers , 20% of whom are genocide widows or orphans , learn a multistep process for producing gourmet coffee that involves harvesting only the ripest beans and washing , sorting and drying them at new community washing stations . <P> Ironically , Rwandans do n't traditionally drink coffee . So importer Griswold took his customers to Rwanda to brew coffee with the farmers , showing them exactly the kind of taste and consistent quality the market is looking for . The farmers were taught to detect notes of blackberry , the consequences of improperly processing beans , and how coffee is graded . <P> Since 2001 , PEARL has assisted 11 cooperatives with 15,000 members . " It 's small , but it 's growing like wildfire , " says Clay , an American who worked in Rwanda before fleeing the violence . The co-ops ' income has jumped from $650,000 in 2004 to $1.2 million in 2005 and is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drip in the $11.4 billion world coffee market , but to farmers like Triphine Mukamyasiro , 23 , whose family was killed in the genocide , it 's huge . She made $30 annually when she started selling coffee in 1993 . After joining a PEARL co-op , she began earning some $400 a year , about twice as much as the typical Rwandan takes home . Christian Ruzigama , 41 , returned to find his plantation in tatters . Now , with his profits , he has built a house and sends his children to school . <P> Rwandan beans are jumping these days : this year 's crop sold out , with Green Mountain coffee , Whole Foods and other companies eagerly buying . " Rwanda has gone from being completely unknown to being the hottest coffee origin in 2005 , " says Schilling , who runs PEARL in Rwanda . <P> PEARL had to solve the farmers ' credit-financing issues too . Farmers ca n't wait six to nine months between harvest and payment . So PEARL partnered with EcoLogic Finance , a Cambridge , Mass. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to set up financing for the co-ops , which are too large for micro loans .
