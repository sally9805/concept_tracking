My name is Lisa di Antonio Gherardini , though to acquaintances I am known simply as Madonna Lisa , and to those of the common class , Monna Lisa . My likeness has been recorded on wood , with boiled linseed oil and pigments dug from earth or crushed from semiprecious stones and applied with brushes made from the feathers of birds and the silken fur of animals . I have seen the painting . It does not look like me . I stare at it and see instead the faces of my mother and father . I listen and hear their voices . I feel their love and their sorrow , and I witness , again and again , the crime that bound them together ; the crime that bound them to me . For my story begins not with my birth but a murder , committed the year before I was born . It was first revealed to me during an encounter with the astrologer two weeks before my birthday , which was celebrated on the fifteenth of June . My mother announced that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would request a new gown , for nowhere has sartorial ostentation been practiced more avidly than my native Florence . My father was one of the city 's wealthiest wool merchants , and his business connections afforded me my pick of sumptuous silks , brocades , velvets , and furs . But I did not want a gown . I had recently attended the wedding of my uncle Lauro and his youngbride , Giovanna Maria . During the celebration afterward , my grandmother had remarked sourly : " It can not last happily . She is a Sagittarius , with Taurus ascendant . Lauro is Aries , the Ram . They will constantly be butting heads . " " Mother , " my own had reproached gently . " If you and Antonio had paid attention to such matters --  " My grandmother had broken off at my mother 's sharp glance . I was intrigued . My parents loved each other , but had never been happy . And I realized that they had never discussed my stars with me . When I questioned my mother , I discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well-to-do Florentine families often consulted astrologers on important matters , and charts were routinely drawn up for newborns . And I was a rare creature : an only child , the bearer of my family 's hopes . And as an only child , I was well aware of the power I possessed ; I whined and pleaded pitifully until my reluctant mother yielded . Had I known then what was to follow , I would not have pressed so hard . Because it was not safe for my mother to venture out , we did not go to the astrologer 's residence , but instead summoned him to our palazzo . From a window in the corridor near my bedroom , I watched as the astrologer 's gilded carriage , its door painted with his familial crest , arrived in the courtyard behind our house . Two elegantly appointed servants attended him as he stepped down , clad in a farsetto , the close-fitting man 's garment which some wore in place of a tunic . The fabric was a violet velvet quilt , covered by a sleeveless brocade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His body was thin and sunken-chested , his posture and movements imperious . Zalumma , my mother 's slave , moved forward to meet him . Zalumma was a well-dressed lady-in-waiting that day . She was devoted to my mother , whose gentleness inspired loyalty , and who treated her slave like a beloved companion . Zalumma was a Circassian , from the high mountains in the mysterious East ; her people were prized for their beauty and Zalumma -- tall as a man , with black hair and eyebrows and a face whiter than marble -- was no exception . Her tight ringlets were formed not by a hot poker but by God , and were the envy of every Florentine woman . At times , she muttered to herself in her native tongue , which sounded like no language I had ever heard ; she called it " Adyghabza . " Zalumma curtsied , then led the man into the house to meet my mother . She had been nervous that morning , no doubt because the astrologer was the most prestigious in town and had , when the Pope 's forecaster had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to remain out of view ; this first encounter was a business matter , and I would be a distraction . I left my room and stepped lightly to the top of the stairs to see if I could make out what was going on two floors below me . The stone walls were thick , and my mother had shut the door to the reception chamber . I could not even make out muffled voices . The meeting did not last long . My mother opened the door and called for Zalumma ; I heard her quick steps on the marble , then a man 's voice . I retreated from the stairs and hurried back to the window , with its view of the astrologer 's carriage . Zalumma escorted him from the house -- then , after glancing about , handed him a small object , perhaps a purse . He refused it at first , but Zalumma addressed him earnestly , urgently . After a moment of indecision , he pocketed the object , then climbed into his carriage and was driven away . I assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised that a man with such stature would read for a slave . Or perhaps my mother had simply forgotten to pay him . As she walked back toward the house , Zalumma happened to glance up and meet my gaze . Flustered at being caught spying , I withdrew . I expected Zalumma , who enjoyed teasing me about my misdeeds , to mention it later ; but she remained altogether silent on the matter . Continues ...
