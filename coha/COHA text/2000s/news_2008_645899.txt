Russell Crowe was supposed to play opposite Nicole Kidman in " Australia , " an epic romance set Down Under during World War II . But the combative actor had a dustup with 20th Century Fox over his salary . As he put it at the time , " I do n't do charity work for major studios . " <p> Hugh Jackman was closer in at least one way to what Aussie director Baz Luhrmann had in mind for his leading man . Luhrmann envisioned an exclusively Australian cast . Who better to tell the history of his country ? While Crowe is from New Zealand , Jackman is Australian born and bred . After all his success , he and his wife and two children still make their home in Melbourne . <p> Jackman plays a cattle herder known as the Drover , a word that means cowboy in Aussie-speak . Kidman is a proper Englishwoman who meets him when she comes to Australia to unload the family 's cattle farm . It 's not giving anything away to say the two fall in love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Film buffs will see similarities to the best work of David Lean and Clint Eastwood . The storyline about riding herd over 1,500 head of cattle has echoes of " Red River . " <p> This could be a breakthrough role for Jackman , who has had his biggest success so far as Wolverine in the " X-Men " movies . Tall and wiry , he 's a good-looking bloke who would be much improved without all the weird facial hair he wears for Wolverine . <p> From a New York hotel suite , he talked about taking over another actor 's part in " Australia " and what it was like to smooch with his co-star . <p> Not at all . I have made a career out of coming off the bench . I was not the first person to be offered Wolverine either . <p> I do n't know if it was rewritten for me . But Baz was rewriting all the time and probably playing to our strengths - who we were as people - as much as he could . <p> There is always an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was none .

We had never kissed before , so it was something we needed to talk about before . I do n't think I will tell you the details of that conversation . But needless to say , we were very adult about it . I ca n't say it was the hardest day at the office . <p> You rarely ever go to a place that changes you , but Kimberley was one of those places . It is so enormous in scale , so massive , that you feel quite humble and small and insignificant . At the same time , you feel very safe . You feel part of the land . It is a really terrific feeling . The things that seem to matter to you in everyday life but probably should n't just melt away .

I could do some riding - I rode a horse in " Kate &amp; Leopold . " But the riding in " Australia " took it to a whole other level . I love that side of acting - learning to do new things . I trained every day for eight months . Baz built an outdoor arena on the site where we could ride . We had fake cowboys training a horse on how to deal with cattle . I did almost all my own riding in the movie . <p> I 'm too tall to compete in the Kentucky Derby . They had to get me a big horse to look good . Otherwise you look silly , like you are riding a pony at a kid 's party .

But it 's a prequel to the other films and starts more than 100 years earlier . Wolverine has a regenerative ability to heal himself , so he could be 200 . He 's always been a mysterious character with a half-dozen different interpretations of his origin . Our film will be one of them . You 'll see a lot of new characters , too . <p> I heard that .
