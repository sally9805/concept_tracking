<p> Two nationally acclaimed Stanford doctors may have falsified data and omitted surgical complications in a medical journal article describing a series of controversial operations they performed on women eight years ago , according to court documents released this week . <p> A review of medical records of 16 women who were operated on by Drs . Camran and Farr Nezhat and their colleagues in Atlanta in 1991-92 found discrepancies of " the highest order " when the records were compared with an article the doctors wrote about the surgeries and published in a medical journal . <p> The Nezhats , who have practices in Palo Alto and Atlanta , claimed that the procedures they performed through " minimally invasive surgery " were superior to earlier surgical techniques and would benefit as many as 185,000 women who suffer from a medical condition called endometriosis of the rectum . In the article , the Nezhats reported that " no unusual short- or long-term ill effects were evident . " <p> But the review of the 16 cases found that the operating times were twice as long as reported and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major blood loss , intestinal injury and fecal incontinence , according to the court documents . <p> During the past five years , 20 doctors and surgeons from around the country have signed statements expressing concern about the Nezhats ' surgeries and published research and have called for an investigation . <p> Some physicians have called the procedures " bizarre " and " barbaric " experiments and have charged that they were performed on vulnerable women without sufficient consent . <p> The sworn affidavits , based on a review of 4,510 pages of medical records , were filed by Drs . Nick Spirtos and Tom Margolis earlier this year as part of a medical malpractice lawsuit in Fulton County Court in Atlanta . Spirtos and Margolis are serving as unpaid expert witnesses for the plaintiff in the case . <p> The two doctors , who , like the Nezhats , are voluntary faculty at Stanford Medical School , have been frequent critics of the Nezhat brothers . <p> In their affidavits to the court , Spirtos and Margolis said : " Either the 16 records submitted for review are different patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of September 1992 , or they are the same patients , which would make the article data flagrantly fraudulent . " <p> Fulton County Judge Melvin Westmoreland unsealed the affidavits without comment Wednesday . <p> Spirtos and Margolis asked the court to allow their audit of the records to be released because they felt " an ethical responsibility to communicate this information to the medical community due to the continued risk to the public safety . " <p> In a response filed yesterday with the court , attorneys for the Nezhats charged that Spirtos and Margolis have " a long history of personal and economically motivated bias and antagonism directed toward the Nezhats . " <p> " The affidavits are so rife with false statements that one must wonder whether Drs . Spirtos and Margolis were truthful even in stating that they had reviewed the records . " <p> Despite allegations that they conducted unethical and fraudulent medical research , the Nezhats enjoy strong support from Stanford University Medical School , where the brothers are clinical professors . <p> University officials have insisted that all allegations against the Nezhats have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , 58 Stanford physicians recently wrote a letter to The Chronicle declaring that the Nezhats " have brought with them a standard of surgical excellence , professionalism and integrity that we have admired and that has enriched our community . " <p> STANFORD NEVER SOUGHT RECORDS <p> But Stanford officials acknowledge that they have never reviewed the records of the controversial 16-patient series of surgeries . Nor have they asked the Nezhats for the records so that they could be compared with the journal article . <p> Yesterday , Stanford attorney Deborah Zumwalt said university officials would be interested in looking at Spirtos ' and Margolis ' affidavits . " We 'll look at anything anyone has done to review the records , " she said . <p> " Clearly , we are interested in what the results are . It is hard to tell what 's going on without the underlying records . We 're concerned with assuring the best in care of our patients . We 've always been concerned with accuracy of research . " <p> The series of operations on the 16 women involved laparoscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body through dime-sized incisions . The Nezhats are internationally recognized pioneers in the field . <p> The patients were treated for severe endometriosis of the rectum , a condition in which uterine cells migrate and bind to the lower colon , causing debilitating pain . <p> During the operations , Camran Nezhat and his brother Farr , with colorectal surgeon Dr. Earl Pennington assisting , spent hours using laparoscopic techniques to remove endometrial tissue from the women 's bowels . <p> In the September 1992 article about the surgeries , Nezhat and his colleagues wrote that all patients " tolerated the procedure well , with no major intraoperative or postoperative complications noted . " <p> But according to the affidavits , three women suffered hemorrhage , one required a second operation on her ureter ( the tube from the kidney to the bladder ) , and another suffered bowel ischemia , a cutoff of blood supply to part of her intestines . Doctors had to perform an ileostomy on that patient , a temporary bypass of the intestine that pipes the contents of the bowel into a plastic bag . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patients and suggested that " the positive results in these first cases lead us to believe that this procedure will be recommended for additional patients . " <p> SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES <p> In addition to the complications omitted from the published report , the affidavits disclosed a number of significant discrepancies : <p>  --  In the article , the average operating time per surgery reported by the Nezhats was slightly longer than three hours . According to the affidavits , the average operating time reflected in the records is about six hours , " with patients undergoing surgical procedures lasting 8.5 hours and 10 hours . " <p>  --  The authors claimed in the article that the average blood loss was 77 cubic centimeters , with the exception of one patient who lost 400 cc . But the review of the medical records found three patients with losses of 1,800 cc , 1,200 cc and 800-1,000 cc , respectively . <p> " Some cases , " the affidavits said , " ( required ) either transfusion or the use of cell saver . " <p>  --  The article reported an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average stay was 4.8 days , Spirtos and Margolis said . <p> The operations , however , were declared a success by the Nezhats and Pennington in the journal article . <p> In press releases and presentations at medical conferences sponsored by Ethicon , the company that manufactured the surgical instruments used in the surgeries , the Nezhats promoted the procedure as a means of bringing relief to tens of thousands of women . <p> In their written response , Nezhat lawyers Henry Green and David Walbert accused Spirtos and Margolis of filing affidavits " replete with serious distortions and outright falsehoods . " <p> ATTORNEYS REBUT CHARGES <p> The attorneys wrote that the complications reported in the patients ' records routinely occur in bowel surgery and would not be normally reported in the journal article . They also cited anal incontinence and bowel dysfunction as common and temporary symptoms of such surgery and not complications . <p> They denied that any patients had to be readmitted as a consequence of the procedures or that the length of hospital stay was misreported by the Nezhats . The blood loss was normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood were caused by other procedures performed during the surgeries , not the rectal procedures , they wrote . <p> But Dr. David Miller , a Texas gynecologist who has published extensively in medical journals , said the affidavits raise serious concerns . <p> " If these complications ( as stated in the affidavits ) are true , they should have been reported . This appears to be fraud , " said Miller , a cancer specialist who is director of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas . <p> " If you say you operated only two or three hours and the evidence shows it is much longer , that is very serious misrepresentation . " <p> Dr. David Grimes , a former chief of obstetrics and gynecology at San Francisco General Hospital who briefly served as a paid expert witness for the plaintiff in the malpractice case , said the affidavits , coupled with previous testimony by Camran Nezhat that described a record-keeping system that can not directly link patient records to journal articles , raise " troubling concerns about the validity of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania , said it would be appropriate for Stanford to request to see the underlying medical records at issue . <p> " If I had physicians in my faculty embroiled in a major research controversy , I 'd feel obligated that Stanford 's interests and standards were protected , " he said . <p> THE MALPRACTICE CASE <p> The records lie at the heart of a 7-year-old malpractice case brought against the Nezhats and Northside Hospital in Atlanta by Stacey Mullen , a California woman who contends that she was maimed by the doctors in a similar procedure , which she calls an unauthorized experiment gone awry . <p> Mullen , 39 , argues in her lawsuit that she suffered severe complications as a result of the surgery , which ultimately required her to undergo a colostomy , a permanent operation that requires her to use a surgically implanted tube in her side to have a bowel movement . <p> Mullen 's case , however , was not included in either the medical journal report , even though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in the article . <p> The Nezhats contend that Mullen 's case was excluded from the article because her surgery was not experimental and because subsequent pathology reports determined she did not have rectal endometriosis in the first place . <p> Through their attorney , the Nezhats said Mullen 's surgery did not cause her bowel problems , which they say predated her operations in the Atlanta hospital . <p> Spirtos and Margolis were among five medical experts who were given copies of the 16 patient records after Judge Westmoreland agreed in December to allow Mullen 's attorneys to view them . <p> Spirtos said he believes most of the large body of research published by the Nezhats is fraudulent . <p> UNORTHODOX FILING SYSTEM <p> In a sworn 1994 affidavit , Camran Nezhat described a medical record filing system with 20,000 patients , each listed only alphabetically , with no index , no computer database and no cross-referencing by type of treatment , surgery performed or journal publication . <p> Spirtos and other skeptics insist that such a record-keeping system would make it virtually impossible to produce the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to link charts and data involving hundreds of patients treated as far back as 1982 . <p> Based on the affidavits , Miller said that if he published a journal he would go back and " critically evaluate " everything that the Nezhats published before allowing them to write for his journal . <p> " When you publish results , " he said , " you should have the records that substantiate everything you publish .
