The blind , overweight patient in the wheelchair has terrible pain in her back and burning pain in her legs . She also has advanced arthritis in her knees and end-stage circulatory disease , which have left her with two useless legs that are red , swollen and infected . Now her shoulder has started to hurt . She ca n't raise her arm to comb her hair . Five or six other things are wrong with her  --  she tells me about each . Some we can help ; most we ca n't . I tell her as much . <P> In my office , she listens carefully . I hardly ever have to repeat myself with Doris ( not her real name ) . She asks questions  --  mostly good ones . She needs lots of tests , various therapies . I ultimately recommend an operation on her shoulder . Sick , weakened by multiple symptoms and with lousy insurance , Doris is  --  surprise  --  a really good patient . She communicates efficiently with her doctors and treats us with respect and trust . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but her knowledge is helpful  --  never challenging . I 've talked about her with other doctors , and we agree on this : when you see Doris ' name on your day 's list , you know you 're going to work hard . But you 're usually glad her name is there . <P> Few patients realize how deeply they can affect their doctors . That is a big secret in medicine  --  one doctors hate to admit . We think about , talk about , dream about our patients . We went into clinical medicine because we like dealing on a personal , even intimate level with people who have chosen to put their bodies in our hands . Our patients make or break our days . <P> Take the compliment . Our career choice means we really do think that you  --  with your aches and pains  --  are more interesting than trading hot securities , more fun than a courtroom full of lawyers . Massaging the ego is the key to manipulating responsible types like doctors . When we feel your trust , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good patient are selfish ones . You will get more than free drug samples if your doctor is comfortable and communicates easily with you . You 'll get more of the mind that you came for , a mind working better because it 's relaxed  --  recalling and associating freely , more receptive to small , even subliminal clues . That means better medical care . But you should try to be a good patient for unselfish reasons too . We worry about you 60 hours a week . We gave up our 20s for you . Why not show us some love ? It 's not hard . <P> The medical relationship is intrinsically one-sided . It 's about you and your problem . I am going to find out more about you in the next 20 minutes than you will find out about me . Do n't fret about that . We do n't expect you to ask much about us . Good patients answer questions accurately and completely . They ask questions too . <P> But many patients talk too much . You might notice that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your chart . We need specific facts but not every fact in your life . Here 's a classic exchange : <P> How long has your shoulder hurt , Beatrice ? " Oh , for quite some time now . " But for how long ? How many months ? " Oh , at least since the wedding  --  well , then again it did act up a bit when Margaret came back from Ireland ... "
