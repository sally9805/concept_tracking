Ama climbed the path to the cave , as she 'd done for many days now , bread and milk in the bag on her back , a heavy puzzlement in her heart . How in the world could she ever manage to reach the sleeping girl ? Would the woman never leave the cave for more than a few minutes ? Ama came to the rock where the woman had told her to leave the food since she was n't allowed in the cave anymore . She put down the bag , but she did n't go straight home ; she climbed a little farther , up past the cave and through the thick rhododendrons , and farther up still to where the trees thinned out and the rainbows began . This part of the valley was where the streams and cascades ran most confusingly : shafts of green-white water would sink into potholes and emerge a little lower down , or gush upward in splintered fountains , or divide into myriad streamlets , or swirl round and round trapped in a whirlpool . When the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice grew over every surface , and under it all , the water could still be heard gushing and tinkling , and spray still escaped to the air for the rainbows to form . Ama and her dmon climbed up over the rock shelves and around the little cataracts , past the whirlpools and through the spectrum-tinted spray , until her hair and her eyelids and his squirrel fur were beaded all over with a million tiny pearls of moisture . The game was to get to the top without wiping your eyes , despite the temptation , and the sunlight sparkled and fractured into red , yellow , green , blue , and every color between right in front of Ama 's eyes , but she must n't wipe her hand across to see better until she got right to the top , or the game would be lost . Kulang , her dmon , sprang to a rock near the top of the little waterfall , and she knew he would turn at once to watch and make sure she did n't brush the moisture off her eyelashes except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing forward . Ama wiped her eyes , because the game was canceled by the surprise her dmon was feeling . As she pulled herself up to look over the edge , she gasped and fell still , because she had never seen a creature like this one : a bear , but four times the size of the black bears in the forest , and ivory white , with a black nose and black eyes that glared down from the top of the waterfall , only an arm 's length away from her . " Who 's that ? " said the voice of a boy , and while Ama could n't understand the words , she caught the sense easily enough . After a moment the boy appeared next to the bear : fierce-looking , with frowning eyes and a jutting jaw . And was that a dmon beside him , bird-shaped ? It was unlike any dmon she 'd seen before , but there was nothing else it could be . It flew to Kulang and chirruped briefly : Friends . We sha n't hurt you . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come up , " said the boy , and again her dmon made sense of it for her . Watching the bear with superstitious awe , she scrambled up to the top of the little waterfall and stood shyly on the rocks beside them . Kulang became a butterfly and settled for a moment on her cheek , but left it to flutter around the other dmon , who sat still on the boy 's hand . " Will , " he said , pointing to himself . She responded , " Ama . " Each said the other 's name , and very soon she grew less nervous , though Ama remained frightened of the boy almost more than of the bear : he had a horrible wound : two of his fingers were missing . She felt dizzy when she saw it . The bear turned away and trod along the milky stream , occasionally lying down as if to cool himself in the water , which was so close to his own color . The boy 's dmon took to the air and darted and fluttered with Kulang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . And what should the boy be looking for but a cave , with a girl asleep ? The words tumbled out of her in response . " I know ! I know where it is ! And she 's been kept asleep by a woman who says she is her mother , but no mother would be so cruel , would she ? She makes her drink something to keep her asleep , but I have some herbs to make her wake up , if only I could get to her ! " She spoke so quickly that Will could only shrug and spread his hands . It took the dmons a minute or more of talking before the understanding came into Will 's mind . " Iorek , " he called , and the bear lumbered along the bed of the stream , licking his chops , for he had just swallowed a fish . " Iorek , " Will said , " I think this girl is saying she knows where Lyra is . What I 'll do is go with her to have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrnison said nothing , but stood foursquare in the stream as Will concealed his rucksack behind a rock and buckled on the knife before clambering down through the rainbows with Ama . Will had to brush his eyes frequently and peer through the dazzle to see where it was safe to put his feet , and the mist that filled the air was icy . No wonder Iorek was enjoying the water ; Will could only imagine how much he had suffered from the heat of the journey . When they reached the foot of the falls , Will settled the knife more comfortably at his waist and wiped the moisture out of his eyes once more . Ama indicated that they should go carefully and make no noise , and they walked in single file down the slope , between mossy rocks and great gnarled pine trunks where the dappled light danced intensely green and a billion tiny insects scraped and sang . Down , and farther down , and still the sunlight followed them , deep into the valley , while overhead the branches tossed unceasingly in a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massive bole of a cedar , and looked where she was pointing . Through a tangle of leaves and branches he saw the side of a cliff rising up to the right , and partway up " Mrs Coulter , " he whispered , and his heart was beating fast . It was just a brief movement , but he waited a moment , and then he saw her fully . She came out from behind a buttress in the rock and made a gesture as if she were throwing ashes or dust away , and then she reached forward and shook out a thick-leaved branch . Had she been sweeping the floor with it ? Her hair was bound round with a scarf and her sleeves were rolled up . Will could never have imagined her looking so domestic . But there was a flash of gold , and that vicious monkey appeared , leaping up to the woman 's shoulder . Together , as if they suspected something , they looked all around , and suddenly Mrs Coulter did not look domestic at all . Ama was whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden monkey , because he was so greedy and cruel ; he liked to catch bats in the cave and tear their wings off while they were alive ; and Ama would n't go near the cave when the woman was therebut she never left ! What could they do ? " Does she have anyone else with her ? No soldiers , or anything like that ? " he said . But Ama did n't know . She had never seen soldiers , but people did talk about strange and frightening men , or they might be ghosts , seen on the mountainsides at night ... But there had always been ghosts in the mountains , everyone knew that . So they might not have anything to do with the woman . But she did have a pistol . Well , thought Will , if she does n't leave the cave and Lyra 's in there , I 'll have to go and pay a call . He said , " What is this drug you have ? What do you have to do with it to wake her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now ? " In her home , she said . Hidden away . " All right . Wait here and do n't come near . She must n't know that I know about you , and you must n't say that you know me . When do you next bring her food ? " Half an hour before sunset , Ama 's dmon said . " Bring the herbs with you then , " said Will . " I 'll meet you here . " She watched with great unease as he set off along the path . Surely he did n't believe what she had just told him about the monkey dmon , or he would n't walk so recklessly up to the cave . Actually , Will felt very nervous . All the noises of the forest seemed to be very clear as he walked along the path , and all his senses seemed to be purified , so that he was aware of the tiniest insects drifting in the sun shafts and the movement of the clouds above , even though all his attention was fixed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the angel dmon flew to his shoulder as a bright-eyed small bird with red wings . " Keep close to me , and watch that monkey . " " Then look to your right , " said Balthamos tersely . And Will saw a patch of golden light at the cave mouth that had a face and eyes and was watching them . They were no more than twenty paces away . He stood still , and the golden monkey turned his head to look in the cave , said something , and turned back . Will felt for the knife handle and walked on . When he reached the cave , the woman was waiting for him . She was sitting at her ease in the little canvas chair , with a book on her lap , watching him calmly . She was wearing traveler 's clothes of khaki , but so well were they cut and so graceful was her figure that they looked like the highest of high fashion , and the little spray of red blossom she 'd pinned to her shirt front looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dark eyes glittered , and her bare legs gleamed golden in the sunlight . She smiled . Will very nearly smiled in response , because her expression was so kindly . He was so unused to the sweetness and gentleness a woman could put into a smile that it almost unsettled him completely . " You 're Will , " she said in that low , intoxicating voice . " How do you know my name ? " he said harshly . " Lyra says it in her sleep . " " Where is she ? " " Safe . " " I want to see her . " " Come on , then , " she said , and got to her feet , dropping the book on the chair . For the first time since coming into her presence , Will looked at the monkey dmon . His fur was long and lustrous , each hair seeming to be made of pure gold , much finer than a human 's , and his little face and hands were black . Will remembered that face well from the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Latrom in the house in Headington : contorted with hate , the monkey had tried to tear him apart with his teeth until Will had slashed left-right with the knife and forced him backward , so that he could close the window and shut away Mrs. Coultour and her dmon in a different world . Will thought that nothing on earth would make him turn his back on that monkey now . But Balthamos was watching closely , and Will stepped carefully over the rocky floor of the cave and followed Mrs Coulter to the little still figure lying in the shadows . And there she was , his dearest friend , asleep . So small she looked ! He was amazed at how all that force and fire that was Lyra awake could look so gentle and mild when she was sleeping . At her neck Pantalaimon lay in his polecat shape , his fur glistening , and Lyra 's hair lay damp across her forehead . He knelt down beside her and lifted the hair away . Her forehead was hot . Out of the corner of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set his hand on the knife ; but Mrs Coulter shook her head very slightly , and the monkey let the tension go . Without seeming to , Will was memorizing the exact layout of the cave : the shape and size of every rock , the slope of the floor , the exact height of the ceiling above the sleeping girl . He would need to find his way through it in the dark , and this was the only chance he 'd have to see it first . " So you see , she 's quite safe , " said Mrs Coulter . " Why are you keeping her here ? And why do n't you let her wake up ? " " Let 's sit down . " She did n't take the chair , but sat with him on the moss-covered rocks at the entrance to the cave . She sounded so kindly , and there was such sad wisdom in her eyes , that Will 's mistrust deepened . He 'd been on guard , of course , ever since he 'd come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said was a lie , every action concealed a threat , and every smile masked an impulse of deceit . He would have to be doubly , trebly on guard , and he 'd have to deceive her as well . But maybe ( he thought with a little thrill of pleasure ) his own life had been preparing him for this all the time ; for he knew no one as good at deceiving as he had had to be . Right , he thought . I can deal with you . " Would you like something to drink ? " she said . " Look , I 'll have some too ... It 's quite safe . Look . " She cut open some brownish , wrinkled fruit and pressed the cloudy green juice into two small beakers . She sipped one and offered the other to Will , who had watched so closely he knew she could have put nothing in it ; so he sipped as well , and found it fresh and astringent . " How did you find your way here ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Evidently . Have you got Lyra 's alethiometer ? " " Yes , " he said , and let her work out for herself whether or not he could read it . " And you 've got a knife , I understand . " " Sir Charles told you that , did he ? " " Sir Charles ? Oh Carlo , of course . Yes , he did . It sounds fascinating . May I see it ? " " No , of course not , " he said . " Why are you keeping Lyra here ? " " To keep her safe , " she said , " because I love her . I 'm her mother . She 's in appalling danger and I wo n't let anything happen to her . " " Danger from what ? " said Will stolidly . " Well ... , " she said , and set her beaker down on the ground , leaning forward so that her hair swung down on either side of her face . When she sat up again , she tucked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled the fragrance of some scent she was wearing combined with the fresh smell of her body , and he felt disturbed and embarrassed . Mrs Coulter gave no indication that she 'd noticed , and went on : " Look , I 'm going to do something unlikely , Will , I 'm going to tell you the complete truth . I do n't know how you came to be mixed up with my daughter , and I do n't know what you know already , and I certainly do n't know if I can trust you ; but equally , I 'm tired of having to lie . So here it is : the complete and utter truth . " I found out that my daughter is in danger from the very people I used to belong to from the Church . Frankly , I think they would even kill her if they knew where she was . And I found myself in a dilemma , you see : obey the Church , or save my daughter . I was a faithful servant of the Church , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to it ; I served it with a passion . " But I had this daughter ... " She knows better than anyone that I did n't look after her well when she was young . She was taken away from me and brought up by strangers . Perhaps that made it hard for her to trust me . But when she was growing up , I saw the danger that she was in , and three times I 've tried to save her from it . This is the third time . I 've had to become a renegade and hide in this remote place , and now to learn that you found us so easily well , you can understand , that worries me . The Church wo n't be far behind . And they want to kill her , Will . They will not let her live . " " Why ? Why do they hate her so much ? " " Because of what they think she 's going to do . I do n't know what that is ; I wish I did , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I know is that they hate her , and they have no mercy , none . " She leaned forward , talking urgently and quietly and closely . " Why am I telling you this ? " she went on . " Can I trust you ? I think I have to . I ca n't escape anymore , there 's nowhere else to go . And you might be a friend . If you 're a friend of Lyra 's , you might be my friend too . And I do need friends , I do need help . Everything 's against me now . The Church will destroy me too , as well as Lyra , if they find us . Asriel , Lyra 's father , has no interest in me anymore . I 'm alone , Will , just me in a cave with my daughter , and all the forces of all the worlds are trying to track us down . And here you are , to show how easy it is to find us , apparently . What are you going to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you keeping her asleep ? " he said , stubbornly avoiding her questions . " Because what would happen if I let her wake ? She 'd run away at once . And she would n't last five days . " " Yes , " said Will . " But why do n't you explain it to her and give her the choice ? " " Do you think she 'd listen ? Do you think even if she listened she 'd believe me ? She does n't trust me . She hates me , Will . You must know that . She despises me . I , well ... I do n't know how to say it ... I love her so much I 've given up everything I had a great career , great happiness , position and wealth everything , to come to this cave in the mountains and live on dry bread and sour fruit , just so I can keep my daughter alive . And if to keep her alive I have to keep her asleep , then so be it . But I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for you ? " Will felt a jolt of shock and rage that Mrs Coulter had dared to bring his own mother in to support her argument . Then the first shock was complicated by Will 's knowledge that his mother , after all , had not protected him ; he had had to protect her . Did Mrs Coulter love her child more than Elaine Parry loved hers ? But that was unfair : his mother was n't well . Either Mrs Coulter did not know the boil of feelings that her simple words had lanced , or she was monstrously clever . Her sad and beautiful eyes watched blandly as Will reddened and then shifted uncomfortably ; and for a moment Mrs Coulter looked uncannily like her daughter . " But what are you going to do ? " she said . " Well , I 've seen Lyra now , " Will said , " and she 's alive , that 's clear , and she 's safe , I suppose . That 's all I was going to do . So now I 've done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to . " That did surprise her a little , but she mastered it . " You do n't mean I thought you might help us , " she said quite calmly , not pleading but questioning . " With the knife . I saw what you did at Sir Charles 's house . You could make it safe for us , could n't you ? You could help us get away ? " " I 'm going to go now , " Will said , standing up . She held out her hand . A rueful smile , a shrug , and a nod as if to a skillful opponent who 'd made a good move at the chessboard : that was what her body said . He was very nearly captivated . He liked her , because she was brave , and because she seemed like a more complicated and richer and deeper Lyra . He could n't help but like her . So he shook her hand , finding it firm and cool and soft . She turned to the golden monkey , who had been sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them that Will could n't interpret . Then she turned back with a smile . " Good-bye , " he said . She said quietly , " Good-bye , Will . " He left the cave , knowing her eyes were following , and he did n't look back once . Ama was nowhere in sight . He walked back the way he 'd come , keeping to the path until he heard the sound of the waterfall ahead . " She 's lying , " he said to Iorek Byrnison thirty minutes later . " Of course she 's lying . She 'd lie even if it made things worse for herself , because she just loves lying too much to stop . " " What is your plan , then ? " said the bear , who was basking in the sunlight , his belly flat down in a patch of snow among the rocks . Will walked up and down , wondering whether he could use the trick that had worked in Headington : use the knife to move into another world and then go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this world , pull her through into safety , and then close up again . That was the obvious thing to do , why did he hesitate ? Balthamos knew . In his own angel shape , shimmering like a heat haze in the sunlight , he said , " You were foolish to go to her . All you want to do now is see the woman again . " Will scowled , but it was true . He had been captivated by Mrs Coulter . All his thoughts referred to her : when he thought of Lyra , it was to wonder how like her mother she 'd be when she grew up ; if he thought of the Church , it was to wonder how many of the priests and cardinals were under her spell ; if he thought of his own dead father , it was to wonder whether he would have detested her or admired her ; and if he thought of his own mother ... He felt his heart grimace . He walked away from the bear and stood on a rock from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear cold air he could hear the distant tok-tok of someone chopping wood , he could hear a dull iron bell around the neck of a sheep , he could hear the rustling of the tree tops far below . The tiniest crevices in the mountains at the horizon were clear and sharp to his eyes , as were the vultures wheeling over some near-dead creature many miles away . There was no doubt about it : Balthamos was right . The woman had cast a spell on him . Nevertheless , it was pleasant and tempting to think about those beautiful eyes and the sweetness of that voice , and to recall the way her arms rose to push back that shining hair ... With an effort he came back to his senses and heard another sound altogether : a far-distant drone . He turned this way and that to locate it and found it in the north , the very direction he and Iorek had come from . " Zeppelins , " said the bear 's voice , startling Will , for he had n't heard the great creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same direction and then reared up high , fully twice the height of Will , his gaze intent . " How many ? " " Eight of them , " said Iorek after a minute , and then Will saw them too : little specks in a line . " Can you tell how long it will take them to get here ? " Will said . " They will be here not long after nightfall . " " So we wo n't have very much darkness . That 's a pity . " " What is your plan ? " " To make an opening and take Lyra through into another world , and close it again before her mother follows . The girl has a drug to wake Lyra up , but I ca n't understand what she says about how to use it , so she 'll have to come into the cave as well . I do n't want to put her in danger , though . Maybe you could distract Mrs Coulter while we do that . " The bear grunted and closed his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined in droplets of mist in the late afternoon light . " Balthamos , " he said , " I 'm going back into the forest now , to find a safe place to make the first opening . I need you to keep watch for me and tell me the moment she comes near her or that dmon of hers . " Balthamos nodded and raised his wings to shake off the moisture . Then he soared up into the cold air and glided down toward the treetops as Will clambered down below him to search for a world where Lyra would be safe . In the creaking , thrumming double bulkhead of the leading zeppelin , the dragonflies were hatching . The Lady Salmakia bent over the splitting cocoon of the electric blue one , easing the damp , filmy wings clear , taking care to let her face be the first thing that imprinted itself on the many-faceted eyes , soothing the fine-stretched nerves , whispering its name to the brilliant creature , teaching it who it was . In a few minutes , the Chevalier Tialys would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to be born . But for now , he was sending a message on the lodestone resonator , and his attention was fully occupied with the bow and his fingers as they played over the heavy stone . He transmitted : " To Lord Roke : " We are three hours from the estimated time of arrival at the valley . The Consistorial Court of Discipline intends to send a squad to the cave as soon as they land . It will divide into two units . " The first unit will fight their way into the cave and kill the child , removing her head so as to prove her death and bringing it back . As a secondary objective they are to capture the woman , though if that is impossible they are to kill her . " The second unit is to capture the boy alive and bring him back to the zeppelins . " The remainder of the force will engage the gyropters of King Ogunwe . They estimate that the gyropters will arrive shortly after the zeppelins . In accordance with your orders , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly directly to the cave , where we shall try to defend the girl against the first unit and hold them at bay until reinforcements arrive . " We await your response . " The answer came almost immediately . " To the Chevalier Tialys : " In the light of your report , here is a change of plan . " In order to prevent the enemy from killing the child , which would be the worst possible outcome , you and the Lady Salmakia are to involve the boy in your plans . If this involves allowing him to open another world and take her into it , then let him do so , and follow them through . Stay by their side at all times . " The Chevalier Tialys replied : " To Lord Roke : " Your message is heard and understood . The Lady and I shall leave at once . " The little spy closed the resonator and gathered his equipment together . " Tialys , " came a whisper from the dark , " it 's hatching . You should come now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been struggling into the world and eased it gently free of the broken silk . Stroking its great fierce head , he lifted the heavy antennae , still moist and curled , and let the creature taste the flavor of his skin until it was entirely under his command . Then he quickly slung the pack over his shoulder and sliced through the oiled fabric of the zeppelin 's skin . Beside him , the lady had mounted her dragonfly , and now she urged it through the narrow gap into the hammering gusts . The long , frail wings trembled as she squeezed through , and then the joy of flight took over the creature , and it plunged into the wind . A few seconds later Tialys joined her in the wild air , his mount eager to fight the swift-gathering dusk itself . The two of them whirled upward in the icy currents , took a few moments to get their bearings , and set their course for the valley . As darkness fell , this was how things stood . In his adamant tower , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the little figure beside the lodestone resonator , and every other report had been diverted , every part of his mind was directed to the news that came to the small square block of stone under the lamplight . King Ogunwe sat in the cabin of his gyropter , swiftly working out a plan to counter the intentions of the Consistorial Court , which he 'd just learned about from the Gallivespian in his own aircraft . The navigator was scribbling some figures on a scrap of paper , which he handed to the pilot . The essential thing , Ogunwe knew , was speed : getting his own troops on the ground first would make all the difference . The gyropters were faster in the air than zeppelins , but they were still some way behind . Strapped into their seats in the zeppelins , the grenadiers of the Swiss Guard were attending to their kit . Their crossbows were deadly over five hundred yards , and with the help of the newly developed Lanzspring lever , an archer could load and fire fifteen bolts a minute . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooves that gave the bolt a spin and made the weapon as accurate as a rifle . It was also , of course , silent , which in a situation like this was a great advantage . Mrs Coulter lay awake in the entrance to the cave . The golden monkey was restless , and frustrated : the bats had left the cave with the coming of darkness , and there was nothing to torment . He prowled about by Mrs Coulter 's sleeping bag , scratching with a little horny finger at the occasional glow-flies that settled in the cave and smeared their luminescence over the rock . Lyra lay hot and almost as restless , but deep , deep asleep , locked into oblivion by the draught her mother had forced down her only an hour before . There was a dream that had occupied her for a long time , and now it had returned , and little whimpers of pity and sorrow and rage and Lyratic resolution shook her breast and her throat , making Pantalaimon grind his polecat teeth in sympathy . Not far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ama were making their way toward the cave . Will had tried to explain to Ama what he was going to do , but her dmon could make no sense of it , and when he cut a window and showed her , she was so terrified that she nearly fainted . He had to move calmly and speak quietly in order to keep her nearby , because she refused to let him take the powder from her , or even to tell him how it was to be used . In the end he had to say simply , " Keep very quiet and follow me , " and hope that she would . Iorek , in his armor , was somewhere close by , waiting to hold off the soldiers from the zeppelins so as to give Will enough time to work . What neither of them knew was that there was another force also closing in : the wind from time to time brought a far-distant clatter to Iorek 's ears , but whereas he knew what zeppelin engines sounded like , he had never heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balthamos might have been able to tell them , but Will was troubled about him . The angel had been withdrawing farther into his grief : he had been silent , distracted , and sullen for some time . It made talking to Ama harder too . As they paused on the path , Will said to the air , " Balthamos ? Are you there ? " " Yes , " said the angel tonelessly . " Balthamos , please stay with me . Stay close and warn me of any danger . I need you . " " I have n't abandoned you yet , " said the angel . That was the best Will could get out of him . And in the buffeting midair , Tialys and Salmakia soared over the valley , trying to see down to the cave . The dragonflies would do exactly as they were told , but their bodies could n't easily cope with cold , and besides , they were tossed about dangerously in the wild wind . Their riders guided them low , among the shelter of the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings in the gathering dark . Part of Will 's reason for going to the cave that afternoon , of course , had been to see how the land lay and where he might best cut through , just as he 'd done in Sir Charles 's study in Headington . So now he and Ama crept up in the windy moonlight to the closest point they could reach that was still out of sight of the cave mouth . It happened to be behind a heavy-leaved bush just off the path , and there he cut a window in the air . Since he could now find his way into several different worlds , he tried five times before finding one that had the same conformation of ground . It was a bare , rocky place , where the moon glared down from a starry sky onto a bleached bone-white ground where little insects crawled and uttered their scraping , chittering sounds over a world-wide silence . Ama followed him through , fingers and thumbs moving furiously to protect her from the devils that must be haunting this ghastly place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lizard and scampered over the rocks with sharp feet . Will saw a problem . It was simply that the brilliant moonlight on the bone-colored rocks would shine like a lantern once he opened the window in Mrs Coulter 's cave . He 'd have to open it quickly , pull Lyra through , and close it again at once . They could wake her up in this world , where it was safer . He stopped on the dazzling slope and said to Ama , " We must be very quick and completely silent . No noise , not even a whisper . " She understood , though she was frightened . The little packet of powder was in her breast pocket , she 'd checked it a dozen times , and she and her dmon had rehearsed what they should do so often that she thought they could do it in total darkness . They climbed on , Will measuring it all carefully until he estimated that they would be well inside the cave . Then he took the knife and cut the smallest possible window he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make with thumb and forefinger . He put his eye to it quickly to keep the moonlight out and looked through . There it all was : he 'd calculated well . He could see the cave mouth ahead , the rocks dark against the night sky ; he could see the shape of Mrs Coulter , asleep , with her golden dmon beside her ; he could even see the monkey 's tail , trailing negligently over the sleeping bag . Changing his angle and looking closer , he saw the rock behind which Lyra was lying . He could n't see her , though . Was he too close ? He shut that window , moved back a step or two , and opened again . She was n't there . " Listen , " he said to Ama , " the woman has moved her and I ca n't see where she is . I 'm going to have to go through and look around the cave to find her , and cut through as soon as I 've done that . So stand back keep out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come back . If I get stuck there for any reason , go back and wait by the other window , where we came in . " " We should both go through , " Ama said , " because I know how to wake her , and you do n't , and I know the cave better than you do too . " Her face was stubborn , her lips pressed together , her fists clenched . Her lizard dmon acquired a ruff and raised it slowly around his neck . Will said , " Oh , very well . But we go through very quickly and in complete silence , and you do exactly what I say , at once , you understand ? " She nodded and patted her pocket yet again to check the herbs . Will made a small opening low down , looked through , and enlarged it swiftly , getting through in a moment on hands and knees . Ama was right behind him , and altogether the window was open for less than ten seconds . They crouched on the cave floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes taking some moments to adjust from the moon-drenched brilliance of the other world . Inside the cave it was much darker , and much more full of sound : the wind in the trees , largely , but below that another sound , too . It was the roar of a zeppelin 's engine , and it was n't far away . With the knife in his right hand , Will balanced himself carefully and looked around . Ama was doing the same , and her owl-shaped dmon was peering this way and that ; but Lyra was not at this end of the cave . There was no doubt about it . Will raised his head over the rock and took a long , steady look down toward the entrance , where Mrs Coulter and her dmon lay deep in sleep . Then his heart lurched . There lay Lyra , stretched out in the depths of her sleep , right next to Mrs Coulter . Their outlines had merged in the darkness ; no wonder he had n't seen her . Will touched Ama 's hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very carefully , " he whispered . Something was happening outside . The roar of the zeppelins was now much louder than the wind in the trees , and lights were moving about too , shining down through the branches from above . The quicker they got Lyra out , the better , and that meant darting down there now before Mrs Coulter woke up , cutting through , pulling her to safety , and closing again . He whispered that to Ama . She nodded . Then , as he was about to move , Mrs Coulter woke up . She stirred and said something , and instantly the golden monkey sprang up . Will could see his silhouette against the lights outside , crouching , attentive , and then Mrs Coulter herself sat up , shading her eyes to look outside . Will 's left hand was tight around Ama 's wrist . Mrs Coulter got up , fully dressed , lithe , alert , not at all as if she 'd just been asleep . Perhaps she 'd been awake all the time . She and the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening , as the light from the zeppelins swung from side to side above the treetops and the engines roared , and shouts , male voices warning or calling orders , made it clear that they should move fast , very fast . He squeezed Ama 's wrist and darted forward under the cover of the sounds from the sky , watching the ground in case he stumbled , running fast and low . Then he was at Lyra 's side , and she was deep asleep , Pantalaimon around her neck ; and then Will held up the knife and felt carefully , and a second later there would have been an opening to pull Lyra through into safety But he looked up . He looked at Mrs Coulter . She had turned around silently , and the glare from the sky , reflected off the damp cave wall , hit her face , and for a moment it was n't her face at all ; it was his own mother 's face , reproaching him , and his heart quailed from sorrow ; and then as he thrust with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wrench and a crack , the knife fell in pieces to the ground . It was broken . Now he could n't cut his way out at all .
