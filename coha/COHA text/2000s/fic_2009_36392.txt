A writer never forgets the first time he accepted a few coins or a word of praise in exchange for a story . He will never forget the sweet poison of vanity in his blood and the belief that , if he succeeds in not letting any &shy; one discover his lack of talent , the dream of literature will provide him with a roof over his head , a hot meal at the end of the day , and what he covets the most : his name printed on a miserable piece of paper that surely will outlive him . A writer is condemned to remember that mo &shy; ment , because from then on he is doomed and his soul has a price . <br> My first time came one faraway day in December 1917 . I was seventeen and worked at The Voice of Industry , a newspaper that had seen bet &shy; ter days and now languished in a barn of a building that had once housed a sulfuric acid factory . The walls still oozed the corrosive vapor that ate away at furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soles of shoes . The newspaper 's headquarters rose behind the forest of an &shy; gels and crosses of the Pueblo Nuevo cemetery ; from afar , its outline merged with the mausoleums silhouetted against the horizon  --  a skyline stabbed by hundreds of chimneys and factories that wove a perpetual twilight of scarlet and black above Barcelona . <br> On the night that was about to change the course of my life , the newspaper 's deputy editor , Don Basilio Moragas , saw fit to summon me , just before closing time , to the dark cubicle at the far end of the editorial staff room that doubled as his office and cigar den . Don Basilio was a forbidding- looking man with a bushy moustache who did not suffer fools and who subscribed to the theory that the liberal use of adverbs and adjectives was the mark of a pervert or someone with a vitamin deficiency . Any journalist prone to florid prose would be sent off to write fu &shy; neral notices for three weeks . If , after this penance , the culprit relapsed , Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Home " pages . We were all terrified of him , and he knew it . <br> " Did you call me , Don Basilio ? " I ventured timidly . <br> The deputy editor looked at me askance . I entered the office , which smelled of sweat and tobacco in that order . Ignoring my presence , Don Basilio continued to read through one of the articles lying on his table , a red pencil in hand . For a couple of minutes , he machine- gunned the text with corrections and amputations , muttering sharp comments as if I were n't there . Not knowing what to do , and noticing a chair placed against the wall , I slid toward it . <br> " Who said you could sit down ? " muttered Don Basilio without raising his eyes from the text . <br> I quickly stood up and held my breath . The deputy editor sighed , let his red pencil fall , and leaned back in his armchair , eyeing me as if I were some useless piece of junk . <br> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> I gulped . When I opened my mouth only a ridiculous , reedy voice emerged . <br> " A little , well , I do n't know , I mean , yes , I do write ... " <br> " I hope you write better than you speak . And what do you write  --  if that 's not too much to ask ? " <br> " Crime stories . I mean ... " <br> " I get the idea . " <br> The look Don Basilio gave me was priceless . If I 'd said I devoted my time to sculpting figures for Nativity scenes out of fresh dung I would have drawn three times as much enthusiasm from him . He sighed again and shrugged his shoulders . <br> " Vidal says you 're not altogether bad . He says you stand out . " <br> " Of course , with the sort of competition in this neck of the woods , one does n't have to run very fast . Still , if Vidal says so . " <br> Pedro Vidal was the star writer at The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and lurid events  --  the only thing worth read &shy; ing in the whole paper . He was also the author of a dozen modestly successful thrillers about gangsters in the Raval quarter carrying out bedroom intrigues with ladies of high society . Invariably dressed in im &shy; peccable silk suits and shiny Italian moccasins , Vidal had the looks and the manner of a matinee idol : fair hair always well combed , a pencil moustache , and the easy , generous smile of someone who feels comfortable in his own skin and at ease with the world . He belonged to a family whose forebears had made their pile in the Americas in the sugar business and , on their return to Barcelona , had bitten off a large chunk of the city 's electricity grid . His father , the patriarch of the clan , was one of the newspaper 's main shareholders , and Don Pedro used its offices as a playground to kill the tedium of never having worked out of necessity a single day in his life . It mattered little to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles that were beginning to circulate around Barcelona leaked oil : with its abundance of nobility , the Vidal dynasty was now busy collecting banks and plots of land the size of small principalities in the new part of town known as the Ensanche . <br> Pedro Vidal was the first person to whom I had dared show rough drafts of my writing when , barely a child , I carried coffee and cigarettes round the staff room . He always had time for me : he read what I had written and gave me good advice . Eventually , he made me his assistant and would allow me to type out his drafts . It was he who told me that if I wanted to bet on the Russian roulette of literature , he was willing to help me and set me on the right path . True to his word , he had now thrown me into the clutches of Don Basilio , the newspaper 's Cerberus . <br> " Vidal is a sentimentalist who still believes in those profoundly un-Spanish myths such as meritocracy or giving opportunities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Loaded as he is , he can allow himself to go around being a free spirit . If I had one hundredth of the cash he does n't even need I would have devoted my life to honing sonnets and little twittering nightingales would come to eat from my hand , captivated by my kindness and charm . " <br> " Senor Vidal is a great man ! " I protested . <br> " He 's more than that . He 's a saint , because although you may look scruffy he 's been banging on at me for weeks about how talented and hardworking the office boy is . He knows that deep down I 'm a softy and , besides , he 's assured me that if I give you this break he 'll present me with a box of Cuban cigars . And if Vidal says so , it 's as good as Moses coming down from the mountain with the lump of stone in his hand and the revealed truth shining from his forehead . So , to get to the point , because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and for all , I 'm offering you a head start , against wind and tide . " <br> " Thank you so much , Don Basilio . I promise you wo n't regret it . " <br> " Do n't get too carried away , boy . Let 's see , what do you think of the indiscriminate use of adjectives and adverbs ? " <br> " I think it 's a disgrace and should be set down in the penal code , " I replied with the conviction of a zealot . <br> Don Basilio nodded in approval . <br> " You 're on the right track , Martin . Your priorities are clear . Those who make it in this business have priorities , not principles . This is the plan . Sit down and concentrate , because I 'm not going to tell you twice . " <br> The plan was as follows . For reasons that Don Basilio thought best not to set out in detail , the back page of the Sunday edition , which was traditionally reserved for a short story or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The content was to have been a fiery narrative in a patriotic vein about the exploits of Catalan medieval knights who saved Christianity and all that was decent under the sun , starting with the Holy Land and ending with the banks of our Llobregat delta . Unfortunately , the text had not arrived in time or , I suspected , Don Basilio simply did n't want to publish it . This left us , only six hours be &shy; fore deadline , with no other substitute for the story than a full- page ad &shy; vertisement for whalebone corsets that guaranteed perfect hips and full immunity from the effects of buttery by-products . The editorial board had opted to take the bull by the horns and make the most of the liter &shy; ary excellence that permeated every corner of the newspaper . The problem would be overcome by publishing a four- column human interest piece for the entertainment and edification of our loyal family-oriented readership . The list of proven talent included ten names , none of which , needless to say , was mine . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of the champions on our payroll is on the premises or can be contacted in time . With disaster imminent , I have decided to give you your first crack at glory . " <br> " You can count on me . " <br> " I 'm counting on five double-spaced pages in six hours , Don Edgar Allan Poe . Bring me a story , not a speech . If I want a sermon , I 'll go to Midnight Mass . Bring me a story I have not read before and , if I have read it , bring it to me so well written and narrated that I wo n't even notice . " <br> I was about to leave the room when Don Basilio got up , walked round his desk , and rested a hand , heavy and large as an anvil , on my shoulder . Only then , when I saw him close up , did I notice a twinkle in his eyes . <br> " If the story is decent I 'll pay you ten pesetas . And if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll publish more . " <br> " Any specific instructions , Don Basilio ? " I asked . <br> " Yes . Do n't let me down . " <br> . . . <br> I spent the next six hours in a trance . I installed myself at a table that stood in the middle of the editorial room and was reserved for Vidal , on the days when he felt like dropping by . The room was deserted , sub &shy; merged in a gloom thick with the smoke of a thousand cigarettes . Closing my eyes for a moment , I conjured up an image , a cloak of dark clouds spilling down over the city in the rain , a man walking under cover of shadows with blood on his hands and a secret in his eyes . I did n't know who he was or what he was fleeing from , but during the next six hours he was going to become my best friend . I slid a page into the typewriter and without pausing , I proceeded to squeeze out everything I had inside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , every image and letter as if they were the last I was ever going to write . I wrote and rewrote every line as if my life depended on it , and then rewrote it again . My only company was the incessant clacking of the typewriter echoing in the darkened hall and the large clock on the wall exhausting the minutes left until dawn . <br> . . . <br> Shortly before six o'clock in the morning I pulled the last sheet out of the typewriter and sighed , utterly drained . My brain felt like a wasp 's nest . I heard the heavy footsteps of Don Basilio , who had emerged from one of his brief naps and was approaching unhurriedly . I gathered up the pages and handed them to him , not daring to meet his gaze . Don Basilio sat down at the next table and turned on the lamp . His eyes skimmed the text , betraying no emotion . Then he rested his cigar on the end of the table for a moment , glared at me , and read out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the streets carry the scent of gunpowder like the breath of a curse . <br> Don Basilio looked at me out of the corner of his eye and I hid be &shy; hind a smile that did n't leave a single tooth uncovered . Without saying another word , he got up and left with my story in his hands . I saw him walking toward his office and closing the door behind him . I stood there , petrified , not knowing whether to run away or await the death sentence . Ten minutes later  --  it felt more like ten years to me  --  the door of the deputy editor 's office opened and the voice of Don Basilio thundered right across the department . <br> " Martin . In here . Now . " <br> I dragged myself along as slowly as I could , shrinking a centimeter or two with every step , until I had no alternative but to show my face and look up . Don Basilio , the fearful red pencil in hand , was staring at me icily . I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pages and gave them back to me . I took them and turned to go as quickly as I could , telling myself that there would always be room for another shoeshine boy in the lobby of Hotel Coln . <br> " Take this down to the composing room and have them set it , " said the voice behind me . <br> I turned round , thinking I was the object of some cruel joke . Don Basilio pulled open the drawer of his desk , counted out ten pesetas , and put them on the table . <br> " This belongs to you . I suggest you buy yourself a better suit with it  --  I 've seen you wearing the same one for four years and it 's still about six sizes too big . Why do n't you pay a visit to Senor Pantaleoni at his shop in Calle Escudellers ? Tell him I sent you . He 'll look after you . " <br> " Thank you so much , Don Basilio . That 's what I 'll do . " <br> " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give you a week for the next one . But do n't fall asleep . And let 's see if we can have a lower body count this time  --  today 's readers like a slushy ending in which the greatness of the human spirit triumphs over adversity , that sort of rubbish . " <br> " Yes , Don Basilio . " <br> The deputy editor nodded and held out his hand to me . I shook it . <br> " Good work , Martin . On Monday I want to see you at the desk that belonged to Junceda . It 's yours now . I 'm putting put you on the crime beat . " <br> " I wo n't fail you , Don Basilio . " <br> " No , you wo n't fail me . You 'll just cast me aside sooner or later . And you 'll be right to do so , because you 're not a journalist and you never will be . But you 're not a crime novelist yet , even if you think you are . Stick around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two that will always come in handy . " <br> At that moment , my guard down , I was so overwhelmed by gratitude that I wanted to hug that great bulk of a man . Don Basilio , his fierce mask back in place , gave me a steely look and pointed toward the door . <br> " No scenes , please . Close the door . And happy Christmas . " <br> " Happy Christmas . " <br> . . . <br> The following Monday , when I arrived at the editorial room ready to sit at my own desk for the very rst time , I found a coarse gray enve &shy; lope with a ribbon and my name on it in the same recognizable type that I had been typing out for years . I opened it . Inside was a framed copy of my story from the back page of the Sunday edition , with a note saying : <br> " This is just the beginning . In ten years I 'll be the apprentice and you 'll be the teacher . Your friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
