Mo'Nique celebrates the season with family traditions of beloved foods , soulful flavors and lots of warm hospitality // Of all the holidays , Thanksgiving is probably my favorite . My hectic stand-up comedy schedule typically has me on the road most of the year , so I look forward to a total of four sons . It 's a time to reflect on the year and to give thanks for my many blessings . Thanksgiving is when I get to enjoy all my favorite foods . In addition to traditional fare such as roast turkey , corn bread dressing , yams and macaroni and cheese , there are family favorites like corn pudding , braised rabbit , stewed oxtails and even pigtails . Our holiday table is n't complete without Mom 's signature Orange Roughy With Crabmeat , which always takes center stage .

Including extended kin , as well as friends and folks who are n't able to be with their own families , there may be 20 or more of us gathered around the table . Last Thanksgiving was especially memorable . My twins had just come home from the hospital , and dinner was being held at my house . The table was all set , and we had gathered around so my father could bless the food . As he joined the circle , we bowed our heads and prepared for a heartfelt prayer . You know how Thanksgiving prayers drag on in some Black families . They 're like church sermons ; folks are nearly passing out trying to make it through the blessing . On this day , my father eyed all that good food , closed his eyes and uttered , " Thank you " and was done . No " Bless the food and the hands that prepared it . " No " Thank you for family and good friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of silence , thinking there was more to come , we opened our eyes to see if he was finished .
