<p> Killers walk the streets of Denver because witnesses are too intimidated to say what they saw . <p> Families of victims grieve with fading hopes for justice as years go by . Police bemoan the " anti-snitch " culture . Reward offers go unclaimed . <p> There were plenty of witnesses when a gunfight erupted in west Denver last year that a local pastor likened to the shootout at the O.K. Corral . <p> Five people were shot . Two died . The gunmen had been invited to a party by girls who presumably knew them . Yet , 19 months later , the deaths of Ronnie Hernandez and Eulices Vargas remain on Denver 's list of 83 unsolved murders since 2004 . <p> " I 'm pretty sure the girls knew who they were , " said Joe Gomez , Hernandez 's best friend . But " they got ta do what they got ta do . If they snitch , they might lose their lives . I know how it is . That happens to people all the time . " <p> Bruce Harrell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . <p> At a stoplight , 30th and Welton , another car pulled up . And on Jan. 11 , 2006 , Dianne Harrell 's birthday , someone shot her son to death . <p> The young man sitting beside Bruce survived . Twenty-one months later , nobody has been arrested . A family offer of $25,000 for information about Bruce 's killers has been met with silence . <p> " I 'm living in a nightmare , " Dianne Harrell said . " I just feel someone out there knows something and does n't want to come forward . " <p> She wonders if her son 's companion was the killer 's real target . She suspects he 's afraid to tell police who he saw . " You know , the thing with these witnesses , I think our government needs to do a better job of protecting these witnesses , " she said . <p> " Whoever hurt my son is gutless . They are snakes and scum of the earth , and obviously they do n't know Jesus . " <p> 742 names on grim list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos of young men he tried to help , the Rev. Leon Kelly compiled a list of those who " died violently - died young " in the Denver area . <p> It held 742 names from 1988 through January 2007 . Denver Broncos cornerback Darrent Williams was the newest entry . <p> Williams , Hernandez , Vargas and Harrell share a special distinction with about 40 other victims on that list . All were murdered . There were witnesses to each murder . And nobody has been arrested , though law enforcement sources say suspects in Williams ' death are behind bars on other charges . <p> The Williams murder " is just the tip of the iceberg . In all these cases there are people that know who did it . There are people who are running scared , " Kelly said . " As these gangs say , without witnesses there 's no case . " <p> To Kelly , the New Year 's Day shooting of a professional football star simply highlighted a problem that has plagued the Denver area for years . <p> " People like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " It 's Baltimore , Chicago , L.A. You do n't equate Denver with witness protection . You do n't equate Denver with this kind of violence . Vacation place , ski resorts . " <p> One unsolved murder has haunted Kelly for a decade . <p> In 1996 , a young Darryl Givens came to him to talk about testifying in a murder trial . <p> Gang leader Orlando Domena had chased down two rivals and shot them in the back , killing one . Givens had been sitting beside him in the car . He had to choose : Accomplice , or murder witness ? <p> " I suggested to him that he needed to go to Orlando and talk with him , explain it to him , " Kelly said : Why do two people need to spend their lives in prison instead of one ? <p> Givens took that advice . He came back to report that Domena had told him , " Do what you got ta do . " He took that as " a pass " to become a government witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing of his homeboy and his ' hood . " <p> In February 1996 , Givens took the stand and told the jury he had watched his friend shoot both men . Then he ran from the courtroom . <p> That October , he was found lying on a Denver street , shot to death . Eleven years later , his murder is unsolved . <p> In the past decade , witness intimidation " has gotten more aggressive because of the drugs , " Kelly said . " More recruits , more people feel it 's a matter of survival . ' This is our territory . This is our livelihood , you 're messing with my money now . ' Older guys are orchestrating young kids . It sort of aggravates the whole thing . " <p> Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey commonly sees witnesses threatened in gang-related and domestic-violence prosecutions . <p> In gang cases , including murders , " easily in three-fourths of those cases we see some kind of intimidation , " he said . " People who are willing to intimidate witnesses are attacking the criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . " <p> Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said the department 's performance in solving murder cases remains better than the national average . According to police records , 66 percent of Denver 's homicides last year have been cleared by arrests , slightly above the national rate of 61 percent . <p> But Jackson agreed an " anti-snitch " atmosphere is letting some killers go free . <p> " In most cases there are witnesses , " he said . But " there 's this cultural thing going on where they do n't want to be perceived as a snitch . " <p> Police are reaching out to reluctant witnesses by promoting the Crime Stoppers program , which enables people to call anonymously and even qualify for reward money without giving their names . <p> If witnesses feel they need to be protected , " we 'll do whatever we can to make sure that happens - if you 're willing to accept protection , " he said . <p> A bullet in the back <p> Joe Gomez grew up with Ronnie Hernandez . They played basketball and football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On March 19 , 2006 , Joe saw Ronnie die . And when he turned to run from the gunfire , he took a bullet in the back . <p> It all started innocently . Joe , Ronnie and another friend invited some girls over for a party . When most of the girls left , one said she knew a guy who could bring more girls . Instead , a roomful of guys showed up with one girl . By then , Joe and Ronnie 's sisters had also arrived separately . <p> The new guys were talking like they came from a different neighborhood 's gang . " They were saying , ' We 're Northside , we 're Northside , " ' Gomez said . <p> His sister and Ronnie 's sister , who did n't know the visitors , got nervous . " They said we have a bad feeling about this . Tell them to leave , " Gomez said . " Ronnie told them to leave . " <p> Most of the guys left , but one or two stayed behind , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomez said . " I ran to the door . Ronnie was down already . I turned , tried to run , fell to the floor . I did n't even know I got shot at the time . " <p> The bullet punctured his large intestine , filling his stomach with blood . " Am I going to live ? " he asked at the hospital . The doctor said he could n't promise anything . <p> Gomez believes at least five people were shooting at the house . " It lasted a long time . Boom , boom , boom-boom-boom , boom boom . Like a war going off . " <p> Eulices Vargas , who was also killed , was " with the group who called themselves ' Northsiders , " ' said the Rev. Mark Lopez , a local pastor who counseled the families after the shooting . No one has stepped forward to explain his death either . <p> " It looked like the O.K. Corral , " Lopez said of the scene . <p> Two years before Gomez lost his best friend , his 15-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at another house in west Denver . That murder also remains unsolved . <p> At night , Gomez sometimes asks why God is taking those closest to him . <p> " It 's hard , " he said . " I grew up with them . Now they 're gone . " <p> Priscilla Arzate , Hernandez 's mother , wonders why those who witnessed her son 's murder have not identified anyone involved . <p> Ronnie was hit four or five times . The bullets pingponged , punctured his lungs , his spinal cord , " she said . These girls who invited these kids obviously know who these guys are . I do n't blame them for being scared . I think they need to stand up .
