<p> AN academic colleague of mine once asked me who had made me into a writer . " And I do n't mean one of those creative writing professors , " he said to me , a creative writing professor . <p> " Well , who do you mean ? " I asked , probably ungrammatically , a thing creative writing professors get to do . <p> " I mean , who was your Shakespeare professor ? " he asked ; he was of course a Shakespeare professor himself . <p> I understood what he meant : Shakespeare was elemental , formative , fateful . Unlike the work of any writer before or since , Shakespeare 's plays and poetry , while taking advantage of an audience 's church-acquired tolerance for long speeches , celebrated the relatively new language of English and explored the strangeness within the ordinary and the familiar within the strange  --  the task of every artist . He returned again and again to the pathologies of love , marriage and family  --  interest in which is a prerequisite for embarkation on an American literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow at the Folger Library , was a brilliant , handsome , manic young man fairly fresh from Duke , who on the first day of class sang an entire verse of " Afternoon Delight , " clutching the lectern with bitter energy , to demonstrate to the students the all-pervasive and maddening junk he , as a Shakespearean , had been up against all summer . <p> He once diagrammed Hamlet as a sort of Pollock painting , with color-coded chalk for the characters . He directed us in a homemade film of " Romeo and Juliet , " the Capulets in red pinnies . But in general , he simply , convincingly communicated his love of the work and helped the plays come alive . When I recently met him again in Washington , he said , with unsuppressed glee : " How long are you in town for ? The Queen 's Folio is here ! " <p> Though many people have tried to insist that Shakespeare must have been a secret guild of theatricals , or the Earl of Oxford , or Sir Walter Raleigh , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the theory that Shakespeare is really Cliff Robertson ? " joked a friend of mine ) , there is no doubt the man existed . Those who are still skeptical may be the same people who , generally pessimistic about human ability , insist that the pyramids were built by space aliens , or that Joyce Carol Oates is really a committee of middle-aged men . Or else they are the same elitists who think things like the roots of rock ' n ' roll are actually white . <p> It seems clear  --  or at least we can say with a certain ad hoc confidence  --  that Shakespeare was born in Stratford-Upon-Avon 442 years ago today , the son of a Catholic mother and glovemaker father ( Christopher Marlowe , his contemporary , was the son of a shoemaker  --  anyone got a problem with that ? ) . He had one sister who lived into adulthood , and who may or may not have been the thwarted genius of Virginia Woolf 's imagining : " what would have happened had Shakespeare had a wonderfully gifted sister , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that she was named not Judith but Joan . He also had three younger brothers , all of whom preceded him in death . <p> Shakespeare 's eighth-grade education was enough to give him a good grasp of Latin , to help him land work perhaps as a legal assistant ( the plays are full of knowledge of the law as well as of gloves ) , a tutor , a horse-holder and an actor . How many writers have had jobs like these ? A lot . <p> According to Stephen Greenblatt 's impressive biography , " Will in the World , " Shakespeare 's father 's success then failure in the glove business may have prevented Shakespeare from going on to Oxford as many of his classmates ( and Christopher Marlowe ) did , but this is not the same as an insistence that he was too uneducated to have written the plays . <p> In Elizabethan England , apprentices abounded , as did pages and tutors , and Shakespeare would have easily made his way in that world . Actors had to know how to speak as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swords . The art and value of disguise , impersonation and adaptation is usually learned young . The father 's mercantile life would have given the young son an early indelible glimpse of all segments of society  --  rich and poor , rural and urban , successful and failed  --  and arguably gave Will , in part , the great comic character Falstaff : the drunken father figure whom the successful young man outgrows , outpaces and renounces , though not without a chilling soupcon of hate . <p> Shakespeare married early and , for practical reasons , someone older and richer ( where there 's a will , Anne Hathaway , the old quip goes ) and then left her behind to pursue revolutionary work in the world , only to return to her and take up companionship with her at the end . In this  --  and in his stalwart determination , knack for real estate and penchant for petty lawsuits  --  he is reminiscent ( to me ) of George Washington , whose marriage was made similarly coolly and for a good part of his life sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , while he annoyed the other army officers in New Jersey by dancing with their wives . <p> That Shakespeare 's most passionate loves were at first youthful and then adulterous is suggested by his plays , which scarcely have a happy marriage in them , let alone a happy family . Though one should n't look to fictional work as autobiography , a writer will always write from what is on his mind , and somewhat from what he knows , and so the intensity and buffoonery of youthful erotic love and the low miserable hum of marital discontent  --  famous as literary muses  --  were probably Shakespeare 's muses as well . Just as they were Charles Dickens 's ( another actor turned writer ) . And Edith Wharton 's . And ( remain ) Alice Munro 's . <p> The limberness of Shakespeare 's gift is arguably best demonstrated not by the greatest plays  --  " Hamlet , " " King Lear , " " Macbeth "  --  but by two that are considered more minor , one a tragedy , one a comedy , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the comedy is something of a satire on the tragedy . These are " Romeo and Juliet " and " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . " ( That they might have been accruing simultaneously on his writing table is one of those events writers and critics alike are fond of imagining . ) <p> Though they each have their various textual sources  --  Shakespeare , like Puccini , was a notorious artistic poacher , so much so that tales of Shakespeare 's actual poaching of game have attached themselves to his legend  --  they are distinctly Shakespearean in their look at love . <p> In " Romeo and Juliet , " however inconvenient Cupid 's choice , the energy of youthful love hurdles obstacles : " With love 's light wings did I o'erperch these walls , " says Romeo to Juliet , adding , " And what love can do , that dares love attempt . " Though at play 's end he is dead from his own hand , as is Juliet , victims in their own plot to outsmart the rather vicious society around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatist . Nor a greater comedian . <p> In " A Midsummer Night 's Dream , " a kind of buddy tale of mind and body on a fated forest trudge , erotic love is quite literally a drug , defying all solemnity and even intelligence , washing the brain in potions , something modern scientists have at long last proven to be an accurate occurrence . The most beautiful creature of the forest is made to fall in love with a blustery bumpkin by the sad name of Bottom , who through fairy mischief is now sporting the head of , well , an ass . A donkey 's head : this is grotesquerie worthy of a Tim Burton movie . And it is all in service of Shakespeare 's compassionate skepticism about love . <p> Each of these plays contains the other : " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " contains " Romeo and Juliet " in its enactment of the tragical tale of " Pyramus and Thisbe " but played for laughs : " These yellow cowslip cheeks/Are gone , are gone ! /Lovers make moan ; /His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Juliet " contains a window onto " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " in the comic relief of Romeo 's friend Mercutio , who throws barbs at the mere idea of romantic love to the comic approval of his entourage : " Prick love for pricking , and you beat love down . " <p> The structure of both these plays is intricate and geometrical . " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " moves easily in a single day among four different worlds and among the various romances giddily proceeding within them ( some with more elegance than others ) . At the end of " Romeo and Juliet " the body count perfectly , symmetrically comprises two Montagues , two Capulets and two relatives of the Prince . Death , not love , has the final blocking , though of course there is always the curtain call , and everyone is back up and alive again , as if to keep trying . Oh , why not . <p> Shakespeare 's London was one of the great cities of Europe , though smaller than Madison , Wis. , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern Belfast or Baghdad . When Shakespeare arrived in London as a young man he would have passed , impaled on the famous bridge into town , the skull of a distant cousin , killed for being a Catholic . How could this fail to leave an impression ? <p> He filled his early plays , written in his new home , with violent young men and angry mobs . When he left , rich and successful , it was to die ( at 52 ) of what doctors today have speculated was a rare cancer of the tear duct  --  an illness as cruelly ironic as that of Puccini 's cancer of the throat . His beloved Globe Theater had burned down . He could not have been happy . <p> But he did not know that his work would survive forever not just on stage but in book , screen and musical form  --  no one at that time could have . Or that his words would inspire their own honoring thefts : Joni Mitchell took a glittering simile of his for " That Song About the Midway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Man " borrowed his plots . <p> Washington , Dickens , Puccini and Tim Burton somehow merged into one : there 's your genius . Or the bare bard bones of him . <p> Add a dash  --  of Ogden Nash . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com <p> CORRECTION-DATE : April 25 , 2006 <p> CORRECTION : <p> An Op-Ed on Sunday , about Shakespeare 's birthday , misstated the university that Christopher Marlowe attended .
