The Realm of Freedom // On July 24 , 1959 , in the depths of the Cold War , Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev stood face-to-face , close enough to smell each other 's breath . Dozens of journalists and dignitaries crowded around them in increasingly nervous silence as the two argued heatedly . Khrushchev , the bald , brash son of Ukrainian peasants , raised his booming voice and waved his stubby hands in the air . Nixon , nearly a head taller , hovered over him , struggling to maintain his composure but then jabbing a finger into his adversary 's chest . Precipitating this superpower showdown was a disagreement over ... washing machines . // Nixon was in Moscow for the opening of the U.S. National Exhibition , a bit of Cold War cultural exchange cum oneupmanship that followed on the heels of an earlier Soviet exhibition in New York . He and Khrushchev were now in the fair 's star attraction : a six-room , fully furnished ranch house , bisected by a central viewing hallway that allowed visitors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to the house dismissively as the " Taj Mahal , " contending that it was no more representative of how ordinary Americans lived than the Taj Mahal was of home life in India . Actually , it was priced at $14,000 , or $100 a month with a 30-year mortgage-as Nixon put it , well within the reach of a typical steelworker. // Pausing before the model kitchen , packed with all the latest domestic gadgetry , Khrushchev blustered , " You Americans think that the Russian people will be astonished to see these things . The fact is that all our new houses have this kind of equipment . " He then proceeded to complain about the wastefulness of American capitalism-in particular , how foolish it was to make so many different models of washing machines when one would do . Nixon countered , " We have many different manufacturers and many different kinds of washing machines so that the housewives have a choice . " From there he expanded to broader themes : " Is n't it better to be talking about the relative merits of our washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't this the kind of competition you want ? " // Whereupon Khrushchev erupted , " Yes , this is the kind of competition we want . But your generals say they are so powerful they can destroy us . We can also show you something so that you will know the Russian spirit . " Nixon took the threat in stride . " We are both strong not only from the standpoint of weapons but from the standpoint of will and spirit , " he shot back . " Neither should use that strength to put the other in a position where he in effect has an ultimatum. " // What came to be known as the " kitchen debate " was a moment of almost surreal Cold War drama . Had it been written as a piece of fiction , the scene could be criticized justly for the belabored obviousness of its symbolism . Here the great historic confrontation between capitalism and communism presented itself in distilled miniature-as a duel of wits between two of the era 's leading political figures . Just as the Cold War combined ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscripted exchange fused both elements , as the disputants jumped from household appliances to nuclear doom without so much as a good throat clearing . Topping it all off , the spontaneous staging of the encounter in a transplanted American kitchen foreshadowed the Cold War 's eventual outcome : communism 's collapse in the face of capitalism 's manifest superiority in delivering the goods . In capitalism , it turned out , lay the fulfillment of communism 's soaring prophecies of mass affluence . // Richard Nixon made precisely this point during his formal remarks later that day at the official opening of the exhibition . He noted with pride that the 44 million American families at that time owned 56 million cars , 50 million television sets , and 143 million radios , and that 31 million of them owned their own homes . " What these statistics demonstrate , " Nixon proclaimed , " is this : that the United States , the world 's largest capitalist country , has from the standpoint of distribution of wealth come closest to the ideal of prosperity for all in a classless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of his career , on that particular occasion Richard Nixon spoke the truth . // A century earlier , Karl Marx had peered into the womb of history and spied , gestating there , a radical transformation of the human condition . The traditional " idiocy of rural life , " the newfangled misery of urban workers , would be swept away . The normal lot of ordinary people throughout history-to stand at the precipice of starvation-would be exchanged for a share in general abundance . In the new dispensation , the advanced development of productive forces would allow humanity 's physical needs to be met with only modest effort . Consequently , the " realm of necessity " would yield to the " realm of freedom . " // In that brave new realm , according to Marx , " begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself . " A forbidding bit of Teutonic abstraction : what exactly could it mean ? Marx was notoriously cryptic about his vision of utopia , but through the darkened glass of his dialectics we glimpse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lift their sights from the grim exigencies of survival . Freed from the old yoke of scarcity , they could concentrate instead on the limitless possibilities for personal growth and fulfillment. // It was Marx 's genius to see this coming transformation at a time when the main currents of economic thought led toward altogether drearier forecasts . Thomas Malthus , of course , made his name by arguing-with ample justification in the historical record-that any increase in wages for the poor would be dissipated by a swelling birth rate . Meanwhile , David Ricardo , second only to Adam Smith in the pantheon of classical economists , posited an " iron law of wages " that mandated bare subsistence as the equilibrium toward which labor markets tended . With prophetic insight , Marx grasped that the progress of industrialization would render such fatalism obsolete .... //
