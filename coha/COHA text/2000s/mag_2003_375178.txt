When it comes to guns , politicians are figuring out what clay pigeons have known for a long time : it 's safer to be a moving target . So it is that President Bush can win points with gun-control groups by sticking to his campaign promise to sign an extension on the assault-weapons ban when it expires next year , while House majority leader Tom DeLay can make the gun lobby happy by suggesting , as he did last week , that no such bill will ever reach Bush 's desk . And Democrats can fuss and fume over how Bush and the Republicans are trying to have it both ways  --  while quietly breathing a sigh of relief at being spared a vote that would expose the party 's own divisions on the issue . <P> The pantomime will continue , for behind it lies a new reality : two years into the Bush Administration , the gun lobby is on a winning streak .

Whereas married women were long thought to be the constituency most sympathetic to new restrictions on guns , they were the group most supportive of allowing pilots to be armed in the cockpit , according to focus groups conducted by Republican pollster David Winston . <P> Many Democrats are nervous about putting the gun issue on the front burner . House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called upon Bush to pressure G.O.P.
