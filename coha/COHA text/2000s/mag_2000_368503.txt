Perched on a hilltop in southwestern Virginia , the Oaks garnered its name from the seven historic oak trees , now more than 300 years old , that surround the Queen Anne Victorian house , built for a bride in 1889 . Its gardens unfold along Christiansburg 's Main Street , once part of the Wilderness Road forged by Daniel Boone , today close to the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway and a rails-to-trails bicycle path . <P> In 1989 , Margaret and Tom Ray bought and began restoring the property , which had been " remuddled , " says Margaret , by a previous owner . " A leaking bathroom ceiling fell in on the very day we were to open . People thought we were going to start up either a brothel or a dynamite factory , " she recalls . <P> All that has changed . The Rays added five bathrooms , four fireplaces , a new roof , fresh paint and hundreds of yards of window dressing . Some of the seven rooms are named after former inhabitants : Major Pierce , Bonnie Victoria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gourmet cook , may prepare a breakfast souffle of salmon , eggs and cheese , served with her special dill sauce , or her original shirred-egg , Parmesan and Portobello-mushroom concoction . <P> By tradition , the Oaks is a place for listening to crickets and watching mist hang over low-lying dips in the fields . But with high-tech industry moving into nearby Roanoke , the Rays have wired the inn to court midweek executives who want to carry on business in a relaxed , picture-perfect setting
