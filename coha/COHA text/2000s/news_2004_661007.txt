<p> When T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Pam Kossian asks new clients what ethical investing means to them , she can never be sure what they 'll say . <p> Example : One client refuses to own stock in any company that makes condoms because the Roman Catholic Church regards contraception as immoral interference with the procreative act . But another client actually insists on owning such shares in order to help control population growth and stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases . <p> Denise Mallett , director of client services at IdealsWork Financial in Portland , Maine , knows the feeling . In working with clients who use IW software to pick suitable stocks , she has several who wo n't touch tobacco . But she also has others from North Carolina who seek out tobacco holdings precisely because the golden leaf pays for schools and other good things in their state . <p> " The problem is , what 's socially responsible to one person is not socially responsible to someone else , " Ms. Mallett says . " Portfolios need to be customized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an age when consumers can get everything personalized from a Volvo to an Internet browser , ethically minded investors are finding their portfolios , too , can reflect a unique , even eccentric , set of values . Rather than settle for the priorities of one mutual fund or another , enterprising investors are buying shares only in the companies they respect and are building their own dream teams as a result . <p> Building such a custom portfolio brings additional challenge to the already tricky task of selecting winning stocks , since these winners must now come solely from a select pool of honorable companies . And to avoid those firms whose slick public relations hide a less-than-pretty reality , these investors could find themselves with a considerable research project on their hands . <p> But to get the job done quickly and efficiently , there are certain steps an investor can take . <p> Step one : Setting a policy <p> When customizing an ethical portfolio , investors should begin with a personal policy statement that spells out goals , screening criteria , and an allocation plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sample policy might aim for a 3 percent return over inflation , for instance , and avoid vice products - tobacco , alcohol , gambling . And if this investor strongly supports the war in Iraq and wants to invest in defense contractors , he or she could insist on that criterion as well . <p> No matter how much a person loves one company or industry , however , Mr. Kent says a policy needs to dictate diversity to ensure against a preference-driven imbalance . His bread-and-butter formula is to spread investments across large-cap , small-cap , and international stocks ; to include as many industries as the screening criteria will allow ; to own stock in at least 25 companies ; and to put no more than 5 percent of assets in any one company . <p> " If there 's a certain major industry that you leave out , you can skew results , " Kent says . " To avoid casinos or tobacco only would n't be a problem . But to avoid pharmaceuticals or healthcare altogether can create greater risk for your portfolio " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise their unique social standards , however , to invest profitably , says Ms. Kossian at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore . Never has she had to tell her clients that their screening standards were too onerous . Even the retired psychologist who refused to invest in notoriously stingy health-maintenance organizations , and the mother who avoided vaccinemakers because she felt they had caused autism in her son , were able to craft moneymaking portfolios that upheld their personal values . <p> Step two : Identifying possibilities <p> Once a personal policy is set , the challenge becomes finding companies poised not only to prosper but also to put the stamp of your values on the world . <p> At this stage , Robert Berridge , a vice president at Green Century Capital Management Inc. in Boston , would apply his own thorough formula . But for those with less time , he offers a tip : Limit your range of options to companies with ethical products . <p> " There are no real rules of thumb for ferreting out what a company is doing from what it says it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they donate to this or that cause , but maybe the core of what they 're doing is not so good . " <p> So , rather than spend days combing through corporate histories , Berridge suggests finding the best companies involved in the most ethical enterprises . Look among organic grocers , for instance , and consider a solid company like Whole Foods Market , he says . Or consider makers of alternative-energy products , such as Vestis , a manufacturer of wind turbines . <p> This technique saves time , Berridge says , and virtually guarantees that every holding in the portfolio is an ethically minded company . <p> But there can be drawbacks . He cites the case of AstroPower , a solar-power company with the greenest of products but a revenue stream that could have used a lot more green - that is , cash . Like Enron , another favorite among ethical investors at one time , AstroPower seemed to have artificially inflated its revenues before a sobering quarterly statement sent its stock price tumbling 50 percent in one day . <p> The lesson : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , according to Kossian , investors who want to see environment-friendly products roll off each of their assembly lines might be missing out on many good companies who bless the world in subtler ways . <p> " When you start the other way around , you may be holding a number of mediocre companies and be depriving yourself of the full universe of stocks to choose from , " Kossian says . " It 's possible to end up with tremendous underperformance over a long period of time . " <p> Kossian recommends instead considering ownership in any company with consistent earnings growth , competent management , and a unique advantage in its industry . Digging for those companies and weeding out the troublemakers could take lots of time , but as in yard work , a few powerful tools can save a lot of time and heartache . <p> Step three : Research fast and simple <p> Fortunately for today 's time-strapped investors , analysts have sorted through reams of corporate data and posted rankings in myriad categories on the Internet . ( See box at right . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values and you 're close to knowing which stocks to pick . <p> Besides the Web , special-interest newsletters and magazines will sometimes publish lists of the best companies for their particular concern , such as human rights , disabled employees , or gay and lesbian issues . A more specific source , The Green Pages published by Co-op America , provides a directory of contact information for socially and environmentally minded financial advisers . <p> Step four : Invest with caution <p> Diligent research , experts say , can keep investors from getting " green-washed , " or duped , by slick public relations that put a happy face on a sad situation . Yet even with all these tools at their disposal , experts themselves are sometimes misled . <p> Archer Daniels Midland Co. , for instance , was long heralded as the benevolent " supermarket to the world " for its international food-bank donations and underwriting of public broadcasting . But not until international press reports came out did investors become widely aware that the company was being sued for antitrust practices and price fixing in Brazil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Calvert Social Funds . <p> Publicly filed " information in its raw form is not very indicative of what 's happening at a company , " Ms. Daruwalla says . Investors can reduce risk based on faulty analysis , she adds , when they employ the analytical expertise of a socially responsible mutual fund . <p> Or they can take the approach of Mike Wood , a retired Delta Airlines pilot who trades stocks daily on his home computer in Hamilton , Mass . To advance his agenda to protect wildlife and limit population growth , he invests in whichever stocks seem poised to make money over a few days or weeks , and then he donates a slice of the profit to his favorite groups . <p> " Why not make $ 3,000 by trading Philip Morris in three days and give it to Greenpeace or the African Wildlife Foundation ? " Mr. Wood asks . <p> Yet for investors who want stocks that proclaim uniquely what they stand for , the information age has ushered in the best opportunity so far to make really good money - in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online <p> The Internet now makes available to diligent investors a wealth of resources for customizing a portfolio with dividends for wallet and conscience alike .
