Sometimes even a notebook computer is too bulky to carry around . But so far , tinier mini-PCs have n't taken off . Vulcan Inc. , started by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , may change that with its new FlipStart PC . Weighing in at less than 1 lb. and powered by a 1-GHz Transmeta processor , the FlipStart measures just 6 in. wide , 4 in. deep and 1 in. thick yet packs in a 30-GB hard drive and 256 MB of memory . Available in late 2004 , it also has special touches to make navigating its bright 6-in. , HDTV-quality display easier . A thumbwheel on the right helps you scroll up and down the page . A unique Middleman button pulls up a short list of commonly used functions for each application so you do n't have to wade through menus . And there 's a small touchpad for quickly moving your cursor around the screen .
