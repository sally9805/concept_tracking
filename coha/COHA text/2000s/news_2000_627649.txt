<p> The decade of the ' 90s in college women 's basketball belonged almost exclusively to the Lady Vols of Tennessee and the Huskies of Connecticut . <p> Nothing has changed as the first decade of the 21st century dawns . Get used to seeing Geno Auriemma 's face , because the Huskies are going to be as good as it gets for at least the next two years . <p> Oh , UConn 's sure to get a test from Tennessee and its Player of the Year candidate , Tamika Catchings . <p> But when the NCAA women 's champion is crowned in St. Louis next spring , look for the Huskies and Shea Ralph to have completed another streak to the summit . <p> 1 . CONNECTICUT <p> Last season : 36-0 , won NCAA title . <p> Coach : Geno Auriemma ( 393-95 , 15 years . ) <p> Key returnees : PG Sue Bird , 5-9 , Jr. ; F Svetlana Abrosimova , 6-2 , Sr. ; G/F Shea Ralph , 6-0 , Sr. ; F/C Kelly Schumacher , 6-5 , Sr. <p> Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G Maria Conlon , 5-9 , Fr. ; C Jessica Moore , 6-3 , Fr . <p> Key fact : The only NCAA Division I program , men or women , to rack up five consecutive 30-win seasons . <p> Overview : With Bird , Abrosimova and Ralph , UConn already has three of the country 's best players . And shot-blocker supreme Schumacher is back for her sophomore season , joining arguably the top recruiting class in the country . <p> Comment : Top-notch coaching and top-notch talent is the formula for another season at the top of the heap . <p> 2 . TENNESSEE <p> Last season : 33-4 , lost to UConn in NCAA championship game . <p> Coach : Pat Summitt ( 728-150 in 25 seasons at Tennessee ) . <p> Key returnees : F Tamika Catchings , 6-1 , Sr. ; C Michelle Snow , 6-5 , Jr. ; G Semeka Randall , 5-10 , Sr. ; G Kara Lawson , 5-6 , So. ; G April McDivitt , 5-7 , So . <p> Key newcomers : G Tasha Butts , 5-11 , Fr. ; F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6-1 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Tennessee is the only women 's program ever to win three straight NCAA championships . <p> Overview : Catchings will be the next Player of the Year nationally . The Lady Vols have the nation 's second-best freshman class . But even with Catchings , Clement and Randall back in the fold for the final time , along with a solid cast of newcomers , Summitt again will be playing catch-up . <p> Comment : Despite the talent and the coaching of Summitt , the Lady Vols must settle for second-best nationally a second straight year . <p> 3 .

There are seven scrappy guards and some lean front-liners ready to continue the tradition . But a more dominant player in the middle and a " signature " player elsewhere in the lineup are needed . <p> Comment : The Lady Bulldogs will cause Summitt and the Lady Vols some anxious moments in the Southeastern Conference . But on the national scene ? Landers will be denied again . <p> 4 . LOUISIANA TECH <p> Last season : 31-3 , lost to Penn State in NCAA Midwest finals . <p> Coach : Leon Barmore ( 489-74 in 17 seasons at Louisiana Tech ) . <p> Key returnees : C Takeisha Lewis , 6-2 , Jr. ; C Ayana Walker , 6-2 , Jr. ; G Brooke Lassiter , 5-9 , Jr . <p> Key newcomers : F Ovlina Lewis , 6-1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G Amber Obaze , 5-9 , Fr . <p> Key fact : The Lady Techsters have won the last eight Sun Belt regular-season titles and the last five conference tournament titles . <p> Overview : Joining the now-he's-retired , now-he's-not Barmore in returning are seven letter-winners and all five starters , which should put the Lady Techsters into the mix nationally . <p> Comment : Barmore 's heavy-handed coaching methods might have finally worn thin and could keep the Lady Techsters from attaining the brass ring again . <p> 5 . PURDUE <p> Last season : 23-8 , lost to Oklahoma in NCAA East second round . <p> Coach : Kristy Curry ( 23-8 in one season at Purdue ) . <p> Key returnees : C Camille Cooper , 6-4 , Jr. ; G/F Katie Douglas , 6-1 , Jr . <p> Key newcomers : C Mary Jo Noon , 6-5 , Fr. ; F Elisa Inman , 6-2 , Fr . <p> Key fact : The Boilermakers have been to the Final Four only twice in the 18-year history of the NCAA Women 's Tournament . <p> Overview : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better use a talent-laden roster to its greatest advantage . <p> Comment : Four returning starters , including Douglas and the vastly improved Cooper , have the Boilers back on track for 2000-01 . <p> 6 .

There are four returning starters , but if the Tigers have a shortcoming , it 's lack of size . <p> Comment : Youth was the great destroyer last year . Experience will be one of the greatest assets this year . <p> 8 .

Not with 6-5 senior Riley roaming the paint . She 's the leading scorer , rebounder and shot-blocker for the Fighting Irish , who made it to the Sweet 16 last year . <p> Comment : Though already one of the best in Big Ten history , Riley will open even a few more eyes as a senior . <p> 9 . PENN STATE <p> Last season : 30-5 , lost to UConn in the NCAA semifinals . <p> Coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons at Penn State ) . <p> Key returnees : F Karen Walseth , 6-3 , Jr. ; G Lisa Shepherd , 5-11 , Jr. ; G Chrissy Falcone , 5-6 , Jr. ; F Rashana Barnes , 6-1 , Jr . <p> Key newcomers : C Jacquelynn Shook , 6-5 , Fr. ; F Courtney Upshaw , 6-4 , Fr. ; G Kelly Mazzante , Fr. ; F Jessica Brungo , 6-1 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Andrea Garner , taken by the Comets , was one of two seniors picked in the fourth WNBA draft . Garner later was traded to Seattle . <p> Overview : Overall depth helps counter the loss of Garner and point guard Helen Darling . Sophomore Ashley Luke backed up Darling last year .

OKLAHOMA <p> Last season : 25-8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sherri Coale ( 53-63 in fours seasons at Oklahoma ) . <p> Key returnees : G Stacey Dales , 6-0 , Jr. ; F Caton Hill , 6-1 , So. ; G LaNeishea Caufield , 5-9 , Jr . <p> Key newcomers : G Stephanie Luce , 5-6 , Fr. ; F Jamie Talbert , 6-2 , Jr. ; G Rosalind Ross , 5-9 , Jr . <p> Key fact : Until Coale took the Sooners to the NCAAs last spring , they had n't been to the Dance since 1995 . <p> Overview : Coale no longer has Big 12 Player of the Year Phylesha Whaley to count on , but junior Dales is an All-American in her own right . And Caufield and Hill are n't exactly chopped liver . <p> Comment : With Coale 's knack of making her team a little better each year , the Sooners could have a long Tournament run . <p> 11 . RUTGERS <p> Last season : 26-8 , lost to Tennessee in NCAA semifinals . <p> Coach : C.

Taylor and Gahan are solid threats on the wing . <p> Comment : The graduation of two-time all-conference performer Desiree Francis leaves a big hole on the ISU bench . <p> 13 . OLD DOMINION <p> Last season : 29-5 , lost to Louisiana Tech in NCAA Midwest semifinals . <p> Coach : Wendy Larry ( 358-131 overall ; 309-100 in 13 seasons at Old Dominion ) . <p> Key returnees : F/C Lucienne Berthieu , 6-2 , Sr. ; F/G Hamchetou Maiga , 6-1 , Sr. <p> Key newcomers : F/G Marianthi Koukouvinou , 6-1 , Fr. ; G/F Monique Coker , 6-1 , Fr. ; G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6-0 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Old Dominion , alma mater of Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman-Cline , was NCAA runner-up three years ago . <p> Overview : The Monarchs lost only one starter from last year and might field their best team since finishing as NCAA runner-up to Tennessee three years ago . <p> Comment : A rich blend of newcomers and veterans will make the Monarchs the team to beat in the Colonial Athletic Association and a sure bet to earn Larry 's 10th straight NCAA tourney berth . <p> 14 . FLORIDA <p> Last season : 21-13 , lost to Wisconsin in WNIT final . <p> Coach : Carol Ross ( 205-103 in 10 seasons at Florida ) . <p> Key returnees : C Naomi Mobley , 6-2 , Jr. ; C Tamara Stocks , 6-3 , Sr. <p> Key newcomers : G Ash'lea Moore , 5-3 , Fr. ; G Tara Taylor , 5-10 , Fr. ; C Vanessa Hayden , 6-4 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Sensational point guard McCain is back in the lineup after blowing out a knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobley and Stocks provide a lot of ability in the paint , and freshman Hayden will only add to what already is a formidable frontcourt . The key is the return of McCain . <p> Comment : Snubbed by the NCAA selection committee last year , the Gators , who made it to the finals of the WNIT , have something to prove in 2001 . <p> 15 . STANFORD <p> Last season : 22-11 , lost to Michigan in NCAA West first round . <p> Coach : Tara VanDerveer ( 497-142 overall ; 345-91 in 15 seasons at Stanford ) . <p> Key returnees : F/C Carolyn Moos , 6-6 , Sr. ; F Bethany Donaphin , 6-2 , Jr. ; G/F Lauren St. Clair , 6-0 , Jr . <p> Key newcomers : F/C Chelsea Trotter , 6-3 , Fr. ; F Becky Bonner , 6-2 , Fr. ; F Nicole Powell , 6-2 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Jamie Carey has been forced to give up basketball because of recurring concussions . <p> Overview : Ever since VanDerveer left to coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal in 1996 , the Cardinal has n't enjoyed its usual success . That might be about to change , even though point guard supreme Milena Flores is now playing in the WNBA . Outside of Flores , the entire starting cast returns . <p> Comment : Carey was being counted on to help lift the Cardinal to the next level , so VanDerveer will have to find another player to fill the bill - and fast . <p> 16 . NORTH CAROLINA STATE <p> Last season : 20-9 , lost to SMU in NCAA Midwest first round . <p> Coach : Kay Yow ( 569-233 overall ; 512-214 in 24 seasons at N.C. State ) . <p> Key returnees : F Monica Bates , 6-2 , Sr. ; G/F Tynesha Lewis , 5-10 , Sr. ; PG Terah James , 5-7 , So . <p> Key newcomers : G Nanna Rivers , 5-8 , Fr. ; F Adeola Olanrewaju , 6-2 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Two years ago , Yow took the Wolfpack to the Final Four for the first time . <p> Overview : Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle . But Erb is now playing for pay in the WNBA , so the Wolfpack will have to make do with sophomore center Kaayla Chones , Lewis , a pair of blue-chip freshmen and others . <p> Comment : Point guard James is expected to return at midseason , once she completes rehabbing a reconstructed knee . Her return will be much-anticipated by then . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55908 <p> While it 's hard not to notice all the peach fuzz when examining the changing face of college basketball , this year belongs to the seniors . <p> Sure , young players - extremely young players - are all the rage in the NCAA . After all , coaches have no choice but to put the ball in the hands of freshmen and sophomores and hope for the best . <p> And for many teams , those freshmen and sophomores will do very well . But when analyzing the teams entering this 2000-01 season , it 's still the seniors who are running the show . <p> Duke , with 6-8 Shane Battier , noses out Arizona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , with 6-9 Terrence Morris , edges ACC rival North Carolina , which is led by hulking 7-0 center Brendan Haywood . And defending champion Michigan State has two starting seniors in Charlie Bell and Andre Hutson . <p> Look for Battier to cap a glorious career - a four-year career - by winning the Wooden Award as the nation 's best collegiate player and by slipping a championship ring on his finger . <p> 1 . DUKE <p> Last season : 29-5 , lost to Florida in NCAA East semifinals . <p> Coach : Mike Krzyzewski ( 571-219 in 25 seasons at Duke ) . <p> Key returnees : F Shane Battier , 6-8 , Sr. ; G Jason Williams , 6-2 , So. ; G Mike Dunleavy , 6-7 , Jr. ; G Nate James , 6-6 , Sr. ; C Carlos Boozer , 6-9 , So . <p> Key newcomers : G Chris Duhon , 6-2 , Fr. ; F Andre Sweet , 6-6 , Fr . <p> Key fact : 46-2 in the ACC over the last three years . <p> Overview : Battier is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player in college ball . But guard play is the key at this level , and in Williams and James , Duke has the guards . <p> Comment : Great coaching , great leadership , great guard play . It all adds up to a Final Four trip . <p> 2 . ARIZONA <p> Last season : 27-7 , lost to Wisconsin in NCAA West second round . <p> Coach : Lute Olson ( 614-219 in 27 seasons at Arizona ) . <p> Key returnees : C Loren Woods , 7-1 , Sr. ; G Gilbert Arenas , 6-3 , So. ; G Jason Gardner , 5-10 , So. ; F Richard Jefferson , 6-7 , Jr. ; F Eugene Edgerson , 6-6 , Sr <p> Key newcomers : F Travis Hanour , 6-6 , Fr. ; F Andrew Zahn , 6-9 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Ranked in the Top 25 for 90 straight weeks . <p> Overview : After going young last year , the Wildcats will reap the benefits this season . Gardner , a Damon Stoudamire clone , and Arenas could be the best backcourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question mark , but Edgerson will provide muscle for these weaklings <p> 3 . MARYLAND <p> Last season : 25-10 , lost to UCLA in NCAA Midwest second round . <p> Coach : Gary Williams ( 424-256 overall ; 217-128 in 11 seasons at Maryland ) . <p> Key returnees : F Terence Morris , 6-9 , Sr. ; G Juan Dixon , 6-3 , Jr. ; G Steve Blake , 6-3 , So. ; C/F Lonny Baxter , 6-8 , Jr. ; F Danny Miller , 6-8 , Jr . <p> Key newcomers : Byron Mouton , G , 6-6 , Jr. ; Chris Wilcox , C , 6-10 Fr . <p> Key fact : The Terrapins have n't made a regional final since 1975 . <p> Overview : All the pieces are here . Dixon and Blake ( 217 assists ) are a dynamite backcourt , but Morris is the best player - a long slasher who can hit the boards . <p> Comment : If Morris can take on the role of go-to player , this could be the year for the Terrapins . <p> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida in the NCAA semifinals . <p> Coach : Matt Doherty ( 22-15 overall ; first season at North Carolina ) . <p> Key returnees : G Joseph Forte , 6-4 , So. ; C Brendan Haywood , 7-0 , Sr. ; F Jason Capel , 6-8 , Jr. ; F/C Kris Lang , 6-11 , Jr. ; G Ronald Curry , 6-2 , So . <p> Key newcomers : G Adam Boone , 6-2 , F ; C Neil Fingleton , 7-6 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Haywood 's 69.7 percent field-goal shooting led the nation . <p> Overview : Doherty , who was at Notre Dame last season , slips into the hot seat , and he is going to turn Forte loose this season . A tremendous clutch shooter , Forte became the first freshman in school history to lead the team in scoring . <p> Comment : Will take some lumps in the rugged ACC but eventually will jell under Dougherty 's fast-paced system <p> 5 . MICHIGAN STATE <p> Last season : 32-7 , won NCAA title . <p> Coach : Tom Izzo ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key returnees : G Charlie Bell , 6-3 , Sr. ; F Andre Hutson , 6-8 , Sr. ; F Jason Richardson , 6-6 , So. ; F Aloysius Anagonye , 6-8 , So. ; G/F Mike Chappell , 6-9 , Sr. <p> Key newcomers : F Zach Randolph , 6-9 , Fr. , G Marcus Taylor , 6-3 , Fr . <p> Key fact : Outscored opponents by 15.2 points per game last season . <p> Overview : Replacing Mateen Cleaves will be difficult , especially from a leadership standpoint , but the defending NCAA champs are still loaded . Bell will team with Taylor to form an explosive backcourt . <p> Comment : Battle-tested after last year 's magical run to the NCAA title , but the Spartans need to find a leader . <p> 6 . TENNESSEE <p> Last season : 26-7 , lost to North Carolina in NCAA South semifinals . <p> Coach : Jerry Green ( 289-202 overall ; 67-25 in five seasons at Tennessee ) . <p> Key returnees : G Tony Harris , 6-0 , Sr. ; F Vincent Yarbrough , 6-7 , Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron Slay , 6-8 , So. ; G Jon Higgins , 6-3 , So . <p> Key newcomers : F Andy Ikeakor , 6-8 , Fr. ; C Brandon Crump , 6-10 , Fr . <p> Key fact : 46-2 in the ACC over the last three years . <p> Overview : The Vols have a ton of talent , but can they get Harris and Higgins to share the ball ? The two combined for 10 3-point attempts per game , sometimes ignoring the frontcourt talent . <p> Comment : The Vols will take the next step only if Harris and Higgins volunteer the ball once in a while . <p> 7 . STANFORD <p> Last season : 27-4 , lost to North Carolina in NCAA South second round . <p> Coach : Mike Montgomery ( 442-220 overall ; 288-143 in 14 seasons at Stanford ) . <p> Key returnees : G/F Casey Jacobsen , 6-6 , So. ; F Jarron Collins , 6-10 , Sr. ; F/C Jason Collins , 6-11 , So. ; F/G Ryan Mendez , 6-7 , Sr. ; G Michael McDonald , 6-1 , Sr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fr. ; F Teyo Johnson , 6-7 . Fr . <p> Key fact : Held opponents to 35.2-percent shooting , an NCAA record low . <p> Overview : With gunners like Mendez , Jacobsen , and McDonald , the Cardinal can outshoot anyone in the country , especially from the arc . The knock against Stanford , though , has been its reputation for softness . <p> Comment : If Stanford is going to do anything , it must replace Mark Madsen 's intensity and ultra-physical play . And his 9.3 rebounds <p> 8 . KANSAS <p> Last season : 24-10 , lost to Duke in NCAA East second round . <p> Coach : Roy Williams ( 329-82 in 12 seasons at Kansas ) . <p> Key returnees : G/F Kenny Gregory , 6-5 , Sr. ; F Nick Collison , 6-9 , So. ; C Eric Chenowith , 7-1 , Sr. ; G Jeff Boschee , 6-1 , Jr. ; F/G Luke Axtell , 6-10 , Sr. ; F Drew Gooden , 6-9 , So . <p> Key newcomers : F Bryant Nash , 6-6 , Fr. ; F/G Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jayhawks were 1-10 last season when held under 70 points . <p> Overview : Unless Chenowith has turned into Bill Walton over the summer , Kansas will struggle in the postseason . While Axtell , Collison and Gooden are all versatile guys in the 6-9 to 6-10 range , they all struggle in the slowdown game . <p> Comment : Williams turned down the North Carolina job , so maybe Chenowith can pay him back by showing a pulse . <p> 9 . ILLINOIS <p> Last season : 22-10 , lost to Florida in NCAA East second round . <p> Coach : Bill Self ( 130-80 overall ; first season at Illinois ) . <p> Key returnees : G Cory Bradford , 6-3 , Jr .

Self has a potentially great backcourt in Williams , a rock-hard 205-pounder , and Bradford . <p> Comment : Self likes to use versatility to exploit mismatches , and he has plenty of raw material here to do just that . <p> 10 . CINCINNATI <p> Last season : 29-4 , lost to Tulsa in NCAA South second round . <p> Coach : Bob Huggins ( 444-158 overall ; 276-86 in 11 seasons at Cincinnati ) . <p> Key returnees : G Kenny Satterfield , 6-2 , So. ; G Steve Logan , 6-0 , Jr. ; C/F B.J.

A cupcake schedule should allow the Bearcats to jell before C-USA cranks up . <p> 11 . SETON HALL <p> Last season : 22-10 , lost to Oklahoma State in NCAA East semifinals . <p> Coach : Tommy Amaker ( 52-40 in three seasons ) . <p> Key returnees : G Darius Lane , 6-4 , Jr. ; G Ty Shine , 6-0 , Jr. ; C Samuel Dalembert , 6-11 , So. ; F Greg Morton , 6-7 , So. ; F Kevin Wilkins , 6-7 , Sr. <p> Key newcomers : F Eddie Griffin , 6-9 , Fr. ; F/G Marcus Toney-El , 6-6 , Fr . <p> Key fact : The Pirates won 10 Big East games , the most since 1993 . <p> Overview : Dalembert is back after offseason foot surgery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has laser-like quickness , emerges from Shaheen Holloway 's shadow and pairs with Lane . <p> Comment : Griffin and the continuing development of Dalembert should allow Amaker to balance his perimeter attack with some inside play . <p> 12 . FLORIDA <p> Last season : 29-8 , lost to Michigan State in NCAA championship game . <p> Coach : Billy Donovan ( 113-69 overall ; 78-49 in four seasons at Florida ) . <p> Key returnees : C Udonis Haslem , 6-7 , Jr. ; F Teddy Dupay , 5-10 , Jr. ; G Brett Nelson , 6-3 , So. ; F Brent Wright , 6-8 , Sr. ; G Justin Hamilton , 6-3 , So . <p> Key newcomers : G Orien Green , 6-5 , Fr. ; F Bonnell Colas , 6-8 , Fr . <p> Key fact : The Gators have just one player taller than 6-8 . <p> Overview : Finding someone to replace Mike Miller will be paramount for Florida . Lacking sufficient size inside , Donovan is mulling a three-guard set that would put Dupay , Nelson and Hamilton on the floor together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the Gators this year , but will that be good enough in the SEC ? <p> 13 .

Gottfried wants to fast break this year , and he has the bodies to do it . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55909 <p> BLOOMINGTON , Ind. - You have to wonder if Mike Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't just the new head basketball coach at Indiana . He 's the guy who 's following one Robert Montgomery Knight . <p> And that , as Davis is about to find out , can be an intimidating challenge . After all , the quality that made him such an attractive choice to head the Hoosiers - that he is not Bob Knight - is precisely what is going to make him a target for the many fans and alumni who adored the volatile coach . <p> It will be a hard transition , not unlike getting married and moving into a new house , only to find pictures of your new love 's ex everywhere you turn . Now multiply that by the number of fans , alumni , fellow coaches and media , and you begin to get the idea of what Davis is about to go through . <p> That dream job can quickly turn into something resembling a stretch in a penal colony . <p> " I never think about stuff like that , " Davis , 40 , said . " I just look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help this team win some basketball games . I have to look at it that way , because if you think about it ( following a legend ) , then it 's just too much added pressure . <p> " The best ( analogy ) I can come up with is Pete Myers , the guy who replaced Michael Jordan on the Bulls . You ca n't go in there and think , ' OK , this is where Michael Jordan played , and I have to be Michael Jordan . ' <p> " No , you have to go in thinking , ' I 'm the starting guard for the Chicago Bulls , and I 'm going to be myself . ' That 's the only way you can handle that situation . It 's the same with me . I have to go in there thinking , ' I 'm the head coach for Indiana , ' and that 's it . I ca n't think about anything else . " <p> Perhaps someone could have done Davis a favor by slipping him the number for the " Follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manned by the likes of Gene Bartow ( who followed John Wooden at UCLA ) , Joe B. Hall ( who succeeded Adolph Rupp at Kentucky ) , Bill Guthridge ( who followed Dean Smith at North Carolina ) and Pat Foster ( who picked up Guy Lewis ' towel at the University of Houston ) . <p> All know what it 's like to slip into the Great Man 's shoes . <p> All were successful , yet none was deemed good enough . <p> And all understand what Davis will go through this season . <p> " I ought to be the No. 1 expert on that , " said Bartow , laughing . " It was not a fun time for me when I was there ( at UCLA ) . Even though we went 27-5 , won our league ( the Pacific 8 ) by three games and got to the Final Four that first year , it still was n't that much fun . And the next year we won our league by three full games and made it to the final 16 , but again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't recommend following Bear Bryant at Alabama in football , John Wooden at UCLA in basketball , or Guy Lewis at Houston in basketball . There are n't many of them ( jobs following legendary coaches ) , but there are six or eight of them that are like that . <p> " There is no doubt I went through a lot of that at UCLA . I did n't adjust very well to it , because in my mind , we were winning so big and recruiting so well . But the nut element still would not leave our program alone . That bothered me , so I walked away . " <p> Bartow , who is retired from coaching , left after just two years , going to the University of Alabama-Birmingham . He walked away despite winning back-to-back conference titles , compiling a 51-10 record and advancing to the Final Four in 1976 , losing to eventual champion Indiana in the semifinals . <p> You also have to look at the talent he left behind - Kiki Vandeweghe , David Greenwood , Roy Hamilton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provided the impetus for Bartow 's departure . <p> A certain amount of pressure is inherent in coaching any major-college program , but imagine the proportions to which it is magnified when the previous coach was as successful as " the Wizard of Westwood " ( Wooden , who compiled 620 wins and 10 NCAA championships in 26 years at UCLA ) , " the Baron " ( Rupp , with 876 victories and four NCAA titles in 41 years at Kentucky ) , or " the Dean " ( Smith , the all-time-winningest coach with 879 victories and two championships in 36 seasons at North Carolina ) . <p> All " the General " ( Knight ) did was win 661 games and three NCAA championships ( 1976 , 1981 and 1987 ) in his 29 years in Bloomington . Indeed , Davis , who has been charged with doing a whole lot of psychic surgery on his team - and winning a few games while he 's at it - had better keep that hotline number on speed dial . <p> " It 's difficult to compare different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the winningest basketball coach of all time at the time , " said Hall , who lives in Lexington and is retired from coaching . " That was pressure . He had coached 41 years and won four NCAA championships ( 1948 , ' 49 , ' 51 and ' 58 ) . <p> " There were people in their 60s who did n't know any other coach but coach Rupp , so it was like a new beginning when I stepped in . But I was fortunate because I had been coach Rupp 's assistant for seven years , so I had a pretty good understanding of how demanding it was going to be . <p> " Let 's just say that I learned to have a thick skin . " <p> Davis will have to do likewise . Or somehow find a way to get in touch with his inner coach , because things could get intense . <p> After all , this is Indiana , baby , where phenom Damon Bailey was scouted as a junior high player . This is where Wooden - after whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is named - was born and starred in high school ( Martinsville ) and college ( Purdue ) . And this is where legends Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird honed their skills as youngsters . <p> They might not have invented basketball in Indiana , but there are a lot of folks who are certain the game was perfected here . <p> Oh , yeah . This is also where a 19-year-old received death threats after reporting the nasty encounter that finally got university president Miles Brand to drop the hammer on Knight . <p> Think folks in Indiana are just a little zealous about their basketball ? <p> But Davis , as self-assured as he is a soft-spoken , says he knows what he 's up against . He understands his every move will be under the microscope , with every success attributed to the team Knight left behind but every wrong step given the " coach Knight would n't have allowed that to happen " spin . <p> Yet he swears he is prepared , because Davis has had an up-close look at how the pressure of following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just like Bear Bryant , " said Davis , adding a soft chuckle . " I played basketball at Alabama , and Bear Bryant died my senior year ( 1983 ) . But here it is , all these years later , and they 're still comparing ( coaches ) to him , so that 's been a tough job to keep . <p> " And while this job is no different at all , I 'm not going to let myself think about it that way . " <p> Others will be more than happy to do that for him , as Foster is quick to point out . Foster doubts Davis has a true grasp of the situation in which he finds himself . <p> For reference , Foster reflects on his situation , taking over the UH program in 1986 after Lewis retired . There were n't a whole lot of victories for Lewis in those final two seasons ( 16-14 and 14-14 ) , but Foster recalls those years were quickly forgotten . <p> Under Lewis the Cougars were Hakeem Olajuwon , Elvin Hayes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball was Phi Slama Jama and " The Game of the Century , " in which Hayes outdueled UCLA 's Lew Alcindor in the 1968 epic at the Astrodome , a game that snapped a 47-game win streak for the defending champion Bruins , a team many thought unbeatable . <p> Those memories of the glory days , Foster said , are why he recalls feeling such a negative vibe after going 18-12 in his first season , which included a trip to the NCAA Tournament , and eventually putting together two 25-win teams . Foster thinks Davis is in for a similar shock , regardless of how well he does . <p> " I can tell you that he ( Davis ) does not know what he 's getting into - absolutely not , " said Foster , who is currently out of coaching . " There is no way he ( Davis ) could know . I thought I did . I did n't comprehend the magnitude of that problem at all , and that was because it was impossible to realize such a thing from the outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And believe me , that is no indictment of him at all . Look at Bill Guthridge ( at North Carolina , now retired ) . He won a whole lot of games , but it was n't even close to enough . And the way Gene Bartow was treated at UCLA - that shows you the ridiculous standards you have to meet . And there 's no way you 're going to be able to meet them . <p> " The bar has been set so high that he ca n't possibly succeed , which is why he has no chance . And that 's sad for him . They 'll probably have to go through three or four coaches in that situation up there . " <p> History seems to back up Foster 's statement . <p> Wooden was at UCLA for 26 years , but the school went through Bartow , Gary Cunningham , Larry Brown and Larry Farmer in the next seven years . Lewis put in 30 years at Houston but has since been followed by Foster ( who lasted seven seasons ) , Alvin Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just three years at North Carolina - 33 fewer than Smith - before giving way to former Tar Heel Matt Doherty . <p> Only Hall managed to stick , lasting 13 seasons at Kentucky , where he compiled a 297-100 record . Included was a 30-2 mark in 1977-78 , a season capped with a 94-88 victory over Duke in the NCAA championship game . <p> That win finally allowed Hall to put some distance between himself and Rupp . <p> " To be honest , it was both a joy and a relief , " said Hall of his only title . " I was so happy and proud for my kids and the great job that they did . I was proud of what a great team that was . That gave me a lot of satisfaction and a lot of confidence . <p> " But I also felt relief . I had achieved one of my goals , and I felt that this had taken some of the pressure off my back . I felt like I was carrying a lesser stone on my back . The stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite the burden it was before . " <p> Davis has felt the first few pebbles accumulating on his back . <p> Some in the profession openly questioned his loyalty after Davis accepted the job when Knight was canned , a fire that was fanned when Knight made no effort to contact Davis in the ensuing weeks . But Davis , who excelled at defense during his playing days at Alabama , is quick to defend his decision . <p> " When these boys said that they wanted me to stay , and their parents said they wanted me to stay , hey , I had to stay , " he said . " A couple of kids told me they were going to leave if I would have left . Where would that have put the program ? Not in a good position , that 's where . <p> " Coach Knight brought me here , and I was loyal to him when he was here . Now , I 'm remaining loyal to Indiana University . I stayed for the team . I stayed because it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is the best reason , according to Hall . <p> " I know what an opportunity it is for him , " Hall said . " It 's certainly a lot easier on a coach to step into a program that has a lot of tradition , a lot of momentum , a lot of fan support - and a program that recruits know is a great one . <p> " It 's a lot easier to step into that than a program that has bottomed out , has never had a tradition , and you 're trying to build one . I think it 's fortunate for anyone to have that opportunity . They had better be ready for it , though , because it 's going to be a jaw-shocker . " <p> Davis figures the only way to cope with the " jaw-shocking " elements is simple - do things his way . And his way differs greatly from Knight 's . <p> There will be no bombast . No chair-throwing . No player-throttling . No referee-baiting ( well , OK , perhaps a little ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And best of all , no more of those hideous red sweaters Knight seemed to wear everywhere . <p> " Hey , I have my own personality , " Davis said , laughing . " I think people will tell you that I 'm not much like coach Knight . " <p> But he will be compared to Knight . Often . Which is why most of the legacy coaches would have advised Davis to keep his sanity and let the Indiana position go to someone else . <p> " If they would talk to me before they ( accepted the job ) , I 'd say , ' Do n't do it , ' " Bartow said . " But it 's usually too late by the time I talk to them . By then I say , ' You have to try and do your job . There are pressures in all jobs , so try to have as much fun as you can . ' But fun can be hard to come by when you 're walking in those shoes .

Texas A &M; University President Ray Bowen ordered the annual tradition suspended for two years while safety improvements are studied . <p> An investigation into the cause of the Bonfire collapse cited a faulty design and an institutional myopia that overlooked warning signs of the dangers of the student-run project . <p> Calling a halt to the 90-year-old tradition is no small thing for the Aggies . The void left by the missing Bonfire - which was always lit the night before the annual A &M-University; of Texas football game - looms large on the College Station campus . <p> " I was really ready to graduate , " said senior Joseph Hammon of Arlington .

An organization of Texas A &M; students who live off-campus organized a statewide blood drive . Many others volunteered at the College Station chapter of Habitat for Humanity . <p> Habitat Executive Director Patricia Burk put the hundreds of volunteers to work .

But Metro will need a far larger sum when its sights are turned toward the far more extensive " advanced high-capacity transit system " that the agency hopes to put in place by 2025 . <p> By then , Metro officials may wish they could have hung onto the $ 1 billion in Metro funds that have been spent since 1990 for purposes other than mass transit , the agency 's primary mission . <p> Whether the eventual system is based on rail , buses or some future mode of transportation , Metro will have a tougher task , and will need to go deeper into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . <p> <p> When Metro was created by voters in 1978 , the agency was given permission to collect the 1-cent sales tax . Each year , Metro took in more money than it spent , putting some aside for future construction , including a rail line that never got on track . <p> The reserves have been drawn down about equally by two major demands - each of which has absorbed about $ 500 million during the past decade . <p> The first of these uses is described in governmental jargon as " general mobility " spending . This is money spent directly by Metro , mostly for street construction and repairs , overpasses and traffic signals within its service area . <p> While this spending certainly benefits mobility and the flow of traffic , much of it involves functions normally provided by local and state government . <p> The second major demand on Metro 's reserves came in the form of so-called " interlocal " payments . These are direct cash transfers made to Houston , Harris County and the local governments in the service area . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has freed other funds for unrelated uses , such as hiring more police . <p> The governments that receive the funds appoint the Metro board , and the mayor of Houston has power , with City Council approval , to name five of the board 's nine members . <p> The interlocal payments , once greatly popular , are now being phased out . By contrast , Metro 's general mobility spending will continue through at least 2009 under contract between Metro and its member governments . <p> This spending has widespread support - including that of Metro 's leadership . <p> Metro board Chairman Robert Miller says he thinks the general mobility projects are " a good expenditure of our funds . I believe they have been very beneficial to our region . " <p> " I think that 's one of the things that makes Metro unique , " he added . " We have a very balanced approach to mobility and transportation . " <p> Miller said the task of paying for the 7.5-mile downtown-to-Astrodome light rail line is unaffected by Metro 's general mobility spending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-capacity transit extensions to suburban areas , Miller said , if Metro can get the federal funding it needs . <p> " You can continue the general mobility program at 25 percent so long as you receive 50 percent federal funding , " Miller said . <p> <p> Metro spokeswoman Patti Muck said the agency 's reserves earn slightly more than 6 percent a year from a variety of conservative investments . <p> The raids on this piggy bank have been carried out with the approval , implicitly at least , of voters whose support for rail transit has waxed and waned over two decades . <p> And listening to the voters , lawmakers and officials across the political spectrum naturally asked whether Metro really needed so much money . <p> In 1989 , then-state Sen. Craig Washington , D-Houston , proposed spending an eighth of Metro 's sales tax revenue to house the homeless . And in 1991 , then-County Judge Jon Lindsay proposed spending one-fourth on jails . <p> In the eyes of some , Metro had long been overfunded . <p> In 1983 , voters by a 2-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through downtown and into southwest Houston . That system had a price tag of $ 2.3 billion - eight times the cost of the modest but controversial line now planned . <p> Metro was further embarrassed by having to pay nearly $ 1 million to get out of its contract to spend $ 140 million on the rail cars . <p> The fiasco led to an effort by Metro critics in 1988 to force a referendum that would cut Metro 's tax in half . The petition drive fell short , but Metro got the message . <p> To ward off future attempts on its lifeline , Metro officials agreed to a bargain embodied in a 1987 vote of its board , and then in a 1988 referendum . <p> The deal called for Metro to spend at least 25 percent of its sales tax revenue on general mobility needs . With that guarantee , voters approved a compromise funding package that provided $ 2.6 billion over 13 years . <p> The sum included funding for a 20-mile light rail system for $ 1 billion . This was considerably scaled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tracks that are separated from streets , costs more per mile than light rail and makes fewer stops . Light rail resembles an enlarged and modernized trolley system , except that cars and buses do not share right of way . <p> But even the scaled-down plan was shelved after Houston voters unseated Kathy Whitmire as mayor in 1991 and elected Bob Lanier , a rail skeptic who had chaired Metro and the state Highway Department . <p> Lanier 's victory was viewed by some as a sort of referendum on a $ 1.2 billion rail plan that Whitmire had supported . Lanier , who says the proposed system was a bad investment with inflated ridership projections , began spending Metro 's reserves on other needs . <p> Up to then , Lanier said last week , Metro had failed to honor " a political understanding " its supporters had made when the agency was created by the Legislature that it would spend 25 percent on general mobility . He said it is a " common misunderstanding " that Metro 's 25 percent obligation began with the 1988 referendum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally draining funds intended for a rail system and contended that the non-transit share of Metro spending should not exceed 25 percent in a given year . <p> Lanier said that when Metro 's revenues are compared against its spending on general mobility throughout the agency 's history , at least 75 percent has gone for transit . <p> In his mayoral campaign , Lanier argued that flight to the suburbs could be slowed , and inner-city neighborhoods improved , by rebuilding the infrastructure and making the neighborhoods safer . Under Lanier , the city drew on Metro funds to address these needs . <p> In 1992 , City Council approved hiring 655 police officers using money made available by a $ 72 million infusion from Metro - the start of the so-called interlocal payments . <p> Entering his second term , with Metro 's rail plans shelved indefinitely and rail backers fuming , Lanier 's approval rating in opinion polls soared above 80 percent . <p> Over the next eight years , the payments to cities and the county rose and fell . They peaked in 1994 at $ 101 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue that year . <p> For 2000 , they are budgeted at $ 46 million , and the payments to Houston and Harris County are scheduled to end in 2003 with the smaller cities continuing to get $ 11 million a year . <p> Metro 's general mobility spending peaked in 1993 at $ 74 million , one-third of the agency 's sales tax revenues for that year . For 2000 , general mobility spending had fallen to $ 37 million , or 11 percent of Metro 's sales tax revenues . <p> At their peak in 1994 , Metro 's combined one-year spending on general mobility and interlocal payments reached $ 267 million , or 62 cents for each sales tax dollar received , leaving 38 cents for transit . <p> Then in 1992 , for the first time in the agency 's history , Metro could not pay its bills without dipping into its reserves . The reserves shrank that year by nearly 25 percent , starting a steep decline that would bottom out in 1998 at $ 213 million . <p> In Lanier 's view , this spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an enforcement of obligations that Metro had not met . <p> " The money was accumulated largely because we did not have an agreed-on transit program and had not made the expenditures that had been contemplated for streets and roads , " Lanier says . <p> <p> From a fiscal standpoint , it may have made sense for Metro to set aside funds to earn interest until needed . But the policy was politically unrealistic . The pie was too big not to get sliced up and passed around . <p> As then-state Sen. Don Henderson , R-Houston , put it : " When the voters saw one level of government with a huge financial reserve . . . they wondered why it was not being spent for immediate relief . " <p> By contrast , Dallas Area Rapid Transit and the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority have never kept reserves as large as Metro 's . <p> DART began buying right of way for its light rail system in the mid-1980s and has continued to spend current revenues on rail and other projects . For the past several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> MARTA maintains less than $ 20 million in reserves , said spokeswoman Dee Baker . <p> " When we applied for money it was for present construction , " Baker says . " And once we got the money we started building . " <p> Baker says that when Atlanta began its rail system in 1979 , federal funding was easier to come by , and the transit agency was able to obtain an 80 percent federal share . A share of 50 percent to 60 percent is typical for large transit systems today , Baker said . <p> Metro officials decline to speculate on how far Metro might have to go into debt to build an " advanced high-capacity transit " system by 2025 . <p> However , a long-range transit plan presented to the Metro board in July by the agency 's staff says the local cost will depend greatly on two factors - federal support and whether Metro must keep paying for streets and other general mobility needs past 2009 . <p> Assuming that such a system would cost about $ 33 million per mile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of 70 to 90 miles while continuing its 25 percent general mobility obligation , the long-range plan says . <p> If general mobility spending stopped after 2009 , the plan says , Metro could build a 190-mile system . By comparison , Metro has about 90 miles of HOV lanes today . <p> But even with a demonstration light rail line running on Main Street , and freeways jammed with rush-hour commuters , such a costly system may be a hard sell . <p> Although many commuters in Fort Bend County and elsewhere may want rail , it is not clear that voters throughout Metro 's ser-vice area would approve a system that might not reach their own neighborhoods for several years . <p> Finally , federal funding is likely to remain in doubt unless Metro can mend its relations with powerful U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay , R-Sugar Land . <p> The House majority whip controls federal transit dollars for the Houston area and inserted language into the current transit appropriations bill that bars Metro from spending any federal money on rail in fiscal year 2001 . <p> DeLay has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail system and vowed to oppose any such spending without a referendum , which Metro says it must hold anyway to issue debt . <p> But regardless of what a study or vote may show , DeLay 's past comments about the cost-effectiveness of rail , compared with other forms of transit , suggest that he will be very hard to persuade . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55957 <p> There 's only one problem with Poo-Chi , the latest " hot toy " - it wo n't stop barking and flapping its ears . <p> That can be a tad annoying , especially when you 're driving down the freeway with a load of the latest in doggy toys , to be tested by a group of excited kids . <p> If you have n't heard - dogs are hot this year . <p> Not just the squirming , huggable kind , though they 're always popular , especially at Christmas . Nothing can ever really compete with that . <p> If you want the real thing you can adopt an adorable pooch at the Houston SPCA for $ 65 . SPCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Dec. 23 . Or you can go the pedigree route and spend hundreds of dollars . <p> But this Christmas , we 're talking robots and microchips . Toy technology has finally found its way into the tiniest of hands . And the yapping under your tree this year is just as likely to come from a robo-dog . <p> At least half a dozen robo-pets are available this Christmas . They do everything from roll their eyes and bark to flap their ears , pick up bones and wag their tails . <p> And guess what ? You do n't have to worry about pooper scoopers , carpet stains or chewed up shoes - though that might be next . <p> It started last April when Poo-Chi the Interactive Puppy ( Tiger Electronics , recommended for ages 4 and up , $ 24.99 ) , came on the market and sold millions . Next on the market was Tekno the Robotic Puppy ( Manley Toy Quest , recommended for ages 8 and up , $ 39.99 ) , according to Jim Silver , publisher of Toy Wishes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer their robo-dogs cuddly , there 's the furry , interactive Me and My Shadow ( MGA Entertainment , recommended for ages 3 and up , $ 59.99 . ) It 's got the softness of a plush toy with the interactive responses kids love . <p> The most recent additions are Rocket the Wonder Dog ( Fisher Price , for ages 3 and up , $ 99.99 ) and Super Poo-Chi ( Tiger , for ages 6 and up , $ 69.95 ) a deluxe version of Poo-Chi . <p> Silver recommends Rocket for kids 5 and under . And Super Poo-Chi for the over-5 crowd . It 's a tad more complicated , he says . For instance , if Super Pooh-Chi is not played with enough , his biorhythm level goes down , and he wo n't want to play . <p> Both Rocket and Super Poo-Chi were selected by Toy Wishes as two of the year 's " hot picks . " <p> Rocket has an easy-to-use control box that shows the dog 's moves , such as rolling his eyes , rocking on his tummy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headset and will respond to voice commands , but that may be too complicated for the younger set . <p> Silver compares Super Poo-Chi to a more advanced Furby , last season 's popular toy . Perhaps that 's not a coincidence - they 're both made by Tiger . <p> " The more you play with it , the smarter it gets , " Silver said . " There are eight different levels of training possible . It takes voice commands , and you can teach it how to sit , and it can do a lot of things on its own . " <p> Super Poo-Chi reacts to light , sound and touch . It crawls , stretches and protects its owner and can also sing up to 12 songs . <p> Real puppies might need to go to obedience school . But getting robo-pups like Super Pooh-Chi and Rocket to obey commands can be as simple as reading an owners manual . <p> Silver has nothing but praise for the virtual pets , which can help families overcome obstacles such as allergies and space limitations . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real thing because I 'm allergic , " he said . " A lot of kids are not that responsible , and many have allergies , like me . I ask my children , will you walk the dog at 6:30 a.m. with a pooper scooper ? I do n't think so . It 's great for kids who live in an apartment . " <p> Dave Hopkinson , a Houston marriage and family counselor , however , believes a real live lick on the face - slobber and all - is better than a contraption that does its tricks only with the help of AAA batteries . <p> " Where is the grip on reality ? " he wonders . " It ai n't real . This is not life . " <p> He also stresses that toy manufacturers ' first priority is n't to fill a family 's emotional void - it 's to sell toys . <p> " The whole point of ( selling toy dogs ) is to make a buck . We are talking about creating a need , not filling a need , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the SPCA ; they are capable of affection . The machine is not . " <p> Hogwash , replies Silver . He knows they 're just toys and , he says , they 're toys children enjoy . <p> That certainly proved true with a test group of four children ages 6 to 9 , Dylan Harris , Divya Suneja , Shannon Rushing and Fritz Gartner , who attend School of the Woods . <p> The four happily played with Rocket and Poo-Chi , as well as Blue 's Clues All Ears Blue ( Fisher-Price , for ages 2 to 5 , $ 29.99 ) . <p> All Ears Blue is an adorable little fella , sure to create enough noise to irritate any parent . <p> Press Blue 's nose and he coos . Tickle his tummy and he giggles - as much as a toy dog can . Squeeze his paw and you 'll hear the Blue 's Clues song . And his ears - well , his ears spend a lot of time " dancing " around . <p> And this dog has a few quirks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ice pop and plays the trumpet ( although its musical repertoire is extremely limited , sounding more like a party favor on New Year 's Eve ) . <p> Techno-dogs may be riding the computer wave , but that 's not to say kids ( or adults ) do n't like a plush toy now and then . <p> For some cuddly plush dogs , we checked out what 's available from Folkmanis Puppets , a company that makes finger and hand puppets in the likeness of fish and reptiles to wild and domesticated animals . <p> For this trial , however , we stuck with dogs and got a glimpse of their German shepherd ( $ 60 ) , yellow Labrador puppy ( $ 23 ) and pug ( $ 4 ) . ( They have 13 dogs from which to choose . ) <p> So realistic are the furry , large-sized puppets that they even fooled Briggs , the Jack Russell terrier puppy who posed with them in today 's picture . He much preferred chewing on their ears and showed little interest in the hairless robo-dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially drawn to Poo-Chi and Rocket . <p> " He 's cool , " said Fritz Gartner , 9 , as he played with Rocket . " He 's like a real dog to me , but he 's not as cuddly . " <p> The four tested each one . They played seriously with the robo-dogs and happily cuddled the huggable dog puppets . <p> Dylan Harris , 6 1/2 , looked up as he hugged All Ears Blue , and recommended it for 2- and 3-year olds . <p> " I saw Poo-Chi on the Today show , and if you put two of them together they fall in love , " said Dylan , a first-grader . <p> Out of the mouths of babes . <p> Fritz , Divya and Shannon dutifully placed two Poo-Chi 's nose to nose - one with pink ears and another with blue . At first , nothing happened . <p> Then the two began yapping and flapping their ears , noses glued together . <p> Dylan decided that must be Poo-Chi love . Very romantic . <p> Unfortunately there was no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had to remove their batteries to stop the public display of affection . <p> Another negative are the fragile ears , which fell off in one drop ( along with the batteries that popped out ) . <p> Rocket , however , truly may be a " Wonder Dog . " <p> " He 's scratching , he 's scratching , " Fritz shouted , as the four gathered around to watch in amazement as Rocket rolled his eyes and wagged his tail . <p> The children gave high marks to a remote control device that showed Rocket 's different tricks . Press it and he responds , doing everything from panting and barking to the tune of Old McDonald to fetching a bone and begging . The four liked his expressive face . <p> Each child took turns operating Rocket , who scored an A-plus . <p> All four would love to get Rocket for Christmas , but they would n't turn up their noses at Poo-Chi , Blue or the huge , cuddly German shepherd . <p> " Rocket is not as good as a real dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . But I would like one of those toys . " <p> Those who are appalled at the idea of virtual pets had better get used to it because there 's another on the way . Next out - a robo-parrot . <p> Polly want a cyber pet ? <p> <p> " Hot dogs " for Christmas <p> Other " hot dogs " this Christmas include : <p> I-Cybie , from Tiger Electronics , has its own personality and responds to the owner 's level of affection .

Shares of companies with power plants that sell to the California wholesale market have risen in response . <p> The lifting of the price caps means more power sales for four Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated in California . These include Reliant Energy , Dynegy , El Paso Energy Corp . and Enron Corp . <p> Reliant also owns power plants in Nevada that can sell power into the California market to capitalize on the higher prices now that the price cap has been lifted . <p> Companies such as Reliant and Dynegy got into California buying plants that the state 's large investor-owned utilities sold to comply with the law to deregulate the state 's $ 23 billion electricity market . There have not been any power plants built in California in 10 years . <p> The lack of additional generating capacity combined with growing demand is the most often cited culprit for California 's power woes . Add to that are poorly written laws that opened the state to competition . <p> The current cold snap has made a bad situation worse . <p> A key source of backup power , water-generated hydropower from the Northwest , is not being sold in California because it is needed at home because of the cold weather . <p> " We have been saying for months that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheatley , a spokesman for Reliant Energy , parent of HL &P.; Reliant , through its unregulated operations , is the third-largest nonutility power generator in California . <p> Making the situation even worse is a tightening supply of natural gas needed to burn in power plants and to heat homes . <p> One of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to California is El Paso Energy Corp . Its pipeline to California is still operating at less than full capacity . The pipeline now moves about 920 million cubic feet of gas per day ; its capacity is 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas per day . The company is still repairing its pipeline that ruptured in a fatal August explosion in New Mexico . <p> The El Paso system was named before a Senate committee Tuesday as one of the main constraints on California 's gas market by John Mazur , the acting administrator for the Energy Information Administration . <p> Mel Scott , a spokesman for El Paso Energy , said the company has been unfairly singled out for criticism . He said the lines ' customers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas from the El Paso line . <p> " We have been getting hammered over this , and we are just one of four major pipelines that serve California , " Scott said . " Our customers are taking everything we can deliver ; they physically are taking all of the natural gas they can . " <p> Other large pipelines into California are owned by Williams Cos. , PG &E; Corp . and Trans-Western . <p> Whoever is to blame , the reality is that spot natural gas prices in California have in recent days risen to the unheard-of price of $ 40 per thousand cubic feet . <p> While El Paso can not take advantage of such prices on its pipeline gas - which is sold under long-term contract - its wholesale trading arm can profit from these prices , as can wholesale trading operations at other companies . <p> Natural gas prices on the futures market , which have been hitting new records daily , dropped sharply on Tuesday on forecasts of milder weather next week . Natural gas for delivery in January to the Henry Hub closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . <p> The relatively small decline in futures prices will not spell any relief for California , which is using all of the natural gas it can get its hands on . <p> California has been struggling to keep up with growing demand for power all year . In response to soaring prices when the weather was hot , the California Independent System Operator , which oversees operation of the state 's power grid , began capping prices , first at around $ 750 per megawatt-hour , which was later decreased to $ 250 . <p> The cap was lifted earlier this week to try to lure power supplies from other states where generators can get a better price for their power . <p> The result has been wholesale electricity prices setting daily records on the California Power Exchange , the state 's main electricity market . The average price paid for electricity to be delivered Tuesday was $ 904 per megawatt-hour , up from $ 612 on Monday . <p> Shares of all of the companies that have merchant power plants in California rose this week when the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power market in California is much broader than just a quarterly increase or share price bump-up , said Bill Hyler , energy analyst with CIBC World Markets in New York . <p> With the price caps lifted , and plans to shelve an even stricter $ 150 per megawatt-hour cap that was to be implemented in January , companies will have more incentive to get into the California market , Hyler said . <p> " The ramifications of this go out for years , " Hyler said . " The consumer groups were looking for $ 100 price caps , and you ca n't make money with $ 8 to $ 10 gas with $ 100 price caps . " <p> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to weigh in this week on the decision to lift the price caps . Hyler said he expects they will support the move . <p> Removing the price caps will give companies more incentive to consider building new California power plants , Hyler said . But it 's not a quick fix . It takes about two or three years to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The long lead time for constructing new plants also means that the tight power supply situation in California can not and will not be solved overnight , even when the weather moderates in the spring . <p> This is the second time this year that the California markets have gone into a tailspin . <p> In May , an unusual heat wave pushed temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area into triple digits , causing rolling blackouts . That helped power and natural gas companies post much improved second-quarter results . <p> During the May heat wave , Dynegy 's four California plants ran more than they did in all of May and June 1999 . <p> Such results from unregulated power sales continued into the third quarter . Reliant 's wholesale energy business had third-quarter operating income of $ 319 million , up from $ 43 million in the same period last year . About $ 100 million of that profit came from the California market , Wheatley said . <p> Reliant and other power suppliers were able to provide enough power to get California through the hottest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only taken about four days of severe winter weather to cause the crisis in California . <p> <p> California power generation <p> Houston companies , in boldface , market a large share of California 's power that is not generated by utilities .

Most likely , George W. Bush will be the third president chosen with a majority of electoral votes and fewer popular votes . This undermines the authority and legitimacy of the presidency .

" <p> I 'm not recommending that Bush concede this election by the existing rules . <p> But it would be a magnanimous and statesmanlike move on his part as president to recommend the abolition of the Electoral College . <p> Steve Farmer , Angleton <p> <p> Electors have the power <p> An intellectual falsehood has been perpetrated on the American public by the Democratic " spin doctors " and the media majority concerning Al Gore 's claim to have won the popular vote and the overall relevance of it . <p> Our Electoral College electors are proportional to the population density for each of the 50 states , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting standards for its electors . <p> Most states incorporate a winner-take-all approach to electors , and therefore the winner of a state 's popular vote usually carries the state 's appointed electors to the meeting of the Electoral College . <p> The problem lies with the final popular vote counts of each of the individual states . Some states opt not to count absentee ballots if the total number of legal absentee ballots is less than the total difference between the votes separating the top two candidates . In close elections they could sway the difference . <p> The national popular vote is of little consequence to the determination of our president , as set forth in the Constitution and enacted through the Electoral College . <p> Richard L. Halferty II , Houston <p> <p> Duty of nine is chilling <p> Before this election began , the Electoral College was a subject of discussion . <p> Is it an anachronism ?

Read your history . The smaller states would n't sign the Declaration of Independence until they had " equal representation , " and with two senators for each ( in spite of population variances ) , every state was equally represented . <p> This country is an incredible and powerful " melting pot " of ideas and results . <p> We always invent or reinvent new and better ways to handle things .

Knowing he would probably lose , he filed immediately to stop any recounts . <p> All Al Gore wants ( rightfully ) is that whoever wins and becomes our next president , does so with votes - not tricks . <p> Facts are facts .

Deadline is two weeks before publication . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55940 <p> As if baseball needed to be reminded of how much trouble it 's in , the bad news has come in waves the last few days . The New York Yankees make a splash by signing Mike Mussina for $ 88.5 million over six years . The Colorado Rockies get Denny Neagle for $ 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Mets snag Kevin Appier for $ 42 million . <p> And then , playing a remarkable game of who-can-top-this , Texas and Boston handed out the two largest contracts in history a few hours apart on Monday . Superstar shortstop Alex Rodriguez joined the Rangers for $ 252 million over 10 years , and almost before the ink was dry , slugging outfielder Manny Ramirez signed with the Red Sox for $ 160 million over eight years . <p> Those six contracts totaled $ 714.5 million and sent a clear signal to Derek Jeter , Jeff Bagwell , Jason Giambi , Mark McGwire , Sammy Sosa , Mariano Rivera and other members of the free agent class of 2001 . That message : Life is good for baseball 's best players . <p> Meanwhile , the cash-strapped Oakland Athletics were forced to trade right fielder Matt Stairs and second baseman Randy Velarde to trim their payroll . And they watched from the sidelines as their second-best starting pitcher , Appier , departed for the Big Apple . <p> Appier resurrected his career during a season and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League West last season . He was so well liked in his own clubhouse that when A 's general manager Billy Beane heard what the Mets had offered , he simply offered his congratulations . <p> So it goes . While a shrinking number of major league teams get richer and richer , those at the lower end of the food chain struggle to survive . On the other side of town , Montreal , Minnesota , Kansas City , Florida and others never gave Rodriguez a second thought . <p> Now , four months before opening day , at least half the teams in the majors have virtually no chance of making the playoffs . Barring a dramatic upset - and the A 's pulled one in winning their division last summer - the 2001 playoffs will again be dominated by the Yankees , Mets , Braves and maybe the Rangers or Rockies . <p> Forget suspense . Fans who cheer for the small-market franchises know their teams have no chance of competing . So why should they go the ballpark ? To watch the hometown team develop a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then watch him go somewhere else once he 's eligible for salary arbitration or free agency ? <p> " I 've got a season-ticket application on my desk at my home for a particular club , and I 've got to pay my eight grand , " said Sandy Alderson , an executive vice present with Major League Baseball and a former general manager of the A 's . " There are a lot of season-ticket holders thinking the same thing . This is the kind of thing that causes people to say , ' Gee , what am I buying ? Is this a ticket to the movies ? Is this a ticket to an Athletes in Action game ? Is this a competition ? Do we really have a shot here ? ' It raises a lot of issues . <p> " Baseball has a right to survive in a form in which there is competition among as many teams as possible . We 're losing that . For every Texas , there are five teams that have to trade their second baseman or starting right fielder because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players on teams like that if the game is as healthy as this signing might suggest to some . " <p> Alderson may be the second-most powerful man in baseball , behind only to commissioner Bud Selig . He 's a graduate of Harvard Law School and a former Marine , and his influence inside the game is not to be underestimated . <p> When he made himself available to reporters after the Rangers announced Rodriguez 's signing , he probably was firing the latest shots in what figures to be the mother of all labor battles next winter . <p> Selig hopes to convince owners to drastically change the way they do business with one another by asking the richer teams to share substantially more of their revenues with the poorer teams . <p> Colorado owner Jerry McMorris said about 90 percent of the game 's owners agree that more revenue sharing is needed . Problem is , the owners who will be hurt by such a plan - George Steinbrenner , Ted Turner , Peter Angelos and others - could not be more opposed to sharing their profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If Selig somehow convinces his colleagues to divy up their profits - and that 's a long shot - he 'll have the ammunition he needs to ask for player concessions when the current labor agreement expires after next season . It 's unclear what the owners intend to ask for , but some favor a salary cap similar to what the NBA and NFL now have . At the very least , the players will be asked to accept some sort of drag on salaries . <p> Players have resisted such demands in the past , and in the end , the owners always backed down . However , this time the owners seem adamant about shutting the game down as long as it takes to get the players to agree to changes . <p> Since the 1994-95 strike , no team not in the top 10 in payroll has made the World Series . This year 's World Series featured the Yankees and Mets - the No. 1 and 5 spenders last season . <p> Since that most recent work stoppage , salaries have increased by 86 percent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams have prospered thanks to new ballparks and soaring local broadcast revenues , others have all but given up hope . <p> " We 've got a player compensation system that 's out of whack , " San Diego Padres president Larry Lucchino said . <p> In the wake of Rodriguez 's signing , owners were even publicly fighting among themselves . Mariners chief executive officer Howard Lincoln , perhaps stung over losing Rodriguez to the Rangers , called Rangers owner Tom Hicks a " fool " for agreeing to the deal . <p> " ( Alex ) is the guy who said he wanted to play on a winning team and that he loved Seattle , " Lincoln told the Seattle Times . " Why did he sign with Texas ? Obviously , some fool stepped out of the woodwork to pay him so much he could n't refuse it . The offer from Texas was far and above what the Mariners or any sane person would offer . " <p> Reds chief operating officer John Allen told the Cincinnati Enquirer : " To say I 'm shocked is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans would get a mixed signal . We ( teams ) are sitting here as a group saying we 're losing money and have to get ( equality ) . Then we turn around and do things individually that do n't portray the picture we 're painting . " <p> Allen seems to have forgotten that until a few days ago it was his Reds who 'd handed out the biggest contract in history . That occurred last winter when they wanted to make a splash and thus traded for Ken Griffey Jr . and signed him to an eight-year , $ 116.5 million contract . <p> Others have trouble believing the owners . After all , they 've heard them voice similar concerns for three decades . <p> " I was asked about payroll disparity in 1988 and the people asking it were writers from Atlanta , Seattle , Texas , Baltimore and Cleveland , " agent Scott Boras said . " All of a sudden the have-nots are the haves . It has a lot more to do with management . The franchises that were in the bottom seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven or eight . The cities have n't changed . Nothing has changed other than good business decisions are being made now . Our major issue in baseball in the ' 80s and ' 90s was the ' pie ' itself . Now the pie is grand and the question is , ' How do we distribute it ? ' That 's not such a bad question . " <p> Hicks said the Rodriguez deal makes sense for the Rangers . He insists the team will be profitable in 2001 . <p> " It makes it very tough to compete for the smaller-market clubs when this is happening , " Padres general manager Kevin Towers said . " It 's good for the Texas Rangers , but it 's bad for baseball . " <p> There 's a ripple effect . After the Red Sox failed to land either Mussina or Hampton , they went hard for Ramirez . <p> The Indians , who offered $ 119 million over seven years last month , went to $ 135 million over eight years during the final round of talks . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing ticket prices , had the final say . <p> " There was no more money for us to give , " Indians general manager John Hart said . " We 've sharpened our pencil as sharp as it can go . We 've got nothing to blink about or apologize for . We went out big for Manny . We went out a lot further than I thought we could . What more can you do ? Boston was n't going to let it stop . " <p> Small-market general managers must have laughed at hearing how two of the game 's giants went head-to-head for a player they could only imagine bidding for . Maybe Hart lost Ramirez to the Red Sox , but he 's still got a stadium that will be full for 81 games and a franchise that is the envy of many . <p> " We 're just spectators in all of this , " said Oakland 's Beane . " I would be less than honest if I said I was n't a little bit in awe . We do n't get into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our organization is not subject to the goings-on in the marketplace . We 're the A 's . It does n't work that way for us .

At his deathbed , Tom Hsu , his great nephew , was instructed of his simple wishes . Tom Hsu , the only relative in Houston , said they had never felt close to each other . <p> " He asked for his body to be cremated with no memorial ceremony and his artwork auctioned to help ' the elderly , infirm , women and children . ' For Chinese , it 's a taboo to talk about death or a will when one is alive , " said Tom Hsu , a former computer technician who currently studies at Dallas Theological Seminary . <p> " It 's a loss to the Houston art world . This auction is what I can do to honor him and his wish , " said artist Chi Wang , owner of the gallery who organized the auction . <p> Visitors were awed by the more than a dozen large-size scrolls and framed paintings - splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested a fusion of Eastern and Western art traditions . <p> His manipulation of the brush , strength of strokes and composition of linear elements reflected his solid foundation in the genre of Chinese traditional ink-painting , critics said . His use of dazzling colors , shadings and depth dimension evidenced his mastery in Western techniques that developed his own " impressionistic " expression . <p> " I have never met Mr. Hsu . But the moment I saw his paintings , I knew his inner world . He was steeped in his craft . I wish I had known him earlier , " said Xianrang Yong , a renowned Chinese artist who relocated to Stafford eight years ago . <p> " He had been looking for what is beautiful in life and wanted to show it to the world . But he is a loner , as the path of a true artist seeking to be understood is lonely . This is a path we as artists are all walking , " he said . <p> The splendor on the rice paper was nevertheless tainted by the recollection of Hsu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek artistic recognition in America . <p> " Mr. Hsu had long toiled in his artistic journey after he came to America , " said Wang , who became his friend soon after Hsu arrived in Washington , D.C. , in the early 1970s . <p> Wang said selling art was tough for Hsu , who spoke limited English and mainly communicated with his Western viewers through the visual language of traditional Chinese freehand brushwork . <p> " He could n't stand the pressure and had to allow his art to walk to the street , " she said of Hsu 's later style that was changed to suite popular taste . <p> Hsu moved to New York City and to Miami , Fla. , before relocating to Houston . Throughout his life in America , he tried to make a living instructing and selling his art . <p> He had remained single after his divorce in New York two decades ago . His ex-wife was said to grow tired of an indigent life with a roaming and struggling artist , according to Alief resident Chimao Li , 76 . Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air force technical school in China . <p> In Houston , friends said he would often drive his rusty 1982 Chevrolet Suburban , sometimes for hours to outside Houston , to festivals or shows to sell his paintings . <p> " I rarely saw anybody stop by his booths , " said Chao-Han Suen , co-president of Chinese Seniors Association of Houston , recalling seeing Hsu at an Asian festival in Hermann Park and a Chinese festival sponsored by Clear Lake High School . <p> Friends said he lived on his $ 512-per-month supplementary Social Security income provided some elderly after reaching age 65 , eventually with the benefit of Medicaid and Medicare that relieved him of the long pain of being uninsured . <p> Since 1987 , he had made home at Brays Village Apartments , a government subsidized housing facility in Alief . Julie Nguyen , the complex 's leasing consultant , said his artwork was scattered throughout the apartment where the only furniture he had , all old and worn out , were a bed , a small dresser , a recliner , a couple of chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a make-shift " table " he set up using a large piece of board at which he painted . <p> T.P. Chang , co-president of Chinese Seniors Association of Houston who had known Hsu for 18 years , said Hsu did not have a television nor a camera until he was 60 . <p> " He was a proud man , never showed he had financial difficulty . On the contrary , he was generous and strong-willed , " Chang said . <p> He was diagnosed with gastric cancer in 1997 and had two surgeries afterwards , according to his doctor , Shengkun Yao of Allcare Medical Center in Alief . <p> After a car accident in which he was injured , he opted for biking as a chief means of transportation . Later , another accident in which he was struck by a car while biking landed him in the hospital with a broken leg . <p> " He was quiet and private , and seldom had visitors , " said neighbor Anh Thong Truong , 74 , recalling he had to persuade Hsu hard to let Truong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Truong , a Chinese-Vietnamese immigrant , organized a garage sale of Hsu 's furniture and personal belongings to help offset his outstanding business balances , including his cremation that cost almost $ 2,000 . <p> Members of a local senior organization to which Truong belongs and Hsu used to belong donated about $ 80 for Hsu 's posthumous expenses . <p> Hsu 's bank savings totaled a little more than $ 1,000 when he died , said his great nephew . <p> About one month before he died , he received provider service that arranged for a worker to clean his place and help with errands-running for a few hours everyday . <p> " This was far from sufficient for a sick old man who had to live by himself most of the time , " said Truong , who recalled seeing Hsu laying on the floor one night when he called on him . <p> " I opened the door and saw he had been on the floor for a long time after he fell and was not able to get up . Even so , he refused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truong . <p> Hsu broke his leg another time when he fell from his make-shift table as he stood there trying to fetch something from the wall , said Truong . <p> Shortly before he died , Hsu received visits from Mandarin-speaking social worker Melody Lin Ma with Ultra Home Health and Hospice , a local agency , as part of the home health care provided him . <p> Ma recommended hospice to Hsu , an idea again rejected by him . <p> " It ( hospice ) is a radical concept to a lot of people of Asian decent . They did n't think this wonderful American system would fail them , " said Ma . " Many clients chose defense mechanism . Some died fighting . Many elderly know in their hearts what they are facing . Hsu was very lonely during his last month . " <p> Born in 1923 , Hsu started his training in art at age 14 with Yi-hsuan Shao , a master in Chinese traditional ink-painting . He relocated to Taiwan in 1949 when communists took over China and subsequently worked with the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night though working as a public functionary by day and soon became a figure of high regard in the arts circle in Taiwan . Over the years , he exhibited his work at dozens of recognized art galleries in Taiwan , Japan and America . <p> " He had a house with an elegant garden that had a pond and lived a successful life in Taiwan by Taiwanese standards . I think it was a mistake for him to leave Taiwan , " said Li , whom Hsu deemed as a close friend . <p> " He saw America as a land of new opportunity . But no one really knew how lonely he was . I 'm the only person he confided his inner feeling with . " <p> Li said Hsu cried on the phone one day when he called to let Li know he had just talked with his sister-in-law who called from China to ask about Hsu 's life in Houston . <p> Ma said it may be one-sided to view Hsu 's immigrant life in the negative light , and so agreed a University of Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants shortly before he died . <p> " He struck me as a person with a free spirit and who had traveled far with a lot of accomplishments . Life had been a very rich journey by his standards . He had no regrets , " said Ma . <p> " This is the beauty of this country . You do n't have to live a traditional life . You can live an independent life , choose to have as less social contacts as possible to the very end . " <p> The UH student , who asked not to be identified because of the confidential nature of her study , said though it took two days to finish the interview because of the subject 's physical fatigue , Hsu expressed a sense of fulfillment in his life . <p> " He appeared sick , weak and alone .

He repeatedly said he lived a life he wanted , " she said . <p> " His sudden departure speaks of impermanence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cultural Office in Houston .

" <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55949 <p> THE prospect of fixing White Oak Bayou 's upstream flooding problems via a large drainage channel cutting through the Heights is growing unlikely after area residents expressed deep concern about the proposal . <p> The Harris County Flood Control District held two public meetings late last month to solicit comment on a series of ideas to prevent White Oak flooding . The plans will eventually be packaged into a comprehensive proposal to the federal government for the White Oak Bayou Federal Flood Control Project . The project will be co-funded by the federal government . <p> One idea was to build a 200-foot right-of-way drainage channel , which would have followed the abandoned Katy/MKT railroad tracks along 7th Street , crossed East 6th near Oxford and flowed back into White Oak Bayou near Stude Park . <p> Burton Johnson , project manager for Harris County Flood Control , said he was not surprised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people being alarmed , " he said , " and we 're trying to tell them not to be alarmed as it 's something we do n't anticipate recommending . " <p> The reason for proposing the idea in the first place , Johnson said , has to do with the district 's responsibility to explore all technically feasible options , with an eye towards the greatest flood control and cost efficiency , then marrying those plans with what people want . Complicating that effort is the fact that the project is federally co-funded . <p> " The way it works is we have to find what the federal government considers the most economically efficient plan , " Johnson said . " There is a cost-sharing equation that determines how much the local sponsor - that 's Harris County Flood Control - would pay , and how much the federal government would pay . <p> " So we 're obligated to identify the most efficient plan , and it 's possible that we might identify features that no one wants and that we know no one wants . We 're obligated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that concerns would probably be raised , and sure enough they were . " <p> Houston Heights Association President Allan Tiller , when he learned of the plan , claimed it would present a severe challenge to the neighborhood . <p> " Can you imagine a large ditch going straight through the center of the Heights , or at least the southern part ? " he said . " It would just cleave the neighborhood in two . It would be terrible . " <p> That sentiment was echoed by Heights area residents who attended the two meetings , held Nov. 29 at St. Matthew 's Catholic Church on Hollister and Nov. 30 at Scarborough High School . <p> While admitting the plan does not seem to be meeting the " public desirability " test , Johnson said it does solve a host of factors related to alleviated flooding along White Oak Bayou further upstream . This would especially hold true around the Antoine area , which is why the idea was advanced in the first place . <p> " Of course , we look at where the worst flooding usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " The large White Oak channel with the concrete in it ( near Stude Park ) was constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the early 1960s and 1970s . Because of that project , there is not a whole lot of flood damage downstream . That 's why we 're focusing on upstream . Obviously , where we have the most flood damage is where we justify spending the most money . " <p> Hence the plan to speed the flow of water in the Heights area . Complicating that flow , according to Johnson , are the railroad trestles from the Katy/MKT line that cross White Oak Bayou near Studewood . <p> " A lot of the trouble can be alleviated by just ripping out a problem , meaning those railroad trestles , which serve as dams , " he said . " Though of course , we 're really going to be replacing them eventually because that 's where the bike trail is going to be . " <p> He was referring to the Katy/Nicholson Rails to Trails Project , a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert the old Southern Pacific railroad beds along Nicholson as well as the Katy/MKT line into hike and bike trails . That effort is scheduled to begin by 2002 . <p> Johnson said that the plan for the drainage channel along the Katy/MKT presents other problems in addition to a lack of public support . <p> " First , it 's just too tight in there , " he said . " When we first started looking at it , it was a much smaller idea , then it got larger and took on a life of its own . Eventually , we were looking at 200 feet of right-of-way , and we would have some of the nice features like a bike trail . But it would entail acquiring a number of residences , and that would cause some concerns . " <p> Hence , Johnson said that the idea that looks good on a flood control chart appears to be headed to the scrap bin . <p> " It 's very low on the likely scale , " he said , " and the only way for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are expressing concerns to call us back and start begging us to build it . That 's how I perceive it at least . And from the gauge we got at the meetings this time , that 's unlikely , I 'd say . <p> " We 'd only go ahead and recommend it if the city of Houston was supportive of the plan and if the local community in that area had a general acceptance of it . We did n't have a vote , but you get the flavor of it . That 's why we have the meetings .

This was the most significant step in a 10-year effort led in part by the nonprofit Heights Community Development Corporation . <p> The re-opening in July , after a three-year absence , of a Houston Police Storefront in the Heights , at 910 North Durham , Ste. D. <p> Central among neighborhood leaders ' concern this year has been the maintenance of what they call the Heights area 's historic character in the face of a rush of inner city development . This building spate has transformed large swaths of the Montrose and West End . Gone are predominantly bungalow communities with large , older trees and generous lawns . In their places stand large , three- and four-story townhomes that stretch from lotline to lotline and are much closer to the street . <p> Such a vision is anathema to Heights neighborhoods , where the main story of development since the late-1970s has been one of renovation of Victorian , Queen Anne and bungalow homes built at the turn of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a crime-ridden , transient community into one of stable affluence . The wave is at the core of the Houston Heights Association 's oft-stated vision of the neighborhood as " a small town in the heart of the big city . " <p> For the Heights Association , the process to preserve the neighborhood has focused primarily on builder education , though at times the group has resorted to more confrontational tools such as picketing , with some positive results . <p> In the early spring , picketing eventually brought on design changes to a townhome project on Heights Boulevard that allowed the project to stay more in line with the area 's dominant bungalow architecture . <p> " It 's a continuing process of trying to educate builders and developers , " said Tiller , " to have construction in a manner that 's consistent with the character of the Heights and discourage townhome construction . <p> " The most disappointing thing this year is the construction of townhouse projects . There 's been a couple that have been built . There 's also been the demolition of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . " <p> In October , the Heights Association finished a set of revisions to the neighborhood 's deed restrictions , which cover approximately one-third of the Houston Heights . The revisions are aimed at specifically preventing townhome construction . <p> " We did that , but we have not presented them to the property owners for approval yet , " said Tiller . " We 'll do that at the beginning of next year . " <p> A primary tool in the preservation battle , said Tiller , would be historic district designation . Todd Murphy , who led Norhill 's designation drive , said that the protections afforded his neighborhood , which he estimates as 90 percent bungalow style , have been a boon to preservation . <p> " It was just before Thanksgiving last year when we submitted the completed application to the city , so technically , we 've had the protection of the ordinance for a year now , " he said . " There 's a lot of people in the neighborhood who are very happy with the project coming to a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been getting the historic street signs up , we 've been getting a lot of compliments on how nice they look and what a nice thing it is for the neighborhood . It 's eased the concerns of neighbors who fear historically inappropriate development . " <p> In Norhill as well as most of the Woodland Heights to the south , protection was already provided by a very detailed set of deed restrictions . In the Houston Heights , most residences are not deed restricted , and thus the neighborhood is more open to the threat of historically inappropriate development . However , Murphy added that deed restrictions are important , but they do n't have the same force of a city ordinance . <p> Still , both Tiller and Murphy are emphatic in saying that no one is trying to force anyone 's idea of a historic vision down anyone 's throats . Rather , the focus is on developing a shared sense of the importance of maintaining the historic nature of the greater Heights area , meaning both with residents and builders , most of whom come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped that out immensely . <p> " The designation has raised the consciousness , so to speak , of what is or is n't historic and why this is important to preserving our homes , " he said . " It 's crucial . " <p> Tiller agreed . <p> " Even beyond the specific objectives like designation , the main thing is to raise the consciousness of the development community as to what a unique place the Heights is , " he said , " meaning do n't kill the goose that laid the golden eggs . We want to raise the level of awareness and sensitivity and appreciation of what the Heights is . A historic designation campaign , hopefully , will again raise that level of appreciation and awareness . " <p> One of the problems in pursuing historic district designation now , both Tiller and Murphy admit , is that in late 1999 , the city started a process to revise the ordinance . Murphy said this turned the effort into a sort of " moving target " that complicated the process . <p> " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we were able to get through , " Murphy said . " Still , it almost did n't get done because of the ordinance changes . That was the big bone of contention in the last days . " <p> This state of flux in the designation process led the Woodland Heights Civic Association in September to put on hold their efforts to obtain historic district status . <p> " After it becomes clear what the ordinance is after any amendments , the WHCA will then assess the viability of restarting efforts to pursue Historic Designation , " WHCA President Ivon DuPont wrote in an e-mail circulated in September via the civic club 's public message lists . <p> As far as the Houston Heights is concerned , historic district designation would be a far more complicated effort than what faced the Proctor Plaza Civic Association and/or what might lie ahead for the Woodland Heights . The reason is sheer size . East and North Norhill , according to Murphy , encompasses some 886 properties . The Houston Heights , according to Tiller , has more than 5,000 . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pursuing designation , though it remains a priority . <p> " First , I 'd like to complete the deed restriction option , " he said , " or at least be a lot further along as far as consideration of historic district designation . It would take 67 percent support of the neighborhood , and in order to do that we 'd have to write our own standards that would be acceptable on a broad basis . It 's possible that we 'd have to pursue it piece meal , on a section by section basis , which is not a pleasant option to consider . " <p> Of course , historic preservation is not the only thing on area leaders ' plate for 2001 . Coming up in February , the city of Houston will receive a preliminary engineering report regarding street construction plans for Studewood . <p> " The Preliminary Engineering Report will produce the data necessary to make a decision about whether Studewood should be 3-4 lanes , etc . " District H Councilmember Gabriel Vasquez wrote in an e-mail distributed to area civic club leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will call a meeting of civic club leaders to review the data and make final recommendations on the reconstruction of Studewood . " <p> Tiller said the Heights Association is waiting to see what the final recommendations are , but that the association is opposing any plans to widen the street . " We want to maintain the constant liaison with the city on issues that are important to us , such as revisions to Chapter 42 ( the city 's development ordinance ) , revisions to the historic designation ordinance and the like , " he said . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55954 <p> Library to offer Microsoft course <p> Staff at Fort Bend County Libraries ' Mamie George Branch , 320 Dulles Ave. , will present " Microsoft Excel Survival Basics " Monday , beginning at 7 p.m .

Mobley 's casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to a teammate for his intentions to become clear , before bouncing into the high-dollar seats at General Motors Place . <p> Rudy Tomjanovich 's face turned several shades of red as he shouted out a critique that included at least two printable words . Minutes later , Kenny Thomas tried a shot that seemed suitable only for H-O-R-S-E and Tomjanovich looked as if he was trying to swallow a watermelon whole . <p> Emotions escalated , calmed and soared again and again . Tomjanovich wore out shoe leather like an expectant father . He shouted his throat raw , lived and died with every moment . And when Mobley sealed a victory over the Grizzlies with a strong drive and nifty scoop , Tomjanovich let out a shout and punched the air , still unwilling to diminish any game as just a Monday night in Vancouver . <p> With the win , Tomjanovich will go into Thursday 's game at Golden State one victory from 400 in a coaching career that began with him wondering if he would reach 40 . <p> But even after 399 victories and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been energized , revitalized . Instead of reaching the milestone in a limp , Tomjanovich is one year from a career crossroads having made the turn and picked up speed . <p> " He 's more exuberant , " Rockets forward Matt Bullard said . " He seems to have relaxed a little bit . He 's not as stressed as he used to be . He still demands the work ethic and professionalism he always has . But he 's really doing a great job coaching the young guys , letting them play , but learning the right way . I think it 's re-energized him . " <p> Bringing a young team into maturity , he might not seem anything but calm . But as Tomjanovich reaches a milestone he did not know was approaching , he said he feels more sensible , more balanced . <p> " I used to be really crazy , " he said , seeming unaware that for two hours , 82 nights a year his sanity seems just one more bad pass or botched play from lost . " I was crazier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He no longer lies awake at night , torturing himself with thoughts of what he could have done differently . He no longer obsesses over details he can not control , no longer pushes himself past exhaustion . <p> Tomjanovich , 52 , often had said he became a head coach with no expectations to stick around long enough to click off victory milestones by the 100s . Even after the championships in 1994 and 1995 , Tomjanovich was not sure if he would make himself a coaching " lifer . " <p> He might have discovered he was hooked in the following seasons . But it was not until he ran himself into collapse , hitting that wall hard enough to need a hospital visit and a doctor-ordered break , that he said he knew he could and would keep guiding the Rockets through their next generation . <p> " It knocked me down , " Tomjanovich said . " I started living better , taking care of myself better . It started a couple years ago . I 'm still learning lessons , psychological lessons all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . I do n't have that kind of power . No person does . There 's times you think you 're Mr. Fix-it . But you can only do your best and that 's enough . <p> " At times , I just kept grinding and grinding . But there 's only so many things I can affect . It 's an internal thing , when I 'm away from the game , how I treat myself . You can do it in your sleep and I have , problem-solving and trying to come up with a great solution . You wear yourself out and you make it harder to find the solution . " <p> The irony of Tomjanovich 's exhaustion was that it led to his first acceptance that he would want to remain coaching for years to come . It was as if he could not imagine pushing himself as he had been , and perhaps could not . <p> But when he forced himself to ease back on the emotional throttle , he also accepted he could continue coaching . <p> " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ( in July 1999 ) , " Tomjanovich said . " I just said , ' I love this , but I 'm doing it the wrong way . ' " <p> Still , with a team built around young , inexperienced players , his latest charges would seem more need of his attention . There are more details to address , more rough edges to smooth . <p> Instead , despite the nightly outbursts , those close to Tomjanovich believe he has relished the different mission that has come with a different team . <p> " He 's energized and excited , " said Jesse Brown , Tomjanovich 's friend and business manager for 30 years . " When he was over there with that team of All-Stars in Sydney , even if things were good or bad , he would say , ' I ca n't wait to get back to my guys . ' He would tell people from the international scene , ' I 'm excited about my team . ' " <p> The other difference from the " crazier " years is he has since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tomjanovich has not had to worry about job security . He is in the last season of the five-year , $ 25 million contract he signed after the first championship . But even with more than a year to go , he agreed to a four-year extension that begins next season . <p> But even if he has n't had to worry about keeping his job , Tomjanovich said it was more important he has been able to coach without second-guessing himself , that despite the raw emotions of the games , he can bring his team along with patience and perspective . <p> " When you 're young like I was , a new coach , you 're always trying to look for your self-worth , " Tomjanovich said . " ' Can I do this job ? Is my approach a winning approach ? ' That 's the question every coach asks himself . It 's brutal . I 'm just learning to deal with it . <p> " You 've got to go through the experiences to get there . You 've got to go through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're putting together an army , you do n't expect them to show up and know how to win . They have to go through some things out there . We 're in that process right now . " <p> Even if he did n't know his record , it would seem enough reason to no longer question himself as he once did . With his next win , Tomjanovich will become the 29th coach to reach 400 . His winning percentage of 59.1 ranks 12th all-time . <p> If he continues at his career pace of 48 wins per season for this season and his next contract , Tomjanovich would have 629 wins , a figure that would currently rank 15th . The next coach Chuck Daly , won 638 games and is in the Hall of Fame . <p> " Looking back , that 's pretty amazing , " Bullard said . " I remember when they fired Don ( Chaney ) , they talked to Rudy and ( Carroll Dawson ) . They did n't want to do it . Four hundred wins later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not worried about coaching milestones or proving himself . <p> " I just try to have fun , " he said . " It 's not even a basketball deal . I take each day as it comes and try to get something good out of it . I feel very fortunate and grateful to be doing something I love .

But scientific types know it 's made by coagulating milk to form lactic curds , and through minute variations , different characteristics are formed during the process . <p> Food historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in 42 B.C. : " Rest with me on green foliage : We have ripe fruit , soft chestnuts and plenty of fresh cheese . " But cheese goes back even further in history , with writings from the ancient Sumerians about more than a dozen soft cheeses around 3,000 B.C. Meanwhile , others claimed cheese was discovered around 10,000 B.C. when sheep and goat herders stumbled on sour milk that had naturally separated into curds and whey . The curious herders proceeded to drain the whey , then shape and dry the curds into simple cheese . <p> The origin of cheese may always be an enigma to food historians , but it does n't require research to figure out why people love to eat it . <p> " It 's the taste ; it 's the texture ; it 's the body and aroma ; it 's all those things that make cheese wonderful , " said Paula Lambert , the Dallas mozzarella cheesemaker who wrote " The Cheese Lover 's Cookbook and Guide " ( Simon &; Schuster , $ 35 ) . " You can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor from that little bitty bite . " <p> Flavor is what eating is all about , and more Americans are starting to take note . Cheese consumption steadily grew an average of 1.5 pounds per person from 1989 to 1999 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . This translates to each person consuming about 30 pounds of cheese in 1999 , up 7 pounds from 1989 . <p> " It 's a happening thing - cheeses , " said Laura Werlin , author of The New American Cheese ( Stewart , Tabori &; Chang , $ 35 ) . <p> Cheese is spreading across America . This is most obvious in the marketplace , where smart restaurants are offering cheese courses and cheese carts . Inspired by the acceptance of imported cheeses , as well as by the rise of domestic artisan cheese producers , restaurants such as Picholine in Manhattan , Everest in Chicago and Campanile in Los Angeles are increasingly offering cheese courses . <p> In Houston , Chez Georges on Westheimer rolls out a cheese cart with more than a dozen choices at dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as does Tony Ruppe 's and Aries on Montrose . <p> For the cheese industry , these are exciting times , especially for American artisan cheese makers . Cheesemonger Werlin compares what 's happening to cheese to the American wine movement in the 1970s , when consumers started to take an interest in California wines . <p> " For the most part , it 's true that we as Americans do n't know what to do with cheese other than putting it on a cracker and call it a snack . But slowly , people are taking that concept and turning it into something more elegant , " she said . <p> People are waking up to cheese , slowly discovering that the animal 's milk ; weather ; season ; and invisible , airborne microbes can give this simple piece of solid milk the variety of the world . France alone offers more than 400 different cheeses , including brie , Port-Salut , Morbier and Roquefort . <p> Travel south to Spain , and you 'll find the aromatic Manchego , or hop over to Italy for the robust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorize . But then there 's no need . Simply try different ones and make mental notes of ones you like . Be adventurous , and along the way , try different ways of serving cheese . Crackers are nice , but hot crusty French bread can be better . Fresh fruits are wonderful with cheese , too . But in addition to grapes and apples , try figs , apricots and peaches . The point is to experiment and stretch the boundaries . <p> Lindy Rydman and daughter Lisa Rydman-Key enjoy cooking with cheese , and as co-owners of Spec 's , they have about 400 cheeses to choose from . They 've discovered that baked chicken breasts stuffed with goat cheese make for a savory entree . For a party appetizer , they coat a roll of goat cheese with walnuts , put it under the broiler for a second or two , and serve it on a bed of pureed frozen raspberries .

<p> Rage Against the Machine , the first group I covered live at Compaq Center , is now without a lead singer . Local divas Destiny 's Child changed personnel twice and still became the hottest female R &B; group in the world . <p> Emotional Houston Rockers Blue October kick-started their careers with a major-label debut , " Consent to Treatment . " <p> All five teen sensations - the Backstreet Boys , ' N Sync , 98 Degrees , Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera - played Houston on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilots resuscitated its Houston fan base with an electric comeback concert in June . <p> On the other end of the career spectrum , veteran rockers the Smashing Pumpkins called it quits just days after playing Aerial Theater in May . <p> The legendary Tina Turner enjoyed playing her final Houston show so much in April that she decided to do it again in October . No word on if she 'll have a third retirement party here next year . <p> A.D. 2000 was the year of Eminem , Britney , ' N Sync , Limp Bizkit and the legality of Napster . Many of the biggest events of the year passed through Houston at the height of hype or controversy , including us in new-millennium pop culture . <p> In some cases - Destiny 's Child 's uber-success , rocker Ted Nugent 's ban from playing the Woodlands Pavilion and the national music news was born here . <p> Awe- and ear-inspiring concerts stopped in , including two nights of Pearl Jam , a final bow ( yeah , right ) by the Who , and a historic reunion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so many lasting music memories it 's hard to pick between them . <p> After careful consideration , the following are what this critic believes were the top moments in Houston music for the year 2000 . I leave the order of importance open for debate . <p> Everybody 's saying their name : Five days into the new year , Destiny 's Child was nominated for two Grammys , only to lose to TLC and " No Scrubs . " <p> At the close of 2000 you got ta ask , ' Who are the scrubs now ? ' The band has worked through hirings , firings and lawsuits to sell approximately 8 million copies of its last album , " The Writing 's on the Wall . " In the process they learned one thing : Controversy is good for business . <p> Citing " creative differences , " members Beyonce Knowles and Kelly Rowland bid farewell to longtime partners LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett in February . They were replaced by 18-year-old Farrah Franklin and 19-year-old Michelle Williams . <p> Within two months , Roberson and Luckett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for withholding money and kicking them out of the group . Matthew Knowles countered with a signed statement by the girls stating their intention to leave . The suit is still pending . <p> The group trimmed its ranks again in July ( Franklin left amicably after no-showing to several events ) , and found another hit single with " Independent Women " for the " Charlie 's Angels " movie . In October the trio made a triumphant return to Houston , opening for Christina Aguilera at The Woodlands . <p> So what 's the new gossip to keep momentum going through 2001 ? How about rumored solo projects for all three . <p> Strait country Enron opening : Enron Field was built for the Astros , but old-school country icon George Strait was the first to test the acoustics at the $ 248.2 million ballpark . <p> On June 11 the George Strait Country Music Festival , featuring Tim McGraw , Martina McBride , Kenny Chesney , Mark Chesnutt , Lee Ann Womack and Asleep at the Wheel , was the first full-length concert at Enron Field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes for the all-day country carnival . <p> The retractable roof was closed for most of the day , but before Strait began his headlining set , the day 's clouds cleared and Pearsall 's favorite son became the first to sing under Enron 's stars . <p> Cat Scratched Fever : Ted Nugent 's woes in Houston started appropriately on April Fool 's Day . While opening for KISS at the Woodlands , the ultra-conservative rocker let loose a political tirade about closing borders that would please Pat Buchanan . <p> In an expletive-filled rant , the Motor City Madman suggested that immigrants who do n't learn English should be returned to their country of origin . It was not a popular opinion with Woodlands officials , who banned Nugent from future concerts there , or the local League of United Latin American Citizens , which organized a boycott of his music . <p> Nugent did n't perform when the KISS tour returned in June . Nugent initially threatened legal action but eventually accepted defeat , saying , " ( It 's the ) land of the free , home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess . " <p> Familia reunion : After a four-year layoff from recording and rampant break-up rumors , leading Tejano group La Mafia regrouped at its Houston studio to record and release " Contigo . " <p> Modernizing its traditional Mexican cumbia sound with electric pop elements , La Mafia hopes to benefit on a hybrid of boy band cutes and Latin crossover hooks . With more than 5 million albums sold in a two-decade career , some would argue that they are already architects of the Spanish language pop movement on American radio . Look for a tour in 2001 . <p> Hard Rock moves downtown : The old cylindrical Hard Rock Cafe on Kirby was convenient if you lived in River Oaks , but nearly hidden to the rest of Houston and tourists . <p> For that reason , the original Houston Hard Rock Cafe - it opened in 1986 and was the ninth restaurant in the chain - was closed in favor of a 9,200-square-foot corner of Bayou Place next to the Aerial Theater downtown . <p> To ensure everyone could find it , a 30-foot neon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Houston skyline . The inside of the restaurant is a shrine to Texas music . A Western shirt worn by Buddy Holly is across the room from a wool jacket once belonging to Roy Orbison and assorted instruments used by ZZ Top . <p> A star is born : Artists had bigger years than charcoal-voiced Macy Gray , but few started out as a nobody at the beginning and ended as a Grammy-winning celebrity . Houston fans were privy to the evolution . <p> When the sassy Gray was booked at the end of 1999 , SFX Entertainment was so unsure of her marketability that she was scheduled to play Instant Karma , which held fewer than than 100 people and closed in October . As her Nina Simone-esque first single , " I Try , " hurtled up the charts , the show was quickly moved to the 850-capacity Numbers . <p> It still was n't big enough . <p> Those lucky enough to get in caught a bare-bones set from a woman raised on Aretha Franklin and Little Richard . Gray captivated with cuts from her debut album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray returned last month , Houstonians were more prepared . More than 1,900 took in her Aerial Theater performance . <p> The Boss is back : It took 12 years for Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band to get back here . Those in attendance have an American rock memory that will last a lifetime . <p> Springsteen may be 50 , but he and his eight-member all-star band can still bring it . <p> They took a packed Compaq Center on a meandering turnpike ride through mostly " pre-Born in the U.S.A. " hits , fan favorites and a few forgotten surprises like " Mary Queen of Arkansas . " The acoustic " If I Should Fall Behind , " featuring each E-Streeter taking a solo vocal turn , might be the concert moment of the year . <p> The Angry Young Man vents : Choose a favorite quote from terminally cranky anti-establishment singer-songwriter Steve Earle at the March South by Southwest music conference in Austin ( a very pro-establishment affair ) . <p> In regard to the marriage of creativity and big business : " We as ( music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Michelangelo did with the Vatican . " <p> Commenting on the merger of Warner Bros . Records with EMI-Capitol Music earlier this year ( cutting the number of major labels to four ) , he stated : " I like all my snakes in one basket . " <p> After dropping bombs all over Austin , Earle and his band the Dukes stopped at the Aerial Theater in November and dropped nothing but hot country-rock licks . His 32-song set covered much of his 14-year recording career and most of his arresting latest album , " Transcendental Blues . " <p> At 45 Earle has studied at the Merle Haggard Institute of living life ( drug addiction , incarceration , rehabilitation and , finally , creative renaissance ) . Through it all , he 's been at his best creatively when he 's at his most surly publicly . <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  <p> NOTES : Read the Houston section on Dec. 28 for Michael D.
