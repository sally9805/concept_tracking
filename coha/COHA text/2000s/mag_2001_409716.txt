Section : MAN-TO-MAN Boxing pundits said I lacked it . Sadly , they could n't have been more wrong <p> IT 'S APRIL 15 , 2000 , 5 months since I last threw a punch professionally , but here I am , climbing into the ring once again . As my opponent and I tap gloves , I remember the last thing I said to my wife : " If anything happens to me , I want you to know that you and our son , Dayne , are the most important things in the world to me . " " Do n't say that , " she told me , but I had to . Because for the first time in my life , I honestly did n't know if I was going to come out of the ring alive . <p> Fear had never been a factor for me in boxing  --  but all that changed on November 20 , 1999 , the night I fought Stephan Johnson at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City . Outside , the autumn air was cold . Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were sweating . The crowd was cheering for blood  --  mostly mine . <p> Once , I 'd been a champion . I beat Vince Pettway in Las Vegas on August 12,1995 , to win the IBF junior middleweight title . Then I lost my very first title defense just a few months later . It took 4 years of hard work to regain my ranking , and finally , it looked as if I 'd get another title shot . The Johnson fight was my big chance . <p> I 'd always dreamt of being a world champion . One of my most distinct memories of childhood is riding the bus ( we were too poor to afford a car ) and visualizing myself walking down the street and having people recognize me . I was elated when I won that first title , and once I lost it I was determined to get another shot at it . Only one person could stop me : Stephan Johnson . He was smaller than me , but aggressive , and with him , there was always a threat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him would pretty much end my title hopes . There was a lot for me to prove . <p> The ring was always where I 'd proven myself . I was  --  and still am  --  what you might call a mama 's boy . My mom , Gracie , did n't want me to get dirty or do regular boy activities , like playing sports . But my dad , Gerald , did n't like this in his oldest son . So he took me to the Jackie Robinson YMCA in southeast San Diego . I paid $5 for a membership . When I saw that there was a boxing ring and a team , I told my dad I wanted to do it . He looked at me like , " My wimp son wants to box ? " He thought I 'd play kickball or something . <p> It was the summer of 1976 . Sugar Ray Leonard was beating up people in the Olympics , and Muhammad Ali was my idol and hero . I was 8 years old . <p> I boxed every day after school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping real life , putting our poverty out of my mind . Eventually I got really good  --  I went 327-10 as an amateur . But I was never taken very seriously by the boxing world . Writers said I was an athletic fighter with great technical skills and hand speed , but that I did n't have the killer instinct needed to be a champion . <p> At the start of the fight with Stephan Johnson , nothing seemed out of the ordinary . He came after me right from the opening bell , and for the first few rounds we went toe-to-toe . That was his style , not mine , but I was going by the playbook : Let him punch himself out and he 'll get tired . I knew if I held out long enough , he 'd lose his edge , his hands would start to drop , and I 'd get a shot at taking him down . <p> By the fifth round , I could hear him breathing . He was definitely getting tired . But he was still punching pretty hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got this strange look on his face , stunned and rubbery . But he shook it off , and he kept charging back toward me . <p> Still , Johnson was wearing down . By the 10th round , he was lunging and missing with most of his punches , and leaving himself open to my counterstrikes ; when I hit him with a short uppercut , I could see I 'd wobbled him . Suddenly , he was standing right there for me . I rushed in with a right , too fast , and just grazed him . But then I followed with a left cross , and I could feel his head snap back hard . He toppled backward , bounced once off the bottom rope , and collapsed on the canvas . <p> Moments later the ref jumped up and waved his arms , and it was over . I fell to my knees in joy and raised my gloves in the air . My trainer , David Love , led the charge into the ring . Everybody was hugging me and congratulating me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still on the canvas . Soon , they brought in a stretcher . No big deal , I told myself . It 's precautionary . It was n't until later , as I was unwinding in the dressing room , that Johnson 's people came down to deliver the news : My opponent was on his way to the hospital . In a coma . I had won the fight , and he was battling for his life . <p> The day after the fight , I learned that just 5 months earlier , Johnson had been banned from fighting in Canada after he was knocked out cold ; his mother and even his trainer had asked him to quit boxing . They were n't sure if he could take another punch . But he would n't quit ; he boxed to escape the same thing I did . The 10 grand he 'd make for fighting me was earmarked for helping move his mom out of a housing project . <p> A few days later , I called Stephan 's fiancee , Bonnie . We talked a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a good father to her kids . I realized then , My God , I 've maybe ruined this guy 's life , and I never even met him ; at the weigh-in , we did n't say a word to one another . All the time he was in the hospital , I tried to hide my feelings from my wife and son , but inside I was a mess . I kept hoping he 'd recover , that I 'd get to tell him , " Hey , I 'm glad you 're all right . " <p> It never happened . About 3 weeks after the fight , as I sat home watching the Dallas Cowboys on TV , I got a call from the hospital . Doctors had tried everything , had even drilled holes in Johnson 's skull to relieve the pressure on his brain caused by massive bleeding , but it had n't worked . He was dead . <p> I told myself it was sheer bad luck ; it could have happened to any boxer . It did n't help . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gym . It was the hardest thing in the world to start training again , but there was only one way to fight back at these feelings , and that was to climb back in the ring . <p> And that 's what brings me here , for one last time , taking on Jose " Shibata " Flores in Las Vegas . It 's a solid fight , and Flores hits hard , again and again . But I hold on , and when the bell rings to close the 12th round , I 'm still standing . I 'm still alive . <p> I lose in the decision , but it does n't matter to me . The fact is , I retired after Stephan Johnson died . I got back in the ring to fight off my demons . If I had n't , I 'd still be living with those demons today . <p> I still love the sport of boxing and the one-on-one competition , and I teach people how to box to stay fit . But I 'll never encourage my son to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like Stephan Johnson . And I do n't want him to end up like the man who killed him , either . When Your Bell Gets Rung The best way to avoid a concussion : USE YOUR HEAD <p> Michael Pedrotti has suffered five concussions while playing weekend rugby . There was the time his head collided with another player 's knee . And the time he fell and hit the back of his head on the ground . And the time he felt woozy after a routine tackle . That 's three . Then there 's the time that ... uh , the time that .... " That 's the funny thing about concussions , " says the 32-year-old salesman from Charlotte , North Carolina . " You ca n't really remember them all . " What Pedrotti does remember is that concussions have made him vomit , black out , and lose his bearings for days at a time . Yet , with a degree of either masochism or self-denial , he continues to play rugby . " You take into account the risks involved , " Pedrotti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big game is on the line , the only thing that matters is being there for your teammates and winning the game . " <p> Athletes like Pedrotti suffer more than 300,000 sports-related brain injuries every year . Most of these men are n't named Aikman , Young , or Lindros . They 're regular guys like you  --  guys who play sports involving potential head-to-object contact , whether it 's with a knee , the ground , or her headboard . Normally , you 'd shake it off . But you probably would n't if you knew what was really happening inside your skull . <p> A concussion is a temporary , mind-altering brain trauma caused by a sudden , rapid movement of the head . But the best way to picture it is this : Imagine your brain is a ball of Jell-O swishing around in the muck of spinal fluid . Suddenly jerked , that Jell-O is sent swirling or crashing against the inside of your skull , making the wiring go momentarily but completely haywire . While many people assume that a concussion requires a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hit hard , and you do n't need to black out to suffer a concussion . <p> In fact , you do n't even need to be hit on the head , says James Kelly , M.D. , an associate professor of neurology at Northwestern University . If your head is jolted just a little ( like from a tackle in your midsection ) , it could be enough to cause a sudden shake of the brain . That makes it important for you to recognize a concussion ; the American Academy of Neurology divides them into three grades : <p> GRADE 1 MILD  --  No loss of consciousness , and less than 15 minutes of symptoms , such as headache , vomiting , ringing in the ears , dizziness , confusion , memory lapse , or blurry vision . <p> GRADE 2 MODERATE  --  Same symptoms , but they last longer than 15 minutes . If they persist for longer than an hour , see a doctor . A stiff neck , convulsions , and unusual sleepiness can signal something more serious , such as bleeding in the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for a few seconds . <p> Because concussions usually heal themselves , doctors advise patients to avoid sports for about 2 weeks once the symptoms disappear . Sustaining a second injury , no matter how miner , before the first one heals can lead to lingering symptoms , such as amnesia , irregular sleeping , slurred speech , and unexplained depression . They can last anywhere from a few days to a lifetime for severe cases , says David Hovda , Ph.D. , director of the UCLA brain injury research center . After a head injury , you also need to avoid alcohol and antihistamines for 2 weeks ; any substance that can cause drowsiness may mask concussion symptoms and make it harder for doctors to diagnose the true problem . <p> Whether a concussion is diagnosed , undiagnosed , or utterly ignored , research shows that even one minor concussion can make you four times more susceptible to another one , says Barry Jordan , M.D. , director of the head-injury program for Burke Rehabilitation in White Plains , New York . And even if symptoms leave for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumulative effect on brain tissue . It 's the reason many experts think repeated concussions can cause permanent memory loss , slurred speech , and slowed reactions . <p> The lesson , Hovda says , is that you ca n't play tough guy by ignoring any injury to the head  --  even if it seems minor . " When your bell gets rung , " Hovda says , " you 'd better answer it . "  --  Michael P.
