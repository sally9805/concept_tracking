one The promise , as I remember it , happened this way . A warm August morning , early . Wally Schanno 's already waiting at the landing . His truck 's parked in the lot , his boat 's in the water . He 's drinking coffee from a red thermos big as a fireplug . Iron Lake is glass . East , it mirrors the peach-colored dawn . West , it still reflects the hard bruise of night . Tall pines , dark in the early morning light , make a black ragged frame around the water . The dock 's old , weathered , the wood gone fuzzy , flaking gray . The boards sag under my weight , groan a little . " Coffee ? " Schanno offers . I shake my head , toss my gear into his boat . " Let 's fish . " We 're far north of Aurora , Minnesota . Among the trees on the shoreline , an occasional light glimmers from one of the cabins hidden there . Schanno motors slowly toward a spot off a rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . Sorts through his tackle box . Pulls out a pearl white minnow flash , a decent clear-water lure for walleye . Clips it on his line . Casts . Me , I choose a smoky Twister Tail and add a little fish scent . Half a minute after Schanno 's , my lure hits the water . August is n't the best time to fish . For one thing , thebugs are awful . Also , the water near the surface is often too warm . The big fish  --  walleye and bass  --  dive deep , seeking cooler currents . Unless you use sonar , they can be impossible to locate . There are shallows near a half-submerged log off to the north where something smaller  --  perch or crappies  --  might be feeding . But I 've already guessed that fishing is n't what 's on Schanno 's mind . The afternoon before , he 'd come to Sam 's Place , the burger joint I own on Iron Lake . He 'd leaned in the window and asked for a chocolate shake . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He stood with the big Sweetheart cup in his hand , not sipping from the straw , not saying anything , but not leaving either . His wife , Arletta , had died a few months before . A victim of Alzheimer 's , she 'd succumbed to a massive stroke . She 'd been a fine woman , a teacher . Both my daughters , Jenny and Anne , had passed through her third-grade classroom years before . Loved her . Everybody did . Schanno 's children had moved far away , to Bethesda , Maryland , and Seattle , Washington . Arletta 's death left Wally alone in the house he 'd shared with her for over forty years . He 'd begun to hang around Johnny 's Pinewood Broiler for hours , drinking coffee , talking with the regulars , other men who 'd lost wives , jobs , direction . He walked the streets of town and stood staring a long time at window displays . He was well into his sixties , a big man  --  shoes specially made from the Red Wing factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A couple of years earlier , because of Arletta 's illness , he 'd retired as sheriff of Tamarack County , which was a job I 'd held twice myself . Some men , idle time suits them . Others , it 's a death sentence . Wally Schanno looked like a man condemned . When he suggested we go fishing in the morning , I 'd said sure . Now we 're alone on the lake  --  me , Schanno , and a couple of loons fifty yards to our right diving for breakfast . The sun creeps above the trees . Suddenly everything has color . We breathe in the scent of evergreen and clean water and the faint fish odor coming from the bottom of Schanno 's boat . Half an hour and we have n't said a word . The only sounds are the sizzle of line as we cast , the plop of the lures hitting water , and the occasional cry of the loons . I 'm happy to be there on that August morning . Happy to be fishing , although I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat and the moment with a man like Schanno . " Heard you got yourself a PI license , " Schanno says . I wind my reel smoothly , jerking the rod back occasionally to make the lure dart in the water like a little fish . There are n't any walleyes to fool , but it 's what you do when you 're fishing . " Yep , " I reply . " Gon na hang out a shingle or something ? " The line as I draw it in leaves the smallest of wakes on the glassy surface , dark wrinkles crawling across the reflected sky . " I have n't decided . " " Figure there 's enough business to support a PI here ? " He asks this without looking at me , pretending to watch his line . " Guess I 'll find out , " I tell him . " Not happy running Sam 's Place ? " " I like it fine . But I 'm closed all winter . Need something to keep me occupied and out of mischief . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So long as I do n't put on a badge again , she 's happy . " Schanno says , " I feel like I 'm dying , Cork . " " Are you sick ? " " No , no . " He 's quick to wave off my concern . " I 'm bored . Bored to death . I 'm too old for law enforcement , too young for a rocking chair . " " They 're always hiring security at the casino . " Shakes his head . " Sit-on-your-ass kind of job . Not for me . " " What exactly are you asking , Wally ? " " Just that if something , you know , comes your way that you need help with , something you ca n't handle on your own , well , maybe you 'll think about giving me a call . " " You do n't have a license . " " I could get one . Or just make me a consultant . Hell , I 'll do it for free . " The sun 's shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared half a mile south . The loons take off , flapping north . " Tell you what , Wally . Anything comes my way I think you could help me with , I promise I 'll let you know . " He looks satisfied . In fact , he looks damn happy . We both change lures and make a dozen more casts without a bite . Another boat appears . " The lake 's getting crowded , " I say . " How ' bout we call it and have some breakfast at the Broiler . " " On me , " Schanno offers , beaming . We reel in our lines . Head back toward the landing . Feeling pretty good . Nights when I can not sleep and the demons of my past come to torment me , the promise I made to Wally Schanno that fine August morning is always among them .
