Getting to Know You Let 's Discover the Juicy Secrets About the Person Who Controls Your Health : You // Most people think they communicate with their doctors just fine . Better than fine , in fact . Fantastic . Given that most of the communication consists of nodding or a request for antibiotics , there 's little to find fault with . That 's the problem , of course . Most patients do n't do a great job of communicating with their doctors because patients often give us too little pertinent information to go on ( remember , just like the detective , we 're looking for the facts ) . At the same time , they may also give us too many distracting or off-topic details . It reminds us a little bit of what a mechanic must think when we try to explain a noise in our car . We 're not sure when it started , we 're not sure what makes it worse , we think it 's a whining sound but are n't sure ... We bet this becomes a tedious monologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost identical conversation goes on in doctors ' offices every day . To be accurate , the parallel exchanges often concern befuddled male patients . There 's a reason that women aged thirty to sixty are the prime decision makers about health care in the United States . Most of the guys they love either have no clue about their health needs or would n't see a doctor unless they had blood shooting out of both ears . // The goal of this chapter is to make sure you know the details and numbers in your health profile that you really need to know  --  those stats and specifics that are crucial to you and your doctor . We always see health books and well-intentioned magazine articles that tell you to compile so much stuff , we get winded just reading the list . The average person would have to take a week off from work and probably hire a bounty hunter to get everything recommended . You do n't need to do that , but you do need to assemble a thorough health history so that you 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A big part of being a Smart Patient is knowing how to compare new evidence ( such as new test results ) against the old . Like Sherlock Holmes , even though something may seem elementary to everyone else and not worth asking about , you need to press on with your questions and your investigation . // We 'll make compiling your health history simple enough to do , but we wo n't oversimplify the tasks so you lose accuracy . It 's a small time investment that could save your life , so get started right away . // You Love Us ? Ditto // The first sign of a Smart Patient is that telltale document they produce during their first visit , or even their fiftieth . It 's a portent of a beautiful partnership  --  that is , when it 's not a form they need signed for their job , or a note asking one of our office assistants about their dinner plans . If we 're lucky , it 'll be their health profile . It 's the sign of a patient who means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our absolute best and who wo n't waste time and money on redundant and unnecessary efforts ( which can lead to errors ) . To create the perfect health profile , circa early twenty-first century , flip ahead to appendix 2 , Sample Forms , and find the forms labeled Your Health Journal . Make copies of them , or rip them out if that 's handier . The forms are also online at www.jcrinc.com and www.realage.com. // Fill them out . // Finished ? Everything ? You 're done . That is , if you do n't have any questions , and you 're sure it 's all correct . Just bring those forms to your doctor along with a baggie filled with every medication , vitamin , herb , or whatever else you take regularly ( in their original bottles ) . Store copies of the forms in a fireproof safe , and update them yearly or whenever a piece of key info changes . Everyone 's happy . // What 's that ? It was n't that simple ? You do n't know all the info by heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's woefully human of you . If you 're like most of our patients , you 've never compiled your important health info before , and you may not have the foggiest notion of where to find much of it  --  or even if it exists at all . Even with using the forms as guides , your records may be so scattered that you do n't know where to start . // Let 's take it from the beginning . // Start in Top Form // Fill out all the easy stuff on the forms labeled Your Health Journal , such as your birth date , address , your doctor 's contact info , your pharmacy , your insurance info , and everything else listed . As you may suspect , this will be your master form , the one you perhaps store on your computer , and give out whenever necessary , including when you visit a new medical professional or step foot in a hospital . ( Take at least two copies , and always give one to the admitting nurse who welcomes you to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life easier , it 'll prevent a severe case of hand cramps from rewriting half of this info dozens of times in the future . And bypassing twenty occasions that require you to blearily check boxes before you 've had your morning coffee ( and having another fallible person decipher that scrawl ) is a no-brainer way of reducing errors . // Under the section entitled Your Health Now , write down every significant ailment or condition that you have right now . This would be the place to list ongoing conditions such as diabetes , hypertension , psoriasis , depression , back pain , and the like . Do n't include anything you had years ago but do n't have now ; that goes in a different place . Be certain to include anything that you 're taking medication for , even if the specific symptoms are gone ; for example , if you 're controlling your high blood pressure with medication , list high blood pressure . Next to each condition , list when you were diagnosed , what medication you 're taking for it , if any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if it 's relevant , jot it down . That 's why your doctor 's office assistant has Wite-Out. // In addition to those mentioned above , here are a few more examples of conditions that are significant : // Anemia // Heart disease // Heart murmur , or any other // heart irregularity // HIV // Herpes // Multiple sclerosis // Nerve paralysis // Cancer of any form // Diabetes // Gingivitis ( gum or periodontal disease ) // Hemophilia // Kleptomania ( just making sure you 're paying attention ) // Epilepsy // Gulf War syndrome // Alcohol or other addictions // Vertigo // Sexual dysfunction // Paraplegia or quadriplegia // Sleep apnea // Vision or hearing loss // Glaucoma // Parkinson 's disease // Amputation // Liver disease // Post-traumatic stress disorder // Dementia or frequent memory loss ( for example , ca n't recall name of close friend or relative ) // Multicythemia veragis ( just kidding ) // Here are some that are probably not significant : // Astigmatism // Dental cavities // Sore lower back after shoveling heavy snow // Rosacea // Varicose veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for example , ca n't remember where keys are , or where you were when Luke and Laura married on General Hospital ) // Sunburn prone or ca n't tan // Insomnia before job interviews or court sentencings // Cat allergy // Hangover // Irritability // Disorganization // C-SPAN addiction // Turkey neck // Repeatedly date or marry losers // Now list your past significant ailments and conditions in the next section , noting when you were diagnosed and what happened . Then list all the details about the medications you 're taking ( all pills or tablets or anything that you regularly ingest , inject , insert , or otherwise consume regularly , whether it 's prescription or over-the-counter ( OTC ) drugs , herbal supplements , vitamins , etc . ) . We 'll say this again , but in addition to having this form handy when you see your doctor ( in your pocket or the office file cabinet ) , always bring the actual bottles of all those medicinal consumables , too . It 's important . // Checklist : We Ask , You Answer // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're still dealing with , write down and be prepared to tell the doc the following : // What caused this ? // When was it diagnosed ? // How are you treating it ? // Has it gotten better or worse ? // When did it first begin to noticeably improve or worsen ? // What makes it better ? // What makes it worse ? // Do n't Know Much about Genealogy // On pages 52 and 53 , you 'll also find the Smart Patient Family Tree . Flip to it and sharpen a pencil . This Smart Patient Family Tree is designed to bring joy ( and longevity ) to your life . The solid lines sprouting outward from you to your siblings , and downward to your parents , aunts and uncles , and grandparents represent blood-relative connections ( not by marriage ) . You 'll notice a dashed line going to your spouse , which represents a non-blood relationship . The reason you need to include your spouse is that he or she lives with you ( at least we hope so ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likely , similar risks . You serve as each other 's personal coal-mine canary . One of you may get nauseous from the toxic waste buried under your house years before the other one . ( Just kidding ! You 'd likely be afflicted simultaneously . ) Also , even though you do n't share DNA ( at least not on most school nights , anyway ) , your spouse influences your health far more than your aunt Sadie in Perth Amboy . Auntie may have a cholesterol count that would bring a Guinness World Records rep to her door , but she is n't filling your day-to-day life with cigarette smoke , bacon , Pabst Blue Ribbon , and lost-sock arguments . The only thing worse for your health and longevity than having a spouse is not having one , in fact . No one likes being nagged , but being nagged into eating broccoli pays dividends . // Start filling out the Smart Patient Family Tree by adding your spouse 's info , if you have one . You 'll notice that the tree reaches only to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other family trees you may have seen . Why ? Of course you recall the genetic Mendel grid from biology class , and how a fruit fly 's ability to pass his tiny wings to his great-grandson was so genetically diluted , it was practically nil . Alas , the apple never falls far from the tree , but the fruit fly must at least be in the orchard  --  that is , at least as genetically close as a grandparent  --  before you go blaming him for any shortcomings . // Are there any exceptions ? Sure . It 's biology . None of us would be our particularly unique and endearing selves if not for a whole gang of exceptions . Include great-gramps and any other distant forebear if they had a disease or condition that is especially rare and deadly ( even a small risk may warrant vigilance or gene testing ) . For example , Baron von Munchausen VI is still at extreme risk , but he knows that . // Thicken your family tree with all the info you know offhand . You want to record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death date , the jobs they performed ( as certain occupations can strongly affect health ) , and  --  most important  --  any diseases they had that may have a genetic link . Your doctor can clarify this if you are n't certain about the disease or if it was never diagnosed . Just list the symptoms the person had ( memory loss , for example ) . While you 're at it , you might as well jot down any other interesting tidbits in case the kids get curious about their roots one day . If you 're like most people , it 'll be about 14 percent complete when your brain is tapped . You 'll need to do some investigating , Columbo style ( Remember ? Smart cop ? ) , so see the checklist ( on page 54 ) for the family interrogation protocol . // Test : Just How Likely Are You to Inherit This Relative 's Condition ? // To better assess your risk , answer these questions for each relative who has ( or had ) a disease that might be genetically transmissible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full-blood relative ? Circle yes if it is your mother or father or a sibling ( if a stepsibling , circle no ) // Y / N Did this relative get the disease with a suspected genetic link before age sixty-five ? // Y / N Did this relative die from this disease before age sixty-five ? // Y / N Was this disease likely caused by a genetic link , and not caused by environmental or lifestyle factors ? ( If the relative was a heavy smoker , a heavy drinker , or had a toxic or hazardous exposure at work , and these likely caused or contributed to the disease , circle no ) // Y / N Is there at least one other blood relative who also has or had any of these same diseases ? // Y / N Do you look like this relative , either inside or out ? Meaning , do you have the same body type , same cholesterol problem , same bad temper , etc. ? // If you circled one or two Ys , you may be at risk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You circled three or more Ys ? You 're likely at very high risk of inheriting the disease , so keep a watchful eye on it . // Hopefully , you wo n't have to interrogate more than a handful of relatives in the above manner . If you hail from a litter of fourteen and have more aunts than a cartoon picnic , however , just remember to keep your radar sharp for two factors : serious illness or death before age sixty-five , and potentially fatal conditions . Either can be more important than how close you and your relative are in the bloodline . For example , your uncle 's pancreatic cancer at age fifty-three would likely be more alarming to us than your mother 's heart fibrillations at age seventy . At a bare minimum , you need to know why your parents and grandparents died , if they 're now gone . And your bottom-line question to your doctor is always the same : If there 's a genetic link associated with this condition , how can I prevent it ? // Checklist : Gastritis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details need n't always be a horribly awkward task . Remember that half will always talk about the other half , so go the gossip route if easier . If you want to be direct , just grab your reporter 's pad and pen , dial the phone or meet the relative at the early-bird diner , and repeat this checklist ( feel free to ad-lib ) . You might consider an opener like this : // " Hello , relative . I know you have n't heard from me since year , but I 'm putting my family health history together to see if I 'm at risk for anything genetic , and I thought you could tell me a few things I just ca n't find anywhere else . Another relative he or she dislikes said you probably would n't help me or would n't be able to remember , but I thought I 'd try anyway . " // When were you born ? ( Or " Who was the first president you remember ? " if the relative wo n't say . If it 's Franklin Delano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) // Have you been diagnosed with any diseases ? When ? // What kind of treatment did you get ? // Any cancers ? Diabetes ? Heart problems ? High blood pressure ? Do you take any drugs ( not those kind ) or supplements ? If so , why ? // Any surgeries ? When , and for what ? // Ever have a bout of depression , anxiety , or other emotional health problems ? ( Ask relative this family member dislikes for immediate answer. ) // Any miscarriages , stillbirths , or infant deaths ? // Any heart attacks or strokes ? ( Pretend you suddenly remember and ask if the flowers made it. ) // How 's your hearing ? ( Whispered. ) // Do you or did you smoke or drink ? // What jobs did you have ? // Still lead in the pencil ? // Has your memory deteriorated ? Do you still remember my name ? // So , that thing growing on another relative  --  is that skin cancer or what ? // A Day in Your Life // Woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across your head . Then you found your way downstairs and dra ... all right , you get it . One of the most time-intensive but valuable parts of your health profile is to get a detailed description of your typical day . We start by asking what time you generally wake up in the morning ( and how , whether you 're roused by dawn 's gentle light , a rooster , an amorous mate , a lapping cat , morning smoker 's cough , and so on ) and how refreshed you typically feel . Next we ask about morning chores , the length and stress of the work commute , the first task ( or taskmaster ) to greet you at the office , and the sordid toils and pleasures of the entire A.M. journey . Then we discuss your typical lunch . You can see why this takes a while . But it 's valuable in getting a full picture of your life and an accurate depiction of the suspects and scenes that affect your health , as demonstrated in these illustrations . Hopefully , this home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We Double Trouble // We know you bend the truth a little when telling us the good and bad you do to yourself . That 's why we at least double , up or down , the most fudged claims . For example : // Patient Says  --  We Hear // I have two drinks a day . I might drink a case a week . // I exercise about twice a week . I rarely exercise . // I smoke a few cigarettes a day . I 'm a pack-a-day-er. // I smoked for five years . I smoked for ten years and off and on for a few more . // My job is stressful . This job 's going to give me a coronary if I do n't quit or learn how to deal with it . // I hardly ever have unsafe sex . I use condoms about half the time . // I get short of breath if I run . Five porch steps leave me gasping . // I eat about two hamburgers a week . I eat cheeseburgers most of the other days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . I remember to take my medication about twice a week . // I 'll follow up with you ; I wo n't forget . I 'll stop back in when the kids are grown . // The Adopted Plan // Logging your genetic propensities is enough of a job when you have your blood relatives close at hand or accessible in your address book . But what if you 're adopted ? Or if you 've adopted a child ? Thousands face this hurdle each year in compiling a health history . Luckily , it 's becoming a bit less difficult to get the information you need . // There 's a trend in domestic adoptions toward openness  --  in other words , the adoptee , birth parent ( one or both ) , and adoptive family all have a degree of contact with one another and share relevant information , including health histories . Recent laws have helped unseal files too . Of course , there are still many adoptees and adoptive parents who have no such contact or any records whatsoever , for a host of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the adoption agency ( always the first place to contact on this mission ) . In this case , they should contact their state Department of Health and Human Services to see if any birth records exist , and also examine the various registries that attempt to link birth families and adopted persons . A great all-around source is the government 's National Adoption Information Clearinghouse Web site at naic.acf.hhs.gov . You can search by state for info and availability of records . Remember that there 's no need for a tearful , emotional reunion if that 's not wanted : these registries often connect adoptees and birth parents for the sole purpose of gathering health information . // What about international adoptions ? Some countries are just beginning to open their records , and the adoption agency and country consulate 's office can be a starting point for investigation . // A Ghoulish Notion ? // If your parents will consent to it , consider having an autopsy performed on them when they die . Few autopsies are done today as compared with decades ago , as it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as a heart attack . But there 's much value in knowing if your eighty-two-year-old father had undiagnosed prostate cancer that had been advancing since his fifties , or heart disease , even though it was a stroke that did him in . This is especially useful if the death was due to an accident , of course . Reassure your living parent that this does n't mean foul play is suspected , or that the body will be shipped to a CSI soundstage , or that there ca n't be an open casket . // Tip : Have a Tattle Plan // Bring your spouse to your doctor 's appointment when you 're giving your health history ; there are a lot of questions that only he or she can answer ( how many times an hour do you stop breathing while asleep ? ) . But , please , before coming in to the office together , make sure you discuss which fibs you 're going to tell the doctor . Why ? Because when you tell us that you rarely tear into the Pringles after 8:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the discipline of a marine , your spouse will shoot you  --  or us  --  an involuntary look that communicates something close to Are you kidding me ? We never miss it . And , hey , sometimes your spouse wants to blow your cover . It 's called love  --  why do you think she booked the appointment ? // If you try to snow us , remember that we might try to trip you up by asking about specific dates . As in when you last did something . For example , we 'll ask you if you 're fit enough to climb three flights of stairs . You 'll say yes , unless you 're older than eighty-five or bedbound . Then we 'll ask , " When was the last time you climbed three flights of stairs ? " You 'll think , and start to say , " Maybe a month , or ... " and your spouse will shoot that never-fails look . The one that says , You have n't climbed three flights of stairs since we voted for Ike . // How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click Access to Your Health Info // There are several Web sites that allow you to store your health records online , so you , your doctor , or any person given permission can tap them on the Internet , from any location .
