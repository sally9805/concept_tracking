Chapter One : Rheela She knew he was coming before she even saw him . It was n't unusual for her to feel that he was approaching . Truth be known , most days she would get a cold feeling in the base of her spine . At those times , wherever she was  --  whether it be doing chores in her run-down abode or standing on the cracked and arid plain that constituted what she laughingly referred to as her property  --  she would stop what she was doing and wait to see if some sign of him appeared on the horizon . Most times , it did not . On such occasions , the feeling would pass , and she would return to whatever it was that she had been doing . In short order , she would forget that she had felt any sense of dread at all . This time , however , when she did see him making his approach , all those false alarms were naturally forgotten . Instead , all Rheela could think was , I knew it . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wafting across the plain , which was an unusual enough event in and of itself . She straightened the strands of green hair that were blowing in her face and turned back to the house . " House " might have been far too generous a term ; it was not much more than a hut , although it was built of sturdy enough materials that it managed to keep the interior remarkably cool , despite the crushing heat . Just to provide a bit of style , she had even constructed a small porch on the front of the hut . She now sat on the edge of the porch , arranging her hands neatly in her lap and staring out at the emptiness of her land . Every so often , she would glance down at her hands , turning them over and studying them as if she was looking at someone else 's hands . They were leathery and weather-beaten . When she had been a little girl , her skin had been so fair , so pale ; but now it was such a dark brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thoroughly as it had the land around her . It was amazing , though , that the vegetation  --  her crops  --  was still fighting resiliently for life . They poked up through the cracks , green and brown cacti-like plants that seemed determined to ignore the untenable nature of their respective situations . They were going to need water , though , and very soon . It was n't just her crop , either ; she 'd been hearing as much from other steaders as well . They spoke to her , as always , with that telltale look of annoyance and resentment , even as they talked wistfully of the rain that was needed in order to salvage their crops . She looked to the sky , trying to feel the moisture in the air , in her bones . Nothing was forthcoming . But she could have sworn that the intensity of the heat was growing , rolling in waves off the land . Not for the first time , she felt a sense of vague despair . She did n't simply reside on the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every single day , the way that a germ cell would battle the white blood cells that strove to kill it . It was n't her favorite analogy , though , because that , in essence , made her the infection , and she did n't fancy thinking of herself in that way . But perhaps that was how the planet thought of her . The wind was picking up , and she heard a distant rolling . Although she continued to sit on the porch , still she shielded her eyes with one leathery hand while studying the horizon line . Ironically , she knew what she was going to see before she actually saw it . Sure enough , there he was : Tapinza . Tapinza 's skin was not a golden bronze color despite the sun . Instead , much of the paleness that was typical for those of the Yakaban race was still present . Not unusual , then , that Tapinza was clad appropriately , with a wide-brimmed hat and long coat that flapped in the steady breeze as he sped toward Rheela 's stead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding it with an expert hand . Rheela had to give him that much : When it came to sailskippers and similar desert transportation , Tapinza was second to none . What did surprise her , however , was the smaller form that was also clutching the main mast of the sailskipper . She blinked and rubbed her eyes , not quite believing what her eyes were informing her she was seeing . " Moke , " she called cautiously toward the house behind her , and when there was no immediate answer , she repeated , louder this time , " Moke ! " Still no reply . She got up and went into the house to look around for herself , and , to her utter shock , found that Moke was , in fact , not there . She had been absolutely positive that her son had been indoors napping , and the fact that he was not was , to say the least , disconcerting . What brought it several levels above disconcerting was that it meant her eyes had not deceived her . It was unquestionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipper along faster and faster . And even from this distance , she could now hear the child 's voice calling , " Maaaa ! Look , Maaaaa ! " across the broken plains . " Hold tightly , boy , " Tapinza warned him , " we have quite a few solid gusts propelling us toward your mother . " Then he laughed quite heartily . Rheela had never liked the sound of his laughter . It sounded ... cultivated . As if he had stood in front of a mirror for hours on end and practiced delivering a **27;838;TOOLONG laugh of which he could be proud . Everything about him seemed manufactured . For a woman whose very existence depended on nature , someone as " fabricated " as Tapinza could not help but set off all manner of mental warnings within her . Tapinza had a fierce scar that ran from the top of his forehead to just under his nose . How he had acquired it was something of a mystery ; in all the years he had resided on Yakaba , he had never once hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . His brow was a bit sloped , his eyebrows thick and green , and the overall effect was to give him the air of a primitive . Rheela 's impulse was to take issue  --  very loudly and very intently  --  with the fact that Tapinza had been reckless with her son 's safety . Ultimately , however , she decided to try and tone down her ire , because it was so rare that Moke looked as happy as he did at that moment . She actually heard that rarest of commodities on Yakaba  --  rarer even than water  --  namely , her son 's laughter , echoing across the plains . As opposed to the " manufactured " sound of Tapinza , Moke laughed with pure childhood abandon . There was such joy in it that Rheela felt a tightening in the pit of her stomach . She almost felt grateful to Tapinza , and she had to remind herself that such sentiments could prove disastrous if left unchecked . Moke looked like a miniature version of his mother , so much so that she derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair ; it hung in ragged braids , framing his face when he was at rest ( which was seldom ) . As it was now , it fairly flew behind him as he whipped along across the desert , holding on for dear life while simultaneously celebrating a life most dear . For a moment Rheela was convinced that the sailskipper was going to crash into the side of the house , and then Tapinza whipped it around . The wheels scudded across the plain , chewing up dirt and sending a small cloud scattering . Moke jumped off the sailskipper and ran excitedly to his mother . " You should ride it , Ma ! " he said without preamble . " Maester Tapinza said he would take you ! " " Titles are never necessary among friends . A simple ' Tapinza ' will do , " Tapinza said to him . But as he spoke , his gaze was not upon the son , but instead upon the mother . The comment was obviously being delivered to her , and the small child was , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . " Quite expertly guided , Maester Tapinza , " said Rheela ; continuing the use of the title , she was sending a message so clear that a blind man could have read it from ten feet away . " However , considering I was under the impression that my son was indoors , I am most curious as to what he was doing sailing around the desert with you . " " You 're asking the wrong person , Rheela , " he replied . " I was simply out and about , minding my own business . I happened upon young Moke , wandering about on his own . I thought that it would be only appropriate to return him to you . " Just to be extra dashing , Tapinza removed his hat and bowed deeply , sweeping the hat across the arid ground . The gesture kicked up a bit of dust . Rheela shifted her gaze to her son , who had suddenly developed a great fascination with the tops of his own feet . " Moke , " Rheela said very slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's the hottest part of the day . You should know better . " Moke shrugged . " Moke , what would you have done if Maester Tapinza had n't picked you up ? " He shrugged again . Much of his vocabulary seemed shaped by shrugs . She should have let it pass . But instead , Rheela felt  --  as unreasonable as it sounded  --  as if the boy was showing her up somehow . Being defiant of her while in the presence of a man in front of whom she did not wish to be defied . This time , she resolved , shrugs would not be sufficient . She took Moke firmly by the shoulders and asked once more , " Why were you out ? " trying to make it clear by her tone of voice that an articulated response would be the only acceptable one . Moke took a deep breath , and then looked her squarely in the eyes . " Looking for Dad , " he said . Well , you deserved that , thought Rheela . She did n't release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . He did n't step away from her , though , but just stood there and eyed her with curiosity . " I did n't find him , " Moke added , almost as an afterthought ... and then he looked curiously at Tapinza and back to his mother . " Did I ? " " No , " she said tonelessly . " No ... I 'd wager you did n't . " " ' Cause I thought maybe Maester Tapin  --  " " No . " This time she spoke much more quickly , and with far greater force . It was so loud , in fact , that Moke jumped slightly . " No ... Maester Tapinza is not Daddy . " " Are you sure ? " He sounded a bit regretful . " Yes ... quite sure . " " How do you know ? " Rheela did n't quite have an answer ready for that one . Surprisingly , it was Tapinza who stepped in and said firmly , " Because if I was your father , Moke ... I would never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response seemed to satisfy the boy . Feeling drained of any energy to continue conversation along these lines , Rheela ruffled the hair on his head and said , " Go in now . You 're overheated as it is . I want you to keep cool ... at least , as cool as you can . " Moke nodded , then impulsively hugged his mother before darting into the house . " My home is considerably cooler , " Tapinza observed . " I have a cooling system now . You are welcome any time . " " Yes . I am well aware of that , Maester , " she said , with a laugh that was equal parts amusement and bitterness . " It is difficult to be unaware of that which goes on in your home . It is ... quite impressive . " " Thank you . " She rose from kneeling , dusting herself off as she did so . " It was not intended as a compliment . However , you did bring my boy home ... and I was not even aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my thanks . So , I suppose it all evens out . " " The boy , " Tapinza said slowly , " does deserve a father , you know . " " Very little in this life has anything to do with what is deserved , Maester . If I have learned anything in my time in this sphere , it is that . If you 'll excuse me ... " She turned to head back into the house , but then realized that Tapinza did n't seem to be showing any intention of departing . She turned back to face him , one eyebrow cocked in curiosity . " Something else , Maester ... ? " " Is it really so necessary that you address me formally ? " " I do very little in this world that I do n't deem necessary , Maester . " Tapinza gestured toward the house . " At the very least  --  even if you have little regard for what is deserved  --  the child should be entitled to know who his father is . " " That is between Moke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper flared , and she took a step down from the porch . " What do you mean by that ? " " I asked him if he knew . He said he did not . " Tapinza idly moved his hat from one hand to the other . " I asked him , if he did not know who his father was , how he would recognize his father if he did meet him . He said that he hoped that , instead , his father would recognize him . It was somewhat sweet , actually . " " Perhaps it was , but I will thank you not to discuss such matters with him . Ultimately , they can only serve to upset him . " " I would not do that for all the world . " " Maester , " and she came down the last step , standing eye to eye with him , " I think there is very little you would not do for all the world . " " Who is his father ? I know beyond a doubt that it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had the pleasure of  --  " " Shut up , " she said sharply , and then inwardly cursed herself for allowing him to rattle her so easily . " The people of Narrin are likewise curious . " She shook her head . " The people of Narrin must have very little of true import on their minds , to worry about matters that are none of their affair . " " You fascinate them , Rheela . Fascinate them and frighten them , because they depend on you so , yet they know little about you . People fear that which they do not know . " " I do not see the good people of Narrin flocking to my door to try and learn more of me , " she replied . " If they are so overwhelmed with curiosity , let them ask . Otherwise , they  --  and you  --  are cordially invited to attend to your own business and leave me to mine . " She paused , and then said in exasperation , " What do you want of me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed it innumerable times . " " No . We 've ' discussed ' nothing . You 've spoken of it , and I have turned you down . That does not fit any definition of ' discussion ' that I know . " He sighed heavily . " You provide a service , Rheela . A service for which you charge nothing . That is foolishness . " " Is it ? " She was only half-listening to him now . Instead , she was starting to detect the first bits of moisture . They were meager and spare , but it was enough to work with . She could almost sense the desperation in her crops . The juices that were nurtured inside the plants were still there , but they would not last much longer if some sustenance was not provided , and soon . She licked her dry lips and looked to the skies , reaching out , gathering strength . Tapinza was clearly oblivious to what she was up to . " Part of the reason people fear you is because you act in an altruistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But you are not an average person . You are the most successful businessman in Narrin Province ... possibly in all of Yakaba . So you would be far more likely to understand it , yes ? " " Oh , yes . Likely to understand . That does not mean that I endorse it , however , or think it to be anything other than foolishness . And you seem like such a bright woman , Rheela ... " " Do I ? If I am so bright , then why did I allow Moke 's father  --  whoever he is  --  to get away ? " " Even bright women have their lapses . For they remain women , after all . " " Your sympathy is appreciated , " she said with rich sarcasm . " You seek to help people out of the goodness of your heart . In that way , you hope to raise them up to your level . But people do not like to be raised , Rheela . It is much too much effort . They would far prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you treat people with such compassion , they are reminded of their own shortcomings . That will not endear you to them , no matter how much you would wish it otherwise . Now , commerce , trade , self-involvement , self-benefit ... these are things they can appreciate and respond to . Since you do not charge them for the gifts you give them , they ascribe no value to them . If you charged them ... " He smiled broadly . " They would come to love you . " " Perhaps , Maester , I care more about being loved by myself than I do about being loved by others . " She took a deep breath to steady herself , channeling the effort . The skies began to darken slightly . " I would not want you to do anything that would be at odds with your conscience , " said Tapinza . " That is why , as always , I would be happy to serve as your agent in the matter . " " My agent . " " For a reasonable commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Province . They would pay handsomely , willingly . Plus , I am greatly respected in these parts , as you know . " " Respect and fear are not the same thing . " " They are when they need to be . In any event , people would view you in a different light by dint of your association with me . Of course ... there are other associations that could accord you even greater respect and esteem in the eyes of others ... " " I have my own eyes , Maester , which serve me quite well . I do not feel a need to concern myself with the eyes of others . " She spoke in a very distant voice , as if Tapinza were no longer there  --  or , at the very least , of no real consequence to her . The wind was now whipping up in a most satisfactory manner , and small dust devils were already whirring across the plain ... a sure sign that matters were progressing nicely . Tapinza , for his part , did n't seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own words , his own vision of things . " We have spoken of this oftentimes before , Rheela , but talk becomes tiresome . It saddens me to see you so stubborn , needlessly inconveniencing yourself . I do not know what is in your eye when you look around you , but allow me to tell you what I see . I see a woman who made an error with some unknown man ... A woman who came to this province with barely enough money to start her own homestead , a child in her belly , and a talent that could take her so far that it would be beyond her imagination . You have no long-term goal , Rheela . You have no plan , no great vision . I have none of your natural talent or ability , Rheela , but vision I have in abundance . I saw myself in a position of power , and now look at me . I have that power . I was able to reshape myself . Reshape my reality into something that more suited my desires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better home , better opportunities for yourself , for Moke . You have no reason not to take advantage of that which I 'm offering you . " " No reason except that I do not trust you , and therefore would not join you in business ... and I do not love you , and therefore would not join you in bed . As for what I have to offer the people of Narrin ... my talents are as much from nature as anything else is . I will not charge them for that with which I was fortunate enough to be blessed . You are correct about one thing , Tapinza . I do have a conscience . It can be something of an annoyance at times , but I have learned to live with it . And if the people of Narrin have to live with it as well ... then so be it . " Tapinza was about to reply when the first crack of thunder startled him . He looked up and around , and noticed the darkening of the skies for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Then there was a noisy , scraping sound , and Tapinza saw that his sailskipper was starting to roll , the fierce winds having caught up the sails and started propelling the vehicle away . Even as he bolted for it , large droplets of water began to fall from the sky , first individually and then in clusters , and finally in great waves . By that point , Tapinza was clutching the sailskipper , having given up any hope of actually managing to steer it . The sail vessel was not designed to handle easily in such fearsome winds . All Tapinza could do now was hang on for the ride . And the winds were more than happy to give him that ride , shoving him back across the plains over which he 'd come . As for Rheela , for the first time in quite a while , she felt the urge to laugh without question or restraint . For a moment , all her concerns , her murky future , and the suspicion in which all those who dwelt in the province held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared about was the glorious moisture falling upon her , and being eagerly soaked up by the living things near her . The flora did not care in the least about her past , or Moke 's father , or anything except what she could provide for them . The rain came down even harder , and still she remained outside , allowing it to soak her through . " Ma ! " came Moke 's voice . She turned to him , standing on the edge of the porch , and gestured for him to come down to her . He vaulted off the edge , ran to her , clasping her hands in his small ones , and they danced with one another in delirious circles of joy as the rain pelted them with moisture and life . The rain would not last long ; not even her abilities could completely overcome the tendency toward drought that gripped Narrin Province . But , at the moment , it was enough , and after all this time , Rheela had learned to live for the moment . In doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to the threat that was implicit in Tapinza 's tone , if not his words . For it was very clear to her that , as far as Tapinza was concerned , if she was not with him , then she was against him . It was n't true , but if that was his perception , well , there was nothing she could do about that . And , of course , if he decided that she was against him ... then he might very well take combative action . She could do nothing about that , either . That was for another moment ... and she stubbornly refused to budge from the one that she was in . She and Moke kicked off their shoes , skidded in the newly formed mud , and continued to dance in the soggy moment that was theirs . * * * The rain was coming down just as fiercely in the city of Narrin ( as opposed to the province ) , and Maestress Cawfiel was not impressed . She watched through her window with disgust as , all through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly as they could , turning and somersaulting . Many had already stripped down to their undergarments ( and , in the case of a couple of drunken revelers , even less ) and were dancing about like mindless heathens . In the meantime , the water collectors were doing their job ; the structures were turned up toward the sky , catching as much of the precipitation as possible in their funnels , to be stored for future use . A full fifty had been built over the past year around the perimeter of Narrin , and the town budget called for at least ten more . All of them fed into the underground reservoir from which the residents of Narrin , as well as the farmers in the outlying regions , got their supply of H20 . The reservoir had , in recent years , dropped lower and lower , to the point where there had been discussion as to whether Narrin could possibly survive . But then had come Rheela , and everything had been different . However , the Maestress knew better than anyone that different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her window , did Maestress Cawfiel , until she could endure it no longer . She bolted out the front door and into the street . Her feet sunk partway into the mud , and as she slogged her way through there was a distinct thwuk noise every time she managed to pull a foot out . The revelers did not see her at first , but then someone noticed , and , very quickly , the word spread . Maestress Cawfiel was not one to mindlessly join in the celebrations of others . That was neither her place nor her function . So the celebrants knew that if the Maestress had entered the street in the midst of the cavorting , it was certainly not for the purpose of endorsing it , or even  --  heaven forbid  --  joining in . She did not speak immediately . Instead , she just stood there , not even trying to move her feet anymore , because to do so was clumsy and not particularly dignified . She waited , for she had more patience than did anyone else in the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misnomer , since Narrin had exactly one main street , and she was standing on it . The street itself was no more paved than any other part of Narrin Province ; none of the buildings were higher than two stories , and were  --  for the most part  --  rather ramshackle . The place ran about two miles from end to end . In short , impressive it was most definitely not . But it was the only thing resembling civilization for miles around , so the inhabitants thought of it as a city , and there was none around to gainsay them . ) The patience of Maestress Cawfiel came as a result of her age , and that she had likewise in abundance . The Maestress was said to be older than dirt , and considering the amount of dirt they had in Narrin , that was pretty damned old . She was half a head shorter than the shortest adult in town , and yet , through the sheer force of her personality , she loomed large over it all . Her skin was so light as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came outside . The rain plastered her short , sensible green hair to the sides of her face , and water dribbled into her eyes , but she made no move to wipe it away . Instead , she just continued to stare , her head swiveling back and forth on her scrawny neck like the top of a short conning tower . Bit by bit , the noises of celebration ceased , until all attention was focused on her . Once it had reached that point , she afforded a glance upward and smirked to herself . Just as she had expected ... the clouds were already beginning to dissipate . " Look at yourselves , " she said in disgust . Many of them could not bring themselves to do so , but a few of them did . Whether they were truly appalled at their sodden condition did n't really matter . If the Maestress felt they had reason to be , then they were . " Look , " she repeated . " Dancing about in the rain . Gallivanting around like imbeciles . Giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some uneasiness among the erstwhile revelers , and then a man stepped forward . He was an older gentleman , and Cawfiel knew him instantly , of course . He was , after all , Praestor Milos , the town 's political leader . Duly elected for ten years in a row . Everyone was more than happy with the job he was doing , which did n't surprise Cawfiel in the least . Praestor Milos excelled , above all , at being beloved . But even Milos knew enough to stay out of Cawfiel 's way if matters became truly difficult . He was , after all , concerned with their political life and the survival of their bodies . It was Cawfiel who had to attend to the survival and growth of their morality . Of the two , she had by far the harder job , and she never missed an opportunity to let Milos know it . " Maestress , " Milos said , making a visible effort to choose each word carefully . " The people are merely celebrating . Celebration is good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that celebration stems from obvious efforts to corrupt morality , " shot back Cawfiel . " And we all aware of the immorality that poisons the woman called Rheela . " " We do n't know for certain that Rheela was responsible for this rain , " said Milos . It was an unconvincing statement , and everyone there knew it . No rain had been sighted , no storm fronts had been moving in of their own accord . Any storm that was this abrupt , and this encompassing , almost had to originate with Rheela , whether the Praestor wanted to admit it or not . " Do not waste my time with such foolish comments , " replied Cawfiel . She surveyed the people once more , looking with unveiled disgust at the sheer bits of clothing that were sticking , drenched , to their bodies . " Look at you . Look at you ! You should be ashamed . Ashamed , I tell you ! I see these sorts of displays , and I wonder about the future of our people . I wonder where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to almost nothing . " I am a Maestress , by birthright , by training , by tradition . Am I to stand by and watch you make fools of yourselves , in celebration of a woman who is not entitled to such worship ? To any worship ? You know the evil of her ... you all do . There is a darkness about her , which you are all willing to overlook because it suits you to do so . Her and that ... that child of hers . And her powers that can only come from darkness . " " How do we know ? " The question had come from someone in the crowd , but it was n't clear who . " How do we know her powers come from darkness ? " The Maestress could scarcely believe the question , since the answer was so clear . " Is n't it obvious ? We are , all of us in this town , Kolk'r-fearing , good people . If beings such as us were meant to have such powers ... why would n't right-thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me ? Or the Praestor , with whom I may have my share of disagreements , but who still seems to me a good and right-thinking man when all is said and done . " " High praise indeed , Maestress , " said Milos , bowing deeply . Water dripped off the top of his head when he bowed , and , self-consciously , he brushed it away . " Is n't it obvious , " she continued , " that the very fact that she has this ability and we do not means that it is inherently evil ? " There were murmurs of acquiescence . There was certainly no denying that logic . " Do not , " the Maestress continued , " let yourselves be caught up in her obvious chicanery . " Her voice turned soft and sympathetic . " I know how difficult it is . I know how tempting it is to embrace the convenient . My lips know the same thirst , my throat the same parched sensation as your own . If we suffer , we suffer together . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thinking , even for a moment , that Kolk'r above would support such ... such abominations . And have you not considered the fact that , since Rheela came here , the rainfall has been even less than usual ? Who is to say that she herself is not causing the extreme conditions ? After all , if she is capable of bringing us rain ... why is it so difficult to believe that she can also deprive us of it ? I tell you that if you continue to embrace that which she provides you , it will end in death and destruction for this entire town . " As the rain tapered off and her words sunk in , the citizens clearly began to feel some degree of embarrassment . They covered themselves , picking up fallen pieces of clothing now caked with mud . " Go to your homes , " said Cawfiel . " Get cleaned up . Go about your business . " " And forget any of this happened , " added the Praestor . But to his obvious surprise , Cawfiel immediately countermanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even for a moment . Burn this into your memories for all time , as firsthand evidence of how those wielding powers of darkness can convince anyone  --  no matter how pure and good-hearted  --  to revel in evil . Only by remembering the mistakes of the past can you avoid them in the future . " There were nods and grunts of affirmation , and the people of Narrin headed for their homes . The Maestress did not move but , instead , simply stood there and watched them go . She knew them . She knew them all too well . Oh , they would make noises of repentance and claim that they felt badly for what had transpired . But the truth was that they were willing to tolerate Rheela , and this was just the latest evidence of that forbearance . At the times that Rheela came into town , some would look away or give her a wide berth . But there were others who greeted her civilly , if stiffly . And no one gave the slightest thought to forcing her to pack up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maestress knew exactly why that was . Despite whatever claims to the contrary they might make , the people had grown horribly dependent upon her in a depressingly short amount of time . Cawfiel felt as if she had let her people down on that score . And she knew that the time would come when she would have to do something about it . She had simply not yet made up her mind precisely what that something would be . But when she did ... that would definitely be the last that anyone heard of the weather witch who called herself Rheela . " Pathetic little witch , " she murmured . " Who could possibly help you now ? "
