As a retired jobs counselor who studied government in college , Mimi Singer 's medical credentials might as well have been issued by the Hold-the-Mayo Clinic . But when doctors could n't explain why an older friend nearly passed out over lunch , it was Singer who advised the woman to drink water during and after meals to avoid a sudden drop in blood pressure . " My friend has drunk water with her food ever since , " Singer says , " and she 's fine . " <P> Singer 's deft diagnosis came courtesy of a medical newsletter , one of a burgeoning arsenal published for consumers . The nation 's top 10 consumer health newsletters reach more than 4.4 million subscribers , many of them older , educated women hungry for reliable , understandable sources that sort through the daily onslaught of unevaluated health information . Singer buys Cornell University 's Women 's Health Advisor , as well as Nutrition Action Healthletter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest and Johns Hopkins Medical Letter , Health After 50 . " At my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explains Singer , 70 . " You do n't always want to run to the doctor , so it 's helpful to know a bit of self-help . " <P> As people live longer , the content of medical newsletters has evolved from basic stories about diseases and diets toward growing emphasis on fitness and prevention . Some try to help readers communicate better with doctors ; others try to help readers avoid doctors altogether . Demystifying the latest scientific studies is still a staple , but newsletters increasingly help sort fact from rumor , especially in alternative health . " It 's a really wonderful time to be involved , " says Dale Ogar , managing editor of the University of California , Berkeley , Wellness Letter , " because so much is changing . " <P> When Nutrition Action began in 1974 , jogging was something you did to your memory , and watching what you ate meant making sure your steak did n't burn . The first big medical newsletter , now called Harvard Health Letter , arrived a year later . Today the Oxbridge Directory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , priced generally from $20 to $40 a year . <P> Why would anyone pay that kind of money when the Internet is chock-full of medical resources ? " It 's not the information itself , " says Alan Rees , author of the Consumer Health Information Source Book , which reviews 47 subscription newsletters . " You can get a superabundance of that on the Internet . People want simple advice . Is it good ? Is it bad ? Does it apply to me ? "
