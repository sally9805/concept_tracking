THEY TELL MANY STORIES in that land surrounded on three sides by ocean , sometimes of foxes with small sharp smiles , sometimes of rats wearing men 's clothing . They tell stories of the magician whose tomb was found empty after his death and of bones that beg for proper burial . Sometimes they speak of their first human king , a son of heaven , and his mother , a bear who had become human by meditating in the deepest and most dreadful of caves . <p> If they mention the bear 's companion , it is to describe her pacing in the darkness , unable to sit still , then running out of the cave in shame , unable to become human . <p> " It 's about not seeing , " Chuan explained to her just after he brought the meal to the table . " The perfect magician is all-blind , all-unknowing . No sound reaches a wall to wake an echo ; no touch bridges distance . " He leaned back against the wall where , Horanga imagined , the cloth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lived in a house in the city , by the river , and long ago the sound of fish swimming endlessly in that river would have distracted her from her purpose . <p> " Then what do you do in this house ? " asked Horanga , looking not at his face or his hands , but at the plate between them . The plate was heaped with tender vegetables , slivers of rare meat , and sliced nuts ; over the vegetables and meat and nuts , he had drizzled three different sauces in a tapestry of taste . <p> " A perfect magician , I said . " He smiled . <p> It was important to understand exactly what Chuan , this latest maker of magic , said to her . To do that , Horanga had to ask insolent questions , which was easy because a woman who came alone to a man 's house had no pretense of virtue . She had walked away from her mother 's family long ago to seek magic , and since no one in her mother 's family would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magicians . She was a striking woman , tall like a tree in the moment before wind and snow bring it down , and she had long loose hair and lips on the verge of promises . <p> Magicians were permitted their eccentricities and their dalliances . So Chuan had bought her new shoes , although she needed them not , and a new umbrella besides , and put a purse of his own coins into her hand , and invited her into his house . An old bargain . <p> Horanga looked back up at Chuan 's face by way of his poised hand and the lines of his arm . She had tasted delicacies from every province , and she understood the importance of this moment . As they ate , the two of them , neither looked away from the other . And as they set down their chopsticks after the last mouthful , Chuan said , " I am , of course , far from being a perfect magician . " <p> This disappointed her . " And why is that ? " She knew the coquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hesitant touch , and disdained to use it . Such gestures belonged to younger women first of all and to women with shallower purposes most of all . A forthright gaze suited her better . <p> " The near-perfect magician , " he said , " desires a single thing only , when desire he must . He desires it so perfectly that nothing else exists , and this is the root that nourishes his magic-making . At other times , in other places , he may live as ordinary men do . But magic with nothing to distract it from its purpose - that is what he shapes . " <p> " So a perfect magician desires nothing , " said Horanga , who believed in stating things plainly . " And everything becomes possible as a solution to the desire he does not have . " <p> " That is it , " said Chuan , and his sober tone pleased her . She had spoken with many a magician in her travels , and not all of them had taken her seriously . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly . Was it to learn magic that you came here ? " <p> " No , " said Horanga with perfect honesty , and her gaze moved to the plates whence they had sated themselves . It was her turn to smile , and she averted her gaze to avoid alarming the man with what was in her eyes . " I am not interested in magic so much as I am interested in magicians . " <p> She spoke of a category rather than a particular , but he understood her well enough . <p> ONCE , A TIGER WATCHED outside a window , yearning after human skin and human manners , but knew no means of obtaining them except by eating human hearts . <p> During the night , when half the moon hung low in the sky and its other half shone in fragments from the city 's great river , Horanga said to the man beneath her , " For the desire that consumes your heart , O magician , what would you do ? " <p> Other men had answered this question amid silks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by furs , though she should not be . In any case , they had said the expected thing to a woman above them . Chuan pleased her by saying , albeit in a teasing , dream-laden voice , " Other than this ? I might walk blindfolded during the darkest hours , with no star overhead , no path underfoot . " <p> It always came back to darkness above all other forms of deprivation . " Would you go into a cave , a place where no light has ever lived , and no wind has ever blown , and even the water has forgotten its wellspring ? " <p> Chuan reached up to stroke a lock of her hair that would otherwise have fallen upon his face . " A perfect magician would see no need , having mastered all distraction . He would also see no reason why not . But a nearperfect magician - why , yes . " <p> " Into a cave while you have only the scantest of provisions to sustain you , and only a trickle of water ? " Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he breathed , letting go of her hair . <p> " Into a cave with no space to lie down , and scarcely enough room to turn around and around ? " <p> " Yes , " he said again . <p> " Into a cave where the seasons blur into one long languid chill , and nothing varies but the speed of your pulse ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> A TIGER CAN ONLY EAT so many hearts before they start to taste bitter , then sour , then like nothing at all . By that point , even a tiger 's own heart , that rarest of delicacies , loses all savor . <p> Our tiger , who once watched outside windows , is not incapable of learning this . <p> Toward morning , when languor had fallen upon them and words returned , Chuan asked his own question . " You only ask about reasons to go into the cave and to stay there . Why not reasons to leave it ? " <p> " You are here , and not in a cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " And so it does , " said the far-from-perfect magician . " How many hearts have you eaten , my dear ? " <p> " Too many , " she said , indifferent to numbers , but honest in essence . <p> " Were they all magicians ' hearts ? " <p> " Only later , " Horanga said , unsurprised by his astuteness . He was a magician , after all . <p> " If you are waiting for a perfect magician , " Chuan said , " you are looking for the wrong thing . You have a mantle of hair wholly black and you walk upon two legs . You did the better thing by refusing to let the cave consume you , long ago . You wanted to be something other than virtuous , which is to say , you wanted freedom . And you have it , which is one thing more than the mother of that long-ago king ever had . " <p> " It is kind of you to say so , " Horanga murmured . " But only humans become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become human first . I have discovered no way to eat hearts , of magicians or otherwise , while leaving them intact . I am willing to be enlightened if it does not require sitting still in meditation to find out . " <p> " Nonsense , " said Chuan , and took her hand , which had strong , slender fingers and fingernails that were merely fingernails . " About eating hearts , I mean . " <p> Horanga gazed at him in astonishment . <p> " I have spent this last night demonstrating how to consume a heart while leaving it intact , as have you , " said Chuan . " And it seemed to me that you were quite awake for it . Or do you , in the perfection of your desire , have no heart left for me to consume ?
