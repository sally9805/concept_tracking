The latest binoculars and telescopes are showcased in the shadow of Mt . Fuji . // Mars was coming . With visions of polar caps and martian clouds floating through my mind , I caught the train on June 21 , 2003 , to Japan 's annual Telescope and Binocular Show in Tokyo . A gathering of the Japan Telescope **25;1928;TOOLONG ( J.T.M.A. ) , 2003 's show was held in the Tokyo Industrial Trade Center . My wife accompanied me as my translator and the formidable guardian of our budget , in case I spotted my dream scope . Like most amateur astronomers , I felt " aperture challenged " as I salivated over Mars 's close approach in late August 2003 . My 3-inch Takahashi FC-76 , although a superb performer , seemed undersized for the once-in-a-lifetime viewing opportunity . Japan 's savvy telescope manufacturers stoked that lust at the show and in the pages of the popular Japanese astronomy magazine Temmon Guide , a thick monthly filled with endless pages of telescope ads and JPL-quality shots taken by amateurs . Photograph UNIFORMED GREETERS assisted guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Binocular Show held at the Tokyo Industrial Trade Center . // " Mars fever " seemed to be infecting many attendees . But the mood at this year 's show also seemed somewhat subdued , mirroring the stagnant Japanese economy that has been hit hard by years of deflation and the recent government bailout of struggling banks . New beginnings At the entrance to the show , two uniformed greeters handed visitors a 448-page Photo Expo 2003 catalog , which confirmed rumors that the J.T.B . Show would end after twenty-five years . Next year , the show will merge with the giant Photo Expo 2004 , which will be held March 14-16 at the larger Tokyo International Exhibition Center . Each year , the J.T.B . Show draws between four and five thousand participants to the two-day event . The Photo Expo attracts about eighty thousand in comparison . " I 'm sad that this is the last year , " said attendee Nozomu Muto , as he headed over for his first look at Takahashi 's new TOA130 , a 5-inch apochromatic refractor . The association 's executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few years while the number of members in the J.T.M.A. has declined . Two notable non-members are telescope giant Vixen Optical and binocular manufacturer Miyauchi . So , Kobayashi figures the change of venue will be a positive move , especially because many of the attendees are interested in photography as well as astronomy . Unlike a show in the United States , the J.T.B . gathering is n't centered on a star party , swap tables , or lectures with bigname speakers . It 's simply a venue for manufacturers to introduce their new product lines to a gathering of astronomy buffs and bird-watchers . Attendees come to see old friends and bring digital cameras to snap pictures of virtually everything in sight . And admission is free . A special Although no used scopes were for sale , manufacturers Kenko and Borg had small tables where they sold new eyepieces and other parts at bargain prices . One enterprising telescope store also sold eyepieces , small optical tubes , and binoculars from a variety of manufacturers . Photograph TWO SHOWSTOPPERS were Showa 's 14-inch Dall-Kirkham Cassegrain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on massive equatorial mounts . PENTAX 'S NEW LINE of XO orthoscopic and XW 70 apparent field of view eyepieces drew rave reviews from observers for their eye relief , feel , and high light throughput . // Astro Arts , a Japanese astronomy software and magazine publisher , offered an interesting product : Having purchased twenty Vixen 4-inch f/15 achromatic lenses , the company produced a " Mars Project Limited Edition " telescope . Visitors certainly will remember the show 's last year as the year of Mars . Selling for a show special 60,000 yen ( about $520 ) , the gargantuan optical tube assembly looked very tempting . " We 're selling it for Mars , " said Haruki Kamiyama , Astro Arts director . Kamiyama said he observed Jupiter with the scope and thought it performed excellently , producing a natural-looking image with good detail . Still , the tube dwarfed the mount it was on . On my much shorter mount , I 'd have to dig a deep hole to look at anything near the zenith . Astro Arts even offered to ship it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jostle my fellow subway passengers with a 5-foot metal tube . As I counted the yen in my wallet and figured out the exchange rate in U.S. dollars , my wife frowned and led me away . Photograph A PENTAX 150 SDP 6-inch apochromatic refractor with a four element lens of SD glass attracted a great deal of attention perched atop a " secret " MS55Z equatorial mount and pier . // What 's new ? Nearby , Takahashi 's optical designer Toshinori Yuyama gave a brief presentation on his company 's new TOA-130 , a triplet apochromatic refractor utilizing two ED lenses . ED stands for " extra-low dispersion " and refers to the glass out of which the lens elements are made . About eighty attendees , mostly middle-aged men , watched the slide presentation of radial curves , which explained the " amount of color is zero . " Afterward , at the Takahashi booth , general manager Iwao Henmi confirmed the hot-selling TOA-130 is just the first in a series of new telescopes . As I watched someone gingerly lifting the 20-pound tube up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a lighter model that would n't give my smaller Takahashi mount a backache . " It 's a secret , " Henmi smiled , saying there was a plan but he was not ready to announce it . He did say that Takahashi someday plans to discontinue its current FS series because the lens is environmentally unfriendly . This caused my wife to flip through her Japanese-English dictionary looking for the equivalent of " lead . " Not wanting to be environmentally unfriendly , I asked about his company 's Mewlon scopes . Starbase Tokyo , which sells Takahashi scopes , has been running an eye-catching campaign touting the Mewlon series , which employs a Dall-Kirkham optical design , as the perfect scope for viewing Mars . Takahashi displayed 7-inch Mewlon 180 and 10-inch Mewlon 250 models at the show , which certainly raised the lust factor . But Henmi said the campaign worked so well that both Mewlons have been on back-order for months . Photograph MANY ATTENDEES took advantage of Kenko 's odds-and-ends table , buying goodies such as eyepieces , filters , and tripod adapters. // Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone wanted to see the new line of Pentax eyepieces . The eyepieces went on sale June 20 , 2003 , in Japan , just in time for prime Mars viewing . But Pentax employees were not sure when they would be available in the United States . Pentax 's discontinued line of .965 " SMC orthoscopics is renowned for containing some of the finest planetary eyepieces ever made . Pentax 's new XO orthoscopic line includes all 1.25 " eyepieces , which is more in line with the growing trend in Japan to use the larger size . Pentax 's new XW series sports a wider 70 field of view compared to the former XL 's 65 field . The eyepieces certainly drew a crowd , with everyone stopping to check out eye relief ( which is tight , at less than 4mm ) and light output . Pentax 's XW series starts at 36,000 yen ( $310 ) for the 3.5mm and peaks at 60,000 yen ( $520 ) for the 40mm . Another looker was the Pentax 150SDP 6-inch refractor perched high atop a futuristic-looking MS55Z mount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be exactly the same when it 's released . ) Among the other scopes on display , Celestron 's mammoth 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain CGE and its NexStar series brought many kudos from showgoers . Photograph BORG 'S NEW REFRACTORS , a 4-inch f/6.3 and a 3-inch f/6.5 , were displayed like jewels under glass . Built for portability , the scopes weigh only 5 and 3 pounds , respectively . // But it was Showa , maker of high-grade observatory telescopes and mounts that brought the richest eye candy - a 14-inch Dall-Kirkham reflector and a 6-inch f/8 fluorite triplet apochromatic refractor . The Dall-Kirkham tube assembly alone costs 1.8 million yen ( $15,600 ) , putting it in the ranks of rich , serious amateurs . Across the way , Borg offered more affordable options . Borg had its two new " jewels " under glass : the upcoming 4-inch f/6.3 apochromatic and 3-inch f/6.5 achromatic refractors . Like all Borg scopes , these two are easily portable . The 4-inch tips the scale at a svelte 5 pounds , and the 3-inch at just more than 3 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer than the astrophotographer . Photograph TWO TAKAHASHI MEWLON scopes were on display , the 10-inch Mewlon 250 ( left ) and the 7-inch Mewlon 180 . Unfortunately , both models are on back-order for months . // " People are more interested in observing than photography , " said Noboru Nakagawa of Borg 's sales department . Indeed , many attendees were more interested in spotting birds than deep-sky objects or Mars . Not wasting this opportunity , companies like Zeiss , Kowa , Nikon , and Fujinon had their top-of-the-line spotting scopes and binoculars on hand . In one section of the exhibition , a dream team " play area " offered a side-by-side lineup of Nikon 20x120 and Fujinon 25x150EM giant binoculars , an 82mm Kowa Prominer High Lander telescope , and Takahashi Sky 90 and Pentax ED spotting scopes . Attendees could peer through the Trade Center 's windows into empty office buildings and even a high-rise apartment building where tenants had hung their laundry to dry on their balconies . " Those poor people , " my wife said , as I tested the Fujinon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day , my search for the perfect Mars scope would continue . Although I escaped my wife 's clutches and headed over for another gander at the 4-inch f/15 , I realized what was missing curb appeal . The Japanese love their scopes emblazoned with huge manufacturer decals like Pentax or Takahashi in Japanese letters across the OTA . I 'm no different . This one might have found a loving home atop my EM-2 if Astro Arts simply would have slapped a 50-yen " VIXEN " decal across the tube . Photograph A " DREAM TEAM " LINEUP of Nikon 20x120 binoculars , Fujinon 25x150EM giant binoculars , and a Pentax ED spotting scope enabled attendees to compare the equipment . TAKAHASHI OPTICAL DESIGNER Toshinori Yuyama answers a question about his company 's newTOA-130 apochromatic refractor , which uses a triplet objective . // But others found what they were seeking . Takuichiro Onishi , 40 , of Saitama , stood by while his 7-year-old son Takeharu tried out the Takahashi Sky 90 spotting scope . Another attendee , Makoto Takahashi , 70 , bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon . At the Takahashi booth , Nozomu Muto came away impressed by the TOA-130 . " Maybe I 'll get the 6-inch model , if I can afford it , " Muto mused . All in all , the final Japan Telescope and Binocular Show was a success . On a personal note , after consultation with my wife , I went back the next day and purchased one of the " Mars Project Limited Edition " scopes from Astro Arts . What a great performer ! My dream of observing martian features has been realized . // For the history and future of this show , visit www.astronomy.com/toc Author Affiliation Barry Kawa is a former U.S. journalist and current telescope buff now living in Japan , where he works for a newspaper . // <p>
