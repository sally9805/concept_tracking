When Steve Jobs holds forth in public , it 's usually to a mob of fawning Apple-ites  --  the true believers who still develop software and accessories for Apple products . Not so last month at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . This crowd was more mack daddy than Macworld . Bono , Mick Jagger and Dr. Dre made video appearances . Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart was in the audience . Sarah McLachlan sang her latest hits live . What was pulling these musical supernovas into Jobs ' magnetic field ? A software product that just might save their free-falling industry : the iTunes Music Store . <P> It 's a disarmingly simple concept : sell songs in digital format for less than a buck and let buyers play them whenever and wherever they like  --  as long as it 's on an Apple iPod . Jobs had proved the idea back in April when he launched the Music Store for Mac users , who represent only 3% of the computer world but promptly gobbled up a million tracks in the first week of business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloft in the 97% of the world that uses Windows PCs , and the prospect of converting millions of music pirates into credit-card wielding music buyers was enough to make even the most jaded rock stars take notice . How did Jobs do this trick ? In a word : simplicity  --  the transparent ease of use that is the hallmark of Apple 's entire product line , including the Music Store . " I 'm a complete computer dummy , " McLachlan told TIME after the event . " If I can use this , anyone can . " <P> And , it seems , just about anyone is . Three days after the Moscone event , PC owners had downloaded a million copies of the software and paid for a million songs ( adding to the 14 million music downloads already made by Mac users ) . In a year when record labels hit a sour note by suing students , grandparents and 12-year-old file sharers , Jobs had effectively brokered a peace agreement : he had shown the music industry how to win friends and turn a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their songs . <P> Other inventions this year may have more altruistic intentions ( like Dean Kamen 's water purifier ) or be more visible on street corners ( like those ubiquitous camera cell phones ) . But for finally finding a middle ground between the foot-dragging record labels and the free-for-all digital pirates and for creating a bandwagon onto which its competitors immediately jumped , Apple 's iTunes Music Store is TIME 's Coolest Invention of 2003 . <P> Long before the Music Store came on the scene , frantic record-industry executives had been searching for some way to combat their nemesis : Napster , the original file-sharing service , but to no avail . Their first online ventures , MusicNet and PressPlay , were disasters , largely because the labels did n't trust their users  --  or one another . High subscription fees and poor selections turned off would-be customers ; most skulked off to the underground services , such as Kazaa and Limewire , which had sprung up after Napster 's demise .                @ @ @ @ @
