I turned over onto my side , pulled the quilt up around my ears and listened to the snowy wind rattle against the outside of my house . I snuggled down deeper into the warmth of my blanket . Still , sleep would n't come . I threw off the blankets and glanced at the alarm clock . 2:52 a.m . I sighed deeply , loudly and sat up on the side of the bed where I 'd slept alone for eight years since my daughter , Maddy , was born . It was going to be one of those nights . <p> I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and stuffed my feet into my slippers and switched on my bedside lamp . Beside me the novel I was reading lay opened and facedown . <p> It was n't just the blizzard that was keeping me awake . Rod should have called today . We should have heard something one way or the other by now . This was stupid , I thought , yawning and tying my terry cloth robe around me . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly phone him at three in the morning , could I ? I walked out into the hall , as another wintry blast shook my little house . The storm was worsening , as predicted . <p> I gathered my hair up off my neck and tried to still my thoughts . This was insane . I was just nervous , that 's all it was . This project that Rod and I had bid on was just that  --  another project . There would be more projects . At least , that 's what I tried to tell myself . Never mind that this was the biggest contract to come down the pike in a long time . <p> I made my way across to Maddy 's room to check on her . We both needed the money this project would provide . If I was lucky , the money might just be enough to pay off all my credit cards . There were always unforeseen expenses with Maddy , with her special needs , plus there were all the normal things she wanted , like a new pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not secondhand ones . If we got the project , brand-new ones would be no problem . <p> As the wind increased , rattling the panes , I also thought about Rod . He and his wife Jolene were expecting their first baby , a daughter , in just a few weeks . They , too , were relying on this money . <p> And then there was Mark Bishop  --  newly hired , specifically for this project . What would he do if we lost it ? In the two weeks he and I had worked together , we 'd gotten to know each other pretty well  --  enough to know that we clicked . We spoke the same language  --  boats and boat design . We 'd had many long discussions about sailing in rough weather , racing in light winds and whether Kevlar was better than nylon for small , light wind boats . <p> But not about personal things . I knew very little about his private life . All I knew was that he was n't married and that he had moved to Nova Scotia from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all I knew , he could have a girlfriend stashed away somewhere , or even a fiancTe . But it went both ways . He did n't know anything about me , either . I have a whole lot of secret places that no one can enter . <p> So , whenever I start getting lost in his eyes , and start imagining how wonderful it would be to sail around the world with him , I have to call myself back . Even so , Jolene had decided early on that Mark and I were perfect for each other . Sometimes she could be worse than a mother , trying to fix me up with every and any available bachelor . <p> Why was I driving myself crazy on a snowy night ? Mark and I would be working together for a long time . The contract was " in the bag . " Those had been Rod 's exact words . Yet , why had n't we gotten any word ? We should 've heard a week ago . <p> The smoke detector in the hall chirped briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I glanced up at it . This was promising to be the biggest winter storm of the season . <p> " Got your flashlights and candles ? " Mark had said to me as we left work that afternoon . The early evening clouds had hovered gray , low and leaden above us . <p> " I think I 'm ready , " I said . <p> " Hey , you want to grab a coffee somewhere ? " he had asked . I was momentarily taken aback . In the two weeks we had known each other , he had never suggested that just he and I go out . It was always the three of us , Mark , Rod and me , sitting together at the coffee shop on the corner , talking about budgets , plans or how we would fulfill the contract in the time allotted . Was this a work thing or a date ? <p> " I have to get home to my daughter , " I said . " I want to get us settled before it snows . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her or why it was I had to get home early . I did n't date much . <p> The few men I 'd gone out with over the past eight years had run , not walked , away from me when they 'd found out about my daughter . <p> " Well , then , " he had said , nodding his head slightly toward me . If he 'd been wearing a cap , he would have tipped it  --  it was that sort of gesture . " We 'll see each other on Monday . Stay warm this weekend . " <p> A huge Nor'easter , which had been making its way up the Atlantic coast for days now , was finally reaching us here in Halifax . I had already done all the requisite things ; stocked up on flashlight batteries and candles and made sure all my doors and windows were tightly closed . I had also filled the bathtub and containers with water , plus we had plenty of food . One never knew . <p> Despite the wind tonight , despite the storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her soft , stuffed yellow animal , Curly Duck , nestled in the crook of her neck . I watched her for a minute before I bent down and pushed a ringlet out of her face . So peaceful . How I longed for that sort of peace in my own life . I ran the back of my finger over the smoothness of her cheek . She flinched slightly , but did n't waken . I pulled the blankets up around her chin and bent down to give her a whisper of a kiss on her forehead . <p> I rose . For a few moments I leaned against the door-jamb and watched her sleep . She 's the only good thing that came out of a one-year marriage to a philandering bum . <p> I crept downstairs , wiping the sleep more thoroughly out of my eyes . I sat down at my quasi-drafting table in my studio/office . It had started out as a dining room in another life , but now was firmly devoted to my boat designs . My eyes blurred when I looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absently , I rubbed an eyebrow with the end of my pencil . <p> I looked up and out toward the back of my house . It was too dark to see , but I could feel the wind , fingering its way through the cracks around my windows , snow firmly in its grip . <p> I checked my e-mail . Nothing yet from Rod . As if there would be . Had n't I checked it a dozen times before I went to bed at eleven ? <p> Rod and Jolene own Maritime Nautical . Boat builders hire him to design sail-to-keel ratios , rudder length and shape . Rod and I were classmates at Memorial University in Newfoundland and we both have degrees in marine engineering technology . <p> His wife , Jolene , has been my best friend since high school . She has a degree in Business Administration and runs the business end of the company . <p> When I went to Newfoundland to study marine design , she stayed in Prince Edward Island and went to university there . Halfway through my last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as she and Rod met , sparks flew , and they 've been together ever since . They were married shortly after Maddy was born , and have been trying , almost from the beginning , to have a baby . <p> About ten years ago Rod , Sterling Roarke and I , all engineering classmates , decided we 'd go into business for ourselves . I ended up marrying Sterling . Within a year I was pregnant and Sterling was running around . It was only after we divorced that I learned the extent of his affairs . He also ran the business into the ground by not getting proposals ready on time , promising things and not following through and lying to me and to Rod . Nine years ago , Rod , Jolene and I decided to let him go and strike out on our own . I was eight months pregnant at the time . <p> We moved the business to Halifax , despite my misgivings about living here . After Maddy was born , I knew I could n't work full-time . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home . And then , of course , there is my own little sailboat that I 've been fine-tuning and tweaking forever . I rested my forehead in one hand as I studied my sketchbook . <p> The project I was so worried about on this stormy night was a biggie . It would mean going back to full-time work . This was my chance , and I was ready , really ready . Maddy was doing well these days  --  remarkably so . When Rod called me two weeks ago , I figured fate or God was handing me a gift . Maybe things were looking up for me , finally . <p> The contract was to design from the keel up , a twenty-foot day sailer/racer for one of the foremost boat builders in Maine . It had to be fast . It had to win races . I looked down at my preliminary sketches . If I shaved a bit off the front end of the keel And then the worries nagged again . Could I do this ? What if I fail ? What if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a million computer programs , there was no guarantee . The best computer program can not totally duplicate what a real body of water does . <p> And then there was Maddy to think about . What if Maddy needed help in school and I was n't there ? I was feeling a vague unease and I was n't quite sure why . I glanced at the time readout on my computer . Three-ten . I really should go back upstairs and try to get some sleep . <p> I 've had insomnia for as long as I can remember . It goes back at least to when Maddy was born and I realized that I would be raising her on my own . It intensified ten months later when I learned the extent of her disabilities . Maddy is profoundly deaf . <p> A blast of storm hit the side of my house . From the dining room there was a door to a large wooden sun-deck , and the wind came at it with such a ferocity that it seemed personal . I hugged my arms around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here . <p> I turned up the thermostat . Then I walked around the first floor of my small house , touching things as I passed them ; my glass model boat , the newest sailing mystery from the library , a pair of Maddy 's gloves , her stuffed teddy bear , the framed picture of my parents . I do n't know why I was doing this pacing . Nerves , perhaps ? <p> Then I sat down in front of my drawing , picked up the remote and aimed it at the little television I keep perched on a wobbly end table . Maybe there would be news about the storm . Or maybe the sound of it would keep me company on this uneasy , lonely night . <p> On the all-news channel , a weather announcer stood in front of a map of the east coast and indicated with a sweep of her hand , the track of the storm . It would gain in intensity throughout the night , she said , and peter out by late morning or early afternoon . Scrolling along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , " Severe weather watch for all of Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island and parts of New Brunswick . Stay tuned to local broadcasts for more information . " <p> Scrabbles of snow hit my glass windows and slithered down like ghostly spiders . The cups in my kitchen cupboard rattled slightly against each other . I rose and stood beside the window and looked out . Snow swirled sideways underneath the streetlights . <p> " Please , God , " I found myself praying , " Watch over us . " I chided myself for praying . A long time ago I gave up on God . Yet , at times like this , I pray . <p> The news channel switched to another item and suddenly my attention jerked abruptly to the television screen . There I found myself looking into the face of the very person who had kept me looking over my shoulder all these years . <p> Larry Fremont . <p> Something like lead settled in my stomach . Larry Fremont is the reason I am no longer a Christian . Larry Fremont is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at my table and watched the screen . Another gasp of wind made my house shudder . <p> One of the richest men in Halifax , Larry Fremont 's name has been linked to more than a few shady dealings down through the years . My fingers trembled . It 's not like I had n't seen his face in the newspapers or on posters , billboards or TV before . He 'd run for mayor of Halifax a while back . He did n't get elected  --  maybe the people were too smart . He was one of those rich entrepreneurs who manages always to be in the public eye . Just like his mother , I thought . Something deep inside me groaned and I felt a rising nausea . <p> I ran a hand through my hair and swallowed . Most of the time I can forget what Larry Fremont did to my family . Most of the time I can follow my father 's advice to put it behind me . Or my mother 's when she says , " Some things , Alicia , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do that , not turn over the slime-covered rocks of the past . But tonight , with the winter storm battering my home and my thoughts , it all came back to me in crystal clarity . I aimed the remote at the screen and cranked up the volume , wondering if it would wake up Maddy . If it 's loud enough she can feel the vibrations through the floorboards . <p> Even though Larry and I lived in the same city now , we had never bumped into each other on the street , which was a blessing . Had I been crazy to move to the same city in which he lived ? Sometimes I thought so . <p> One thing I had done was keep my married name . Maybe that gave me an edge of protection . Or maybe I was only fooling myself . <p> I kept my eye on the television . There had been a death . His personal accountant or lawyer , someone named Paul Ashton , had been found dead in his hotel room in Portland , Maine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continues ...
