Caesar and Cleopatra . Galileo and Pope Paul V. Thomas Becket and Henry II . Encounters between great figures , especially when their world views clash , can create historical watersheds . Such an encounter , writes James R. Gaines , took place on a spring evening in 1747 , when an aged Johann Sebastian Bach arrived at the court of Frederick the Great , ruler of Prussia . Frederick , a music lover with as deep a passion for the arts as for waging war , had summoned Bach in order to set him a musical challenge  --  one that Bach triumphantly met two weeks later when he presented Frederick with one of his greatest works , Musical Offering . But , as Gaines argues in Evening in the Palace of Reason ( Fourth Estate ; 336 pages ) , much more was at stake than music . <P> Bach was a father of the Baroque , the waning age of myth and mysticism ; Frederick was a son of the Enlightenment , the dawning epoch of empiricism and reason . Their musical duel took place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " writes Gaines , the moment at which " the intuitions , attitudes , and ideas of a thousand years were being exchanged for principles and habits of thought that are still evolving and in question three centuries later . " <P> To support this sweeping thesis , Gaines , a former managing editor of TIME , PEOPLE and LIFE , braids the biographies of Bach and Frederick through alternating chapters , weaving in thick strands of musical analysis , German politics and cultural history . The result is an eloquent and fascinating study , highly debatable at points yet all the more stimulating for that . <P> Much of the material is dauntingly complex , but Gaines works hard to keep his prose accessible and entertaining  --  sometimes too hard , as when he writes of Prussia 's ruling family , " The Hohenzollerns were a funny bunch , " or when , in the midst of explaining Pythagorean numbers and the theory of affections in music , he assures the reader defensively , " This will be over soon . " Even the most abstract passages , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music he has been playing on the piano since he was a child . <P> In fact , Gaines ' enthusiastic explications of such Bach masterworks as the Offering , the St. Matthew Passion and the B Minor Mass are what counterbalance his portrait of the brilliant , troubled , contradictory Frederick , whose commanding presence might otherwise have taken over the book . Bach 's hardheaded , self-sufficient genius , Gaines asserts , enabled him " to make his music the sum and pinnacle of all the music of his time and so to prepare the way not just for a distinctively German musical language but for all of Western music . " <P> When the two men met , history was going Frederick 's way and Bach already seemed old-fashioned . One of the ironies Gaines points out is that great music transcends history . In the 21st century , Frederick has become a remote figure , whereas for us  --  to use Frederick 's words on that fateful evening  --  old Bach is here .  --  By Christopher Porterfield          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
