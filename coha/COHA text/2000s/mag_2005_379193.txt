An adult thriller inspired by the giallo suspensers of Italian director Dario Argento , Perfect Blue deftly translates the live-action shock style into lurid-luscious anime visuals while mulling the notion that celebrity is a stroke of good luck punishable by death . Have creepy fun with Perfect Blue ; then move on to Kon 's Millennium Actress , another , gentler mix of suspense and movie lore . It 's an anime tribute to live-action Japanese films , from delicate family dramas to the Godzilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIYAZAKI , 2001 <P> The most noted name name in anime , Miyazaki makes child-friendly films that bring kids into magic worlds where pigs ( Porco Rosso ) and witches ( Kiki 's Delivery Service ) fly with equal ease . Spirited Away , Miyazaki 's masterpiece , is set in a spectral bathhouse . Ghosts of every species set traps for plucky young Chihiro  --  or help her step out of them .

Steamboy , available in two cuts ( get the 126-min. director 's version ) , sets a complex spy plot chugging across its sooty landscapes , with villains pursuing the boy hero  --  in some great chase scenes  --  to harness a 19th century WMD . Only the lad 's ingenuity can defeat them . That 's the power of anime : it 's a weapon of mass perception . <P> AKIRA KATSUHIRO OTOMO , 1988 <P> Apocalypse , pow ! The dystopic future ( is there any other kind ? ) came to animation with Otomo 's film version of his manga series  --  and , presto , haute anime proclaimed itself to the world .
