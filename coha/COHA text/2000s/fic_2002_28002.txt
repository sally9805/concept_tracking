I have come into this impure and evil world To preach the ultimate truth . Hear , and you shall be released from suffering And attain perfect enlightenment . FROM THE BLACK LOTUS SUTRA " There was lamp oil spilled along the path to the cottage and on the ground around it . " In the private audience chamber of Edo Castle , Sano Ichiro addressed Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi , Japan 's supreme military dictator . " The fire brigade found a ceramic jar containing a small quantity of oil hidden in some bushes nearby . And a search of the garden turned up what appeared to be a torch : a stump of pinewood with a charred rag wrapped around the end . I 've examined the scene and the evidence . The fire was definitely the result of arson . " " Ahh , this is most serious . " A frown crossed the shogun 's mild , aristocratic features . Dressed in an embroidered bronze satin kimono and the cylindrical black cap of his rank , he stirred uncomfortably upon the dais , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver clouds , facing Sano , who knelt on the tatami floor below . Attendants rearranged the silk cushions around the shogun , filled his silver tobacco pipe , and poured more sake into the cup on the low table beside him , but he waved them away and turned toward the open window , contemplating the crimson sunset descending upon the garden . From the distance came the neigh of horses , the footsteps of patrolling guards , the muted bustle of servants . " I did hope that the , ahh , suspicious of the fire brigade would prove unfounded , " the shogun continuedmorosely , " and that the fire was just an accident . But alas , you have confirmed my , ahh , worst fears . " That morning , a messenger had brought word of the fire at the temple of the Black Lotus sect , along with a report from the fire brigade commander , which stated that the blaze had been set deliberately . Zojo was the Tokugawa family temple , where the clan worshipped and its ancestors lay entombed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack against the shogun . In addition , Tsunayoshi was a devout Buddhist , a generous patron of religion , and took a strong personal interest in the Zojo community . Therefore , he 'd assigned Sano to investigate the fire . Sano had begun inquiries at the Black Lotus Temple and had just returned . Now the shogun said , " I suppose you have also confirmed the , ahh , identity of the man who died in the fire ? " " I regret to say that I have , " Sano said . " It was indeed Oyama Jushin , chief police commander . When I viewed the body , I recognized him immediately . " Prior to becoming the shogun 's sosakan-sama Most Honorable Investigator of Events , Situations , and PeopleSano had served on Edo 's police force as a yoriki , a senior police commander . He and Oyama had been colleagues , although Sano had n't particularly liked Oyama . As a hereditary Tokugawa vassal whose family had served the shogun 's clan for generations , Oyama had scorned Sano , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oyama had been promoted to his present higher rank last winter . From priests at the Black Lotus Temple , Sano had learned that Oyama had recently joined the sect . Now the death of an important official transformed the arson into a politically sensitive murder case and grave offense against the bakufu , Japan 's military dictatorship . Fate had brought Sane , the responsibility of catching the killer . " The other two victims have n't been identified yet , " Sano said . " One was a woman and the other a small child , but they were badly burned , and at the moment , it seems that no one knows who they are . Membership in the sect has grown rapidly ; there are presently four hundred twenty holy men and women living on the premises , with more arriving every day , plus ninety servants and thirty-two orphans . Nobody seems to be missing , but I got the impression that the sect has difficulty keeping its records up to date . And because of the crowds that frequent the temple , they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " This situation sometimes occurred as a sect grew in popularity among people in search of spiritual guidance or a new diversion . The many new followers of the Black Lotus Temple could worship or even live together while remaining virtual strangers . Two particular individuals might have easily gone unnoticed by the sect leaders . " Ahh , there are so many Buddhist orders nowadays that it is difficult to keep them all straight , " the shogun said with a sigh . " What distinguishes the Black Lotus from the rest ? " Sano had familiarized himself with the sect while at the temple . He said , " Its central doctrine is the Black Lotus Sutra . " A sutra was a Buddhist scripture , written in prose and verse , parables and lectures , containing the teachings of the Sakyamuni , the historical Buddha who had lived in India approximately a thousand years before . There were some eighty-four thousand sutras , each of which elucidated different aspects of his wisdom . Various orders structured their practices around various texts . " The sect members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive teaching of the Buddha , and contains the essential , perfect , ultimate law of human existence and cosmic totality . They also believe that worshippers who absorb the truth contained in the sutra will attain nirvana . " Nirvana was a state of pure peace and spiritual enlightenment , the goal of Buddhists . The state could not be articulated , only experienced . This explanation seemed to satisfy Tsunayoshi . " Will you keep trying to identify the dead woman and child ? " he ventured timidly . A dictator with little talent for leadership and less self-confidence , he hesitated to make suggestions that he feared might sound stupid . " I certainly will , " Sano reassured his lord . Who the unknown victims had been might prove critical to the investigation . For reasons involving Tokugawa law , Sano forbore to mention that he 'd sent all three bodies to Edo Morgue for examination by his friend and adviser Dr. Ito . " This is a sorry state of affairs , " lamented the shogun , fumbling with his pipe . A manservant lit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ahh , I wish the Honorable Chamberlain Yanagisawa were here to offer his opinion ! " Yanagisawa , the shogun 's second-in-command , had gone to Echigo Province on a tour of inspection with his lover and chief retainer , Hoshina ; they would n't be back for two months . Although Sano could n't share Tsunayoshi 's wish , neither did he welcome the chamberlain 's absence with the joy he might have once felt . From Sano 's early days at Edo Castle , Yanagisawa had viewed him as a rival for the shogun 's favor , for power over the weak lord and thus the entire nation . He 'd repeatedly tried to sabotage Sano 's investigations , destroy his reputation , and assassinate him . But two years ago , a case involving the mysterious death of a court noble in the ancient imperial capital had fostered an unexpected comradeship between Sano and Yanagisawa , Since then , they 'd coexisted in a truce . Sano did n't expect this harmony to continue forever , but he meant to enjoy it while it lasted . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a family that he loved , the favor of the shogun , and an interesting new case . " Have you any idea who committed this terrible crime ? " asked the shogun . " Not yet , " Sano said . " My detectives and I have begun interviewing the residents of the Black Lotus Temple , but so far we 've found neither witnesses nor suspects ... with one possible exception . The fire brigade found a girl near the scene . Her name is Haru ; she 's fifteen years old and an orphan who lives in the temple orphanage . Apparently she tried to run away , then fainted . " Tsunayoshi gulped sake ; his brow furrowed in thought . " So you think that this girl , ahh , saw something ? Or did she set the fire ? " " Either alternative is possible , " Sano said , " but I have n't been able to get any information from her . " By the time he 'd arrived at the Black Lotus Temple , the nuns had put Haru to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where the children slept on straw mattresses atop wooden pallets . Haru had regained consciousness , but when Sano approached her , the small , slender girl shrieked in terror and dived under the quilts . When two nuns pulled her out , she clung to them , sobbing hysterically . " I wo n't hurt you , " Sano said gently , kneeling beside the pallet where the nuns held Haru . " I just want to ask you some questions . " She only sobbed harder , hiding her face behind her tangled , waist-length hair . Sano ordered a soothing herb tea brought to her , but she refused to drink . After an hour of failed attempts to calm and question Haru , Sano told his chief retainer , Hirata , to try . Hirata was young , personable , and popular with girls , but he fared no better than Sano . Haru cried herself into a fit of choking , then vomited . Finally Sano and Hirata gave up . As they left the dormitory , Sano asked the nuns , " Has Haru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what she saw there ? " " She has n't uttered a word since she was found , " answered a nun . " When the fire brigade and the priests questioned her , she behaved as you just saw . With us nuns she 's calmer , but she still wo n't talk . " Now Sano explained the situation to Tsunayoshi , who shook his head and said , " Perhaps a demon has , ahh , stolen the poor girl 's voice . Ahh , how unfortunate that your only witness can not speak ! " But Sano had a different theory about Haru 's behavior , and a possible solution to the problem . " Tomorrow I 'll try another way of breaking her silence , " he said . After leaving the shogun , Sano walked down the hill on which Edo Castle perched , through stone passages between enclosed corridors and watchtowers manned by armed guards , past security checkpoints . Lanterns carried by patrolling troops glowed in the deepening blue twilight . The evening was almost as mild as summer , yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scent of charcoal smoke and dry leaves . In the official quarter , where the shogun 's high-ranking retainers lived , Sano quickened his steps as he passed estates surrounded by barracks with whitewashed walls . He was eager for the company of his family , and he had a plan to propose . He hurried through the gate of his estate , greeting the guards stationed there and in the paved courtyard inside the barracks . Beyond an inner gate , he entered the mansion , a large , half-timbered building with a brown tile roof . As he removed his shoes and swords inside the entry porch , he heard feminine voices singing and laughing , and the excited shrieks of a child . He smiled in bemusement while he walked down the corridor toward the private chambers . He still could n't believe that the addition of one tiny person had transformed his peaceful household into a place of noisy activity . He stopped at the nursery door . His smile broadened . Inside the warm , bright room , his wife , Reiko , sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two maids , and Midori , a family friend . They were singing a folk tune . Little Masahiro , eighteen months old , dressed in a green cotton sleeping kimono , his soft black locks disheveled and his round face rosy , toddled on plump legs from one woman to the next within the circle . His happy , childish whoops joined their song ; his tiny hands clapped against theirs . Reiko glanced up and saw Sano , Her delicate , lovely features brightened . " Look , Masahiro-chan . It 's your father ! " Arms outstretched , chortling in excitement , Masahiro ran to Sano , who picked him up , tossed him in the air , and caught him , Masahiro laughed with glee . Sano hugged his son close , enjoying Masahiro 's softness and sweet smell . Love clenched his heart ; awe sobered him . He was a first-time father at the late age of thirty-four , and this boisterous little creature seemed a miracle . " My little samurai , " Sano murmured , nuzzling his son 's face . 0-sugi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Masahiro 's bath and departed . Sano greeted Midori . " How are you tonight ? " " Fine , thank you . " Midori bowed . Dimples flashed in her plump checks ; her lively eyes danced . Eighteen years old , she was a daughter of a powerful daimyo provincial lord and held a post as a lady-in-waiting to the shogun 's mother , Sano had met her during an investigation some years ago . She and Reiko had become friends , and Sano suspected that Midori and his retainer Hirata were somewhat more than friends . Because the shogun 's mother had many other attendants to serve her , and great esteem for Sano , she allowed Midori to visit the estate often . " I guess it 's getting late , " Midori said , rising . " I 'd better go back to the palace . " To Reiko she said , " Shall I come again tomorrow ? " Reiko smiled and nodded . " Good night . " After Midori left , Sano and Reiko played with Masahiro , discussing his appetite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . Then Reiko announced , " Bedtime ! " This entailed much fussing and coaxing , but finally Masahiro was asleep on his little futon . Sano and Reiko settled in the parlor , where he ate a meal of miso soup , rice , grilled trout , and vegetables . Reclining upon cushions , Reiko sipped tea . Tendrils of hair had escaped her upswept coiffure ; fatigue shadowed her eyes ; food stains blotched her maroon silk kimono . She was twenty-three years old , and motherhood had given her a new , mature beauty . " Masahiro is so lively , he wears me out , " she said . " You work too hard , " Sano said between bites of fish . " Let the maids help with Masahiro . " " Oh , well . Masahiro keeps me busy . " Reiko smiled , adding wistfully , " There 's not much else for me to do . " Sano knew that Reiko , the only child of Magistrate Ueda , had enjoyed an unconventional girlhood . Her indulgent father had hired tutors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for careers in the bakufu . Despite all her training , however , which extended even to the martial arts , women could n't hold government posts or work as anything except servants , farm laborers , nuns , or prostitutes . Not until she married had Reiko found a use for her talents : helping Sano with his investigations . She 'd uncovered clues in places where male detectives could n't go . She 'd gathered information through a network composed of women associated with powerful samurai clans . Often her discoveries led to the solution of a case . But since Masahiro 's arrival , Reiko had spent almost all her time at the estate . The child had occupied her , and there 'd been no work for her in Sano 's recent investigations . " What did you do today ? " Reiko asked . The eager curiosity in her voice told Sano that she missed the challenge of detective work . Now he realized with consternation that she 'd lost some of her spirit . That he had n't noticed this before signified that they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refresh Reiko and bring them closer together . " I have a new case , " Sano said . While he ate rice and pickled daikon , he told Reiko about the fire and the three deaths . He described his unsuccessful interrogation of Haru , then said , " From her behavior toward the fire brigade , the priests , Hirata , and myself , I believe she 's afraid of men . I ordered her moved from the orphanage to the main convent at Zojo Temple because I do n't want potential suspectsas all the residents of the Black Lotus Temple areto influence my only witness . I 'd like you to go there and interview Haru . " Sano smiled at Reiko . " You 're my only female detective , and I 'm hoping that you can get some information from her . Do you want to try ? " Reiko sat up straight ; her eyes sparkled , and she shed her weariness like a cast-off garment . " I would love to . " " I must warn you that Haru may not cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enthusiasm . " Oh , I 'm sure I can persuade her to talk . How soon can we go to the Black Lotus Temple ? " Reiko looked ready to jump up and leave immediately . " I have to go to Edo Morgue tomorrow , " Sano said , " then make inquiries around town . " Seeing Reiko 's disappointed expression , he said " But my detectives are going to Zojo district in the morning . They can escort you , if you like . " " Wonderful . I can hardly wait . " Reiko shimmered with happy energy . Sano saw in her the young bride who on their wedding day had pleaded to help solve a murder case , then forged ahead on her own after he 'd refused . He felt a surge of love for her . " All right , " he said . " We can share our results in the evening . " A distant look came into Reiko 's eyes , as if she 'd mentally moved ahead in time to tomorrow . " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me everything about her , so I can decide how best to draw her out . " They discussed possible strategies , just as they had in the days before Masahiro . Sano realized he 'd missed their partnership , and was glad be could include Reiko in the investigation .
