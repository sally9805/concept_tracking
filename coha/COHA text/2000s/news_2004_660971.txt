<p> The sun is shining warmly on the quad at Thurston High School . Kids drift out of the cafeteria , enjoying a few minutes ' break before heading back to class again . A poster announces cheerleader tryouts . <p> It 's a peaceful scene , typical of a midsize high school in a small American town - and yet , at the same time , atypical in so many ways . <p> High up on one wall , a security camera quietly scans the area . Officer Scott Akins , armed and in uniform , moves among the students , relaxed but alert . Principal Doug Jantzi , munching an apple , is chatting with students , laid- back but letting them know he 's around and very much aware . <p> Five years ago Tuesday , at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colo. , students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 fellow students and a teacher , and wounded 23 more students before killing themselves and finally putting an end to the worst school shooting in US history . <p> But a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High had already had its own 10 minutes of terror . A 15-year-old student named Kip Kinkel brought two guns to school . <p> By the time other students had wrestled him to the ground , two students lay dead and 25 others had been wounded . <p> Starting in the mid-1990s , a series of such school shootings shocked and bewildered the country . <p> How could it have happened and why , experts and the public wondered then ? What could have been done to prevent it ? Today , the questions remain : Are schools any safer now ? Is there a better understanding of the roots of adolescent violence , how to detect it and how to treat it ? <p> The picture is decidedly mixed . <p> There 's more awareness of the issue and its complexities . Many more schools have emergency response programs in place , including better coordination with public safety agencies . Mental health programs are expanding . The federal government has funded 6,000 police officers assigned to schools . Twenty-eight states have passed " zero tolerance " and other laws regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I think one of the most significant things has been the increased recognition of the role of students in reporting threats and incidents of crime and violence , " says Ronald Stephens , executive director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village , Calif . " Tip lines have grown dramatically around the country . " <p> " For the most part , students continue to be safer in school than anywhere else , " says Dr. Stephens , a former teacher . <p> The latest federal studies do seem to indicate a decline in school violence since Columbine . But the most recent report by the US Departments of Justice and Education includes figures only through 2001 . More up-to-date studies show a troubling spike in violence this academic year . <p> National School Safety and Security Services in Cleveland tracks violence in and around schools . So far in the 2003-2004 school year there have been 43 school-associated violent deaths nationwide - more than the previous two years combined and more than any school year since before Columbine . <p> Kenneth Trump , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 60 additional non-fatal shootings this year plus more than 160 other incidents of high-profile violence , including stabbings and riots . <p> In Forsyth , Mont. , last month , two third-grade boys brought a knife and loaded gun to school , allegedly intending to kill a classmate . A day later , a 17-year-old boy was arrested outside his Malcolm , Neb. , high school with 20 bombs , a gun , and ammunition found in his car . <p> Mr. Trump , who 's worked in school security for 20 years , sees three troubling trends : School budget cuts nationwide , pressure on administrators to concentrate resources on mandated test scores , and a " been there , done that " mentality regarding school safety . <p> " Perhaps the biggest threat is not the kid with the gun or the knife but our own complacency , " says Trump . " As a nation , we 've got some significant gaps and tremendous room for improvement . " <p> Too few changes in schools <p> Other experts concur . " Schools by and large are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delbert Elliott , director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado . <p> " There have been some specific things that have taken place that are designed to make schools safer , and that 's a very good thing , " says Dr. Elliott . " But the level of preparedness and attention to doing what schools could do is still fairly low . " <p> Last October the National Association of School Resource Officers surveyed its members . Seventy percent reported that aggressive behavior in elementary school children has increased in their districts in the past five years , and 87 percent of these school-based police officers believe school campus crimes are underreported . <p> For principals and administrators , it 's a constant effort to keep the focus on school safety . <p> After class at Thurston High the other day , assistant principal Ed Mendelssohn chaired a new " positive behavioral support " team meeting of a dozen teachers and staff , including Officer Akins ( who also coaches freshman football ) . The school has just got a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as focus on students inclined to skip school , drop out , or exhibit antisocial behavior . <p> Including as many responsible adults as possible in the day-to-day activity of students is part of the philosophy here . <p> " My mantra is ' every adult is in charge ' , " says principal Doug Jantzi , who was principal at a youth correctional facility before coming to Thurston High this year . " Students need to respect a classroom aide just as much as they do me ... It 's about people and relationships . " <p> Mostly , that attitude applies to students and how they treat each other at an age when being excluded , bullied , or disrespected can hurt deeply . Some Thurston students have older siblings or friends who were here in 1998 , and many have been reminded by adults in their lives that they bear some daily responsibility for preventing another tragedy . <p> " You have to treat people the way you 'd like to be treated , " says senior Nichole Lewelling . " That 's how my parents broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As is often the case with kids , " do what I say and not what I do " does not work . <p> " Children watch how their parents act when involved in road rage or other forms of rudeness , " says Jack Spencer , a sociologist at Purdue University . " If parents modify their own behavior and talk to their children about respecting and being sensitive to others , we could reduce the number of these incidents . " <p> In the wake of Columbine , many factors were blamed for school violence : cliques and bullying , violent video games and music , easy access to weapons and explosives , gang activity , overdependence on questionable drugs to treat adolescents diagnosed with mental or behavioral problems , disengaged and distracted parents . <p> Attention to all these things is good , says family therapist Michael Gurian of Spokane , Wash. , but deeper issues need to be addressed . Mr. Gurian has written several books on boys and male development , most recently " What Could He Be Thinking ? How a Man 's Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with " emotional literacy , " says Gurian , which means helping boys to understand and communicate feelings of fear , anger , and alienation without resorting to violence . Just as important , he says , has been the recent " boys ' movement . " <p> This movement recognizes that boys have character development and educational needs distinctly different from girls ' ; that what sometimes seems like rambunctiousness is not necessarily a " problem " that needs to be criticized or punished . <p> " I think we are better off now than we were five years ago , mainly because parents are insisting on better education for their sons and they 're insisting that professionals do n't just look at girls but look at boys , " he says . <p> " They 're also insisting that our responses are n't just that boys have to cry more but go deeper into ' where 's Grandpa , where 's Dad , where 's Mom ; who 's attached to the kid ; where are the aunts and uncles ; who are the mentors ; who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day care about ? ' Those bigger things are starting to get talked about , so I 'm optimistic . " <p> Back in the quad at Thurston High , senior Brett McEldowney drifts toward a conversation about school violence . <p> He 's short and muscular , with a sweatshirt identifying him as a " power lifter . " Asked what he thinks the answer is , he says quietly : " Treat people the way you want to be treated . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
