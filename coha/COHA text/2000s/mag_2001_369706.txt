At what point can you say that gays have gone mainstream ? When Will &; Grace hits the top 20 ? When Ally kisses a girl ? When ABC airs a Judy Garland mini-series ? For our money , it 's when a network airs a gay-straight odd-couple sitcom that 's not just bad , but boringly so . Batting for the gays , Jason Bateman is adequate as a poor man 's Eric McCormack , but Danny Nucci plays a straight Italian stereotype who 's like Joey from Friends ' dumber brother . Add predictable storylines ( I think my roomie has a crush on me ! ) , and you 've got Will &; Graceless . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
