Sister Helen Prejean 's 1993 book against the death penalty , Dead Man Walking , became a movie and even an opera . At 65 , she 's only getting angrier . In The Death of Innocents , she escorts two men to their executions  --  and this time she 's sure they are not guilty . Prejean spoke , barely pausing for breath , with TIME 's Amanda Ripley about the Pope , politics and hypocrisy . <P> HOW MANY EXECUTIONS HAVE YOU WITNESSED ? Six . The man I visit now on death row in Louisiana , Manuel Ortiz  --  I believe in his total and absolute innocence . So that would be the seventh , and three have ended up being people I believe were innocent . <P> IN HIS STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH , PRESIDENT BUSH PRAISED DNA EXONERATIONS AND CALLED FOR MONEY TO TRAIN DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN CAPITAL CASES . DO YOU FEEL REASSURED ? Hardly . See how many people in Texas can get access to DNA evidence even today . And in Texas , attorneys are appointed by judges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over again the same attorneys whose clients almost always get the death penalty . Honestly , it 's hard to look at Bush 's face on television because everything he says is so untruthful . <P> LIKE WHAT ? He claimed Karla Faye Tucker 's execution was a crushing weight on him and said , " God bless Karla Faye Tucker , " and then , after she was executed , he mimicked her . I hate the way he uses religion . It 's a sacrilege to me . As Governor , he had the power to save a woman who had completely changed her life . <P> THERE WERE 59 EXECUTIONS LAST YEAR  --  THE LOWEST NUMBER SINCE 1996 . IS THAT HOPEFUL ? Yes , very . Over the last five years , death sentences have declined by 50% . The turning point was 2000 when Illinois Governor Ryan had the courage to do a moratorium . In North Carolina , they are close to a moratorium . In New Mexico , they are close to repealing it . I can see the difference on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to put my trowel in the ground and go through rock , shale and stone to make every argument . Now the bookstores are packed , and they 're sold out . <P> SOME BISHOPS HAVE SAID PRO-ABORTION POLITICIANS SHOULD NOT RECEIVE COMMUNION . BUT THEY DID N'T EXTEND THAT CALL TO DEATH-PENALTY PROPONENTS . WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS LOGIC ? If you look at the history of the church on moral issues , there 's always been great emphasis on anything to do with sex . But it 's gotten easier ; the Pope has taken leadership on the death penalty and put it up there with other pro-life issues . And well , you know , the bishops try to be obedient to the Pope , so that 's a real calling card . <P> YOU MUST GET HUNDREDS OF LETTERS FROM DEATH ROW . HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH TO ANSWER ? It 's not a highly logical procedure . I promise to pray for them . I try to hook them up with a group in their state that helps people . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it . Some of the saddest letters are from mothers . <P> THE BOOK INCLUDES A SECTION ON ABU GHRAIB . WHAT 'S THE CONNECTION ? I 've seen the death penalty up close , and I know it 's the practice of torture . Anybody who is led to an execution chamber has shackles on their hands and feet . They 've been kept in a room shorter than cells in Abu Ghraib , and for 15 , 25 years .
