Shining a light on a New York treasure as it turns seventy-five . THE LINE ABOUT something old , something new usually applies to weddings . This year it 's true as well for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Apollo Theater . The Harlem landmark where such greats as Billie Holiday , Ella Fitzgerald , James Brown and Alicia Keys took their early bows will keep its marquee slogan , " Where Stars Are Born and Legends Are Made . " But as a very special birthday present , it has also received a 21st-century tagline to mark the twenty-four-month celebration : " The Soul of American Culture . " After all , you never know who 's going to walk through the theater 's front doors . It might be Harry Belafonte , reminiscing for a German film crew about Harlem and his fledgling appearances at the Apollo . Or Paul McCartney , who strolled uptown to 125th Street one day earlier this year , his youngest daughter in tow , to show her the first New York City icon he wanted to visit when he touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been going strong for three decades . The Apollo was launched in 1934 , when an impresario named Frank Schiffman took over a recently closed burlesque theater that had been hanging around in all its tawdry Beaux-Arts glory since 1914 . Harlem was in the process of changing from a predominantly Jewish to a mostly African-American neighborhood ; naming his newly acquired theater after the Greek god of the arts , Schiffman welcomed audiences that included both blacks and whites  --  practically unheard of at the time  --  which meant that African-American patrons , who were normally excluded from joining white audiences at theaters featuring black artists , could mingle as they pleased . Schiffman also brought on board the African-American broadcast host Ralph Cooper , who translated the concept of his popular radio amateur hour into a stage show that he called Amateur Night at the Apollo . From these beginnings , the talent and the Harlem audiences did the rest . The Apollo soon became the country 's premier incubator for African-American performers and an essential showplace for entertainment , from vaudeville to swing , jazz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While respecting the storied past of such programming institutions as Amateur Night , Showtime at the Apollo and the Apollo Legends Hall of Fame , the theater is in the midst of a building-restoration project , for which $53 million of the $96 million goal has been raised . The signature marquee has been spruced up and the backstage area modernized ; a new sound system has been added , and sleek red-velvet seats have replaced the tattered old ones . The next phase , which in light of the dim economy may take a few more years , will include a renewal of the interior 's Art Deco details , a lobby expansion and the addition of a caf and shop . The 2009 roster , which kicked off in January with a special Amateur Night , gained momentum this spring when the Apollo hosted part of the Carnegie Hall festival " Honor ! A Celebration of the African American Cultural Legacy , " curated by Jessye Norman .

Jonelle Procope , president of the Apollo Theater Foundation , says it 's more important than ever that this anniversary milestone see the institution " become a destination , tapping into different audiences ; it has always been about breaking down barriers : racial , musical , social . " Procope , a former entertainment lawyer with family roots in Harlem , was recruited in 2003 by board chairman Richard D. Parsons , onetime CEO of Time Warner and current chairman of Citigroup , to be the Apollo 's leader . She explains that given the theater 's small size  --  1,536 seats is a fraction of what many concert venues offer  --  the economic model can no longer be commercial . " We have been establishing ourselves as part of the not-for-profit community , and our new programming initiatives reflect that . " The Apollo continues to plan for a 21st-century future . Recent innovations include the Apollo Theater Academy , which introduces high-school students to a variety of behind-the-scenes professions through its Saturday Workshop Series , Master Classes and summer internships .
