Oimmeddam // Feodosiya sits on the eastern coast of the crimea , a rectangular spit of land where the Eurasian steppe stops to dip its toe into the Black Sea . Today the city is a rusty wasteland of post-Soviet decay . But in the Middle Ages , when Feodosiya was called Caffa and a Genoese proconsul sat in a white palace above the harbor , the city was one of the fastest-growing ports in the medieval world . In 1266 , when the Genoese first arrived in southern Russia , Caffa was a primitive fishing village tucked away far from the eyes of God and man on the dark side of the Crimea  --  a collection of windswept lean-tos set between an empty sea and a ring of low-rising hills . Eighty years later , seventy thousand to eighty thousand people coursed through Caffa 's narrow streets , and a dozen different tongues echoed through its noisy markets . Thrusting church spires and towers crowded the busy skyline , while across the bustling town docks flowed Merdacaxi silks from Central Asia , sturgeon from the Don , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Russian forests to the north . Surveying Caffa in 1340 , a Muslim visitor declared it a handsome town of " beautiful markets with a worthy port in which I saw two hundred ships big and small . " // It would be an exaggeration to say that the Genoese willed Caffa into existence , but not a large exaggeration . No city-state bestrode the age of city-states with a more operatic sense of destiny  --  none possessed a more fervent desire to cut a bella figura in the world  --  than Genoa . The city 's galleys could be found in every port from London to the Black Sea , its merchants in every trading center from Aleppo ( Syria ) to Peking . The invincible courage and extraordinary seamanship of the Genoese mariner was legendary . Long before Christopher Columbus , there were the Vivaldi brothers , Ugolino and Vadino , who fell off the face of the earth laughing at death as they searched for a sea route to India . Venice , Genoa 's great rival , might carp that she was " a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women without shame , " but Genoese grandeur was impervious to such insults . In Caffa , Genoa built a monument to itself . The port 's sunlit piazzas and fine stone houses , the lovely women who walked along its quays with the brocades of Persia on their backs and the perfumes of Arabia gracing their skin , were monuments to Genoese wealth , virtue , piety , and imperial glory . // As an Italian poet of the time noted , // And so many are the Genoese // And so spread ... throughout the world // That wherever one goes and stays // He makes another Genoa there . // Caffa 's meteoric rise to international prominence also owed something to geography and economics . Between 1250 and 1350 the medieval world experienced an early burst of globalization , and Caffa , located at the southeastern edge of European Russia , was perfectly situated to exploit the new global economy . To the north , through a belt of dense forest , lay the most magnificent land route in the medieval world , the Eurasian steppe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , and big sky that could deliver a traveler from the Crimea to China in eight to twelve months . To the west lay the teeming port of Constantinople , wealthiest city in Christendom , and beyond Constantinople , the slave markets of the Levant , where big-boned , blond Ukrainians fetched a handsome price at auction . Farther west lay Europe , where the tangy spices of Ceylon and Java and the sparkling diamonds of Golconda were in great demand . And between these great poles of the medieval world lay Caffa , with its " worthy port " and phalanx of mighty Russian rivers : the Volga and Don immediately to the east , the Dnieper to the west . In the first eight decades of Genoese rule the former fishing village doubled , tripled , and quadrupled in size . Then the population quadrupled a second , third , and fourth time ; new neighborhoods and churches sprang up ; six thousand new houses rose inside the city , and then an additional eleven thousand in the muddy flats beyond the town walls . Every year more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed across Caffa 's wharves . On a fine spring evening in 1340 , one can imagine the Genoese proconsul standing on his balcony , surveying the tall-masted ships bobbing on a twilight tide in the harbor , and thinking that Caffa would go on growing forever , that nothing would ever change , except that the city would grow ever bigger and wealthier . That dream , of course , was as fantastic a fairy tale in the fourteenth century as it is today . Explosive growth  --  and human hubris  --  always come with a price . // Before the arrival of the Genoese , Caffa 's vulnerability to ecological disaster extended no farther than the few thousand meters of the Black Sea its fishermen fished and the half moon of sullen , windswept hills behind the city . By 1340 trade routes linked the port to places half a world away  --  places even the Genoese knew little about  --  and in some of the places strange and terrible things were happening . In the 1330s there were reports of tremendous environmental upheaval in China . Canton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrential rain and parching drought , and in Honan mile-long swarms of locusts were reported to have blacked out the sun . Legend also has it that in this period , the earth under China gave way and whole villages disappeared into fissures and cracks in the ground . An earthquake is reported to have swallowed part of a city , Kingsai , then a mountain , Tsincheou , and in the mountains of Ki-ming-chan , to have torn open a hole large enough to create a new " lake a hundred leagues long . " In Tche , it was said that 5 million people were killed in the upheavals . On the coast of the South China Sea , the ominous rumble of " subterranean thunder " was heard ... //
