There was widespread shock and dismay last year when researchers reported that a popular combination of female hormones called Prempro , taken for more than a couple of years , increases a woman 's risk of developing heart disease and breast cancer . The news seemed to sound the death knell for long-term hormone-replacement therapy ( HRT ) . Yet even at the time , scientists recognized that there was a chance for a reprieve : the estrogen-progestin mix might still delay or even prevent various kinds of dementia , including Alzheimer 's disease . To find out , researchers began a careful analysis of a subset of data from the same Women 's Health Initiative that had stirred up such a fuss in the first place . <P> Now the analysis is complete , and even that last hope has been extinguished . Not only does Prempro not protect against dementia , but older women who take it for long periods of time also double their risk of developing Alzheimer 's and other cognitive problems . The news , published in last week 's Journal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal investigator Sally Shumaker , a public-health expert at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem , N.C. Earlier studies had suggested that female hormones might be good for the brain . <P> As is usual with reports like this , there are a few caveats to keep in mind . But the overall conclusion is inescapable : most women should n't be taking HRT for extended periods of time after menopause . <P> Although the study results directly apply only to Prempro , its conclusions probably also cover other estrogen-progestin combinations . At any rate , those drugs would need to be studied as vigorously as Prempro has been for any manufacturer to claim otherwise . ( Wyeth Pharmaceuticals deserves a good corporate-citizenship award for allowing its product to be so thoroughly vetted and for even paying for some of the work . ) It is also important to recognize that the absolute number of extra cases of Alzheimer 's disease due to HRT is very small . <P> Intriguingly , the parts of the Women 's Health Initiative that look at the possible long-term health benefits of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that estrogen alone may yet prove beneficial . ( Only women who have undergone a hysterectomy can safely take estrogen alone ; estrogen without progestin increases the risk of uterine cancer . ) <P> So what 's a woman to do ? HRT is still the most widely effective medication available for the treatment of acute menopausal symptoms like night sweats and hot flashes . It 's O.K. to take it for that reason ; just keep the dosage low , and take it for less than two years . As an alternative , some women swear by natural remedies , such as black cohosh and yam creams . <P> If , on the other hand , you 're more concerned about preventing dementia or heart disease , you will have to go back to the basics : exercise , eat right and watch your weight . You should also find out if you have high blood pressure or diabetes and get treated if you do ; both conditions are known to increase one 's risk of heart disease or stroke , and there is growing evidence that they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adopting a healthy lifestyle may not be as easy as popping a pill , but the effects are much longer lasting .
