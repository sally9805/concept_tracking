Chapter One DRUMODYN CASTLE SCOTLAND , THE FAR NORTH AUTUMN 1344 Hugh the Bastard . The three words dealt Mariota Macnicol a smiting blow , each one lodging in her throat like searing lumps of hot-burning coal as she stood on the threshold of the tower bedchamber and stared at the man she loved more than life itself . Certainly more than her own , for she 'd willingly suffered the pains of scandal and ruin to be his lady , turning her back on her well-comforted existence to pave him the way to his dreams . His lofty ambitions . And now Hugh Alesone , Bastard of Drumodyn , was dead . Or soon would be , for the twinkling blue eyes that had e'er besotted her were now full-glazed and bulging , the horror on his handsome face as he caught sight of her , an unmistakable recognition of his imminent end . Aye , Mariota 's golden giant of a Highland lover was about to die naked in his bed . Naked in the arms of an equally unclothed whore . Shivering , Mariota stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her , stealing her breath until her anguish rose in a tide of fury , and the welling pain burst free . " No-o-o , " she cried , agony ripping her soul . " By the living God ! Hugh .... " " ' T is m-my heart , " he gasped , his eyes widening . Her own heart poundingfuriously , Mariota bit down on her lip as he broke away from the sweat-dampened bawd straddling him and pressed both hands against his chest , its well-muscled planes , resplendent with a smattering of golden hairs , proving as drenched and heaving as his whore 's fleshy , over-generous breasts . His penis glistened as well , highlighted almost obscenely by the glow of the night candle . Flaccid now , and surprisingly small for such a great stirk of a Highlandman , the dangling appendage was clearly wet from vigorous love play . A truth underscored by the disarray of the bed coverings , the flagon of wine and two half-emptied goblets on a fireside table , and the trail of discarded clothing littering the rush-strewn floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging so heavily in the chill air . " Saints have mercy ! " Mariota clapped her hands to her face , the only movement she could manage for her legs felt leaden , her feet as roots of stone . The other woman suffered no such loss of agility , scrambling off the bed so swiftly her ungainly efforts to extract herself would have been comical if her very presence did n't feel like a vise around Mariota 's heart . All but spitting and snarling , the bawd flung the last of the bed coverlets from her naked body , knocking over the flagon of wine in her clumsiness , the blood-red libations splashing onto the floor rushes . Watching her exodus , Mariota curled her hands into fists . The back of her neck throbbed , its tender skin blazing as her gaze lit on the spilled wine , some still coherent part of her seeing a reflection of Hugh 's ignoble demise in the quickly spreading stain . An irony the Bastard of Drumodyn would miss for he 'd collapsed onto the bedsheets , lay staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them sent a bitter , piercing cold sluicing through her . " Dear sweet saints , " she gasped , more to herself than the woman still looming so naked beside the bed . " He 's dying .... " But Hugh Alesone was already gone , having left to join his forebears , breathing his inglorious last without a further word spoken . And with his departure , a great gusting wind rushed into the room , guttering candles and sweeping across a worktable strewn with parchments , the icy blast scattering his treasured writings to every corner of the room . Love sonnets , the most of them , and composed for Mariota , but also painstakingly gathered accountings of the ancient line from which Hugh claimed descent-even if his bastardy had constrained him to subsist on little more than his own silvered words and broth of limpets and milk . Good enough fare until Mariota 's munificence enabled the would-be bard to indulge his higher tastes and live as befitted one who believed to carry the blood of kings . Scarce able to believe him dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she backed away as quickly , something about the woman 's moist red lips and the slant of her eyes , prickling Mariota 's nape . " You ! " she cried , awareness slamming into her . " You are- " " Elizabeth Paterson , " the whore supplied , her gray eyes cold and glittery as a winter dawn . In numbed shock , Mariota recognized her with surety now . If not by name , then by reputation , for the woman was none other than the notorious alewife of Assynt . Widowed and slightly older than Hugh , Elizabeth Paterson ran the Burning Bush , an establishment of less than noble repute where the high-spirited widow was rumored to offer wayfarers much more than victuals and simple lodgings . The air around Mariota grew colder . " You are the alewife , " she said , the acknowledgment sounding faraway , her voice a stranger 's . " And that surprises you ? " Nowise inhibited , the bawd made no attempt to cover her spurious charms . " Did you not know Hugh had dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone like me ? " Mariota gritted her teeth , her world splitting open to become a yawning void filled with naught but Hugh 's naked , inert form and the triumphant little sneer playing about the alewife 's generous , love-swollen lips . " Be gone from here . " Mariota flicked a hand at the crumpled clothes on the floor . " Dress , and take yourself from my sight . " The bawd ignored that and lifted her chin . " A pity you returned sooner than expected , Lady Mariota , " she said , her throaty voice taunting . " You might have been left to your illusions had it been otherwise . " Mariota stiffened , something inside her cracking , turning her to stone . " I turned back before even nearing Dunach , " she admitted , the name of her home bitter on her tongue . " Praise God I did not plead my father 's beneficence yet again- " The alewife sniffed . " I told Hugh he 'd seen the last of Archibald Macnicol 's coin . Word of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sliding a hand down her belly , the bawd let her fingers hover above the dark tangle of her nether hair . " See you , Mariota of Dunach , Hugh knew you might return early , but he did not want to forego our amusements . " Mariota 's eyes began to sting , hot gall rising in her throat . Equally damning , she seemed unable to lift her gaze from the other woman 's abdomen . Elizabeth Paterson 's decidedly swollen abdomen . Her emotions churning , Mariota dug her hands into her skirts . " It would seem the two of you indulged often enough . " The other shrugged . " That may be , but ' t is not Hugh 's child I carry . Not that he cared . Truth be told , he took great relish in hearing of my encounters at the alehouse . " Mariota stared at her , wordless . The alewife 's lips quirked . " If you would know the whole of it , " she said , reaching to trail her fingers across Mariota 's stomach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sweetness to a ripening plum . His get , or no . " Recoiling from the woman 's touch as well as her words , it took Mariota a moment to notice the multicolored bursts of light suddenly flashing about the alewife 's fingers , and yet another to recognize the bawd 's true purpose in putting her hand to Mariota 's waist . " My dirk ! " Mariota 's heart slammed against her ribs at the sight of her bejeweled lady 's dagger in the other 's hand . She fumbled at her skirts , her cold fingers finding the blade 's empty sheath , the discovery sending chills down her spine . " You 've stolen my dirk ! " " Say you ? " The alewife feigned astonishment . " Och , nay , my lady , ' t is not stealing it I am-only borrowing . " " Borrowing ? " The alewife nodded , her mouth curving in a satisfied smile as she returned to the bed and , with the dirk 's blade , swept several of Hugh 's windblown parchments onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mattress , she waved the thing at Mariota . " See you , lady , to your face he called you his minx but behind your back he named you a fool , " she said , her tone steeped in derision . " I was neither . Ours was an understanding of mutual fulfillment and I meant to use him as boldly as he used me . " Her eyes flashing , she yanked the scroll off the dagger and tossed it at Hugh 's body , her mouth twisting in another mirthless smile when the parchment landed on his shriveled manhood . But , as quickly , her attention flickered to the half opened window shutters across the room , and something about the glint in her eyes iced Mariota 's blood . " Did you know that your precious Hugh carved footholds in the outer wall of this tower ? " She spoke softly , her fingers playing over the gemstones in the dagger 's hilt . " He cut them there to allow such as me to win in and out of this chamber discreetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I see nary a shred of discretion on you . " The odd look in Elizabeth Paterson 's eyes intensified , her expression hardening . " The need for suchlike is past , would you not agree ? " Mariota held her rival 's stare and hoped her own features appeared as cold . Drawing a deep breath , she strove to ignore the tight edges of fear beginning to beat through her , the rapid hammering of her heart . " Tcha , my lady , all that remains is my need for revenge . " The woman 's contemptuous glance slid over Mariota . " Aye , vengeance will be mine and served on you ! " she hissed , hauling out to slap Mariota full across the face . Mariota gasped , the smashing blow sending her reeling . She flung up an arm to stave off further blows , but her knees gave out and she sank to the floor . " Not so proud now , are you ? " The whore 's face darkened with malice . Mariota blinked , tried not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's menace and her own pain slipped over her like a sheet of cloaking ice . " Fie , but you have lost your wits , eh ? " The alewife leaned close , spite pouring off her . " You 'd best gather them , for when I climb out yon window , your life will be worth less than these floor rushes , " she vowed , scooping up a handful and letting them drift onto Mariota 's head . " A meet revenge , Mariota of Dunach , for with your untimely return , you have ruined my life ! " Mariota stared at her , the woman 's gall restoring her tongue if not her strength . " ' T is you who- " " ' T is I who could have made Hugh a master at barderie , " the other boasted , waving the dagger for emphasis . " You come of a long line of fighting men , warrior lairds who live by the sword , " she went on , her eyes blazing . " I have the blood of poets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on his way . So soon as he 'd amassed enough coin for us to journey forth from this bog-ridden land of dark hills and desolation . " " Sweet Jesu , you are mad , " Mariota breathed , her cheek still burning like a brand . " Hugh would ne'er- " " Hugh would as he pleased , and he ne'er intended to make you his wife , " the other flashed , bringing the blade dangerously close to Mariota 's face . " But if it soothes your mind , I had no use for him beyond his promise to settle me with a new alehouse-a fine establishment to serve a better lot than frequent the Burning Bush . " Mariota struggled to her knees , silently cursing the light-headedness that kept her from standing . She did turn a blistering stare on the woman . " And now you , like I , have nothing . " " Not so , " Elizabeth Paterson disagreed , whirling back to the bed , a whooshing streak of steel revealing her intent . " No-o-o ! " Mariota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bastard 's chest . " In sweet mercy 's name ! " " Not mercy , revenge . " Her tone chilling , the ghastly deed done , the alewife calmly retrieved her gown from the parchment-littered floor and crossed to the windows . Heedless of her nakedness and with her flaunting wealth of hair swirling around her , she tossed her gown into the dark night beyond , hoisted herself onto the broad stone ledge . " Be warned . Hugh 's men will have heard the ruckus , " she said , looking pleased . " When they come , your dirk will be raging from the Bastard 's heart . You will be thought to have murdered him . Vengeance will be mine . " And then she was gone , her parting words echoing in the empty chamber , the threat behind them giving Mariota the strength to clamber to her feet . She staggered forward , intent on reclaiming her dagger however mean the task , but the moment her fingers curled around the blade 's jeweled hilt , the sudden clamor of pounding feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage and disbelief . Hugh 's men . A half score of them pushed into the room , ready anger flaring on their bearded faces , hot fury thrumming along every inch of their brawny , plaid-hung bodies . Her own body chilled to ice , Mariota faced them . " God as my witness , I did not kill him . ' Twas- " " Whore ! See whose blade pierced his heart ! " The nearest man pointed at the dagger hilt thrusting from Hugh 's chest . The dirk 's jewels sparkled , each colored stone screaming her guilt . " Think you we do not have eyes ? " " And lo ! See the handprint on her cheek , " another yelled , seizing her arm . " They fought and she slew him in his sleep ! " A third man spat on the floor . " Hear me , you err ... " Mariota protested , but her tongue proved too thick , the agony in her head and arm too laming . With the last of her strength , she jerked free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save a thin smirr of rain . Elizabeth Paterson may well have been a moonbeam- a figment of Mariota 's imagination . But the blade lodged in Hugh the Bastard 's heart was real . And it was hers-as all at Drumodyn knew . She knew she was innocent . And that Hugh the Bastard was a bastard in more ways than one . A murrain on the man and all his perfidy ! Her peace so won , she offered her arm to the guard who 'd seized her only moments before , let the fire in her eyes dare him into escorting her from the chamber . Mariota of Dunach , proud if misguided daughter of the far-famed Archibald Macnicol , would be double damned if she 'd tremble and cower before any man . And she 'd be thrice cursed , and gladly , if ever she fell prey to love again . " Pigs will sing from trees the day I take a wife . " His mind spoken , Kenneth MacKenzie glanced around the dais table of Eilean Creag Castle 's great hall , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least , a companionable grunt to acknowledge the wisdom of his views . He received neither . Worse , he was almost certain he 'd caught one or two looks of pity . Having none of that , he fixed his gaze on the high , vaulted ceiling . Just long enough to swallow the snort rising in his throat . Dear to him or nay , the menfolk of Clan MacKenzie had addled wits when it came to the lasses . He knew the dangers . Not that he ne'er appreciated the amiable sweetness of soft , well-rounded and acquiescing females . Their warm loveliness and other such intoxicating accoutrements . He relished suchlike indeed . But only with a good measure of caution and when mutual need and satisfaction could be assured , hearts and emotions unfettered . A wife was a wholly different matter . And utterly out of the question . " Singing pigs ? And in trees ? " Elspeth , Eilean Creag 's female seneschal shook her gray head as she plunked down a platter of oatcakes in front of him . " Tut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . " The only woman in the hall this early of a morn , and the most free-spoken one at that , she dusted her hands on her skirts and looked at him , her merry eyes displaying how little she thought of his declaration . Her certainty that he 'd unsay the words . But Kenneth made no reply . Nor did he regret the sentiment . Indeed , were it not for the respected old woman 's bustling presence , he would have spoken more boldly . Told every gog-eyed , woman-crazed fool who called the loch-girt castle their home exactly what he thought of their jabber . As it was , he simply pressed his lips together and reached for an oatcake . Not that the sternest look he could muster or even stuffing his mouth with Eilean Creag 's finest baked delicacies might spare him the seneschal 's keen-eyed perusal . Or her opinion . " Stranger things than singing pigs have been known to roost in these hills , " she said , proving it . Leaning close , she topped his ale cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And a wise woman knows when to curb her tongue , " Duncan MacKenzie , the Black Stag of Kintail , declared from his laird 's chair at the head of the high table . " She knows , too , when men wish to be left alone . " ( Continues ... )
