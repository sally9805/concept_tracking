Chapter One For the first time since takeoff , Rayford Steele had second thoughts about his and Abdullah Smith 's passenger . " We should n't have brought her , Smitty , " he said . He stole a glance at Abdullah behind the controls . The Jordanian shook his head . " That 's on you , Captain , I am sorry to say . I tried to tell you how important she was to Petra . " The darkness enveloping only New Babylon , but visible from more than a hundred miles , was unlike anything Rayford had ever seen . By the time Abdullah initiated the descent of the Gulfstream IX toward Iraq , the clock read 1200 hours , Palace Time . Normally the magnificent structures of the new world capital gleamed stunningly in the noonday sun . Now a stark and isolated column of blackness rose from New Babylon 's expansive borders into the cloudless heavens as high as the eye could see . Chang Wong was Rayford 's mole inside the palace . Trusting the young man 's assurances that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traded glances with Abdullah as he guided the craft into the dark from the whiteness reflecting off the desert sand . Abdullah flipped on his landing lights . Rayford squinted . " Do we need an ILS approach ? " " Instrument landing system ? " Abdullah said . " Do n't think so , Captain . I can see enough to fly . " Rayford compared the freakish darkness to the beautiful day they had left in Petra . He peeked over his shoulder at the young woman , whom he expected to look afraid . She did n't . " We can still turn back , " he said . " Your father looked reluctant when we boarded . " " That was probably for your benefit , " Naomi Tiberias said . " He knows I 'll be fine . " The teenage computer whiz 's humor and self-confidence were legendary . She seemed shy and self-conscious around adults until she got to know them ; then she interacted like a peer . Rayford knew she had brought Abdullah up to speed in computer savvy , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights went out in New Babylon . " Why is it dark only here ? " Naomi said . " It 's so strange . " " I do n't know , " Rayford said . " The prophecy says it affects ' the throne of the beast , and his kingdom became full of darkness . ' That 's all we know . " Rayford 's every visit to Petra had found Naomi growing in influence and responsibility among the Remnant . She had emerged early as a technological prodigy , and as she taught others , Naomi had become the de facto head of the vast computer center . Quickly rising from go-to person to the one in charge , she 'd finally become the teacher who taught teachers . The center that had been designed by Chang 's predecessor , the late David Hassid , was now the hub that kept Petra in touch with more than a billion souls every day . Thousands of computers allowed that many mentors to keep up with Tsion Ben-Judah 's universal cyberaudience . Naomi personally coordinated the contact between Chang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having her join the flight to rescue him from New Babylon had been Chang 's idea . Rayford had initially rejected it . He had enough trouble assigning himself the task of traveling more than seventy-five hundred miles from San Diego to Petra , then having Abdullah fly him the last five hundred miles to New Babylon . Combat-trained George Sebastian was better suited , but Rayford thought the big man had been through enough for a while . There was plenty for him to do in San Diego , and anyway , Rayford wanted to save George for what Dr. Ben-Judah called the " battle of that great day of God Almighty , " now less than a year off . Mac McCullum and Albie , stationed in Al Basrah-little more than two hundred miles south of New Babylon-stood ready . But Rayford had other things in mind for them . Rayford 's son-in-law and daughter , Buck and Chloe Williams , both wanted in on the extraction of Chang from the enemy lair-no surprise-but Rayford was convinced Buck would soon be more valuable in Israel . As for Chloe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . And somebody had to be there for little Kenny . " Store and grab all the equipment you need while I 'm en route , Chang , " Rayford had said , the phone tucked between his shoulder and ear as he packed . " Smitty and I will come get you in a couple of days . " Chang had explained that the job was too big and that he and Naomi working together could get him out of there that much faster . " I do n't want to miss a thing . She can help . I want to be able to monitor this place from anywhere . " " Do n't worry , " Rayford said . " You 'll get to see her face-to-face soon enough . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Her father is one of the Petra elders , you know . " " So ? " " Only the two of them are left in the family . He 's very protective . " " We both have too much work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not kidding , Captain Steele . Please bring her along . It 's not like I have n't seen her on-screen already . " " So , what do you think ? " " I told you . We have a lot of work to do . " Rayford felt a tug on the back of his copilot 's chair as Naomi pulled herself forward . " Can Mr. Smith see to land ? " " Not sure yet , " Rayford said . " It 's as if someone painted our windows brown . See if you can raise our boy . " Chang was to be sure the New Babylon runways were clear , but he could n't talk by phone Tim LaHaye &; Jerry B. Jenkins 5 from there for fear someone would overhear . Naomi pulled a small , thin computer from an aluminum box and attacked the keys . " Avoid runways 3 left and 3 right , " she said . " And he wants to know which you choose so he can be there to meet us . " Rayford glanced at Abdullah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell him the tower is closed , and it 's not like we were going to announce our arrival anyway . We ca n't see which runway is which from up here , so he 's going to have to give us coordinates and- " " Hold on , " Naomi said , keyboarding again . " He 's attached everything you need . " She passed the machine to Rayford and pointed at the attachment . " It is voice activated . Just tell it what you want . " " It 'll recognize my voice ? " Rayford said , studying the screen . " Yes , " the computer intoned . Naomi chuckled . " Attachment , please , " Rayford said . A detailed grid appeared with an aerial view of the New Babylon airfield . " I 'll set the coordinates for you , Smitty , " Rayford said , reaching to program the flight management system . " This thing will do everything but cook a meal for you , Captain Steele , " Naomi said . " You have an infrared port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Abdullah pointed to a spot on the control panel . " Here , " Naomi said . " Let me . " She leaned over Rayford 's shoulder and pointed the back of the computer at the port . " Ready to land , Captain ? " she said . " Roger . " " Initiate landing sequence , " she said and hit a button . " Runway choice ? " the computer asked . Naomi looked at Rayford , who looked to Abdullah . " Does that thing recognize even my accent ? " the Jordanian said . " Yes , " the computer said . " Congestion on runways 3 left and 3 right . Please select from runways 11 or 16 . " " Eleven , " Abdullah said . " Left or right ? " the computer said . " Left , " Abdullah said . " Why not ? " Abdullah engaged the left autopilot and lifted his hands from the controls . " Thank you , " he said . " You 're welcome , " the computer said . Six minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock in the morning in San Diego , Buck bolted upright in bed . Chloe stirred . " Go back to sleep , hon , " she said . " You stood watch three straight nights . Not tonight . " He held up a hand . " You need your sleep , Buck . " " Thought I heard something . " The tiny walkie-talkie on the nightstand chirped . Sebastian 's telltale code . Buck grabbed it . " Yeah , George . " " Motion detector , " Sebastian whispered . Now Chloe sat up too . " I 'll check the periscope , " Buck said . " Carefully , " Sebastian said . " Do n't raise or rotate it . " " Roger . Anybody else aware ? " " Negative . " " On it . " Chloe was already out of bed and had pulled on a sweatshirt . She unlocked a cabinet , removed two Uzis , and tossed one to Buck as he headed for the periscope next to Kenny 's tiny chamber . He set the weapon on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent to peer into the viewer . As his eyes adjusted to the darkness he was aware of Chloe opening and closing Kenny 's door . Going on four years old , Kenny slept longer but less soundly than he used to . " He out ? " Buck said , eyes still glued to the scope . " Dead to the world , " Chloe said , draping a sweater around Buck 's shoulders . " As you should be . " " Wish I was , " Buck said . " I should think so . " She rested her palms on his shoulders . " What do you see ? " " Nothing . George does n't think I ought to rotate the scope . It 's facing west at ground level . I 'd love to elevate it about six inches and let it give me a three-sixty . " " He 's right , babe , " she said . " You know it 's got that whine when it moves . Anybody out there could hear it . " " I do n't think anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbing his eyes . She sighed . " Want a chair ? " He nodded and returned to the periscope . " Could have been an animal . Maybe the wind . " Chloe pressed a chair behind his knees and guided him into it . " That 's why you should just let me- " " Oh no , " he said . " What ? " He put a finger to his lips and pulled out the walkie-talkie . " George , " he whispered . " Six , seven , eight , nine . Nine uniformed , armed GC directly above to the west . " " Doing ? " " Not much . Kicking at the vents . They look bored . Maybe something caught their eye on the way by . " " Vehicles ? " " I 'd have to raise or rotate . " " Negative . Any more ? " " Ca n't tell from this angle . No more coming past . Only three left in sight now . " " Listen for engines . " Buck sat silent a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And another . " " I hear ' em , " George said . " Must be leaving . Can I come over ? " " Tell him no , " Chloe whispered . What palace personnel Rayford could make out in the eerie sepia-toned landscape through the cockpit window appeared to be in agony . Chang had told him that the people writhed and moaned , but a jet screaming onto the runway also clearly terrified them . They had to think it was about to crash , as some had on runways 3 left and 3 right . It was as if the people had given up trying to see . Anyone near the Gulfstream IX had stumbled in the darkness to get away from it , and now they huddled here and there . " That has to be Chang , " Rayford said , pointing to a slight Asian hurrying toward them and gesturing wildly to open the door . " Let me get that , Miss Naomi , " Abdullah said , unstrapping himself and climbing past her . As he pushed the door open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small group of men and women in dark jumpsuits feeling their way along behind him . " Keep your distance ! " he shouted . " Danger ! Hot engines ! Leaking fuel ! " They turned and hurried away in all directions . " How did it land ? " someone shouted . " It 's a miracle , " another said . " Did you all remember rubber-soled shoes ? " Chang said , reaching to help them off the plane . " Nice to meet you too , Mr. Wong , " Abdullah said . Chang shushed him . " They 're blind , " he whispered . " Not deaf . " " Chang , " Rayford began , but the boy was shyly greeting Naomi . " All right , you two , get acquainted back at the ranch . Let 's do what we have to and get out of here . " " Should I change ? " Buck said when he saw Sebastian in fatigues . " Nah . I always wear these on watch . Let me have a look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise and rotate it , Buck ? " " Be my guest . " " Clear . False alarm . " Chloe snorted . " Do n't be saying that to put me at ease . At least nine GC were out there , and for all we know there were more , and they 'll be back . " " Hey , " Sebastian said , " why not assume the best and not the worst ? " " Maybe I am , " she said . " Priscilla and Beth Ann sleep through this ? " He nodded . " I might not even tell Priss , so I 'd appreciate it- " " If I did n't either ? Makes sense , George . Let the little woman carry on , oblivious to the fact that it 's time to move , " said Chloe . " Move ? " Buck said . " I ca n't even imagine it . " " Then we sit here and wait till they find us , which they may already have ? " " Chloe , listen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at those guys . They were n't even suspicious . They were probably talking about how this used to be a military base . They were n't tense , were n't really looking . They just saw the vents and checked them out , that 's all . " Chloe shook her head and slumped in a chair . " I hate living like this . " " Me too , " Sebastian said . " But what 're our options ? GC found an enclave of people without the mark yesterday in what 's left of LA . Executed more'n two dozen . " Chloe gasped . " Believers ? " " Do n't think so . Usually they 'll say if it 's Judah-ites . I got the impression it was some militia holdouts , something like that . " " Those are the people we 're trying to reach , " Chloe said . " And here we all sit , unable to show our faces , raising babies who hardly ever see the sun . Is n't there somewhere in the middle of nowhere where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The next best thing is Petra , " Buck said . " They know who 's there , but they ca n't do a thing about it . " " That 's starting to sound more attractive all the time . Anyway , what are we going to do about what just happened ? " Buck and Sebastian looked at each other . " Come on , guys , " Chloe said . " You think Priscilla does n't know you 're gone and is n't going to ask where you 've been ? " " She knows I was on watch . " " But you do n't come over here unless something 's up . " " I 'm hoping she slept through it . " Chloe stood and moved to Buck 's lap . " Look , I 'm not trying to be cantankerous . Buck , tell him . " " Chloe Steele Williams is not trying to be cantankerous , " he announced . " Good , " Sebastian muttered . " Coulda fooled me . " Chloe shook her head . " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best things that 's ever happened to the Trib Force . You bring gifts nobody else has , and you 've kept us from disaster more than once . But everyone living here deserves to know what you guys saw tonight . Not telling people , pretending it did n't happen , is n't going to change that we came this close to being found out . " " But we did n't , Chloe , " Sebastian said . Continues ...
