Here 's why I do n't like those lists of children 's milestones : They make parents think that kids develop in a straight line . First one step , then the next , then the next , with never a backward glance . In reality , says Katrina Rees Hughes , play therapist and former coordinator of the Ryerson Early Learning Centre in Toronto , children 's development " is absolutely not linear . " A spiral is closer to the reality . Rees Hughes explains that acquiring any skill hinges on " a very complex interplay . " All aspects of a child 's development - memory , emotional insight , physical maturation , social skills - are used . These , in turn , are affected by what 's actually going on in the child 's world at that moment . This means it 's common for children to temporarily " lose " a skill , ability or level of independence they had apparently already mastered . That 's what happened to Kevin MacLeod . The three-year-old was fully toilet trained , at least by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of diapers and using the toilet consistently . Then his family moved . It was a busy few days , and Kevin 's mother put a diaper on him a couple of times when things got really hectic . Kevin , says MacLeod , " totally regressed and refused to use the toilet . " Three months after the move , he is still in diapers . This is a typical response to such a situation , says Rees Hughes . " A move is a huge stress , " she says . Stressors , she says , " have a significant effect on children in terms of their ability to cope with everyday life . " It takes a long time and endless repetition , Rees Hughes points out , before a new skill - like using the toilet - is fully learned . Until the skill is completely consolidated , a child may not feel up to the challenge when he is also coping with a new stress . When the stress is minor or fleeting - a cold or fatigue from an abbreviated nap - then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , your child will " need " to be carried up the stairs or demand your help getting dressed . When a lot of big changes come at once - a move , a new daycare or sibling - it makes sense that your child may be less independent or less consistent with new skills for a longer period . Think of it as your child 's way of telling you that she needs extra TLC and reassurance right now . MacLeod and her husband , Gary , came to this conclusion . " If he 's not going to use the toilet , you ca n't force him , " says Gary . " We are n't going to take him upstairs 50 times a day to try to convince him . We 'll just let him be for a while . " The MacLeods are sure that as Kevin settles into his new home , he 'll feel ready to give up diapers . Outside Stressors are n't the only factor in children 's regressive behaviour : Some of it is the normal rhythm of development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through , " says Rees Hughes . " I 'm thinking about manners . You wonder if they will ever reach the point when they will say please and thank you without being reminded . And miraculously , they do . But they may get into a different stage later where they get surly and balk against the niceties . " The manners are n't gone , she says - they 've just gone underground for a while . Often these little regressions are actually related to a big step forward on another front . A child whose imagination is becoming more complex and creative , for example , may " lose " her independent sleep habits : Her busy little brain is creating new fears and vivid dreams that worry her at night . Likewise , a four-year-old grappling with issues of power and control may be less co-operative and more out of control than at age three . Angie McLellan has seen this in her four-year-old daughter , McKayla . Like many toddlers , at age two , McKayla used to cry whenever McLellan , a stay-at-home mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " But , says McLellan , " since she turned four , she has started crying again every time I go anywhere . " As McLellan points out , by now McKayla knows that her mom will be back soon , and she stays with her dad , Will . She usually stops crying as soon as McLellan is out the door . So what 's going on ? It seems that at age four , McKayla is able to anticipate missing her mom in a new way . And recently there was a little breakthrough when McKayla actually talked about it . " She told me last week , " But Mommy , I will miss you , ' ' " says McLellan . " And I said , " I know you will , but Mommy needs time to herself or she will get cranky , " and she said , " OK , Mommy . ' ' " The last time McLellan went out , her daughter said , " Mommy , I need a hug and a kiss and I will miss you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will miss you too . Have fun with Dad . " McKayla said , " I will . " And she did , without the tears . While this to-and-fro movement is a normal developmental pattern , sometimes there is cause to worry . " As long as they keep taking that one step forward again , you 're fine , " says Rees Hughes . " But when you see true regression - when they take those steps backwards and they 're not coming back to where they were before - then you should get it checked out . " How long is too long to wait ? That depends on a number of factors . Rees Hughes would be concerned about a child who stopped talking for more than a few days , but a flare-up of separation anxiety following a traumatic hospital stay could take weeks or even months to resolve . The bottom line ? If you 're worried about the changes you see in your child , it never hurts to discuss them with your child 's doctor or a child therapist .
