The thing that started it all was that furry boots were dead . I do n't mean a little dead . One glance at the woman 's shaggy footwear , and it was like , " Where do I send the condolence card for your look ? " Or , " Your look is so quaint ! I have such fond memories of when that was in . " Or , authoritatively , " Somebody get me some yellow tape -- I 'm declaring this a fashion crime scene . " Or -- sniffing the air dramatically and addressing no one in particular --  " Is it just me or does this elevator stink -- of last season ? " The other thing was Carly . She was actually kind of dead , too . She had died this very day , Christmas Eve , one year ago exactly , under circumstances that were still too painful to contemplate . So Caroline did n't contemplate them . Contemplation ? She was n't a fan . Staring in fascinated horror at the furry boots in the last place you 'd expect to find them -- the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Belle Connerie building -- Caroline felt her heart leap and frolic with a jingly little touch of Christmas malice , deep under her fox-trimmed Balenciaga military coat and her blush-colored Chlo tea dress . The BC headquarters was where , just yesterday , Caroline had swept into the building wearing her Mantalini sunglasses and had , personally , gotten a silent nod of approval from the Editrix heading out the door . The Editrix , who was noted not only for running the most exclusive fashion book in the galaxy but for hiding her own aging eyes behind light-expunging discs the size of hubcaps , did not notice just anyone . With a nod from her you could practically launch your own fall line . It was the nod of arrival . This , Caroline thought as she stood smirking next to the lady with the unmentionable footgear , has been a very tough morning . But things are looking up . That assessment turned out to be as horribly wrong as a floor-length denim skirt with a big front pocket for holding your circle-a-word puzzle book . It was wrong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as wrong as the Jaclyn Smith collection from Kmart . The morning had been completely mental . Caroline was in the habit of beginning each day with vigorous exercise : an argument with her mother . La had knocked Caroline out of bed with the usual slightly-too-early phone call and the two had , like a sadistic pair of long-distance workout partners , quickly fallen into the usual pattern of stretching out their vocal cords followed by several reps of angry accusations and a session of emotional kickboxing . Caroline had scored the final points of the fight , as she often did , by reaching down into the past and pulling up the usual dead weight : the subject of Caroline 's father . La never wanted to talk about what had happened to him , and Caroline needed to get in the shower anyway . Conversation over . The whole time she was on the phone Caroline 's face felt as if it had been shrink-wrapped onto her skull by heat lamps . A quick look at the placement of her bathroom creams and essential potions turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished with the small gray and black bottle of Honeythunder moisturizer she had applied to her face right before going to bed , she had put it next to her Buzzfuzz wax-and-razor relief oil . But next to the tube of Buzzfuzz that morning there was a gray and black sample bottle of Verisopht shampoo . The stuff she had put on her face was not moisturizer . It was shampoo . Result : raisin face . Her mother . What had gotten into the woman ? This morning 's fight had really just been a horrible sequel , the Grease 2 of phone calls . The original problem had begun when La had called to discuss the plan for the holidays . She 'd ordered Caroline to guess where La and her boyfriend of the month were going . " Okay , Mother . " Caroline rolled her eyes so vigorously that the motion was nearly audible . " Tasmania . " " Hee hee ! No . " " Reykjavk . " " Uh-uh-uh ! " " Okay , London . " Duh . It was always London when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you eat bangers , like it was some kind of quaint Olde Worlde thing to ingest disgusting fat into your pristine bodily ecosystem . " We thought we 'd try someplace new this year , " La said . " Branson . " " Bransonne ? " said Caroline , her mind scrolling through all the travel magazines she read . New place , she decided : southwest France , maybe ? " Oh Mommy , you know comme j'adore la France ! " " It 's not in France , " said La . " And did you just call me ' Mommy ' ? " Okay , then Switzerland . Caroline hoped it would be the cool part of Switzerland , i.e. , not the German part . Germans always made Caroline think of The Sound of Music , and The Sound of Music made her blood ice over . That scene where the poor kids were forced to wear clothes made of curtains ? Needlessly graphic . " We 've never done Switzerland before , " Caroline said , " but I think it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her mother 's cell phone broke up in a cloud of static . " crackle -- zoorcrackle . " Zoor ? Or Soor ? That sounded almost Dutch -- or , God , no , so much worse !  - -  Belgian . Belgium was afflicted by packs of government bureaucrats , droopy gray skies , and practical footwear . It made Albany look like Ro de Janiero . " Did you say Belgium , Mother ? Can we talk about that a little ? " " **31;489;TOOLONG , crackle -- day , " said Mother 's end of the phone . Caroline brightened . " Branzouri ? " she said . " Is that like Italy ? Oooh , I have n't been skiing in the Italian Alps in years ! Please say we 're going to the Alps ! " " Can you hear me now ? " La said , switching channels . " Loud and clear , " Caroline said . " It 's in Missouri . " " I did n't hear that at all , " Caroline said . " Missouri , " said La . Caroline scrolled through her mental database @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maserati ? Moschino ? Caroline gave up . " I 'm just not getting this word you keep mentioning . " Continues ...
