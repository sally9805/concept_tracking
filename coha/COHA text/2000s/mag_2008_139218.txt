AS FASHION fraternities go , the horn-rimmed hall of fame is pretty impressive . Buddy Holly . Barry Goldwater . Woody Allen . Tina Fey . Clark Kent . Wild Thing Vaughn . They 're all giants in their fields , visionaries with faulty vision , and they all reached the top with their eyes framed in thick , black plastic . Baseball managers are underrepresented in the horn-rimmed hall , because 1 ) few of them have worn the unsubtle spectacles and 2 ) even fewer have been described with the adjectives ( geeky , hipster , iconoclastic ) often attached to those who like their eyeglasses black and bold . But it 's time for Buddy , Barry and Woody to make room for the Tampa Bay Rays ' Joe Maddon . He too is at the top of his profession , having just guided a franchise that had never had a winning record in 10 seasons  --  never won more than 70 games , for crissakes !  --  to a division title in the cutthroat American League East . Maddon has presided over a historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in major league history to win 95 games one season after losing 95 ) that makes him a lock to be AL Manager of the Year . // Maddon 's eyewear is the real deal too . He sports a sleek , 21st-century take on classic horn-rims , a funky pair of Hugo Boss specs that appear to have been swiped from Elvis Costello 's nightstand . His fiance , Jaye Sousoures , picked them out for him four years ago . She simply thought they looked good on him , but they have since added to Maddon 's aura as , in the words of Rays outfielder Rocco Baldelli , " a pretty cool cat . " ( The front office caught on right away , handing out 15,000 replica pairs on Joe Maddon Retro Glasses Night in his first season with Tampa Bay. ) // His multidimensional personality does the same . Maddon is a voracious reader who keeps a wine rack in his Tropicana Field office , bikes five to 10 miles most days and can hold forth on a seemingly endless array of topics : James Michener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes in every American League city , for starters . On an off night in New York City before a crucial September series against the Yankees , Maddon planned not an evening of tinkering with lineups or poring over scouting reports , but of rocking out at a show by the B Street Band , a Springsteen cover band fronted by an old friend from high school . And he keeps things light enough that his team , the sixth youngest in the majors this season , sometimes forgets that the silver-haired man on the top step of the dugout is 54 . Name another manager who has gotten a Mohawk after a game , as Maddon did last month when his players were getting shorn in a show of team unity . " He has the personality of a teenager , " says 24-year-old rotation ace Scott Kazmir . " He fits in well with us. " // Hip is n't the only horn-rimmed trait Maddon has covered . He may not be a nerd , but he has egghead tendencies . Two decades ago , when computers were rarer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laptop and preaching the importance of on-base percentage and statistical analysis as a minor league hitting instructor for the Angels . He can go retro on you too . Though consistently positive with his players and one who rarely raises his voice , Maddon twice benched star-in-the-making 24-year-old centerfielder B.J. Upton last month for not hustling , stating forcefully that the lack of effort was disrespectful to the game . // A nonconformist ? Maddon has little regard for baseball 's managerial book , and he has the bases-loaded intentional walk ( the one he had issued to the Rangers ' Josh Hamilton in August was the first in the AL in 107 years ) , four-man outfields ( he sometimes uses the softball alignment against sluggers like the Red Sox ' David Ortiz ) and unique hitting tips ( he told his switch-hitters to bat righthanded against Yankees righty Mike Mussina ) to prove it . " I get so annoyed when you get around a lot of baseball people and basically all they can do is regurgitate previous thoughts , " Maddon says . " They do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // With all due respect to the Republican presidential ticket , your best chance to see a maverick in action this fall may be to follow the Rays , who will open their American League Division Series on Thursday at Tropicana Field . As if a postseason game at the Trop would n't be novelty enough . " We 've done some unorthodox things around here , " says Tampa Bay reliever Trever Miller . " Now we get into situations where we 're all like , How 's Joe going to handle this one ? We might see something we 've never seen before . " // SOON AFTER he was hired in the fall of 2005 , Maddon papered the Rays ' clubhouse with inspirational quotes from an eclectic collection of thinkers , including UCLA icon John Wooden ( " Discipline yourself so no one else has to " ) , former Fed chief Alan Greenspan ( " Rules can not take the place of character " ) and The Myth of Sisyphus author Albert Camus ( " Integrity has no need of rules " ) . Camus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou Piniella , who jumped ship with a year left on his contract , he seemed to be taking on a Sisyphean task . " There was no trust , no specific plan , " says Maddon . " It had all the symptoms of being a bad organization . " // Maddon was hired by the new front-office triumvirate  --  president Matt Silverman , executive vice president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and senior VP of baseball ops Gerry Hunsicker  --  to be the polar opposite of Piniella , someone with the patience and willingness to teach young players . Maddon certainly had that ; he spent 31 years in the Angels organization as , among other things , a player , scout , roving hitting instructor , minor league manager and major league bench coach . He also impressed the Tampa Bay brass as open-minded and progressive , someone who would embrace the 31-year-old Friedman 's devotion to complex statistical analysis . Even in the 21st century , finding a dugout boss who thinks that way is n't easy . " There are some pretty prominent managers who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1996 through 2004 . " I wo n't mention any names , and some of them are among my better friends , but I just do n't agree with that narrow-mindedness . I think we all have to change with the times . " // Maddon is n't a sabermetrician and does n't have Baseball Prospectus bookmarked , but he knows his way around a stat printout and is adept at the keyboard . In the late 1980s , while he was working as a roving hitting instructor and minor league field coordinator for the Angels , he traveled with an unwieldy Panasonic word processor so he could pound out typewritten schedules and notes for players . ( He 's an obsessive organizer , and the thought of handwritten notices in clubhouses horrified him . ) By ' 90 he had traded in the Panasonic for a bulky 386 laptop , a machine that produced exquisite daily agendas . More important , it also opened his mind to the nascent universe of statistical analysis . Spray charts , batter-versus-pitcher matchups , charts of managerial tendencies  --  at the time Maddon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . // Maddon also began charting stats he invented for Angels minor leaguers such as " jug runs " ( runs that go for the other team 's jugular and pad a small late-inning lead to put a game out of reach ) and kept count of plays that sustain rallies but do n't show up in box scores : runners going first to third , two-out RBIs , hitters who hustle to beat out the back end of potential double plays . They were stats , but not in the sabermetric sense . To Maddon they were quantifiable motivational tools , a way to get players to buy into a deceptively old school offensive philosophy based on situational hitting rather than prayers for three-run homers . Maddon took grief from players and other coaches for being tethered to his computer , but his calculations were little more than new-age methods of teaching timeworn baseball truisms. // Maddon brought his jug runs and spray charts and pesky offensive message to Tampa Bay , and the result this year is a team that plays like an East Coast version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen bases , grounded into the fewest double plays and had the second most walks , behind Boston . " Joe 's brilliance is that he knows what needs to be tinkered with and which deep-rooted fundamentals to leave alone , " says Angels manager Mike Scioscia , who had Maddon as his bench coach from 2000 through ' 05 . " He 's unique because of his ability to be progressive and traditional . " // JOE MADDON was supposed to be a football player . Born and raised in Hazleton , a Pennsylvania coal town 95 miles northwest of Philadelphia , he was a decent basketball player and a standout shortstop and pitcher at Hazleton High . But it was as a quarterback that he set pulses racing . He was known as Broad Street Joe , a reference to one of Hazleton 's main drags ; his teammates also called him Monsignor because , no matter how much they egged him on , they could n't get him to curse . Broad Street Joe was recruited by Princeton and Penn and received a letter from Roger Staubach trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted a football scholarship from a college closer to home , Lafayette College in Easton , Pa. , and became an economics major . // Hazleton was and still is a tight-knit , blue-collar melting pot , a provincial place that once sent more kids into the mines than out into the world . The son of an Italian father , Joe ( who shortened the family name from Maddoninni ) , and a Polish mother , Albina , Maddon grew up in an apartment over his dad 's plumbing shop on a block that teemed with aunts , uncles and cousins . It was a Rockwellian upbringing in its own way , steeped in the importance of family , respect for others and the value of hard work . Maddon , who moved west some 30 years ago , returns to Hazleton to visit family and friends for a week every Christmas . Joe Sr. passed away in 2002 , six months before the Angels won the World Series with Maddon as bench coach . But Albina  --  everyone calls her Beanie  --  still lives in that apartment and works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she has been behind the counter for 50 years . // As a sophomore at Lafayette , Maddon was penciled in at starting quarterback , but he quit the team before the season to concentrate on baseball . He had become a catcher , and in 1975 , after his junior season , he left school to sign with the Angels as a minor league free agent . It did n't take long for his big league dreams to fizzle : In four seasons he failed to rise higher than Class A , batting .267 with five home runs in a total of 170 games . But Maddon made an impression on coaches and teammates in other ways . He had a sharp mind for the game  --  probably , he says , because baseball never came to him as instinctively as football and therefore required more study and interest in teaching methods . He was outgoing and laid-back and genuine , the kind of guy who connected with anyone and everyone . And he was such a good cook that his teammates held auctions for the rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general manager of the Class A Salinas ( Calif . ) Angels , when Maddon was there in ' 77 and ' 78 , " I told anyone who would listen , This guy ca n't play , but he 's going to be a manager some day . " // The Angels released Maddon in 1979 , but the following year they offered him a scouting job , launching his long climb up the organizational ladder . He finally made the majors in ' 94 , when he became bullpen coach under manager Buck Rodgers . By the early 2000s he was a franchise institution , part of the furniture at the Big A , but his mind was wandering . He interviewed for the Red Sox managing job in ' 03 and impressed general manager Theo Epstein , but was passed over for Terry Francona . When the Rays ' job opened two years later , Maddon jumped at it . " I needed this job to get my thinking out ahead of me again , " he says . " When you 're in one job for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like being comfortable . " // HOW MUCH impact does a manager truly have on his team ? Even those who hire and fire them are n't sure . " How much credit a manager should get has always been a mystery to me , " says Hunsicker . " But I can honestly say that Joe has had a bigger impact on this team than any manager I 've been associated with . " // As the losses mounted during his first two seasons in Tampa Bay ( the Rays lost 101 games in 2006 and 96 the next year ) , Maddon concentrated on remaking the clubhouse culture , getting players to buy into the idea that the Trop could be home to a winning team and getting rid of those who did n't . But this year , on the first day of spring training , he told his team he thought they were good enough to make the playoffs  --  that , as pitching coach Jim Hickey puts it , " the scholarship program was over , and it was time to be accountable and productive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he 's so upbeat and positive . He 's a devoted spouter of self-help aphorisms ( " Attitude is a decision ! " ) and screener of inspirational T-shirts ; this year 's model is emblazoned with the bizarre equation 9=8 , a reminder coined by Maddon this spring that nine players working together could bring home one of the majors ' eight postseason spots . And unlike the fiery Piniella , Maddon is a Zen breeze in the clubhouse . With his Renaissance man personality comes a suggestion that baseball , while important , is not a life-or-death affair , an attitude that helped keep a young team loose in the heat of its first pennant race . " He does n't ram things down your throat , " says Kazmir . " He 's always communicating , always teaching , but he 's very easygoing . " He just keeps preaching that we should believe in ourselves . He 's not like any other manager I 've had . " // Maddon , a dedicated oenophile , unwinds after every game with a nice California red in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' This is great . You have to try this Merlot , ' " says Jim Hickey . " I 'm like , ' Yeah , Joe , we just kicked the Yankees ' ass . I 'm going to have a cold beer . ' " ) But Maddon balances that sophistication with a sense that he 's having as much fun on Tampa Bay 's unlikely ride as anyone . On one September road trip the players decided everyone should wear T-shirts bearing designs by ultrahip tattoo artist Ed Hardy on travel days . Veteran outfielder and clubhouse leader Cliff Floyd bought dozens of shirts , and Maddon was among the first to pick one off the rack in the clubhouse . " It had a bull's-eye on it , and it said , truth and faith , " Maddon says . " Those are two pretty good words to put on any T-shirt . "
