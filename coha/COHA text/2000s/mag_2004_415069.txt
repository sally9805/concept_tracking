// Dr. Alice Hamilton always arrived at a factory prepared . She had done her homework well . She knew just exactly what conditions she was looking for , and she had carefully worked out what could be done to improve them . Alice Hamilton was a topnotch factory inspector . Before 1910 many health hazards were part of factory work . A bathtub factory is a good example . Manufacturing bathtubs was extremely dangerous . Even the hardiest of men rarely lasted more than four or five years before severe illness or death suddenly ended his working days . Bathtubs were molded of cast iron . Then , while still red-hot , they were coated with powdered enamel that melted and flowed to form an even coating . This coating hardened to a smooth finish . The powdered enamel contained lead . It was impossible to escape the lead dust . Men breathed it into their lungs along with the dusty air . They ate it on their sandwiches from hands they had no time to wash . They worked six- or eight-hour shifts with no lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken away and before the next red-hot tub appeared , men would take advantage of these free minutes to run to the windows for breaths of fresh air and a few bites of lunch . The lead from which the enamel worker could not escape entered his system every day in a variety of ways , and once there it began to poison him . In some cases symptoms did not appear for a long time , maybe years . In others , only a few months would pass before severe attacks of lead colic would send a worker to the hospital with pain and paralysis . Lead poisoning is one of the oldest occupational hazards , dating back to the days of the Roman Empire . Pliny the Elder included it with the " diseases of slaves . " However , it was not until the late 1800s that increased demand for manufactured goods brought about the large number of factories . By 1910 thousands of men were dying every year of industrial poisoning , with lead poisoning as one of the leading causes . In 1910 , Illinois appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Hamilton was part of that committee , and lead poisoning was her special area of concern . The following year she was asked to undertake the same sort of investigation for the U.S. government . Dr. Hamilton 's reports formed the basis for much of the legislation that was later passed . This legislation granted compensation for illness acquired on the job and for safe manufacturing procedures adopted by factory owners . After laws were passed requiring employers to help pay workmen 's compensation , it was to an employer 's benefit to keep his employees as well as possible . When Dr. Hamilton was asked by the U.S. government to undertake the job of investigating occupational diseases , she decided to devote her life to its study . Because of her work , a new branch of the medical profession , industrial medicine , was founded . Dr. Hamilton did not limit her studies to lead poisoning but became familiar with the causes and symptoms of all the industrial diseases . When the air hammer , driven by compressed air and capable of 3,000 to 3,400 strokes per minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared . Dubbed dead fingers by the workers , it was caused by poor circulation , impaired while gripping the handle of the swiftly vibrating tool to keep it under control . Carbon monoxide poisoning was common in mines , in blast furnace gas in steel mills , and wherever blasting products were used . It was also present where printing was done , the commercial pressing of clothes , and in commercial cooking and baking where gas stoves and ovens were used . Dr. Hamilton found these and many additional diseases during her investigations . The gentle , soft-spoken , diminutive doctor did not wish to cause trouble by her investigations . She always claimed that she was a scientist , not a reformer . Factory owners were not required to admit her to their factories if they chose not to , and many did not . However , many others were genuinely interested in improving conditions for their employees . They welcomed her suggestions and put them into practice . At the close of the First World War , the Harvard School of Medicine added industrial medicine to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Dr. Alice Hamilton became the first woman to serve on their faculty , where she remained until her retirement in 1935 . <p>
