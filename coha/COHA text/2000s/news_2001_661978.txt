The fate of about 235 people who work for other parts of Bridge 's news business remains uncertain . <p> Bridge has already sold off much of its assets , including a $ 275 million deal reached in April that will give Reuters control of a number of Bridge 's financial information assets including EJV , a bond pricing and data service ; Bridge Trading , an electronic trading business , and eBridge , an online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset remaining to be sold is Telerate , a bond information service that Bridge bought from Dow Jones . Weiden said the company was discussing the sale with a potential buyer , but he declined to provide further details . <p> Bridge filed for bankruptcy protection in February after failing to reach an agreement with its creditors on new financing . The company grew rapidly over the past several years through acquisitions , but it faced difficulty integrating its businesses and dealing with customer complaints about billing glitches . <p> &gt;+++++ Federal judge rules Ohio journalists need n't reveal sources <p> CINCINNATI ( AP ) - A federal magistrate has ruled that an editor and a former reporter for The Cincinnati Enquirer do not have to identify confidential sources used in stories about the Chiquita banana company that the newspaper later renounced . <p> Cameron McWhirter and David Wells can invoke an Ohio law that allows reporters to protect the identities of confidential sources for news stories , Magistrate Jack Sherman ruled Aug. 7 . <p> The newspaper published stories in 1998 that criticized Chiquita Brands International Inc. for alleged improper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company on its front page , renounced the stories and paid Chiquita $ 14 million . <p> A former Chiquita lawyer , George Ventura , had asked Sherman last month to order the two journalists to discuss Ventura 's role as a confidential source for the stories . Ventura believes the information is material to a lawsuit he has filed against the Enquirer and its owner , Gannett Co . <p> Ventura argued that the privilege of not revealing sources did not apply because his identity already had been revealed by another former Enquirer reporter , Michael Gallagher . <p> However , Sherman said Ventura could not assume that he was the only confidential source and that a shield law can be waived only by a news person . <p> " We think that the court ruled correctly on the broad issue of who owns the privilege to withhold source identity , " Jack Greiner , attorney for Gannett and the Enquirer , said Aug. 9 . " I think this ruling strengthens the idea of confidentiality . " <p> Ventura 's attorney , Marc Mezibov , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The troubling aspect to this decision is that a ' burned ' source is being prevented from vindicating the promises made to him that his name not be revealed , " Mezibov said . <p> McWhirter , Wells and both companies say they have not identified any confidential sources for the stories about Chiquita . McWhirter and Gallagher reported the stories ; Wells was the editor overseeing their preparation . <p> Wells now writes for the Enquirer 's editorial page . McWhirter is a reporter for another Gannett newspaper , The Detroit News . <p> The Enquirer said it fired Gallagher because it learned he had obtained unauthorized access to voice mailboxes of Chiquita executives , without the knowledge of Enquirer supervisors . <p> Sherman did rule that Wells and McWhirter must answer some questions asked by Ventura 's attorneys . Those include issues of whether Gallagher had authority or direction to use confidential sources and whether there was any discussion of whether it was legal to access voice mails . <p> Ventura 's suit is scheduled for trial in January . <p> He says he is entitled to unspecified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Cincinnati-based Chiquita damaged his reputation and cost him a job as a partner in a Utah law firm . He is now in private law practice in Salt Lake City . <p> A former editor of the Enquirer , Lawrence K. Beaupre , also has sued Gannett , alleging that he was made a scapegoat for problems with the Chiquita stories . The company denies the accusation . <p> &gt;+++++ Journalism class helps Mo . death-row inmate get new trial <p> ST . LOUIS ( AP ) - A group of journalism students secured a new trial for a death row inmate when they uncovered evidence that prosecutors had encouraged another suspect in the case to lie about the severity of his possible sentence . <p> On Aug. 3 , U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple ordered Richard Clay retried in a 1994 killing . <p> The state will appeal Whipple 's ruling , said Scott Holste , Attorney General Jay Nixon 's spokesman . Holste declined to comment further . <p> The new information was discovered by students in Webster University professor Ed Bishop 's journalism class . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I feel that through journalism I can make a difference . Now , there 's proof in front of me that I can , " said Holly Rauch , who got a master 's degree in communications from Webster in May . <p> Clay , 36 , was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to death in the shooting of Randy Martindale . Prosecutors said Martindale 's wife , Stacy , was having an affair with Chuck Sanders , a friend of Clay 's , and hired Clay to kill her husband . <p> Clay insisted Martindale was alive when he and Sanders left the Martindale home the day Martindale was killed . <p> At trial , Sanders told jurors he was headed to prison for 10 years for his role in Martindale 's death . <p> But Sanders told the students that he knew his plea deal called for just five years behind bars - and that prosecutors urged him to mischaracterize his punishment to make his testimony appear more credible . Sanders eventually got a five-year suspended sentence . <p> In his ruling , Whipple wrote that the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disclose details of Sanders ' " flexible or negotiable " plea deal . <p> Prosecutors had argued that they are required only to disclose existence of a plea deal , not its contents - a claim Whipple said " defies Supreme Court authority and common sense . " <p> " The state needed the jury to believe Sanders to convict Clay , " Whipple wrote . " Without Sanders ' testimony linking Clay to Martindale , the state 's case against Clay falls apart . " <p> Prosecutor H. Riley Bock , who tried Clay 's case , was on vacation and could not be reached for comment . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> Rather recommends newspapers for information on stem cells <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - CBS anchorman Dan Rather had some unusual advice for television viewers who want to learn more about stem cell research : read a newspaper . <p> Rather made his recommendation Aug. 9 at the conclusion of CBS ' coverage of President Bush 's speech announcing his decision to allow limited stem cell research . <p> Rather recapped in four sentences what Bush had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very complicated subject . " <p> " It 's the kind of subject that , frankly , radio and television have some difficulty with because it requires such depth into the complexities of it , " he said . <p> " So we can with , I think , impunity , recommend that if you 're really interested in this , you 'll want to read in detail one of the better newspapers tomorrow , " he said . <p> With that , Rather signed off the special report , and CBS began airing the latest edition of " Big Brother . " <p> &gt;+++++ Guide offers media help in covering suicide <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Newspapers can help prevent copycat suicides by avoiding sensationalism and exploring the depth of a victim 's problems , a new guide for the media says . <p> The recommendations , released Aug. 9 , were assembled after an extensive review of suicide coverage and dozens of interviews with reporters and editors . <p> " We 're not saying do n't cover it , " said Kathleen Hall Jamieson , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide . " But there are vulnerable individuals who read and watch news and might be affected by the way in which a suicide is covered . " <p> Research suggests that certain types of coverage are most likely to lead people to identify with victims and take their own lives . <p> The guide urges reporters to refrain from giving graphic details about how a suicide was accomplished . It advises against portraying suicide as heroic or romantic or presenting suicide as an inexplicable act of an otherwise healthy person . <p> More than 90 percent of suicide victims have a significant psychiatric illness , usually mood disorders or substance abuse , often undiagnosed and untreated , the guide says . Reporters are encouraged to ask if the victim had ever received treatment for depression or had a drug or alcohol problem . <p> " Acknowledging the deceased person 's problems and struggles as well as the positive aspects of his/her life or character contributes to a more balanced picture , " the guide advises . <p> Rich Oppel , president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors , welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in formal training or less formal lunchtime discussions before a newsworthy suicide is upon them . <p> " It 's a classic case of attempting to put ethics to work in practical situations , " said Oppel , who is also editor of the Austin ( Texas ) American-Statesman . <p> The recommendations were endorsed by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , Surgeon General David Satcher and other private groups and government agencies . <p> Researchers reviewed every story about suicide during 1999 in the nation 's 10 largest newspapers , as well as the last three suicide stories in the largest 100 papers . Authors then interviewed 60 reporters and 15 editors who worked on those stories . <p> They found a lot of skepticism about the copycat phenomenon - also called contagion , Jamieson said . So the guide begins with a bit of proof : <p> Between 1984 and 1987 , there were a series of people in Vienna who jumped in front of subway trains and killed themselves . Media coverage was extensive and dramatic . Then a campaign began to inform reporters that their reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number of subway suicides dropped by more than 80 percent . <p> The guidelines , which were developed by a panel of experts in behavioral health , suicide and media , were tested in focus groups of reporters before being finalized . <p> The research was conducted by Annenberg , which is based at the University of Pennsylvania , and paid for by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation . <p> On the Net : <p> Annenberg : http : //www.appcpenn.org <p> &gt;+++++ Salt Lake paper alters James Dean photo <p> SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) - A recent edition of The Deseret News , owned by the Mormon church , digitally altered a photo of film icon James Dean to remove the cigarette frequently seen dangling from his lips . <p> The manipulation violated newspaper policy against changing photographs , managing editor Rick Hall said . The paper ran a clarification in its Aug. 9 edition . <p> The picture , which filled nearly a quarter of the front page of the Aug. 3 Weekend section , accompanied a story on a television movie about Dean 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned that the cigarette projecting from Dean 's mouth into the story 's text was too striking a focal point . <p> Most of the paper 's 66,000 subscribers are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , who eschew tobacco use . <p> " We have no apologies about not wanting to have the cigarette dominate the page , frankly less because of ownership than general portrayal of tobacco , " Hall said . <p> The paper does not accept tobacco advertising . <p> Hall and Hughes wanted the staff to find a new , tobacco-free photo but because of a misunderstanding or tight deadline pressures , the photo was digitally altered . <p> " Our policy is very firm . We do n't mess around with the content of pictures , and this went against that . There 's no two ways around that , " Hall said . <p> &gt;+++++ Denver Post wo n't use full name of new Broncos stadium <p> DENVER ( AP ) - The Denver Post plans to call the Denver Broncos ' new home " Mile High stadium " instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The community at large thinks of this as Mile High , new Mile High or the new stadium , " Editor Glenn Guzzo said in Aug. 8 editions . " In this case , the community 's terminology is familiar , positive and clear . " <p> Invesco mutual funds group , which paid $ 120 million for naming rights on the new stadium , said Aug. 8 , " It 's unfortunate that The Denver Post has decided to not accurately report the name . " <p> The stadium opened Aug. 11 with an Eagles concert . The first Broncos ' game at the stadium is a preseason match against the New Orleans Saints on Aug. 25 . <p> Invesco bought the naming rights in January , despite opposition from Denver Mayor Wellington Webb and a majority of fans who attended public forums about the deal . <p> Invesco will pay $ 60 million to the Broncos for advertising inside the stadium . The team is paying 25 percent of the $ 400 million facility 's cost . <p> Invesco is paying another $ 60 million for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to reduce taxpayers ' 75 percent share of construction costs . <p> The Metropolitan Football Stadium District , which oversees the project , estimated the sale of the name will result in savings of $ 61 over 11 years for a family earning $ 31,000 annually . <p> Mile High Stadium will be torn down . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> Evening Post Publishing to buy Berkeley Independent <p> CHARLESTON , S.C . ( AP ) - Evening Post Publishing Co. , owner of The Post and Courier , has agreed to buy the weekly Berkeley Independent in Moncks Corner . No terms were disclosed . <p> The sale is expected to close by the end of August . <p> Independent editor and Publisher Allen Morris said he had a long association with Evening Post Co. and would not consider selling to anyone else . <p> Evening Post owns six newspapers in South Carolina , three in North Carolina , one in Texas and one in Argentina . It also owns 11 television stations , a forestry company and two syndicate feature sales companies . <p> &gt;+++++ Crescent Publishing buys Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crescent Publishing Co . LLC has bought Courier Publications and seven of its Maine newspapers from Dallas-based American Consolidated Media Inc. for an undisclosed amount . <p> The Maine newspapers include six weeklies , a triweekly and a free mailbox weekly . The deal included the Midcoast Telephone Directory and The Republican Journal of Belfast , Maine 's oldest weekly first published in 1829 . <p> The acquisition is the second group of newspapers bought by the Greenville-based company . In April 2000 , Crescent bought seven Mobile , Ala. - area weekly and twice-weekly newspapers . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> INTERNET : <p> Code Red II computer worm affects some AP operations <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - After the original Code Red worm infected about 250,000 computers at its peak last week , its more malicious cousin caused sporadic Internet outages nationwide , including the disruption of some Associated Press services . <p> The Code Red II worm caused AP 's outage and knocked out Internet access for AP employees most of Aug. 8 . It did not affect transmission of AP 's main news and photo services . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers had been infected , but few other firms would venture a guess . Code Red II also leaves a " backdoor " open that a hacker can use to take over the infected computer . <p> A worm is different from a virus because it can spread on its own . Code Red II spreads much more quickly than the original Code Red . A virus needs human intervention to infect other computers . <p> Telecommunications company Qwest reported spotty outages for users of its high-speed Internet service nationwide . Home cable modem systems in Virginia and New York also had slow or no service last week due to the worm . <p> Qwest spokesman Chris Hardman said its users running Cisco Systems ' high-speed modems were affected . Some popular Cisco hardware is vulnerable to the Code Red worms , according to a Cisco advisory posted on that company 's Web site . <p> Microsoft , whose software has the vulnerability that lets the Code Red worms attack , has itself been a victim . The company confirmed on Aug. 8 that some computers running Hotmail - the software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the worms . <p> The worm delayed updates of The WIRE , the AP 's news Web site . It also affected a photo service used by smaller newspapers and several specialized sites , including sites for graphics and census information . The disruptions began at about 4 a.m . EDT Aug. 8 . Most services were restored by early afternoon . <p> John Reid , AP 's director of communications and technology , said all the infected computers had been " scrubbed " and were checked to make certain they were secure . <p> Both versions of the Code Red worm attack only computers running Microsoft Windows NT or 2000 operating systems , with Internet Information Services installed . Microsoft offers a software patch to protect computers from infection . <p> On the Net : <p> Microsoft patch : http : **58;6043;TOOLONG <p> AP 's The Wire : http : //wire.ap.org <p> Cisco Code Red advisory : http : **61;6103;TOOLONG <p> &gt;+++++ Man gets 44-month prison term for Emulex stock hoax <p> LOS ANGELES ( AP ) - Nearly a year after sending the stock of the high-tech firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via the Internet , a 23-year-old man was sentenced Aug. 6 to 44 months in prison . <p> Mark Jakob admitted in December that he issued a fake press release in August 2000 that sent Emulex stock tumbling - costing investors nearly $ 110 million . <p> Jakob was able to send the release through Internet Wire , a Los Angeles company that distributes corporate announcements to news organizations and on its Web site . Jakob had worked for Internet Wire for over a year and had left on good terms the previous week . <p> Jakob stood straight , his hands clasped in front of him , and spoke in a soft voice as he told U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian he had read letters from investors who lost millions because of his actions . <p> " It was not until I saw what some of these investors went through that I realized what I really did cause , " he said . <p> Jakob 's attorney and prosecutors agreed Jakob acted out of panic rather than executed a carefully planned scheme . <p> But Tevrizian said Jakob should pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on investors . <p> Tevrizian waived any fines because of Jakob 's inability to pay . He ordered that Jakob serve three years of supervised release after his prison term and be confined in a prison that has a drug treatment facility . <p> Jakob faced a prison term of up to 51 months for the three counts of securities and wire fraud , all felony offenses . <p> Jakob 's attorney , Joel Levine , said his client was under treatment for depression and anxiety at the time of his crime . <p> Last month , the SEC settled its civil suit against Jakob . According to the agreement , Jakob will turn over the $ 241,000 he made trading Emulex stock , plus $ 97,000 , plus interest , which represents the potential trading losses he hoped to avoid by sending the company 's stock price tumbling . <p> Jakob will also pay a penalty of $ 102,642 . The total represents the amount of money frozen by the government after Jakob 's arrest . That money will be held by the court and paid to defrauded investors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> &gt;+++++ <p> BROADCASTING : <p> New CNN chairman meets with GOP leaders in Washington <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - New CNN chairman Walter Isaacson , aware that his network is viewed warily by many Republicans , traveled to Washington for a series of meetings with GOP leaders . <p> While Isaacson 's representatives characterized the meetings as primarily meet-and-greet sessions , they said he wants to hear directly any criticisms that CNN is unfair to Republican or conservative views . <p> CNN has been knocked on its heels over the past year by the growing strength of competitor Fox News Channel , a network with greater appeal to many conservative viewers . <p> During the week of July 30 , Isaacson met with House Speaker Dennis Hastert , Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott , U.S. Reps . J.C . Watts of Oklahoma and Bob Portman of Ohio , and Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska . <p> The meetings are n't an indication that Isaacson believes CNN 's coverage is unbalanced , CNN spokeswoman Sue Binford said . Although the purpose of the trip was to meet with Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats and plans more sessions with both sides . <p> Roll Call , a newspaper that covers Congress and reported Aug. 6 on the meetings , quoted an anonymous aide to one of the leaders as saying Isaacson asked for advice on how to attract conservatives . <p> Isaacson denied that , and an aide to one of the political leaders who sat in on one of the meetings said he did not hear it come up . <p> " It was very cordial , very well received , " said the aide , who requested anonymity . " It was more of a get-to-know-you session . " <p> Several Republicans have contended that CNN shows a liberal bias in its coverage , perhaps a vestige of network founder Ted Turner 's politics . Fox News Channel chief executive Roger Ailes says so repeatedly , and dubbed CNN the " Clinton News Network " during the last presidential administration . <p> " He 's doing the right thing , " Ailes said of Isaacson on Aug. 6 . " He 's trying to let them know he 's there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real effort to allow the Republicans to have some fair coverage , and now he just has to persuade the people at CNN who have been doing it the other way . " <p> An expert on journalistic ethics said he saw no problem with Isaacson meeting with the political leaders - unless CNN starts pandering to conservatives on the air . <p> " I think Walter should absolutely explain what he 's doing , " said Alex Jones , director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University . " He 's talking about a perception problem and now he 's got another perception problem and he 's got to address that . But I do n't think it means he 's compromised either himself or CNN . " <p> Binford said there 's nothing wrong with CNN 's chief executive meeting with newsmakers . <p> " He would have to sit in a bubble and not meet anybody if we apply a standard of not meeting people that we cover , because we cover everyone , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The founder of the liberal media watchdog group Fairness &; Accuracy in Reporting said that Isaacson 's meetings were " shocking " and " pandering . " <p> FAIR 's Jeffrey Cohen said conservatives believe that by attacking the media they can win softer coverage . By meeting with them , Isaacson is saying " keep beating up on me and we will shift our content even further . " <p> FAIR contends there 's never been a statistical study to back up the view that CNN tilts left . <p> &gt;+++++ CNN to open NYC street-level studio next year <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - CNN will open a street-level studio in the middle of Manhattan , becoming the latest news network to seek a ratings boost from the energy of New York 's sidewalks . <p> The studio is expected to open in the middle of next year in the Time &; Life building , across the street from Radio City Music Hall and just blocks away from the streetside studios of Fox News , CBS and NBC . ABC and MTV have studios overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous success with its " Today " show studio in Rockefeller Center , was quickly emulated . CNN 's move comes just as the network is remaking itself in an effort to reverse a slide in ratings . <p> Walter Isaacson , the former Time magazine editor who recently took the reins of CNN , said Aug. 9 that the studio 's location in the same building as Time would allow more interplay between the two news outlets , which are both part of AOL Time Warner . <p> CNN 's specific plans for the space remain somewhat vague . Isaacson said CNN would consider putting some kind of morning show there , as well as a call-in show and " Greenfield at Large , " a recently launched prime-time show hosted by political commentator Jeff Greenfield . <p> CNN will also launch a prime-time news show this fall with former ABC correspondent Aaron Brown that is a candidate for the street-side studio . <p> CNN , whose main news operations will remain in Atlanta , will also have studio space in the new AOL Time Warner corporate headquarters building which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus Circle . <p> People magazine had originally planned to use the midtown space as a promotional center called Inside People , but the plans never became very firm and were eventually scotched this spring . <p> &gt;+++++ Tribune gets conditional approval to buy Conn . TV station <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - The Federal Communications Commission on Aug. 6 approved the acquisition of a Waterbury , Conn. , television station by Tribune Co. , the communications giant that already owns a Hartford television station and The Hartford Courant . <p> The order allows the transfer of control of Tiberius Broadcasting Inc. and WTXX-TV to Tribune from Counterpoint Communications Inc . <p> But the FCC also gave Tribune six months to sell one of its assets because of a federal rule that prohibits the issuance of a broadcast license to a company that already owns a newspaper in the same media market . <p> The WTXX purchase triggered the rule because Tribune already owns a newspaper in the Hartford market . The ruling could force the company to give up WTXX , unless it sells the Courant , a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise its best effort to sell the necessary assets to come into compliance with the rule , " wrote the commission , which approved the sale 5-0 . The order was dated Aug. 3 . <p> Gary Weitman , a spokesman for the Chicago-based Tribune Co. , said the company was studying its options for complying with the FCC order . <p> However , " We remain hopeful and confident that cross-ownership restrictions will be relaxed , " before Tribune is forced to sell an asset , he said . The FCC is reviewing its rule on newspaper-television cross-ownership . <p> Tribune , which already owns WTIC-TV Fox Channel 61 in Hartford and has been operating WTXX-TV in Waterbury for more than three years , was granted a waiver to acquire the Waterbury station because the station is struggling financially , and the Tribune has pledged to make investments in equipment and in new public affairs programming . <p> A waiver was needed because a federal rule prohibits the same company from controlling two TV stations in the same market , if the resulting acquisition leaves fewer than eight independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned WTIC-TV before it took control of the Courant .
