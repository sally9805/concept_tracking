By the time the beds had been made , the toilets scrubbed , the carpets vacuumed but still stinking of cigarette smoke and french fries , dusk had painted his motel in dingy purple . Tom Jemmett stood at the edge of the swimming pool , inside the chain-link fence . The giant neon arrow was popping and buzzing to life above him . A hot breeze brought his hair up on its short ends and gave him a whiff of his own sweaty armpits . He stared down into the murky pool water at a fuzzy , disintegrating turd left there by those kids in room eight . He had n't even found time to skim the bugs off the water in the last five days . The pool had always given Tom trouble . He 'd have to drain the damn thing now . <br> He left it as it was , turning the Pool Closed sign to face the nearly empty parking lot and padlocking the gate . It was July , 104 degrees that afternoon on the bluffs overlooking the Columbia River in eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , would demand refunds . <br> In the office Tom 's twelve-year-old daughter , Sienna , was wedged into a tight corner between the wall and the battered metal file cabinet . An electric fan blew the heat around the tiny room in slow , side-to-side repetition . He glanced at her and snapped the fan off . <br> " You can come out now , " he said , dropping onto the stool and looking across the counter at the lobby . The plastic tree in the corner needed dusting , and he could smell this morning 's now stale doughnuts , which were drawing flies to the half-round table along the wall . <br> Sienna emerged from the corner , pointing at the television . " Six , " she said . <br> Tom looked at the photo on the news . A woman , bandaged , her face scratched and battered . <br> " Six , " Sienna repeated . <br> He looked more closely and finally recalled the woman on TV . She 'd splattered him with her complimentary morning coffee a few days back because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the volume up to hear that she 'd been mugged while visiting her sister in Portland . <br> " Yup , that 's the woman , " Tom said . Sienna 's memory was extraordinary . She could point out a guest from a year ago and remember the exact room assignment . He wondered , though , if all people were nothing more than numbers to her . Did she remember their hair ? The color of their eyes ? Whether they smiled ? " Serves her right . She was a vile woman , " he said . <br> Sienna did n't seem to hear him . She picked up the glass paperweight on the counter and began running the tip of her finger around its circumference , tracing the vibrant colors beneath its surface . Tom imagined she 'd wear a groove in the smooth glass for the time she spent enamored with it . He opened the daily ledger and checked off the rooms he 'd rented the previous night as having been cleaned and made ready once again . As he jotted notes about broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man lumbered in trailed by a squeaky-wheeled suitcase . <br> " Evening , " Tom said , pushing the ledger aside . <br> " Got a room ? " <br> " Twenty-six , actually . " <br> " Twenty-six , " Sienna echoed without looking up from the paperweight . <br> The man grinned with coffee-stained teeth . " I only need one . " <br> " Pool is closed . " Tom did n't want to be cleaning a room that he 'd given a refund on . <br> " No problem . I have n't got time for swimming , anyway . " He scrawled his name on the registration card that Tom slid toward him . Cologne wafted from the man , musky and thick . When he finished , he paid cash for the room , all the time smiling at Sienna , who acted as though he did n't exist . " Pretty girl you got there . " <br> Tom grabbed the first key that caught his finger , glanced at it , and thought , What a coincidence . He handed it to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parking lot in the corner . " The man was still trying to catch his daughter 's eye . Tom had recently become more aware of how people , men mostly , looked at Sienna . She was tall for her age and slender . She had her late mother 's Latina complexion with eyes so dark they appeared black . <br> " She 's quiet . Wo n't say hello , " Tom said . <br> With a polite nod , the man was out the door and on his way , his wheeled suitcase skipping behind him on the cracked sidewalk . <br> Tom read the man 's name on the registration card : Carl Warren of McCall , Idaho . From the looks of him , his tie and pressed trousers , Tom concluded he was a salesman . He turned to Sienna . Wanted to suggest that she say hello when people address her , but why would she start now ? <br> Tom had checked in two more guests when Lauren Kent showed up shortly after eight o'clock and dropped a bucket of fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , accepting a rushed peck on the lips . Lauren , a compact woman with the strength of a man , smelled like antiseptic soap . " I was n't sure if we 'd see you again . It 's been . . . what . . . a week ? Ten days ? " <br> " I did n't think you 'd be in the mood to cook . " She brushed wisps of red hair off her sweaty face and her flat green eyes met his . " Not in this heat . " <br> " I 'm never in the mood to cook . Heat or otherwise . It 's nice to see you again , though . " <br> Lauren studied Tom , giving him her full attention and a warm , engaging grin . " If you were n't so damn good-looking I might be able to stay away for good . " <br> " Is that your goal ? To stay away ? " He did n't know why he was making an issue of her long absence . He rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded he consider marriage , an idea too remote and raw to imagine . But still , he needed a little more from a girlfriend than dropping by unannounced every seven to ten days . A little more regularity , consistency . He needed the female company to help him remember the important things in life . <br> " Hardly . But you do need an air conditioner . At least turn on the fan . " Lauren did n't wait for Tom to do it , but rounded the counter and clicked it on with a jab of her finger . <br> Sienna froze as the air rushed over her bare shoulders . <br> Tom turned it off again . " You know she does n't like the fan . " He began placing napkins on the counter . <br> Lauren watched Tom without commenting , then her eyes drifted to Sienna . " Do we have to eat out here ? " She gestured at the lobby and the large windows facing the parking lot and the highway beyond . The dimly lit units opposite the pool stood silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the apartment where there 's a little privacy ? " <br> " It 's a mess back there , " he warned . " Spend all day cleaning other people 's shit and I ca n't get to my own place . " <br> " Shit , " Sienna said , pulling the lid off the bucket of chicken . <br> Lauren scooped it away from her before the child could grab a piece . <br> Tom halted in the middle of restacking the napkins and looked at his daughter . He turned to Lauren . " She always tricks me into thinking she 's not paying attention . " He looked at Sienna again . " That 's not polite and I should n't have said it . Do n't use that word . " <br> Sienna 's gaze passed right through him . <br> " How are the dogs ? " he asked Lauren as he set the night bell on the counter . She was right ; eating in the lobby afforded them no privacy . He started for his apartment through the door at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Wednesday . Dogs on Mondays , Tuesdays , and Fridays . " <br> " How are the cats , then ? " <br> " Missing all their little testicles . That 's how . " <br> " You ever get tired of taking care of people 's animals ? " Tom found a sour sponge in the sink full of dishes and wiped the stickiness off the dinette table in his cramped kitchen . <br> " Sure , " Lauren said . " Although , today we had a cat with a perforated diaphragm . That was interesting . Was shaken by a dog ; lucky to survive . " <br> Tom did n't say what was on his mind straight off . She scared him a little , Lauren . Ever since she kicked his ass at pool the night they met . He was a master with a cue stick and used to being the victor , but she 'd surprised him . They 'd bet a beer and when he paid up , she swallowed it down within two minutes and ordered another one on his tab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he got away from his motel so infrequently . They 'd been through the topic of living arrangements before . But the last time was months back . He opened the fridge and handed her a Henry 's beer . <br> " Could move in together , " he said . He was n't sure he really wanted that , but he knew she would n't agree to it , anyway . <br> " How do you figure ? " Lauren splayed her fingers , sweeping her hand widely at the single-bedroom apartment crammed with odd piles of paper and scraps of plastic . Buttons littered every surface , tiny shirt buttons , large coat buttons , yellow buttons , brown buttons , green buttons . Some were stacked in neat rows along the edges of the furniture , some displayed in geometric patterns , all sorted by color and size . There was a red nylon sleeping bag flung across the sofa where Sienna slept when she finally got tired of whatever had gripped her attention during the day . <br> " Sienna 's a bit of pack rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This button phase will pass . " He turned to his daughter , who was cramming a drumstick into her mouth , grease oozing over her chin like a toddler . " You 'd pick up your stuff , would n't you , Sienna ? " <br> The child said nothing , and Lauren nodded as if she 'd made her point . <br> " I 'd suggest my place , but that would n't be practical with trying to run a motel seven miles away . Besides , Rocket is too crowded for a guy like you . " <br> Tom believed Lauren was grasping for excuses now . Rocket was an eight-block stretch along Highway 14 , with a school , a post office that doubled as the newspaper office for The Rocket Rocket , an IGA , and three bars . He imagined Lauren 's reluctance had a little to do her with snobbish sense of style and design , evident in her carefully renovated bungalow , a place that set him on edge because he was afraid to touch anything , and a lot to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning , but over the months her interaction with the child had turned to curt little statements spoken loudly , as if Sienna were deaf . They 'd only been dating about eight months , but Tom had hoped that having a woman around might be good for Sienna . Lauren and Sienna 's relationship had been more disappointing to him than he 'd been willing to admit , and perhaps that was why he was pushing the issue . Some misguided hope that it would get better if they spent more time together . Wiping Sienna 's chin with a napkin , he wondered if he even liked Lauren anymore . Maybe he should n't be seeing other people . Being tied to a business like his was n't exactly conducive to meeting women or having a rich and varied love life . <br> " How long have we been dating ? " he asked against his own better judgment . <br> Lauren sighed . " Can we talk about this later ? " <br> " Later , when ? " <br> " Just later . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stared at the ceiling . A note lay on the pillow next to him , but he did n't pick it up . He 'd dreamed of Maria again . Dreamed she was still alive , still lying next to him in this bed . He 'd reached an arm around her shoulder and cupped her small breast in his hand , where he held it like some glorious treasure . The memory caused an ache in the center of his chest . Had it been Lauren 's breast he 'd caressed in the night , believing it was his dead wife 's ? <br> Tom became suddenly aware of the low rumble of a man 's voice . He flew from bed , turning a circle in the tiny bedroom as he searched for his pants . Dressing in haste , he whisked up the note and rushed out into the living room , where he found the door between his apartment and the lobby standing open . <br> His salesman guest , Carl Warren , was talking to someone . Tom searched for his daughter , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> In the lobby , Tom found the coffee made , the doughnuts set out for his three guests . " Sienna ? " he called . " Sienna ? " <br> " She 's right here , " Carl Warren said , pointing at the stool behind the counter . Tom 's daughter was carefully perusing the pages of a large book with bright pictures . " She 's reading about Africa . I sell educational books for early readers . " He pulled out a business card and handed it to Tom . " National Foundation for Literacy , " Carl said . " Mostly I visit rural areas that do n't have access to what urban kids have . " <br> Tom let his breath out , aware for the first time that he 'd been holding it . He took the business card , but did n't read it . Instead , he opened the now-crumpled note from Lauren . <br> Sleep in , baby . I 'll take care of the coffee &amp; doughnuts today . Luv , L. <br> He blinked at the words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that split second that Sienna had done the coffee . A silly idea . <br> " Is it okay if she keeps it ? " Carl asked . <br> " Huh ? " <br> " The book . Can she keep it ? No charge . " <br> " Oh . " Tom watched Sienna a moment . " It would . . . she does n't . . . " <br> " Hey , it 's okay if she just wants to look at the pictures . It 's a children 's book , has lots of pictures . It 's okay . " <br> Tom 's stomach sank . Rare as these moments of understanding from complete strangers were , they still happened often enough that Tom believed he should know how to handle them . Should be used to them . But he never got accustomed to the unexpected urge to break down and cry . And he resented that a stranger 's kindness could make him feel that way . <br> " She 's a special girl . I do n't mean any harm . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren said quietly . The man mercifully did n't look Tom in the eye , but kept his gaze on Sienna , who seemed enchanted with the book . <br> " Thank you , " Tom croaked . <br> Continues ...
