Our Post writer Doug Zipes and his wife , Joan , report on the safari of a lifetime at a game reserve in Kenya Continued from March/April 2006 <p> The road from the camp was a pock-marked hard dirt ribbon threading into the hills . Game was everywhere . Friends mingled with friends , so all of the herbivores grazed together  --  horned animals of all kinds , along with giraffes , wildebeests , and zebras  --  with no carnivore in sight . The latter stayed within their own groups : cheetah families , a pride of  --  imagine !  --  17 lions , and a lone leopard in a tree . A small group of hyenas emerged from the bush , muzzles and necks fleshly stained red and abdomens bulging from their recent breakfast . <p> This morning , instead of tracking game in the lowlands , we drove to the higher ridge where a Masai village sat . The chief greeted us , collected $20 apiece and , in surprisingly good English ( learned solely from tourist interaction ) , delivered a brief history of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masai , displaced from living in the park , grazed cows and goats on the outskirts . The tribe was totally self-sufficient , living on the meat and milk of its herds . Periodically they bled the cows , draining off a pint of blood with a hollow stick that punctured a jugular vein , and drank it mixed with milk . They grew no crops and ate very few green foods . Each morning young boys and men dressed in florid red cloths easily spotted in the drab grass herded the flocks to the lower pastures to graze . <p> The chief led us through an opening in the bramble fence enclosure , and we gingerly tiptoed around and over cow dung that filled the space . Every evening the animals supporting the Masai existence and accounting for their wealth were herded into this ring for protection . Calves and baby goats were sheltered in the front rooms of tiny domed three-room huts in which the Masai family lived . The other two rooms were the father 's sleeping cubicle aid a smaller one for the mother , who slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed the walls and roof , with a hard-packed dirt floor . Body heat from the young animals and a central fire whose smoke billowed through a hole in the roof kept families warm . No hot-water bottle or hot tea delivered by an attendant here ! <p> Clouds of flies settled on faces , eyes . and clothes . Electricity and running water did not exist . Streams or shallow wells provided drinking water . At this hour , the only males left in the camp were the chief and two old men , one of whom showed us how they made fire by rubbing two sticks together , exactly as I had done 50 years earlier to earn my Boy Scout 's merit badge ! <p> Women  --  alone or carrying babies-stood watching us . Then they grouped together and chanted a Masai welcome . Several women were building a new hut , a chore deemed unworthy of a Masai man . Children of all ages ran about in various stages of dress.or undress . Two older boys engaged in a shoving match until they were separated by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . <p> Kicking and scraping the thick crust of dung from our shoes , we toured the village , bought a few hand-beaded trinkets , and reboarded the Land Rover to return to our camp for a thorough hand-washing and shoe-cleaning before lunch . We ate and , after a swim and a nap , left for the afternoon drive in the cool of early sunset . Animal life , slowed during the heat of the day , emerged from dense foliage , thickets and trees , foraging for food . A large herd of elephants blocking the road were in no hurry to let us drive through . The herd was intent on tearing up great hunks of grass by the roots , shaking the dirt off so as not to wear down their teeth , and swallowing basketball-sized clumps . The biggest elephant , the grand dame matriarch , eyed us warily and trunk-guided her year-old baby son beneath her belly . He suckled for a few minutes and emerged from her protection to confront our vehicle , Barely three feet tall , the little guy mock-charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing at us . He then ran back to Mother , seemingly quite proud of his show of bravado , so much so that he repeated it , making certain the entire herd of ten witnessed his bravery . Then , once again , he scurried beneath his mother 's huge flanks while she stood impassively , or perhaps with a slight smile on her face . Do elephants smile . I wondered ? <p> The wildebeests were migrating south in search of fresh tender grass and water from the Masai Mara in Kenya to its continuation , a plain called the Serengeti , once it crossed the Tanzania border . Great herds of wildebeests stood grazing , while others formed an endless serpentine line resembling a dark smudge stretching across the horizon . As we approached , the smudge became defined , first as dots and then as individual animals walking in single file , tall to head , almost in each other 's footsteps . A narrow path worn into the plain testified to their orderly methodical march . The strongest led while the elders struggled to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of each other , hugged close to their mothers ' sides . Because of relatively poor eyesight , wildebeests often commingled with zebras to take advantage of the zebras ' visual acuity . Predators were all about , waiting for an opportunity to strike . <p> Suddenly the line halted and the animals milled around nervously . Were lions close by ? No , our guide said , it was the Mara River . As the vehicle drew closer , we could see the lead animals dancing agitatedly on the shore , edging closer to the water , then back , trying to galvanize sufficient courage to cross the wet chasm blocking their journey . <p> And , indeed , courage was needed . because in the river lay a dozen half-submerged floating logs with only eyes and snouts showing . These huge river crocodiles sensed dinner was approaching , and they only needed to wait for home delivery on the hoof . A two-ton hippopotamus walked the river bottom nearby , observing an uneasy truce with the crocs . Mean-spirited and unpredictable , these huge herbivores that protected their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more human deaths in Africa than any other animal . <p> Finally the lead animal on a rear leg while another bit down on its muzzle , dragging the zebra underwater . The river churned as the animal fought to get free . But it could not escape the powerful jaws dragging it into deeper water , where it soon drowned . Other crocs converged and began ripping off chunks of flesh by grabbing hold . twisting and rolling over and over in the ever-reddening water . An eagle flew to the river bank , waiting for a chance to dive into the frenzy for a piece of meat . When it appeared that most of the crocs were focused on the zebra carcass , the migration restarted . the line once again moving after the brief , but deadly , interlude . Sacrificing one zebra was the price for crossing the river.this time . <p> The rest of the afternoon yielded little game , and our group grew weary of bouncing over rutted roads in search of an elusive large herd of elephants . it was remarkable how these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide pulled to a stop and turned off the motor to " listen to the bush talking . " Faintly , we heard low-pitched rumbling sounds and sharp clicking noises in the distance . Staring hard into the dense foliage , we saw nothing but shadows . <p> " Elephants , " the guide whispered . " talking to each other . " <p> " And the clicking sounds ? " I asked . <p> " Young males sparring , tusk on tusk . " The guide started the engine and backed the Land Rover 50 yards further down the road . " They will cross in front of us , " he said under his breath . " Just wait . " <p> We sat five minutes , ten , slapping at mosquitoes and flicking flies In the gathering gloom , listening to the bush . Birds sang , katydids chirped , and the rumbling noises intensified . Suddenly , we saw a huge shadow take solid form . Not ten yards in front of our vehicle the matriarch elephant began to cross the road , a 31/2-ton giant not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost like any pedestrian crossing a street , and then spied our vehicle . With an ear-piercing shriek , upraised trunk , and flapping ears . the mammoth bundle of fury charged ! No three-foot baby this time ! My hands instinctively flew to protect my face as I was certain she would overturn the Land Rover and trample us all . But just inches from the vehicle , she halted , backed away , and repeated her ferocious attack , head high . Again the behemoth stopped inches from us . Three times she repeated her angry assault , each attack sending our hearts racing , but each stopping just short of us . <p> Apparently satisfied that we represented no threat ( and that she had scared us Into submission ) , she slowly crossed the road , followed by the other members of her herd , We sat spellbound for the next ten minutes as 35 gray beasts of all sizes walked in front of us , behind us , and alongside , added feet slapping quietly on the road . We were surrounded by tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat , not one charged , yet all appraised us carefully . When the lengthy procession finished , fading again into the shrubs , we turned to each other  --  some still white-faced , hearts thudding . Our guide was smiling . <p> " Oh , they never actually complete the attack , " he said , only after the last of the phalanx had passed . " In my 24 years in the bush , I have never seen it happen . Just a mock display to see if you 'd run . When they really intend to charge , their ears flatten and there is no warning , just a speeding missile coming at you . " <p> " Why did n't you tell us that before ? " I asked . <p> " And spoil the fun ? " he replied . <p> Sunlight was fading rapidly in the drive back to camp . Giraffes swayed gracefully in the golden light , stretched necks bobbing from side to side and casting elongated shadows while grazing on the treetops . They walked with a unique sort of sashaying gait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each step . Only the hyena walked similarly . I thought about the giraffes ' blood pressure , 2 1/2 times that of a human , required to transport blood up those long necks , and the 25-pound heart needed to generate it . One at a time they stopped to drink , carefully spreading front legs wide to reach the water while others stood guard . One slip and the lanky giants might not be able to get up again . <p> A male ostrich dashed in front of the Land Rover , shook its wings and danced across the road , trying to capture a female 's attention . In the bush , a serval , looking much like a displaced house cat , chased a rabbit bigger than itself . <p> At the next turn , animals on both sides of the road froze and stared . Ahead , walking directly ill our path with the same insouciant attitude , was the lion pair , owning the road . Our vehicle braked to a stop , and we sat holding our breaths while the brothers passed so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat mesmerized , but these kings ignored us like so much flora . The lords of the land meandered into the bush when suddenly a 1,500-pound water buffalo came over the rise , almost colliding heads with them . For just a split second , the threesome stood still , taking stock of each other . Then , head lowered and fearsome horns thrust forward , the buffalo charged the pair . Not about to wrestle with a powerful male buffalo in its prime , the royals fled like vanquished rulers , tails between legs . <p> After dinner we sat in deck chairs at the front of our tent , recalling the days adventures . The night sky was lit up  --  exploding fireworks by the millions of stars . Venus outshone all other planets , appearing close enough to pluck like low-hanging fruit . Across the sky sped a satellite . And in the distance , on the other side of the electric fence , Africa continued its cycle of life and death as it had for countless millennia . We could only hope the cheetahs had found dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shakes hands with a chameleon . <p> <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Douglas P.
