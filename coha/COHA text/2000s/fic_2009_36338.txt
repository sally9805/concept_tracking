" I want you to open the door for me . " <p> Only silence . <p> " Look through the peephole , " I said . " I 'm not a cop . I 'm an assistant district attorney . " <p> I stepped back and squared off so the woman inside the basement apartment could check me out . The hallway and staircase had been cleared of men in uniform , including the detail from Emergency Services poised to knock down her door with a battering ram , who were there when I arrived at the scene a short while ago at one o'clock in the morning . <p> I did n't hear any sound from within . No sense of her movement . <p> " My name is Alexandra Cooper . You 're Tina , are n't you ? Tina Barr . " I did n't say what my specialty was , that I was in charge of the DA 's Office Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit . The police were n't certain she had been assaulted by the man who had earlier invaded her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details to me if I could gain her confidence . <p> I moved in against the metal-clad door and pressed my ear to it , but heard nothing . <p> " Do n't lose your touch now , Coop . " Mike Chapman walked down the steps and handed a light bulb to the rookie who was holding a flashlight over my shoulder . " The money on the street 's against you , but I 'm counting on your golden tongue to talk the lady out so those guys can go home and catch some sleep . " <p> The young cop passed the bulb to Mercer Wallace , the six-foot-six-inch-tall detective from the Special Victims Unit who had called me to the brownstone on the quiet block between Lexington and Third Avenues in the East 90 's . <p> Mercer reached overhead and screwed it in , illuminating the drab , cracked paint on the ceiling and walls of the hallway . " Somebody-most likely the perp-shattered the other one . There are slivers of glass everywhere . " <p> " Thanks , kid , " Mike said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace ? " <p> " We have n't got a homicide , " I whispered to Mercer . " And they sell light bulbs at the bodega on Lex . I do n't know why you think we needed Mike , but please get him off my back . " <p> " Damn , I 've listened to Blondie charm full-on perverts into boarding the bus for a twenty-five-to-life time share at Sing-Sing . I 've seen her coax confessions from the lying lips of the deranged and demented . I 've watched as weak-willed men- " <p> Mercer put his finger to his lips and pointed at the staircase . <p> " Tina , these two detectives are my friends . I 've worked with them for more than ten years . " I paused to cough and clear my throat . There was still a bit of smoke wafting through the hallway . " Can you tell me why you do n't want to open up ? Why it is you wo n't trust us ? We 're worried about your safety , Tina . About your physical condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go up for a break . Get some fresh air . " <p> I stayed at the door for another few minutes and then followed Mike and Mercer to the small vestibule of the building and out onto the stoop . It was a mild October night , and neighbors returning to their homes , walking dogs , or hanging around the ' hood were checking on the police activity and trying to figure out what was wrong . <p> The uniformed sergeant from the 23rd Precinct whose team had been the first responders was on the sidewalk in front of the building , talking to Billy Schultz , the man who had called 911 an hour earlier . <p> " What 's the situation behind the house ? " Mike asked Mercer , as I caught up with them , on their way down the front steps . <p> " Two cops stationed there . Small common garden for the tenants . Back doors from both the first floor and Barr 's basement apartment , but no one has moved since they 've been on site . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not much . Nobody seems to , " Mercer said . He turned to the man standing with the sergeant , whom I guessed to be about forty , several years older than Mike and I. " This is Mike Chapman , Billy . He 's assigned to Night Watch . " <p> Mike worked in Manhattan North Homicide , which helped staff the Night Watch unit , an elite squad of detectives on call between midnight and eight a.m. , when precinct squads were most understaffed , to respond all over Manhattan to murders and situations like this one that the department referred to-with gross understatement-as " unusuals . " <p> " Billy lives on the first floor , " Mercer said . " He 's the guy who called 911 . " <p> " Good to meet you , " Mike said . He turned to me . " What 's her name ? " <p> " Tina Barr . " <p> " She your friend ? " he said to Billy . <p> " We chat at the mailboxes occasionally . She 's a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time gardening on weekends in the summer , so I ran into her out back every now and then , but I have n't seen her much since . " <p> " Lived here long ? " <p> " Me ? Eighteen years ? " <p> " Her . " <p> " Tina sublets . A year , maybe more . " <p> Mike ran his fingers through his thick black hair , looking from Billy to me . " You sure she 's in there ? " <p> " I could hear a woman crying when I first got here , " I said . Whimpering was a more accurate word . <p> " Tina was sobbing when I knocked on her door , " Billy said . <p> " But she would n't open up for you ? " <p> Billy Schultz adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose while Mike scrutinized him . " No , sir . " <p> " Why were you knocking ? What made you call 911 ? " <p> " Mercer gave us all this , Mike . Let me get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , palm perpendicular like a stop sign . " Do n't you want the chronology from the horse 's mouth ? Primary source . Catch me up , Billy . " <p> I had one hand on the wrought-iron railing but stopped to listen . <p> " I 'm a graphic designer , detective . Worked late , stopped off for a burger and a couple of beers on my way home , " Billy said . He was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt . There were smudges of ink or paint on his jeans , too dark in color to be blood , I thought . " It was about 12:30 when I got near the building . That 's when I saw this guy come tearing out the front door , down the steps . " <p> " What guy ? Someone you know ? " <p> Billy Schultz shook his head . " Nope . The fireman . " <p> Mike looked to Mercer . " Nobody told me about that . The fire department got here first ? " <p> " Not for real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed he was a fireman . He was dressed in all the gear-coat , boots , hat-even had a protective mask of some kind on . That 's why I could n't see his face . " <p> " Did you stop him ? Did he talk to you ? " <p> " He flew by me , like there was a forest fire on Lexington Avenue he had to get to . Almost took me out . Even that did n't seem odd until I looked up the street for his truck , but there was n't one around . Just weird . " <p> " What did you do then ? " <p> " I unlocked the door to the vestibule , and as soon as I got inside , I could smell smoke . I could see little waves of it sort of spiraling upward from the basement , " Billy said . " We do n't have a super who lives in the building , so there was no one for me to call . I figured whatever happened had been resolved . By the guy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out , make sure there was nothing still burning . " <p> " Sarge , you want to get me that mask ? " Mercer said . <p> The older man walked to the nearest squad car and reached in for a paper bag while Billy Schultz talked . <p> " I went downstairs first . It was pretty dark , but I could make out a small pile of rubble in the corner of the hallway , a couple of feet from Tina 's door . Nothing was burning-no flames-but it was still smoldering . Kicking off a lot of smoke . That 's when I knocked on her door . " <p> " Did she answer ? " Mike asked . <p> " No . Not then . I did n't hear anything . I figured maybe she was n't home . I ran up to my apartment , filled a pitcher with water and came back down to douse whatever was still smoking . Figured the other firemen must have gone off to a bigger job and that the last one-the guy who almost plowed me down-was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant passed the bag to Mercer , who put on a pair of latex gloves from his pocket before opening it . <p> " It 's when I went downstairs the second time that I heard Tina . " <p> " What did you hear , exactly ? " I asked . <p> Billy cocked his head and answered . " I knocked again , just because I was worried that the firemen might have left her there even though there was still something smoldering in the hallway . She was weeping loudly , then pausing , like to inhale . " <p> " Words , " Mike said . " Did she speak any words ? " <p> " No , but I did . I told Tina it was me , asked her if she was alright . I was coughing myself from the smoke . I told her she could come up to my apartment . " <p> " Did she answer you ? " <p> " No . She just cried . " <p> " How do you know it 's Tina Barr you were talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , at that point-I , uh-I just assumed it , detective . She lives there alone . " <p> " What next ? " <p> " I went home to get a bucket and broom . Swept some of the trash into the bucket to throw out on the street- " <p> Mike glanced at the sergeant . " Yeah , we got it , Chapman . Looks like amateur smoke bombs . " <p> " The sobbing was so bad by then I called 911 , from my cell . Maybe she was sick , overcome by the smoke . I waited out here on the stoop till the officers came . Three minutes . Not much longer . That 's when Tina went berserk . That 's when I knew it was her , for sure . I recognized her voice , when she was yelling at the cops . " <p> Mercer removed a large black object from the bag and dangled it in front of us . <p> " Yeah , " Billy said . " That 's what the fireman had on his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the sergeant said . " Right in the perp 's flight path . " <p> " That 's not department gear , " Mike said . " It 's a gas mask . Military style . " <p> It was a black rubber helmet , with two holes for the eyes , and a broad snout-like respirator that would fit over the mouth , with a long hose attached . <p> " Could n't see a damn thing , " Billy said . " It covered his entire face . " <p> " What did the cops do ? " Mike asked . <p> " I led them down to the basement . They knocked on Tina 's door and one of them identified himself , said they were police . That 's when she started yelling at them to leave her alone . I mean screaming at them . Freaked out . Sounded like she collapsed-maybe fell onto the floor-crying the whole time . " <p> " What makes you think she 's alone in there ? " <p> " We 're guessing , " Mercer said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no struggling , no other voices . But that 's another reason ESU wo n't leave . " <p> Mike started up the front steps toward me and prodded my side with his fingers . I went back in the vestibule toward the basement staircase . <p> " One of the cops told Tina he just wanted to make sure that the fire had n't affected her , " Billy said , drawing a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his smoke-fogged glasses . " Asked her if she could stand up and look through the peephole at his badge , for identification . She went wild . " <p> " What do you mean ? " Mike asked . <p> " Tina screamed at the cop . Told him that 's how the guy got in . The fireman . That he showed her his badge and she opened the door . " <p> " It was the fireman who was inside her apartment ? You knew , Coop ? " <p> " That 's why Mercer called me . We do n't know who the man was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went inside , and what he did to this woman . Okay ? Do n't come any closer , Mike . Let me talk to her . " <p> I walked the short corridor to the rear of the hallway , glass crunching under the soles of my shoes . <p> " Tina ? It 's Alex Cooper . We 're all still here . The police officers wo n't leave until I convince them that you 're unharmed . I 'll keep them outside the building if you 'll let me in for just a few minutes . " <p> " I 'd rank that a toss up , " Mike said . " Ten minutes with you or the quick punch of a battering ram ? Tough call . " <p> " You think this helps ? You think she ca n't hear you ? " I threw up my arms in frustration as I turned to Mike . " Mercer , please take him upstairs . " <p> The men marched back to the first floor as I made another attempt to convince Tina Barr to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the basement now , Tina . The men are all outside . I do n't want them to break down your door any more than you do . But they 're worried that you 've been injured . There was a lot of smoke down here . Can you just tell me if you 're hurt ? " <p> There was no answer for more than a minute . Then a soft voice spoke a word or two , that sounded as though the woman was still sitting or lying on the floor inside . I could n't understand her , so I crouched beside the door and put my ear against it . <p> " Sorry . What did you say ? " <p> " Not hurt . I 'll be okay . " <p> She spoke haltingly , her words caught in her throat . <p> " Tina , are you having trouble breathing ? " <p> No answer . <p> " We can give you oxygen , Tina . Is it the smoke ? Is there still smoke in your apartment ? " <p> " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireman , did you let him come into your apartment ? " <p> She was crying again as she tried to speak . " No , no I did n't let him in . " <p> " But you told the police officer that- " <p> " I only opened the door because he showed me a gold badge and told me there was a fire . I could smell the smoke and then saw it . I believed him . " Tina Barr 's words came out phrase by phrase , embedded in sobs . " He forced his way inside . I did n't let him in . " <p> " You can trust us , Tina . Now you know that man was n't actually a fireman . His badge was n't real . " Mercer had already checked that with the department , and had been telling that to Barr before I got there . " The cops think the man started the fire himself in order to break in to your apartment . " <p> She was taking deep breaths on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to get at what had so far been unspoken . " I work with victims of sex crimes , Tina . That 's all I do . It 's why the police thought I might be able to help . I deal with the most sensitive cases you can imagine , " I said , closing my eyes , which burned from the lingering smoke . " Did this man assault you tonight ? " <p> She coughed again . <p> I did n't know how long he 'd been within the apartment before Billy Schultz saw him running from the building at 12:30 in the morning . <p> " Did he awaken you when he knocked , Tina ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Do you know what time it was when you first went to the door ? " <p> " Five , " she said . <p> " Five o'clock in the afternoon ? " She must have been confused . " Look , I 'm going to have to let the police work on your door , or the back window in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could n't have been inside there that long . " <p> There was a noise before Tina Barr spoke next , as though she shifted her position . She had gotten to her feet , perhaps angered by my comment . I stood up , too , as she pounded on the door . " I know exactly what time it was when the man knocked , do you understand ? It was n't the middle of the night , Ms. Cooper . It was five o'clock . " <p> All the cops and I had assumed the events had occurred within minutes of Schultz 's arrival home . Fast , like most break-ins , and while the smoke bombs were steaming . We were wrong . <p> " I apologize , Tina . That 's even more reason for me to know what he did to you . " I did n't want to suggest the word ' rape ' to her . I needed her to reveal to me what had occurred . <p> " I do n't want to talk to any cops , Ms. Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them go away . " <p> " I 'm alone down here now . The men wo n't come in . " I paused before I spoke again . " I give you my word . " <p> Tina Barr sniffled , then was quiet . I heard the deadbolt turn . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
