<p> Do n't tell Esther Green crime does n't pay . <p> She knows better . <p> Green , whose pearl-colored Cadillac sports the license plate " DTMCDP " ( " Do n't Tell Me Crime Does n't Pay " ) has made a comfortable living by bailing assorted suspects out of jail . <p> Hers is a family business that , like so many others , is often supported by repeat customers . <p> " I call them my people , ' " she said of those she bails out , " because they come back now and then . " <p> Bail agents like Green ( who prefers the term " agent " to " bondsman " ) play a large role in the criminal justice system . They can spring defendants from jail day or night , and are more effective than police in corralling the ones who skip court . <p> They also suffer from an image problem . The industry has been known for some unsavory characters who set up shop , got hooked by a bail jumper , and were gone faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the world out there does n't know anything about the bail bond business , " said Green , a 30-year bail veteran whose downtown Redwood City office is decorated with artwork and family photos . <p> " They think we 're all bald-headed men who smoke cigars and have drawers full of cash , " said the blond , tanned Green . <p> Today , many in the industry are working to improve the sullied image and raise the level of professionalism . Their trade group , the California Bail Agents Association , even adopted a code of ethics . <p> " Agents should endeavor to eliminate . . . any practices which could be damaging to the public or to the dignity and integrity of the bail industry , " according to the code . <p> Alan Davidson , an agent for Bail Bonds Unlimited , is part of the new breed . <p> He stresses customer service at his office across the street from the San Mateo County Jail in Redwood City . Dressed in a crisp shirt and tie , Davidson , 26 , looks like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . <p> " I look at it as a question of , who are you going to leave your money with and who are you going to talk to about your problems ? " he said . " We see everybody . A lot of people in a lot of different professions need bail . It 's not that hard to get arrested . " <p> Indeed . <p> The San Mateo County Jail booked more than 16,600 suspects last year . Santa Clara County last year housed nearly 60,000 men and women in its jails . <p> After an arrest in all but the most serious crimes , a judge will typically set a dollar amount for bail . The amount depends on the crime , anywhere from a few hundred dollars to sums in the millions . <p> If the suspect has the cash , he or she can post it with the court and walk out of jail while awaiting trial . The money is refunded in full if they show up to court as promised . <p> But many suspects do n't have the cash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the court the full amount of the bail if the suspect fails to appear . In exchange , they normally command a flat 10 percent fee of the amount of the bond . <p> If they write a $100,000 bond , they earn $10,000 . In California last year , 1,800 licensed bail agents wrote about 150,000 bonds for a total of $1.2 billion , according to the California Bail Agents Association . <p> But the process involves risk . <p> Before posting a bond , bail agents typically want collateral , usually in the form of house deeds and other hard assets , especially when clients are not always the most upstanding of citizens . <p> They also usually want to know if the accused has firm ties to the area , in terms of a longtime job and extensive family , to try to ensure they wo n't skip town . <p> " When people are in jail , they 'll say anything to get out and promise you anything , " said one downtown Redwood City bail agent . <p> The key , Green said , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for the accused . Bond providers , after all , do n't have to serve every customer who calls . <p> To protect themselves , bond companies run property record searches and can get credit reports 24 hours a day , seven days a week . <p> " You have professional thieves in there , " Davidson said , adding that he tries to size up the person trying to bail out a suspect . " At 2 a.m. , it 's usually the drinking buddy who misses him . " <p> Everyone has a story . <p> On a recent afternoon , a woman walked into Green 's office to bail out her husband 's friend . The man was in jail  --  again  --  because of a drug problem . <p> The woman offered to secure the $20,000 bail with her husband 's mother 's home . But Green decided she did n't need it  --  because she knows the suspect , and the friends trying to bail him out . <p> She posted the bond at the jail with only the promise that they would pay if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drug problem , " she said of the defendant , a plumber with a young child . " He needs to go home , get a plumbing job and be a father . " <p> As a woman , Green is a pioneer in the bail business . She was working at the College of San Mateo in purchasing when she took a job as office manager at a bonding agency . <p> When that agency moved , she opened her own company in 1970 . At the time , she says , she was one of very few female agents in the state . She runs Esther Green 's Bail Bonds with her husband , Jan Silva , across the street from the San Mateo County Jail . <p> These days , about 48 percent of bail agents nationwide are women , said Penny Harding , executive director of the California Bail Agents Association . Hours are often long but flexible , the pay can be good and the mostly male clientele like to see a friendly face . <p> Green 's office , next to a barber shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soft lighting . A coffee pot , some wood paneling and comfortable chairs give the impression of a den . <p> By comparison , the office at Davidson 's Bail Bonds Unlimited has all the charm of a waiting room . It 's functional  --  just desks and chairs . <p> Since the jail runs 24 hours a day , bail agents are captive to unpredictable hours waiting for the phone to ring . <p> In the San Mateo County Jail , advertisements for bail companies are posted near collect-only telephones in the booking area and in the longer-term holding areas . In the yellow pages , the smiling , compassionate faces of bail agents are proudly displayed . <p> Like Green 's , most bail companies have set up shop right across the street from the jail . <p> Some companies are low-key . Others use gaudy ads and bright neon signs outside their offices . One company mocks " child of the month " school bumper stickers with its own " my child was inmate of the month " stickers posted on its van , a joke that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Bail companies not only compete with one another but with the court system . <p> Beginning in the 1960s , court-supervised release programs were instituted for defendants awaiting trial . The idea was that the bail-based release system was unfair because only suspects with money could make bail . <p> Thousands of suspects , usually ones with jobs and ties to the community , are now released from jail each year with a promise that they will show up to court . <p> San Mateo County released about 3,580 suspects on their own recognizance last year , compared to 2,689 who posted bail . In Santa Clara County , about 4,500 suspects were released on their own recognizance and about 7,615 posted bail . <p> According to the state bail association , bond companies assist up to 15 percent of suspects who are released from jail before trial . That is down from 25 percent in the 1970s and 1980s . <p> While some lament the loss of potential customers , Green views the trend as good for business . Rather than write dozens of bonds for relatively low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Now , you 're dealing with three people instead of 30 , " she said . " They did us a favor . " <p> She recently wrote bonds for $100,000 , $50,000 and $25,000 . <p> Without the bail industry , backers claim , the state would face overcrowded jails or the cost of keeping tabs on thousands of defendants waiting trial . The industry boasts that bond companies have a better record of keeping track of suspects and ensuring they make court dates than government-sponsored release programs , because they have a strong financial incentive to do so . <p> Davidson and Green said only a small percentage of suspects skip court . If they do skip , bail companies have 180 days to produce a defendant or pay the bond in full . <p> At that point , the bond company can foreclose on whatever collateral the defendant or the defendant 's friends or relatives posted . But that 's a lengthy and difficult procedure , so with bond amounts that can reach six figures or higher , there 's a big incentive to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents claim the image of semi-outlaws stalking bail jumpers is mostly a thing of the past . <p> " We use licensed private investigators , " Davidson said . " There 's a lot of liability . " <p> But hunt them down they do . <p> Green is no pushover . She has hired professionals to track down bail jumpers from Minnesota to Las Vegas . <p> As part of the job , bail agents see the dark side of life . <p> Victims of domestic violence bail out their abusers ; long-suffering mothers once again bail out their sons ; drug abusers come back again and again . <p> Like a defense attorney , Green said she tries not to judge those seeking her help . Once , however , she refused to write a bond for a man accused of burning a child with a cigarette . <p> " I just could n't do it , " she said . " I did n't want to help this guy . I thought he belonged ( in jail ) . " <p> Send comments to wilsonm@sfgate.com.
