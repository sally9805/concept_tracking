Mother ( below ) prepares their daughter for a day at school . // THE Coaxums of Naperville , Ill. , do more before 7 a.m. than many families do all day , to borrow an apt phrase . No , Harry L. and Donna Coaxum and their 4-year-old daughter , Maya , are n't a military family . They 're a busy and , in their words , " blessed " family making its way in the fast lane of life , balancing relationships with one another , along with work and school , and a commitment to community . The Coaxums seem to be always on the move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coaxum is often the earliest riser , usually around 5 a.m. ) in their brick , two-level home in the Chicago suburbs to the time they find their pillows for some much-needed sleep at night , they are an active family unit . Both Harry and Donna Coaxum have high-powered positions with large corporations and take turns playing chauffer for their daughter , who attends a Montessori school that focuses on foreign languages . They decided to apply for acceptance to the selective school to better prepare Maya for a future where being bilingual would be a bonus . Both parents play active roles in their daughter 's education and seek to prepare her for a successful future . Photograph A frequent morning ritual for Harry Coaxum is measuring his daughter 's growth . // " When she was about to turn 3 , we knew that we wanted to prepare her for the next phase , and we thought that would be bilingual , " says Donna Coaxum , senior counsel for OSI Industries in Aurora , Ill. , who also has started an inspirational speaking business . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish is going to be spoken as much as English . " " What 's important for us is to give her the strongest foundation , so that she can be-as I say-ready for the world , " says Harry Coaxum , vice president , worldwide store operations for the McDonald 's Corporation . " The reality of our country is that being Black and being female will bring some challenges for her . The notion is what can we do , in terms of supporting her growth , education and developments so that whatever challenges she faces , she 'll be prepared . " Before Maya 's school day begins , the family has to get up and get going . Depending on their schedules for the day , either Donna or Harry takes Maya to school . More often than not , it 's Donna . And on the days when daddy is n't busy in the morning , he does the honors . Because he travels out of town on business sometimes , when he is at home , he wants to make it that much more special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm out the door by 6:30 or 6:45 , " says the father . " If I do n't have early-morning meetings , I 'll take her to school later . It gives me an opportunity to spend time with her , because I am gone occasionally . " Most mornings , Donna gets up , goes to the family 's finished basement and works out . Maya will often come down and watch or play while her mother exercises . Bathing Maya and getting her clothes ready at night leaves them more free time the next morning to do other things , including preparing lunch , faxing important documents or putting the finishing touches on a crucial work project . By all accounts , Maya is an extremely bright little girl , who sometimes appears to be more than 4 years old . At first meeting , you get the sense that she is a couple of years older , with a more serene bearing than many her age could muster . She knows how to program the microwave ( with supervision , of course ) , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her parents help her complete the tasks . Photograph At the Coxum home , spending time together as a family is essential , they say , and breakfast time is one of the best activities to make a family affair . Donna ( below ) chooses a book for Maya to read . // The same 4-year-old girl who admonishes her parents to keep their seat belts buckled until the car comes to a complete stop is the same little girl who likes to watch cartoons , eat fruit candy , play with the tea set in the kitchen and have her father routinely measure her growth on the bedroom door . Despite Maya 's rapid maturity , the Coaxums say , they do all they can to let her know and understand that she needs them - and will continue to need them for a while . Independence can only go so far as it does n't interfere with their being a family . " Sometimes , we have to set boundaries for her , to let her know that she 's only 4 , " says the mother , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Wisconsin  --  Madison . Photograph At the beginning of another busy day , the Coaxum family leaves their suburban home . // Her husband agrees , and says , " We strike the best balance we can in teaching her , educating her , and giving her some freedoms to do some things .... I think she 's starting to learn a little bit more about the interdependence that comes with being part of a family . " The Coaxums have worked hard and are committed to spending as much time together as their schedules allow . That , they say , is probably one of the most difficult parts of their familial relationship , finding the time to be together as a family . Harry Coaxum sometimes has to travel as part of his job and Donna Coaxum , who also travels , sometimes has important work projects that take up many of the hours she would otherwise spend at home . In addition , Maya will soon be ready to start ballet lessons and gymnastics to enrich her childhood . Fortunately , they say , Donna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to baby-sit or host Maya at her Chicago home during the times when Maya 's parents ' schedules get extremely hectic . " I realize we have only 24 hours in a day just like everyone else , " says Harry Coaxum . " You just run out of time . It gets tough when there is so much going on . " And there is a lot going on . Both Harry and Donna Coaxum take their civic responsibility to heart . Each belongs to nearly half a dozen organizations and attends meetings and conferences regularly . They often take Maya along with them to make sure she understands how important community involvement is , particularly in the African-American community . She is also learning how to grow spiritually , saying a prayer in the mornings and before meals . The family attends Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago 's South Side . Walking through the house the couple has shared since they were married in 1996 ( Harry bought the house in 1990 ) , you get a sense of a family deeply rooted in Black culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Afrocentric art adorns the walls . Community service awards and organizational affiliations are also in evidence . That 's a part of their philosophy as parents , to let their daughter in on their lives outside of the home . " Part of our philosophy is giving back to the world that we 're in . We 're real big into the Afrocentric side of our culture-who we are and showing ourselves in a very positive way , " says Harry Coaxum , a graduate of Talladega College in Alabama . " I think oftentimes in this environment there is not any reinforcement of who we are and our value systems . It 's just important that we do everything that we can to let her know that she is fine ; she has everything that she needs ; she is capable of doing anything that she wants with hard work and commitment .
