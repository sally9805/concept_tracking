The Center of Winter A Novel Kate It begins with a small town , far north . Motley , Minnesota , Pop . 442 . Near the headwaters of the muddy Mississippi , past the blue glass of the cities and the stained red brick of the warehouse districts , past the long-abandoned train stations and the Grain Belt sign and the Pillsbury Flour building on the riverbanks , past the smokestacks and hulking wrecks of the industrial section , the town lies past all this , in the center of the prairie that creeps north and west of the river , into the Dakotas . Seen from above , this prairie , its yellow grasses , is dotted sparsely with towns too small for mapmakers ' concern . Just south of Staples , on the county road that runs through the center of town , passing the school at the south edge , Norby 's Department Store , Morey 's Fish Co. , the market with the scarred front porch , the old brick storefronts with small wooden signs on hinges , the painted names of businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cafe . By the time you 've noticed that you 're passing through , County Road 10 swerves sharply to the left , past Y-Knot Liquors , and all semblance of town disappears , leaving you to wonder if there was a town after all . All you see are acres and acres of field . On the corner of Madison Street is a pale eggshell-blue house with three steps leading up from the walk and a postage stamp of yard in the back where my mother , when the spirit moved her , gardened feverishly and then let the garden go sprawling untended in the tropical wet of July . My father would sit on the back porch watching her , sitting the way men here sit : leaned back , feet planted far apart , arms on the arms of the chair , a beer in his right hand . The beer would be sweating . They met in New York , at a club . They met and got married at city hall , and when I had my mother alone , I demanded she tell me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red shoes , and the garnet necklace she got for a song . They had a party with cheap wine back at the apartment . I picture it all in rich colors . I remember the club for them , with red walls and small , spattered candles on the tables . Whether it had these things or not is of no concern to me , because it 's my story , not theirs . The garnet necklace is mine now . I keep thinking I ought to get the clasp repaired . " What were you wearing ? " My mother was soaping my head . " Sweetheart , I do n't remember . Dunk , " she said . I dunked and spluttered . " You have to remember , " I insisted . She laughed . " All right , " she said , and I could tell she was going to make it up , and I did n't care . " Black . A black coat . And a hat . " " What kind of hat ? " " Katie , for heaven 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She scrubbed my ears . In the hall my father was yelling for her , and the door opened . She turned to look at him . " There you are ! " he said . " When 's dinner ? " " I 'm bathing Katie . " " I can see that . " " When I 'm done . " He stood there . " Esau 's sulking , " he said . My mother turned back to me and started scrubbing my neck ferociously . " What am I supposed to do about it ? " " Hi , Daddy , " I said . " Hiya , kiddo , " he said . " I see your mother 's in one of her moods again . " I nodded . My mother rolled her eyes . " Well , all I can say , " my father said , and then paused as if thinking . " Yep , " he noted with finality , and closed the door . In the summer I wore a white nightgown and the sun did n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . We ate dinner out on the back porch . My father was watching the sky . " We ought to go down to the city , " he said . My mother snorted . " What , we should n't go down to the city ? " my father asked . " You do n't want to go down to the city ? There was something wrong with the suggestion ? " I sucked on my tomato wedge . My mother said nothing . " Claire ? " my father said . " Answer me . Do you or do you not want to go down to the city ? " " Mom , just answer him , " Esau muttered . We waited . " Yes , " my mother said carefully , " I would love to go down to the city . " My father grinned . " Good ! " he said . " We 'll have dinner . See a show . " He looked around the garden , pleased , and took a swallow of his drink . He leaned over and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said again . My mother smiled faintly at her plate . We would never go down to the city . The light was fading , the way light fades in a memory , objects losing their definition , faces falling into shadow . My mother was clearing the table and telling me to get ready for bed . And the house settled into obscurity for the night . My father watched night fall over his small square of the world while his wife did the dishes and his children did whatever it is that children do before bed . What was he thinking about ? Perhaps my mother startled slightly when he came up behind her at the sink and placed his hand on her arm . Perhaps she relaxed , and turned her face a little toward him . Perhaps they danced then in the living room , to old records , while I stood in my white nightgown and watched through my crackedopen door . I went to bed to the muffled sound of Count Basie , and the hot night , and imagined my brother on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America had gone all to hell , but that was far away . Nothing could happen to us because it was June and my brother was sleeping and my mother was the most beautiful woman in the world .
