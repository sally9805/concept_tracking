THE WALLS OF HOPE // Arkansas Beginnings // Few American presidents have had so little idea of their family ? s past as William Jefferson Clinton . On his father ? s side  --  well , the many questions that surround his paternity we must defer until later . On his mother ? s side , however , he had reasonable cause to believe he was a sixth-generation southerner , able to trace his Cassady forebears back through Alabama to South Carolina in the early nineteenth century . Then , in the late nineteenth century , he was told , a certain James Monroe Cassady left Alabama with his wife , Sarah Lou , and his Russell parents-in-law , in a traditional covered wagon . They migrated across the Mississippi River , moving to an area known as the New Hope Community and settling beside Ebenezer Primitive Baptist Church in Bodcaw , Nevada County , Arkansas , a group of extended families numbering perhaps a hundred souls , 110 miles southwest of Little Rock , the state capital . There , in 1886 , they built a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Whatever had been the motive for the Cassadys ? move , however , it did not bring prosperity for the family . Arkansas was , at the end of the nineteenth century , a backward , landlocked state , the twenty-fifth in the Union , some 55,000 square miles in size , bordering the Mississippi on its eastern side and abutting Indian territory on its western frontier . In between , spread out not only across its lowland , delta landscape but up high into its hinterlands , which stretched across the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains to the northwest , the state boasted almost one million people , almost no industry , the worst schools in the nation , and widespread poverty among whites as well as blacks  --  who , in the wake of slavery and the Civil War , made up more than a fifth of its population . // James Eldridge Cassidy // The Cassady family seemed to go in for presidential names  --  though none can seriously have imagined that one of their descendants would actually become a U.S. president . William Jefferson Clinton ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  though why James Monroe , his eldest son , left Alabama , several years after getting married in 1880 , nobody knows . It was on the small cotton farm in Bodcaw , Arkansas , however , that James Monroe ? s third son , James Eldridge Cassady  --  William Jefferson Clinton ? s grandfather  --  was born on August 19 , 1898 , the youngest of their five children . // James Eldridge Cassady ? s childhood was marred by poverty and death . He was orphaned at eight , when his father died of pneumonia on a train trip to the old family home in Alabama . The family farm was sold two years later , in 1906 , and , moving with his mother to her widower brother ? s home , he was thereafter raised by his uncle Bill Russell , alongside Bill ? s ten children , on whose cotton farm he was expected to work once he left school . This he did at age thirteen , after fifth grade . // Had cotton been financially profitable or had they been able to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of small Arkansas sharecroppers might have held out the prospect of economic progress after the ruinous years of civil war . However , without access to banking credit , small farmers in Arkansas had come to rely on cotton as their sole cash crop in order to survive  --  and the decline in the price of cotton in the latter part of the nineteenth century had resulted in white penury on a gigantic scale . " The debt-ridden , one-crop economy consigned the majority of Arkansans to subsistence on an annual income well below what would have been reckoned the poverty level in the growing American cities , " one historian summarized . // It was in rural poverty in Bodcaw , then , that young James Eldridge Cassady worked as a half orphan  --  and at age twenty-three , having changed the spelling of his name to Cassidy , he got married on January 3 , 1922 , to Valerie Edith Grisham , the nineteen-year-old proverbial girl next door , whose family was also " eking out a living raising cotton " on her family ? s " hardscrabble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grisham was a short , handsome , feisty girl who was somewhat better schooled than Eldridge , having reached eleventh grade . The following year , on June 6 , 1923 , Edie gave birth to a child , indeed their only child , a daughter whom they named Virginia  --  Virginia Dell Cassidy. // Poverty in rural Arkansas made for a difficult domestic life . Virginia later characterized her mother as a woman subject to uncontrollable rage  --  an anger that welled from somewhere deep inside her . Edie had been dealt , Virginia reflected , a cruel hand : born in south Arkansas in rural poverty , growing up on the land , and marrying on the land . In those days , Edie had no option  --  a person ? s life mirrored the relentless pattern of nature and the seasons . // With Virginia ? s birth , Edie did , however , opt for change . She insisted at the end of 1923 that she , her husband , and the infant leave the land and move twelve miles away , to the local market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times larger than Bodcaw , having expanded around a major cotton-market station on the Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad , effectively displacing the old Hempstead County town of Washington . Her childhood , Virginia later recalled , was punctuated with the whistles and bells of heavy locomotives , since her home was always by a railroad track . The segregated town ? s main roads had only recently been paved for whites , in 1920 , and boasted several expensive residences on " Cotton Row "  --  but the Cassidys were far from wealthy . They were " country poor , " as the town historian Mary Nell Turner put it , and lucky to find employment at the bottom of the proverbial white ladder . // One town resident later recalled that it was " a rough , busy , dirty , smelly town  --  in the damp , still air of evening every privy contributed its quota of perfume  --  but you couldn ? t help but love it . " Eldridge eventually found work in the Ivory Handle Company factory  --  which would ruin his health , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did , however , permit him in time to purchase his own four-room house on Foster Street , on a mortgage . // Edith , meanwhile , decided to carve her own career and proceeded to take a correspondence course in nursing , gaining a certificate as an auxiliary , or private-duty , nurse without having to attend college . It was just as well . In the wake of the Great Crash , a long drought , and the worsening economy , as Virginia recalled , money would become " extremely tight "  --  so tight that when Eldridge lost his job , he was unable to keep up the payments on his mortgage . The Great Depression had arrived . // The Depression Strikes // The Depression hit Arkansas as hard as or harder than any other state in the Union , largely because of its overdependence on cotton . " Cotton remained king for the first half of the twentieth century , " the Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper editor-turned-historian Harry Ashmore related  --  and the cost , in the 1920s and ? 30s , was ruin . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War I , the price began to slide until it fell lower than the cost of production : down to 16 cents per pound in 1928 , even before the Great Crash  --  and to a mere 4 cents four years after that . // In a state where , in 1930 , 63 percent of Arkansas farmers worked someone else ? s land , the quasi-feudal system of sharecropping spelled , in the Depression years , disaster and starvation . Attempts to unionize tenant farmers proved a failure , and cooperative farming also failed , since few but a handful of farmers , in the traditionally individualistic land of " hillbillies , " were interested in cooperating . Only God could provide . // The Depression , in other words , hit Arkansas like a long affliction , vitiating any hopes that the state would ever raise itself from its reputation as one of the most backward , uneducated , and fraudulent in America . " The state government remained insular and corrupt , " wrote Ben Johnson in his history of modern Arkansas , while the rapidly declining market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its face against agricultural diversification and lacked sufficient credit  --  state or private  --  to invest in alternative crops . As Johnson pointed out , the average Arkansas cotton farmer owned only $137 in equipment in 1929 , but the average rice grower required almost twenty times as much . Without federal , state , or commercial programs , cotton sharecroppers in the state found themselves simply too poor to make the switch . They had already racked up a 150 percent rise in indebtedness in the 1920s , following World War I  --  and they could not withstand the triple onslaught of flooding ( which in 1927 affected more than 13 percent of arable land ) , a crippling drought in 1930 , and the financial catastrophe resulting from the collapse of the Wall Street stock market and banking system the year before . With four out of every five of the state ? s residents living and working on farms and plantations  --  compared with only 20 percent working on the land in America as a whole  --  Arkansas was bound to suffer in the Depression , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state scene who was capable of mitigating the effects of the meteorological and financial drought . Fraud , intimidation , localism , and racism had long characterized Arkansas politics , leaving the state prostrate in the face of the economic debacle . The state ? s roads were the worst in the country , much highway spending having gone into the pockets of officials rather than into paving . Public education was probably the poorest in the United States , with schoolteachers licensed through a feeble county examination that required only four years of high school . The public debt , meanwhile , was the highest in the country . In a state of dirt roads , " dirt poor " became a reality , not a metaphor . // Between 100,000 and 200,000 white and black families  --  in a state of less than 2 million inhabitants  --  soon required Red Cross relief . " Barefoot and without decent clothes , no meal , no flour in the bin , ragged children crying from hunger . . . nothing but hunger and misery , " one aid worker described rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beaten down with a ruthlessness that shocked the nation . Attempts by federal officials , journalists , or outsiders to assess the economic , educational , social , and racial problems of Arkansas were met by vigilante violence that would have done justice to a banana republic  --  erstwhile slavery having been transformed into a peonage system that seemed little better . Visiting journalists described Arkansas , as the state historian Ben Johnson commented , " as a benighted land almost without parallel in the world . " // Coming in succession to a series of floods , drought , and bankruptcies , these events appeared to many to be a biblical prophecy being fulfilled . Certainly no politician ever came forward to speak for the dispossessed or against cruelty toward and intimidation of blacks . For decades fear had underlain the psyche of a male white population too uneducated to ask questions before resorting to shooting , murder , and lynching  --  even live " roasting . " " The Ku Klux Klan had a strong following throughout the state , " wrote the historian of black civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By 1924 it felt strong enough to contest the governorship in the Democratic primary "  --  making Arkansas a " dangerous place for African Americans , " one in which lynchings demonstrated " the impunity with which racist terrorists acted in Arkansas . " Will Turner , accused of attacking a white woman , had been seized from a sheriff ? s posse , hung , and burned before a crowd of thousands in 1921 in Helena . The Arkansas Survey , one of the state ? s few black newspapers , noted in an editorial that Helena was " a seething cauldron of hate , when the least indiscretion meant death . " Barely a week later Robert Hicks was hung by a public highway near Lake Village for simply sending a note to a white woman . In Little Rock the next year , a suspected armed robber was openly lynched in front of the Como Hotel in the downtown center . " No official action against the lynchers is expected , " The New York Times commented . Although the Klan ? s power had declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike . When John Carter , a black , was suspected by a mob of raping two white women , in 1927 , he was riddled with bullets and his body then towed around the black neighborhoods of the capital and finally set on fire on a pyre constructed of wooden pews ripped out of a black church  --  with no one indicted by the subsequent grand jury . // A century before , Arkansas had proudly advertised itself as an " asylum for the emigrant " ; indeed , the " last asylum , " as one group of proponents in Little Rock had stated , drawing white immigrants from Virginia , Kentucky , Alabama , North Carolina , Tennessee , and Louisiana . Mark Twain , however , had pictured it as a land of cowardly lynch mobs and " lunkheads , " the state becoming a symbol of much that was wrong , even evil , in America  --  symbolized in its political machinations . The Civil War had made an end of slavery , but the subsequent secret ballot , for example , had simply been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education system , to disenfranchise blacks , who , if illiterate , had to declare this at the polling precinct and submit to being intimidated , often at the end of white men ? s guns . Poll tax requirements had also militated against blacks ? voting , so that between 1890 and 1894 the black vote had decreased in Arkansas by a staggering 65,000 ! Fearing a coalition between Republicans ( the victors in the Civil War ) and agrarian reformers , the Democratic Party in Arkansas had retrenched to become the party of reactionary conservatism and segregation : " Dixiecrats . " In a move that contradicted the very meaning of its party name , the Arkansas Democratic Central Committee had even changed the nomination procedures for state primaries . Official Democratic Party candidates had to be chosen by a " popular " vote , it had determined  --  but with the proviso that only whites could cast those votes ! // From the Trade Paperback edition . //                    @
