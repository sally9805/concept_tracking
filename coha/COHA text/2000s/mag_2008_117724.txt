I WAS EIGHT when I knew I had a problem . A friend invited me over to ride horses , and already being a lover of the outdoors and animals , I was excited about the adventure . But it ended before it began . I stepped out of the car and was struck full blast by the smells of the barn , the horses , the hay , the fields of blowing grass , the flowers . In other words , pollen and mold were everywhere . Within minutes my head hurt , my nose was running and my eyes were red and secreting so much watery goo that they became glued shut . The crowning touch was a bulging sty under one lid . There was no denying it  --  I had allergies. // This is not exactly the kind of medical trauma that shows up on an episode of ER , but it 's more serious than a lot of people think , especially when you 're a golfer . As many as 40 million people in the U.S. suffer from nasal allergies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a day on the course than simply a little sun and some exercise . // In 1995 I was playing in a Futures tour event in Ocala , Fla. , and my allergies were so bad that every time I bent over to address the ball , fluid came rushing out of my nose . It became such a problem that I had no choice but to put tissues up each nostril to stanch the flow and allow me to finish the round . I ca n't tell you how thankful I am that there were no photographers around . I also ca n't tell you how sad I am that I 've had to resort to the tissue trick many more times during my career . // I never want to say that my allergies have cost me any sort of success , because I do n't like to make excuses , but they can definitely have an impact on your game . There were times when I could n't practice or play as long or as well as I would have liked because I could n't focus or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrations about allergies . In your head , you think , Ah , it 's only a runny nose . I should be able to play through it . But in reality , allergic reactions can hit as hard as the flu , complete with headaches , sore throats and general fatigue . // I know I 'm not alone in my misery , either . My sister , Shelley , a teaching pro at Timarron Country Club near Dallas , suffers so bad that sometimes she has to leave work by 2 p.m. so she can go home and lie down . On the LPGA tour lots of my fellow pros are afflicted . In fact , at the Franklin American Mortgage Championship outside Nashville , a place notorious for high pollen counts , we had a saying : You know it 's going to rain , and you know all the tissue boxes will be empty . // To make matters worse , people who do n't have allergies ca n't relate to the feeling at all and often look at you as if they 're trying to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of nothing . Those of us on the other side know it 's not nothing . Still , golf is the kind of game that keeps you coming back , despite the suffering . I just wish I were as allergic to double bogeys as I am to dandelions . That 's one affliction we should all be so fortunate to endure . // Jill McGill , an LPGA member since 1996 , is working with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America to promote awareness .
