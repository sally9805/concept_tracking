Memo to all Joel 's friends : Do n't even think about giving him one of your homespun CD mixes as a gift // MUSIC MIXES WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADULT activity . They were meant solely for 14-year-old girls who could only communicate their conflicted sexual desires by putting Chicago 's " You 're the Inspiration " right before Duran Duran 's " Wild Boys " - conflicted sexual desires that it may not have been wise for me to indulge by returning a mix of " Muskrat Love " and " Cherry Pie . " These days , people hand me homemade mix CDs as if they are actual gifts . They 're used for faux birthday presents , wedding favors , and to commemorate other occasions at which I 'm supposed to get real food items . Sure , Nick Hornby says in High Fidelity that one of life 's greatest joys is to know a person well enough to create the perfect mixtape , but , after reading the book , do you really want to get that close to Nick Hornby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way because , unlike our easily fooled parents , we know that dragging MP3s from column A to column B takes neither effort nor time . Burning CDs is a background activity , something you do during the nine minutes it takes to write your EW column . But now , after a stretch of mix-free peace ( after the CD killed the cassette and before disc-burning became a pastime ) , the mix is back-and is increasingly the preoccupation of grown-ups . Apple has introduced a 99-cents-per-song online store designed for yuppies who want to download music without being branded as Napster-style thieves . Convinced that they 're DJ Minivan , people over 30 are now sitting at home shuffling Wilco and Thunderclap Newman tracks , thinking their special skills will enrich the culture . Even if your grandfather had access to some kind of vinyl-smelting kit , do you think he 'd have thought it acceptable to give his boss a mash-up of " Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy " and " Mr. Bojangles " ? I 'm not sure what kind of music our grandparents listened to either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'm starting to get the feeling people expect me to thank them for their gift mixes . What am I supposed to say : " I never thought about Neil Young in quite the same way since you so cleverly rearranged the tracks on Decade " ? It 's like being given a self-help book-the gift-giver does n't care about you ; he just wants someone to talk to about how his cheese was moved . Giving a mix CD is far less about trying to make someone else happy than about desperately trying to let them know that you 're cool : You know who Flaming Lips are and you 're down with Eminem 's misogyny in a partially ironic way . Even the rare good mix is inherently evil . Thanks to a self-concocted junior high mixtape , every time I hear " Should I Stay or Should I Go ? " I expect " Karma Chameleon " to follow . It never does . And it takes a little piece of my soul each time . I 'm happy that technology is democratizing the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free time . Go ahead and make that stuttering mix ( " My Sharona , " " Foolin ' ' , " " My Generation , " " You Ai n't Seen Nothin Yet " ) and that masturbation mix ( " Pictures of Lily , " " She Bop , " " I Touch Myself , " " Rosie " ) and give them to anyone who asks for it . But before you hand friends mix CDs like they were poems you wrote specifically for them ( and despite the lessons learned from The Bachelorette , you should never write anyone a poem ) , realize that by now we all have the computing power to delude ourselves into thinking we can create better entertainment . We 're entering an age of endless vacation-picture slide shows , only with more arty pretense . It 's an era when self-restraint will be more appreciated than self-expression . That 's why I 'm trying to get paid for as many of these columns as I can . <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
