<p> Saddam Hussein has been a very naughty boy and may need a spanking . If so , Hans Blix has the right man for the job : Jack McGeorge of Woodbridge , Va. , U.N . weapons inspector and co-founder of a group called Black Rose  --  dedicated to S &M.; Really . <p> Sen. John Kerry is the latest liberal Democrat from Massachusetts to run for president . On December 1 , he announced that he 's forming a committee to raise funds for his party 's nomination . As a decorated Vietnam vet , Kerry will first try to distinguish himself with his biography . He will eventually have to turn to issues , however , and on the domestic front he offers little more than the left-wing fare of hostility to tax cuts and school choice . On foreign policy , Kerry can play a more useful role , though he 's no hawk  --  he opposed the Gulf War a decade ago and is not a fan of military action in Iraq now . His criticism earlier this year of George W. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan may have been opportunistic  --  but it may also have been correct . Pressing this theme would serve the public interest , insofar as it encourages the administration to risk troops when the cause is important enough . So would robust criticism of the Saudi regime . Most Democrats spent 2002 wishing away the war on terrorism , because they saw it as benefiting the GOP . It 's not going away . Kerry is hereby invited to prove that Democrats have their own contribution to make to the war effort . <p> The bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel on Kenya 's Indian Ocean coast , plus the unsuccessful attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner bound from Mombasa to Tel Aviv with shoulder-launched missiles , invert Flannery O'Connor . Everything that sinks must converge . The hand of al-Qaeda , or some clone , is all over them . The bin Ladenites rail against Zionists and Jews ; how natural that they would turn to Israeli targets , sealing their sympathy with Palestinian terrorists and their sponsors . No defense , however thorough , can stifle every assault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leadership of that fight has fallen , after 9/11 , to the United States . As NRO contributor Michael Ledeen constantly intones : Faster , please . <p> In deciding whether to make a smallpox vaccine available to Americans who wish to be inoculated , President Bush faces a classic case of weighing the alternative risks . According to government officials , Iraq , along with North Korea and Russia , has stockpiles of the deadly virus . Dr. Richard Spertzel , the U.N . ' s former chief biological-weapons inspector , has testified that an " errand boy , " with no specialized knowledge , could easily deliver a small amount to devastating effect . Released in an office building , the virus would kill 30 percent of those exposed . During the incubation period , ten additional people would be exposed for each person initially infected . Simultaneous attacks would infect thousands , and in turn tens of thousands . Unthinkable ? So was the idea that hijacked airplanes would be slammed into skyscrapers filled with workers . In the 1960s , when there were mass inoculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time had severe complications , and one or two died . But a mass vaccination program today could screen out those most at risk for serious complications . And a semi-mass vaccination program is already in the works . A panel of bioterrorism experts has recommended that 500,000 health-care workers be inoculated immediately , and that the vaccine be made available to 10 million emergency workers ; but the panel opposed mass inoculations . A pox on them . A president who repeatedly insists that he trusts the American people should trust them to weigh the risks of getting the vaccine for themselves . <p> As if going for socialized medicine were n't enough , Al Gore has continued his leftward lurch by co-authoring Joined at the Heart , a book about the American family , with his wife Tipper . On the surface , Joined at the Heart is a moderately liberal love letter to the American family . The Gores encourage novel family forms , while still worrying about high divorce rates and single parenting . In reality , the book rests on a breathtakingly radical premise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdated and irrelevant , and should be set aside by the courts . As long as a group of people love one another , say the Gores  --  as long as they 're " joined at the heart "  --  the law should n't prevent them from being considered a family . If this theory is adopted by the courts , not only gay marriage , but polygamy and group marriage are sure to follow . Once that happens , we 'll see a massive spike in divorce and single mothering  --  the very things the Gores say they abhor . The Gores may be joined at the heart , but they are unfortunately adrift at the head . <p> The homeless are back on the streets of Michael Bloomberg 's New York : An Explosion of the Homeless , headlined the New York Daily News ; up by 13 percent since July 1 , said the New York Times . When street life is marginally onerous , many even of the unfortunate find ways to avoid it . But all the experience of the Giuliani years has been unlearned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxing commuters , seeking handouts from Albany and Washington , and making the bars smoke-free ? <p> When Nigerian journalist Isioma Daniel wrote that the contestants of the Miss World beauty pageant , then being held in Abuja , might well have supplied Muhammad with a wife , Muslim mobs attacked Christians , and Muslim leaders issued a fatwa against Daniel . Hundreds of Nigerians died in the ensuing riots ; Daniel fled to the United States . Shame , in ascending order , on the Miss World organizers , who whisked their contest to London without a word of complaint ; on journalists worldwide , who wrote up the violence as an evenhanded religious spat , as if Nigerian Christians were co-aggressors , not victims ; and on Olusegun Obasanjo , Nigeria 's president , who blamed the violence on " irresponsible journalism committed against Islam . " The crowners of beauty queens are not politicians . But journalists and leaders should speak the truth about feral sectaries . <p> Things are in a bad way all over the Third World , but few countries are more comprehensively wretched than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war between the Islamic north and the Christian south , with a death toll of more than 2 million , and such incidental brutalities as mass deportations , a flourishing slave trade , and chronic banditry . South-Sudanese female writer Kola Boof , who lives in California , has been exposing the atrocities of Sudan 's Islamic rulers for years . Now the Islamists have struck back at her . In response to her latest book , a collection of short stories about the sufferings of her people , a fatwa has been issued against Ms. Boof , calling for her to be killed by beheading . The truly shocking thing here is that the fatwa was issued by an Islamic court in London , and announced to the world by a London-based Sudanese diplomat . The leader of Sudan 's ruling party later confirmed the fatwa . Ms. Boof had previously been threatened with death by none other than Osama bin Laden , who told her , in a 1998 telephone conversation : " If I had the time to waste , I would slit your throat myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian governments were this bad might have been in 1965 . While on a visit to the States , prime minister Lester Pearson criticized U.S. policy in Vietnam . In a private meeting Lyndon Johnson burst into an hour-long purple rage . He flayed Pearson , shouting , " You do n't come here and piss on my rug ! " More recently , at the NATO summit in Prague , Francoise Ducros  --  the communications director for prime minister Jean Chretien  --  called the president of the United States a " moron . " At first Mme Ducros was defiant , but then she apologized to the prime minister ( though not to Bush ) , and then she , reluctantly , offered Chretien her resignation , which the PM rejected . All of this took place against a backdrop of growing frustration among White House officials with Canada 's obstreperousness about the war on terrorism and its general anti-American boorishness  --  chronicled in our Nov. 25 issue by Jonah Goldberg . On November 26 , Ms. Ducros finally resigned after a ten-minute segment on CNN 's Crossfire ( featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toronto Sun columnist , the cable spat made the story " too big to ignore . " Which is doubly noteworthy . Not only is Ducros gone , but the precipitating event proves one of our writer 's points : that Canadians are unhealthily obsessed with what America thinks of them . <p> NATO admitted seven new member nations at its Prague summit  --  Slovakia , Slovenia , Romania , Bulgaria , Latvia , Lithuania , and Estonia . Perhaps not since the Congress of Vienna has so much of Europe been peacefully linked , with the addition of the indispensable balance wheel and peacekeeper , the United States . The summit agreed to form a 21,000-man Response Force , to operate outside Europe , whence most of the threats to civilization will be coming . Big items on the agenda for the future involve reassurance : of Russia , that the alliance is not directed against it , so long as there is no reversion to Soviet-era behavior ; and of NATO-member Turkey , that if the European Alliance continues to reject its bid for membership , its true home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old night of Islamism . <p> King Constantine , onetime monarch of Greece , won a big victory in the European Court of Human Rights : The government in Athens must compensate him for the property stolen from him in 1967 , when he fled after a military coup . Now , if only the Greeks will let him back into the country  --  say , for the 2004 Olympics . Constantine has been barred from setting foot on Greek soil . What does the government have to fear ? That democracy will crumble if this gentleman does a little sightseeing and visits old friends ? Is the Greek government so insecure as that ? And is democracy so fragile in the land of its birth ? The readmission of Constantine will be an indication of national health and self-confidence . <p> The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently announced a $100 million grant to launch the India AIDS Initiative , which will focus on prevention and education . This latest grant is in addition to the $450 million the Gates Foundation previously committed to the battle against AIDS . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and U.S. government officials estimate that by 2010 India could have over 25 million people infected . Bill Gates hopes to help India avoid the devastating spread of the disease that has afflicted sub-Saharan Africa . His gift , however , was not universally welcomed . India 's health minister accused him of " spreading panic " about AIDS . Some cynics suggested that because Microsoft has invested $400 million in India , Gates 's motive is more Big Businessman than Good Samaritan . Others sniff that the donation represents a relative pittance given the CEO 's billions . Please . Countless African lives could have been saved had more governments reacted in the early stages of their epidemics with a measure of " panic " rather than indifference . And if India is near the front of Gates 's mind because of his business  --  so what ? <p> The Bundesnachrichtendienst , or BND , is Germany 's secret service , custodian of the nation 's secrets , whatever they may be in this age of European harmony . Apparently tired of the obscurity that , you might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BND is going to open a retail outlet . Starting sometime soon , you will be able to buy T-shirts , stationery , jackets , and men 's underwear ( BND BVDs ? ) emblazoned with expressions like Top Secret and Classified . Grumbled a BND spokesperson , when asked about the proposed store : " This information was not supposed to get out . The shop is n't due to open until next year . " It was a secret , you see , but got leaked to the press somehow . Possibly the plans were filed in the wrong folder or underdrawers . <p> On November 13 , police mounted dawn raids on some 150 addresses in London , arresting over 90 people on suspicion of having committed " hate crimes . " The BBC 's website noted that " twenty-seven people have been charged , including one for rape , but most have been arrested on suspicion of making racist threats and of homophobic harassment . " The rather astonishingly named Commander Cressida Dick explained to reporters : " We want the offenders who hate , hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in its power to find them out and put a stop to their crime . " We would make the obligatory joke about the Thought Police , but surely even Orwell 's goons had better taste than to pretend that speech , however offensive , is the same kind of crime as rape . <p> Bien-pensants on the newly formed Committee on Healthy Diversity at Harvard Law School are busy at work devising a speech code to soothe the sensitivities of black activists . Following a series of minor racial incidents last spring , cries of racism went up , Cornel West charged in , and the administration began discussing the need for diversity and sensitivity training and a speech code ( which goes by the name of a " harassment policy " ) . Leaving aside the sheer nuttiness of believing that racism , institutional or otherwise , exists at Harvard Law School , there is a more obvious point to be made here : Complaints by the Black Law Students Association of " chilled speech " and intimidation are being resolved by chilling speech and intimidating students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to root for , " chuckled a conservative jurist of our acquaintance . He was talking about the controversy instigated by the Muslim Legal Defense and Education Fund , which has lodged a professional complaint against Harvard law prof Alan Dershowitz . The Muslims have asked the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers , the state 's legal disciplinary authority , to punish Dersh for urging the Israelis to respond to suicide bombings by demolishing houses in the bombers ' villages . The petitioners say Dershowitz is advocating war crimes . A number of lawyers have weighed in to say the charge is nonsense and a clear attempt by the Muslim lawyers group to stifle free speech  --  which is why our conservative jurist friend quite rightly took Dershowitz 's side . In fact , the complaint is so frivolous that the Muslim lawyers who raised it may face disciplinary action themselves , some experts say . Let 's hope so . There is an ugly trend of Islamic groups in the West attempting to use the system to quash speech they dislike . In France , they 've sued unsuccessfully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding on that front against The Dersh , they 're trying rather desperately to manipulate a professional association . Alas for them , America has a Constitution , not shari'a , and Muslims who intend to practice law in this country must be made to understand that . <p> Jazlyn Bradley of Brooklyn , N.Y. , is 19 years old , 5 foot 6 inches tall , and weighs 270 pounds . Ashley Pelman , of the Bronx , is 14 years old , 4 foot 10 , and weighs 170 pounds . Naturally , someone must be to blame for this regrettable state of affairs ; and , just as naturally , the fearless trial lawyers of America know who it is  --  McDonald 's ! In a class-action lawsuit against the fast-food chain , the Misses Bradley and Pelman , together with some other city teens , are suing McDonald 's for damages related to their obesity . Miss Bradley claims to have eaten twice a day at McDonald 's for years . Declared her father in an affidavit : " I always believed McDonald 's was healthy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far in the court system is still uncertain ; but we do hope that someone in authority will find a way to prosecute Mr. Bradley and the parents of the other teen plaintiffs for incorrigible stupidity . <p> A gun distributor has been found liable for a murder , in a decision celebrated by armophobes . The case involved a teenage boy who stole a neighbor 's gun and shot a teacher in the face , killing him . The jury found Valor Corp. , the gun distributor , partly responsible for the murder , arguing that it was negligent for not including a safety feature , such as a lock , on a gun obtained legally by a man uninvolved in the crime . This is the first time a gun company has been found liable for supplying a gun without a lock , and we are quite sure it will not be the last . Inexplicably , the jury ignored Valor Corp . ' s further offense of distributing a gun that included a trigger . <p> " There 's a sexual revolution going on in America , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , here we go again . But read on . The magazine reports that there is among teenagers " a new counterculture " made up of kids who have decided to postpone sex until marriage . A recent Centers for Disease Control study finds that the number of high-schoolers who say they 've never had sex rose 10 percent between 1991 and 2001 . Crediting ( or blaming ) the efforts of " cultural conservatives and evangelical Christians " for the reversal , the magazine spoke to American teenagers who gainsay the media-created stereotype of teen virgins as prudes . Religious faith plays a key role in the decisions these teens made for chastity , but it does n't tell the whole story . Parents who care enough to be open and blunt with their children about their expectations for moral behavior are also an important factor . " It 's amazing , but they did listen , " one mom confessed . What Tom Wolfe called The Great Relearning may have begun . The Bush administration is asking for $135 million more to fund abstinence-education programs in public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As of November 25 , the New York Times had run 32 stories on the fact that Augusta National Golf Club has no female members . Many of those stories appeared on Page One . In an important and somewhat brave article  --  also published in Newsweek  --  Seth Mnookin quoted a Times staffer : " That was just shocking referring to one particularly appalling story , part of the paper 's crusade . It makes it hard for us to have credibility on other issues . " Mnookin outlined the ways in which the Times 's new editor , Howell Raines , has made the paper more left , less newsy , and more advocacy-laden . Wrote Mnookin , " The Masters coverage is so overheated , one staffer says , that Raines is ' in danger of losing the building . ' " Good . First " the building , " then ? <p> What 's the most reprehensible thing you 've read in , oh , the last six months ? Here is a candidate , from a movie review by David Denby in The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying America might want to consider the delicacy of the white-black friendships in ' 8 Mile . ' ( Perhaps the spectre of such friendships is what right-wingers actually hate most . ) " That 's right : We 're trying to keep blacks and whites from being friends with each other , now that the Emancipation Proclamation has gone and cost us our slaves . The New Yorker , a great magazine , and David Remnick , its editor , and a great journalist , should be ashamed . <p> According to those who knew her , Mary Stachowicz was a faithful Catholic who devoted herself to good works . " She was a Eucharistic minister , assisted in distributing food to the poor , and anytime there was anything to be volunteered for , she volunteered , " said her parish priest . The 51-year-old woman may have thought herself on an errand of mercy when she left daily Mass to visit Nicholas Gutierrez , 19 , a troubled acquaintance . As Gutierrez later told police , Stachowicz angered him when she asked the homosexual young man , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " According to police , " The defendant punched and kicked and stabbed the victim until he was tired . He then placed a plastic garbage bag over her head and strangled her . " We do not believe in the concept of " hate crime , " but for those who do , the murder of Mary Stachowicz would appear to be an open-and-shut case . Yet Chicago authorities see no evidence of a bias crime . Nor has there been any notice paid by the national media , which devoted enormous attention to the vicious murder of the homosexual Matthew Shepard . We wish we were surprised . <p> In November , fire-department officials in Omaha , Neb. , offered five of seven captain 's jobs to white men who had scored at the top of their class on an advancement test . Under affirmative-action rules , however , the next promotion was then offered to first a white woman ( ranked 24th ) , then a black man ( 36th ) , and then another white woman ( 37th )  --  all of whom turned it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit . " You have people in a fire station trying to work together , live together , " one fireman explained to reporters . " To have someone take a promotion based on race  --  not where they finished on the test  --  that 's very frustrating to a number of people . " The firemen 's boycott sent a clear message . Will Omaha 's rulemakers listen ? <p> John F. Kennedy , for years before his presidency and during his brief service in the Oval Office , was a sick man . This almost certainly had an effect on his performance of his duties . For years , his condition had been assiduously concealed by the keepers of the Kennedy myth . But now many of the facts have been revealed by historian Robert Dallek , who has had access to the records . It is remarkable that Kennedy lived to be president . He had suffered from adolescent venereal disease and later from attendant urinary and prostate conditions . He also had life-threatening Addison 's disease , and through his father 's influence got into the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading to repeated infections . His osteoporosis led to excruciating spinal weaknesses . He required continual hormone injections . Despite all this , he was presented to the American people as a young man of vigor and athleticism . File it under " Great Presidential Myths , " near " Camelot . " <p> The atmosphere of medieval European university cities , which saw frequent pitched battles between " town " and " gown , " seems to be returning to 21st-century America . When Ohio State defeated Michigan in a football game recently , the victory celebrations degenerated into a riot that left downtown Columbus littered with overturned cars and impromptu bonfires . Police made 54 arrests , described as " mostly white men in their late teens and 20s . " Several were students at OSU . This incident followed a similar disturbance this April in St. Paul , following the NCAA hockey championship , when police made about 25 arrests . Last year at Purdue , students rioted after a women 's basketball game . What we want to know is : In between political agitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when do students get any actual studying done ? <p> The death of John Rawls at 81 last month reminded us that different philosophers perform different intellectual services . Some coax us to recognize important truths ; some open up important avenues of emotion or reflection ; some illustrate important mistakes . It was to this last category that Rawls belonged . His landmark book A Theory of Justice ( 1971 ) did readers the immeasurable service of making big mistakes brazenly . Not that his many grateful readers  --  legion upon legion of liberal academics  --  recognized Prof. Rawls 's labors for what they were , to wit : an ideologically motivated apology for egalitarianism and the welfare state . On the contrary , Rawls persuaded them , as he had persuaded himself , that his theory of justice represented what any rational person , unburdened by " the veil of ignorance , " would think . This is one of liberalism 's greatest tricks , first perfected by John Stuart Mill : You monopolize reason and purity for the home team while assigning politics , self-interest , and parti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rawls , have seen through the veil of ignorance . I am motivated not by politics but by reason alone . It is reason that requires the redistribution of wealth and the remaking of society according to the Left-liberal blueprint . " Rawls said what liberals dearly wanted to hear . It is no wonder they proclaimed him a genius . R.I.P . <p> Angus Cameron was a talented editor who had a Communist worldview and was perfectly open about it . In fact , he enjoyed defending it . In its obituary of Cameron , the New York Times air-brushed much of that . According to the Times , Mr. Cameron " belonged to many leftist organizations and spoke publicly about his beliefs , " " came under scathing criticism from conservatives , " and was " forced out in the McCarthy era . " That last refers to Cameron 's departure from the publishing firm of Little , Brown in 1951 . The conservative and McCarthyite who made Cameron 's position at Little , Brown untenable was one of its major authors , Arthur Schlesinger Jr . The historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orwell 's Animal Farm . The publisher rejected the book , now a classic and perennial bestseller by an Olympian writer . Schlesinger made his displeasure abundantly clear . As a result of this " witch hunt , " Cameron departed . ( He was later hired by Alfred Knopf , where he edited , among much else , future NR senior editor Jeffrey Hart 's first book , Political Writers of Eighteenth Century England . ) The Times has a metaphysical principle to the effect that Communists did not exist and were invented by McCarthy . So , to use a metaphor , it defrocked him . Now dead at 93 , Mr. Cameron would have been outraged . R.I.P . <p> Planned Parenthood is selling Christmas cards with the slogan " Choice on Earth . " The phrase it plays on , " Peace on Earth , " is from the Gospel of Luke , where an angel announces the birth of Christ in Bethlehem . Planned Parenthood is , of course , the nation 's largest provider of abortion services , and helped to terminate nearly 200,000 pregnancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help wondering : Why , if abortion is such a blessing , are its practitioners now so eager to celebrate history 's most famous unplanned pregnancy ? <p>
