Chapter One THAT NIGHT So , for Howie , it was , at last : neither resignation on the one hand , nor anger on the other . No , it was simply awful , horrible disappointment that tore at him . That it all must end this way . No , not this way . Anyway it ended would be a calamity , because despair would follow , and Howie understood himself well enough to know that he did n't possess the creative resources to really ever overcome that despair . This is the way he put it , over the phone , to Lindsay : " I 'm a dead man , sweetie . I know I wo n't get outta Baltimore alive . " Howie was , after all , a practical man . Whenever one of his regulars would go onto the disabled list , all the writers would flutter around him , asking how the team could possibly manage until the wounded star returned . " I do n't deal with the dead , " Howie would reply . That concluded the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You play with what you had . And now it was he who was the dead man , because he was positive that he was going to be fired in Baltimore , and that would mean the end of his life in baseball , which was the only existence he had ever known . There was a singular blessing.Because his demise was so clear-cut , he had , for the short term , found a certain calm within , so by the time he got to Baltimore he was concerned mostly with how , when the inevitable happened , he must display dignity upon his leave-taking . There would be no grousing . He would , in fact , thank the Indians for giving him the opportunity to manage in the major leagues . He would wish the team and the organization well . There would be no backbiting . Of course , yes , he would , in passing ( only in passing , you understand ) , recall how well the team had done under his aegis his first year on the job . He would not embellish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing ) so as to remind everyone that just because Howie Traveler was a busher , he had shown that he could damn well manage a team in the big leagues . He had proved that . It was important to leave the media bastards with that . Especially the talk radio bastards , those who spewed venom for a living , and those amateur venom-spewing bastards who just called in . When he got to Baltimore and found the time , Howie was going to write down what he wanted to say , and then commit it to memory so that he would display extemporaneous eloquence in his last public appearance . In the meantime , he tried to pretend that he was not dwelling on what everyone knew . The pallbearers were assembling . Not only the columnists from the Plain Dealer and the Akron Beacon Journal , but , as well , the lead columnist of the Columbus Dispatch had signed onto the press manifest this trip , ready to dress up his obituary on the spot for the enlightenment of central Ohio fans . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred for these proceedings . Fire the manager away from home . Let an interim manager-in this case , the team 's trusty old reliable , Spencer " Frosty " Westerfield , the bench coach-handle the next series , in Chicago , and then have the new man on hand , prepared to assume command- " take the helm , " as the papers would have it-when the team returned to Cleveland , ready to start fresh , turn a new leaf , salvage the season , restore the damage that he , Howie Traveler , had indisputably done . Never was anything so pat . So Howie just waited for Moncrief to fly in from Cleveland and fire him . Of course , everybody knows that baseball managers are , as it is written in stone , hired to be fired , but this was cold comfort when you were the manager in question and this was your time to be eighty-sixed . O'Reilly , one of the newspaper beat men who liked Howie and drank with him sometimes , told him that Diaz was already in Cleveland , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Reilly said they knew he was there . This figured . Even when the Indians had hired Howie , the season before last , there had been a lot of speculation that Diaz would get the job instead . Diaz was surely Jay Alcazar 's man , and if Juan Francisco Alcazar , El Jefe-The Chief-could not put out his best for Howie ( which this season he evidently chose not to ) then it would be just a matter of time before Diaz was brought in . So this is where it stood , Diaz working out the details of his contract , whereupon , that buttoned up , Moncrief would pop over to Baltimore , via Southwest Air , and , with the saddest , most sympathetic expression he could manage to put on , basset-faced , he would tell Howie that he was toast . Once there was a basketball coach named Cholly Eckman , and when he got a call from the owner , who told him he was " going to make a change in your department , " Cholly said " fine . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was the only one in his department . Nowadays , though , what general managers tell managers when they fire them is that : " We have decided to go in another direction . " Unsaid : that direction will be up , whereas you , you dumb sonuvabitch , have been taking us in a direction that is most assuredly down . So now , Howie put on the best smile he could manage , of the sort he assayed when he had to take a staged photograph at a charity auction or some such thing . " I wish I could think to say something really clever wise-ass when Moncrief tells me that , " he said . He had arrived in Baltimore and was eating dinner ( as best he could ) with his daughter . " Do n't , Daddy , " Lindsay said . " Just be classy , like always . Everybody with any sense knows it 's not your fault . Go out with style , and that 'll help you get another chance . " Howie took his hand off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lindsay was his only daughter , only family now , really . How adorable it was of her , how thoughtful , that she had come up from Washington , where she worked as a lawyer for some arcane House subcommittee , to see him . She had just showed up , knowing what an incredibly difficult time he was going through . She had been standing there when Howie came out of the clubhouse after the game tonight . The Indians had beaten the Orioles , 6-4 . Alcazar had gone three-for-five , with a monstrous home run and then a two-run double in the ninth that won the game . He 'd been dogging it all season , it seemed , but now that he knew Howie was shit-canned , he was suddenly a hitting fool again . And then there was Lindsay , standing outside the clubhouse . Howie almost cried . Funny , too . He did n't instantly recognize her , for she was there , amidst a covey of other women , who were there to consort with his ballplayers . Howie could forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that : as pretty ( well , almost so ) as the sort of women ball-players would take out on the road . Lindsay Traveler had more style , though , than those sort of women . Howie did n't himself necessarily possess style-for one thing , to his eternal despair , his legs were too short , and he had a lumpy face-but he recognized style when he was within its penumbra . Somehow , Lindsay-she , a lousy minor league ballplayer 's daughter-had learned to dress in that way chic ladies of fashion do , with the ability to choose clothes that manage to work so perfectly that they count twice-once for how they look and then again because they proclaim to the world : this lady knows what 's best , what 's right , what 's stylish , so do n't even try to put one over on her . Howie just wished she would let her hair grow longer , have it tumbling down , the way she did when she was younger . That was his only real complaint with her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Guys like me just get the one shot . " " Maybe not , " Lindsay said . " Nah , and now I 'm pegged , too . Traveler ca n't get along with the big star . I 'm old school . A hard ass . I thought Jay could work with me , and he did last year , but- " Howie shrugged . He did n't want to go over it anymore . These last few days , he had constantly had to talk with the writers about the possibility of his getting fired , and everybody else avoided him , so , effectively , for some time now , he had n't talked about anything else . So he asked Lindsay about her job and her iffy boyfriend and anything else he could think of , so he did n't have to talk about himself getting fired . He also asked : " How 's your mother ? " and Lindsay told him , obliquely . Howie said to give her his best , and Lindsay said of course she would . Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stand with the best of them . She had her mother 's wonderful green eyes , too . This occurred to Howie now . Also , better boobs . This was a terrible thing to pay attention to , your own daughter 's boobs , but it did cross his mind-but only relatively , you understand , only as they compared to his ex-wife 's boobs . He went back to focusing on her eyes . Then there was no more to say , and so he called for the check . They had gone to a restaurant in Little Italy , which was just far enough away from the hotel , at the Inner Harbor , and far enough off the beaten track that nobody was liable to find him there . " Are you sure you wan na drive back to Washington ? " he asked . " I think the couch pulls out . " Managers got suites . So , alone among the Cleveland players , did Alcazar . It was in his latest contract . Not enough he got seventeen and a half million a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive clauses . Excuse me , Howie thought : seventeen-five with five zeroes was n't incentive enough ? " No , Daddy . I 'll go back . I 'm taking next week off and goin ' down to the beach in Delaware , so I 've got ta finish a lot of stuff . " " Last chance to use your old man 's manager 's suite . " But she said no again , and dropped him back off at the hotel , where she gave him a big hug . " I 'm very proud of you , " Lindsay said , and Howie knew she was starting to cry . She had n't cried the whole time , up to now . " I 'm prouder of you , " he replied , reaching across the seat , holding her as best he could , behind the steering wheel . Had he been feeling particularly guilty , he would have added : All you managed without a father . Her whole life , he had been away so much of the time , being a player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dumps right now , there was n't space in his battered old mind to review the familiar old guilt , too . He just held his daughter a little tighter , and then pulled away , got out of the car and went through the lobby walking quickly , dead on toward the elevators , looking straight ahead , praying there was nobody there to ask him about whether he 'd heard anything new about his own impending demise . As it turned out soon enough , too bad there had n't been somebody there to delay him . On his floor , he hurried down the hall . And then the door just ahead of him to his right flew open . If only Lindsay had come up with him . If only he 'd arrived here a minute earlier or a minute later . Just that , either way . Seconds . The one thing Howie knew , whenever he looked back on it , was that he did not want that door to open before him . But it did , and even before Alcazar came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed the door shut with his foot-almost as quickly as it had opened-for just those split seconds , Howie saw it all clearly . And he remembered exactly what he saw and what he heard . It was not much , but then , after all , it happened so quickly that there was not enough for his vision of it to be blurred . No , however much Howie was taken by surprise , however much that made him freeze in his steps , it emblazoned the scene in his memory : the woman , pretty ( if in no special way ) but built rather nicely , her blouse pulled out just a bit from her skirt , her hair out of place some , her face creased with shock as Alcazar 's strong arms came up behind her , wrapped round her waist , yanking her back as she tried to get away , even as his foot reared up and violently slammed the door shut . And that last moment before she disappeared as she caught sight of Howie in the hall and her mouth seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no sound , just the pretty enough face , aghast , and then the door slamming shut before him . Howie had paused there , listening , pondering whether he should knock . But he heard nothing-certainly no scream , no struggle-and , at last , he only turned and went down the hall to his suite . There he poured himself another bourbon , a nightcap , but it did n't help , for all he could think about was that he had n't had the nerve to intrude . It was too late now . Whatever Alcazar was going to do with that woman , he had done it . No , it was n't any business of his who his players were screwing , but this seemed to be a different kettle of fish , completely . Had standing there in the hall like some dummy waiting for a bus given Alcazar the chance to rape her ? Had Jay actually done that ? Rape ? Jay Alcazar-tall , dark and handsome , rich and clever , the veritable idol of millions , who could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's green earth anytime he wanted it-what the hell would he be doing forcing it on some woman ? Sure , a stiff dick has no conscience and all that , but ... But the goddamn door had flown open and she was obviously trying to get away , and Jay had grabbed her roughly and would n't let her escape from him . There were not many times in his life when Howie felt that he had failed for lack of trying . Failed , yes-of course he had failed . After all , he had failed as a ballplayer ; he had failed at the thing he wanted most in the world . But he had tried his damndest . But now , when he was tested by a moment , by that exquisitely raw instant when a man either grabs the grenade and throws it back or dives for his own safety , he had found out who he was . He knew he had failed himself , and , in a very real way , he realized that , above all , he had failed his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other bourbon in the mini-bar , but put it back . No . One was a nightcap ; two was escape , a scaredy-cat , a drunk . So then he just got into bed and hoped that he could sleep , and he did , at last , at least for awhile . But not much . He was wide awake at eight o'clock when the phone rang . It was Moncrief . Well , at least the waiting was over . He even hoped Moncrief would tell him right now , over the phone , that the Indians had decided to go in another direction . For Christ 's sweet sake , he did n't need a face-to-face to tell him what he already knew . But no , Moncrief did n't even want to talk about Howie 's job , let alone about making a change in his department . Instead , it was another urgent matter . It was about what had happened behind the door that had opened and closed in Howie 's face , while he had stood there stunned and lacking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in whatever organization he was part of at that time , what you have to never forget , is that everybody who made the major leagues used to be a star . Probably from the first day they played the game as kids they could hit a ball or pitch it-or probably even do both-better than everyone else around them . At each level some of the best ones would drop off . They did n't care enough . They did n't want to work hard enough . Or there was , perhaps , just one thing they could n't manage at this next step up . Usually , for batters , they could n't hit a breaking pitch . Or , for pitchers , they could n't learn to throw a breaking pitch . At a certain point , it did n't make any difference whether you could hit a fast ball four hundred-some feet or throw it ninety-some miles-an-hour , because if you could n't hit a ball that curved or make a ball curve over the plate , then you were finished . So a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayside . But the point was that the boys who made it had all been hot-shots . " You got ta understand , " Howie would say , " because in a way , all these guys were so good that it frustrates them when they get to a point where somebody is better than they are . " Most old managers , holding forth like that , would have said " fucking better than they are . " But Howie never said fuck , nor variations thereof , and he never said shit . It was not that he was a prude or he had promised his mother this when he went off to play ball . It was just something he had decided himself , after a couple of years in the minors , that if he was going to stay in this all-male jock subculture , he would never be totally beholden to all its habits and mores . Probably no one ever even noticed that Howie Traveler did n't ever say fuck or shit . He never substituted anything asinine like " Oh , sugar " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell and goddammit and asshole and prick and sonuvabitch . It even amused some of his players when he screwed up , because then he would often say , " I got my tit caught in a wringer , " which was an expression that had mostly gone the way of white buck shoes .
