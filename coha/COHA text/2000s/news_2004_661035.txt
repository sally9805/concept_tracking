<p> There is a world in which showing up in person for a meeting is now the exception instead of the rule . A world where people can reach " partner " status at work and still be home to greet their children after school . A world where even single professionals without kids can choose to work part time . <p> It 's called the flexible workplace - a frontier where work and the rest of one 's life find a happy equilibrium . <p> Like any frontier , many people dream about it from a distance . And the ones who make it there often have to clear obstacles and make up new rules along the way . <p> Nevertheless , the American workplace is making progress in flexibility . In the process , employers are addressing a top concern among workers at a critical time in the economic cycle . If the job picture continues to improve , good employees will again be in short supply , forcing companies to find creative ways to attract and keep them . Addressing the work-life balance is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with any cultural change , progress is slow . " Sometimes companies need to have a personal experience to change the mind-set of presence at work equals productivity , " says Ellen Galinsky , president of the Families and Work Institute in New York . The institute 's recent report , " When Work Works , " highlights improvements in access to flexible work options - such as reduced workweeks , telecommuting from home , and long leaves of absence . But it also shows the gap between people 's needs or desires and the reality of their work life ( see box , below ) . For example : The study found that 79 percent of workers say they would like to have more flexibility . But 39 percent fear they would jeopardize their jobs or career advancement by using flexible work options . <p> That is why the institute and others are pushing employers to follow the pioneers of genuine flexibility - something that goes beyond marginal programs with a " mommy track " reputation . Congress is considering how better to help working families with the web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards . <p> Advocates never stray far from making the business case for flex time : Work-life balance is the top priority for 86 percent of employees , according to a study last year by Spherion , a recruiting and consulting firm in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . Turnover is expensive , and businesses need to prepare for an impending war for talent . Jobs are projected to outnumber workers by nearly 7 million in the coming decade , according to the Employment Policy Foundation in Washington . <p> While some companies have reduced flex benefits in recent years in the name of tight budgets , others warn that 's shortsighted . " Looking at demographics ... a smart business person sees it 's necessary , " says Jim Wall , national managing director for human resources at Deloitte &; Touche in New York . " If you have to drag some people kicking and screaming , so be it ... The old days are forever gone ... What we 've seen with the high-talent market is , they 'll leave for a place that is flexible . " <p> Aha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's company in the early 1990s , when managers realized how many people , especially women , were walking out the door because of a rigidity that their life circumstances could no longer bear . Even though women had been half the new hires for years , there were only seven of them in a group of 100 candidates for partner in 1992 . A year-long task force helped the company emphasize " a holistic view of the life of the staff " and the need to shift away from the idea that face time equals productivity , Wall says . Now about 35 percent of partner candidates are women . About 2,000 employees ( out of 30,000 ) are on reduced work schedules , and even 30 to 35 partners have flexible work arrangements . Turnover is down to 17 percent from 28 percent a decade ago . <p> Deloitte 's conversion also sped up after its offices were destroyed by the hijacked planes on 9/11 . Thanks to technology - and flexibility - the company was back serving clients within 24 hours . It became even clearer that employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly Hufton heard about Deloitte &; Touche 's efforts to retain women by offering more flexibility early in her career there . " I thought it would be all talk , " she says . Now , nearly 10 years later , she 's a believer . Three days a week she goes to the office in Chicago . For the other two she 's at home with her infant and her 2-1/2 year old , occasionally taking business calls when they nap . <p> The biggest challenge , says the self-labeled type-A personality , is making sure she does n't work much more than the 60 percent time she 's arranged . But the real test of her boss 's support came within the first six months of her part-time arrangement . Her day care shut down temporarily , and with no extended family in the area , she had to spend five weeks working from home . " I thought they 'd say , ' Forget it ! ' " she says , but they gave her backup and told her to do whatever she needed to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have quit , " Ms. Hufton says . Instead , she 's been promoted to senior manager . <p> Stories such as Hufton 's are promising , but far from universal . More than half of wage and salary workers do n't have options such as working part time , or choosing the time they start work in the morning . <p> One major concern is a lack of " onramps " for those who take time out to raise children and then want to reenter their careers . " Despite all the work-life happy talk in organizations , women are often penalized , " says Barbara Moses , a career consultant and author in Canada . " I 've seen them do all the right things - keep their skills up to date , stay in touch with their employer - and still , three years later they 're having trouble kick-starting their careers . " <p> In response , some companies are offering longer leaves of absence and creating more ways for people to stay up to speed while they 're away . But they 're careful not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mothers . <p> " We found that women were more vocal about flexibility , but men use it . It does n't even matter if you 're single or married - people are taking advantage of it in all walks of life , " says Jim Sinocchi , director of diversity communications for IBM , which offers an array of flexible work options and helped fund the Family and Work Institute 's study . <p> Elder care is a prime example of employees ' demands at home . Twenty-one percent of households have one person who cared for an aging individual in the past year , and of those caregivers , 59 percent were working at the same time , according to the Work &; Family Program of the New America Foundation , a public-policy institute in Washington . <p> And as baby boomers reach traditional retirement age , more employers are looking for ways to keep them engaged , even if only part time . <p> Then there are infinite individual reasons . " Sometimes people are just bored , " says Ms. Moses , citing the example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to spend a year taking art history and language classes in France . <p> Part-time success <p> For Peter Anderson , a single professional in Orlando , Fla. , balancing all his activities became a priority in the early 1990s . Between work , church commitments , and overseeing some family rental properties , he found himself scheduled seven days a week . So he asked his supervisor at Convergys , a global billing-services company , about scaling back his time to four days . He was one of the first nonparents in his office to go part time . <p> A few years into the arrangement , Mr. Anderson reduced his work - and his salary - again , to three days a week . He 's been offered promotions , but has turned them down because they 'd require a full-time schedule . " Having balance in my life is much more valuable than trying to squeeze more hours and more responsibility in , " he says . He 's impressed that the company has found other ways besides promotions to acknowledge his contributions - such as substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty to the company . " I do n't think I could replicate this , " he says . Because he built up his reputation for about five years before going part time , he would n't want to start over paying those dues somewhere else . <p> Changing mind-sets <p> Even in companies with leaders committed to work-life balance , changing mind-sets of some managers and full-time employees can be a lot of work . <p> " When someone is looking for a co-worker and they hear that they are at home that day , they are reluctant to call , but they need to understand that the person is working from home , " says John Veihmeyer , managing partner of the Washington , D.C. , office of accounting firm KPMG . <p> Telecommuting is one of the most-used flexibility tools in his office . Five years ago , he says , the culture would have dictated that workers be at their desks at 8:00 a.m. , even if an hour later they 'd have to drive nearly an hour back to an appointment near his home . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and working from home when it would be more productive , he says . <p> Telecommuting is also being promoted as a way to reduce the traffic congestion . In Washington , D.C. , area , the Greater Washington Board of Trade and the Council of Governments are striving to have 50,000 more people working at home ( or at telecommuting centers near home ) at least one day a week . <p> Some companies already have so many mobile workers that they create opportunities for human connection . Some Deloitte offices fly their remote workers in every third Friday . At IBM , where about 30 percent of employees are permanently mobile , the company sponsors socials and teas . " People want to feel like they belong to a community , " Mr. Sinocchi says . " There 's an effort now to go back and do some more of this high-touch stuff . " <p> Future work : a seven-day weekend ? <p> For decades , Semco has taken the meaning of workplace flexibility to new levels . At this Brazilian conglomerate , employees not only choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business to work for and even how much they 'll be paid . Because they share in the company 's profits , they 're motivated to make choices that improve productivity . Semco had $ 212 million in revenue in 2003 . Turnover among its 3,000 employees is about 1 percent . <p> Many executives from around the world have visited to see what makes Semco tick , but when CEO Ricardo Semler surveys the landscape of most workplaces , he sees slow progress on the flexibility front . Most , he says , are simply trying to manage a change forced upon them by computer technology that lets people work from anywhere . Rather than give up command-and-control management practices , they want software to track what remote workers are doing , he says . <p> " The essence to us at Semco was that people who are free people , who can act based on self-interest , who can balance their own lives , are much happier , more productive people , " he says in phone interview while he was away from his post as a visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business call on a Sunday afternoon , for instance , why not go to the movies on a Monday ? " <p> Semler , whose most recent book on Semco is titled " The Seven-Day Weekend : Changing the Way Work Works , " rejects the notion that people wo n't want to work if given freedom . <p> " There really are only two things people can do that make their lives worthwhile : work and love ... How many people know how not to work at all ? That 's a very rare competence , " he says . " I know at least a dozen or two independently wealthy people who could sit on beach or just roam around world ... and after a month they ca n't do it anymore . " <p> Of course , trendy programs in the name of flexibility wo n't necessarily improve the work culture , he adds . " It 's a bit like the casual-Friday thing ... To be a little bit flexible ... and at the same time have the rest of the organization be rigid , will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more flexible workplace will have to count on years of experimentation and implementation , which people do n't like to hear . " <p> The many paths to a flexible workplace <p> Workplace flexibility takes various forms and is gaining acceptance , says a Families and Work Institute report . Some forms are more popular than others . For example : <p> Flex time : In 1992 , 29 percent of workers could choose their starting and quitting time within a certain range of hours , and an additional 18 percent could choose on a daily basis . By 2002 , it was up to 43 percent and 23 percent , respectively . About 73 percent say they use their flex-time options . <p> Part time : 47 percent of workers can choose to work part time , but only 17 percent do so . Of those who work full time , 18 percent would prefer to work part time . ( Among women , 24 percent have this preference . ) <p> Compressed workweeks : 42 percent can choose to work the same number of hours in 4 or 4-1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among workers with compressed workweeks , favorable ratings for work/life balance went up to 57 percent from 45 percent , according to a study by Prof. Allen Kraut of Baruch College in New York City . ) <p> Work at home/telecommuting : 2 percent work primarily from home ; 9 percent work from home for part of every week ; 43 percent say they 'd like to have this option . <p> Paid time off : 58 percent of high-wage employees and 28 percent of low-wage employees have paid time off to care for children . <p> Informal flexibility : 63 percent say it is " not hard at all " or " not too hard " to take time off during the day to address personal issues . Women spend an average of 40 minutes each workday online for nonwork activity , such as banking and e-mailing friends . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
