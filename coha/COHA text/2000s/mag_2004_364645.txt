George W. Bush arrives in Europe next week to commemorate the glorious victory over fascism that began with D-day , but let 's face it : this does n't feel like a time for celebration . The 60th anniversary of the Atlantic alliance 's greatest triumph comes at the lowest point in its history . The inevitable comparison  --  between the righteous , successful American-led invasion and occupation of Europe and the divisive , troubled American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq  --  will surely launch a thousand newspaper columns . <P> When Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair gather in Normandy with the leaders of Canada , France , Germany , Russia and 10 other countries , all will praise the achievements of history 's most durable alliance . But Iraq will never be far from their minds . Bush and Blair saw Iraq as a key battle in the defining struggle of our times  --  the war on terrorism  --  but failed to persuade most of their principal allies or the European public . and as most Europeans see it now , the failure to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only confirmed the wisdom of their opposition to the war . President Bush does not accept a single element of this critique . Yet his administration , which originally disdained help from countries that doubted him , now would welcome their soldiers and money . But help is not on the way . France and Germany have made it clear that they wo n't send troops , and last week German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said he had " doubts " about whether any NATO forces should go . Britain is reluctant to send more soldiers . <P> All this leaves the alliance in need of medicine much stronger than the bromides likely to be doled out on June 6 . If the grand partnership that beat the Nazis and the U.S.S.R. Is going to last , it must find its way to common ground . There 's no better place to start the search than Normandy , and no better time than now . The allies meet three times in the next month , not only for mood music in France but also for substance at a g-8 summit on Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Istanbul . George Robertson , the British former NATO secretary-general , says that " with everyone in the same room at the same time , they wo n't be able to run away from the problems . " Do n't expect a Marshall Plan for the Middle East by the end of June , but if leaders want to begin healing the alliance , here are a few things they should try .
