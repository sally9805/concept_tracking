Cruisers Yachts was on a mission to build the roomiest cruiser in its class . The result is the new 330 Express . IN A PERFECT WORLD , WE 'D ALL BE FAST AND graceful on our feet , which means we could effortlessly negotiate even the slimmest sidedeck and make our way forward with lines well in hand and our dignity intact . In the real world , though , some of us cling to the rails wearing the terrified expression of a person who may as well have just found himself standing out on the window ledge of a very tall building . I 'm one of those people who will always warn the driver that I 'm stepping onto the side deck , simply because I was born with two big , clumsy left feet . For this reason , I really enjoyed my ride aboard the new Cruisers Yachts 330 Express . With the 330 , Cruisers wanted to build the roomiest express cruiser in its class . One of the ways the company managed to maximize space inside and out was by eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk-through section at the windshield , something you do n't find on all express boats in this size range . It 's a good arrangement for those owners who worry about the safety of uncoordinated crew , and it 's also a logical set up for the person who often operates the boat on his own . To get forward in a hurry , either to clear the windlass or throw a line to a dockhand , the driver takes just a few steps up from the helm . To make the arrangement even more workable , amidships cleats are bolted in locations that can be reached from inside the cockpit  --  you just have to stretch around the radar arch a bit . The real benefit of no sidedecks is the space gained inside the cabin , which can sleep up to six people . Cruisers is particularly proud of the forward pedestal berth . It 's a true queen that you can step around . Because it 's not sandwiched up against bulkheads on three sides , you can wake up in the morning and actually swing your legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the berth and hopping off the end . The builder also managed to carve out space for a huge stowage bin beneath the berth . On top of that , the 330 's salon feels wider than the boat 's 11 ' ' 8 " beam and it 's brightened by oversized ports that put a modern spin on the styling . These are just some of the ways Cruisers makes the interior more comfortable . One of the things that struck me about the 330 was its genuine practicality . It 's not the kind of boat you 're going to find a lot of trick features on  --  there 's no helm joystick , no iPod docking station and I counted just one flat-screen TV  --  but it 's built with the equipment and features that can make your time on the water safe and very pleasant . The standard equipment list , for instance , includes both an air conditioner and a windlass ; add the optional genset to create the kind of trinity devout boaters worship . The 330 Express is offered with V-drives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's good news , since many boaters have a preference for one system . In recent years , the performance differences between the two have narrowed , but each has distinct advantages . The sterndrives perform a bit more nimbly and fuel efficiently , while V-drives tend to be smoother and quieter , and , over time , require less maintenance . Our test boat was powered by Volvo V-drives ( 375 hp each ) . With this power , the 330 seems to run best at 3500 rpm : speed is 29 mph and range is about 200 miles ( 27 gph ) . Top-end speed is 38.9 mph . According to Cruisers , the sterndrive version of the 330 should be about 6 mph faster . The engine options are complemented by excellent , practical access to propulsion . There 's a removable hatch in the bulkhead of the aft cabin that makes it very easy for the owner to reach fills , filters and the like . This is another one of those features that make you wonder why your cruiser does n't have one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF .
