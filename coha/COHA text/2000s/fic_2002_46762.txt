Dimitri and I are half-naked when the woman shows up with the dogs . He is sitting up and I am astride him , my dress around my waist . What we had thought to be a secluded park looking out on an all-but-abandoned pond is actually someone 's backyard . <p> " We 're clean-living people here , " the woman says . Then the low constant growling of the two dogs straining their leashes . Pit bulls , she tells us , as we grab for our scattered belongings . She lets the dogs get a little closer . One bares his teeth not far from my shoulder . The other is at Dimitri 's ankles . " This is a family neighborhood . I mean , I do n't know where you people come from but ... ' <p> " I understand , ma'am , I understand , " Dimitri says , reaching for his shirt , which I had removed moments before and tossed onto a bush . " We 're terribly sorry . " He has a deep voice , a sexy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case no good . The woman lets the leash out a little more . <p> " The filth , " she says . " The filth that comes into this neighborhood . " <p> We stand up . " Do n't give it another thought , ma'am , " Dimitri says . " Please do n't give it another thought . " <p> " Do n't what ? ! " she asks . One of the dogs has a perfect stream of saliva hanging from its hot pink tongue . <p> " Do n't give it another thought , " he repeats , taking my hand , and we run for the parking lot and his car , fueled by adrenaline and shame . She does n't come after us . There is some barking , but that 's all . We sit in his car , silent and breathing hard . Not far away , children are singing the jump-rope song . Mary Mary Bobary , Banana Fanna Fofana ... <p> I lean my head against the back of the seat . <p> " What time is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two o'clock , " I tell him . " Has your watch stopped ? " <p> " My father 's Rolex , " he says , taking the watch off and holding it up to his ear . " It 's one of the few things I have from him . " His voice gets shaky and his eyes tear a little whenever he mentions his father , who died six years ago , suddenly and from a heart attack . No time to say goodbye . On this and many other things , Dimitri is a man who lacks closure . <p> " I hope that woman does n't remember you , " I say . Dimitri is planning to run for a judgeship in this district , just as his father once did . Family court . To be considered for the nomination , he recently changed his party affiliation to Republican . <p> " Do n't worry ; " Dimitri says . " It 's not like she knows my name or anything . " <p> I am surprised he 's so calm-usually he 's obsessed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised on it . Pays his taxes early , cries if he ca n't make his daughter 's dance recital , does not understand , even scorns , sex without love . As a lawyer , he takes on more than the requisite pro bono work ; he prosecutes deadbeat dads and has gotten large alimonies out of rich wife-beaters . His one weakness : sex in dangerous places , often outdoors . He is never more potent than when he fears public humiliation . This time is no different . I reach over and unzip his pants . <p> " It should n't take long " he whispers , knowing I have a train to catch . <p> I first met Dimitrius Quaid three years ago on an Amtrak train bound for Buffalo . I was going to a suburb of Albany for the weekend to visit my college roommate , Debra , married with a new baby . When the train pulled out of Penn Station , the early spring afternoon was sunny and cloudless , but the farther we got from Manhattan , the darker everything became . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five o'clock , the sky was the color of midnight . Then the storm came all at once , and a wind so powerful , it flung the rain against the windows in violent sheets . <p> Dimitri sat in front of me . We were each alone in our rows , me by the window and he by the aisle . I 'd noticed him when I got on . His long legs were spread out , and he 'd had to move them for me to pass . He looked up , and we smiled at each other for a moment-long enough for me to note that he was almost but not quite handsome , with blue-black hair and very pale skin . There was something shocking about his face , dramatic and off-putting : the thick , heavy arch of his eyebrows , long , dominant nose , full lips . We spoke not a word to each other until just outside Hudson , when the train came to a grinding halt and all the lights went out . <p> " My cell is n't working , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face leaning towards me . He smelled of vanilla aftershave and Ivory soap . " Could I borrow yours ? " he asked . <p> Neither of us had service . <p> " Well , " he said . " At least no one will yell at me for a little while . " <p> " Do people often yell at you ? " I asked . <p> " Clearly you 're not married , " he said . " No . <p> " And you 're not an attorney . " <p> " Also no . " <p> A man entered our car just then , the intercom was out . We were waiting for the storm to pass , he said . There was a tornado in Massachusetts , just hours away . No telling how long we 'd be . Then he left , amid moans of frustration , and threats , as there always were such threats , to sue Amtrak . <p> Our conversation started haltingly , then moved at a rapid pace , from his ambition to pursue a career in politics to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical fish ( he claimed that staring into the tank calmed his nerves before court ) to our shared love of movies from the 1940 's . Our lives were a series of almost intersecting coincidences . We both loved Delphyn 's , a Greek restaurant in Manhattan on 85th and Columbus . Dimitri lived upstate but had a few big clients in the city , kept an apartment on the Upper West Side , blocks from mine , and ate at Delphyn 's on Wednesdays ; I usually went there on Tuesdays . My mother and his father went to the same high school in Atlantic City , New Jersey . We were born on the same day in June , four years apart . <p> By then , he had long ago moved to my row . He told me his full name , Dimitrius Quaid . Half Greek and half Irish . I have always been attracted to half-breeds , to the mixing of cultures . Perhaps it 's because my own large extended family , the Liebermans , are ridiculously inbred . Too many cousins with cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncle with a niece . We look alike and are all near-sighted . Though an only child , I am also the baby of the family-grew up encircled by older relatives-so that the faces I looked into always reflected a little too much of my own expression back at me . First chance I got , I ran to Manhattan , in search of the freedom that comes from being surrounded by millions of strangers . There can be such a thing , I told him , as too much intimacy . <p> I know exactly what you mean , he said , but would not elaborate . Strangely , our opposite antecedents had produced similar characteristics : dark , dramatic features ; feuding families ; a tendency towards careless behavior ; insanity ; guilt . There was one particularly curious difference between our families , though : whereas mine , whose gene pool was weak and overbred , should have been rife with chronic diseases , we , in fact , were blessed with tremendous longevity . And his family-which should have been healthy and strong from combining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived past the age of sixty-five . " Heart disease , " he said , and was silent . <p> I asked him then how long he 'd been married . " Ten years " he replied . He and his wife , Beth , had met in law school . They had a daughter , Lucy . <p> " How old is she ? " <p> " Ten , " he said . <p> Months later , I realized how odd it was that he told me the story so quickly in our acquaintance , admitted , straight away , that he and Beth were n't married when they conceived Lucy . Usually he lied and said they 'd been married the extra year , for whose business was it ? He was not a sharer of his own secrets . But for some reason he told me the rest that night . <p> They were both at NYU . When Beth realized she was pregnant , a friend told her about that abortion place in the Thirties on Park . Every woman in Manhattan knows the address , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriends over the years , women who still got a little too drunk at parties and occasionally went off with the wrong man , or the condom broke , or they were married but just could n't afford another child . The abortions were legal , safe , and cheap , the women desperate and grateful . But there was a rushed carelessness about the place , how they put you all together in a big room , like a classroom , like high school health , with a podium in front , about thirty pregnant women and the people accompanying them . Almost always , women showed up with other women . Few men came along . <p> He had been , that day , one of the few . Beth was miserable , biting her nails to the bleeding cuticles , had n't slept in days . He could hardly bear to look at her face , the lower lids red from sleeplessness and crying . Roman Catholic , she was , European parents , parochial school upbringing . She could n't even say the word abortion . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked it of her and she was willing to comply , were it not for that room where they kept you sitting for so long , then a receptionist came out and called your name in front of everyone . Every time Beth heard a name , she winced . After an hour , Dimitri could n't take it anymore . He leaned over and whispered in her ear that if she wanted to change her mind , they could go . <p> She was up and heading to the door before he finished his sentence . They walked up Park Avenue and then drifted west , towards the diamond district in the Forties . He claimed it had n't been his intention at all , but that walk more or less cinched their future . Her face , he said , when she saw the rings in the windows . What she 'd wanted of him all along . They were engaged by the end of the day , married two months later . He told himself , on the wedding day , that it was good for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reach seventy , to marry young , reproduce quickly . Leave someone behind . <p> This seemed to me a morbid approach to marriage , but I did n't realize then the extent to which mortality hung over Dimitri Quaid . He clung to assumed knowledge of his own life span , believing he had to squeeze everything-from passionate love to stellar professional standing , from devoted husband to remarkable father-into fewer years than most people . He assumed he would die young of a heart attack , he told me , like his father and grandfather , just as I assumed I had , always , time to burn . <p> " Is it a happy ending ? Your marriage ? " I asked , knowing full well the answer . A man does n't tell a woman a story like that on a darkened train if he 's happy , if he has someone to confide in , if he has n't thought a million times of what might have happened ten years ago if he 'd walked towards the Village instead of uptown . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock . " So what about you ? " he asked . " Tell me more about yourself . " <p> Before I could say a word about visiting Debra from college , or how I wanted to leave my firm and strike out on my own but did n't have the courage , not to mention my string of unsuccessful , casual , or careless relationships-in short , before I could lay out my whole life for him like a banquet of indecision and ambivalence-a giant lightning bolt flashed in the distance , long and perfect , glowing silver . <p> Our car was silent as the sky crashed and sizzled . Several smaller lightning bolts followed , momentarily illuminating his face close to mine . Then he leaned over and kissed me . His lips were soft and full , a bit cold . <p> The lights came on in the train . <p> We retreated , startled , to our respective corners . I was squeezing the armrest so tightly that my hand hurt . He ran his fingers through his hair . We took sidelong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were strangers . I reviewed his face and found it kinder this time . The eyebrows were strong , but his large gray-blue eyes were soft , with tiny laugh lines in the corners . A voice came over the intercom . " We will be moving shortly . We apologize for any inconvenience ... ' <p> " What 's your final destination ? " he whispered . The rain slowed , was not coming down in hard sheets now , but instead beat rhythmically against the roof . <p> " Rensselaer , " I said . " The last name 's Gessup . Tom and Debra Gessup . " <p> The train began to move . <p> " I 'm just outside Schenectady , " he said . " Niskayuna . Not so far from there . I get off first . " <p> We said nothing else until his stop . <p> " I hope you do n't think I do this sort of thing often , " he said , getting up . <p> " What sort of thing ? " I asked . " Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He never got to finish . The doors opened , people pushed for the exit-ours was the only one for several cars-and he had no choice but to go with them , carried away by the tide . <p> For the next two days of that trip , my friend Debra sang the virtues of upstate living . <p> " Everyone here is fat , " she told me . " It 's wonderful . You can gain sixty pounds in a pregnancy , and no one notices . " <p> Is that a reason to leave Manhattan ? I asked her . <p> In the city , Debra had been an ad copywriter at a big midtown agency . Then she became an account exec , and was about to make VP when she met Tom , an architect from Accord , New York . The Debra I knew then got $200 haircuts , had a personal trainer , and a guy at The New York Look who picked out all her clothes . She never ate dessert . The woman who sat in front of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face broken out , her hair overgrown and askew . <p> " People stay married here , " she said . " You can buy a house for what a studio costs in the city . Nobody gets Botox injections ; they embrace their wrinkles . It 's the real America . " <p> The baby had stopped nursing , and Debra eased her nipple away , buttoned up her bra , and told me that she could n't wait to get a nanny . " I love her , " she said , glancing down at Claire , four months , two weeks . " But I feel like I have n't been out of this house in years . " <p> This was the lament of all my nursing friends : time stopped . They wondered who and where they were , as if living in a dream , locked with their newborn in a mysterious , powerful dance . Watching them filled me with a combination of fascination and repulsion , horror and awe . <p> " It 's worth it , " Debra told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slinging her over her shoulder and patting her on the back . " The problem with you , Annie , " she said . " Do you mind me telling you what your problem is ? " <p> " Go right ahead . " From the time I passed thirty , I 'd begun to get a lot of advice from my married women friends . I did n't mind so much . Most of them had put their careers on hold and were now at home with small children and Elmo videos . On the whole they no longer had love affairs , which take up a lot of thought and energy . They saw fixing my life as a challenge . It kept their minds sharp , like doing the Times crossword puzzle . <p> " The problem is that you back into everything . I 've never seen you really go after a man or a job or even an apartment . You just take what 's offered to you and live with the consequences until you get sick of them , then you take the next thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It 's a strategy , " I said . <p> " For disaster , " she said . " You think you 're going to be young forever ? " <p> Claire gave a loud , aggressive burp . " Let me hold her , " I said , and put out my arms . She smelled of baby shampoo and pure sweet baby smell . I kissed the edge of her ear . <p> " Do you want kids ? " Debra asked . " You 've never talked about that . " <p> " I do n't know , " I said , leaning Claire on the crook of my arm . She grasped my finger hard and pulled . I wanted to tell Debra that I did n't think a baby was one of those things you could aggressively go after . Like an apartment or a job or a share in the Hamptons . I wanted to tell her that for two days I 'd thought of nothing but the married man who 'd kissed me on the train . And so , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Wednesday , when I knew he 'd be there , instead of on the Tuesday when I usually went , was that backing into life , or going after something I wanted ? Did I want what I thought I wanted ? In waiting for life to come to me , I was also , in a certain way , in control . I could say yes or no to what came my way and take no responsibility for failure , because I did not actively court disaster . I courted nothing . I wanted to ask her about all those things , but I did n't , because I knew exactly what she 'd say . She 'd say , Take a risk , for God 's sakes , but not with a married man . Taking a relationship risk with a married man is like taking no risk at all . Then the baby started to shriek , and I handed her back . <p> He only likes to take chances upstate . <p> Two weeks have passed since the incident with the woman and the dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief . " This is getting crazy , " I whisper into the darkness . " You are about to run for public office . In a conservative district . " <p> He is silent . <p> " If you 're so unhappy , then ask for a divorce , do n't bring one upon yourself , " I say . " Like this . " <p> " There 's Lucy , " he whispers . " She 's too young . I ca n't do that to her . There are no children of divorce in her class . " <p> " What year is this ? " I ask him . " Where am I ? " I hear a faint shushing noise in front of us . <p> " Even if I could do that to Lucy , " he says , " Beth would never want a divorce . She 'd make my life a living hell . " He pauses . " You and I are like Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn . " <p> " You 're no Spencer Tracy , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " True , " he whispers . " She 'd never give me a blowjob in theater four at the Schenectady Octaplex . " <p> Downstate , he never wants to take risks . Central Park is too urban , the landscape does n't appeal to him . The subways are too dirty , he says , the movie theaters too small and crowded . Here 's what I think is the real reason : in Manhattan , if you 're discovered having sex in public , there 's a big chance no one will give a damn . <p> In Manhattan we 're free . For three years we 've been free . We see each other Wednesday nights , and usually he stays over until Thursday . Sometimes when he can swing it , he takes the train down on a Friday and stays until Saturday . Mostly we stay at his place , sometimes at mine . We always go to excellent restaurants , sometimes meet my friends-my single friends-for dinner . Sometimes he ca n't stay-birthdays , in-laws , or , most often , a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for openings at the Whitney , Broadway shows , and other things that require planning . So I long ago stopped planning . He 's always gone for New Year 's but never for our shared birthday . Somehow , then , he manages to get away . My mother thinks I have n't had a date in three years . Sometimes she gets choked up when I talk to her on the phone . She told my aunt I 'm probably a lesbian . <p> Still , after all this time , when he walks through the door , my heart is bursting . I can feel it in there , expanding with each beat . At night in bed , he measures the length of me , running his index finger along my spine until I 'm shaking . Some nights we attack each other , hungry from our endured separation . Other times , I slide into his arms and inhale , ready for the most dreamless and wonderful of sleeps . His hair is thick and black , his beard always scratchy , but his skin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When he wins a case , which is most of the time , he 'll call from the courthouse , or his car or office , to tell me the size of the settlement . Often he 'll go into the details , leaving out the names of the clients . There 's the twenty-year-old stripper who married her sixty-year-old boss ; in the first year of marriage , he broke so many of her bones that she 's now suing him for divorce and worker 's comp . There are the parents , rich enough to hire teams of expensive lawyers , who lose custody for trying to force-feed their children drugs , or for accidentally leaving them outside the supermarket and driving away . And then my favorites , the marriages of upstanding citizens-kindergarten teachers , church organists , social workers-that end over someone refusing to be urinated on , beaten with a metal paddle , or included in a threesome with a sibling . Bondage , it 's amazing how many marriages end because of bondage . <p> Once , he calls from his car and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pull over to the side of the road . He has lost the case . Such times are rare . I know then that there must be custody involved , a decent father is going to be restricted from seeing a child , for only these cases push him to the brink , haunt and obsess him . I utter words of comfort about how hard he works , about how he has n't slept in weeks , preparing , and what else could he do ? I sound so banal , and yet after I repeat myself a few times , he seems calmer , perhaps because I know , without his having to say it , the real roots of his emotion : Lucy . <p> He gets back on the road , thanking me , saying he loves me , and then the line crackles and goes out for a moment , the connection suddenly tenuous . <p> " Listen , baby , " he says . " I 'm pulling into the driveway now . I 'm home . Got ta go . " I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythmic . You promised , Dad , she says . You promised to take me for ice cream . Then the empty dick of the receiver . <p> I hang up , look around at the four walls of my studio apartment , then remember what Dimitri said once , about how we are like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy . I have always loved the famous story about the proud and independent Hepburn  --  fearless wearer of men 's trousers , determined controller of her film roles-kneeling at Tracy 's feet to remove his shoes after a long day on the set . It occurs to me just then that there must have been days not mentioned in her biography , days when , expecting him as usual , there was no knock on her trailer door . And what about the evenings when she placed her hands on the smooth leather and pulled-revealing his socks , then the soft and vulnerable instep that only she was allowed so close to-and was told that he had to go home . Home , the word reserved for the place you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has to spend even more time in Albany preparing for his campaign . He calls often and begs me to visit . He needs me , he says , to help him get through the stress of this election . I remind him , yet again , that my presence upstate is dangerous for him , then review the many cautionary tales of politicians brought down by affairs , but he refuses to acknowledge that anything bad could come of our love . Oh , how I want to believe him , yet I feel a sense of impending doom . And fear , there is always fear-mixed more than I like to admit , with fantasy and desire-that I will be the one , without meaning to , who brings down his house , and maybe even his upstate career . Leaving him with no alternative but to choose me , and move . <p> I stay at a small hotel in Schenectady , a bed and breakfast owned by an elderly couple , Jane and Howard Winter , who allow their cat her own seat at the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my grandmother 's closet . Someone in Dimitri 's office recommended this place . He likely wanted something that felt more like a home than a hotel . When we 're not being completely careless , he worries about dignity , about how best to treat me well . He knows this is a tricky business . <p> There are doilies on the bureau , and black-and-white photos of Albany at the turn of the century line the walls in dust-encrusted frames . Friday morning , I sit up , completely awake at seven a.m. with no idea what to do until one , when I 'm meeting Dimitri for lunch . The shades on the windows throw a dull , brown light across the bed , and I catch a glimpse of myself in an oak-framed mirror with a big crack down the center . My hair is standing up at odd angles , and I look tired and old , scowling , aware of every line and crease pulling me towards middle age . Looking around the room , I feel like I 've woken up in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women about whom everyone says , What a waste ? <p> I show up at Debra 's house two hours later , having told her that the dust at the B &B; is aggravating my allergies and can I have breakfast with her and stay for a few hours ? <p> " No lectures , please , " I say , crossing the threshold with my overnight bag . Debra stands in the doorway of her contemporary split-level , her arms folded across her chest . She is five months pregnant , and her belly peeks out from under her folded arms . Claire , who is now walking and talking , about to begin preschool , sits in front of the television watching Barney . <p> Tom is not home , she tells me . He never seems to be home , as people are building and building in this part of the state , the great migration from Manhattan . For a moment I comfort myself , How is Debra 's life any different from mine ? She sees her husband for an hour in the morning and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his attention ? But then I look around the living room at the plush white bears and piles of children 's books , the overstuffed couches and groupings of pictures on the wall : Debra and Tom 's wedding , Claire 's first step , a family vacation to the Grand Canyon . And it occurs to me how much my life resembles that of a clever spy , a good criminal , an amnesia victim : there is no clutter and no documentation . <p> We sit down to tea in the kitchen , and Debra offers me a croissant but declines to take one herself . She looks annoyed , slams her mug down on the table , and I wonder if I 'd have been better off eating breakfast with Mr. and Mrs. Winter and the cat , who sits up on her hind legs and waits for her omelet with remarkable deportment . Claire comes into the kitchen asking for a cookie . I hand her one from the tin on the table , and she nibbles on it for a moment , then puts her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pull her onto me . Older now , she smells of bubblegum and fabric softener . She sucks her cookie and asks me if I like Teletubbies . Before I can answer she slithers off . Her love comes in flashes , then she 's gone , onto her next task . My own parents had one child , and I , too , had only to put my arms out to dip into their constant , hovering attention , like an embarrassment of riches . They had been married for seven years when I was born . A biblical number . And they saw me as a kind of miracle , their lives focused on my every movement and expression . Debra 's parents divorced when she was three , her mother moved her across the country , away from her father . Where I have feared commitment , loss of freedom , she has sought stability , continuity . And then there 's Dimitri , seeking a little bit of both . What exactly , I wonder , was going on in his house ? <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way too caught up with videos and product branding " says Debra , sounding like she did back in her advertising days . " I think my child is bored ! <p> " I think her mother is bored , " I say . <p> " No one told me motherhood could be so boring , " she says . <p> " And lonely . " <p> " But you 're having another one ? " <p> " I want her to have someone , " she says , her glance a little too penetrating . " She 's already too comfortable playing alone . " <p> I do not reply . <p> " Are you tired of all this yet ? " Debra asks . " All this running around , pretending . For God 's sake , you 're thirty-six . How much more time do you have to waste ? " <p> " I love him , " I tell her . " Honestly , when I met him on the train that time , I never imagined I 'd feel this way . " I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effortlessness of our connection . <p> " Plus we ca n't keep our hands off each other . " <p> Debra sighs . " I remember when Tom and I were like that , " she says . " Before Claire was born . Before he started working six days a week . " <p> I can see on her sad face , as she can see in mine , the following question : Why is there no perfect way ? Why is a secure marriage so little like a romantic , passionate affair ? Why does a romantic , passionate affair so rarely lead to the security of marriage ? <p> I stand in Dimitri 's upstate office , waiting for him to take me to lunch . Against the back wall is his tank of tropical fish . I look at the Tiger Barbs and a strange-looking black blob , his favorite , the Ghost Knife . Blind and dependent on sonar , it moves slowly , hesitantly , and mostly travels backwards . Last summer , Dimitri started out with three of them in the tank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd joked , have a short life span . <p> " I 'm sorry , are you starving ? " he asks , looking over some papers . He sits in a wide leather desk chair . " I 'll be finished in a moment , I promise . ' But then the intercom buzzes again , and he takes the call , leans back and stares out the window . <p> " I told you , if I do n't see those discovery documents by four , " he says . " You 're lucky I do n't haul you in front of Judge Dunbar ! Now you know I 'm right and you 're trying to fuck me up the ass and you also know I 'm not going to let you ... ' <p> Dimitri goes on like this , loud and menacing . I have heard this side of him before , seen him in the courtroom , confident , brash , taking up space and height , but still the tone shocks me a little . The lawyer is aggressive and domineering , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wraps his arms and legs around me as if he 's drowning ; sometimes while dreaming he will call out the words " I do n't know " over and over again , like a chant . Here in this room , though , he is altogether different . I wonder what he is like at home . He plans to make one of those local TV commercials for his campaign . I imagine him and Beth and Lucy in front of their three-story house , holding hands . " Albany 's families matter , " he says , and the camera pans into a close-up . <p> I pick up a school picture of Lucy on the desk . She is a small feminine version of Dimitri , pretty with huge gray-blue eyes and thick eyebrows . She is not happy about having to be on television , Dimitri has told me . Perhaps because she looks so much like her father , or perhaps because Lucy , too , is an only daughter , her life spliced between the disappointments and desires of her two parents , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that day Dimitri told me about in the abortion clinic and how , back then , having a child felt to him like the ruination of his life . And I suddenly fear , putting Lucy 's picture back on the desk , that there will come a time for me when not having a child will feel exactly the same way . <p> At lunch , he tells me about all the people who are sure he can win . He wishes Albany were like Manhattan , where family court judges are appointed by the mayor and that 's that , but I can tell he 's excited for a fight . He 's taken up golf and now plays with various public officials , committeemen , higher court judges . He tries to tell me how he 'll manage , with his practice and the judgeship . How he 'll divide up the time . Suddenly he sounds uncertain , even a little sad . <p> " What 's the matter ? " I ask . <p> " I 'm a damned good lawyer , and maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , leans across the table , takes my hand . " If I get this I 'll have less time in the city , " he says . " That 's the biggest thing that makes me feel . reluctant . " <p> I tell him we 'll figure something out . He wants this so much , and so I want it for him . <p> " Maybe you could move up here , " ' he says . <p> " What would I do ? " I imagine myself in this land of married forever , minor league baseball , and pastel fabrics . The lone single woman in Niskayuna , New York . <p> " I 'm sure they 'd let you work from home , " he says . " Or you can start your own company . You always talk about that , you know it 's what you want . " <p> " If I go off on my own " I say , " then I really have to be in Manhattan . ' <p> " That 's ridiculous , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " <p> Then he tells me a story . Finally , a story of his own childhood , for he rarely refers to it in any real way . About his now dead father , whose secretary lived with them when Dimitri was growing up . She had an apartment above the garage . <p> " Your father 's secretary lived in your house ? " <p> " Yes , " he says . " She sometimes babysat for us when my parents went out . Other times , she and my father went on long business trips , and we were alone with my mother . Her name was Ellen . We loved her . She was enormous fun and very beautiful . She taught me to play chess . " He pauses . " She never married . " <p> " Did this upset her ? " I ask , starting to feel a little sick . <p> " No , she was a very happy person . She was remembered , " he says . " In the will . " <p> " How about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He is momentarily quiet . I see him thinking of his father , and of the sudden heart attack that claimed him on the golf course . His dad was with two men he barely knew , Dimitri tells me , business acquaintances . Neither of the women he loved were close-by , neither of them were able to hold the dying man 's hand or say goodbye . Dimitri looks at me and adds : " I think my mother came to understand ? " <p> Suddenly I am old and bitter and living over someone else 's drafty garage in a room full of doilies and cracked mirrors and brown shades . Nothing is my own , everything belongs to someone else . This is n't Edith Wharton , I think . This is Stephen King . " You all right ? " he asks . " You do n't look so good . " <p> I nod , but all I want is to get back to Manhattan . I want to wake up in my dark , cramped apartment and go to my annoying office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , can he drop me off ? <p> " Forget what I said before , about Ellen , about moving up here . Just forget it , " he says , taking out his gold card . " I thought , somehow , the idea would make you happy . " <p> " Only if I lived in Utah . " I get up without him , walk towards the door . <p> On the way to the station , he frowns and looks miserable . <p> " I hate when you stop talking and get all moody , " he says . I see my face reflected momentarily in the car mirror . My hair is a mess , my lipstick smeared . How could he let me walk around like this ? I take out a compact and begin to fix myself up . Dimitri pulls into a parking lot across from the station , then leans over the steering wheel and puts his face in his hands . His voice escapes from between his fingers in low gasps . " I 've made a mess of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to be done about it . " <p> I feel sympathy for him , even as I 'm still angry . He really thinks it 's best to try and please all of us a little bit , even if he ca n't please any one of us completely . He really thinks that by doing nothing he is doing something . He has no idea why he keeps tempting fate in parks and movie theaters , endangering his family , reputation , and career , or why , six years later , he is still mourning his father as if the man died yesterday . He told me recently that he 's thinking about calling one of those people who contact the dead . So he can know where his father is , and if he 's all right . But now I understand that Dimitri really wants to ask his father what to do about us , how to handle it , how to live his life loving two women at the same time . We are alike , he and I , hoping time or circumstance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide for ourselves . <p> " It 's all right , baby , " I say , and put my fingers on his , pull his hands away from his face . His eyes are wet , his skin even paler than usual . <p> " I ca n't lose us , " he whispers . I draw his face towards me , and we kiss and kiss , hungry and afraid . There are forty minutes before your train , he says . He starts the engine and mentions the park we were looking for weeks ago , when we got lost and met up with the woman and the dogs . " It 's five minutes from here , " he says . " Come on , I can find it this time . Come on , Annie . " <p> He looks optimistic again , full of energy . His old deluded self . When he gets like this , I ca n't refuse him . For even angry and annoyed , confused , afraid , I still want to make him happy . That is love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there in minutes , standing at the edge of a large pond enclosed by rows of trees and bushes . It 's fully spring now , warm and sunny , though there 's been some rain . No one is in sight , not even another car in the parking lot . Dimitri takes off his raincoat and lays it on the grass . In moments we are rolling around on his coat and then on the wet earth , tugging at each other 's clothes . <p> We are back to where we started , yet again , back to where we always begin . I inhale Dimitri 's smell of vanilla and soap , feel the rhythm of his breath on my neck , look into his eyes turning just then from gray to pale blue . Time stops , I do n't know if a minute or an hour passes . I close my eyes , and when I open them , a man is staring down at us , his face fleshy , expressionless . <p> " Baby , " I whisper in Dimitri 's ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The policeman looks extremely tall from this angle , with a chunk of blond hair falling in his narrow blue eyes . His nostrils are flared , his lips thin . A stick is fastened to his belt . I think of a retort we used in high school-What are you , the morality police ? <p> Dimitri rolls off me , his face pink , his fingers fumbling with his zipper . I cover myself in his coat , reaching behind to re-hook my bra and quickly rearrange my clothes . <p> " Dimitri ? " the policeman asks . " Dimitri Quaid ? Counselor ? " Dimitri tries to get the whole thing forgotten , smiles , brings up a captain they both know . But there is no budging , this guy is a rookie and all business . " I 'm sorry , " the policeman says . " I wo n't cuff you , but you 'll both have to come to the station . " Someone not far from here filed a complaint , he tells us . A cop 's wife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copulating on her lawn , and we fit the description . " We take public nudity very seriously here , " he says . " No offense or anything . " <p> Disregard for public standards of decency , obscene behavior in an area trafficked by minors . Something like that , I 'm not paying attention because the policeman is leading me to a squad car . He opens the door , and I duck tentatively , awkwardly inside . I hear Debra 's words in my mind : You back into everything . Even breaking the law . I look through the smudged window at the abandoned factories and gray office buildings , the narrow , congested row homes of downtown Albany . The state capital looks barren , hopeless , and depressed . <p> In minutes , the squad car pulls into a driveway and stops . We are only blocks from the park , the train station , Dimitri 's office . You ca n't go too far in this town , everything is connected , close . I look across the seat at Dimitri , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingernails , his lips , all his worst displays of anxiety , but he looks calmer than I 've ever seen him . There is color in his cheeks , and he turns , looks me in the eye , and smiles . Finally , his face says , a verdict will be pronounced , public and irrevocable . He will suffer and be forgiven , or he will be abandoned , shamed , and left for me to love , but either way , I realize , I am the fallback , and either way , once again , neither of us has made a decision , only waited for one to come to us . <p> But of course , it 's not too late . Dimitri is removed from his side of the car , and I watch the policeman walk him around , both of them coming to get me . When , I wonder , did my life become somebody else 's morality tale ? When did I learn to ask for so little ? The doors open , and the policeman reaches down to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression I can see the future : the station house , where everyone knows Dimitri ; our names in the papers ; his opponent 's certain victory in the election ; the disappointed little girl who will see me forever as the woman who ruined her life . And her father , stripped of everything he loves but me . Here 's the thing about married mistresses-they , too , can become resented wives . Standing on the sidewalk , just blocks from the train station , finally , finally , I know what I must do . But just as I take a step towards the sidewalk , preparing to run for it , Dimitri reaches out and grabs my wrist , his fingers tightening , like a handcuff , around my pulse . <p> Author Affiliation
