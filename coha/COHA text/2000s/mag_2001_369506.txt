In a cement-floored warehouse in upstate New York , half a dozen women sit hunched over computer workstations . Holding a heat gun in one hand and metal tweezers in the other , they pry silicon chips from circuit boards like dentists extracting little metal teeth . Down the hall , a jumble of bright green motherboards spills out onto a conveyor belt headed toward a shredder that will rip them to cracker-size pieces of plastic . And around the corner , a clean-cut guy in a black work smock takes a big hammer and smashes one hard drive after another before tossing them into a huge bin marked ALUMINUM . <P> No , this is not a PC factory gone berserk . This is the place where old computers go to die . IBM 's Asset Recovery Center in Endicott , N.Y. , is one of the largest PC junkyards in the world . Some 40 million lbs . of computers are dismantled here each year . <P> It hardly makes a dent , however , in the annual bumper crop of dead computers . Every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tossed into garbage cans , stashed in garages or forgotten in closets . Some 500 million PCs will be rendered obsolete by 2007 in the U.S. alone  --  abandoned by users who have upgraded to faster and sexier machines  --  according to a report by the National Safety Council . Computers are ranked as the nation 's fastest-growing category of solid waste by the Environmental Protection Agency . <P> And one of its most dangerous . Old PCs contain lead , cadmium , mercury and other unsavory components . Yet only 10% of the machines are recycled . Many of them find their way into landfills and incinerators , where they can threaten the environment . That 's why the European Union has drafted rules that will hold manufacturers responsible for recycling their wares by 2008 . <P> To fend off similar legislation here , U.S. manufacturers are scrambling to devise recycling programs of their own  --  and hoping to make a buck while they 're at it . Last November , IBM launched the first nationwide program ; it charges computer users a $30 shipping-and-handling fee to take even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch its consumer-PC take-back program in March . Regional efforts  --  such as Sony 's " recycling days " begun in Minnesota last fall  --  have sprung up from Oregon to New York . <P> They face some consumer resistance . It 's hard to pay a stranger to cart away a computer you bought for $2,000 . Yet by the time you 're ready to part with that machine , it 's often so obsolete that no school or charity will take it . If you put it on the curb with the trash , however , it will end up in a landfill , where toxins could leach into the soil . <P> A recycled PC , on the other hand , is literally a gold mine . Pentium and other processors have golden tips . A computer 's main circuit board , fashioned from copper and fiber glass , is studded with silver and gold connectors . A steel frame keeps the unit sturdy , and aluminum or copper heat sinks prevent the cpu from overheating . The outer plastic case can be recycled to make everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the back have rich copper wiring that can be reincarnated as pipes , pans or furniture .
