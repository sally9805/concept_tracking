<p> &lt;&gt; Does a rising tide lift all ships ? Two years after the movie 's extraordinary success , the stars and filmmakers talk about the blockbuster and how they coasted on to other projects . &lt;&gt; <p> Leonardo DiCaprio may have drowned in Titanic , but he is back on The Beach , a dark drama opening today . Kate Winslet may have found her true self in Titanic , but she is one lost soul in Holy Smoke , opening wide today . <p> And the Titanic 's ship may have sunk , but a big chunk of it is entertaining theme-park guests outside Sydney , Australia . <p> Like Celine Dion 's heart , the careers of those involved in Titanic will go on . Having the most monumental movie on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; could never be all bad . But on the other hand , nobody wants to be typecast as " Titanic 's Joe Schmo " for the rest of his life . <p> " When you have a film that enters the cultural iconography , there is a downside , " says James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamill is so associated with Star Wars that it was difficult for him to be seen as anything else but Luke Skywalker . Yet Harrison Ford was able to conquer that problem . <p> " So will Leonardo ; he wo n't be hurt by Titanic . But other actors are going to be so remembered for their part in Titanic that it 's going to be hard for them . I can understand if some actors do n't want to talk about Titanic anymore . " <p> But some will . It 's been two years since Titanic peaked at box offices around the world ( final take : $ 1.8 billion worldwide ; $ 600.7 million in North America ) . " Titanic is never going to be totally behind us , " says Jon Landau , who produced the film with Cameron and Rae Sanchini . " It became a phenomenon beyond anybody 's control . " <p> Turn to the next page for an update on where the ship 's passengers , captains and prominent props are today . &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Two years after the tumultuous sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new frontiers . But they have n't forgotten the biggest movie of the 1990s . USA TODAY 's Andy Seiler charts their movements since they were swept up in the ship 's cinema success . &lt;&gt; <p> &lt;&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio : Hero to heartthrob&lt;&gt; <p> Titanic accomplishment : Jack Dawson , the hero <p> Pre-cruise : Favored art-house films and indie projects such as What 's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Basketball Diaries . <p> Post-cruise : DiCaprio , 25 , became the heartthrob of millions of young women the moment Titanic landed in theaters . <p> He starred in minor mainstream hit The Man in the Iron Mask and collected kudos for seeming to spoof himself in a small role in Celebrity , a little-seen Woody Allen comedy . ( Both were filmed before Titanic 's release . ) <p> The actor did n't exactly jump on his wave of stardom , mulling several movies before settling on The Beach , in which he plays a rootless backpacker drawn to an island off the coast of Thailand and its commune lifestyle , which reveals a dark side . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark side so consciously , " DiCaprio says . " There are certain things that speak to me as an actor , that I find challenging , that 's all . It could be a comedic role or a romantic role or a psychopathic role or whatever . " ( Among roles DiCaprio considered was the very psychopathic title character in American Psycho . ) <p> What he took with him : DiCaprio says the most important thing he gained was power  --  he now has more control over and input in the movies he makes . " I want to be more closely involved in a film than ever before , whether it be the editing or trying to work on the script or character development , " he says . But he 's also now the highest-paid twentysomething actor in Hollywood . <p> Next : Martin Scorsese 's The Gangs of New York , in which he will play a 19th century gang leader 's son who vows to get revenge on the man who killed his father . He 's also interested in playing Anakin Skywalker in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas ' script . <p> Contributing : Claudia Puig <p> &lt;&gt;Kate Winslet : Ingenue to seductress&lt;&gt; <p> Titanic accomplishment : Young Rose , the heroine <p> Pre-cruise : Art-house hits such as Heavenly Creatures and Sense and Sensibility . <p> Post-cruise : Like DiCaprio , Winslet avoided big-star vehicles and went native , appearing in two exotic independent films  - -  Hideous Kinky , which came and went hideously quickly , and Holy Smoke , which is earning mixed reviews but acclaim for her steamy performance . ( Winslet , 24 , also married Kinky assistant director Jim Threapleton . ) <p> " Kate could have done any movie she wanted to coming out of Titanic , but she did n't race off and take a paycheck , " says Titanic producer Jon Landau . " She picked movies she responded to . And you 've got to admire that . " <p> What she took with her : She insists Titanic did not change her life in any way . " After I did the boat film  - -  and now I 'm only allowed to call it the boat film in my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God , your life is going to really change , ' " she told InStyle magazine . " But I made a decision that there were n't going to be any changes . I still go down to my local swimming pool and stand on the queue and pay like everybody else . " <p> Next : Quills , an erotic triangle from Douglas Wright 's Obie-winning play , due in the fall ; Winslet plays the maid of the Marquis de Sade ( Geoffrey Rush ) , who has been imprisoned in a Parisian insane asylum . And Therese Raquin , in which she plays a sensual woman who , along with her lover , murders her weak husband and is haunted by his ghost , based on the 1867 Emile Zola novel . It begins filming in London in late April . <p> &lt;&gt;Bill Paxton : In demand to even more in demand&lt;&gt; <p> Titanic accomplishment : Brock Lovett , the undersea explorer who searches the Titanic and ( on land ) finds old Rose <p> Pre-cruise : One of the busiest actors in Hollywood , Paxton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , True Lies , Apollo 13 and Twister . He even directed and starred in the classic ' 80s music video Fish Heads . <p> Post-cruise : Starred in the critically acclaimed A Simple Plan and Mighty Joe Young . <p> What he took with him : Opportunities , he says . " When you 're in a movie that big , just having your name associated with it means you 'll be considered for other projects . " <p> And a lesson : " Never bet against Jim Cameron when he puts his mind to something . I had to deal with so many naysayers telling me that Titanic was going to bankrupt the studios , that he could never make his money back . Hollywood is a weird , tough town . We build up the successful filmmakers , and we wait for them to fall , with our sharpened knives to cut them to pieces . " <p> Next : U-571 , a World War II submarine thriller from writer/director Jonathan Mostow ( Breakdown ) , is due in April . He now is shooting The Vertical Limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain in the world , scheduled for a July release . <p> &lt;&gt;Gloria Stuart : Homebody to hot ( again ) &lt;&gt; <p> Titanic accomplishment : Rose as an old woman <p> Pre-cruise : Stuart was a leading lady in the 1930s , appearing with everyone from James Cagney to Shirley Temple , but had largely retired by the end of the decade . <p> Post-cruise : Starred in The Love Letter . <p> What she took with her : A renewed career . " Because of Titanic , I re-entered the world of film , " says the 89-year-old Stuart . " I was going along making prints , working with my bonsai , having card games with my friends and traveling  --  and all of a sudden I 'm very busy going to film festivals . " <p> Titanic also inspired Stuart to write her autobiography , I Just Kept Hoping , but she was horrified when the media mostly focused on her brief discussion of masturbation . " It was so vomitous . It was one paragraph in a 350-page book . It still upsets me when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable movie My Mother the Spy , due in May , as Dyan Cannon 's mother . She is also in the upcoming Million Dollar Hotel with Mel Gibson . " I play a drunken , bad-mouthed bag lady off the street , " Stuart says . <p> &lt;&gt;James Cameron : Filmmaker to royalty&lt;&gt; <p> Titanic accomplishment : King of the world ( after the movie won 11 Oscars ) <p> Pre-cruise : Directed such hits as The Terminator , its sequel and True Lies . <p> Post-cruise : " I 've enjoyed the quiet in the wake of Titanic to cement my non-filmmaking life  --  which has been on hold for 18 years , " Cameron , 45 , says . <p> What he took with him : Even more confidence . " We were over budget , and we had made the first $ 200 million film , " he says . " We missed the July 4 release date and had to release it five months later . We were getting tons of bad press every single day . But as crazy and as hopeless as it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Next : He has been concentrating on engineering projects , such as a robot that could explore famous shipwrecks for a TV documentary . And he is working on ( but not directing ) a 2001 project depicting astronauts landing on Mars that would be a five-hour Fox miniseries and a 45-minute IMAX tie-in film . Another collaboration : Dark Angel , a sci-fi pilot for the Fox network . Though Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger will not be involved in a promised sequel to the Terminator films , they do hope to reunite with Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold for a True Lies sequel . <p> &lt;&gt;Celine Dion : Popular singer to superstar&lt;&gt; <p> Titanic accomplishment : Sang the theme song , My Heart Will Go On <p> Pre-cruise : Already a success , with a hit version of Beauty and the Beast ( with Peabo Bryson ) , The Power of the Dream ( the 1996 Summer Olympics theme song ) and Because You Loved Me ( theme song from the movie Up Close and Personal ) . <p> Post-cruise : The Canadian singer won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solo artist to sell more albums ( 110 million ) than any other . " I could feel the momentum building after the movie came out , but I was surprised that it got so big , " says Dion , 31 . " You have these dreams , but you never really think it can happen . " <p> What she took with her : More fame . " Titanic made my fame bigger , crazier , " she says . " It was wonderful , a fantasy . " <p> Next : The singer is taking the next few years off to enjoy life with her husband and manager , Rene Angelil , and her extended family ( she 's one of 14 children and has at least 40 nieces and nephews ) . <p> " I did n't want to take ( fame ) for granted and get a big ego , " she says . She wants to start a family of her own and plans to cook , have picnics and play golf . <p> Contributing : Edna Gundersen <p> &lt;&gt;Billy Zane : Cad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hockley , Rose 's villainous fianc&eacute; <p> Pre-cruise : Chilled audiences in the 1989 thriller Dead Calm and later played the virtuous hero of The Phantom <p> Post-cruise : Highest-profile role was Marc Antony in the ABC miniseries Cleopatra . <p> What he took with him : Flexibility , he says . " Titanic was a means to an end . The only question is a means to what end ? What do you want to do with it ? " <p> He ca n't imagine any minuses to being known for appearing in Titanic . " It 's a gift . " <p> Titanic also made him realize the global impact a film can have . During a three-day trek deep into the Sahara Desert for Cleopatra , a Bedouin tribesman removed his long hood and said to him : " Great movie ! " <p> " If it 's reaching the middle of the Sahara , and someone 's watching on some Russian bootleg tape , you 're clocking some air miles , " Zane , 33 , says . " The sphere of influence is really radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalization , the one film that 's been ridden around the globe with every possible means of distribution . " <p> On the other hand , thanks to network TV 's wide reach , more people saw Cleopatra in two nights than saw Titanic in two months , he notes . <p> Next : He stars in Sole Survivor , a four-hour Fox miniseries based on Dean Koontz 's suspense novel . No air date is set , though Zane is hoping for the May sweeps . He plays a former crime reporter , haunted by the plane crash that killed his wife and daughter , who discovers a deadly conspiracy . He also has started work on Uptown , a movie he plans to direct ( his first ) about a caseworker for the homeless and mentally ill who starts a theater project . <p> &lt;&gt;The ship : Movie marvel to theme-park attraction&lt;&gt; <p> Pre-cruise : Writer/director James Cameron and a massive team of artists , craftspeople and engineers built a nearly full-size , 775-foot-long exterior Titanic set . For interiors , they re-created the ship 's first-class dining salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court cafe , gymnasium and several staterooms . Cameron tried to broker a deal with a theme park or a Las Vegas casino to take the ship , but no one was interested . <p> Post-cruise : The ship set had to be disassembled to make way for movies such as In Dreams , Deep Blue Sea and The World Is Not Enough at the Baja California location . But elements survive . Many are in Australia . <p> " They 've opened a themed entertainment attraction at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney , " says Titanic producer Jon Landau , a consultant on the project . " We bring in groups of 80 to 100 people . They go through an experience of being an extra in the movie . They are brought into a holding area , a prop room that has quite a bit of the props in the movie , ranging from the safe that the diamond necklace was held in , to deck chairs , to china . " <p> Eventually , the theme music starts , curtains and gangplanks rise , and the participants enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rocks and shakes the ship when the " iceberg " hits . <p> " The attraction is totally immersive , " Landau says . " The boiler room is hot , and the North Atlantic is freezing . " <p> There are two props that Cameron held on to . " I kept the clock that was on the landing of the grand staircase , " he says . " And the ship 's wheel is in my office . It is a constant reminder of what it 's like to be the captain of a sinking ship  --  because that 's what it felt like when we were making the picture . It felt like we were all doomed . "
