<p> Journalists tell stories . Some of their best are about themselves and how they adapt - or do n't - to the societies in which they live . We asked Monitor foreign correspondents to share a few tales of their holidays abroad . The kings and I In November 1930 , says Latin American bureau chief Howard LaFranchi , the Mexican government became alarmed at the rising popularity of a red-suited , bearded foreigner at the Christmas season . It issued an edict : From then on , the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl would replace Santa Claus as the " divinity " bringing good things to girls and boys . The decree never took . " But in this age of globophobia and rants against cultural imperialism , I treasure the lesson Mexico has provided my family and me . While there is value in cultural diversity , it also takes cultural strength to accept - and at times adapt - the traditions of others , " says Howard . He admits , however , that the first year in Mexico , his young children adapted faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jan. 6 , the Epiphany , the revelation of the Christ to the three kings . In Mexico , these great gift bearers are responsible for filling children 's shoes left by the hearth . " But we did n't know what we were doing . We put oranges or a candy cane in them . " It might as well have been lumps of coal . Through their friends at school , Howard 's children were much better versed in Mexican traditions - and gift expectations . " We now keep one or two Christmas gifts back in reserve for when the tres reyes come , " he says . Howard 's family also now sings about " the fish in the river " who " return , return , return to drink " of the waters for having seen the birth of the baby Jesus - according to a favorite Christmas song here " we really do n't understand - and my wife , Jane , will even eat a tamale on Christmas Eve . " But LaFranchi 's favorite Mexican tradition is creating a nativity scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the local market . In addition to the holy family , the traveling kings and their desert tent , they now have a tortilla-making lady , a fisherman ( beside a pond with three fish ) , a snake , a frog , and two shocking pink flamingos , all there to adore the new king . Scrum at Manger Square Europe Bureau Chief Peter Ford recalls one Christmas during his posting to Jerusalem . He had managed to wangle much-coveted tickets to the Christmas Eve midnight mass at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . But when " I arrived with my visiting family , Manger Square was filled with a densely packed mob of would-be worshippers , being violently herded by Israeli soldiers , " he says . Peter , his brother , and his father ( all big men ) had to link arms and use their old rugby skills to form a protective wall in order to keep their 80-year-old grandmother from being flattened .

It 's their marriage anniversary . ( Note the choice of words . ) In Tokyo , Dec. 25 is an ordinary business day . Cameron and Nicole put on some " nice clothes " and had their landlady and Japanese language teacher witness their marriage papers . " We thought about a wedding with family and friends , but were defeated by the the logistics of getting people to Japan . We thought about eloping too , " says Cameron . Instead , they found themselves standing in the marriage , deaths , and births line Christmas morning at the Setagaya District Office in Tokyo . " We handed in our paperwork . And they checked our identities and our witnesses . We paid our $ 14 . " " Your marriage has been registered , " said the clerk . The two left for a honeymoon in Nagano , at a hot springs resort . They booked one night there , and enjoyed the spring-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No room at this inn . They found another , where they were visited by mountain monkeys while they luxuriated in sulfur baths . " No question , that was my best Christmas ever , " says Cameron . Multicultural feasting For Millenniums , breaking bread together has been a sign of making friends , says Tokyo bureau chief Ilene Prusher , " and I think that 's more evident at this time of year than at any other . I feel that my holiday celebration - now becoming a tradition - is defined by menu , and I 'm picking up more and more dishes as I move around the world . " Last year , Ilene and her roommate ( a fellow journalist ) had a holiday party in Jerusalem that included frying Hanukkah latkes ( Ilene 's mom 's recipe ) , making homemade Christmas ravioli ( an Italian-American delicacy , her roommate 's mom 's dish ) , and decorating a tree ( chopped down with a Palestinian friend somewhere in the forests surrounding Jerusalem ) , and making Ramadan pancakes . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem at a time when all three holidays fell in December , which does n't happen every year , " she says . " This year , I 'm in Tokyo and we 're making latkes , gingerbread cookies , and Ramadan cakes . We 'll have some sushi , too . And I have added to the menu Kwanzaa plantains and , most important , mochi , a sweet rice paste , which the Japanese eat on New Year 's . " A few more foreign postings , and I 'll have the whole UN on my table each December . " Queen on the telly In , Alexander MacLeod says one of the most durable Yuletide rites is Her Majesty the Queen 's Christmas Day broadcast . Alex , who is a New Zealander , and his Hungarian-born wife , push aside their duck a l'orange and join about 12 million British families who watch Queen Elizabeth at 3 p.m . " She 's been doing the broadcast every year since she ascended the throne in 1952 . Before that , starting in 1932 , her grandfather , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on radio and speak direct to British people every Christmas Day , " says Alex . These days , thanks to satellite links , the 10-minute talk goes out to 37 countries of the British Commonwealth - plus the United States , on a British Broadcasting Corporation channel . Truth be told , Alex says , the Queen " seldom says anything memorable , but the popularity of these broadcasts ca n't be denied . In the past few years , " Alex says , " people have had the option of switching to a commercial channel at exactly the same time and watching a comedian saying irreverent things about the monarchy . " No cocaine here The editors in Boston sent out Christmas stockings to the correspondents . But alas , Howard LaFranchi 's ran afoul of Mexico 's customs police . Howard was zipping off to conduct a last-minute interview earlier this week , while assuring his preschooler that , yes , they will go to see Jim Carrey in the " Grinch .

We will naturally deliver your gift , but for security reasons we must place it in a plastic specimen bag . " His son tugging on his pantleg and the clock ticking , Howard caves : " Whatever , sure . Do what you have to . " When the package arrives , Howard wastes no time in calling his editor . " Elisabetta , when you guys sent those chocolates in the stocking , was there paper wrapped around them ? " " Yes . " " Uh , yeah . Well , what I got was a Ziploc baggie and a pile of little brown pieces fused together . " Five minutes later , Howard calls again . " So , my little boy Gabriel saw the red and white striped candy in the bag and asked me for one of the candy canes ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , in case they were secretly hiding drugs !
