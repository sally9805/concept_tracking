<p> Pat Seh 's Centennial High School baseball hat sits cockeyed , one side of the bill yanked to his temple , the other side sitting precariously atop a bed of untamed curls . Somehow , the thing never falls off , which is no small wonder considering it stays on the head of a maestro  --  of new-school dugout chatter . <p> Should anyone need proof the days of " Sah-wing battah ! " died with the Betamax , here is Seh , a junior utility player , leading his teammates through a rousing chorus of " Peanut Butter Jelly Time "  --  a catchy little ditty that has become an Internet phenomenon featuring a singing , dancing , hip-hop inflected banana : <p> Seh : " Like a book " <p> Teammates : " Turn the page ! " <p> Seh : " Mash-po-tatoes " <p> Teammates : " And gravy ! " <p> Seh : " Mac-a-ronay " <p> Teammates : " And cheese ! " <p> Seh : " Pea-nut Butta ! " <p> Teammates : " And Jel-lay ! " <p> All together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter jelly time ! Peanut butter jelly time ! Peanut butter jelly time ! " <p> They sing " Peanut Butter Jelly Time " when the opposing pitcher makes a pickoff throw , a ploy to annoy him into ignoring their base runners . When one of their hitters draws a walk , they lower their voices and morph into a bunch of scraggly haired Sinatra impressionists . And they do n't sound too bad : <p> " Jee-pers , cree-pers , where 'd you get those peepers ? Jee-pers , cree-pers , where 'd you get those eyes ? " <p> Dugout chatter has existed in some form since the game 's birth . While many phrases , such as " Hit ' em where they ai n't , " have disappeared from the sport 's lexicon , the dialect 's most common expression  --  " Whaddya say , kid ? "  --  can still be heard on area diamonds . <p> But these days , fewer and fewer high school players talk it up from the dugout , and chatter has all but disappeared from the major leagues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centennial High something unique . <p> " They 're pretty smart kids and they do some clever cheers , " says Centennial Coach Denis Ahearn , whose team is 20-0 and ranked fifth in the area . " Other teams try to get loud , but I do n't think anybody is as creative as us . It 's something that we feed off . " <p> Whenever their opponents hold a conference on the mound , the Eagles clap and hoot incessantly . They stop abruptly when the meeting breaks up . <p> " Someone might actually throw at the next batter , so Ahearn told us to cool down on that just to protect our batters a little bit , " Seh says . <p> The chatter from Centennial 's dugout has its roots in classic baseball dugout jargon , much of which is unintelligible and throated in an intonation similar to the voices of newspaper hawkers in old movies . <p> " It 's almost a rabbinical or monk chanting , " says Paul Dickson , author of " The Dickson Baseball Dictionary , " a glossary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a rhythm . It 's a sort of way of communicating that transcends the words . " <p> There are two forms of dugout talk , according to Dickson : chatter and bench-jockeying . Regular chatter consists of hundreds of motivational phrases  --  such as " Hum now , kid " ( Come on ) , or " Let 's roll two " ( Let 's turn a double play ) . <p> Despite its name , however , chatter serves a purpose . <p> " Baseball , like any other endeavor , is run by energy . You actually gain energy by spending it , so there 's a lot of energy gained by chattering , " says Thomas Hanson , a Tampa sports psychology coach who has worked as a consultant for the New York Yankees , among other pro teams and athletes . <p> " When energy is flowing , " he says , " people play well . " <p> Bench-jockeying , meanwhile , is jawing at or mocking the other team , often directed at the pitcher . <p> " Oh man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose career in the majors has spanned 50 years . " You used to get on the other players out there on the field , and they 'd want to come over and fight you . " <p> According to Arundel Coach Bernie Walter , the National Federation of High Schools enacted a rule against bench-jockeying in the early 1990s . The verbal sparring had become a free-for-all . <p> " Before that , it was no holds barred . A lot of angry things were being said , " Walter says . <p> Chesapeake catcher Zach Moore is known as being somewhere between a chatterer and a jockey . He does n't speak directly to the opponent 's pitcher , but he does have a cache of one-liners he employs liberally . <p> " If he 's throwing high , " Moore says , " I 'll say , ' Get ' em a bucket ! ' " The jab , of course , being that the pitcher is throwing up . <p> When the pitches are missing low , Moore 's go-to quip is , to put it delicately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it down . " <p> " Talking just gets you going and gives you that mental advantage , and if you have the mental advantage you 're going to be successful 95 percent of the time , " says Moore , who is batting .430 . <p> Such quips are harmless , Chesapeake Coach Jim Simms says . <p> " I have never gotten upset about anything another team was saying . If you 've got rabbit ears , you ca n't be out here . If you 're concentrating on what the other team is saying , you 're not concentrating on the game , " he says . " I do n't think you can play the thing like you 're in church . " <p> St. John 's has earned a reputation not only as a perennial winner , but an often boisterous bunch . Cadets Coach Ed Gibbs admits he 's had some mouthy teams in the past , players who liked to talk to their opponents throughout the game . <p> " It started to get out of hand , so we pretty much clamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbs said . Still , he acknowledged it 's difficult to monitor every word that comes out of all 18 players ' mouths . " When you 're in a close game between rivals , " he said , " the dugouts are loud . " <p> According to Wilson Coach Eddie Saah , a nasty phrase was directed at Tigers pitcher Ian Horkley when the Tigers and Cadets played April 20 . <p> " They talked all game , " Saah said . <p> Gibbs said much of the chatter may sound inflammatory , but often it 's just jabs between friends . " There are all these traveling teams nowadays , " he said . " The thing you have to keep in mind is a lot of these kids know each other . " <p> Westfield Coach Chuck Welch says : " Old-school dugout talk was nasty . It was about riding the other team and picking up flaws  --  they might be heavy , or they might be skinny or something like that  --  and riding them . " <p> Centennial 's antics , meanwhile , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think its part of the game . It 's a baseball game , it 's not a circus , " Glenelg Coach Tom Thrasher says . <p> " It 's one thing to energize your guys , but a lot of that stuff seems like it 's designed to go against the opponent , " he says . <p> Ahearn defends his team 's chatter , saying it 's all part of the game . <p> " I grew up in New York and where I came from , what these guys do is tame , " he says . " There were very few umpires who would stop you from heckling the opposing pitcher . You could totally deflate him . But I do n't want my kids doing that . " <p> Walter , who has guided Arundel to a Maryland-record nine state titles , is a reformed chatterer . He now prefers relative quiet and less " false emotion . " Welch shares his sentiment . <p> " I want it when the game dictates it  --  when it 's the bottom of the seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , or something like that . I do n't want it to be constant , " he says . " I want you to be a student of the game . If you 're constantly running your mouth , your brain is using most of its capacity to talk . " <p> Robinson says chatter is a dying art in the major leagues . <p> " It 's just a thing that has happened with this generation of players . It just has disappeared . What happened to , when you 're out on the field defensively , the talk ? ' Hey , come on , come on , let 's go , hey , baby . ' Players look at you like , ' What ? ' It 's almost silent out there now , " he said . " The thing to me is that it kept you alert , a little bit more alert by chattering a little bit . " <p> Gaithersburg Coach Jason Woodward encourages chatter by requiring everyone but his pitcher and catcher to stand while the Trojans are batting . For Northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " talk it up " is like pulling teeth . <p> " I 've got to really get after my guys , " he says . " I do n't know if chatter is really even considered cool anymore . " <p> He obviously has n't seen a Centennial game .
