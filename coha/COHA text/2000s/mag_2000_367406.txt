Everybody hates an Anglophile . Or at least everybody should . By this I mean the kind of buttered-scone Anglophiles who have supported middlebrow imports like Ballykissangel and Masterpiece Theatre through pledge drive after pledge drive : those self-hating televisual Tories who cling to genteel dramas and dotty , dated comedies as a Union Jacked bulwark against American TV 's tendency to be so crude , so commercial ... so American . <P> This is no knock on our overseas cousins . Indeed , the people who should hate this type of Anglophile the most are the British . For with some exceptions ( Absolutely Fabulous , The Young Ones ) , the original British shows that Americans have most dearly embraced have reinforced a safe , neutered image of Britons , all Anglo veneer , no Saxon bile . ( Let 's not count the decades-old Monty Python and Fawlty Towers , which , however brilliant , are as representative of today 's Britain as a suet pudding . ) <P> Someone , however , is doing something to counter this starchy BBC stereotype  --  the BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded two years ago and now in about 12 million homes , the Beeb is recolonizing American tellies with a slate heavy on newer dramas and " Britcoms . " These raw , rude , thoroughly unpolite shows open a window on a brand new England , from the gritty Bosnian-war drama Peacekeepers to the Lynchian small-town comic horrors of The League of Gentlemen . <P> The motivation behind the channel is not cultural rehabilitation but the chance to grab a piece of the lucrative American market . The BBC has long sold reruns to the likes of PBS and licensed programs for adaptations ( All in the Family , for instance , was based on Till Death Us Do Part ) . " The BBC was very proud of its success on American TV , " says Paul Lee , BBC America 's chief operating officer . " But it had no equity stake . " So the broadcaster  --  a public entity in Britain  --  negotiated an alliance with Discovery Communications , parent of Discovery and other channels , which helped launch and market the new network . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven favorites . " People told me , ' The only things you can do are what you 've already made a success of , ' " Lee says . " Mysteries , classic dramas , maybe the more conservative sitcoms from PBS . " Instead BBC America opted to distinguish itself with shows " closer to the new Beetle than to the Jaguar : vibrant , contemporary , different . " While the network is not yet rated by Nielsen , it 's the edgier programming  --  running in blocks called Cool Britannia and the Britcom Zone  --  that has inspired a dedicated audience following and critical praise . But the channel also hedges its bets with BBC news and more traditional reruns like Dr. Who and , yes , Ballykissangel . " If you liked that kind of programming , now you can get a lot more of it , " says Judith A. McHale , president and chief operating officer of Discovery Communications . ( And the BBC will still sell shows to PBS and cable . ) <P> Given American producers ' continuing taste for adapting Brit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITV , not the BBC ) , you might think that watching BBC America is watching the future of domestic network television . But in the Pax Nike era of American cultural tyranny , is there still any difference between TV and telly ?
