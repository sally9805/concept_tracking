Introduction As I began this most horrifying of all books in my long career as a true-crime writer , I found myself faced with the same dilemma I encountered some twenty-five years ago . In the early 1970s , I worked as a volunteer at the Crisis Clinic in Seattle , Washington . Two nights a week , I worked an all-night shift with a young male psychology student at the University of Washington as my partner . Together we fielded calls from suicidal and distraught people . I had n't published a book yet , but by 1975 I had a contract to write one if the nameless killer of at least seven young coeds in Washington and Oregon was ever caught . As many readers know , that murderer turned out to be my partner : Ted Bundy . By the time I learned that , however , he had left the Northwest and continued his murderous rampage in Utah , Idaho , and Colorado . Convicted of attempted kidnapping in Utah , Ted was extradited to Colorado in 1976 to await his murder trials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two jails , making his way to Florida after his second - successful - escape on New Year 's Eve , 1977 . There he took the lives of three more young women and left another three for dead in Tallahassee and Jacksonville before he was finally arrested , convicted of murder in two trials , and sentenced to death . After nine years of appeals , Ted was electrocuted on January 24 , 1989 , at Raiford Prison . // How many women did Ted Bundy kill ? No one really knows for sure , but when Florida detectives told him that the F.B.I . believed his toll was thirty-six victims , he said , " Add one digit to that , and you 'll have it . " Only he knew if he meant 37 , 136 , or 360. // Throughout his years of imprisonment , Ted wrote dozens of letters to me , and sometimes made oblique statements that could be construed as partial confessions . // Initially , I tried to write the Ted Bundy saga as if I were only an observer , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been part of the story , so after two hundred pages , I started over on The Stranger Beside Me . There were times when I had to drop in and out of the scenario with memories and connections that seemed relevant . Stranger was my first book ; this is my twenty-third . Once again , I have found myself part of the story , more than I would choose to be in some instances . Many of the men and women who investigated these cases are longtime friends . I have taught seminars at law enforcement conferences with some of them and worked beside others on various task forces , although I am no longer a police officer . I have known them as human beings who faced an almost incomprehensible task and somehow stood up to it and , in the end , won . And I have known them when they were relaxed and having a good time at my house or theirs , setting aside for a short while the frustrations , disappointments , and tragedies with which they had to deal . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't ask questions that I knew they could n't answer . What I did learn I kept to myself until the time came when it could be revealed without negatively impacting the investigation . // So , the twenty-two-year quest to find , arrest , convict , and sentence the man who is , perhaps , the most prolific serial killer in history has been part of my life , too . It all began so close to where I lived and brought up my children . This time , I did n't know the killer , but he , apparently , knew me , read my books about true homicide cases , and was sometimes so close that I could have reached out and touched him . As it turned out , varying degrees of connection also existed between his victims and people close to me , but I would learn that only in retrospect . // There were moments over the years when I was convinced that this unknown personification of evil had to appear so normal , so bland , that he could have stood behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the restaurant booth next to mine . He did . And he had . // Looking back now , I wonder why I cut a particular article out of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . It was n't headline news , and it was so brief that it would have been easy to miss . By the summer of 1982 , I had moved on from covering six to eight homicide cases for True Detective and four other fact-detective magazines every month and was concentrating on writing books . I was under contract to do a novel at the time and I was n't even looking for true-crime cases to write about . But the short item in the " Local News " section was very sad : Two young boys had found the body of a young woman snagged on pilings under the Peck Bridge on Meeker Street in Kent , Washington . She had floated in the shallows of the Green River , her arms and legs entangled in a rope or some similar bonds . // The paper was n't specific about the cause of death , but police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been in the river for several days , no one had come forward to identify her . // The woman was white , estimated to be about twenty-five years old , and at five feet four , she weighed about 140 pounds . She had no identification on her body , and she wore unhemmed jeans , a lacetrimmed blue-and-white-striped blouse , and white leather tennis shoes . // Her clothing was n't distinctive , but King County medical examiner Dr. Don Reay noted that she had five tattoos on her body : a vine around a heart on her left arm , two tiny butterflies above her breasts , a cross with a vine around it on her shoulder , a Harley-Davidson motorcycle insignia on her back , and the unfinished outline of a unicorn on her lower abdomen . The delicacy of four of the tattoos warred with the motorcycle-gang mark , but Kent detectives still thought that it might be the likeliest lead they had in finding out who she was - if any members of local motorcycle organizations would admit to knowing her . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being careful to save the upper margin of the page with the date . It was published on July 18 , 1982 . She had actually been found on Thursday , July 15. // The victim had n't drowned ; she had been dead when she was placed in the river . When a description of her tattoos was published in area papers , a tattoo artist recognized his work and came forward to identify the victim . She was n't a grown woman at all ; she was much younger . He knew her as Wendy Lee Coffield . " I think she lives in Puyallup with her mother , " he added . " She 's only sixteen . " // Detectives located her mother , Virginia Coffield . Although she appeared to be in shock , the woman murmured , " I kind of expected it . " She explained that she suspected Wendy had been working as a prostitute and might have been attacked and killed by a " john . " // " I know that was the kind of life she chose for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We taught her the best we could . " // Wendy Lee 's mother said her daughter had been a good little gir when they were living in the country , but that her " trouble " had started when they moved to Auburn and Kent , both of which were still very small towns compared to Seattle and Tacoma. // Wendy and her mother never had much money as Virginia struggled to support the two of them after Virginia and her husband , Herb , divorced ; they lived in one low-rent apartment after another . There had even been times in the warm summer months when they had to live in a tent , picking blackberries to sell so they could buy food . // " Wendy dropped out of school - way back in junior high , " her mother said wearily . // She did n't say , but Wendy had been caught in an all too familiar vicious circle . Virginia herself was only thirty-six , worn and discouraged beyond her years . Her own childhood had been a miserable time where many of the adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the fuzzy escape of alcohol . She had come from " a big family of drinkers . " // Virginia had become pregnant at sixteen and given that child up for adoption . Then she spent two teenage years at Maple Lane , Washington 's juvenile corrections facility for girls . " I felt like I was a misfit ; nobody understood me . She Wendy was seeking help just like I did , but they put her out of juvenile detention when they should have given her supervision . She just needed a couple of years off the street to grow up . " // By mid-1982 , Virginia and Wendy were living in another rundown apartment in downtown Puyallup . Photographs of Wendy showed a smiling girl with a wide , open face . She could have passed for eighteen or nineteen , but she was only a few years past childhood . After she stopped going to junior high , she had been enrolled in Kent Continuation School in the hope that she could catch up . But she was a chronic runaway , perhaps wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or simply looking for excitement out in the world - or both . // Her mother had lost control of her . " Wendy just started having trouble , " Virginia Coffield said , explaining that her daughter was known to police for minor offenses in both King and Pierce Counties . " The last thing she did was she took $140 in food stamps from one of our neighbors. " // One night , when Wendy was fourteen or fifteen , Virginia recalled , she had come home disheveled and upset . " She said some guy raped her while she was hitchhiking . That 's the way she got around . Hitchhiking . I told her that 's what happens . " // Wendy changed after that and her problems grew . Her theft of the food stamps landed her in Remann Hall , the Pierce County juvenile detention center in Tacoma , and then into a foster home . She became a runaway from there on July 8 when she did n't return from a twenty-four-hour pass to visit her grandfather . // Wendy and her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have met the other 's expectations . Fathers drift away and single mothers despair of ever making enough money to keep going . Rebellious teenage daughters make it more difficult as they act out of their own pain . And so it continues . Wendy Lee got caught in the centrifugal force of it . She wanted the things she did n't have and she took terrible chances to get them . Somewhere along the way , she had met someone who was angry enough or perverted enough to consider her survival in the world insignificant . // Since Wendy 's body had been found within the Kent city limits , her murder would be investigated by the Kent Police Department . Chief Jay Skewes said that the last time anyone had seen Wendy alive was shortly after she had slipped out of Remann Hall , a week before her corpse was discovered in the Green River . She had been listed as a runaway , but no one had been actively looking for her . There were so many runaways that it was hard to know where to start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it really began . Her blurry photo appeared over and over in the media as the story of her murder was updated and details added . She was an attractive blond-haired girl , and I had written about hundreds of homicide cases in the dozen years before Wendy was killed , a number of them about pretty blondes who had been strangled . // But she was so young , and I learned she had been violently choked with her own panties . I had teenagers myself , and I remembered the girls I 'd known when I was in college and worked summers as a student intern at Hillcrest , the juvenile girls ' training center in Salem , Oregon ( a facility once known as a reform school ) . The Hillcrest residents ranged in age from thirteen to eighteen , and they tried to act tough , although I soon realized just how frightened and vulnerable most of them were . // Maybe that 's why I saved the clipping about the girl in the Green River . Or maybe it was because Wendy 's body had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of King County , Washington . At least a thousand times over the forty years I 've lived here , I 've passed the very spot where someone threw her away . // To reach this stretch of the Green River from my house , I had to cross Highway 99 and head about four miles down the long curving hill that is the Kent-Des Moines Road . The Green River coursed south from Eliott Bay and the Duwamish Waterway , irrigating the floor of the Kent Valley . In the days before the Boeing Airplane Company expanded and the Southcenter Mall mushroomed , the valley was known for its rich loamy soil and was home to family farms , many of which supplied produce to Seattle 's Public Market , or who simply put up their own stands along the road . When my children were small , I took them every summer to one of the U-Pick strawberry patches that abounded in the valley . We often took Sunday drives through Kent , Auburn , and Puyallup. // I had also driven along Frager Road on the Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nights , coming home from dinner with friends or from shopping at the Southcenter Mall . The lights of the huge mall faded within minutes as the road became indistinguishable from the river . // North of the Meeker Street Bridge , Frager Road and the rushing river frightened me a little at night because there were hardly any houses nearby , and winter rains made the Green River run so deep that it nudged the shoulders of the road . Drivers under the influence or inexperienced or reckless often missed turns on the narrow road and sailed into the river . Few of them survived . Sometimes they floated in the depths for a long time , because nobody was aware that their cars and bodies waited there beneath the surface . // In the moonless dark , the lonely road along the river seemed somehow sinister , although I could never come up with a good reason why I felt that way . It was just a river in the daytime , running past fields , tumbling-down farmhouses , and one tiny park that had two rickety picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little lean-tos made of scrap wood , angling for steelheads along the river . // Despite my foreboding , I often took Frager Road home after midnight because it was a shortcut to my house on S. 244th Street . When I came to S. 212th , I drove away from the river , turning right and then left up a hill , past the " Earth Works Park , " which was not really a park at all but a huge pile of dirt that had been bulldozed into oblique ascending levels and then thinly planted with grass . The City of Kent had commissioned it as an art project . It was n't pretty , it did n't seem like art and it , too , was faintly threatening as it loomed beside the secluded road that wound up a hill that became steeper and steeper . // I was always relieved when I reached the top and crossed Military Road onto S. 216th . Highway 99 - the SeaTac HiWay - where the lights were bright again , was only two blocks ahead and I was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frager Road between S. 212th and Meeker Streets , and Wendy 's body had drifted south of where I always turned off . In the summer months when she was found , the water was n't deep beneath the Meeker Street Bridge . //
