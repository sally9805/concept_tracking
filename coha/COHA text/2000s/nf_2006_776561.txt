The Stanley Works // Several years ago , Donald W. Davis stopped making visits back to New Britain , Connecticut . He felt shame for what had happened to the Stanley Works , the city ? s largest employer , which he had led from 1966 to 1988  --  from its best days to the beginning of the layoffs and plant closings that , after he was gone , finally reduced Stanley ? s presence in New Britain to a collection of mostly empty factory buildings and reproachful former workers . // Davis by then no longer lived in New Britain . He had sold his Dutch Colonial home , which he had painted a bright and optimistic yellow , and had moved with his wife to Martha ? s Vineyard , where their summer house on seven acres of rolling lawn became their main residence . It was an entirely different setting , but the trip back to New Britain for visits was easy enough  --  less than four hours by ferry and car  --  and Davis at first made it often . Like many chief executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the city that , in his day , had supplied thousands of Stanley ? s workers . He had served on the board of education for many years and was its president for a while . The six Davis children attended the public elementary schools . // But in the late 1990s , the visits home stopped . Meeting former Stanley employees on the streets , in restaurants , at the YMCA , where Davis still went to exercise , became too painful . " They just moaned about what was happening to this great company , " Davis told me . He had tried to share their sadness , to distinguish his stewardship from the accelerated pace of layoffs and the disregard for New Britain that had become so striking after he was gone  --  as if he were a victim too . But he wasn ? t really . The people he encountered had lost their jobs against their wishes , while he had retired on schedule , a wealthy man . And he had , after all , initiated the layoffs . No one blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley workers became , as Davis put it , " much too personal . " So he stayed away . // When we renewed our acquaintance a few years into his self-exile , I found a restless , often passionate man , unable to put behind him his final years as chief executive . At eighty-one , still stocky and agile , he was grateful for good health so late in life . Age showed only in his hair , which was pure white , and in his eyes , which became tired and bloodshot in the late afternoon , although when I suggested that we take a break in our conversation , which had started in the morning and had continued through lunch at a noisy seafood restaurant , he waved me off , intent on his recollections . He no longer bothered with the suits and sports jackets of his CEO days , but he did have on a white button-down shirt . He was running a leadership seminar twice a week during the fall semester at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where he shared a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled a class ; the seminar he led became a last connection to his former business world , a final public platform . Sitting in on a class in the late afternoon , listening to him draw on his experiences from his Stanley days , I imagined that beyond the nineteen young peo- ple seated in the room , he was speaking to all those he knew back home , explaining that he had done as well as any executive could , in a very changed world , to preserve Stanley as it was . And that could not be done . // The Stanley Works illustrates , as well as any Fortune 1000 company , the accelerating deterioration of job security in America over three gen-erations of chief executives , a deterioration that Davis and his counterparts in the first generation resisted for a while , reluctant to let go of the expiring norms . So did their workers . For almost ninety years , from the 1890s until the late 1970s , the thrust of American labor practices had been toward lasting attachments of employers to workers and vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Descriptions of labor practices during the 1921-22 recession , for example , are remarkably similar to labor practices today . But the direction was toward job security , not away from it . Efficiency seemed to require it . So did union power , government policies , community expectations , and social norms . Even the Depression , with its mass unemployment , produced in reaction labor laws that in the post-World War II years strengthened job security . We had decided as a people  --  managers , politicians , and workers  --  that job security had value , and in pursuit of that value , we lifted ourselves out of insecurity . And then , starting about 1977 , midway through Davis ? s twenty-one-year term as chief executive , there was a U-turn . // Over the next twenty years , the achieved job security disintegrated in the United States . Layoffs were the medium . Each step in the disintegration was a novelty and a shock . But the layoffs continued , and in 1984 the Bureau of Labor Statistics began to count " worker displacement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 million full-time workers who had been permanently separated from their jobs and their paychecks against their wishes . Huge as that number was , it did not include the millions more who had been forced into early retirement or had suffered some other form of disguised layoff , masking the magnitude of the problem . A more comprehensive survey would very probably have found that 7 or 8 percent of the nation ? s full-time workers had been laid off annually on average  --  nearly double the recognized layoff rate . And the percentages crept higher as the years passed . // Davis remembers vividly the circumstances that brought on the U-turn . The experience was , in his word , " traumatic . " He awoke in 1979 to find that customers for Stanley ? s hand tools were defecting in alarm- ing numbers . The lure was Asian tools . Once-shoddy socket wrenches , screwdrivers , claw hammers , saws , levels , chisels , pliers , and measuring tapes imported from Asia had gradually become indistinguishable in quality from Stanley ? s offerings , and at 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts in many other industries had not anticipated . // Scrambling to respond , they cut prices and , hoping to preserve profits , they began to cut labor costs , at first through attrition and then through layoffs . Hundreds of other companies were caught in a similar experience . From then on , job security unwound in America . Layoffs became the measure of our national retreat from the dignity that had been gradually bestowed on American workers over the previous ninety years . What started as a necessary response to the intrusion of foreign manufacturers into the American marketplace got out of hand . By the late 1990s , getting rid of workers had become normal practice , ingrained behavior , just as job security had been twenty-five years earlier . // That did not happen without resistance , particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s . Community groups , for example , tried to purchase and reopen shut factories , the goal being to reemploy the working people who gave the community its existence . The Roman Catholic Church joined in this endeavor , and issued two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the church fell silent , as did the communities , which disintegrated without the steady jobs that had sustained them . Government regulation had protected the jobs of nearly 13 percent of the workforce , those employed in airlines , trucking , public utilities , telephones , banking , and railroads . And then deregulation , starting with President Jimmy Carter , precipitated endless reorganizations in those industries , and endless layoffs to accommodate the reorganizations , until reorganization and layoff finally became the norm . Organized labor also protested , but union membership and power were already in decline , and after 1981 , when President Ronald Reagan fired and then replaced the nation ? s striking air traffic controllers , strike activity in support of job security  --  or in support of any other demand , for that matter  --  declined precipitously . The old assumption that a worker out on strike had his job waiting once the strike ended was gone . // Just as layoffs began to be a source of national anxiety , mainstream economic theory completed an about-face that in effect endorsed layoffs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Con- gress to preserve job security . The dethroned way of thinking had recognized a central role for government in protecting workers in a free market economy . Entrepreneurial , hard-driving managers were essential to keep the economy vibrant and growing . But they ran roughshod over workers unless they were restrained by government rules and regulations , including rules that strengthened labor ? s bargaining power . The marketplace would not provide job security without pressure from government . That way of thinking , born in the New Deal in the 1930s and greatly expanded over the next three decades , died in the 1970s. // The new intellectual framework took the opposite view , and in so doing validated what was already beginning to happen . Companies were freeing themselves from the many obligations to their employees that had accumulated over the years , and now mainstream economics blessed that endeavor . In the process , government was depicted as an obstacle to prosperity . Unfettered enterprises , the argument now went , would expand more rapidly and , over the long run , share their rising profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raises . If that did not happen  --  and it did not happen for tens of millions of people who lost their jobs  --  well , that was the fault of the job losers themselves . They had failed to acquire the necessary skills and education to qualify for the increasingly sophisticated jobs that were available . They lacked value as workers . And the argument took hold . Sanford M. Jacoby , the economic historian , citing a study typical of this period , noted that " workers with at least some college education were more likely than less educated workers to view fairness as ? recognition of individual abilities ? instead of ? equal treatment for all. ? " // The new economic theory , making each worker responsible for his or her own job security , interacted fatally with the actual layoff experience . Layoffs , we are told , do not happen to people who are valued by their employers . The layoff says that you have failed in your endeavors to improve your skills and to be flexible , innovative , congenial , and hardworking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shows up frequently in people who have been laid off , whether or not they work again , and yet it is ignored in the political debate . Job creation and full employment are held up by Democrats and Republicans , and nearly all the experts who advise them on policy , as sufficient antidote . Putting the laid-off back to work in new jobs solves the problem . There is income again and even prosperity , or the potential for it . But mental health is not easily restored . // Psychologists and psychiatrists are just beginning to recognize that layoffs chip away at human capital by eating at self-esteem on a mass scale . It is like acid rain eroding the environment , according to Dr. Theodore J. Jacobs , a professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and New York University School of Medicine in New York . He says : " Even if a person is accurate in saying , ? I did a really good job , and I can see that the company is in a bad way and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really not about me , ? there is seldom an escape from the inner sense of ? Why me ? ? In other words , one has some sense that one has failed and the outside world has made that judgment . And that self-perception dovetails with existing inadequacies that many people feel about themselves . " // The Great Depression was less damaging . Millions of people lost their jobs then , but the majority blamed flaws in the market system , not in themselves . They demanded that government fix the flaws . That collective response , which helped to produce the New Deal , is missing today . Implicit in self-blame is acquiescence to layoffs , now the American condition . // All this was still well in the future when Don Davis became chief executive of the Stanley Works in 1968 . Job insecurity in those days  --  at the Stanley Works and most other manufacturers  --  went no further than the temporary furloughing of blue-collar workers when sales weakened . The white-collar staff  --  clerks , secretaries , salespeople  --  were not touched . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But at the factory level , some workers would be told to stay home until production picked up again , which it always did in those truly prosperous years . Seniority dictated who was furloughed first , and in what order they would be recalled , which they always were . " That was a very important thing , that recall ; it made people feel they still had this connection with Stanley , " Davis said . Seniority rights continued to accrue during the stay-at-home period , and health insurance remained in effect . These were Stanley ? s ways , and the ways of many American companies . // The onslaught of imports starting in the late 1970s changed those ways . As customers defected , sales plummeted and failed to bounce back . Nowhere was that more on display than in the auto industry ? s struggle with Japanese imports . But nearly every manufacturer was hit , and the steep recession in 1981 and 1982 compounded the damage . The old world has never returned . Visit the tools department at Home Depot , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of its annual output in 2004 , and the array of products shows Stanley painfully struggling to stand out . The company ? s yellow and black colors still dominate the shelves where measuring tapes are stacked , the clip-to-the-belt models whose steel blades spool out across a room and quickly retract into stubby cassettes at the click of a lever . Many of the claw hammers bear Stanley ? s name , and also the scraper blades , the linoleum-cutting knives , and every variety of saw  --  hacksaws , wood saws , keyhole saws , compass saws , pull saws . But even on these shelves , the colorful tools of other companies are well represented . And the Stanley label no longer dominates the displays of socket wrenches , screwdrivers , adjustable squeeze-handle pliers , levels , wood planes , counter punches , chisels , and bolt cutters . //
