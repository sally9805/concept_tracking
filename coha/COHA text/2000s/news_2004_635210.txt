<p> Most crime movies begin in the present and move forward , but film noir coils back into the past . The noir hero is doomed before the story begins  --  by fate , rotten luck , or his own flawed character . Crime movies sometimes show good men who go bad . The noir hero is never good , just kidding himself , living in ignorance of his dark side until events demonstrate it to him . <p> " Out of the Past " ( 1947 ) is one of the greatest of all film noirs , the story of a man who tries to break with his past and his weakness and start over again in a town , with a new job and a new girl . The movie stars Robert Mitchum , whose weary eyes and laconic voice , whose very presence as a violent man wrapped in indifference , made him an archetypal noir actor . The story opens before we 've even seen him , as trouble comes to town looking for him . A man from his past has seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulls him back . <p> Mitchum plays Jeff Bailey , whose name was Jeff Markham when he was working as a private eye out of New York . In those days he was hired by a gangster named Whit Sterling ( Kirk Douglas , electrifying in an early role ) to track down a woman named Kathie Moffat ( Jane Greer , irresistibly mixing sexiness and treachery ) . Kathie shot Sterling four times , hitting him once , and supposedly left with $40,000 of his money . Sterling wants Jeff to bring her back . It 's not , he says , that he wants revenge : " I just want her back . When you see her , you 'll understand better . " <p> That whole story , and a lot more , is told in a flashback . When we meet Jeff at the beginning of the film , it 's in an idyllic setting by a lake in the Sierras , where he has his arm around the woman he loves , Ann ( Virginia Huston ) . He bends over to kiss her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deaf and mute kid who works for him at the station . Jimmy uses sign language to say a stranger is at the station , asking for him . This man is Sterling 's hired gun , named Joe Stephanos ( Paul Valentine ) , and he tells Jeff that Sterling wants to see him in his lodge on Lake Tahoe . <p> Jeff takes Ann along on the all-night drive to Tahoe , using the trip to tell her his story  --  his real name , his real past , how he tracked Kathie Moffat to Mexico and fell in love with her . ( " And then I saw her , coming out of the sun , and I knew why Whit did n't care about that 40 grand . " ) He tells Ann more , too : How he lied to Sterling about finding Kathie , how he and Kathie slipped away to San Francisco and thought they could live free of the past , how they were spotted by Fisher ( Steve Brodie ) , Jeff 's former partner . Fisher followed them to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff behind with the body and a bank book revealing she indeed had stolen the $40,000 . <p> The story takes Jeff all night to tell , and lasts 40 minutes into the film . Then we 're back in the present again , at the gates of Sterling 's lodge . Ann drives away and Jeff walks up the drive to square with his past . In the lodge , not really to his surprise , he finds that Kathie is once again with Sterling . This Sterling is a piece of work . Not only has he taken Kathie back after she shot him , he wants to hire Jeff again after he betrayed him . This time he needs him to deal with Leonard Eels , an accountant in San Francisco who keeps Sterling 's books , and is blackmailing him with threats involving the IRS . <p> The meeting between Mitchum and Douglas opens on a note of humor so quiet , it may pass unnoticed . " Cigarette ? " offers Douglas . " Smoking , " said Mitchum , holding up his hand with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck me as odd , as somehow outside the movie , and I asked Mitchum about it after a screening of " Out of the Past " at the Virginia Film Festival . <p> " Did you guys have any idea of doing a running gag involving cigarette smoking ? " I asked him . <p> " No , no . " <p> " Because there 's more cigarette smoking in this movie than in any other movie I 've ever seen . " <p> " We never thought about it . We just smoked . And I 'm not impressed by that because I do n't , honest to God , know that I 've ever actually seen the film . " <p> " You 've never seen it ? " <p> " I 'm sure I have , but it 's been so long that I do n't know . " <p> That was Mitchum for you , a superb actor who affected a weary indifference to his work . <p> There is a lot of smoking in " Out of the Past . " There is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it goes with the territory . Good health , for noir characters , starts with not getting killed . But few movies use smoking as well as this one ; in their scenes together , it would be fair to say that Mitchum and Douglas smoke at each other , in a sublimated form of fencing . The director is Jacques Tourneur , a master of dark drama at RKO , also famous for " Cat People " ( 1942 ) and " I Married a Zombie " ( 1943 ) . He is working here for the third time with the cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca , a master of shadow but also of light , and Musuraca throws light into the empty space between the two actors , so that when they exhale , the smoke is visible as bright white clouds . <p> Mitchum and Douglas think the story involves a contest of wills between them , when in fact , they 're both the instruments of corrupt women . Kathie betrays both men more than once , and there is also Meta Carson ( Rhonda Fleming ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's fascinating is the way Jeff , the Mitchum character , goes ahead , despite knowing what 's being done to him . How he gets involved once again with Sterling and Kathie , despite all their history together , and how he agrees when Meta suggests a meeting with Eels , even though he knows and even says " I think I 'm in a frame , " and points out that he 's been given a drink so that his prints will be on the glass . <p> The scenes in San Francisco , involving the murder of Eels , the whereabouts of the tax records and the double-dealing of Meta Carson , are so labyrinthine , it 's remarkable even the characters can figure out who is being double-crossed , and why . The details do n't matter . What matters is the way that Jeff , a street-wise tough guy , gets involved in the face of all common sense , senses a trap , thinks he can walk through it , and is still fascinated by Kathie Moffat . <p> He first reveals his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the 40 grand . <p> " But I did n't take anything . I did n't , Jeff . Do n't you believe me ? " <p> " Baby , I do n't care . " <p> And later , although he tells her , " You 're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another , " he is attracted to her , lured as men sometimes are to what they know is wrong and dangerous . <p> Film noir is known for its wise-guy dialogue , but the screenplay for " Out of the Past " reads like an anthology of one-liners . It was based on the 1946 novel Build My Gallows High by " Geoffrey Homes , " a pseudonym for the blacklisted Daniel Mainwaring , and the screenplay credit goes to Mainwaring , reportedly with extra dialogue by James M. Cain . <p> But the critic Jeff Schwager read all versions of the screenplay for a 1990 Film Comment article , and writes me : " Mainwaring 's script was not very good , and in one draft featured awful voice-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total rewrite and even worse ; it was totally discarded . The great dialogue was actually the work of Frank Fenton , a B-movie writer whose best known credit was John Ford 's ' Wings of Eagles . ' " <p> Listen to the contempt with which Sterling silences his hired gun , Stephanos : " Smoke a cigarette , Joe . " And " Think of a number , Joe . " Listen to Joe tell Jeff how he found his gas station : " It 's a small world . " Jeff : " Yeah . Or a big sign . " Kathie saying " I hate him . I 'm sorry he did n't die . " Jeff : " Give him time . " Jeff 's friend the cab driver , assigned to tail Meta Carson : " I lost her . " Jeff : " She 's worth losing . " Jeff to Kathie : " Just get out , will you ? I have to sleep in this room . " Kathie to Jeff : " You 're no good , and neither am I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movie 's most famous exchange , Kathie telling him , " I do n't want to die . " Jeff : " Neither do I , baby , but if I have to , I 'm going to die last . " <p> The movie 's final scene , between the hometown girl Ann and Jimmy , Jeff 's hired kid at the gas station , reflects the moral murkiness of the film with its quiet ambiguity . I wo n't reveal the details , but as Jimmy answers Ann 's question , is he telling her what he believes , what he thinks she wants to believe , or what he thinks it will be best for her to believe ? <p> " Out of the Past " is a new July 2004 DVD release , with expert commentary by film noir guru James Ursini.
