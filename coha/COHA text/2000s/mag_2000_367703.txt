Twain placed Huck and Jim on the river because the river was time , motion , beauty , baptism and violence , but mainly because one could not see around the bend . Civilizations are formed by bends in the river  --  the Nile , Congo , Thames , Yangtze  --  a twist of the land , water and fate that , by making it impossible to see what comes next , raises hopes of the possibility of everything . <P> The Mississippi did that from the start . In the spring and summer of 1768 , Montfort Browne , Lieutenant Governor of Florida , made his way along the lower Mississippi to the area of " the Natches , " where he found " the most charming prospects in the world . " By the mid-1770s , colonial explorers were following rivers everywhere into the country . They came from central and western New York by way of the Ohio ; from Maryland and Virginia by way of the Tennessee ; from western North Carolina through gaps and passes in the Appalachians to the Tennessee and Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> America was created by people riding its rivers  --  the most fruitful , profitable places to settle lying just around the bend . The country itself was a bend in the river , a story about to be disclosed , a promise of progress  --  that , of course , and a murder plot . Following rivers with Indian names , the latest Americans could kill off the first . For better and worse , the Old World married the New by a band of water . <P> No wonder so many American artists have written , sung , painted and even gone round the bend , gone mad , in the name of rivers . In his overboard essay on Huck and Jim , Leslie Fiedler wrote that the river supports " the American dream of isolation afloat . " Out of that isolation in motion comes every inspiration , from contemplation ( Langston Hughes ' " The Negro Speaks of Rivers " ) to adventure ( Hemingway 's stories ) to despair . The poet John Berryman looked down into the Mississippi and jumped to his death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Huck finds a loving relationship with Jim , but he is alone in his moral predicament . The American rivers show us a country equally capable of generosity and advancement , and of drowning in freedom .
