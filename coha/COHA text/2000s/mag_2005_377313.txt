Ning Wen and his wife were arrested last fall at their home office in Manitowoc , Wis. , for allegedly sending their native China $500,000 worth of computer parts that could enhance missile systems . As these naturalized citizens await trial , similar episodes in Mount Pleasant , N.J. , and Palo Alto , Calif. , point only to the tip of the iceberg , according to FBI officials keeping tabs on more than 3,000 companies in the U.S. suspected of collecting information for China . A hotbed of activity is Silicon Valley , where the number of Chinese espionage cases handled by the bureau increases 20% to 30% annually .

To help sort the few who go to America to spy from the thousands who go there for a better life , the FBI relies heavily on Chinese informants . Says a high-ranking Silicon Valley agent : " We have almost more assets than we can deal with . "  --  By Brian Bennett . With reporting by Timothy J.
