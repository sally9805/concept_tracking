Journal of Mlle. Zoe Cyprienne Lane <br> Presented to Me Upon the Occasion of My Thirteenth Birthday <br> Myers Cottage , Darkfrith <br> York , England <br> May 1 , 1766 <br> No rain . <br> Cherry Cake with Breakfast . Spotted Scones and Cider after <br> Supper . <br> From Mother : The Journal . An Embroidered Tucker . <br> From Uncle Anton : A Tome of Verse : Songs for Gentle Girls . <br> From Cerise : An Ink and colored Portrait of my favorite rooster , Maximillian . ( From me to Cerise : A Polished Silver Nugget in the Shape of a Heart from the River Fier . ) <br> From Lord Rhys Sean Valentin Langford , second son of the Alpha ( ! ) : A bouquet of Pure Whyte Roses ( the marchioness 's garden ? ) . A Small Carving of Maximillian from Pine ( bloodstain on the left wing ? dirt ? ) . A Woven Ring of his Hair ( ! ! ) . <br> Roses to Mother . Hair Ring to the dust bin . I rather like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> No rain . Quite hot . <br> Lessons to-day in the village from the Dreaded Council for All Drakon Children . ( I do think that at Thirteen Years of Age One ought not to be called a Child , and ought to be excused from these events , but the Council Begs to Differ . ) I do n't know why they bother repeating the same shabby old rules year after year . We 've heard them enough by now to choke on them : We must not Leave the Shire ! We must not Speak of the Gifts ! We must not Reveal our Secrets to the Others ! We must Think Only of the Tribe ! <br> Rhys arrived late , as ever ( no one even chided him . I suppose it must be lovely to be a Lord ) , and insisted upon squeezing into the seat next to mine . Then he kept pretending to tip his Inkpot upon my skirts when None were Looking . Vexing . I do n't care what he said afterward , I do n't believe he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concede , however , that it was unfortunate the Ink spilled upon his breeches instead . <br> Cerise claims She Saw it All . Grew very red and said that I was a shameless flirt . I told her to find a looking glass before casting names at me . Everyone knows she 's a Goose , no matter that she 's the elder by three minutes . <br> I can not fathom a person less Likely to be my Twin . <br> Perhaps she is a changeling . <br> Journal <br> June 19 , 1766 <br> No rain . <br> Full moon , could n't sleep . Mother made me extinguish the lamps early . The smell of smoking oil simply fills my face ; I can hardly breathe with it . When I opened my window the stars tried to siphon me up into the sky . Saw Uncle Anton flying , the marquess , Mr. Williams , Mr. Grady , at least five more . We are so very lovely by moonlight . I do hope-I do I DO HOPE I shall fly too someday . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marchioness , but I could be the first . I want it so much . <br> I shall be pink and gold and silver . Those are my favorite colors . I shall have a mane of glorious silk . <br> Rhys boasted he can already Turn . Liar . Lord Rhys of the manor house surviving his first Turn ? I certainly would have heard about that . <br> June 21 , 1766 <br> Cloudy . <br> With Rhys in the woods . Should not have gone there with him , but he said he would prove he could Turn . And he did . <br> Thirteen is young . I suppose he 's a half year older than that but most in the Tribe Turn after they are sixteen at least . I have time yet before I need worry . <br> His eyes are very green . I wonder that I never noted it before . <br> June 24 , 1766 <br> Still Cloudy . No rain . <br> Rhys says the most foolish things . My hair is like Ivory . My voice is like Dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed . I told him that comparing my eyes to the color of tar was uncouth . <br> He changed it to Obsidian and Tried to Kiss me again . I did not Let him . <br> June 25 , 1766 <br> Wind Rising . Clouds Darkening . <br> He keeps trying to get me to Go Back to the Woods with him . I know it 's a Terrible Notion . But I want to . He tracked me to-day to the Lending Library , which very much needs to have its windows wiped . It was murky and we- <br> I do not know why I feel these things around him , my stomach upset and my heart pounding all queer . It 's quite unpleasant , actually . <br> He 's Graced me with a Pet name . No one 's ever done such a thing before . " ZEE . " As if my given name is too difficult to manage , all two syllables of it . <br> Zee . <br> His smile is so fetching . He never bothers with a hat or gloves so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go with him to the Woods . <br> Cerise more and more waspish every day . She has at least Five beaux . I ca n't imagine why she would begrudge my One . <br> June 26 , 1766 <br> Storm to the East . Not here Yet . <br> I had a Dream Last Night that he came to my window as a dragon , dark glimmer and gold . I dreamt the dragon was tap-tapping on the glass , like raindrops , steady and soft , but when I woke , he was not there . Only those storm clouds , and not a drop of rain . <br> The air feels so heavy I could tear at my hair . <br> Addendum <br> HE LOVES ME . <br> ! ! ! ! ! ! <br> He wrote it on a slip of paper during Council Lessons . Pressed it into my hand as we were Leaving , along with a rose petal he had hidden in a pocket . <br> Lord Rhys Langford of Chasen Manor Loves ME , of all the maidens of the shire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who once put a clot of mud in his tea when he would n't stop teasing me about besting him in Latin and Arithmetic . Me , and I 'm not even Pretty . Cerise says my eyes are too strange and my lips are too big and I 'll certainly never Develop as she has . <br> Me . <br> What a load of piffle . All that just to steal a kiss in the woods . It 's really rather pitiful , is n't it ? <br> ( I shall save the petal here , between these pages . ) <br> Addendum Addendum <br> Cerise found the paper . I had dropped it by accident in the Hallway after Supper , and came upon her just as she was picking it up . I could hardly disguise from Whom it Came . Master Baird says Rhys 's penmanship flows like a Sultan 's robes in the wind , right off the edges of the page . Most Distinctive . <br> She was red again , even more red than her hair . She was trembling . I stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . <br> Cerise is in love with Rhys . Enormously shocking ! <br> But she is . She 's weeping in her room right now . I can hear her through the wall , though she 's trying to be quiet . <br> August 1 , 1766 <br> I 've thought on it a great deal . I 've thought and thought . <br> Cerise and I have been at odds nearly our entire Lives . She is Comely while I am not ; she is well liked while I am not . She is fashionable , and droll , and buxom , while I am . . . not . It 's a very great Wonder that we should have shared a womb at all . But I look at the portrait of Maximillian she made for our birthday , now hung above my bed . I look at the lines very carefully drawn , and how steady her hand was with the colors . How she got every stripe in his feathers just right , and the red comb , and the cock of his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete it , especially since Maximillian despises Cerise and must have spent a great deal of his portrait time hiding behind the coop . <br> She is my Twin . When she weeps I feel it to my bones . <br> August 2 , 1766 <br> Cloudy . Warm . <br> I told Rhys to leave me be . I told him I did not love him . I gave him back his carving of Maximillian , just so he knew I was Sincere . <br> August 4 , 1766 <br> Cloudy . Hot . <br> He persists . <br> August 19 , 1766 <br> Cloudy . Hot , hot , when will it rain ? <br> He leaves gifts for me on my sill . He follows me about . When I walk to the village , he is there . When I walk to the downs , he is there . When I feed the chickens , he is there , and it is a Very Big Fuss because now that he can Turn , all the animals scatter in fear of their Lives . Mother Heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hens wo n't settle if he 's near ; they remain frightened for days . No eggs . <br> I hardly think it 's fair I was punished for that . I 'm trying to get rid of him . <br> September 1 , 1766 <br> I had the same Dream last night . Rain was softly falling , and he came to my window , tapping on the glass . Only this time when I awoke , it was so hot I was perspiring , and the rain was really , truly falling , drawing into silvery tears down the panes . <br> And behind the tears was the dragon , watching me with glowing green eyes . <br> No Dream . <br> I walked to the window and looked back at him . His scales were slick and shining , an emerald so dark it was nearly black , and his talons and mane and wings were metallic gold . He looked from me to the brink of the eastern forest over his shoulder , then back at me . I understood him as clearly as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come to the woods . <br> Instead , I pulled the shutters across the window , latched them , and returned to bed . <br> December 24 , 1769 <br> Snowing ! <br> It 's wonderful to have everyone around in one house , even if it is for just a few days . I love the scents of the holidays , cinnamon and roast goose and pine needles covered in ice . Mother 's cough has improved . Even Cerise laughed at the runny mess I made of the plum pudding . <br> Saw Lord Rhys back from Eton today in the village , shopping , I think . He was there with all three sisters and his brother , and their father . The Marquess of Langford tipped his hat to me and wished me a very Happy Christmas . I , of course , wished them all the same . <br> February 2 , 1773 <br> Cold and Sunny . <br> I can not fully describe my emotions on this day . I 'm very happy for Cerise , of course . She deserves every Felicitation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . Thomas is no doubt a good man , a strong dragon , and their child will be doubly blessed . <br> I ca n't imagine having a baby . I ca n't imagine being wed . I think of Love and feel only a rather empty sense of curiosity . I 've been kissed before , and I liked it . I 've been squired before-to dances , to soirees-and I liked that too . But I feel so strange these days . I look up at the sky and I feel as if I have forgotten something important . <br> Not the Turn . I suppose I never really believed that would happen . Yet when the clouds gather and blow , it almost seems like they 're taking a part of me with them . I long for the rain , all the time , and I do n't know why . <br> Hayden James came by today for tea bearing a posy for me and a bouquet for Mother 's sickroom . He 's blond and tall and quite handsome . But he spent an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was bored . <br> May 11 , 1774 <br> Temperate . Clear . <br> I should have anticipated this . I mean , I did anticipate it . I just never truly believed he would work up the nerve to ask . <br> Hayden is very dear . I do like him . Perhaps I even love him . I enjoy his quiet company , and his thoughtfulness , and the way his eyes light up to the most perfect blue when he smiles . I appreciate that he still brings lilacs to Mother 's grave , and that he worries about me living alone here in the cottage . It 's very kind , if unnecessary . I have my work ( although I am a poor substitute for Mother 's skills ) , and family about . I have ones who care . We are a tribe , after all , and no one is ever truly alone in Darkfrith . Just ask the Council . <br> I suppose that if I am to note that Hayden 's character is rather reserved , I must also truthfully declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If his demonstrations of physical affection for me are somewhat . . . restrained , at least I know he values my virtue . <br> I 've tried to close my eyes and picture him in the cottage with me , taking tea with me every day for the rest of our lives . Our sons and daughters around us , yellow-haired and merry . What a relief it would be to finally slip into the domestic ease enjoyed by the rest of the tribe . <br> Madam Zoe James . Madame Zoe James . <br> He is a fine man . I must think about how to answer him . My least desire is to hurt him . <br> May 12 , 1774 <br> Rhys . Langford . Is . An . Ass . <br> Saw him at Market this morning in the village . Heavens knows what he was doing at Market , since he surely never has to purchase anything of his own . There are servants to shop for him , after all . No doubt he 's just been sent down from Cambridge ( again ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a change . <br> ( What would I give for a chance to leave this shire and attend school ! You can bloody well wager I 'd not get caught doing anything to send me back here , but of course only the hallowed family of the Alpha is allowed to leave ! ) <br> He spies me before the bakeshop buying bread and saunters over . Yes . Saunters . He wears his hat cocked back and his brown hair untied and his breeches too tight and has this smile , this so Charming and Sweet smile , as if he 's just happened upon a Dear Bosom Friend . Which I am not . <br> " I understand I am to congratulate you , " he says . <br> " Oh ? " I reply , because I ca n't imagine to what he 's referring . Cerise 's second child ? Surely not Hayden , as I have not yet spoken with him . <br> " Indeed , " he says . " Hayden James , eh ? Decent sort , if a bit dull . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the courage to end your reign as the Old Maid of the Shire . " <br> I did not throw my bread at him . I merely gave him my coolest smile and answered , " As long as it was n't you . Oh , but that 's right-you did try , did n't you ? " <br> And then I sauntered away . <br> Continues ...
