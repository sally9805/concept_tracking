chapter I // First Visions // ( from Newport to Des Moines ) // A People and Its Flag // It was here , not too far south of Boston , on the East Coast , which still bears the mark of Europe so clearly , that Alexis de Tocqueville came ashore : Newport , Rhode Island . This well-kept Easton ? s Beach . These yachts . These Palladian mansions and painted wooden houses that remind me of the beach towns of Normandy . A naval museum . An athenaeum library . Bed-and-breakfasts with a picture of the owner displayed instead of a sign . Gorgeous trees . Tennis courts . A Georgian-style synagogue , exhibited as the oldest in the United States : with its well-polished pale wood , its fluted columns , its spotless black rattan chairs , its large candelabra , its plaque engraved with clear-cut letters in memory of Isaac Touro and the six or seven great spiritual leaders who succeeded him , its American flag standing next to the Torah scroll under glass , it seems to me , on the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flags : a riot of American flags , at crossroads , on building fronts , on car hoods , on pay phones , on the furniture displayed in the windows along Thames Street , on the boats tied to the dock and on the moorings with no boats , on beach umbrellas , on parasols , on bicycle saddlebags  --  everywhere , in every form , flapping in the wind or on stickers , an epidemic of flags that has spread throughout the city . There are also , as it happens , a lot of Japanese flags . A Japanese cultural festival is opening , with exhibitions of prints , sushi samples on the boardwalk , sumo wrestling in the street , barkers enticing passersby to come see these wonders , these monsters : " Come on ! Look at them  --  all white and powdered ! Three hundred pounds ! Legs like hams ! So fat they can ? t even walk ! They needed three seats in the airplane ! Step right up ! " And , therefore , white flags with a red ball , symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balconies on this street of jewelers near the harbor where I ? m searching for a restaurant , to have lunch . In the end , though , it ? s the American flag that dominates . One is struck by the omnipresence of the Star-Spangled Banner , even on the T-shirts of the kids who come to watch the sumo wrestlers as the little crowd cheers them on . // It ? s the flag of the American cavalry in westerns . It ? s the flag of Frank Capra movies . It ? s the fetish that is there , in the frame , every time the American president appears . It ? s the beloved flag , almost a living being , the use of which , I understand , is subject not just to rules but to an extremely precise code of flag behavior : don ? t get it dirty , don ? t copy it , don ? t tattoo it onto your body , never let it fall on the ground , never hang it upside down , don ? t insult it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , if it gets too old , if it can no longer be used , if it can ? t be flown , then you must burn it ; yes , instead of throwing it out or bundling it up , better to burn it than abandon it in the trash . It ? s the flag that was offended by Kid Rock at the Super Bowl , and it ? s the flag of Michael W. Smith in his song " There She Stands , " written just after September 11 , in which " she " is none other than " it , " the flag , the American symbol that was targeted , defiled , attacked , scorned by the barbarians , but is always proudly unfurled . // It ? s a little strange , this obsession with the flag . It ? s incomprehensible for someone who , like me , comes from a country virtually without a flag  --  where the flag has , so to speak , disappeared ; where you see it flying only in front of official buildings ; and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is a sign of an attachment to the past that has become almost ridiculous . Is this flag obsession a result of September 11 ? A response to that trauma whose violence we Europeans persist in underestimating but which , three years later , haunts American minds as much as ever ? Should we reread those pages in Tocqueville on the good fortune of being sheltered by geography from violations of the nation ? s territorial space and come to see in this return to the flag a neurotic abreaction to the astonishment that the violation actually occurred ? Or is it something else entirely ? An older , more conflicted relationship of America with itself and with its national existence ? A difficulty in being a nation , more severe than in the flagless countries of old Europe , that produces this compensatory effect ? // Leafed through the first few pages of One Nation , After All , which the author , the sociologist Alan Wolfe , gave me last night . Maybe the secret lies in this " after all . " Maybe American patriotism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first glance , and perhaps its apparent excessiveness comes from that . Or perhaps it has to do , as Tocqueville saw it , rather with a kind of " reflective patriotism " which , unlike the " instinctive love " that reigned during the regimes of times past , is forced to exaggerate when it comes to emblems and symbols . To be continued . . . // Tell Me What Your Prisons Are . . . // Tocqueville ? s first intention was , we tend to forget , to investigate the American penal system . He went beyond that , of course . He analyzed the political system and American society in its entirety better than anyone . But as his notes , his journal , his letters to Kergorlay and others , and the very text of Democracy in America attest , it was with this business of prisons that everything began , and that ? s why I too , after Newport , asked to see the New York prison of Rikers Island , that city within a city on an island that is not shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take much notice of . // A meeting with Mark J. Cranston , of the New York City Department of Corrections , this Tuesday morning at 5:00 a.m. in Queens , at the entrance to a bridge that doesn ? t lead anywhere open to the public . Landscape of desolate shoreline in the foggy morning light . Electric barbed-wire fences . High walls . A checkpoint , as at the edge of a war zone , where the prison guards , almost all of them black , greet one another as they come on duty , and  --  heading in the opposite direction , packed into barred buses that look like school buses  --  the prisoners , also mainly black , or Hispanic , who are driven with chains on their feet to courthouses in the Bronx and Queens . A security badge along with my photo . Frisked . On the other side of the East River , in the fog , a white boat like a ghost ship , where , for lack of space , the least dangerous criminals are locked up . And very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close that , at times , when the wind blows from a certain quarter , the noise from the planes makes you raise your voice or even stop talking ) , the ten prison buildings that make up this fortress , this enclave cut off from everything , this anti-utopian reservation . // The common room , dirty gray , where the people arrested during the night are assembled , seated on makeshift benches . A small cell , No. 14 , where two prisoners ( white  --  is that by chance ? ) have been isolated . A neater dormitory , with clean sheets , where a sign indicates , as in Manhattan bars , that the zone is " smoke-free . " A man , weirdly agitated , who , taking me for a health inspector , hurries toward me to complain about the mosquitoes . And before we arrive at the detention center proper , before the row of cells , all identical , like minuscule horse stalls , a labyrinth of corridors sliced with bars and opening onto the series of " social " areas they persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volleyball court from which a distant birdsong rises ; a library , where everyone is free , they tell me , to consult law manuals ; another room , finally , where there are three open boxes of letters , marked grievance , legal aid , and social services . At first sight you ? d think it is a dilapidated hospital , but one obsessed with hygiene : the enormous black female guard , her belt studded with keys , who is guiding me through this maze explains that the first thing to do when a delinquent arrives is to have him take a shower in order to disinfect him , later on she tells me  --  in the nice booming voice of a guard who has wound up , since there ? s no other choice , liking these prisoners  --  that the second urgent thing is to run a battery of psychological tests to identify the suicidal temperaments ; prisoners call to her as we pass , insult her because they ? ve been denied the use of the recreation room or the canteen , make farting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop her sometimes to confide a wish to live or die ; it ? s only when you look at them up close , obviously , that things become more complicated . // This man with shackled feet . This other one , handcuffs on his wrists and gloves over the handcuffs , because just last week he hid eight razor blades in his ass before throwing himself on a guard to cut his throat . These wild-animal glares , hard to endure . These prisoners for whom a secure system of serving hatches had to be invented , because they took advantage of the moment when their scrap of food was slid over to them to bite the guard ? s hand . The little Hispanic man , hand on his ear , streaming blood , screaming that he should be taken to the infirmary , under the shouts of his black co-detainees  --  the guard tells me he has a " Rikers cut , " a ritual gash made to the ear or face of an inmate by the big shots of the Latin Kings and the Bloods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fuck yous , the enraged banging on the metal doors in the maximum-security section . Farther on , at the end of the section , in one of the three " shower cells , " which open onto the corridor , the spectacle of a bearded , naked giant jerking off in front of an impassive female guard , to whom he shouts in the voice of a madman , " Come and get me , bitch ! Come on ! " And then the cry of alarm my guard lets out when , dying of thirst , I bend toward a sink in the hallway : " No ! Not there ! Don ? t drink there ! " Marking my surprise , she regains her composure . Excuses herself . Stammers out that it ? s all right , it ? s just the prisoners ? sink , I could have drunk there . But her reflex says a lot about sanitary conditions in the jail . Rikers Island is actually a " jail , " not a " prison . " It accepts those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to less than a year . What would this be like if it were a real prison ? How would these people be treated if they were hardened criminals ? // On the way back with Mark Cranston , taking the bridge that leads to the normal world and noticing what I hadn ? t noticed when I arrived  --  namely , that from where I am and , most likely , from the volleyball court and the exercise yard and even certain cells , you can see , as if you were touching it , the Manhattan skyline  --  I can ? t dodge this question : Does the impression of having brushed with hell arise because Rikers is cut off or because it is so close to everything ? And then another question occurs to me when Cranston , anxious about the impression his " house " has made , explains that the island used to be a huge garbage dump where the city ? s trash was unloaded : Prison or dumping ground ? A kind of replacement , on the same site , of society ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First briefing . // On Religion in General , and Baseball in Particular // Leaving the city behind . Yes , leaving New York , which I know too well . Fast , and through a driving rain . We are on the way to Cooperstown , a miniature village in the central part of the state that has managed at least three times to be in the heart of high-tension zones in American history . It was the town of James Fenimore Cooper , and thus of the symbolic responsibility for the slaughter of the Indians . It lies in a region that , before the Civil War , fleeing slaves and their smugglers passed through . And last but not least , since this is the claim to fame to which it seems most attached , it is the world capital of baseball . // I spend the night in a wooden chalet that has been transformed into a bed-and-breakfast , with ceramic rabbits in the garden and a magazine in the bedroom that explains how to " live comfortably at thirty , " how to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " six ways to get your daily glass of milk . " The house is run by two commanding women , mother and daughter , who wear identical bloodred canvas aprons and look the spitting image of Margaret Thatcher at two stages of her life . I spend time in the morning listening to these ladies tell me the history of their house . The building was actually created a century ago by an officer in the Civil War , but it has been renovated so as to hide all antique traces . " Are you interested in the bed-and-breakfast business , which is the passion of our existence ? " one of them asks . " Is this your first experience ? Did you like it ? I ? m glad you did , since there are as many bed-and-breakfasts as there are owners . Everyone puts their mark on it  --  it ? s an art , a religion . No , that ? s not the word , ? religion. ? We don ? t make any difference here between religions  --  no more than we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way ? " ( She has turned toward a customer in shorts and undershirt who is sitting at the table next to mine . He shrugs as he wolfs down a huge slab of bacon . ) " See , he doesn ? t know . That means it doesn ? t count . And you  --  what are you ? Oh ! Jewish . Oh ! Atheist . That ? s okay . . . Everyone does what they want . . . In this business you have to like ninety-nine percent of your clients . . . " // The breakfast was a little long . But now I ? m in the immense museum , completely disproportionate to the dollhouses in the rest of the town , where this great national sport is honored , this sport that establishes people ? s identities and that has truly become part of their civic and patriotic religion , which is baseball : isn ? t there , in the Hall of Fame adjoining the museum , a plaque devoted to those champions who interrupted their careers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
