Section : Entrepreneurs NEW PRODUCTS George Davison peddles hope to inventors who are down on their luck . Who 's he really helping ? <p> From the outside the headquarters of Davison Design &; Development looks like most other warehouses in northern Pittsburgh . Follow founder George Davison III inside , though , and , as he pushes a button , a bookshelf in a large showroom slides open to reveal not a Bat Cave , but 60,000 square feet of fantasyland . There , 230 employees work among a castle , a pirate ship and a tree house , as well as other childlike sets . Davison , trim and energetic at 42 , has spent 17 years building an enterprise that , in essence , peddles hope to inventors . For a fee , his company will build a prototype and shop it around . If a corporation bites , Davison shares royalties with inventors . Last year , he says , his shop netted $2 million on $25 million in revenue . A sign above the entrance reads : " InventionLand . Dreams are Possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In March a federal district judge in western Pennsylvania  --  responding to a 1997 suit against the company by the Federal Trade Commission  --  ordered that $26 million be repaid to inventors . These victims , he says , were misled by Davison Design 's bogus claims  --  including false representations about how selective the company was in choosing inventions to work with , making misleading promises of close contact with manufacturers and a deceptive claim that the company 's revenue came from sharing royalties with inventors , rather than from the $800 to $12,000 in fees it charged inventors . <p> Davison Design appealed and in July won a stay on the fine from the appeals court . The company filed its brief with the appellate court in early October , but Davison says there may be a settlement hearing . A lawyer for the FTC says it will file its brief in November . <p> The way George Davison tells it , his company gets some 55,000 calls a month from inventors around the U.S. looking for help to turn their ideas into marketable products . Most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via ads on Google ) or in the classified sections of Popular Science , Popular Mechanics , American Baby and Field &; Stream . Inventors pay $800 to see if their ideas conflict with existing patents and whether there 's a potential market . If an invention passes those hurdles , Davison Design charges $10,000 or more to create a prototype of the product . <p> That takes time . To make a gadget called the Can Pump N ' Pour , a circular hard plastic ring with a rubber cover that keeps the fizz in opened soda cans , Davison engineers went through 30 different versions with its own moldmaking machines before getting the shape right . For BikeBoard , a cross between a skateboard ( in the rear ) and a bike ( a tire in front ) , the R &D; group used a plasma cutting machine on the metal , and tube-bending and welding machines to fashion the curves . Once the prototype is done , the company searches for a corporate licensee , then keeps 10% to 20% of royalties , if they occur . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on top of spitting out 200 prototypes a month . <p> Successes ? In the showroom next to InventionLand , Davison shows off some items that have been licensed . There 's a Victorinox Swiss Army knife with a built-in warning whistle ; a plastic Magna Jar with a magnet built into the lid , for storing nails and screws ; and a rubber Oil Filter Gripper that acts as a potholder for someone removing a hot filter from a car engine . <p> Not one has been a blockbuster , although Davison says Home Depot is doing a private-label version of the Magna Jar . By law  --  the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999  --  the company Web site must disclose its batting average . In this case 37,000 or so people have contracted Davison Design 's services in the last five years ; but only eight of those who have signed up have realized royalties exceeding their fees to Davison . If those odds are n't discouraging enough , consider this from a document the Pennsylvania federal judge ordered sent to inventors : As of late October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalties paid on licensed products . Assuming the company does n't have trouble with decimal points , the royalty business provides Davison $250 a year in sales . ( It 's probably closer to $25,000 . ) <p> The $4 Can Pump N ' Pour can be had on Organize.com as well as at Linens ' n Things and some grocery stores . You can buy the BikeBoard ( $70 and up ) in sporting goods chains and FAO Schwarz . But as for getting rich quick  --  or even slow ? The bike 's inventor , John Iavarone , acknowledges he has made " some money , " but not millions of dollars . " I 'm satisfied , " he says . " Just to see your product on the shelves is enough . " Iavarone cut a separate deal with a manufacturer in China , and is now trying to sell his company . <p> Other Davison customers are far from satisfied . Kam J. Henson , a pharmaceutical salesman from Boise , Idaho , came up with the Shoe-Vine  --  a string of detachable shoe trees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet wall  --  and says he paid Davison Design $8,000 in 2003 to create a prototype . Davison told him he would target Richards Homewares of Portland , Ore. , which makes storage products . Henson claims he was told not to contact Richards directly . " It was a pretty good sales pitch , " says Henson . " I mean , I 'm in sales . " <p> A Davison employee later told Henson that Richards was n't interested . But he asked for several hundred dollars more  --  as a " repackaging " fee  --  to target another manufacturer . Henson sent the money but became suspicious when the UPS tracking slip said the prototype weighed less than one pound . He did n't think the product sample could be so light . Henson ended up calling Richards Homewares and talking to the company president , Robert Freelander , who assured him he had never received a prototype . Henson repeatedly called Davison Design , asking it to send back his prototype , but he says no one returned his calls . " I got totally screwed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the company sent him a prototype ( it weighed more than a pound ) ; Henson says it does n't work . <p> Davison explains that he never promises a hit with manufacturers : " We 're going to be in the 1% area " when it comes to successful inventions , he says . <p> Mark Nickerson is n't happy , either . The Garner , N.C. owner of a home-improvement business plunked down roughly $9,000 for a prototype of his invention  --  Color Link , a desktop keyboard that illuminates the keys in four different colors to help folks learn to type . He was told the idea would be pitched to Spec Research , a City of Industry , Calif. maker of PC peripherals . Nickerson says that after he gave the go-ahead , Davison Design decided to target an outfit called Arista Enterprises , a Hauppauge , N.Y . maker of audio products like cable connectors  --  but not keyboards . Arista declined to license Color Link . Then , says Nickerson , Davison Design asked him for more money to chase another company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times with zero results . " No way , I 'm not sending you another dime , " Nickerson recalls telling the Davison employee . <p> Nickerson says he called Arista and found out his keyboard had been sent in a FedEx box that had n't been opened . " This guy Al at Arista told me my presentation was on a spreadsheet with a bunch of other stuff . I was under the impression this was going to be handled with kid gloves , " says Nickerson , who once entertained hopes that he could make a few million dollars off his keyboard . <p> Plenty of other folks have complained about the company on the Web site RipoffReport.com . George Davison insists he 's trying to resolve the problems . In a letter sent to the site he offers a full or partial refund to unhappy clients  --  if he deems the complaints have merit . The offer may make a few people whole . But it wo n't change the long odds for most would-be Thomas Edisons . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Heck on wheels : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's product he has successfully brought to market . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Not white knights of the round table but so-called Inventionmen , discussing designs and building prototypes of inventions . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Kerry A.
