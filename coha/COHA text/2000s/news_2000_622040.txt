<p> " Stop that line ! " yelled Jill Tucker as she strode through the factory . <p> The assembly line slowed to a halt . The young women who were busy gluing parts of Reebok sneakers looked up in surprise , while flustered male supervisors scurried around . <p> Tucker pointed . " They 're not wearing gloves . It 's the same problem as before . This is ridiculous , " she said . <p> Gloves quickly were found and donned , thus protecting the workers from the toxic cement , and the gluing resumed . <p> Behold the best-case scenario for U.S. corporate behavior in China . <p> Tucker is Reebok 's human rights director for East Asia . Her job is to make sure that the firm 's factories are free of health and safety hazards and other sweatshop-style labor abuses . <p> She is part of a new attempt by some leading American firms to improve working conditions in China 's notoriously harsh factories . The success or failure of their work is central to the debate in Washington over whether to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate investment help improve the human rights situation and pave the way for democracy in China , as the Clinton administration and the trade bill 's backers say ? Or , as opponents contend , are U.S. firms simply profiteering from communist repression , taking advantage of 20-cents-per-hour wages and the Chinese government 's denial of workers ' rights ? <p> During recent travels by two Chronicle journalists throughout the vast Pearl River delta industrial zone of southern China 's Guangdong province , interviews with dozens of workers , company and government officials uncovered plenty of evidence to support both conclusions . <p> It was clear that Reebok and ( to a lesser extent ) other American firms are making changes for the better . They provide jobs , improve working conditions and set a relatively good example for Chinese and other foreign firms , whose factory conditions are generally draconian . <p> But it was equally clear that some of the U.S. firms ' own practices do not meet the corporations ' own codes of conduct or international labor-rights norms . Nor have they prompted the Chinese government to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights standards . <p> In Zhongshan , Tucker 's reform plans are complicated by the fact that she is not really in charge . As in nearly all other plants producing for U.S. brands in southern China , the factory is owned and operated by a subcontractor  --  in this case , Yue Yuen , a Taiwanese firm . Yue Yuen , which also makes shoes for New Balance , Timberland and Dr. Martens at the same factory , produces for nearly all other American brands at other plants . <p> Yue Yuen may be unknown to U.S. consumers , but it is a colossus in the wholesale footwear industry . The firm 's factories in China , Indonesia , Vietnam , Taiwan and Los Angeles produced 14 percent of all branded athletic footwear sold worldwide in 1999 , as well as 14 percent of casual shoes  --  adding up to a total of 87 million pairs . <p> The Zhongshan factory , for example , is as big as a small city , with 35,000 workers , nearly all of whom live on site in highrise dormitories . <p> During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was apparent that her frequent outbursts  --  pointing out missing gloves here , missing goggles and the wrong kind of solvent there  --  were not just a show for the press . <p> In December , because of similar problems , Reebok punished Yue Yuen by transferring about $40 million in annual sneaker contracts from the Zhongshan plant to one elsewhere in China owned by another firm . <p> And because of pressure from Reebok and other American firms , Yue Yuen has ended several practices that had earned harsh criticism from human rights groups  --  including its system of fining workers for misbehavior and its practice of paying mainly by piece rate . <p> " Reebok 's concerns have helped us pay more attention to human rights issues , " said Edward Ku , executive director of Yue Yuen . He said that within a year , the company would switch completely to less toxic , water-based glues on all its factories ' production lines  --  another longtime demand of activists , who say the chemicals cause health problems among workers . <p> Evident throughout the factory is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern paternalism . Slogans everywhere exhort workers : " Work diligently because life is hard and short ( The spirit of Yue Yuen ) . " <p> But Wang Pingli , one of the 35,000 workers , says she is happy she made the trip late last year from her village in Shaanxi province , 800 miles to the northwest . <p> Yue Yuen " is the best place to work in the area , because the factory takes care of me , " she said . <p> To Wang , what makes Yue Yuen a desirable place to work is its zhi du  --  a system of rules partly derived from Reebok 's code of conduct and partly from Yue Yuen 's own Confucian ethos . <p> Zhi du regulates the conduct of both management and workers . It means , among other things , that Wang works a maximum of 60 hours per week , with five days of paid vacation a year , three months of maternity leave if she gets pregnant , the services of a company clinic and a pair of Reebok shoes as an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , she is paid on time , once a month . <p> Wang gets three meals a day and a bunk bed in a 12-woman room in a high-rise dormitory . Factory regulations stipulate that she place her toothbrush in just the right angle in her rinse cup , hang her face towel just so , participate in early-morning drills and obey the 11:30 p.m. curfew . <p> In return , Wang is paid 650 yuan , or about $80 , per month . To her , it 's a good deal , because back in her village she earned nothing . In a few years ' time she will have saved enough for a dowry , she said . " Or maybe enough to start a shop of my own , " she added brightly . <p> But there are sticky details , which seem to show the limits of Tucker 's good intentions . <p> For one , the 60-hour week violates Chinese federal labor law , which sets a maximum of 49 hours . Though the law is ignored throughout Guangdong and other export-production zones in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those of other U.S. companies , pledges compliance with national labor laws in all countries they operate in . <p> More important , from the point of view of the AFL-CIO and human rights activists who oppose U.S. trade concessions to China , is the violation of internationally recognized labor organizing rights . <p> At the Zhongshan factory and everywhere else in China , labor peace is guaranteed by the only union allowed , the All-China Federation of Trade Unions , controlled by the Communist Party and factory management . Strikes are banned and union functions are mostly limited to organizing after-hours recreation programs . <p> The union president is invariably a management executive . The union boss at the Reebok section of the plant , Xu Lan Ying , is also the section 's personnel director . She said her main purpose as union chief is " to help the factory run smoother and more productively . " <p> Although Xu said she had been chosen in a democratic union election , she could produce no documentation to prove it . When asked about the union outside the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever occurred . Several were even unaware of the union 's existence . <p> When first asked about the union , Tucker also was unaware that it existed . Later , she said it was " not really a union , " and Reebok had never communicated with it . <p> Human rights groups say that elsewhere in China , workers who disobey their union chiefs or try to organize independent unions are automatically fired or worse . Dozens of labor activists are languishing in prison on charges of " disrupting public order " or " counterrevolutionary crimes . " <p> " If you try to compare Yue Yuen with many small companies , it 's paradise , " said Chan Kawai , executive director of Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee , a labor-rights group that has carried out extensive studies in Zhongshan and at other south China factories . <p> " But the fundamental rights of workers  --  the right to freedom of organization and the right to collective bargaining  --  are still repressed . Because they are so big , Reebok and Yue Yuen should do more to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its efforts in Zhongshan , Reebok is undeniably a leader of the corporate reform movement . Along with other European and American firms such as Adidas , Levi Strauss , Nike and Mattel , it has hired dozens of inspectors to check factories for substandard conditions . <p> Tucker is an example . Formerly the director of International Development Exchange , a liberal San Francisco group that carries out small-scale aid projects in poor nations , she also worked at the Asia Society in Indonesia before being hired by Reebok . <p> Tucker seems torn by the criticism , defending her record while agreeing with much of what her detractors say . " Shoes are going to be made in China no matter what , " she said . " It 's the reality of the industry . I think we just have to do whatever we can to improve things . " <p> But where there are no Jill Tuckers or zhi du , working conditions are grim indeed . <p> Workers at other factories in Guangdong say rampant exploitation and poor conditions are routine . Workers are forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , protective equipment is rare , physical abuse common , dorms filthy and unexplained " penalties " often reduce paychecks to near zero . <p> U.S. human rights groups have harshly criticized Disney , Wal-Mart , K-Mart and the Gap for conditions in their Chinese factories . They say these companies , and others like them , will be big beneficiaries of China 's expected entry this year into the World Trade Organization , which will phase out U.S. apparel and textile import quotas and stimulate yet more foreign investment in Guangdong . <p> Zhongshan 's deputy mayor , Wu Rui Cheng , said he wants to attract more companies like Reebok  --  or DuPont and Union Carbide , and many others that have local factories . But when asked about Reebok 's human rights pressure , he wrinkled his nose . " We have our own laws about how to treat workers , " he said . <p> In fact , many U.S. firms seem to give the Chinese government contradictory messages about reform . The American Chamber of Commerce in China recently distributed to all top government officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes to Chinese laws and regulations that affect foreign investors . The government has already made some of the requested changes . <p> But the report fails to mention any of the U.S. critics ' concerns  --  enforcement of workplace health , safety , environmental and labor laws , and union rights . And the report goes so far as to ask the government to cut labor costs  --  especially in coastal areas such as Guangdong  --  because it says wages there are " among the highest for developing countries in Asia . . . . These high labor costs have already discouraged some potential investors . " <p> That raises the hackles of Medea Benjamin , director of Global Exchange , a San Francisco group cooperating with Reebok , Mattel , Levi Strauss and other organizations to create a common set of rules for U.S. firms ' factories in China . <p> " Unlike the rhetoric that companies have a democratizing effect , most U.S. companies are not only taking advantage of China 's low wages and repression , but they 're actually pressing the government to lower standards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his group 's stand . " I do n't see any contradiction with our members ' codes of conduct , " he said . " We 're upholding the highest standards , and we 're living by them . "
