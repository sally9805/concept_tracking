The 650-horsepower Toyota Tundras thundering around Daytona International Speedway last month were 190-mile-per-hour proof that you can teach new dogs old tricks In becoming the first foreign automaker to crash the emphatically American party of Nascar , Toyota adopted a modern approach to designing a vintage Detroit engine . Nascar 's immense popularity is based in part on rules that promote pure competition by limiting pricey technological innovation . That means 358-cubic-inch V8 engines whose fundamental architecture dates back to the Eisenhower Administration . But this did not stop Toyota from employing the most advanced software and manufacturing tools in the auto industry to design its old-school motor . Call it the highest-tech low-tech engine ever built When Toyota decided to enter the Craftsman Truck Series  --  third in the Nascar hierarchy , behind the Nextel ( ne Winston ) Cup and Busch Grand National  --  it found itself in a peculiar predicament . The company had n't built the mandated pushrod , carbureted , iron-block V8 since , well , ever . This forced the team at Toyota Racing Development ( TRD )  --  one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to start from scratch " We told them to take a look around at the engines in the garage , " Nascar R &D; director Gary Nelson says . " We said , ' We 're not going to tell you what valve angle to use , for example . But go smaller than the largest and larger than the smallest . ' " In other words , no thinking outside the box Trouble is , nobody knew the precise dimensions of that box . " So we had to reverse engineer the Chevy , Ford and Dodge engines , " says Lee White , general manager of TRD . " We measured 3,000 block castings and 2,000 cylinder head castings for each one  --  15,000 total . " The TRD team set out to incorporate the best features of each engine , while hunting for Nascar-legal design tweaks . They used advanced engineering software to calculate stresses on the cylinder heads , plus computer-aided design and stereo lithography to quickly mold plastic parts . All standard in the automotive industry but fairly new to Nascar , these high-tech tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was also a little old-fashioned design ingenuity . Early on , says David Currier , who led the seven-man design team , it became clear that Nascar 's design parameters for the valvetrain , which helps control fuel intake and exhaust , was the engine 's weak link , as it was conceived to handle a modest 5,000 rpm . To circumvent Nascar 's valvetrain restrictions , TRD minimized the stroke . By shortening the distance traveled by the piston , they ended up with an engine that should spin faster than 9,000 rpm After frustrating negotiations with Nascar and nearly $2 million in development costs , TRD has produced the requisite engine , but one with enough subtle innovations to boost performance on the track . TRD technical director Pete Spence believes he has the lightest engine in the series , and he 's experimenting with blocks cast out of compacted graphite to cut more weight Daytona is just the first step on a long road featuring 23 more Craftsman races this year .
