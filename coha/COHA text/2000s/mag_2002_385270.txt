And all you have to do to discover them is take one little quiz ... By Pamela Lister // " Wow ! That was amazing ! " gasps your husband after making love . Tickled as you are about his satisfaction , the truth is , you do n't have a clue why the sex was so intense for him tonight of all nights . Was it that last-second squeeze ? The fact that you kept the lights  --  or your short white socks-on ? Good loving is in the details , those unexpected little moves that keep sex new , spontaneous , and exciting . And thinking up those fresh ideas is easier than it sounds . When it comes to men 's secret sexual desires , most guys break down into three basic categories . And all around you , every day , they 're dropping tiny but telling hints about their core sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So take this test and see what your mate 's behavior out of bed says about what he wants in bed . Then show him your newfound attention to detail , a talent that will leave him happy again and again and again . Scoring : So what does your husband 's view of gifts , working overtime , and Sunday dinner have to do with sex ? Simple : How he relates to the world is also how he relates in bed . And broadly speaking , most men will respond primarily in one of three ways : with their bodies , their minds , or their emotions . Of course , there 's always some crossover and your husband 's style may change as he does , but to find out what turns him on today-and tonight-find his profile below . If you answered mostly A 's : Photograph Listen up . It 's gon na feel great to know exactly what he wants . // HE 'S A PHYSICAL GUY While not necessarily a jock , your dude does care about staying fit : not just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionally centered , and physically primed . Maybe he was an athlete in high school or college ; he probably still runs or plays basketball on weekends . This guy gets cranky if he goes too long without pumping his endorphins . He needs to sweat and test his strength and stamina to feel alive . Because he knows his physical limits , he 's got a lot of confidence in other areas , from parenting to work performance . He 's comfortable taking charge , and if he goofs once or twice , it 's no biggie . This guy is resilient . His sexual profile : Whether or not you 've got the body of a centerfold does n't matter as much to your man as your attitude does : It 's extremely important to him that you like your body . He 's so into the raw carnality of sex that false modesty ( complaining about your giganto thighs , for example ) will turn him off .

" Performance is very important to him , so be an active sex partner , " explains Denver-based psychotherapist Carolyn Bushong , author of The Seven Dumbest Relationship Mistakes Smart People Make . " You do n't have to be real aggressive , but participate and be open to new ideas . Do n't just lie there . " Little moves to try : Your body in motion is a major turn-on for him , so when you 're making love , go for angles that 'll give him great visuals . From behind he 'll appreciate your toned back muscles ; when you 're on top , make like you 're doing rush-ups over his chest to show off your sexy arms . He adores the curves of your hips , and he likes that you marvel at his angles and definition , too . If you hang a mirror close to the bed , he 'll be in bliss . Full-body worship is also high on his list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch for new erogenous zones ( try the inner thighs , the toes , the soles of the feet , the very low part of his back ) , using your nails , fingertips , lips , tongue , and extras ( such as ice cubes and warm oil ) . Also , this is a man who responds immediately to verbal coaxing : He 's probably heard words such as " harder " and " faster " on the playing field his whole life , so if you want to push him over the edge , just say them in rapid succession as if you were his personal trainer . He 's unabashedly turned on by grand , unimaginative compliments , such as " You 're an incredible lover . " And he 's fine with directions : " My husband likes me to tell him what I want and where to touch me , and he also likes me to let him know when he 's got it right . I think he gets a little bored if he has to guess too much , " says Kathryn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triathlon last summer . What he 'd like to see you in : Lots of sweat . Setting he 'll enjoy : The airplane bathroom . Fantasy he 'll enjoy : Doing it smack-dab in the middle of Dodger Stadium . It you answered mostly B 's : HE 'S A THINKER Your husband lives in his head , so his imagination is always cranking . Part brainiac , part analyst ( he wants to know why you do what you do ) , he 's well read , thrives on stimulating conversation , and has an eye for beauty . He 'll notice when you highlight your hair . His sexual profile : Desire begins in his brain , so fantasy and seduction are crucial . He loves the little rituals of preparing for love , such as watching you brush your hair . ( Why not ask him to brush it for you ? ) And since aesthetics are an integral part of his sexuality , he 'll appreciate your arranging the perfect setting , from soft candlelight to soulful music . " For him , everything contributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sharyn Wolf , a New York marriage counselor and author of How to Stay Lovers for Life . But his favorite type of foreplay is verbal . " He loves to talk about what he 's going to do , and he wants you to talk about what you 're going to do , " says Wolf . He 'll also appreciate a dirty note or a suggestive phone call to his office . Because he 's got such an active imagination , he may be into sexual games ; the tease , the chase , and the balance of power are turn-ons for him . The only thing that will turn this man off is a cliche . Little moves to try : The more creative you are , the further he 's willing to go . " He 's not just penis-oriented , " says Wolf . " He thinks of all the permutations two bodies can have . " Erotica is a major turn-on , but not cheap porn .

Play to his love for new ideas by not seducing him in bed : try the dining-room rug or the back porch . Your husband 's also a sucker for lingerie , but nothing predictable , please . Slip on virginal white one night , a vampy red corset the next , and let him fill in the details of the " character " your clothes suggest . Whisper to him seductively in any bits of a foreign language you can dredge up , then put your hand over his eyes so he can come up with whatever images he wants to savor .

( He 'll let you go on forever about your boss , your mom , and your fears about growing old . ) He loves your heart and cares mostly about making it sing . His sexual profile : Do n't bother showering before sex , because he loves your natural scent . And relax about those five extra pounds you gained in the winter ; they 're not even on his radar . " He 's more interested in what 's inside you and what makes you tick , " Wolf explains . Because he 's so much more driven by internal rather than external events , he 'll be more turned on by your understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , if you remember something sexy that caught his interest , especially if he mentioned it only in passing . " Your recognition and recollection of what he enjoys are what make him feel great , " says Wolf . The more you bare your innermost thoughts and feelings , the stronger his sexual attraction . For what strikes his heart will pretty soon strike his-well , you know . Little moves to try : He wants you to enjoy yourself during sex as much as he does . So if it 's easier for you to give yourself an orgasm , to use a vibrator with him , or to always be on top , he 's all for it . He likes to know you 're as turned on as he is , so be vocal : Your desire will multiply his . And as you climax , up the volume . Your pleasure will send him to the moon .

" Whenever we have the house to ourselves , he 's as horny as a teenager . " If you have an hour alone , play around with the idea behind Tantric sex . Just hold each other 's naked bodies , breathe together , and let erotic feelings build . Because he 's such a softie , your husband will be touched-and aroused-by sentimental gestures , so put on a CD of his favorite love songs while you 're in bed .
