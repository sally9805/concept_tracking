Section : CE <p> Pelvic fractures can be a big challenge in caring for the injured patient . Pelvic fractures are important as a cause for morbidity and mortality . The mortality can be 30% with unstable pelvic ring injuries , and 10-12% of this percentage alone is due to blood loss . Multiple complications can occur during a pelvic fracture . This article will help nurses assess and manage patients with pelvic injuries . Topics covered in the article include basic anatomy of the pelvis , diagnostic tests performed after a pelvic fracture , types of pelvic fractures , management of pelvic fractures , and complications . Epidemiology <p> The mechanisms of injury of pelvic fractures include motor vehicle crashes , 57% ; pedestrians hit by motor vehicles , 18% ; motorcycle crushes , 9% : falls , 9% ; and crush injuries , 5% ( Failinger &; McGanity , 1992 ; Heetveld , Harris , Schlaphoff , &; Sugrue , 2004 ) . Mortality of the patient increases with the severity of the pelvic injury . The patient with a closed pelvic fracture who is hemodynamically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approximately 55% for open pelvic fractures ( Heetveld el al. , 2004 ) . <p> The unstable pelvic fracture can cause the most damage and is life threatening . The " open book " pelvic fracture is a type of fracture , and it will be discussed further in this article . The complications that can occur are massive , such as exsanguination ( blood loss ) , genitourinary trauma , sepsis , chronic pain , bowel damage , neurological damage , and laceration of the vagina ( Walsh , 2002 ) . <p> This article explores traumatic pelvic fractures , classifications of injury , complications of pelvic fractures , and different forms of management and nursing implications . Anatomy of the Pelvis <p> The pelvis is a ring structure made up are three bones : the sacrum and two innominate bones . The fusion of three ossification centers , the ilium , the ischium , and the pubis , makes up the innominate bone . The pelvic ring is formed by the connection of the sacrum to the innominate bones at the sacroiliac ( SI ) joints and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pelvis . The strongest and the most important ligamentous structures occur in the posterior aspect of the pelvis at the SI joints . The posterior ligaments have to hold up the weight-bearing forces that occur from the lower extremities to the spine and are transferred to the SI joints ( Kellam &; Mayo , 2003 ) . The interosseous SI ligaments are considered the strongest in the body . They act to stabilize the SI complex . The symphysis acts more as a supporting " strut " because the SI joint is the stabilizing structure of the pelvic ring . If this " strut " is disturbed , this will not lead to instability of the pelvic ring and surgery ( Young &; Burgess , 1987 ) . <p> The major blood vessels located on the inner wall of the pelvis are the median sacral artery and the superior rectal artery ; the common iliac divides to give off the external iliac and the internal iliac , which also branches off to give the superior gluteal artery During a pelvic fracture , these arteries and associated veins can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected during a trauma within the pelvis are the genitourinary system ( bladder and urethra ) , the vagina , prostate , and gastrointestinal system . The lumbar and sacral plexuses that run posterior can also be affected during pelvic trauma ( See Figures 1-3 ) . History and Physical Examination <p> When a patient comes into the emergency room , the important aspects of his or her history are the mechanism of injury , location and where the pain radiates to , if gross hematuria is present in the urine post injury , last menstrual period , and possibility of pregnancy . <p> On physical examination , one would inspect to see if there was a rotation of the iliac crests . Rotation would indicate a serious pelvic fracture . Leg-length differences may suggest a hip injury or headward migration of an unstable hemipelvis . Gentle lateral compression and distraction of the iliac crests and gentle inward compression of the symphysis pubis are done to determine the stability of the pelvic ring . It is vitally important to be careful in maneuvering the pelvis so as not to cause potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds is needed to identify open fractures . Perineal ecchymosis or hematoma may be observed . The digital examination should be done to evaluate sensation , sphincter tone , position and consistency of the prostate , and presence of frank or occult blood . Women should undergo a vaginal examination to diagnose a possible open fracture . Urine may be detected in the scrotum or subcutaneous tissues of ( he penis , vulva , or abdominal wall . Pulses should be palpated for presence and quality in the lower extremities and for sensation , strength , and deep tendon reflexes . Diagnostic Tests Radiology <p> Radiographic images are obtained for patients who have experienced blunt trauma . It helps to determine the extent of the pelvic fracture . Radiographic images are considered the gold standard in determining a pelvic fracture . An anterior-posterior ( AP ) view of the pelvis will show most of the pelvic fractures and dislocations . However , this view does not allow one to determine the degree of bone displacement ; small fractures can be missed . Inlet and outlet views are also obtained for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2002 ) . <p> The inlet view is taken from the head toward the feet at 60 with the patient lying supine . This view can show the posterior and cephalic displacement of the fractures of the posterior arch , widening of the SI joint , and inward displacement of the anterior arch . <p> The outlet view is taken from the foot of the bed directed at 45 toward the head . This type of X ray helps in determining the displacement or leg-length discrepancy , sacral fractures , and disruptions of the SI joints . The inlet and outlet X-ray views can be taken by simply angling the beam , thus not having to move the patient ( Kellam &; Mayo , 2003 ) . Computed Tomography <p> The CT scan plays an important part in determining the exact nature of the posterior injury It can diagnose a crushing , shearing injury , SI joint displacement , acetabular injuries , and posterior osseous ligamentous structure of the pelvis . A CT scan can also help diagnose associated visceral injuries and hemorrhage . <p> The advances in technology have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal more information in evaluation of the overall displacement of the pelvic fracture . The CT scan also helps prepare the surgeon by providing a clear visibility of the upper sacral vertebral bodies and lumbosacral junction in assessing the anatomic abnormalities of the area . The visualization of the anatomic abnormalities is important in preparation for stabilization and treatment of the L5-S1 facet joint injuries . Classifications of Pelvic Injuries <p> A classification is essentially a description of the bone injury ; it does not define the injury . In defining the injury you need to look at all of the following : degree of displacement ; stability of ( he pelvic ring ; force direction ; state of the soft tissues , including whether the fracture is open or closed ; anatomic injury in the pelvis and the associated injuries ( Tile , Helfet , &; Kellam , 2003 ) . <p> At this time there is no universally accepted classification system of determining pelvic fractures . There are different descriptions or classifications of the pelvic ring fractures . Letournel classified the fractures of the pelvic ring anatomically . Bucholz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractures by the stability of the fracture . Based on the Pennal classification , Young and Burgess classified pelvic fractures by the mechanism of injury , in other words , how the injury was obtained ( Guyton &; Crockarell , 2003 ) . This article will focus on the Tile classification and the Young and Burgess classification . Young and Burgess Classification <p> According to the Young and Burgess classification , injuries are grouped by mechanism of injury . They show it is important to think of three vectors of force and how this disrupts the pelvic ring . First , the most common vector of force is the lateral compression ( LC ) . The vector force is applied from the lateral side of the pelvic ring from a T-bone ( intersectional motor vehicle crash ) or in a situation in which a pedestrian is struck from the side or a person lands from a great height on his or her side , Usually , in this type of injury the individual is injured mostly from associated injuries of the abdomen , thoracic contents , and the cervical spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up the pelvis but can cause great damage to the internal organs from fracture fragments ( Scalea &; Burgess , 2004 ) . An exception to this classification is when a LC-III injury occurs . If the lateral force that contacts one side of the pelvis creates an internal rotation , which continues to the opposite side of the pelvis creating an external rotation injury , an LC-III injury results . This is called a " windswept " pelvis . This type of injury is brought on by both initial impact and secondary crush injury ( Burgess et al. , 1990 ) . It commonly occurs when a pedestrian is struck , then rolled over by a motor vehicle . <p> The next type of vector force , which can impact the pelvis , is either from the anterior or posterior ( AP ) direction . The injuries are mostly ligamentous with possible pubic rami fractures . The force is either at the iliac spine or through the femur . An example of this injury is often seen when a person 's legs are spread apart in a motorcycle accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AP-III is usually called the " open book " pelvis , with complete disruption of all the SI ligaments , and it results in separate hemipelves . Usually this type of injury is associated with severe arterial damage , the internal iliac artery , and adjacent veins . Lumbosacral plexus injuries also usually occur . <p> The last example of vector force is the vertical shear ( VS ) that causes vertical shear injury . This usually occurs when a person jumps from a great height and lands on an extended lower extremity or other associated events . The injury will demonstrate an ipsilateral disruption of all the restraining ligaments of the hemipelvis , including the symphyseal , sacrospinous , sacrotuberous , and SI ligaments . This type of injury usually does not involve major arterial injuries of the posterior pelvic vascular complexes ( Scalea &; Burgess , 2004 ) . <p> The complex mixed ( CM ) pattern of injuries does not fit into the other categories neatly . These injuries result from a combination of the aforementioned types of injuries ( See Figure 4 and Table 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries according to the stability of the pelvic ring and the integrity of the posterior sacroiliac complex . The classifications start with minor complications ( pelvic ring being stable ) and increase to more complex injuries and complete instability of the posterior pelvic ring . The classification begins with minor complications , type A fractures that have no major instability of the posterior ring . <p> Type B fractures are fractures that are partially stable . They may have anterior displacement through the symphysis and/or pubic rami but no vertical or posterior displacement other than that allowed by rotation of the hemipelvis , usually less than 1 cm . <p> Type C fractures are unstable . These fractures are always caused by severe trauma such as from a crushing injury , motor vehicle crash , or fall from a great height . This injury involves the complete disruption of the posterior SI complex , involving vertical shear forces . This fracture can involve one or both sides of the pelvis ( Tile el al. , 2003 ) ( See Table 2 ) . Table 3 shows the comparison of the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pelvic fractures . The table demonstrates that the Young and Burgess classification is more condensed than the Tile classification . Surgical Management of Pelvic Fractures Pelvic Girdle <p> The pelvic girdle may be used for an unstable pelvic fracture . The girdle acts as a temporary fix until surgical interventions can be initiated . A bedsheet may also be used temporarily to help stabilize the pelvic girdle . The bedsheet is placed underneath the patient and crossed over the anterior pelvis area to reduce the pelvic fracture . The bedsheet will stabilize the fracture and reduce the internal bleeding until fixation can be performed . Bottlang , Drieg , Mohr , Simpson , &; Madey ( 2002 ) showed some means of circumferential pelvic compression for immediate temporary reduction and stabilization of open-book pelvic fractures , such as a pelvic sling or girdle is effective , noninvasive and safe . External Fixation <p> In unstable patients , an emergent external fixation can be placed in the emergency room . An external fixation is usually applied to the " open book " or externally rotated pelvic fracture , an internally rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reduce the amount of blood loss by causing a tamponade effect on the retroperitoneal hematoma . After the application of the external fixation , the fracture moves less . This assists in clot formation and allows the patient to become more mobile in transportation to the CT scan facility and other areas for evaluation . Early stabilization can help the nurse provide appropriate care to the patient , facilitate pulmonary toilet , decrease pain , and enable the patient to sit upright . Several types of external fixates can be used ( See Figures 5 and 6 ) . It is recommended to use a simple anterior frame with two 5-mm pins in each iliac wing . A C-clamp can also be used , which helps stabilize the posterior aspect of the pelvis . Internal Fixation <p> Internal fixation has become the treatment of choice for treating the patients after they become more hemodynamically stable . The benefits include the following : it helps in obtaining and maintaining anatomic reduction of the fracture ; it is biomechanically a more stable fixation ; it is a safer technique for stabilization ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortens hospitalization ; it eases nursing care of the patient ; and it improves outcomes in the patient care management ( Tile et al. , 2003 ) . There are different techniques and surgical procedures that can be performed in reducing a pelvic fracture by internal fixation . It depends on the fracture type , type of fixation used , and surgeon 's technique . <p> The following are the general guidelines in the fixation of pelvic fractures by Jones &; Burgess ( 2001 ) . In LC-I , and AP-I pelvic fractures , the injuries are minimally displaced , and ligamentous stability of the pelvic ring still exists with partial disruption of the bony structure . In this case , these patients are treated with protected weight bearing on the affected side and symptomatic treatment . Further surgical treatment might be needed if displacement of the fracture occurs after the patient starts to weight bear . Follow-up X rays can determine the displacement after 2-5 days of physical therapy . <p> In AP-II and LC-I pelvic fractures , the patient has a marked displacement of the anterior ring without complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with reduction and anterior ring stabilization . <p> In LC-II , LC-III , AP-III , and VS pelvic fractures , there is complete disruption of the posterior ring , and , in general , the patients require stabilization of both the anterior and posterior pelvic ring . According to Tile 's classification , Table 4 shows the type of pelvic ring fixation one would use . Nursing Management of Pelvic Fractures Prefixation <p> Pelvic fractures could be a life-ending event especially dealing with open-book fractures . The nurse 's primary role is to assess the patient and be alert to the signs and symptoms of potential complications by performing a careful examination . The nurse should be suspicious and aware that other injuries could have occurred . It is important to keep the patient 's pain under control . It is also important to keep the patient still after a pelvic girdle is applied to prevent disruption of the retroperitoneal tamponade , which could lead to hemorrhagic shock . The nurse is the first line of defense in recognizing complications . Postfixation <p> The nurse needs to watch for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can occur when a patient has sustained a traumatic pelvic injury . These complications include bleeding , infection at the incised site of any open wounds , pulmonary emboli , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , and pneumonia . Controlling the patient 's pain is important to help with early ambulation and in preventing the above complications . Good pulmonary toilet by the nurse and patient can prevent respiratory complications . Rehabilitation <p> Rehabilitation is an important aspect of the care of a patient with a pelvic fracture . Physical therapy needs to start early to mobilize the patient to prevent further complications . Rehabilitation can last long depending on the type of fracture and the condition that other injuries or complications had occurred . Complications of Pelvic Fractures Internal Injuries <p> Patients who sustain pelvic fractures usually have other complications associated with this injury . The most life-threatening injury is to blood vessels that can cause large amounts of blood loss . This large amount of blood loss can be associated with long bone fractures , and especially pelvic fractures . Aortic tears or lacerations usually occur in AP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients with pelvic fractures . Visceral injuries such as a bladder rupture ( genitourinary injury ) , a diaphragmatic injury , or a small bowel injury can also occur . Urethral injuries are uncommon in women but they do exist . Urethral injuries are usually associated with bilateral pubic rami fractures , significant vertical displacement of the pelvis , and symphyseal disruption . Nerve injury occurs usually when there is a posterior pelvic injury , but it is difficult to determine because a pelvic fracture can also cause the same type of pain or mask the nerve pain in a particular area . It is important to complete a full physical examination of the patient at the time of admission to detect these other injuries ( See Table 5 ) . Delayed Complications <p> DVT can occur in pelvic fractures . Most patients who have these types of fractures are immobile for large periods of time and become highly susceptible to thromboembolism . Compression devices and appropriate anticoagulation therapy can help prevent DVT . Inferior caval filter can also be used in preventing pulmonary embolism . A pulmonary embolis or fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelvic fracture . Atelectasis and pneumonia can also occur from immobilization . It is important for the patient to perform pulmonary toilet and get up out of bed as soon as possible . Infections due to open wounds that occur during the initial injury , pin site infections , and infections at incised sites can also occur . Other long-term complications with pelvic fractures consist of back pain , sexual dysfunction , impotence , and dyspareunia as documented in the literature . Malunion and nonunion of the surgical site is also documented in the literature . Conclusion <p> Traumatic pelvic fractures can be complicated in the nursing care of the patient . Therefore , it is extremely important to assess , educate , and treat the patient with a pelvic fracture . Nursing is the first line of defense in preventing further complications and a longer hospitalizalion . It is important to understand the anatomic , physiologic components , treatment modalities , and classifications of pelvic fractures in taking better care of the patient and in the education of the patient and family .
