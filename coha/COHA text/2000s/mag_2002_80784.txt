Q : NAME THE one thing at the Olympics that sucks worse than a French figure skating judge . // A : Fourth place . // Finishing fourth at the Olympics is like getting 100,000 shares of Enron or being the next person in line after the free beer runs out . As Mark Twain would say , it 's the difference between lightning and lightning bug . // Win a medal in Salt Lake City , and you 're treated like a returning astronaut . The medal gets hung around your neck by , say , the king of Sweden . You toss flowers to salivating women , kick it with Bob Costas on the NBC set and tingle at the Medals Plaza , where 20,000 people roar every time you doff your beret . The rest of your life is just walking past smiling bouncers into the coolest parties and having the words " Olympic medalist " follow your name . // Fourth place ? Never heard of you . // No medal , no press conference , no check from your country 's Olympic committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medalists get the Waldorf Astoria . Fourth place gets a leaky hotel room in Altoona with gymnastic honeymooners next door . // Fourth place is Polish snowboarder Jagna Marczulajtis , who was racing for a bronze in parallel snowboarding last week when she lost an edge halfway down and fell . Weeping , she moaned , " Fourth place is the worst place on earth . You are so close to being there , you can taste it . " // Fourth place is U.S. bobsled driver Brian Shimer , who has competed in five Olympics and never won a medal . He lost the bronze in 1998 by .02 of a second . Two-hundredths of a second . You can lose that much time to a stubborn snowflake on the track , a wobbly spike on a shoe , the head wind from a butterfly 's burp . " I still think about it today , " said Shimer , who finished ninth in the two-man event on Sunday , " but I 've learned there 's more to life than bobsled. " // Yeah ? Like what ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minuscule .12 of a second out of a bronze at the Sydney Games and sobbing , " Fourth place feels like last .... Maybe some press-on nails would 've made the difference . " // Fourth place is no place . Twentieth place is better . At least 20th place lets you sleep at night . Do you know what .12 of a second does to your REM sleep ? Fourth place is back to your parents ' bagel shop , maybe finishing your degree at Walla Walla Business School . // Remember , in 1994 , when Tonya Harding 's husband hired thugs to put a few runs in Nancy Kerrigan 's hose ? Who can say the madness did n't spring from Kerrigan 's having finished third and Harding fourth at the ' 92 Games ? Now the bronze medalist is a skating diva , married to her agent , the mother of a five-year-old son and a multimillionaire . The fourth-place finisher is a failed wrestling manager who was just evicted for not making rent . // Fourth place is cruel . In 1972 Finnish cross-country skier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's lucky he was n't skiing the biathlon , because Juha might have shot someone  --  possibly Juha. // This year the USOC is paying $25,000 to gold medalists , $15,000 to silver and $10,000 to bronze . Fourth place gets a crummy piece of paper that looks like a certificate an eight-year-old would get for playing on an Elks Club soccer team . It reads , " For your participation and sportsmanship at the XIX Olympic Winter Games . " Says American freestyle skier Jonny Moseley , who finished fourth last week , " It 's like , Congratulations ! You completed the Olympics ! " // All that fourth place gets you is to a doping control station . The IOC tests the first-through fourth-place finishers . That means , you , Mr. Fourth Place , have to wait an hour while the three heroes get their medals and kisses and slobbering press conferences . Then you get to go inside a little room with that giddy threesome  --  all of whom are celebrating the greatest day of their lives , thanks to the fact they finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Maybe fourth place just needs a good p.r . firm . After all , two of the coolest guys in Olympic history , Dan Jansen and Steve Prefontaine , finished fourth . What fourth place really needs is its own medal  --  something symbolic , something that reflects the feeling you get the rest of your life as it hangs around your neck . // Is lead taken ?
