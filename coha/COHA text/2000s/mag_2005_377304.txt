New Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will help open a fresh chapter in the long search for Middle East peace this week when he meets with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh . But as usual , internal Palestinian politics played a key role in getting him there . Abbas agreed to go to Sharm el-Sheikh because he wants to show that he has Egypt 's support in his effort to rein in the militants of Hamas and Islamic Jihad . Shaken by Hamas ' overwhelming victory in last month 's municipal elections in the Gaza Strip , Abbas ' Fatah Party sees Egypt as a powerful ally in the political battle against the group . <P> Many in Fatah are n't happy about Abbas ' trip to Sharm el-Sheikh , fearing it might actually hurt him in his fight against Hamas . " You need to put your own house in order first , " says a Fatah chief . To do that , Abbas must deal with Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei , who refuses to cleanse the Cabinet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior Minister . Referring to the upcoming talks , Qurei told an aide last week , " I expect another Aqaba failure , " likening the summit to one held in Jordan in 2003 . <P> Some Fatah officials are wondering why Egypt is suddenly taking such an interest in Palestinian affairs . The reason , many speculate , may have less to do with optimism over Abbas ' recent election than with growing pressure for Cairo to make sweeping changes in its authoritarian rule . In his State of the Union address , President George W. Bush expressed hope that Egypt , having shown " the way toward peace in the Middle East , can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East . " That repeated , almost word for word , a line Bush used in a 2003 speech . As Bush 's speechwriters try to drive home that message , Egypt may be trying to deflect attention away from it .  --  By Matt Rees and Jamil Hamad                  @ @ @
