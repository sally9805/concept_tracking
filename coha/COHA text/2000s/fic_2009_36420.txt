1994 <p> Kyle , all of twelve years old , hated the suit . <p> He hated everything else about this day , too  --  his Uncle Max 's voice droning on from the driver 's seat of the battered black pickup , the bright sun shining into his eyes , the way the truck was filled with smoke from his mother 's cigarette , the expectant dread that twisted his stomach . But most of all he hated the suit . <p> His mother had bought it for him just yesterday , snatched it off the rack at some discount warehouse and held it up for him , limp and gray , as if it were some dead animal she had shot and dragged home . " For tomorrow , " she said with that same detached smile she had been wearing ever since he came home from school , backpack still on his shoulder , and she told him the news . <p> " I do n't want to wear a suit , " he said . <p> " I bought it big , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it for next year , too . " <p> And now there it was , wrapped around his body like a fist , his first suit . It did n't fit right ; the pants were too long , the shoulders too narrow , the tie choked him . He wondered how anyone could wear such an uncomfortable thing every day . Especially the tie . His father always had one slung around his neck whenever he came for a visit . Navy blue suit , dark thin tie , yellow-toothed smile and shock of white hair . " Hello , boyo , " he 'd say whenever he saw Kyle , giving his hair a quick tousle . <p> " I never liked the son of a bitch , " said Uncle Max . Uncle Max was Kyle 's mother 's older brother . He had come out from the city for the funeral , which was a treat in itself . Not . <p> " Stop it , Max , " said Kyle 's mother . <p> " I 'm just saying . " <p> " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been right all along , have n't I ? " Uncle Max wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . " Where was he anyway when he got it ? " <p> " What , he had someone stashed there , too ? " <p> " Quiet . " <p> " Yeah , yeah . Okay . But we 're better off without him , all of us . What did Laszlo say it was ? " <p> " Heart . " <p> " Figures . Is he saving us a place or something ? " <p> Kyle 's mother did n't answer . She just inhaled from her cigarette and leaned her head against the window . <p> " Let me guess . You was n't even invited . " <p> " Laszlo suggested that it might be best if we did n't come . " <p> " Well , then , " said Uncle Max , " this might be more fun than I thought . " <p> Kyle , wedged in the front seat between his uncle and his mother , craned his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the sky a dark cloud kept pace with the car . Kyle was missing school today , which was good , but he had a game that afternoon , and he 'd probably have to miss that , too , which sucked . And then he had n't cried yet , which only confirmed what he had always believed , that there was something seriously wrong with him . His mother had n't cried either , as far as he could tell . She had her strange smile , like in that painting of that Mona lady , and she was smoking , nonstop , which was a sign of something , but Kyle had seen no tears from her . And Uncle Max certainly did n't seem so cut up about the whole thing . So maybe it was n't such a deal after all . Except in the soft , untrammeled depths of his heart , he knew that it was , knew that it was bigger than everything and that he should be bawling his eyes out and that there was something seriously wrong with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing by gave way to a low stone wall . Beyond the wall were gravestones and small marble crypts like out of Scooby-Doo . The quick change in scenery jolted Kyle back to the unpleasant task at hand . He stuck his thumb into his collar at the front of his neck and yanked it down . It did n't help . <p> Uncle Max turned the truck into the cemetery . There was a chapel off to the right , like one of the crypts , only large enough to inter an army of ghouls . <p> " Showtime , " said Uncle Max as he pulled into one of the remaining spots in the parking lot and killed the engine . <p> A thin crowd of mourners milled somberly at the entrance as the three approached . They walked side by side by side  --  Uncle Max , thick-shouldered and in a loud sport coat ; Kyle 's mother , tall and drawn in a long black dress ; and Kyle , in his ill-fitting gray suit . A few faces turned toward them , and the crowd suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking down a dusty street in a -black-and-white western on TV . Kyle hesitated for a moment , but his mother raised her chin and kept on walking as though she had n't noticed the stares . Kyle hitched his pants and caught up . <p> On the wall of the chapel , behind a sheet of glass and pressed into a black background , was a series of white plastic letters . <p> <br> Continues ...
