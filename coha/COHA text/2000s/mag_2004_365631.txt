Even frat boys can use a little Queer Eye for the Straight Guy . The lifestyle-makeover show recently descended on the Sigma Chi house at the University of North Texas in Denton . While the rest of the Fab Five spruced and styled , interior-design expert Thom Filicia took a study break to talk to TIME 's Jeffrey Ressner about dorm dcor . " People define themselves aesthetically at a very young age , " says Filicia , who spent his college years at Syracuse University . " The idea is to create a space that represents who you are and also something that 's in your price range . " More highlights from their tte -- tte : <P> *WALLS A lot of times , you ca n't paint your dorm room , so a good thing to do is buy a big white stretch canvas or lots of small ones and paint them . That 's a great way to bring color into a drab room . Or picture frames . Framing anything  --  instead of using thumbtacks for posters  --  is going to work , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowboxes to display concert tickets , photos or other things that are important to you . <P> *FLOORS AND FURNITURE You can get a huge sisal rug and then put a smaller , colorful one in the middleand oversize beanbaggy pillows on the floor for hanging out . Stacking boxes for storage can double as coffee tables when you 're sitting on those oversize pillows . Use those oversize pillows as living-room-type seating when friends come over , and if they stay over , they can put them together and use them as a guest bed . <P> *LIGHTING Great lighting is hugely important in a dorm room . Usually there are just fluorescent or bad overhead lights . Lighting is an essential way to change the mood of a room , especially if you can use dimmers . <P> *STORAGE You can put nonessential things in long plastic boxes under the bed . More visible containers can be made of woven materials . Get pieces that are interesting to look at and not just practical . Practical storage pieces are great if you have a basement or a garage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day out , they should be beautiful to look at . The things with the much better look cost about the same as the clear plastic , so why not ? <P> *MAXIMIZING SPACE Shelving is very important , even if it 's those simple shelves you screw into the wall and take home when you leave . Getting things up off the floor in a dorm room is key . You want to get things up high because there 's not a lot of down . There 's only so much square footage in a dorm room , and usually you get half of it . So the more things you can move up , the more room you have on the floor . <P> *PERSONALITY You should walk into a dorm room and really have a good idea of who this person is . In college you have the license to do things you 'll never do again , so have fun with it . If you have a great fishing rod or a snowboard , get brackets and hang it on the wall or from the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great-looking hamper . It 's a place where you know your clothes are . When you come home , drop your clothes in it , and if you do n't have any clean clothes , you know where to go get something to wear again . It 's not about changing people . It 's about living the way you live , only living better .
