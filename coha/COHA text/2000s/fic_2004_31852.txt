Kiss of Death Titus decided that if there were a button to press that would cause his sister to reincarnate as a cockroach , he would push it without a moment 's hesitation . He stood outside her bedroom door , seething , as he read the notice taped to the oak paneling : Pandora 's Room entry is absolutely forbidden to any of the following : brothers dweebs possessors of smelly pits &; dog 's breath one-celled amoebas with memory of goldfish smug , rich jerks the terminally plug-ugly the criminally insane and especially the vertically challenged over 12 yrs . Titus , all of the above describe you , so bog off . Yours Cordially , Pandora Strega-Borgia Pandora 's Room StregaSchloss Argyll Scotland United Kingdom Europe Western Hemisphere Earth The Universe The Galaxy " Just because I 'm about to inherit all Grandfather Borgia 's money and you 're broke does n't mean you have to be so aggressive . " Titus 's voice bounced off the door and down the landing , but brought no answering response from within . He pressed his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people just ca n't handle other people 's good fortune , can they , Pandora ? " Over his head , dangling from the cornice , Pandora 's pet tarantula , Tarantella , gaveout an exasperated " Tchhhh . " Titus looked up and shuddered . There was something about the scuttling nature of spiders that revolted him . This one in particular , with her swollen abdomen , gave him nightmares . Titus loathed the entire spider race with a deep and abiding passion . Their gross hairiness , their appetite for flies , their -- The tarantula grinned widely , as if reading his thoughts . " Like it ? " she inquired , puckering up her lipsticked mouth parts into a pout . " It 's a new one . Now , what 's it called . . . ? " Tarantella rummaged under her abdomen with one hairy leg and produced a minuscule lipstick . " Let me see . . . ' Blood-Lust . ' Mmm-hmm . Come on , Titus , I know you find me irresistible , give us a kiss . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trembling , he burst through the kitchen door and was immediately assailed by a stench that defied description . The beasts were already at breakfast and , judging by the state of the kitchen , had been eating for several hours . Sprawled across the kitchen table , Ffup , the teenage dragon , had her vast head buried in her talons . " Do n't say it , " she warned , gazing down at Titus with her vast golden eyes . " Just do n't say it , right ? I 've been up all night with that wee horror , and now he sits there , wolfs down forty-eight Miserablios , three boxes of Ricey Krispettes , and then does a major dump , downloading the lot into his pants . I tell you , pal , I 'm not cut out for this motherhood stuff . I hate changing diapers , and . . . " The dragon paused , peered under her baby 's high chair , and whimpered , " Yup , just as I thought , it 's a shovel job . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Ffup and patting her offending infant on his scaly little head . " Phwoarr , Nestor , you stink , do n't you ? " The baby gazed up at Titus and grinned gummily , clapping his tiny wings above his head and lashing his snake-like tail back and forth by way of greeting . This had the unfortunate consequence of launching most of the contents of his overloaded diaper into orbit . " Stop . Stop . STOP ! " wailed Ffup . " Oh , yeurrrch . I ca n't handle this . . . . Knot ! knot ? Come on , help me out here . " Emerging from the pantry with a sheepish grin , Knot the yeti shuffled across the kitchen to stare hopefully at his fellow beasts . The yeti 's perpetually unsanitary fur was clotted with fetid lumps of food that had somehow failed to make the journey to his mouth . He wrinkled up his fur in the general area of his nose , sniffed deeply in sincerest appreciation of the odors in the kitchen , and sighed in happy anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " muttered Ffup , burying her nostrils in a coffee cup . " Freshly laid , still warm . . . " " Give me strength , " gagged Titus , turning his back on this revolting inter-beast exchange . " Mmm-yummy , " observed Knot , dipping an experimental paw in the puddle under Nestor 's high chair . Titus moaned softly and closed his eyes . Knot sniffed , unrolled his lengthy spotted tongue , and sampled a little morsel . " Naww , " he pronounced , at length . " Bit overripe , that one . Nope . Do n't fancy it much . " " Do n't be so picky , " said Ffup . " Be a gent . Help me out . Just close your eyes and think of Gorgonzola . Pleeeeease ? " Knot wiped his paw on his tummy and scratched his armpit thoughtfully . " If you do n't mind , I 'll pass , " he mumbled , clearly uncomfortable at the prospect of letting Ffup down . " I 'm not really too hungry right this minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arriving in the kitchen by way of the door to the herb garden . " Phwoarr . Urghhh . What 's that stench ? " " Here we go again , " sighed Ffup , glaring at her baby son . " See what you 've done ? " " ' Morning , all . " Pandora kicked off her rubber boots and came over to warm herself beside Titus at the range . " Are we all pretending that there is n't a vast pile of dragon poo on the floor over there , or is someone going to clean it up ? " " Ffup is , " said Titus . " Are n't you , Ffup ? " " What ? And ruin my manicured talons ? " squeaked the dragon . " You ca n't be serious . These took me ages . " Hoping for female sympathy , she extended one paw for Pandora 's inspection . Each of her seven talons was painted a lurid sugar-pink . " Pretty , are n't they ? " Ffup smirked , examining her paw with satisfaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch the light . Mrs. Flora McLachlan , nanny to Titus and Pandora , entered the kitchen with their baby sister , Damp , in her arms . Smelling something truly awful and assuming that it was about to be her breakfast , the little girl buried her face in the nanny 's shoulder and gave a little moan . " Good heavens , is that the time ? " Mrs. McLachlan peered at the mantelpiece clock in dismay . " My bedside clock is n't keeping very good time , and the alarm did n't go off . " Then , as she became aware of the odor in the kitchen , she added , " Ffup , dear , I 'm sure you 're aware that Nestor needs a diaper change . D' you think you could stop admiring your manicure , stir your stumps , and do it before your mistress comes downstairs for breakfast ? " From the Trade Paperback edition .
