HOW OLD IS ... THE UNIVERSE EARTH 'S OLDEST ROCK J. DOE MESOZOIC FOSSILS THE SHROUD OF TURIN MODERN HUMANS ANCIENT POTTERY COMPLEX ANIMAL LIFE THIS BABY ? A SABER  --  TOOTHED CAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS MAMMALS THE GRAND CANYON AUSTRALIA 'S MEGAFAUNA STONEHENGE THE M100 GALAXY THIS BABY ? 0.000 0000000 0084 ( about a trillionth ) the age of the universe . We may not measure up to time 's vast scale-but we are measuring it . Whenever I feel prematurely old and creaky , I look at a rock that sits on a corner of my desk . It is a dark gray hunk of granite-like rock called gneiss , flecked with bits of feldspar . I picked it up off the ground along the Acasta River in Canada 's Northwest Territories , and it 's pretty much like any other piece of gneiss except for one thing : It comes from a formation that dates back more than four billion years-the oldest rock yet found on Earth . Its age is so vast that it 's almost impossible to comprehend . From our planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , even as continents have been torn apart and rearranged . If you think of a year as equaling one yard of twine , you 'd need enough twine to stretch between the Earth and the moon more than four and a half times to equal the age of the Acasta rock . How can we possibly know this ? Nature does n't print birth certificates or hammer a year on its creations as if they were coins . Scientists have learned to tell the age of bones , rocks , planets , and stars by using clocks that tick away in the very atoms that form them . And with these natural chronometers  --  which they can read with staggering resolution - they can understand the forces that have shaped the continents , life itself , human civilization , the galaxy . No longer can human history match the scale of natural history . If the age of the universe , about 13 billion years , were equal to one summer day , then the past 100,000 years-which saw the rise of modern humans , the dawn of agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firefly at sunset . Scientists can choose among different kinds of natural clocks depending on the scale of time they work with . For the period reaching back 40,000 years or so , they rely on radioactive carbon . By measuring the amount of radioactive carbon in a sample from something that was once alive , they can determine how long it has been dead . For example , archaeologists know that one of the oldest parts of Stonehenge , a ditch that encircles the famous stones , was dug with antlers found at the site . By measuring the carbon in those antlers , they have determined that the digging took place 5,000 years ago . Where does radioactive carbon come from ? All atoms-carbon atoms and atoms of every other element-contain subatomic particles in their nuclei , including positively charged protons and ( except for hydrogen ) neutrally charged neutrons . Generally atoms of the same element have the same number of protons and neutrons . Carbon , for example , usually has six protons and six neutrons , which added together give this form of carbon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element have different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei , the atoms are called isotopes . Carbon 12 is one carbon isotope ; another is carbon 14 , which has eight neutrons and is radioactive . Carbon 14 is formed when particles from space slam into nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere . Radioactive isotopes decay at a predictable rate , and carbon 14 is no exception . If you bottled up a pound of it , half the bottle would decay in 5,730 years . After another 5,730 years , only a quarter of it would be left . ( Physicists call these 5,730-year periods the half-life of carbon 14 . ) Plants and animals that are alive and absorbing carbon dioxide from the air have constant levels of both carbon 12 and carbon 14 . But as soon as they die , the supply of carbon 14 , which decays back to nitrogen 14 at a known rate , begins to dwindle . By comparing the carbon 14 level to the total amount of carbon in the material , scientists can calculate how long ago the plant or animal died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 left in them that scientists have had to search for other ways to determine their age . A geologist named Gifford Miller from the University of Colorado showed me around a site at Lake Victoria in southern Australia where he used two new dating techniques to get around the limits of carbon 14 . Lake Victoria is bounded by an enormous crescent of high dunes , piled up over tens of thousands of years . Under swarms of pink  --  breasted galah cockatoos , Miller and I hiked the rippled sands . Signs of Australia 's history , unburied by scouring winds , were everywhere . We saw rusted shell casings left from Royal Australian Air Force training runs in the 1940s . From deeper layers of the dunes-and farther back in time-came piles of mussel shells that had been collected from the lake by Aborigines . Spearpoints lay nearby along with the bones of kangaroo and emu the Aborigines hunted . Descending into a gully , we walked down toward the water and further back through time . " Here is the extinction layer , I think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it paleontologists have found the skeletons of hippo-size marsupials , kangaroos ten feet tall , marsupial lions-a collection of giants . There 's a debate in Australia over how those giants became extinct . Did humans wipe them out , or was it a climate change ? The first step in solving the mystery is to decipher the age of the fossils , but there 's not enough carbon 14 left in them to measure their age accurately . So Miller has become a connoisseur of new clocks . " There it is . Genyornis , " he said , picking up a fragment the size of his fingernail . Genyornis is the name of one of the vanished monsters : a 400-pound flightless bird . Miller held a piece of an eggshell from one of them-the color of putty , with small dimples on its surface . He has amassed a collection of thousands of similar shell fragments from many sites in southeastern Australia . It turns out they 're everywhere , and once you know what to look for , it 's easy to spot them against the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who 'd think you could just go around picking up eggshells ? " Miller and his colleagues have determined the age of Genyornis shells with two kinds of clocks . The first measures age by determining how long it has been since a mineral-such as quartz in the sand where the shells are buried-was exposed to sunlight . Radioactive atoms surrounding and inside such buried quartz release particles that can knock electrons out of their normal positions , orbiting the nucleus in an atom . The released electrons sometimes get stuck in a defect in the crystal structure of the quartz . These crystal traps gradually fill up with electrons in a regular , clocklike way . If you know the rate of the trapping and can count the trapped electrons , you can figure out how long it 's been since the quartz saw the light of day-a method called optically stimulated luminescence . Miller 's challenge was to find shells in sand containing quartz that had not been exposed to light since the moment it was first buried . If the sand was exposed at any point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break out and return to their original places . In only a few seconds sunlight can clear out all the trapped electrons in a grain of quartz , setting the clock back to zero . To date quartz crystals with trapped electrons , he enlisted an expert in this kind of dating , Nigel A. Spooner , a physicist from the Australian National University . Spooner hammered hollow stainless steel cylinders into the sand that held Genyornis shells . He quickly capped the cylinders , wrapped them in black plastic , and brought them to his lab . There , under dim red darkroom lights , he put grains of quartz in a machine that fired a beam of photons at them , releasing the trapped electrons . As the electrons settled back into their atoms they shed some energy as light . By measuring that light , Spooner could count the electrons that had been trapped and figure out the age of the shells . Miller himself perfected another method of dating the shells by examining the proteins preserved within them-amino acid racemization . The building blocks of proteins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed form . For reasons still unknown , nature overwhelmingly prefers left-handed amino acids . Once an amino acid is formed , however , it can spontaneously flip over to become right-handed . The rate at which amino acids flip is n't as regular as radioactive decay because it depends on temperature : Heat speeds up the reaction and cold slows it down . But Miller has been able to account for these variables by estimating climate changes in Australia over the past 100,000 years . Both clocks point to the same age for the Genyornis shells : The bird became extinct about 50,000 years ago . Miller thinks his result rules out environmental causes for the extinction . Climatic records from his sites show that 50,000 years ago water , and therefore vegetation , was abundant . Australian scientists have found a clue to the truth a hundred miles away on the dunes surrounding Lake Mungo , where they have counted trapped electrons to date a human skeleton and quartz from surrounding sediments back to 60,000 years-the oldest signs of humanity in Australia . The presence of humans at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable for survival-implies that humans were the agents of Genyornis 's destruction . " If humans had n't been there , the extinction would not have happened , " says Miller . " The real struggle is to say how people did it . " He suggests that by hunting prey and altering their habitat by fire , humans wiped out the giant fauna , and did so in a geologic blink of an eye . The ages that Miller tosses around in conversation-50,000 years , 60,000-would have been absurd to a European in 1700 . Scholars had painstakingly studied the chronology of the Bible to calculate how much time had passed since the days of Eden , adding up the ages of Adam and his descendants . In the 1650s Archbishop James Ussher came up with the date that would become the standard for over 200 years : God created the Earth in 4004 B.C.-on October 22 , to be precise . Scientists began to dismantle the idea of a young Earth in the late 1700s , when they discovered that the planet 's rocks are organized into a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can still see at work today : the steady grinding down of mountains and the gentle rain of sediment to the bottom of rivers . But these forces work slowly , and for them to have actually created today 's landscapes , the Earth would have to be billions of years old . It would take until the 20th century for scientists to determine exactly how old the Earth is . Shortly after physicists discovered radioactivity and realized it could be used to fix dates to rocks , they realized they could also use it to find the age of the planet itself . Some of Earth 's radioactive atoms were blasted out of neighboring stars in supernova explosions . They were swept up in a primordial disk revolving around the young sun and eventually helped form the solar system , coalescing into planets , comets , and meteoroids . Because they 've been with Earth from the start , these radioactive atoms can tell us how old the planet is . Some of them are uranium isotopes that decay into lead : uranium 235 into lead 207 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into lead 206 , with a half-life of 4.47 billion years . In the 1950s Clair Patterson , an American geochemist , compared the amounts of uranium and lead in rocks from Earth and in meteorites that had struck Earth . All his samples pointed back to a common origin at the dawn of the solar system . The age of the Earth , Patterson calculated , was 4.55 billion years . As the Earth cooled down and developed a crust , the first rocks formed-the Canadian Acasta rock that sits on my desk among them . Discovering the age of the earliest rocks turns out to be more difficult than calculating the age of the Earth itself . Once a rock forms , its uranium starts slowly turning to lead-but if underground water adds lead or uranium ( or takes them away ) , researchers will end up with the wrong age . Fortunately , nature has created the perfect rock clock for geologists . When magma cools , rugged little crystals known as zircons form . Made of zirconium , silicon , and oxygen , zircons also lock a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zircon shuts out just about any contaminant and can survive for billions of years . Over those billions of years , the trapped uranium steadily decays to lead . " Zircons are God 's gift to geochemistry , " says Ian Williams of the Australian National University . They can survive even after the rock where they originally formed erodes away . In Western Australia geologists have found a zircon crystal 4.4 billion years old trapped inside a rock that dates back only 3.1 billion years . Zircons allow scientists to put dates on the history of the Earth , but zircons are not easy to find . I learned just how difficult and intense the search can be as I stood one chilly May morning at the harbor at Admiral 's Beach on the southeast coast of Newfoundland . There on the beach was a 15-foot wooden boat that would carry me and three scientists-Sam Bowring , a geologist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Paul Myrow , a geologist from Colorado College , and Ed Landing , the state paleontologist from the New York State Museum-to deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way along the west side of the island toward its southern end , motoring past merciless sea cliffs that exploded the waves into spray . As we lurched through the water , Landing identified the layers of rock exposed on the cliffs . They were from the late Precambrian , ranging roughly from 600 to 550 million years old . It was around that time that animal life proliferated . The first distinct chemical signs of life that scientists have detected on Earth are actually much older than that-found in Greenland in the planet 's oldest sedimentary rock . We know their age because the rock is enclosed in slightly younger zircon-bearing rock that indicates a date of 3.9 billion years . But for well over 3 billion years after those first imprints , life left only microscopic marks in the fossil record . Then , not long before the Cambrian , strange multicellular fossils appear-giant fronds , ornamented disks , and other oddities collectively known as Ediacaran . Paleontologists are n't sure which , if any , of these creatures are the forerunners of later animals . What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossils of most of the major groups of animals turn up . By dating fossil-bearing rocks from around the world , Bowring and his colleagues have shown that the burst of evolution known as the Cambrian explosion began around 530 million years ago . Short of the origin of life itself , that episode represents evolution 's supreme scientific challenge . Bowring was on Great Colinet Island to test a theory championed in 1998 by Paul Hoffman , a geologist from Harvard , about what triggered the Cambrian explosion . The theory suggests that evolution was given a hard push when the planet fell into an ice age that got out of control . Glaciers kept growing until they covered the entire Earth , and life died back to almost nothing . After a few million years volcanic eruptions had released enough carbon dioxide to create a greenhouse effect that raised the planet 's temperature . The glaciers melted , and the rising ocean created vast shallow seas that life could recolonize , giving evolution a tremendous jolt . This " snowball Earth , " as Hoffinan and others call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did exist , it should have left its mark on Great Colinet Island . " This is one of the few places in the world where you can find glacial deposits that you could hope to date , because they 're interlayered with volcanic rocks , " Myrow explained . Using the zircons in the volcanic rocks , the geologists were hoping to bracket the ice age-to find ash layers as close to the bottom and the top of the glacier-delivered rocks as possible . This could possibly tell them not just how old the ice age is but also how long it lasted . We split up to hunt for zircons . I went with Myrow and Bowring . We climbed to the flat grassy top of the island . We hiked through bogs , past nests of flecked gull eggs , over mats of dwarf spruce trees . The struggle was worth it . Scrambling down among boulders battered by waves , Myrow spotted two layers of good volcanic rock , one of them 6 meters below the bottom of the glacial deposits and one of them 1.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ash , " he shouted . Bowring pointed to the rocks he wanted , and the two of them hammered away , with water pouring down the cliff onto their heads . Bowring stuffed the samples into canvas bags and helped me load some of them into my backpack . The three of us started the long march back to the boat , to put the zircons on a plane , get them back to Bowring 's lab in Massachusetts , put dates on them , and try to figure out if it was " snowball Earth " that triggered the Cambrian explosion . Blair Hedges , a biologist at Pennsylvania State University , is investigating the origins of animals with a different kind of clock . I stood with him in front of a bank of humming freezers while he inspected an ice  --  encrusted tray of little tubes , each filled with tissue . Hedges is creating a refrigerated zoo , collecting tissues from animals scattered among the 35 major taxonomic groups known as phyla . In his trays he had tissue from scorpions , centipedes , peanut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got about threequarters of all the phyla right here , " he said . Those cells contain clocks of their own that can tell time for hundreds of millions of years . From generation to generation certain genes of a species mutate at relatively steady rates . If you compare the genes of two species , say humans and chimpanzees-and you know the rates at which their genes have been mutating-you can estimate how long it has been since their ancestors diverged from a common ancestor . This kind of molecular clock , as it 's known , has come into its own in the past ten years . In 1996 Hedges caused a stir by using molecular clocks to date the dawn of mammals . When paleontologists look at the record of mammal fossils , they see a burst of diversity just after dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago . It was this burst , they theorize , that produced most of the orders alive today-from hoofed mammals to bats to us primates . But when Hedges and his colleagues look beyond the fossil records at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 100 million years . Hedges is now investigating what molecular clocks have to say about the Cambrian explosion , which researchers such as Sam Bowring have determined took place 530 to 520 million years ago . Again , Hedges 's results are far different from what fossil records show . He and his colleagues have compared genes from three animal phyla , and their molecular clocks point to an origin over a billion years ago-once more a doubling of evolutionary history . The conflict between fossils and genes will take a long time to sort out . Critics of molecular clocks suspect that evolution can make them speed up or slow down . But Hedges counters that he and his colleagues can guard against this sort of variability , and when they do , their dates still hold up . As for the lack of fossils to support his dates , Hedges argues that the earliest forms did n't leave fossils behind , or at least any that have yet been discovered . Only around the start of the Cambrian did they get big enough for us to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life but to the history of the universe itself . Clocks that pin down the formation of the solar system can be found in meteorites that have fallen to Earth after wandering around the sun for billions of years . But for more ancient time telling , scientists can not use any clock to be found on Earth . They have to look at the sky . The sky was cloudy on the evening I met George Djorgovski , an astronomer from Caltech working in Hawaii , and rain was falling as we walked quickly across a dark lawn . " Can you believe we can look at stars in this weather ? " he asked . We entered a small building and slipped into a room filled with bright fluorescent light and eight giant computer screens . Even if the sky was clear , we could n't have seen the stars through the drawn blinds . Djorgovski sat in front of three computer screens pushed next to each other . The computers are hooked up to data cables that run 48 miles from this room to the 13,800-foot  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopes in the world , at the W. M. Keck Observatory . As the sun set , Djorgovski sent coordinates to technicians at the top of Mauna Kea , and the telescope he was using swung across the sky . A disembodied voice from one of the computers in the room said , " Exposure complete , " and a white field filled with black spots appeared . One giant blob dominated the center of the picture-a ferociously bright object known as a quasar , with the intensity of trillions of suns . " That 's our guy , " said Djorgovski . He touched the image of the quasar with one finger . " Just think , " he said . " As the Earth formed , the light from this had already traveled two-thirds of its way here . " Quasars and galaxies are hurtling away from us as the universe expands . As they speed off , the light they emit lowers in frequency and shifts toward the red end of the spectrum  --  much as a train whistle drops in pitch as it passes by . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus the rate at which the galaxies are flying apart-it 's possible to figure how long it has been since they were all contained together in one point of infinite density at the moment of the creation of the cosmos . In other words , astronomers can use that rate along with other cosmological data to tell how old the universe is . Today 's estimate for the expansion rate indicates that the universe is 13 billion years old . Knowing the age of the universe is as important to astronomers as knowing the age of the Earth is to geologists . It lets them start putting together its history . How , for example , did the universe get from a uniform big bang to the state it 's in today , with galaxies separated by vast stretches of relatively empty space ? Did giant clusters of matter break down into galaxies , or did groups of stars join together ? Djorgovski 's quasar has a redshift that indicates it formed less than a billion years after the universe began . " What we 're after is the first galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by evidence that these youngest galaxies are already rich with elements like carbon and oxygen-elements that can only be produced in mature stars . " We find galaxies in a good state of assembly after only a few hundred million years . How did they form so quickly ? " says Djorgovski . Well into the 21st century , astronomers will be wrestling with the puzzle of how so many galaxies evolved so fast after the dawn of the universe . By ten o'clock Djorgovski was waiting for the next observation . Sitting there with him , looking at the signs of young galaxies , I thought about what it means for something to be old . If you are 12 years old , or 50 , or 90 , that only means that a certain network of atoms has come together for that time . Many of the individual atoms that make up that network will stay in your body only a short time before being replaced by new ones . And all of those atoms have been wandering through the air and ground and ocean for billions of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other atoms , which in turn reach back to the dawn of galaxies , to the first second of the universe when all matter came into being . " Hey , George , how 's your little girl ? " asked Teresa Chelminiak , an observatory assistant working at the computer next to Djorgovski . " Let me show you , " Djorgovski said . With one kick , he propelled his chair over to another screen . " Here 's the other thing these machines are good for , " he said . He got on the Web and pulled up his home page . Slowly , strip by strip , the spectrum of a baby galaxy was hidden behind a photograph of Djorgovski 's own baby . She was uncomplicated in her happiness . Her carbon 14 had no anomaly . Her redshift was zero . Once again , the clock was reset . MORE ON OUR WEBSITE Find resources and field notes from the author and photographer at **31;0;TOOLONG . Sidebar <p>                @ @ @ @ @
