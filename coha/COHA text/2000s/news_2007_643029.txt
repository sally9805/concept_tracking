<p> IN our celebrity-studded world , where we make a cult of genius and individual achievement , the mind rebels at the notion that geography trumps personality . Yet the inescapable lesson of the iPod , Google , eBay , Netflix and Silicon Valley in general is that where you live often trumps who you are . <p> Just ask Sim Wong Hoo . About seven years ago , I met Mr. Sim in Singapore , where he was born and was then living . He talked about the rising creativity of Singaporeans and with a flourish , as if to dramatically make his point , he pulled out a prototype of a hand-held music player that he insisted would replace Sony 's famous Walkman . <p> Mr. Sim 's device was breathtaking , possessing all the elements of what we now know as the M player . Yet today , a Silicon Valley icon , Apple , dominates the market for M players with the iPod . In recognition of its emergence as a music powerhouse , last month Apple dropped the word " computer " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I visited the thriving code-writing communities in Tallinn , Estonia ; Reykjavik , Iceland ; and Helsinki , Finland , three Nordic cities that were being transformed by advances in cellphones , mobile computing and the Internet . Their tight-knit network of engineers seemed poised to create the tools required to make good on a much-hyped prediction : the death of distance . After all , if necessity is the mother of invention , no one had more need than the hardy Estonians , Icelanders and Finns , living on the frozen edge of Europe , when it came to killing distance as a barrier . <p> Yet these Nordic innovators were blindsided by two Silicon Valley engineers whose tools we experience whenever we " Google " the Web . Their company , Google Inc. , posted a quarterly profit of $1 billion on Jan. 31 . <p> Google 's astonishing rise and Apple 's reinvention are reminders that , when it comes to great ideas , location is crucial . " Face-to-face is still very important for exchange of ideas , and nowhere is this exchange more valuable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professor in the Graduate School of Business at Stanford who is known for studying the economics of ideas . <p> In short , " geography matters , " Professor Romer said . Give birth to an information-technology idea in Silicon Valley and the chances of success seem vastly higher than when it is done in another ZIP code . <p> No wonder venture capitalists , who finance bright ideas , remain obsessed with finding the next big thing in the 50-mile corridor between San Jose and San Francisco . About one-quarter of all venture investment in the United States goes to Silicon Valley enterprises . And , according to a new report from Joint Venture : Silicon Valley Network , a regional business group , the percentage has risen , to 27 percent in 2005 from 21 percent in 2000 . <p> Many times in the past , pundits have declared an end to Silicon Valley 's hegemony , and even today there are prognosticators who see growing threats from innovation centers in India and China . Certainly , great technology ideas can come from anywhere , but they keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing returns and first-mover advantage . <p> These twin principles , debated in head-scratching terms by professional economists , essentially explain why Intel maintains a lead in high-performance chips , why Apple sustains a large lead in music players and why Google 's search engine remains a crowd pleaser . <p> On a gut level , we all can understand how these two factors work . Who would n't want to play for a perennial contender ? For the same reason that Andy Pettitte signs with the Yankees , the best and the brightest technologists from around the world make their way to northern California . <p> " All that venture capital attracts a lot of ideas  --  and the people who are having those ideas , " said Stephen B. Adams , an assistant professor of management at the Franklin P. Perdue School of Business at Salisbury University in Maryland who has studied the rise of Silicon Valley . <p> Newcomers plug into an existing network of seasoned pros that " is n't matched anywhere else in the world , " says AnnaLee Saxenian , dean of the School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of " Regional Advantage , " a book about the competitive edge held by tech centers like Silicon Valley and the Route 128 suburbs near Boston . " That allows people to recombine technical ideas much more quickly here than anywhere else , " Professor Saxenian added . <p> " In terms of creativity , the Valley remains as far ahead of the rest of the world as ever , " she said . " People in the Valley generate new ideas and test them much more quickly than anywhere else . They are n't a super race ; it 's their environment . " <p> Silicon Valley is not invincible . The logic of increasing returns and the first-mover advantage can be overdrawn . Other clusters in the United States and around the world will commercialize great ideas , and the Valley will endure down cycles again , as it has in the past . Remember how the Japanese conquered memory-chip manufacturing in the 1980s , until then a staple of the Valley 's business ? And , of course , the dot-com bust of five years ago remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure . <p> Americans naturally harbor many fears about losing their edge , especially with the nation mired in war , the dollar 's value sliding and the health care system strained . Rivals , notably in India and China , see Silicon Valley 's pre-eminent position as a prize that they will inevitably take . Yet they face an elusive foe . Every time Silicon Valley recovers from failure , it seems to grow more durable , almost in the same way a person becomes " immune " to a disease after a brush with it . <p> Fifty years ago , chips were the engine of Silicon Valley . In the late 1970s came the personal computer and data-storage drives , then software , and more recently the dynamic vortex of the Web , new media and online commerce . ( EBay , Netflix and , of course , Google and Yahoo are among the names that come to mind . ) <p> These serial renewals are a marvel . <p> SIR PETER HALL , the British scholar of urban clusters , asks in " Cities in Civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes a particular city , at a particular time , suddenly become immensely creative , exceptionally innovative ? Why should this spirit flower for a few years , generally a decade or two at most , and then disappear as suddenly as it came ? " <p> Sir Peter 's words highlight an enduring human mystery . In the case of Silicon Valley , the world rightly waits for the flame of creativity to burn out . That 's fair enough . To each , a season ( or maybe a few ) . Living long and large , Silicon Valley surely will wither like a dead flower someday . My advice , though , is : Do n't hold your breath. ##
