1 : FORCE FIELDS // I. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible , he is almost certainly right . When he states that something is impossible , he is very probably wrong . // II . The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible . // III . Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . // - ARTHUR C. CLARKE 'S THREE LAWS // " Shields up ! " // In countless Star Trek episodes this is the first order that Captain Kirk barks out to the crew , raising the force fields to protect the starship Enterprise against enemy fire . // So vital are force fields in Star Trek that the tide of the battle can be measured by how the force field is holding up . Whenever power is drained from the force fields , the Enterprise suffers more and more damaging blows to its hull , until finally surrender is inevitable . // So what is a force field ? In science fiction it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to deflect lasers and rockets alike . At first glance a force field looks so easy that its creation as a battlefield shield seems imminent . One expects that any day some enterprising inventor will announce the discovery of a defensive force field . But the truth is far more complicated . // In the same way that Edison 's lightbulb revolutionized modern civilization , a force field could profoundly affect every aspect of our lives . The military could use force fields to become invulnerable , creating an impenetrable shield against enemy missiles and bullets . Bridges , superhighways , and roads could in theory be built by simply pressing a button . Entire cities could sprout instantly in the desert , with skyscrapers made entirely of force fields . Force fields erected over cities could enable their inhabitants to modify the effects of their weather-high winds , blizzards , tornados-at will . Cities could be built under the oceans within the safe canopy of a force field . Glass , steel , and mortar could be entirely replaced . // Yet oddly enough a force field is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory . In fact , some physicists believe it might actually be impossible , without modifying its properties . // Michael Faraday // The concept of force fields originates from the work of the great nineteenth-century British scientist Michael Faraday . // Faraday was born to working-class parents ( his father was a blacksmith ) and eked out a meager existence as an apprentice bookbinder in the early 1800s . The young Faraday was fascinated by the enormous breakthroughs in uncovering the mysterious properties of two new forces : electricity and magnetism . Faraday devoured all he could concerning these topics and attended lectures by Professor Humphrey Davy of the Royal Institution in London . // One day Professor Davy severely damaged his eyes in a chemical accident and hired Faraday to be his secretary . Faraday slowly began to win the confidence of the scientists at the Royal Institution and was allowed to conduct important experiments of his own , although he was often slighted . Over the years Professor Davy grew increasingly jealous of the brilliance shown by his young assistant , who was a rising star in experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davy died in 1829 Faraday was free to make a series of stunning breakthroughs that led to the creation of generators that would energize entire cities and change the course of world civilization . // The key to Faraday 's greatest discoveries was his " force fields . " If one places iron filings over a magnet , one finds that the iron filings create a spiderweb-like pattern that fills up all of space . These are Faraday 's lines of force , which graphically describe how the force fields of electricity and magnetism permeate space . If one graphs the magnetic fields of the Earth , for example , one finds that the lines emanate from the north polar region and then fall back to the Earth in the south polar region . Similarly , if one were to graph the electric field lines of a lightning rod in a thunderstorm , one would find that the lines of force concentrate at the tip of the lightning rod . Empty space , to Faraday , was not empty at all , but was filled with lines of force that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty-stricken youth , he was illiterate in mathematics , and as a consequence his notebooks are full not of equations but of hand-drawn diagrams of these lines of force . Ironically , his lack of mathematical training led him to create the beautiful diagrams of lines of force that now can be found in any physics textbook . In science a physical picture is often more important than the mathematics used to describe it. ) // Historians have speculated on how Faraday was led to his discovery of force fields , one of the most important concepts in all of science . In fact , the sum total of all modern physics is written in the language of Faraday 's fields . In 1831 , he made the key breakthrough regarding force fields that changed civilization forever . One day , he was moving a child 's magnet over a coil of wire and he noticed that he was able to generate an electric current in the wire , without ever touching it . This meant that a magnet 's invisible field could push electrons in a wire across empty space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , " which were previously thought to be useless , idle doodlings , were real , material forces that could move objects and generate power . Today the light that you are using to read this page is probably energized by Faraday 's discovery about electromagnetism . A spinning magnet creates a force field that pushes the electrons in a wire , causing them to move in an electrical current . This electricity in the wire can then be used to light up a lightbulb . This same principle is used to generate electricity to power the cities of the world . Water flowing across a dam , for example , causes a huge magnet in a turbine to spin , which then pushes the electrons in a wire , forming an electric current that is sent across high-voltage wires into our homes . // In other words , the force fields of Michael Faraday are the forces that drive modern civilization , from electric bulldozers to today 's computers , Internet , and iPods. // Faraday 's force fields have been an inspiration for physicists for a century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote his theory of gravity in terms of force fields . I , too , was inspired by Faraday 's work . Years ago I successfully wrote the theory of strings in terms of the force fields of Faraday , thereby founding string field theory . In physics when someone says , " He thinks like a line of force , " it is meant as a great compliment . // The Four Forces // Over the last two thousand years one of the crowning achievements of physics has been the isolation and identification of the four forces that rule the universe . All of them can be described in the language of fields introduced by Faraday . Unfortunately , however , none of them has quite the properties of the force fields described in most science fiction . These forces are // 1 . Gravity , the silent force that keeps our feet on the ground , prevents the Earth and the stars from disintegrating , and holds the solar system and galaxy together . Without gravity , we would be flung off the Earth into space at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The problem is that gravity has precisely the opposite properties of a force field found in science fiction . Gravity is attractive , not repulsive ; is extremely weak , relatively speaking ; and works over enormous , astronomical distances . In other words , it is almost the opposite of the flat , thin , impenetrable barrier that one reads about in science fiction or one sees in science fiction movies . For example , it takes the entire planet Earth to attract a feather to the floor , but we can counteract Earth 's gravity by lifting the feather with a finger . The action of our finger can counteract the gravity of an entire planet that weighs over six trillion trillion kilograms. // 2 . Electromagnetism ( EM ) , the force that lights up our cities . Lasers , radio , TV , modern electronics , computers , the Internet , electricity , magnetism-all are consequences of the electromagnetic force . It is perhaps the most useful force ever harnessed by humans . Unlike gravity , it can be both attractive and repulsive . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force field . First , it can be easily neutralized . Plastics and other insulators , for example , can easily penetrate a powerful electric or magnetic field . A piece of plastic thrown in a magnetic field would pass right through . Second , electromagnetism acts over large distances and can not easily be focused onto a plane . The laws of the EM force are described by James Clerk Maxwell 's equations , and these equations do not seem to admit force fields as solutions . // 3 &amp; 4 . The weak and strong nuclear forces . The weak force is the force of radioactive decay . It is the force that heats up the center of the Earth , which is radioactive . It is the force behind volcanoes , earthquakes , and continental drift . The strong force holds the nucleus of the atom together . The energy of the sun and the stars originates from the nuclear force , which is responsible for lighting up the universe . The problem is that the nuclear force is a short-range force , acting mainly over the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the properties of nuclei , it is extremely hard to manipulate . At present the only ways we have of manipulating this force are to blow subatomic particles apart in atom smashers or to detonate atomic bombs . // Although the force fields used in science fiction may not conform to the known laws of physics , there are still loopholes that might make the creation of such a force field possible . First , there may be a fifth force , still unseen in the laboratory . Such a force might , for example , work over a distance of only a few inches to feet , rather than over astronomical distances . ( Initial attempts to measure the presence of such a fifth force , however , have yielded negative results. ) // Second , it may be possible to use a plasma to mimic some of the properties of a force field . A plasma is the " fourth state of matter . " Solids , liquids , and gases make up the three familiar states of matter , but the most common form of matter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the atoms of a plasma are ripped apart , with electrons torn off the atom , the atoms are electrically charged and can be easily manipulated by electric and magnetic fields . // Plasmas are the most plentiful form of visible matter in the universe , making up the sun , the stars , and interstellar gas . Plasmas are not familiar to us because they are only rarely found on the Earth , but we can see them in the form of lightning bolts , the sun , and the interior of your plasma TV. // Plasma Windows // As noted above , if a gas is heated to a high enough temperature , thereby creating a plasma , it can be molded and shaped by magnetic and electrical fields . It can , for example , be shaped in the form of a sheet or window . Moreover , this " plasma window " can be used to separate a vacuum from ordinary air . In principle , one might be able to prevent the air within a spaceship from leaking out into space , thereby creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // In the Star Trek TV series , such a force field is used to separate the shuttle bay , containing small shuttle craft , from the vacuum of outer space . Not only is it a clever way to save money on props , but it is a device that is possible . // The plasma window was invented by physicist Ady Herschcovitch in 1995 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island , New York . He developed it to solve the problem of how to weld metals using electron beams . A welder 's acetylene torch uses a blast of hot gas to melt and then weld metal pieces together . But a beam of electrons can weld metals faster , cleaner , and more cheaply than ordinary methods . The problem with electron beam welding , however , is that it needs to be done in a vacuum . This requirement is quite inconvenient , because it means creating a vacuum box that may be as big as an entire room . // Dr. Herschcovitch invented the plasma window to solve this problem . Only 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plasma window heats gas to 12,000 ? F , creating a plasma that is trapped by electric and magnetic fields . These particles exert pressure , as in any gas , which prevents air from rushing into the vacuum chamber , thus separating air from the vacuum . ( When one uses argon gas in the plasma window , it glows blue , like the force field in Star Trek. ) // The plasma window has wide applications for space travel and industry . Many times , manufacturing processes need a vacuum to perform microfabrication and dry etching for industrial purposes , but working in a vacuum can be expensive . But with the plasma window one can cheaply contain a vacuum with the flick of a button . // But can the plasma window also be used as an impenetrable shield ? Can it withstand a blast from a cannon ? In the future , one can imagine a plasma window of much greater power and temperature , sufficient to damage or vaporize incoming projectiles . But to create a more realistic force field , like that found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies stacked in layers . Each layer might not be strong enough alone to stop a cannon ball , but the combination might suffice . // The outer layer could be a supercharged plasma window , heated to temperatures high enough to vaporize metals . A second layer could be a curtain of high-energy laser beams . This curtain , containing thousands of crisscrossing laser beams , would create a lattice that would heat up objects that passed through it , effectively vaporizing them . I will discuss lasers further in the next chapter . // And behind this laser curtain one might envision a lattice made of " carbon nanotubes , " tiny tubes made of individual carbon atoms that are one atom thick and that are many times stronger than steel . Although the current world record for a carbon nanotube is only about 15 millimeters long , one can envision a day when we might be able to create carbon nanotubes of arbitrary length . Assuming that carbon nanotubes can be woven into a lattice , they could create a screen of enormous strength , capable of repelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each carbon nanotube is atomic in size , but the carbon nanotube lattice would be stronger than any ordinary material . // So , via a combination of plasma window , laser curtain , and carbon nanotube screen , one might imagine creating an invisible wall that would be nearly impenetrable by most means . // Yet even this multilayered shield would not completely fulfill all the properties of a science fiction force field-because it would be transparent and therefore incapable of stopping a laser beam . In a battle with laser cannons , the multilayered shield would be useless . //
