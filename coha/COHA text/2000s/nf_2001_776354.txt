Justice : // A Father 's Account of the Trial of His Daughter 's Killer // It was the beginning of a long hot summer . I flew to Los Angeles on July 5 , 1983 , for an indefinite stay . Throughout the flight from New York I engaged in diligent conversation with the stranger next to me , postponing as long as possible facing the feelings of dread within me . My two sons , Griffin and Alex , had preceded me out from New York . Alex , the younger one , met me at the airport , and we drove into Beverly Hills to the house where my former wife , Ellen Griffin Dunne , called Lenny , lives . Griffin was already there . It is not the house we lived in as a family . It is smaller and on one level . Lenny has multiple sclerosis and is confined to a wheelchair . We were gathering , a family again , for a murder trial . // The first time I saw Lenny she was getting off a train at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I knew that instant that I would marry her if she would have me . We had a large wedding at her family 's ranch in Nogales , Arizona , in 1954 , and after living briefly in New York , we moved to Beverly Hills , where I worked for twenty-five years in television and films . We had five children , two of whom died when they were only a few days old . Long divorced , we have , rightly or wrongly , never become unmarried . Often I have felt through the years that our lives might have been better if we had just stuck out the difficult years of our marriage , but I do not know if she would agree with that . We never venture into the realm of what might have been . I refer to her in conversation as my wife , never my ex-wife , and there is not a day in which she does not occupy my thoughts for some period of time . We communicate regularly and mail each other clippings we cut out of newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addressing her as Mrs. E. Griffin Dunne rather than as Mrs. Dominick Dunne . // When the telephone in my New York apartment woke me at five o'clock in the morning on October 31 , 1982 , I sensed as I reached for the receiver that disaster loomed . Det . Harold Johnston of the Los Angeles Homicide Bureau told me that my twenty-two-year-old daughter , Dominique , was near death at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . I asked him if he had notified my wife . He said he was calling from her home . Lenny got on the phone and said , " I need you . " // " What happened ? " I asked , afraid to hear . // " Sweeney , " she answered . // " I 'll be on the first plane . " // I called Griffin , then twenty-seven , who lives two blocks away from me in New York , and within minutes he was at my door . He called TWA and reserved a seat on the next flight . Then he went to an automatic teller machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase , I hesitated over my black suit and tie , thinking they might be bad luck , but I packed them . Before I got into the taxi , I hugged Griffin and kissed him . He was to go then to the apartment of my second son , Alex , and break the news to him . Uniquely individual , Alex chose to live with no telephone on Pitt Street in a relatively inaccessible part of New York . Only Alex , of the four of us , had voiced his dislike of John Sweeney when Dominique introduced him into our lives . // She had brought him to New York several months earlier for the boys and me to meet . Dominique was a successful young television actress , who had just made her first major feature film , Poltergeist . Sweeney was the head chef at Ma Maison , a West Hollywood restaurant so concerned with its fashionable image that it had an unlisted telephone number to discourage the hoi polloi from entering its portals . We watched an episode of the television series Fame in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner . At one moment when the four of us were alone , the boys teased Dominique about marriage , and she said , oh no , she was not getting married , and I knew she meant it . I was relieved , for although I could see Sweeney was excessively devoted to her , there was something off-putting about him . That night I phoned her mother and said , " He is much more in love with her than she is with him , " and Lenny said , " You 're absolutely right . " // The next morning Alex told me of an incident that had occurred in P.J. Clarke 's after I left them . While Sweeney was in the men 's room , a man at the bar recognized Dominique as the older sister in Poltergeist and called out one of her lines from the film : " What 's happening ? " Dominique screams that line when evil spirits start to take over her home and cause frightening things to happen . A film clip of that scene has been shown so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the country . There was no flirtation ; it was the case of a slightly tipsy fan delighted to be in the presence of an actress he had seen in a film . But when Sweeney returned to the table and saw the man talking to Dominique , he became enraged . He picked up the man and shook him . Alex said that Sweeney 's reaction was out of all proportion to the innocent scene going on . Alex said he was scary . // The following day I arrived a few minutes late at Lut ? ce , where I was meeting Dominique and Sweeney for lunch . They had not yet arrived , so I sat at a table in the bar to wait for them . I finished one Perrier and ordered another , and was beginning to think there had been a misunderstanding about either the time or the place when they entered the restaurant . It was a hot summer day , and Dominique looked marvelous in a starched white organdy dress , very California-looking . I was immediately aware that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The chef made a great fuss over Sweeney . There was kissing on both cheeks , and they spoke together in French . At the chef 's suggestion we ate the sp ? cialit ? of the day , whatever it was , but the lunch was not a success . I found Sweeney ill at ease , nervous , difficult to talk to . It occurred to me that Dominique might have difficulty extricating herself from such a person , but I did not pursue the thought . // On the Fourth of July the three of us dined at the River Caf ? under the Brooklyn Bridge . It was a lovely night , and we were at a window table where we could watch the fireworks . Sweeney told me he intended to leave Ma Maison . He said he had backing from a consortium of French and Japanese businessmen and was going to open his own restaurant in Melrose Park , a highly desirable location in Los Angeles . Never once did he speak affectionately of his employer , Patrick Terrail , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . In fact , I suspected there were bad feelings between them . // On that endless flight to Los Angeles I did not allow myself to consider the possibility of her death . She was making a pilot at Warner Bros. for an NBC miniseries called V , and I remember thinking that they would have to shoot around her until she was on her feet again . Five weeks earlier she had broken up with John Sweeney , and he had moved out of the house they shared in West Hollywood . Her explanation to me at the time was , " He 's not in love with me , Dad . He 's obsessed with me . It 's driving me crazy . " // Two other daughters preceding Dominique died in infancy from a lung disease once common in cesarean births known as hyaline membrane disease . Dominique was all three daughters in one to us , triply loved . She adored her older brothers and was always totally at ease in a sophisticated world without being sophisticated herself . She was a collector of stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobotomy and a large dog with stunted legs . She went to Westlake School in Los Angeles , then to Taft School in Connecticut , then to Fountain Valley School in Colorado . After that she spent a year in Florence , where she learned to speak Italian . Twice she and I took trips in Italy together . Extravagantly emotional , she was heartbroken when Lenny gave up the family home on Walden Drive because her worsening condition made it unmanageable . I was not surprised when Dominique announced her intention to become an actress . Griffin , who is an actor and a producer , later said jokingly that one day she decided to become an actress and the next week she was on a back lot making a movie , and that from then on she never stopped . It was very nearly true . She loved being an actress and was passionate about her career . // By the time I arrived in Los Angeles at noon that Sunday , the report that Dominique had been strangled outside her home by her former boyfriend and was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news channels and stations . Mart Crowley , the author of The Boys in the Band , the film version of which I had produced , met me at the airport and filled me in with what little information he had got from Lenny . Lenny 's house on Crescent Drive was full of people when we got there . ( It would stay that way from early morning until late at night for the next seven or eight days , during which relay teams of friends manned the telephones , screened the calls , handled the coffee detail , accepted the endless deliveries of flowers , made all the arrangements for our day-to-day living . ) All the television sets and radios were on for news bulletins . In the midst of this confusion sat Lenny in her wheelchair . She was very calm . " The news is not good , " she said to me . And within minutes I heard the words " brain damage " being whispered around the house . // Lenny 's mother , who had heard the news on the radio , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plane would be in in a few hours . My relatives in Hartford called , and , as the news spread , so did friends in New York and London . A doctor at the hospital telephoned for my permission to insert a bolt into Dominique 's skull to relieve the pressure on her brain . Was it absolutely necessary ? I asked . Yes , he replied . All right , I said . I asked him when we could go and see her . Not yet , he said . // The boys arrived , ashen-faced . When the time came to go to the hospital , we were full of dreadful apprehension . Some friends said to Lenny , " You must n't go . It would be a terrible mistake to look at her this way . You must remember her as she was . " They were , of course , thinking of Lenny 's health ; stress is the worst thing for multiple sclerosis victims . She replied , " The mistake would be if I did n't see her . That is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of us proceeded in silence through the maze of corridors leading to the intensive care unit on the fifth floor of Cedars-Sinai . One of us , I do n't remember which , pushed Lenny 's wheelchair , and the other two flanked her  --  a formation we would automatically fall into many times in the year that followed . Outside the double doors of the unit are printed instructions telling you to buzz and announce yourself . I did so : " The family of Dominique Dunne is here . " We were told to wait , that someone would come out and get us. // Several people were standing there , among them the actor George Hamilton . We exchanged greetings . George said his brother was also in the ICU , and that he had been there the night before when Dominique was brought in . Another man introduced himself to us as Ken Johnson , the director of the pilot Dominique was working on . Waiting nearby was a young actor in the same film named David Packer , his eyes red from crying . Packer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of the attack and had called in the police , albeit too late . Later we also learned that Packer became so frightened by the struggle he heard outside on the lawn that he left a message on a friend 's answering machine saying , " If I die tonight , it was by John Sweeney. " // A nurse appeared and told us that after we had seen Dominique the doctors would want to talk with us . She said that no one but immediate family would be allowed in , and asked us to show identification . They were afraid the press would try to pass themselves off as members of the family . She warned us that it would be a shock to look at her , that we should be prepared . // I worried about Lenny and looked over at her . She closed her eyes , bowed her head , and took a deep breath . I watched her will strength into herself , through some inner spiritual force , in a moment so intensely private that I dared not , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , she was the strongest when we entered the room . // At first I did not realize that the person on the bed was Dominique . There were tubes in her everywhere , and the life-support system caused her to breathe in and out with a grotesque jerking movement that seemed a parody of life . Her eyes were open , massively enlarged , staring sightlessly up at the ceiling . Her beautiful hair had been shaved off . A large bolt had been screwed into her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain . Her neck was purpled and swollen ; vividly visible on it were the marks of the massive hands of the man who had strangled her . It was nearly impossible to look at her , but also impossible to look away . // Lenny wheeled her chair to the bed , took Dominique 's hand in hers , and spoke to her in a voice of complete calm . " Hello , my darling , it 's Mom . We 're all here , Dominique . Dad and Griffin and Alex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the boys and I stepped forward and surrounded the bed , each touching a different part of Dominique . The nurses had said that she could not hear us , but we felt she could , and took turns talking to her . We prayed for her to live even though we knew that it would be best for her to die . // There was a small conference room in the ICU where we met periodically over the next four days to discuss her ebbing life . Dr. Edward Brettholz told us that the brain scan was even , meaning that it showed no life , but that it would be necessary to take three more scans so that , in the trial ahead , the defense could not claim that Cedars-Sinai had removed Dominique from the life-support system too soon . This was the first mention of a trial . In the shocked state in which we were operating , we had not yet started to deal with the fact that a murder had taken place .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
