She has the eyes of an orphan too proud to plead , too desperate to reproach . She is poor , female and 12 , and in mid- ' 90s Afghanistan , with the Taliban thug clerics in power , that means no schooling , employment or respect . Then her mother has an idea . Cut the girl 's hair , dress her in robes and give her a boy 's name  --  Osama  --  so she can find work as a " boy " and support the tattered family . <P> The plot of Siddiq Barmak 's Osama sounds like a twist on an old story . It 's an unsentimental Yentl or  --  considering the eerie resemblance of Osama 's Marina Golbahari to Hilary Swank  --  an Afghan Boys Do n't Cry . In 2001 Iran produced a similar fable , Baran , set among illegal Afghan refugees in Tehran . But life has ways of imitating art . Osama , the first feature made in Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power , is based on a true story . And truth shines through every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young star 's unaffected radiance . <P> The mother 's reckless ruse has ominous consequences . Everyone notices that this Osama is different  --  " like a nymph , " one man says . After landing a menial job , the girl is taken to the men-only prayer ritual , where each lad is instructed in the proper washing of the male genitals . Her deceit is discovered when she has her first menstrual period , and she is married off to an old mullah . <P> Heartfelt and handsomely made , Osama is the story not just of one unfortunate girl but of a nation besieged by autocratic theocracy . The film roams Kabul 's streets for vignettes of the regime 's depredations . When a Taliban inspector arrives at a hospital where a female doctor is treating an old man , the doctor must conceal herself by quickly donning a burqa and claiming she is the wife of her patient 's son . <P> A film like this from a country like Afghanistan might seem a curiosity . It is more like a miracle . When the Taliban took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reels of film . Barmak , then head of the state-run Afghan Film Organization , fled Kabul and made documentaries for Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud ( later assassinated by al-Qaeda ) . After the regime 's overthrow , he returned to make educational films for the illiterate majority and toured the country with eight cinema caravans , which also screened old Chaplin and Keaton comedies . " Our technical guys cried , " he says . " It was the first time they had seen people laugh in years . " <P> Barmak found his Osama leading lady on a Kabul street : a girl approached him , begging for money . " Her eyes , " he says , " were like an explosion of light . " Golbahari did n't need to reach deep for the emotions she was to show onscreen . " He asked what made me sad , " she says . " I thought about my sisters , who died during the war , and I just started crying . " <P> Afghanistan , whose headlines for years read like a wail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now its citizens can laugh and cry at the movies . The rest of us can cheer .  --  By Richard Corliss .
