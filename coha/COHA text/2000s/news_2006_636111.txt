<p> Was n't the thrill powerful enough just to be Ben Roethlisberger , to have wealth and fame and funny TV ads , to be the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl ? Did n't he have everything a 24-year-old guy could want , a bachelor 's life and a long career ahead of him ? Did he really need additional fulfillment from a black 2005 Suzuki Hayabusa , said to be the fastest motorcycle on the market for legal street riding ? <p> I once asked similar questions about the less accomplished but highly promising Jay Williams , after he smashed his new motorcycle into a North Side light pole and was fortunate as hell to live and tell about it . When his NBA career ended immediately , thanks to a fractured pelvis and severe leg and knee injuries , it should have served as the ultimate lesson for any pro athlete who believes he 's invincible enough to take risks on a motorcycle or in other hazardous endeavors . <p> But Big Ben did n't hear . Nor did he hear when a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bike and jeopardized his career . Nor did he heed the lessons of other athletes who have had careers shortened , including New York Jets cornerback Jamie Henderson , who wound up in a coma two years ago and eventually was waived after failing a physical . When Roethlisberger 's coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers , Bill Cowher , lectured his franchise player last year following Winslow 's crash , the message did n't sink in . <p> " Cowher talked about being a risk-taker , and I 'm not really a risk-taker . I 'm pretty conservative and laid-back , but the big thing is to be careful , " Roethlisberger explained then . " I 'll just continue to be careful . I told him we do n't ever ride alone , we always ride in a group of people , and I think it makes it even more safe . " <p> But is n't it risky simply to get on a motorcycle , particularly without a helmet ? " Well , it 's just like everything else , " he said in an ESPN interview . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . You can get killed walking down the street . You have to know what you 're doing . It 's a risk , but being in life is a risk . " <p> Too bad he viewed his logic as a justification , not as a deterrent . Too bad he did n't realize life is enough of a crapshoot to take unnecessary gambles . Because on Monday morning in downtown Pittsburgh , when he could have been playing golf or traveling the world , Roethlisberger 's supercharged bike collided with a Chrysler New Yorker driven by a 62-year-old woman in a crash that threw him through the air and left his immediate football career in doubt . As TV networks showed footage of his mangled motorcycle , which looked much like Williams ' mangled bike in 2003 , Roethlisberger was in serious but stable condition after seven hours of surgery for multiple facial fractures . <p> His jaw was broken . So was his left sinus cavity . Reportedly , there was a 9-inch gash on the back of his head and minor injuries to his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic surgery was said to be required for facial reconstruction . If that is the full extent of his injuries , as doctors said Monday night , he is very lucky . Apparently , his brain , spine , chest and abdomen survived without serious consequence . <p> STEELERS COULD HAVE BEEN TOUGHER <p> And hopefully , there 's an athlete with a motorcycle  --  for that matter , anyone with a motorcycle  --  who might think twice about riding now that his grisly story is known . If nothing else , ride with a helmet , something Roethlisberger was n't required to do in a state , Pennsylvania , that foolishly repealed a 35-year helmet law in 2004 . " Obviously , Pennsylvania does n't think people need to wear a helmet , " he said . " There 's a law you 've got to wear it in football . " If Roethlisberger did n't want to find a safer hobby , maybe thousands of others will after absorbing the running commentary of witness Sandra Ford , who saw him hurtle onto the pavement . <p> " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , " she said . " He was n't really speaking . He seemed dazed , but he was resisting the effort to make him stay down . " <p> Horrible as I feel for Ben and his family , good people from Ohio who raised a down-to-earth son emerging as an American folk hero , I ca n't help but ask why the Steelers did n't have a motorcycle-specific clause in Roethlisberger 's contract prohibiting him such activity . The Cleveland Browns had that clause in Winslow 's contract and did n't have to pay him millions when he missed last season . There is standard language in all NFL contracts concerning " significant risk of personal injury " off the field , and , in a worst-case scenario , Roethlisberger could forfeit salary if he misses substantial playing time . But the Steelers , knowing all about his hobby , should have been more proactive in installing a clause that would have kept him off the bike . <p> His father asked him not to ride . Cowher strongly discouraged him . So did former Steelers great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound advice : Wait until you 're done playing , when you can do what you want when you want . But Roethlisberger refused to obey their advice . In an interview with Andrea Kremer , then with ESPN , he suggested he would have stopped riding if the Steelers had firmly told him no . " If it was in my contract and it said I can not ride a motorcycle , then I ca n't ride a motorcycle , " he said . <p> What if the Steelers inserted the clause ? " I would n't be happy , but that 's part of the deal . If your boss says you ca n't do it , you ca n't do it , " he said . <p> There is no clause , right ? " Right . We 've gone over that with a fine-toothed comb ... not breaking the rules , exactly , just like wearing a helmet . If the law says I need to wear a helmet , I 'll wear a helmet . " <p> Then he said Cowher was n't nearly as firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride , " Ben said . " He never told me to wear a helmet . Then people said that I denied everything he said . He did n't say anything like that . He just told me be careful and use my head . " If true , Cowher must be sick to his stomach . When an authority figure is trying to lay down the law , he ca n't go halfway . <p> TEAMS SHOULD CLOSE LOOPHOLES <p> Pro teams invest too many millions , especially on long-term cornerstones such as Roethlisberger , to let loose contractual ends hang . Franchises in this town and across the land would be smart to close all loopholes and scare motorcycle riders  --  as well as bungee-jumpers , hang-gliders , grizzly-bear hunters and even pro wrestlers I mean you , A.J. Pierzynski  --  while using the Big Ben story as Exhibit B. <p> The Jay Williams crash always will be Exhibit A , at least in this century . More than two years after the Bulls generously reached a $3 million settlement with him , the former Duke star has worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend for the New Jersey Nets . It 's nice to see him with a chipper attitude . " I actually think I 'm ready to play now , " he said . " I 'm not going to be a point guard who 's going to try to score 40 points . I 'm going to be a guy who 's going to get all my teammates involved . " <p> Chances are , he wo n't make it back to the NBA . So sadly , he left his career on a North Side street , an episode that did n't properly scare Ben Roethlisberger . Hopefully , his story will properly scare someone else . <p> Jay Mariotti is a regular on " Around the Horn " at 4 p.m. on ESPN .
