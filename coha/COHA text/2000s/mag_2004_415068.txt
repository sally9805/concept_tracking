Matagente ( mah-tah-HEN-tay ) is a Spanish word meaning " killers . " The name of this game from Peru sounds scary , but the only " weapon " in the game is a playground ball . A player can even be a nice guy in Matagente , by giving an extra life to another player . Equipment * An inflatable rubber playground ball , such as the kind you would use to play dodgeball or foursquare * Chalk or sticks and stones to mark the play area Number of Players Any number from three to fifteen people can play .
