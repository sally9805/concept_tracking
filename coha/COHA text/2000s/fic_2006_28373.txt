" You act like you do n't trust us or something ! " " It 's prom night , Daddy ! " Ariana piped in . " All our friends are going to the after party . " Exasperation drew lines on Terry Winston 's face . " And I have to tell you how many times , I do n't care what your friends are doing because they 're no concern of mine ? " " You know we really do n't need your permission , " Alisa said , testing the waters of defiance . " We 're legally adults ! " Ariana stared at her mirror image in disbelief . She had to think quickly to counteract her sister 's temporary bout of insanity . " I think what Alisa means is that- " " Girl , you are straight up trippin ' . " The veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Alisa 's face . " As long as my name is Terrance Winston and it appears on your birth certificate , my blood runs through your veins and you 're slipping your key in my front door every day and driving the car that I make the payments on and- " " Girls , " their mother , Jackie , interrupted , " let me talk to your father for a moment . And , Alisa , I recommend you take a few moments to adjust your attitude before this family meeting reconvenes . " Ariana pushed her sister through the arched opening that separated the family room fromthe kitchen . Alisa jerked away , turning slightly to roll her eyes at her sister . " You 're just tryin ' to be Miss Goody-goody , " she hissed . " You know you want this as much as I do ! " " Just go , " Ariana whispered . " If you keep this up , we wo n't even get to go to the prom . " The two bounced up the wide staircase , splitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms adjoined . " You seem to forget we 're grown , " Alisa yelled after her sister just before stepping into her bedroom and slamming the door . Terry sat with his head in his hands , trying to understand where his sweet , almost-perfect daughters had gone and when the imposter who 'd taken over Alisa 's body had made the switch . In the scheme of things he really needed to count his many blessings . Ariana and Alisa Winston were top honor roll students as they approached high school graduation . They had been accepted by their top three choices of colleges with offers of full scholarships . To everyone 's surprise , the girls were contemplating going separate ways in pursuit of their very grand academic dreams , which included environmental design for Ariana and journalism for Alisa . By anyone 's standard , Terry Winston had been a wonderful father since the day he decided he could n't let Catherine Hawkins , their birth mother , put them up for adoption . He 'd brought his darling princesses home from the hospital , determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off in pursuit of her career goals . In spite-or perhaps because-of it all , he knew today as he 'd known then that there had been no other decision he could have made . He loved those girls so much that he would have given them the shirt off his back if they needed it . Moments like these , however , made him understand why his temples , mustache and five o'clock shadow bore the distinction of time . Thank goodness for his wife . Jacqueline Rogers-Winston was the anchor in the many stormy seas of his life . A sense of calm began to radiate through him as he felt the warmth of her touch in the center of his back . " Are you okay ? " " Not hardly ! " Terry took her hand and pulled her around to sit on his lap . " When did she get so belligerent ? " " Honey , she 's just feeling her womanhood . She thinks she 's grown . Every girl goes through the very same thing , " Jackie said as she slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't happen any earlier . " " Then why is Ariana so different ? " Terry pulled back to make eye contact with his wife of seven wonder-filled years . " They look like the same person , walk and talk the same , but when it comes to personality they are as different as sunshine and rain . " " You seem to forget that it 's all still weather . But amazingly they really are n't that different . They both work you like a baker kneading dough , but Ariana just has more finesse . " Jackie kissed him gently on the forehead . " And then , toss a little estrogen and oxygen into the mix and , voila , there you have it-women ! " Staring deeply into Jackie 's eyes , Terry wondered what he 'd done to deserve such a woman . His soul had connected with hers the moment he 'd seen her in the supermarket on the rainy afternoon nearly thirteen years before . " What am I going to do ? " Laughing , Jackie pulled back and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She walked around the couch into the kitchen , retrieving coffee mugs from the dishwasher . The sound echoed through the large , airy space as she placed them on the counter . She placed her hand on the cool granite and thought a moment before she turned and continued . " This is such a difficult age for everyone . They are in fact adults , though you think of them as your little girls . Look at them . They 're built like supermodels with beauty to match , yet they still want nothing more than to please their daddy . They have the pressure of friends and adversaries alike to do this or to act like that . You seem to think that you 're the only one with a hard job in all of this . " Jackie poured two cups of coffee , added a little Baileys Irish Cream in both and moved back toward the family room . " So you 're saying I should let them stay out all night ? " Terry wanted to be angry , but confusion won out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed them on the cherrywood table . Jackie set the mugs down and turned to her husband in the same movement . " Not at all . What I am saying is there should be some kind of compromise . " " I 'm their father . I do n't have to conciliate with them ! " Terry stood , looking down at Jackie . " Teresa Winston never negotiated with me . It was her way or the highway . " " Times are different . " Jackie grabbed his hand and pulled him back to the sofa . " And you 'd lose your natural mind if Ariana and Alisa decided they wanted to take the highway . " " Alrighty then , Ms. I've-got-all-the-answers , what do I do ? No daughter of mine is going to be out all night with my blessings . The only things open after two a.m. are legs ! " Laughing , Jackie found it difficult to be serious . Trying to compose her thoughts for a clever comeback , she gave birth to what she considered sheer genius . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at her as though she were an alien , Terry finally said , " Are you nuts ? Do you know what a house full of teenagers could do to this place ? Look around you . We have beige carpeting and hardwood floors , antiques , fine crystal . We 'd have to take out a rider to our homeowners ' policy . " Terry picked up the coffee mug and blew on the mocha liquid absentmindedly . Touching his knee and forcing Terry to make eye contact with her , Jackie continued , " But look at the beauty of this . They get to party all night with their friends , doing whatever it is eighteen-year-olds do , with your watchful eye right upstairs the whole time . And even if the floors get scuffed and the carpet stained , is n't that a very small price to pay for their happiness and your peace of mind ? " This woman is as smart as she is sexy . Terry smiled . He had to admit her plan did seem without flaws . " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the words of the great don , make them an offer they ca n't refuse . " " Such as ? " " First find out what the other after party is offering " - Jackie grinned with satisfaction- " then trump it ! " Smiling at her , Terry thought back to the many times she 'd been the answer not only to his prayers but also the desires of his heart . " How do you come up with this stuff ? " " Just brilliance , my love , sheer brilliance . " She winked . " I think you should call them back down , first making Alisa apologize for her behavior , which immediately puts her at a disadvantage . " Just as Terry was about to summon his firstborn , Michelle , Michael and Terrance Junior rushed up the stairs from the basement playroom . " Mommy , can we have some popcorn ? " Michael yelled as he approached his parents . " Boy , you just had dinner not more than an hour ago . Where do you put it all ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box in the pantry . I want to see your homework when you 're done with the popcorn . Yours too , Michelle and T.J. " " Yes , ma'am , " T.J. said with the enthusiasm of a six-year-old who had n't completed his assigned task . Michelle beamed with pride . " I 'm done . You can check mine now , Mommy . " " Whatever , " Michael mumbled in a baritone voice reserved for someone well beyond thirteen . As the children headed for the walk-in pantry to retrieve an evening snack , Jackie 's heart felt full , remembering how the two families had blended seamlessly seven years before . Only those who had known them for many years knew the story of how Terry 's identical twins daughters and Jackie 's fraternal twins became the loving Winston clan . And the cement that brought it all together was Terry 's namesake , Terrance Winston Junior . " So you think this will really work ? " Terry interrupted her reverie . " I mean , how do we even begin to plan a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious look crept across Terry 's face . " I mean , what do we allow ? Do we chaperone ? " Rising , Jackie looked back at Terry and smiled . " You convince them this is a great idea and I 'll handle the rest . " Terry watched Jackie 's full , round behind as she switched into the kitchen . Opening the door to the built-in refrigerator that blended with the oak cabinetry , she bent to retrieve a fruit drink , and Terry found himself moaning involuntarily . Jackie stirred him in ways he had never even imagined a woman could . He could n't understand why Jackie had such issues with her size . The thought of her softness , silky smooth skin , round bottom , full breasts , thick thighs , the heat that radiated from her booty as they slept . . . lawdhamercy ! The rumbling taking place above his head shifted his attention from the woman with whom he desperately wanted to sneak into the pantry for just a few stolen moments . " What in the . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two at a time . " I swear , sometimes they act like they 're the babies in this house , " he mumbled as he reached the landing leading to the east wing of the house . He stood outside Ariana 's room and listened to the two argue before knocking . " I do n't need you to talk for me . I can tell Daddy what I mean . " Though Terry could n't see who was speaking , he knew it was Alisa . " You need someone to keep your stupid behind out of trouble . If you do n't stop this , I 'm scared we wo n't get to go anywhere at all ! " Ariana 's voice had a tone of pleading . " What 's the big deal about going to the after party anyway ? " " Everyone will be there is the big deal . How can the most popular twins in the senior class not be ? " " Alisa , we 're the only twins in the senior class ! " Terry knocked lightly . " Go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled just before she snatched the door opened . " Daddy ? " Ariana said , taken aback . With his hand positioned to knock again , Terry said , " Oh , so you were expecting whom ? " He struggled to calm the anger he felt at Alisa at that moment . " May I come in ? " " Sure , Daddy . I thought maybe you were Michelle . She asked me to help her with something . " Ariana did n't make eye contact with her father , which was a good sign she was fishing for a believable response . " What 's going on up here ? " Terry stepped into the large space decorated in various shades of yellow and blue . The queen-size canopy bed with canary-yellow and cobalt-blue netting draped over the posts showed signs of a tussle . " It sounded like you were coming through the ceiling downstairs . " Terry eyed the matching pillows that were tossed about the room . Alisa turned away from her father , folding her arms . " We 're having a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this house , it became public . " Terry moved to the blue-and-yellow patchwork-covered footstool and sat . " What are you two fighting about this time ? " " She 's such a suck-up ! I want to go to the after party and so does she , but she 's saying whatever it is that you want to hear ! " Anger filled Alisa 's beautiful face . " You always taught us to be our own person and to stand up for whatever it is that we believe . " " And you believe what about this ? " Terry asked calmly . " I believe we 're adults , and legally you ca n't tell us what we can and can not do . " Alisa eyed her sister , asking for collaboration , but Ariana 's stony face yielded little support . Terry was stoic . Alisa continued , " I know we still live in your house and with that comes certain rules . . . " Terry saw Alisa start to squirm and , enjoying the assumed shift of power , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you need to relax our curfew . " Confidence fleeing rapidly , Alisa lowered her head and voice . " At least on prom night . " " I see . " Tension began to permeate the air as Terry turned to Ariana , who stood with her back pressed against the door . " And what do you have to say , young lady ? " As she dropped her head , the only sound that could be heard in the room was the ticking of the clocks representing the four time zones of the United States , each slightly off cadence with the other . " I 'd like to hang with our friends after the prom . Could we compromise and go out to eat and maybe come home by four ? " " I would have considered this counterproposal , but your sister 's attitude has me more than just a little concerned . Since you 're grown , then perhaps we need to make other living arrangements . " Terry toyed with them . " Grown is as grown does . I think you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they sang in unison . Terry suppressed a chuckle . " Daddy what ? " " When you think you can apologize to me and your mother for that outburst downstairs , you let me know . " Terry rose .
