<p> For all the students cramming for big tests , for all the baby boomers who stop in blank embarrassment trying to recall whether they 're headed for the coffee pot or the potty , for all of us who ca n't conjure up the names of people we know we know , new help is here  --  and it 's gone high-tech . <p> Anxiety about forgetfulness has spawned a multimillion-dollar industry of memory aids , consisting of books , playing cards , board games , videos , manuals and dietary supplements . <p> And in cyberspace , dozens of online sites are jockeying to help remind customers of important dates through e-mail  --  much less Luddite than a string on the finger . The Internet has also spawned cyberspace " brain gyms " that claim they can make your mind stronger by offering a dizzying array of mental calisthenics . <p> Robert Thompson , an expert on popular culture at Syracuse University , says interest in memory is rising because almost everyone has so much more to forget : passwords , appointments , cellphone numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " When you have a culture that is packaging all this data , inevitably you 're going to have another culture based on how you 're going to retrieve all this stuff you cram into your head . " <p> Paula McLaughlin , 53 , of Conyers signed up recently as a client of MemoryConcepts.com , a new New York-based company that offers a slew of mind-bending online interactive exercises . <p> " I 'm always writing notes to myself , and then I forget the notes , " she says . " I came home one night , and my girlfriend down the road was having a party . . . . I 'd completely forgotten , even though she had reminded me three times that day . I think it 's overload . " <p> She heard about MemoryConcepts , which went online last month , from a friend . And already , she feels it 's helping , though she concedes that might be wishful thinking . <p> " I just think this kind of thing must work , " she says . <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we experience and feel is processed by the brain and then stored in the temporal lobe , specifically the hippocampus , says Dr. Allan Levey , chairman of neurology at Emory University . <p> But much of how memory stores and retrieves information remains a mystery . <p> " We know an awful lot about how the brain works , but we have a long way to go , " he says . " We know about the circuits in the brain that are necessary for memory , and we even know some of the molecular basis for connections between neurons , which underlie memory . " <p> But no one is really clear why memory starts to fade during early middle age , he says . " There are probably many factors that contribute to decline , which vary in different people . " <p> Some people start losing memory about age 25 , and by 40 , almost everybody starts fading , he says . But unless they impede daily functions , moments of forgetfulness likely do n't mean much , if anything , Levey says . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lifestyle choices can sharpen people 's mental acuity . For example : <p> * California researchers reported at a conference last month that a diet rich in vitamins and antioxidants could slow down or reverse mental decline in old age . <p> * The journal Archives of Neurology reported that people who consume large quantities of saturated fats are twice as likely as those who do n't to have memory problems . <p> * A study in Neurology reported that formal education significantly diminished memory problems among people with Alzheimer 's . <p> * And finally , a study last year in the New England Journal of Medicine found that leisure activities like chess , checkers , crossword puzzles , playing a musical instrument and ballroom dancing seem to stave off memory loss . <p> Marilyn Margolis , 55 , of Sandy Springs  --  who admits to frequent " senior moments "  --  says she thinks such things help . " Anything that stretches your mind , " says the Alzheimer 's Association volunteer . She and her husband are avid Scrabble players . <p> But many experts like Levey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain bank . <p> It 's possible and even logical to think that mental workouts might tune up the brain , but to what extent , if any , has n't been shown conclusively . <p> Pills and potions <p> Uh , where were we ? <p> Oh right . Despite what researchers say , Americans are aggressively fighting forgetfulness  --  spending about $250 million a year on dietary supplements alone , not counting books and other tools . <p> And it 's clear that as America 's 77 million baby boomers age , more companies will try to capitalize on people 's desperate search for the Fountain of Youth ( or their car keys ) . <p> Already , thousands pop pills like Ginkgo biloba or Focus Factor . Some regularly chew on ginseng root . <p> Others are flocking to their computers for help . Computers that would laugh like HAL of " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " if they could at humans ' puny memory recall . Computers with enough megabyte memory to instantly conjure up hundreds of thousands of birthdays , appointments and a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mail , pager or cellphone . <p> The result : a growing number of Web sites like MemotoMe.com and Rememberit.com . So far , most are free , but they probably wo n't be for long . <p> MemotoMe.com has about 70,000 members and charges only for its " platinum " edition . It 'll send reminders on any day you specify to tip you off about Mother 's Day , a spouse 's birthday or a big meeting with the boss . <p> " I originally developed Memo to Me to help me personally , " says Joel Johnstone , whose company is based in San Diego . " I still get lots of ' wife points ' for remembering the anniversary of our first date every year . " <p> Then there 's 101-reminders.com , owned by Simon Conroy in England , who set it up " as a hobby " because he thought forgetful people like himself would find it useful . <p> " I 'm 35 , " Conroy says , " but I 'm terribly disorganized , and I used to always forget birthdays , anniversaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mails for free to remind subscribers about birthdays . Its revenue comes from ads and gifts subscribers can buy on the site . And for $24.95 a year , REMINDRx , at www.personalmd.com , reminds subscribers to take their medicine and keep appointments , in Greek if you choose . <p> Other services include BigDates.com , DiarySmart.com and Rememberit.com , which is based in Atlanta and has about 50,000 subscribers , says co-founder Mike Lynch . <p> Brain twisters <p> But in cyberspace , " brain gyms " rule as the hottest memory trend . <p> MyBrainTrainer.com , the brainchild of Bruce Friedman , a 54-year-old Los Angeles entrepreneur , bills itself as the world 's first " virtual mental gymnasium " and offers nine types of brain-twisting exercises and all sorts of memory-improving tips . <p> And unlike a host of other low-tech aides , MyBrainTrainer.com is not just after the baby boomer market , but youngsters headed to college or graduate , law or medical school . <p> MyBrainTrainer.com was endorsed just last month by New York-based Kaplan Inc. , the testing company that administers all sorts of standardized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college grads taking tests for law or medical schools . <p> Kaplan Inc. sent out 40,000 e-mails to students who 've signed up to take the medical school test , telling them it had reached an agreement with Friedman to let the youths do the MyBrainTrainer.com exercises for free . <p> " Certainly , we think MyBrainTrainer offers a creative approach to promoting mental acuity , " says Kaplan spokeswoman Carina Wong . " As Kaplan serves individuals who seek higher achievement , we 're always interested in technologies that can potentially help our students . " <p> The cerebral exercises offered on the Internet through such " brain gyms " often measure reflexes , perception , mental-processing speed and agility , analytical skills , concentration , visual recognition , memory capacity and vocabulary . <p> And they offer immediate feedback , letting you know how you did compared with others in your age range . And you can also track whether you get better the more you work out your mind  --  in effect using your computer like a bodybuilder uses a mirror . <p> " I 'm not injecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , founder of MemoryConcepts . " What we offer is a nontoxic way to keep your mind sharp . And hopefully this will reduce your risk for these later neurological disorders like Alzheimer 's , and stave them off . There 's some evidence that thinking hard strengthens the mind . " <p> Says Friedman : " Our exercises help you think quicker , retrieve information faster . It 's not a bunch of video games . " <p> ' Tickle your mind ' <p> But you do n't have to know the difference between RAM and sheep to practice brain benders . From crosswords to Scrabble to playing cards , there is a host of low-tech methods designed to do the same thing as the computer programs . <p> In Decatur , for example , a course called " Memory at Emory " offers such methods , like memory-honing playing cards and written exercises . <p> The point , says instructor John Thames , 60 , is to " tickle your mind in different ways . " The next course starts April 6 . <p> An educator for the Alzheimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people who seem as worried about their memories as older ones . <p> " I 'm getting some students in their 20s and 30s , " he says of his " Evening at Emory " course . " They get a job where they have to multi-task , and when you do that , people start forgetting things . " <p> The course gives tips about what students can do to improve concentration . And Thames is convinced that any system that challenges the mind will strengthen memories . <p> One of his students , Gloria Stuchlik , 36 , says the course helped her and that she practices mental exercises often . She took the course because she felt a stronger memory would make her better at remembering faces , important in her job as sales manager for the Emory Conference Center . <p> " I wanted to get better at that , and I have , " she says . " You have to concentrate . You have to work at it . " <p> Or you can forget all of this and just revert to the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around your wrist . Slap Post-it notes around the house or e-mail your own to-do reminders from home to work and back again . Stuchlik still does that . <p> You can still write on the mirror with toothpaste and put your keys on top of your wallet . And , most importantly , you can stick your scribbled to-do lists in your pockets . <p> After all , you 'll remember them  --  days later at the dry cleaner . " Finding Nemo " is all about remembering what 's important in life . And often , that 's done through the dialogue of a forgetful little fish . The quirky movie , which won an Oscar for best animated feature film , reflects popular culture 's recent fascination with memory loss . In it , a blue tang named Dory is afflicted with CRS ( Ca n't Remember Stuff ) but helps track down a fish named Nemo , who 's been captured and carried to a dentist 's aquarium . But a blue fish on the silver screen is n't the only " memorable " character . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls in love with a woman who has short-term memory loss caused by a head injury she suffered in a car accident . And on Friday , " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " is slated to open , featuring Jim Carrey as a man who undergoes a process to remove all memories of his ex-girlfriend . With forgetfulness being a growing concern of the nation 's 77 million baby boomers  --  and many of their young'uns , there 's nothing fishy about the keen interest in such movies .  --  Bill Hendrick ; Graphic : TIPS TO IMPROVE MEMORY <p> * Do crossword puzzles . One published study found that seniors who did crossword puzzles four days a week had a 47 percent lower risk of dementia than seniors who did puzzles only once a week . <p> * Take up dancing , bridge , or take continuing education courses .
