TAMPA RAIN // We are pressed on every side by troubles , but we are not crushed . We are perplexed , but not driven to despair . We are hunted down , but never abandoned by God . We get knocked down , but we are not destroyed . 2 Corinthians 4:8-9 // IT WAS TIME . I figured I had waited long enough . Darkness had fallen on that winter evening , two days after our team 's business had concluded for the season . The building was otherwise deserted as I pulled up and parked at the small wooden shack guarding the entrance to One Buccaneer Place . // One Buc , as we all called it , stood quiet . The one-story , stucco and concrete block building was located on the edge of the Tampa International Airport . The color of butter pecan ice cream , this was the original building that housed the newly formed Buccaneers in 1976 . Rather than expand the building as the organization exploded in size over the years-as personnel were added for coaching , scouting , marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had simply added a series of trailers on the other side of a small parking lot in the late 1990s . The trailers were collectively known as Two Buc. // Oscar , the guard on duty , escorted me through the locked gate on the side of the building ; my security code no longer worked . Silently I gathered six years ' worth of my professional life from my office-three-ring binders with notes , play diagrams , and play-calling sheets ; various books and photographs ; my sons ' video games ; and a couple of Buccaneers hats , although I 'd never wear them again . I was lost in my memories as I placed these things rather haphazardly in cardboard boxes thoughtfully left out for me by my administrative assistant . No , I realized , Lora is somebody else 's administrative assistant now . // I stopped to contemplate a wood-framed picture in the stack . It had been taken our first year in Tampa , and we were all beaming : my daughter , Tiara ; my sons , Jamie and Eric ; my wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a vibrant green , the shade of an Irish meadow , sliced into five-yard increments by crisp , white stripes . A teeming throng of humanity , dressed in orange and red and squinting in the unforgiving Florida sun , filled the stands in the picture 's background . // The summer of 1996 had been a long time ago . // Now , in the winter of 2002 , that same Florida sky was dark . Dark , cold , and damp . The mist that had begun in the afternoon had turned to light drops . The weather mirrored my dark inner world on that night of January 14. // * * * // I finished packing the last of the items . Not that much , really . A few boxes stood by the door , ready to be carried home . Nothing else of note remained . That office of mine had been lived in pretty hard , I had to admit . Most of the homework completed by my sons Jamie and Eric over the previous six years had been done in there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitions , and other pursuits geared around young boys . // I later learned that Rich McKay , general manager of the Bucs during my tenure as head coach , had asked the facility manager to clean and paint the office that week , noting that my replacement was " about to move into an office that two boys have been living in every day for the last six years . " // As I wrapped things up , I noticed that the light drops falling outside had turned into a heavy rain . // I should have just walked out , since by then it was getting late . Instead , I wandered out of my office and through the building , stopping in the coaches ' locker room . Standing in the middle of the room , I let my gaze sweep over the cramped , worn twelve-by-fifteen room . I looked from locker to locker , reading some names , imagining others . // Monte Kiffin . Chris Foerster . Clyde Christensen . Rod Marinelli. // We had shared this locker room and many memories , these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years together . These men had walked off the frozen , concrete-hard synthetic turf in Philadelphia with me just two days earlier , their careers critically stung by the Bucs ' 31-9 loss . So much had been at stake for all of us-and the players too-yet the outcome had never really been in doubt . // It was a difficult season punctuated by a painful ending . // And now God had something different in mind for all of us. // I tried to take solace in the things we had accomplished together-three straight playoff appearances , more wins than any other staff in team history-but they seemed hollow , even within me . I stared at the lockers , the enormity of the moment suddenly overwhelming as I remembered names of guys long gone from my staff . // Lovie Smith . Herm Edwards . Mike Shula. // The prognosticators had been circling for weeks . And amid season-long rumors that a new head coach was being courted , their speculations had finally become reality . I had been fired . Many of the assistant coaches-maybe all of them-would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out fine . I knew that . But I also ached for the inevitable pain I knew they would face as they dealt with the uncertainty of their futures , that their children would face when they were uprooted from their schools , that their wives would face when ripped from their support systems . // Joe Barry . Mike Tomlin . Alan Williams . Jim Caldwell. // These men had just come that year . Why did they have to go ? It was hard to figure . My family had come to Tampa for a reason . God had led us here , opened doors that we did n't expect would be open , and allowed us to connect deeply with this community . But for what purpose ? // Not football , apparently . I felt certain that the Buccaneers were my best , and possibly last , chance to lead an NFL team . For whatever reason , God had closed the door . For what ? Possibly some sort of ministry . I was heavily involved in the All Pro Dad organization and Abe Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our church , Idlewild Baptist Central . Maybe God was trying to turn my focus toward those . // But did He have to close this door already ? // And close it so firmly ? // It really was hard to fathom . I had been faithful , had n't I ? So faithful in the mission that surely- surely - it was going to be blessed by Him . I had come here in 1996 with dreams of creating an organization based on values and character , and my staff and I had succeeded in doing just that . But God obviously wanted something else from me now . // It was n't really the firing itself that was a shock but rather the thought that God was allowing this great experiment to end . Had n't we tried to do things right ? // Oscar reappeared . It was late , approaching midnight . // I walked out , traversing a path between the squat racks , benches , and other weight-lifting machines in the weight area attached to the building . A cool mist blew in under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weight room was outside and open on its ends and side , but at least the Glazers , the Bucs ' owners , had partially covered it with a vinyl awning . Although the weights were cooled and heated-mostly heated-according to the daily whims of the southwest Florida climate , they were usually out of direct reach of the elements . // I looked to my left , past the row of squat racks and away from the building . Through the dark and rain , I could barely make out the two shadowy practice fields . The runway lights of the airport were clearly visible just yards beyond . // Where was the burning bush ? Where was that still , small voice ? Or , even better , the loud , booming one . // The only voice I could hear clearly was my own , crying out in the wilderness . When will I hear Your voice , Lord ? // I returned from my thoughts as Oscar quickly maneuvered between and around the weight machines to beat me to the next door . He pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain-link gate that separated the weight area and practice fields from the waiting parking lot . // * * * // The Bay News 9 reporter had been waiting all night for this shot . For two days , news trucks had been parked along the street , on the front lawn , in the surrounding ditches-wherever they could fit close to One Buc. // I thought everyone had abandoned the vigil hours earlier , when the Buccaneers had issued a statement that there would be a press conference the following morning . But on a hunch , this reporter had doubled back in the dark and rain , and he was about to hit the jackpot. // He must have seen my head over the dark green screen of the fence ; he began filming just as I carried the boxes through the gate and into the open area . He was across the street , sitting in the back of a news van on airport property , but given the narrow street and small parking area , he was no more than fifty feet away . The lens on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I walked directly toward him . // His nighttime footage of me would air repeatedly over the next several days . Everyone in the Tampa viewing area would have multiple opportunities to see Tony Dungy , former head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , placing boxes into his SUV in the pouring rain . // As I drove away from One Buc , I knew that my real and painful experience of being fired was an all-too-common part of the human condition in the young 21st century . I reminded myself that it was temporary . I took comfort in the knowledge that this , too , would pass . But my emotions were a mixture of peace and bewilderment with a swirl of unanswered questions . // What 's next ? What could we have done differently ? // I kept driving , across Columbus Drive and up Dale Mabry Highway . I went past Raymond James Stadium , where I 'd experienced so many highs . Fittingly , it was now empty . As I reached Bearss Avenue , I took a deep breath and let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on , that things would turn out all right professionally , that Lauren and the children were resilient enough to handle all of this . And it was obvious to me that God had something else for us , or He would n't have closed off what we were doing with the Bucs. // When will I hear Your voice , Lord ? Soon , I hope . // I knew everything would ultimately be fine , but at that moment-on that rain-swept night of January 14 , 2002-my Explorer and my spirits traveled under the same dark clouds . //
