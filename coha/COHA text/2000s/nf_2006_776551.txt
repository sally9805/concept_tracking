SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT // Medical Exploitation on the Plantation // Celia ? s child , about four months old , died last Saturday the 12th . This is two negroes and three horses I have lost this year . - DAVID GAVIN , 1855 // Frederick Gardiner , a peripatetic Mormon physician , left among his travel memoirs an impression of the nineteenth-century slave markets of Washington , D.C. : // There are a great number of Negroes , nearly all of whom are Slaves . And on different Streets are large halls occupied as Marts or stores , for the sale or purchase of Slaves . . . While I have been looking at one of these places on Gravier Street , Two Gentlemen have arrived , one of whom I have Seen in the Saloon , he is a young Planter and come to purchase a girl to take care of his children , or whatever duties he may think proper to impose upon her . The other person is a Doctor whom he has brought with him for the purpose of examining her . They pass along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Salesman . As they move forward One is called upon to stand up , then another while a passive examination is made . Then finally he discovers a bright mulatto , who appears about 16 years of age and is quite good looking . She is ushered into a private room where she is stripped to a nude condition and a careful examination is made of all parts of the body by the Dr. and is pronounced by him to be sound . The money is then paid and she is transferred to her new owner ? I have heard that the Masters beat and scourge them most cruelly . But I have not seen anything of the kind , nor do I believe that it occurs very often . For the southern people as a class are Noble minded kind hearted people , as can be found in any country ? And moreover it would be against their own interests , to brutally treat their Slaves . As no planter desired to have sick negroes on his hands . According to my judgment so far as my experience extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far more humanely treated and taken care of , Than are the laboring classes of European countries ( 1 ) . // Enslavement could not have existed and certainly could not have persisted without medical science . However , physicians were also dependent upon slavery , both for economic security and for the enslaved " clinical material " that fed the American medical research and medical training that bolstered physicians ? professional advancement . Gardiner ? s vignette suggests the integral role of medicine in enslavement and repeats a key belief  --  that slave owners and physicians shared an interest in preserving the slave ? s health , " as no planter desired to have sick negroes on his hands . " But although medicine was essential to enslavement , the apparent solicitude for the health of slaves was not all it seemed . Rather , the medical interests of the slave were often diametrically opposed to the interests of his owner and of American physicians . From the first , antagonism reigned between African Americans and their physicians . // Between the seventeenth-century advent of African settlers to North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave and the physician shared an unrecognizably primitive medical world . The " germ theory " that revealed the microbial nature of much disease and led to the first grand waves of disease cures was still well in the future : The existence of pathogens ( 2 ) such as bacteria , viruses , and fungi was unsuspected . Almost no effective treatments existed for prevalent diseases until the eighteenth century . Until the late 1830s , the lack of effective anesthesia made the few common surgical procedures horribly painful and all others impossible . // Between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries , medicine in the United States reflected a narrowly limited understanding of disease and a rather cursory training of medical practitioners . Public-health institutions were few , feeble , and ephemeral , rising momentarily with epidemics of yellow fever or smallpox and subsiding from neglect after the crisis resolved . Even the simplest public-health measures  --  hand washing and antiseptic techniques , clean water , sound , pathogen-free housing , an untainted food supply , sewage management , and quantitative disease reporting were all in the future . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotics , epidemics of yellow fever , malaria , tuberculosis , and other infectious diseases frequently raged unchecked . In the early 1700s , this mirrored the situation in England and the rest of Europe , but medicine on the Continent began to undergo modernizing changes , although these were very slow to cross the Atlantic . Europe began to embrace public-health measures and medical advances such as widespread vaccination , scientific medical education , and the rise of the hospital , but American progress lagged behind , especially in the insular South . // The point of this chapter ? s unflattering pr ? cis of nascent American medicine is not to castigate it for its primitivism , but to put blacks ? historical aversion to medical care into context , for most antebellum blacks were subjected to southern medicine . // The South was a particularly unhealthy region and was home to 90 percent of American blacks , the majority of whom were enslaved until 1865 . The first blacks arrived in the colonies in 1619 , and by 1700 there were only about 20,000 blacks . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Although 30 percent of transported slaves died in the nightmare of the Middle Passage , there were 550,000 chattel slaves in the United States by 1776 , when blacks constituted 20 percent of the U.S. population . By 1807 , slave importation was legally prohibited throughout the country , and by 1860 , the nation ? s four million enslaved blacks had a value equivalent to four billion dollars today . In some states , the black population completely comprised slaves : Alabama , for example , forbade the presence of free blacks . // The South was the nadir of the American medical experience , visited by a deadly triple confluence  --  the pathogens of North America , Europe , and Africa . This unholy trinity yielded a bewildering array of unfamiliar infectious diseases , such as hookworm , types of malaria , and yellow fever , incubated by a subtropical climate that was hospitable year-round to pathogens that could not thrive in the colder North . Even familiar European illnesses flared anew in strangely virulent forms , abetted by the hot , marshy climate , poor sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly visible affluent class , the region ? s relative poverty led to a dearth of medical care and a host of unrecognized nutritional-deficiency diseases . So did enslavement. // A dramatically misunderstood set of disease etiologies led to the adoption of heroic remedies calculated to kill or cure . Through the eighteenth century , Western medicine was not only misinformed but dangerously so . Caustic medicines of the period often contained metabolic poisons such as arsenic , or calomel , ( 3 ) a compound of mercury and chlorine that was used as a purgative . Many other remedies contained highly toxic substances such as mercury and addictive Schedule II narcotics , including the opiates laudanum , ( 4 ) opium , and morphine , as well as cocaine derivatives . These medicines addicted , sickened , or killed outright ; they also could trigger chemical pneumonitis , or progressive lung injury , if inhaled during a bout of iatrogenic , or physician-triggered , vomiting . No studies seem to have been done on this point , but such lung injuries may have helped to account for slaves ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an everyday event because the common denominator of medical techniques in this period was the violent release of bodily fluids . Copious bleeding , blistering , and the induction of violent diarrhea were standard therapies . Harsh laxatives or " draughts " such as calomel or jalap ( 5 ) produced copious diarrhea , which leached nutrients , water , and electrolytes from the body . They also invited painful bedsores , which were open to infection unchallenged by antibiotics . These crude therapies were not only unpleasant but debilitating to ill persons and even to the strong and healthy . Arsenic , for example , produced not only the intended vomiting and diarrhea but also a wide range of other problems , including fainting , heart disease , disorders of the nervous system , gangrene , and cancers ( 6 ) . Mercury ? s very serious effects included injury to the nervous system , profound mental deficits , hair and tooth loss , kidney and heart disease , lung injury , and respiratory distress . Mercury crossed the placental barrier and concentrated in breast milk , contributing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Such ministrations were often fatal . The 1799 death of George Washington , hastened by a copious bloodletting the debilitated former president could ill afford , is perhaps the best-known example of a patient finished off by the misguided heroics of eighteenth-century medicine . However , whites of the slave-owning class enjoyed better initial health , better nutrition , and less exposure to environmental pathogens and parasites than did enslaved blacks . Slave owners did not suffer from overwork and exposure , so they were better able than slaves to withstand the rigors of bloodletting . Sensing this , many physicians and scientists discouraged bloodletting for slaves . Thomas Jefferson , statesman and amateur physician-scientist , wrote unequivocally , " Never bleed a negro . " ( 8 ) But in their everyday practices , physicians didn ? t listen . Dr. Lunsford Yandell wrote , " On March 16 , 1833 I was called before sunrise to visit a Negro woman . I took from her twelve ounces of blood ? I waited about fifteen minutes when she had a severe convulsion . " ( 9 ) Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a partial vacuum that drew blood upward to the skin ? s surface or through an incision in the skin ) and trephination ( the therapeutic drilling of holes in the skull ) were risky for pampered , well-nourished adults living in relatively healthy environments . But they were fatal attentions for sickly , undernourished , and exhausted slaves and for their children , who were at even higher risk of succumbing to anemia or dehydration . // Enslaved African Americans were more vulnerable than whites to respiratory infections , thanks to poorly constructed slave shacks that admitted winter cold and summer heat . Slaves ? immune systems were unfamiliar with , or na ? ve to , microbes that caused various pneumonias and tuberculosis . Parasitic infections and abysmal nutrition also undermined blacks ? immunological rigor . Before antibiotics and sterile technique , surgery was an often-fatal affair . Unaware of the connection between bacteria and infection , surgeons operated in their street clothes and with dirty hands in filthy environments , such as the shacks that served as " slave hospitals . " Even minor incisions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Southern medicine of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was harsh , ineffective , and experimental by nature . Physicians ? memoirs , medical journals , and planters ? records all reveal that enslaved black Americans bore the worst abuses of these crudely empirical practices , which countenanced a hazardous degree of ad hoc experimentation in medications , dosages , and even spontaneous surgical experiments in the daily practice among slaves . // Physicians were active participants in the exploitation of African American bodies . The records reveal that slaves were both medically neglected and abused because they were powerless and legally invisible ; the courts were almost completely uninterested in the safety and health rights of the enslaved ( 10 ) . The practice of hiring slaves out further endangered enslaved workers by removing much of an employer ? s incentive to keep the slave healthy and safe . Some humane plantation owners were careful to choose less risky work venues , but a great danger of slave death or disability was inherent in some forms of mining , tobacco production , rice farming , and most plantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible death became part of his owner ? s commercial calculations . Ominously for blacks , the owners , not the enslaved workers , determined safety and rationed medical care , deciding when and what type of care was to be given . Because professional attention was expensive , most owners dosed their own slaves as long as they could before calling in physicians , who usually saw slaves only in extremis , as a last resort . In clinical notes , medical journals , and memoirs , physicians consistently decried the planters ? tendency to rely upon the cheaper ministrations of overseers , slaves , and mistresses in order to save expense . Physicians ? records also expressed disgust at the conditions in which enslaved workers were kept . Historian Richard Shryock observed in 1936 : " Of all critics , the Southern physician was perhaps in the best position to report on the physical and moral treatment of the slaves . When he stated , as he sometimes did , that Negroes were overworked and underfed , he can hardly be suspected of antislavery bias since he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , he usually approved of the institution . " ( 11 ) Planters ? own records and slave narratives corroborate physicians ? complaints that planters provided professional medical care only when they deemed it necessary to save the slave ? s life  --  often too late . // Owners also restricted access to medical care by routinely accusing sick blacks of malingering . Slave narratives and planters ? records reveal that an owner faced with a sick slave was likely to believe the illness was feigned . In her excellent and nuanced history , Working Cures : Healing Health and Power on Southern Slave Plantations , Sharla Fett describes how , in 1859 , slave owner William Massie resentfully recorded that his eighty-year-old slave " Patty " had just died " of I know not what disease ? She has been saying she was sick for near a year and always pretended to be sick . " No doctor was ever summoned to investigate , and not even Patty ? s death seems to have exonerated her from charges of malingering ( 12 ) . The enfeebled Patty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breeder , " so the nature of her sickness was inconsequential . // Owners relied upon doctors to tell them whether slaves were malingering , but physicians were less than objective . Dr.W . H. Taylor , called in consultation for an enslaved man , prefaced his assessment with the phrase " remembering that simulation was a characteristic of his race " ( 13 ) . Doctors and owners wrote articles in which they shared medical ruses and techniques calculated to get blacks , healthy or not , back into the fields . Dr. M. L.McLoud even wrote his master ? s thesis on the fraudulent illnesses of slaves ( 14 ) . He shared an incident in which he had accidentally administered an overdose of ammonium carbonate , ( 15 ) a corrosive white powder that was often used as smelling salts , to a slave shamming an epileptic fit . The burning sensation shocked her into abandoning her performance , and McLoud , like many other doctors , began to advocate such veiled medical violence when confronted with questionable illness in slaves ( 16 ) . But masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse . Thomas Chaplin wrote in his planter ? s journal , " Mary came out of the sick house today or rather was whipped out . " Owners and physicians also blurred the therapeutic line by referring jocularly to whipping as " medicine " for malingering slaves . One complaining woman was " treated with a cowskin or hickory switch to scourge her " emphasis added ; other doctors recommended that an owner apply " 9 drops of essence of rawhide " or " oil of hickory " ( 17 ) to the back of a sick slave . //
