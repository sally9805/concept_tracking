The Princess Diaries , Volumes I &; II : Mia Tells It Like It Is Volume One Chapter One Tuesday , September 23 Sometimes it seems like all I ever do is lie . My mom thinks I 'm repressing my feelings about this . I say to her , No , Mom , I 'm not . I think it 's really neat . As long as you 're happy , I 'm happy . Mom says , I do n't think you 're being honest with me . Then she hands me this book . She tells me she wants me to write down my feelings in this book , since , she says , I obviously do n't feel I can talk about them with her . She wants me to write down my feelings ? Okay , I 'll write down my feelings : I CA N'T BELIEVE SHE 'S DOING THIS TO ME ! Like everybody does n't already think I 'm a freak . I 'm practically the biggest freak in the entire school . I mean , let 's face it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freshman . How much more of a freak could I be ? If people at school find out about this , I 'm dead . That 's it . Dead.Oh , God , if you really do exist , please do n't let them find out about this . There are four million people in Manhattan , right ? That makes about two million of them guys . So out of TWO MILLION guys , she has to go out with Mr. Gianini . She ca n't go out with some guy I do n't know . She ca n't go out with some guy she met at D'Agostinos or wherever . Oh , no . She has to go out with my Algebra teacher . Thanks , Mom . Thanks a whole lot . Wednesday , September 24 , Fifth Period Lilly 's like , Mr. Gianini 's cool . Yeah , right . He 's cool if you 're Lilly Moscovitz . He 's cool if you 're good at Algebra , like Lilly Moscovitz . He 's not so cool if you 're flunking Algebra , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay after school EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY DAY from 2:30 to 3:30 to practice the FOIL method when you could be hanging out with all your friends . He 's not so cool if he calls your mother in for a parent/teacher conference to talk about how you 're flunking Algebra , then ASKS HER OUT . And he 's not so cool if he 's sticking his tongue in your mom 's mouth . Not that I 've actually seen them do this . They have n't even been on their first date yet . And I do n't think my mom would let a guy put his tongue in her mouth on the first date . At least , I hope not . I saw Josh Richter stick his tongue in Lana Weinberger 's mouth last week . I had this totally close-up view of it , since they were leaning up against Josh 's locker , which is right next to mine . It kind of grossed me out . Though I ca n't say I 'd mind if Josh Richter kissed me like that . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpha hydroxy for Lilly 's mom , and I noticed Josh waiting at the checkout counter . He saw me and he actually sort of smiled and said , Hey . He was buying Drakkar Noir , a men 's cologne . I got a free sample of it from the salesgirl . Now I can smell Josh whenever I want to , in the privacy of my own home . Lilly says Josh 's synapses were probably misfiring that day , due to heatstroke or something . She said he probably thought I looked familiar but could n't place my face without the cement block walls of Albert Einstein High behind me . Why else , she asked , would the most popular senior in high school say hey to me , Mia Thermopolis , a lowly freshman ? But I know it was n't heatstroke . The truth is , when he 's away from Lana and all his jock friends , Josh is a totally different person . The kind of person who does n't care if a girl is flat-chested or wears size-ten shoes . The kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of a girl 's soul . I know because when I looked into his eyes that day at Bigelows , I saw the deeply sensitive person inside him , struggling to get out . Lilly says I have an overactive imagination and a pathological need to invent drama in my life . She says the fact that I 'm so upset about my mom and Mr. G is a classic example . If you 're that upset about it , just tell your mom , Lilly says . Tell her you do n't want her going out with him . I do n't understand you , Mia . You 're always going around , lying about how you feel . Why do n't you just assert yourself for a change ? Your feelings have worth , you know . Oh , right . Like I 'm going to bum my mom out like that . She 's so totally happy about this date , it 's enough to make me want to throw up . She goes around cooking all the time . I 'm not even kidding . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . I had already opened the Suzie 's Chinese take-out menu , and she says , Oh , no cold sesame noodles tonight , honey . I made pasta . Pasta ! My mom made pasta ! She even observed my rights as a vegetarian and did n't put any meatballs in the sauce . I do n't understand any of this . Things to do 1 . Buy cat litter 2 . Finish FOIL worksheet for Mr. G 3 . Stop telling Lilly everything 4 . Go to Pearl Paint : get soft lead pencils , spray mount , canvas stretchers ( for Mom ) 5 . World Civ report on Iceland ( 5 pages , double space ) 6 . Stop thinking so much about Josh Richter 7 . Drop off laundry 8 . October rent ( make sure Mom has deposited Dad 's check ! ! ! ) 9 . Be more assertive 10 . Measure chest Thursday , September 25 In Algebra today all I could think about was how Mr. Gianini might put his tongue in my mom 's mouth tomorrow night during their date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked me a really easy question -- I swear , he saves all the easy ones for me , like he does n't want me to feel left out or something -- and I totally did n't even hear it . I was like , What ?
