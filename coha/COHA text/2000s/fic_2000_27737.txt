Place Cards " If I were to marry , I must expect to repent it . " Emma One month before her wedding to the third richest man in the second largest city in Ohio , Lily Blair awoke in the middle of the night and realized that she did not want to get married . This turn of events did not faze her mother , who regarded brief lapses of sanity as inevitable among young women on the brink of matrimony . Upon hearing the news the next day , Charlotte Blair scarcely looked up from her computer , which perched atop a table in the sunny yellow breakfast nook that she had converted into the war room for her daughter 's wedding . The screen displayed a dozen circles , each of which held eight rectangles , representing tables and place cards at the reception . " I 'm afraid that canceling the wedding is quite impossible , " she said . " The caterer 's deposit is nonrefundable . If you and Mark had wanted to elope like Todd and Isabelle , you should years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had married the woman who shared his apartment on the Avenue Victor Hugo . A photograph of the couple , holding hands in a field of lavender , stood on a shelf in the breakfast nook . Allowing her eye to rest on a row of white wicker baskets filled with fabric swatches and sample menus , Lily took a moment to steady herself . " I do n't want to elope , " she replied calmly . " I do n't want to get married at all . This is not about 350 veal medallions . This is about my life . " Charlotte Blair tapped a computer key , which caused a rectangle to dart from one circle to another . " Darling , do n't be melodramatic . It 's one of your least attractive characteristics . " " I 'm not being melodramatic . " " Oh , yes , you are . You 've always had a theatrical streak . I nearly died of embarrassment the year you insisted on dressing up as Ethel Rosenberg for Halloween . Every other child on the block was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Riding Hood . But you had to parade up and down the street with a sign that said , I WAS FRAMED . " " That 's how Mark and I got together , remember ? When we met at the fund-raiser for the museum , he told me he had defended Julius Rosenberg in a mock trial in the fifth grade . He said he knew it was fate when he learned that I had gone trick-or-treating as Ethel . " Charlotte Blair ignored the comment and returned to her daughter 's earlier point . " Anyway , what makes you think life is n't about veal medallions ? " she asked . " In your twenties you think life is about things like truth and beauty and the effects of acid rain on Micronesia . In your fifties you know it 's about what 's for dinner , should we renew the snow-removal contract , and do we still like the Hapwoods now that they 're divorced ? " " That 's exactly why I want to " " Now , tell me . Whom do n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favorite aunt and uncle of Lily 's fianc , Mark Slayton . They were also the most self-effacing members of a family that had attached its name to several streets , a shopping mall , and the head-injury wing of a distinguished teaching hospital . Lily knew no one who did not like them . " The Jensens speak to everybody , " she said , taken aback . " They might be the only people in Mark 's family who do . They even like their sadistic seven-year-old grandnephew who sets fire to the monogrammed cocktail napkins at every reunion . " " Nonsense . Everybody does n't speak to somebody . So everybody ca n't sit next to somebody at a wedding reception . Think , Lily . There must be somebody whom the Jensens have threatened to disinherit , or a former baby-sitter who claims that Ed played footsie with her under the table . " " I 've told you , " Lily said , " the wedding is off . The Jensens are n't going to be sitting next to anybody , because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved several more rectangles from one circle to another . Frowning , she studied the result as though she were Gary Kasparov contemplating an unsettling variation on the Sicilian defense . " This is absurd . All your life you 've envied your Grandmother Blair 's Audubon silver pattern . Now you have your own service for forty-eight , and you want to send it back . And what about that dreadful bathroom shower Mark 's sisters gave for you ? It was bad enough that you had to spend an afternoon opening rolls of toilet paper embossed with the Ohio State University seal . Think how embarrassing it would be to have to write notes returning them all . " " It wo n't be embarrassing . I 'll just send Penny and Fran notes saying , I 'm sorry to inform you that , now that my wedding is behind me , your toilet paper will never be . ' " " Lily , I do n't find this amusing . The final fitting for your dress was last weekend , the invitations have gone out and many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to joke about . " " I 'm not joking . " Her mother closed her eyes the way Lily had seen her do when she had come across one of Hieronymus Bosch 's paintings of hell in an art book . " You know that I have been under a great deal of stress because of this wedding . Please do n't add to it by telling me you are serious about calling the whole thing off . " " I 'm not trying to add to your stress . I 'm trying to end it by telling you that you will never again have to worry about whether you should have ordered the cassis instead of the Grand Marnier sorbet as a palate cleanser , because three hundred and fifty palates will no longer need cleansing . " Lily 's mother turned away from her World of Weddings software program without rising from her chair . " I knew I should have insisted that you get a Valium prescription from Dr. Burns , " she said gloomily . " No bride in her right mind ever approached her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tranquilizers have made to the human race . Tess Mahoney has been married three times and says she would never have made it through any of her engagements if she had n't kept a Valium tucked into her bra for emergencies . Let me call Dr. Burns and see if he can prescribe one over the phone . " " My generation does n't take Valium . We 're the flag-bearers of Prozac Nation . But I do n't need a tranquilizer . " " Then you need a drink . The trouble with your generation is that you 've never come to terms with the value of a properly mixed martini . " Lily shook her head . Much as she disagreed with her mother , she envied her simple pietistic faith in the things she saw as the underpinnings of civilization , such as the sterling silver vermouth dropper . " A drink wo n't help any more than a Valium will . And you 'd be surprised at how many members of my generation drink martinisthey 're back in style now . " Charlotte Blair looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the pink-and-white geraniums along a footpath from the terrace to the backyard , where the reception was supposed to take place under a huge tent . Despite an underground sprinkler system and a gardener who came twice a week , the flowers were browning at the edges . " This heat " she began , then turned abruptly toward her daughter . " Wait ! It 's the heat , is n't it ? The heat wave is making you act this way . Nobody likes living in an apartment without air-conditioning in weather like this . But if that 's the problem you can move back into your old bedroom here until " " Mother , you do n't call off a wedding because you live in an un-air-conditioned apartment . " " Then why do you call it off ? " " Because I do n't want to get married . " " Nonsense . Every woman wants to get married . " " I 'm not every woman , and I 'm not ready to commit to settling down with Mark and spending the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with Colony Heights ? You did n't complain about it when you were playing tennis at the club every day , or giving parties in a backyard ten times the size of that overpriced garret you had in New York . " Lily knew that she would only enrage her mother by admitting that she found Colony Heights a stodgy and oppressive suburb of a dismal Rust Belt city that had never recovered from the collapse of its manufacturing base . She decided to tell the least disputable version of the truth . " What 's wrong with Colony Heights ? The weather . You always said I do n't look good in gray , and the only sunny days we seem to have in this part of Ohio come in the middle of droughts like the one we 're having now . " " So you admit that the heat is getting to you . " " No , I do n't . I 'm only saying that , if bad weather were a federal offense , Colony Heights would be the Jimmy Hoffa of suburbs . Racketeering charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , you would rather live someplace like New York , where you have to take an elevator up to the roof to see the sky . " " I did n't say that . " " But you thought it . " Lily considered how to respond to this . She loved New York and had returned to Colony Heights only because her current employer , the Daily Rectifier , had recruited her when her New York paper was rumored to be about to fold . At that vulnerable moment , she convinced herself that unemployment might be worse than going back to a city in which a councilman 's wife once turned down an invitation to the White House because it conflicted with her cha-cha lessons . So she had shelved her misgivings about working for a paper whose name reflected that bizarre form of Midwestern optimism that cast anything short of a nuclear holocaust as a temporary setback . She had never intended to stay at the Daily forever and , until she became engaged to Mark , had been planning to look for a New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . But she could hardly say this without at once offending her mother and conceding her point . " I did n't come here to talk about New York , " she said evenly . " I came here to talk about my wedding . " Charlotte Blair toyed with a swatch of fabric from the gown of one of Lily 's bridesmaids , then looked sharply at her daughter . " Sally put you up to this , did n't she ? " Lily had chosen Sally Levin , a police reporter she had worked with in New York , as her maid-of-honor despite the vehement objections of her mother , who believed that respectable women did not earn their living interviewing convicted felons . Charlotte Blair tossed the fabric swatch back into its wicker basket . " I must have been out of my mind to let you have a maid-of-honor who is probably going to come to the wedding on the arm of a serial killer . " " Mother , they do n't let you out of Sing Sing so you can do the Bunny Hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't date her sources . It 's a journalistic conflict-of-interest . " Lily glanced at a box of ecru envelopes lined with tissue paper . " Now , do you think we could have a sensible discussion about how to recall all the wedding invitations ? " " How can we have a sensible discussion about such a silly idea ? Do you know how many women would love to marry someone who has just been ranked the third richest man in the city by its leading financial journal ? " " Are you saying I should marry Mark because he is rich ? You did n't marry Daddy for his money . " Lily saw an odd look cross her mother 's face , a strange mix of guilt and regret . An alarming silence fell between them . Charlotte Blair took a sip of Armagnac from the crystal snifter next to her computershe viewed martinis as a predinner drinkand avoided Lily 's gaze . " Mark is more than rich , " she said , choosing her words the way she picked over cherries for clafoutis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he is also handsome , charming , and a partner in the largest law firm in the city . Frankly , I think you should give serious thought to the likelihood thatif you do n't marry Markyou will be making the biggest mistake of your life . " " I have given serious thought to it , and I think I may be making the biggest mistake of my life if I do marry Mark . That 's why I 'm not going through with the wedding . " Her mother took another sip of Armagnac . She looked at Lily the way a doctor might examine a patient whose electrolyte levels had gone through the roof but who showed no outward symptoms of disease . " All right , " she said wearily . " Tell me what you want . Buffalo chicken wings instead of veal medallions at the wedding reception ? You can have the chicken wings . I 'd rather pay a little more to change the menu than lose the caterer 's deposit altogether . " " I said , this is not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridesmaids ' lineup ? I 'll talk to Aunt Grace . She 'll be hurt , but she 'll be over it by the time you and Mark have your first child . " Lily looked at her mother in disbelief . For someone who owned eight pairs of white gloves and a set of pearl-handled fish knives , the woman could be ruthless . " Libby 's not fat . She 's just a muscular field hockey player . Besides , I like her . I would n't exclude somebody from my wedding party just to make the pictures look better . " " Your dress , then ? I noticed that you looked a little queasy at the bridal salon the other day , but I thought the fitter might have stuck you with a pin . " In fact , Lily had not decided to call off the wedding because of her gown . She had not consciously decided to do anything but had simply awakened at 3 A.M. knowing that she could not go through with the ceremony . The idea had resembled a revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from what she at first had wanted that she had come to see it as a symbol of all that she was trying to escape . Since becoming engaged she had felt that her life was rushing forward without her , driven by the self-propelled engine of her approaching marriage . She measured the distance lost in the yards of billowy white tulle gathered into the train of her wedding gown . At the age of seven , she had been a flower girl at the wedding of her Aunt Grace , who had married in her mid-thirties in an intimate ceremony in a friend 's rose garden . The bride had worn a wisp of a dress , in the palest of pinks instead of white , and carried a nosegay of violets . Lily was enchanted . If she married , she thoughtifshe would want the kind of day her Aunt Grace had . Instead her wedding had turned into a production number that might have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley , the Mormon Tabernacle choir , and a graduate school of restaurant management . Her parents could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand out at the church . Worse , the more lavish the wedding had become , the bigger the dress it had seemed to require , until Lily found herself being fitted for a gown suitable for the bride of a Crown Prince of Luxembourg . Which , in turn , called for a cathedral-length veil and a bouquet so large , her father joked that the florist might have to lower it into her arms with a forklift . Despite all this , Lily said that her dress was not an issue . This was more or less true , now that it would never leave the bridal salon . " But if you 're not upset about your reception or your bridesmaids , or your gown , this does n't make any sense , " her mother replied , getting up from her chair and beginning to pace . " Every time I talk to Isabelle , she tells me how much she wishes she 'd had a big wedding like yours . " " Isabelle also votes Socialist , lets five-year-old Sylvie drink from her wineglass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved by the establishment of topless beaches up and down the East Coast . Would you want me to take her advice on those things , too ? " Her mother dismissed the comment with a wave of the hand that did not hold her Armagnac snifter . " Isabelle ca n't help it if she 's a Trotskyite exhibitionist who views Chteau Latour as a health food . The French have these things in their blood . You had the best American upbringing that money could buy . And yet you 've been saying since you were a girl that you did n't want to get married " " And I still " " You would n't even play with bride dolls . It broke my heart when you showed no interest in that beautiful porcelain bride your father and I bought you in Copenhagen , with its own rhinestone tiara . But I said nothing , because I knew you 'd get over it when you met the right man . Now you 've met the right man , and you 're still acting like a child . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature thing I 've ever done . " " How can you do this to me ? " " I 'm not doing it to you . I 'm doing it for me . " " You may think that now , but you 'll regret it later . " " If I regret it later , I can marry Mark later . " Her mother acted as though she said she could buy the Astrodome later . " Do you think you can expect a man like Mark to wait around until you recover from whatever has come over you ? " " Why not ? Is n't that what women do all the time for men ? " " Do n't bring Gloria Steinem into this , " her mother snapped . " She puts ideas in people 's heads . " Lily did not know how to respond to this . " Even if you do n't care what I think , have you no respect for your grandmother ? " her mother continued . " She will never get over this . The whole time she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be able to walk down the aisle at your wedding . Now that she 's back on her feet again , I have to hit her with this . " " You do n't have to hit her with anything , " Lily said . " I 'll talk to her . " She paused . " Where is Gran , anyway ? " " She 's in Maine with Mr. Brooks . " Lily 's paternal grandmother lived in a mother-in-law wing of the Blairs ' stately neo-Georgian home when she was not traveling . She had met Austin Brooks several years after becoming widowed and , since then , had taken almost all of her vacations with him . Much as she envied her grandmother 's energy and independence , Lily wished that she had not chosen such a moment to spend on a weather-beaten island accessible only by ferry . She had always found her grandmother to be her fearless champion in her battles with her mother . " I do n't think you 're giving Gran enough credit , " Lily said . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be undone by my violating the mating rituals of a tribe that wears belts with spinnakers on them . " Lily instantly regretted the unkindness of the remark about the spinnakers and tried to soften its impact . " Remember when I was eleven and polled everybody in the family about how old a girl she should be before she started dating ? " she asked . " Most people said , Thirteen . ' Gran said , Thirty . ' " Ignoring the comment , her mother looked across the room toward the Regency carriage clock on the breakfront . " None of this would have happened if your father had n't gone to his club tonight . He would tell you how selfishly you are behaving . " " He ca n't change my mind on this one . This does n't involve him . " " But it does involve Mark . May I ask what he thinks of all this ? " Lily felt slightly flustered . " Well , actually , he does n't know yet . He 's in California trying that big age-discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him as soon as he returns . But it just did n't seem right to break the news to him over the telephone and in the middle of a trial that 's so important to his firm . " " You came all the way over here to tell me about something that Mark is only going to talk you out of anyway ? " " He is n't going to talk me out of this . " " You always say that Mark can talk anybody into anything , and it 's true . That man could talk the double-glazing off a storm window . That 's why he 's such a successful lawyer . " " Might I have some credit for being able to resist his extraordinary powers ? " " You did n't resist when he gave you a diamond the size of a sweet potato . " Lily blinked . " I did n't ask for a diamond the size of a sweet potato . A five-carat ring was Mark 's idea . " " But you did n't reject it any more than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's eyes met . Lily sat very still as an idea took shape in her mind . " Would you like to see me reject this ring ? " she asked . " All right , I 'll show you I can do it . " Lily walked into the kitchen , took a dish towel off a hook near the Aga , and hung her ring in its place . " I 'm going to leave this here as a reminder that you are not going to see me walk down the aisle of Holy Family Cathedral a month from now . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't do it . " Charlotte Blair shut off her computer and walked to the window overlooking the yard in which her daughter 's reception was to take place . She had just written a five-figure check to have the lawn resodded for the wedding . " Oh , God , " she said . " This is why I wanted only boys . "                @ @ @ @ @
