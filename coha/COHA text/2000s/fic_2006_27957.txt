Wolf at the Door A novel of The Others By Warren , Christine St. Martin 's Paperbacks Warren , Christine Honeysuckle . The idiot attorney in the gray suit continued to natter on about something useless -- -the most beneficial way to structure a retirement portfolio or some such rot -- -but Sullivan Quinn had long since tuned it out . The hair on the back of his neck bristled to attention . His muscles tensed and his nostrils flared as he drank in the tormenting fragrance . Somewhere in this snugly elegant club , among these rooms full of werefolk and vampires , witches and magic-users , in the middle of a January cold snap , he could smell the sweet , elusive scent of honeysuckle vines . And it was driving this particular werewolf out of his bloody mind . " ... lost it when the dot-com bubble burst , " short , bald , and boring continued . " Really knocked me for a loop . I did n't have a bite for nearly three days . " Quinn made some sort of not even remotely sympathetic sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped around , light brown eyes no doubt glowing in reflection of his intensity . He scanned the area thoroughly and tried to suppress a growl when he did n't see an obvious source of the fragrance . It called to him , a sweet heady beacon of femininity , fertility , and fuckability . His three favorite f-words . Maybe he 'd been too long without a lover , or maybe his family was right and his hormoneswere telling him he was getting too old not to have a mate . Then again , maybe he 'd just been sent round the bend by the corrupting influence of New York City . Whatever it was , all he knew was that he wanted that honeysuckle . What he would n't give just then to be back among his own pack , where he could order the bright , intoxicating flowers brought to him like tribute . Okay , so maybe that was a bit much . As guth of his pack , Quinn lacked the ultimate authority of Alpha , but he made up for it with a freedom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alpha because of his power , they looked up to the guth because of the scope of his responsibilities . After all , in addition to being the pack 's ambassador and negotiator , the guth was the keeper of its traditions , its histories , and its stories . He was the pack 's living link to its past , as well as their insurance of a favorable future . So they might not have brought him the honeysuckle as tribute , but they would at least have let him end his current conversation without giving the impression of terminal rudeness . " Oh , I got over it , of course . Drank three pints straight from the bags before I was fit company again , " the charismaless wonder said , peppering his delivery with a few smug chuckles . " That 'll teach this old vamp a new trick or two . You 'll never catch me on another starvation diet ! " Quinn ignored the man 's forced joviality -- -which , coming from a vampire who looked like Oliver Hardy , frankly creeped him out -- -and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the last forty seconds , it had become the most important goal in his universe . Never mind that he 'd flown from Ireland not two days ago to represent his country at a critical international meeting of Others , staking the honor of himself and his pack on his abilities as a diplomat . Bollocks to that . He needed those flowers . " . . . portfolio had been cursed by some old Cuban woman I bumped into at the market . Cost a fortune to have a witch break the spell , but since then things seem to be picking up steam . I 've been quite pleased . " The small part of Quinn 's brain that had n't been commandeered to join the search team allowed him to respond with an eloquent grunt . Then Quinn inhaled another hint of honeyed blossoms , and that last holdout joined the search . The Emperor of Ennui paused for breath and swirled his glass of watered-down bourbon . " But that 's enough about me -- - " " Yes , " Quinn agreed . The hell with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like giving in to the compulsion to follow his nose and leaving Sir Stultifying to yammer away at thin air . He wove his way through the crowd of people gathered to welcome him and his fellow European representatives to America , ignoring every single one of them . Right then and for the first time in his life , he did n't care about his standing in diplomatic circles , about the long history of his family as ambassadors among the Others , about his reputation as a man who helped ease the way of his people into the future while keeping alive the stories of their traditions past . Bugger all of that . He ignored the men who knew him and the women who wanted to and the important figures he 'd come all this way to meet . He kept his attention focused straight ahead and followed the beckoning tendril of scent like a man in the desert followed a mirage . Single-mindedly . And hungrily . He forgot about being a dignitary , forgot about being a guest , even forgot about being an Irishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the very thing that made him good at his job was that he always kept his cool , no matter how provoking the circumstances . He 'd never have made an effective guth otherwise . Yet here he was , and there his cool went . He continued to wonder about it even as the lingering scent drew him like a ring through his nose among the crowds that milled in the hall . There seemed to be folk everywhere , walking in and out of rooms , talking , laughing , and interacting with a tranquillity that the uninitiated might have found astonishing . After all , in a room full of predators , someone usually had to be the prey . At one time that might have been true , and on more than one occasion Quinn had longed to return to the old ways -- -usually after settling a mind-numbingly unimportant dispute between packs . But just as the humans had evolved from Vikings to crusaders to frantic missile-defense builders , so too had the Others of the world evolved . They 'd learned many centuries ago that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting them as well . For some , a common enemy made for as solid a truce as a common goal . For once , though , Quinn 's mind was not on the politics of truces or enemies or common goals . It was n't on the advice his father had given him the day he 'd taken over as guth : Always keep his wits about him , no matter what the distraction , no matter how strong the temptation . No , every brain cell he had , be it manly or bestial , had fixed on the sunshine yellow of honeysuckle flowers and the sweet taste of their nectar . He needed a sip . Now . The mysterious scent maddened him , strong one moment , fleeting the next . Bloody hell , less than forty-eight hours in the country and he 'd already developed an obsession . No wonder his pack had jokingly told him New York City would drive a good Irishman mad . They could be right . Up . Upupup . His gaze shot toward the ceiling , as if he expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chandeliers . Instead , he blinked up at lovely , white plasterwork like a drooling moron . " Quinn . " He grunted something unintelligible -- -well , unintelligible to all but another Lupine -- -and continued to stare . " Quinn ! " The growl in that repetition got his attention , and Quinn lowered his gaze from the ceiling of the main hall of the Vircolac Club to the curious face of Tobias Walker , a master of bad timing and representative of his host pack , the Silverback Clan . From the moment of their first meeting thirtysome hours before , they 'd fallen into the easy and insulting rapport of good friends or bad brothers . Tobias raised an eyebrow . " If you 're looking for the security cameras , buddy , you 're not going to find them . Logan Hunter installed them himself before he moved up north . The security here is top-notch . " " Fascinating , I 'm sure , " Quinn said , closing his eyes and inhaling deeply . " But I 'm really rather busy at the moment , Walker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend my ear as long as you please . Now , if you 'll excuse me -- - " He had barely turned toward the stairs before Tobias caught his shoulder and spun him back around . " Not so fast , Quinn . I did n't come over here to chat about the weather . I 'm playing messenger . " Quinn barely paused . " Then tell your message-giver that I 'm unavailable for the next little while , will you , boyo ? I 've more important things to see to at the moment . " " Afraid I ca n't do that , pal . This is business . " Shite . Quinn bit back the curse . Of all the bloody times for someone to remind him of his duties . It served as yet more proof that God must hate him . " What type of business ? " " The type you came here for . " Just then , Quinn spotted the stairway , half-concealed around a corner , and wanted to howl at the injustice . He knew that was where the honeysuckle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a minute , someone was going to dangle a raw porterhouse in front of his nose and then tell him it was n't time for dinner . He just knew it . He rounded on Tobias , eyes blazing with frustration . " D' you think you might be a tad more specific , lad ? " " Lad ? What the hell has gotten into you ? " Tobias paused only long enough to hear Quinn 's snarl before he snapped back . " Whatever it is , do n't bite the messenger , Cujo . Adele Berry has asked to meet you . " The name pierced Quinn 's distraction . " Berry ? She sounds familiar , but I can't -- - " " She holds a seat on the Council 's Inner Circle . " " Shitepissbollocksfuck . " " That 's the spirit . " Tobias clapped one hand on the other man 's shoulder and turned him back toward the club 's enormous ballroom . The room he 'd just left . Because it was in the opposite direction of his honeysuckle flowers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just gon na love her . " Grinding his teeth to sand , Quinn shrugged the hand off his shoulder and headed resentfully in the indicated direction . " Certainly I will . I can tell from the sugared tone of your voice that I shall treasure this experience for all time . " " You 'll certainly remember it for all time . No one forgets their first meeting with Dame Adele . " " Dame Adele ? " Glancing briefly backward , Quinn caught the uncomfortable expression that passed across Tobias 's face . " Yeah , " the American said , " you might not want to call her that . . . you know , to her face . " " Why , thank you , Tobias . I 'm not certain I would have worked that one out for myself . " " I 'm here to help . " " And why do n't you help yourself to a silver suppository , you supercilious Yank bast -- - " " Good evening , young man . " If Quinn clenched his teeth any harder , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning his back to the Lupine he 'd like to strangle , he blew out a slow breath and pasted a charming smile on his face for the small , elegant woman seated before him . After all , she might have bad timing , but business was business . " Ma'am , " he said , taking her frail , soft hand in his and evaluating her at a glance . She had the look of an aged Audrey Hepburn and the bearing of Queen Victoria . " Sullivan Quinn . I 'm honored to be making your acquaintance . " " Indeed , Mr. Quinn , I know quite well who you are . " She had the imperious tone used only by royalty or three-year-olds . Even he would be hard-pressed to match her for arrogance . " I am Adele Berry , one of the organizers of this little soire and of your visit here to the United States . I know everything there is to know about you . " Quinn straightened to his full height and fought to keep his hackles from rising . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up until the day he could best them in a fight . " Now that would be an impressive achievement , ma'am , and one I 'd be curious to know the trick of . " She stared at him from surprisingly dark and canny eyes . " I did n't get to be where I am by revealing my tricks , Mr. Quinn . Nor did I ask the Silverback to introduce us so we could make small talk about your ignorance . " His breath hissed in so loudly , he knew she must have heard it . She just chose to ignore it . " I required an introduction , " she said , straightening her impeccable posture even further , hands folded delicately over the handle of a silver-hilted cane . " I required an introduction because I want to know if the rumors I 've heard about your planned speech before the Council might possibly be true . " Quinn bit back an impatient retort and searched for a conciliatory answer . When that did n't work , he searched for civility . " As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York two short days ago , I ca n't speculate on the truth of them , ma'am . " " Kindly do not play word games with me , young man . I asked you a question , and I expect a direct and concise answer . " At any other time , he would have been amused by this old woman with an attitude from hell and the manners to match , but not tonight . His nerves were on edge , his trousers were tightening , his mind was distracted , and his beast was yanking at the reins in an attempt to get free and get to the source of the floral sweetness in the air . " No , you did n't , ma'am . You issued a command , which I 'm sure is something you 're quite accustomed to doing , but to which I am not accustomed to responding . " He watched those dark eyes narrow and struggled to keep the snarl off his face . No matter what his instincts screamed , this woman was not issuing him a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of Lupine society , even if Lupine society would have allowed him to pin her to the floor and clamp his teeth around her jugular . " Young man , I am a member of the Council of Others . " She fairly radiated elegant outrage , but Quinn remained unswayed . The anger of being torn from his flower hunt helped sustain his resistance . " I have been weighing the fate of the folk in this city for more than fifty years , be they shifter or vampire , witch or changeling . I am an elder in this community , and I am entitled to an answer . I am entitled to know if you will announce to the Council that your delegation is planning to reveal the existence of our kind to human society . " " With all due respect , ma'am , you will have that answer the minute I give it before the Council . " " I am not inclined to wait ! " " And I am not inclined to humor an old woman with inflated senses of entitlement ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop it , though his teeth clacked together in the attempt . That quite likely had n't been the wisest move of his political career . He had spent a lot of time before flying to the United States finding out everything he needed to know about the Council of Others , and he 'd read several indications that Adele Berry and the Council were twined together tighter than braided silk . For more than four decades , her voice had influenced the body that governed the activities of every nonhuman citizen of the greater Manhattan and tristate areas . She was not a woman to dismiss lightly . Quinn took a deep breath and tried again . This was not one of his pack , he reminded himself as he attempted to pry his jaws apart . In fact , she was n't even Lupine ; he could smell that much . Actually , he thought , pausing to inhale , she smelled -- - " Young man . . . "  - -  - like rose and earth and the faintest trace of warm honeysuckle vines . Honeysuckle . Quinn froze , nose locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deeply . Fresh , sweet honeysuckle . Ripe and rich and ready to be fucked -- -PLUCKED , he corrected himself , ready to be plucked . " Young man , I demand an explanation of this discourtesy ! " Adele 's voice rang brittle and strident in his ears , and he could n't have cared less . One more , deep sniff told him his honeysuckle flower had been here before she disappeared . She had been near this woman , maybe even hugged her , and her scent led directly away from the grande dame and toward the hallway stair . " Pardon , " he growled , already turning and moving toward the door . " It 's the Irish in me . Not a civilized bone in our bodies . Ask a Brit . " He did n't stick around to see her jaw snap shut , but he would n't have cared if he had . He was too busy licking his chops and grinning the grin of a big , bad wolf . A wolf with a taste for honey . Continues ... by Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
