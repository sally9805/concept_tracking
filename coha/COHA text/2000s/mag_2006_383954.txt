Is it possible to look sophisticated and modern in this youthful staple ( summer 's It piece ) ? With the right wardrobe pairings , we say yes . // I love shorts . With flip-flops and T-shirts . In fact , I love shorts so much , I have a recurring fantasy of moving to Harbour Island in the Bahamas or the like , leaving behind my New York wardrobe and living in the aforementioned basics . To me shorts represent the ultimate in casual . They are so laid-back , they are almost antifashion . This season , however , designers have deemed shorts the ultimate in chic . Zac Posen sent leggy Carmen Kass out in a pair of rolled-up taupe linen shorts with a metal-sequined bolero ; at Bottega Veneta , Tomas Maier put a serious belted leather jacket with a pleated pair ; and at Gucci , Frida Giannini worked a multitude of satiny black Bermudas with silk blouses and snug little jackets . ( Giannini herself strutted out in the look when she took her bow at the end of the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knit vest and a chiffon shirt , Thakoon had fluttery short shorts perfect for Hollywood 's starlets , and Marc Jacobs , who went all-out ' ' 80s for Louis Vuitton , had Desperately Seeking Susan color-blocked biker shorts with a belted safari-style jacket . There were no flip-flops , just high-heeled sandals and wedges . And have you noticed that some very chic women-Gwyneth Paltrow , Charlize Theron , and Jennifer Aniston-are forgoing cocktail frocks and sundresses in favor of shorts for day and night ? Shorts are officially moving beyond resortwear to become a warm-weather staple . But why are they having a moment ? " Shorts reflect a new way of dressing . A piece of clothing once seen as practical now has a more contemporary sense of glamour , sexiness , and freedom , " explains Giannini . " Shorts are extremely versatile , " says Andrew Gn , who showed some of the most elegant shorts suits to be found . " For me the shorts suit is the new pantsuit . " But before you decide to run out to lunch in tennis shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting that exercise clothes have become acceptable everyday attire , and no one is asking you to bare a lot of leg . For most of us , in fact , a good amount of coverage is a social obligation . " Short , sexy numbers , " says Beth Buccini , co-owner of New York City 's Kirna Zabte , " are only for the brave and the perfectly fit 20-year-olds . Otherwise they can be too Richard Simmons . " If you have any doubt about wearing a pair of Stella McCartney short shorts out at night with heels , then do n't . But a Bermuda short that hovers around the knee can look great as long as you have decent legs ( and a bottle of self-tanner ) , choose the right cut , and accessorize accordingly . Cut is everything . As my friend puts it , " You do n't want to look like a camp counselor . " Billowy , baggy shorts are best reserved for hiking . Pleats can be okay , but look for something trim and tailored . And chic shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great pairs from Juicy Couture , Club Monaco , and even Gap if you want to try the trend . But once you have your shorts , what goes with them ? " There is no age factor for the shorts suit , " says Gn . " As long as you have nice legs and can bear wearing heels-preferably four and a half inches-you 'll look chic . " Because shorts have had such a loungewear reputation , the right shoe is crucial . ( Bermudas + flip-flops = the beach . You get the picture . ) On the runways heels seem to be the accessory that gives shorts that coolness . But heels are not the only answer . Remember , runways are where designers live out their fantasies ; they do n't ask the models to chase 4-year-olds down the street in five-inch stilettos . Even fashion diehard Tracey Ross , owner of the eponymous L.A. boutique/celeb hangout , believes heels are n't always right . " For day pair Bermudas with loafers or flat sandals . If you 're going to lunch , a platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing it . At night wear shorts with platforms ; they make your legs look longer . " Ankle-strap heels are good for evening , but pumps are a no-go : " It looks trashy , like you 're going to Las Vegas , " says Ross . Once you 've got the shoes down , tops need careful consideration . Proportion is key . " Team shorts with a cotton blouse or a casual jacket for day , " says Gn , " or a beaded jacket or blouse for the evening . " Word to the wise : Your typical shorts and T-shirt combo is way too laid-back and cheesy with heels ; a racer-back tank with a glitzy flat sandal , a loafer , or a ballet flat , however , looks sleek . And a little cashmere T-shirt is a nice idea . But my favorite pairing is something blousy with a Bermuda short , because the fullness on top gives the illusion of slimness at the bottom . A cropped jacket or vest is very cool , very Kate Moss-if you can pull it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done Bermudas and flats ( actually flip-flops ) every summer since I can remember , I decided to try out a wedge and Bermuda combo when I was in Florida . I was dying for the silk shantung Chloe Bermudas , but they had n't hit the stores yet ; so I settled for my old white cotton ones from Banana Republic ( which are still pretty good , I must say ) and a pair of Michael Kors wedge espadrilles . On top I wore a breezy Indian shirt and a chunky coral necklace . I felt a little awkward when I went to the beach club to have lunch , but also somewhat glamorous in that " I wear heels with my bikini " way . Still , I 'm not convinced about shorts with heels . But the bigger question is , Can I make it work in the city ? Worth Avenue is one thing , but Madison Avenue ? I 'm not sure the matre d ' at 21 will let me pass through the front door no matter how much I chic up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a chunky Chloe platform and a black chiffon halter top from Moschino do make for a fun cocktail option that I am up for trying . When it 's dark out , there 's less light to scrutinize the legs . And I like the idea of running around-picking up the kids or even shopping-in those Chloe Bermudas , a J. Crew cashmere shell , and some ornate flats . Maybe I 'd even wear that outfit to work . ( Note : Do n't try this if your office does not allow open-toe sandals or bare legs . ) It 's sporty , easy , and elegant . And probably the closest I 'll ever get to living out my Harbour Island dream .
