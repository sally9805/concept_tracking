<p> The sins of Jim Fowler 's youngest son were not exceptionally wicked . Joyriding in a stolen Mercedes . Ditching school . Running away . Things certain kids do in sleepy towns waiting for their lives to begin , for something , anything , to happen . <p> " He was a good kid , " says his haunted father . " God dang , he was a lot of fun . " <p> He was also in a lot of scrapes with juvenile authorities . All of them " dumb , " his dad said , like stealing a car . But when he surveys the past looking for signposts to his son 's death sentence , he always comes back to this : Mark was never violent . <p> The miseries of Jim Fowler stretch 16 years . Two sons dead , one by execution . His elderly mother raped and murdered . And his family devastated not once , but twice by the testimony of Joyce Gilchrist , an expert witness for the prosecution . <p> The tribulations of the Fowlers began with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blundered over the line separating crimes that get you jail time and crimes that get you executed . Even now , no one really knows why . <p> On July 3 , 1985 , at 3 a.m. , Mark and a loser named Billy Ray Fox pulled up to an IGA grocery store . <p> Mark Fowler barely knew the guy ; they 'd met only four days earlier . Fox had a plan to make easy money . All he needed was a little help . <p> So after smoking pot and swallowing pills , they staggered into Fox 's pickup and went to the market where Fox had been recently fired . <p> The former employee had a deal with the night manager . A bag of money , skimmed from the cash registers , would be waiting . <p> In their drugged stupidity , neither phoned to see if their accomplice was working . <p> He was n't . And right there , Mark Fowler crossed the line . <p> The entire night shift , three men ranging in age from 27 to 44 , were ordered face-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with a 16-gauge shotgun . The third was beaten until the shotgun stock cracked , then stabbed to death . <p> Mark Fowler later said he stood lookout , and when he heard the shots from the back of the store , he went and sat in Fox 's truck . Fox came out minutes later and threw the single-action shotgun on Fowler 's lap , Mark told his father . <p> The murder evidence against Mark Fowler was circumstantial but the jury believed it . <p> The police department 's forensic expert testified that hair found on one victim 's shirt and on the murder weapon matched Fowler 's . It showed , Gilchrist said , that he had been in the storage room . <p> Mark Fowler died by injection this past January , two days before Billy Ray Fox . <p> " They did n't have to kill my boy , " his father said , sobbing . " They wanted to kill him . " <p> Jim Fowler is a tall man with a big laugh . His rough hands reach out to people he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his warm and folksy voice carries stories about Mark without cracking . Sometimes it simply breaks . <p> " I can not change what my son did . He went up there to get money dishonestly , " he says . " But he told us from day one that he did n't kill anybody . " <p> Gilchrist painted a different picture . The star witness at Mark Fowler 's murder trial has helped put 11 men to death in a state that has more executions per capita than any other , according to a recent survey by Amnesty International . <p> But her testimony , spanning 13 years and hundreds of cases , is under investigation by the state , an organization of defense lawyers , the police department and the district attorney 's office . <p> Her career began to unravel in May , when Oklahoma was forced to release Jeffery Todd Pierce , who served 15 years of a 65-year sentence for a rape he did n't commit . Recent DNA testing proved Pierce 's semen did n't match that found in the victim . <p> Gilchrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She refused to be interviewed for this story . In earlier statements , she has denied any wrongdoing . <p> " I feel comfortable with the conclusions I drew , " she told Time magazine . <p> It will take years and millions of dollars to sort through her mountain of disorganized files , investigators say . <p> Underneath is a nagging question : What if innocent people were executed because of Gilchrist 's testimony ? <p> This haunts Jim Fowler . <p> Four months after his son 's 1986 conviction , Fowler 's 82-year-old mother , Anne Laura Fowler , was raped and murdered in her Oklahoma City home . Gilchrist 's testimony helped put Robert Lee Miller Jr . in prison . But 10 years after being sent to death row , Miller was released when a DNA semen analysis proved he did n't attack Mrs. Fowler . ( Another man now awaits trial in the case , and defense lawyers are questioning evidence handled by Gilchrist 's lab . ) <p> Other questions obsess Jim Fowler . <p> If Gilchrist was wrong about Miller and Pierce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others already put to death ? <p> The state says no . <p> " We have done a review of all of those cases and have preliminarily established that they 're not problematic , " said Gerald Adams , spokesman for the attorney general 's office . <p> Miller is now represented by Garvin Isaacs , a criminal defense attorney who fills a room simply by entering it . In a thick Oklahoma drawl , Isaacs does n't talk , he thunders . Arms outstretched , palms up , he frets that the scales of justice will forever be unbalanced by one of the worst scandals in Oklahoma 's legal history . <p> " We 're in deep trouble , " he says , seated at a gleaming table in his office conference room . " The saddest part to me is that all these innocent people have gone to prison . I think there 's a high degree of possibility that some of those people who were executed were innocent . " <p> Gilchrist , he contends , " was not inept . She was mean . She deliberately convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II " interview , Gilchrist said , " I 've never intentionally done anything wrong in a case . " <p> Jim Fowler thinks like Isaacs . Few things are inconceivable to him now . <p> Fowler lost his second son in 1994 , while Mark was on death row . " Jimbo " Fowler was killed in a motorcycle accident on his way to work . The way Fowler 's mother died makes the door to his mind slam shut . <p> " I do n't have the words , " he says . He weeps , then coughs , then apologizes . <p> Mark and Jimbo were adopted separately , each at 2 weeks old , from Catholic Charities . They were not blood brothers , but Fowler and his first wife , Carolyn , raised them to be . Jimbo was older and " Mark liked to do whatever big brother did , " their father said . <p> He holds up a photo of Carolyn and the boys , dated April 1968 . Mark is a little boy with jug ears and a crew cut , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he leans against his mother 's knees , his right hand in her lap . Jimbo leans in from the other side . In the middle , a pretty woman in coral pumps smiles beneath a hat band sprouting pink flowers . <p> Mark was 15 when Carolyn died of cancer . " He knew his biological mother had abandoned him . Then the only mother he knew died , " says his father . " I 've always wondered if that had anything to do with it . " <p> " It " being Mark 's downfall . <p> He was arrested a few days after the murders , after Fox went home and told his roommates , " I 've done something terrible tonight . I killed some men . " His roommates turned him in . Fox told detectives he had n't gone to the market alone . <p> He and Mark Fowler were tried together , on the same charges . <p> District Attorney Bob Macy told jurors there was no way one man could kill three people with a single-action shotgun . <p> Gilchrist testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shotgun and indicated " close violent contact . " The defense put on a forensic expert who said the strands indicated no such thing , and were just as consistent with Fox 's hair as they were to Mark Fowler 's . <p> The jury believed Gilchrist . <p> " She answers questions in a way that makes it clear she damn well knows what she 's talking about , " said Jim Fowler . " And when ( she 's ) talking to a jury , some of them were awestruck by this woman . This was gospel . " <p> After Marks conviction , Jim and his second wife , Ann , whom he married in 1980 , could not bring themselves to visit the state penitentiary . <p> " We were so angry at him , " the father said . " What the hell is my boy doing in prison ? This is not the way I raised him . " <p> But over time reality sets in , he said , " And then you get over it . " <p> During jailhouse visits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ' Pop , I did a damn stupid thing . I went down to get this easy money . " <p> In those conversations , " nothing was left unsaid . There must have 20,000 ' I love you 's , " ' the father said . Fellow Roman Catholics from bishops on down begged in vain for Gov . Frank Keating to grant clemency . <p> Early on the day of Mark 's execution , Fowler called his son . <p> " I told him that there might be as many as 200 people outside holding a candlelight vigil for him . He said , ' Dad , if that happens put your hand on your head when they pull back the curtain so I 'll know . " <p> So Ann and Jim Fowler went to the execution , accompanied by bishops , priests and their son 's appeals attorney . They sat down shaking . " And the curtain went up and there was Mark on the gurney , " said his father . <p> All of the family witnesses put a hand atop their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw that , and he settled down , " said Jim Fowler . <p> Next came the question . Did the prisoner have any last words ? <p> Mark began to recite the Hail Mary . <p> His six witnesses joined him . <p> " Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee , blessed art thou amongst women ... " <p> And then it was over . " We got up and waltzed out , " said Jim Fowler , " went back to the hotel , had a few drinks and went to bed . And that was how that went . " <p> Since then , the Fowlers spend most of their time fighting the death penalty . They are thankful Miller was not executed for the murder of Jim 's mother . <p> Sometimes , Jim Fowler wishes only that Gilchrist and prosecutor Macy , the two he holds responsible for his son 's death , be found guilty of sending innocent people to prison . In other moments , when pain and anger well up , he fantasizes punishments he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has her own brand in mind . " If she 's guilty , let her spend a few years in prison - and Macy , too . Let them serve some of the punishment they 've dealt out . " <p> End Adv for Sunday , July 22 , and thereafter <p>
