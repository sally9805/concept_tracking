Chapter One Life 's a bit of a beach these days for Ginger Walsh , who finds herself single at 41 and back home living in the family FROG ( finished room over the garage ) in the fictional town of Marshbury . She 's spent a few too many years in sales , and is hoping for a more fulfilling life as a sea glass artist , but instead is babysitting her sister 's kids and sharing overnights with Noah , her sexy glassblower boyfriend with commitment issues and a dog Ginger 's cat is n't too crazy about . You can almost smell the salt air as you take this rollicking ride with one slightly relationship-challenged single woman , one older BlackBerry obsessed married-with-children sister on the verge of turning fifty , one dump picking father , one kama sutra t-shirt wearing mother , one movie crew come to town with a very cute gaffer , plus a couple of Red Hat Realtors and a pair of evil twins . Reminiscent of her bestseller Must Love Dogs in all the right ways , yet very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with warmth , wit , and wisdom , as you 'll see in the following passages .... I was squeaky clean and my hair had been conditioned for at least two of the suggested three minutes when the water went cold . I did a quick rinse , then turned the faucet off . The plastic shower curtain moved a few inches , and a clean white towel magically appeared . Noah had already left when I woke up , but maybe he 'd only made a breakfast run . Or maybe he just could n't stay away . I smiled . " Here you go , " my mother said from the other side of the curtain . I screamed . I wrapped myself in the towel and stepped out of my tiny square shower and practically into my mother . " Jesus , Mom , I thought you were ... someone else . " " Noah ? He left at six-twenty-five this morning . And tell him to watch that pebble business or he 'll break a window . " My mother started dabbing my shoulders with another towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabbing . There were no limits in our family . I could clearly remember sitting in the bathtub with a book one night when I was ten or eleven . My sister , Geri , had already gone off to college , and my parents had company for dinner . Suddenly , the door opened and four adults looked in at me and my bubbles . " Say good night to Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien , " my mother said . Today , my mother was wearing her Girls Just Wan na Have Fun T-shirt , and a couple of tiny beaded braids in her thick grey hair made her look like she 'd just come back from the Caribbean . I was kind of wishing she were there now . " Listen , " she said , " your father and I have found the townhouse of our dreams . The Village of Silver Springs . Fitness Center with personal trainers , billiards , bingo , indoor boccie ball , salsa lessons . You know how your father loves to dance . " " It 's not just a townhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I peeked behind my mother to see two women wearing red hats . They were measuring what I liked to think of as my carriage house with a bright yellow tape measure . My cat watched silently from the rumpled sheets of my still-pulled-out sleeper sofa . On my best days , I could convince myself that , with me at the far end of my parents ' driveway , and my sister and her family about a mile away , we had our own little Kennedy compound . On my worst days , I had to admit that I lived in an apartment over my parents ' garage . The women waved . I hiked my towel up a little higher . " Mom , " I whispered , " get them out of here . Now . " My mother reached down and scratched my cat under his chin . She said , " Hi , handsome , " and he purred his acknowledgment . She nudged yesterday 's bra , which had somehow ended up in the middle of the floor , with her toe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit neater around here , honey . " One of the women , the one wearing a jeweled red visor , did n't seem to be the least bit bothered by the fact that I was dripping all over the apartment she was trying to help my mother sell right out from under me . In fact , she acted like I was n't even there . " A FROG is a nice bonus feature , " she said . " Everybody loves a FROG . " " Excuse me , " I said , not that it was any of her business . " But , actually , it 's not a Finished Room Over the Garage . It has a bath and a kitchen , which makes it technically more of a carriage house . " Everybody ignored me . " If you bury a statue of St. Joseph in the ground , " the visor woman said , " the house will get scooped up right away . Guaranteed . " " Mom , " I said with every bit of outrage I could muster without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was n't a legal rental unit would make them lose interest , or if it would only get me in trouble with my mother . " You have to be careful how you bury it , " the other woman said . Her hat had a frothy drape of red netting that covered her eyes , so maybe I really was invisible to her . " My cousin said she faced hers away from the house when she buried it , and the house across the street sold instead . " " Upside down and facing the house is the way to go , " the other woman said . " If he 's upside down , that way St. Joseph will work extra hard to get out of the ground and onto the mantel of your new townhouse . " My mother was actually nodding , as if these two trespassing red-hatted women were not completely and certifiably insane . " Well , " I said loudly , " I do n't want to keep you . Sounds like you 'd better get over to the mall fast before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nodding , so I started inching my mother toward the door , hoping the other two would follow . They did , though the first woman had unfortunately mastered the art of walking and talking at the same time . " But , " she said , " for St. Joseph to be fully effective , you also have to do all the necessary fix ups , price the house to reflect the current market , and of course , properly stage the home . Cut flowers , cookies baking in the oven , some pine scent potpourri . Then you add the statue . " We were almost there . My mother leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek , and I reached past her to open the door . " Sorry I have to run , " she said . " Not a problem , " I said as I hiked my towel up again . " We 'll catch up later , honey . " " You bet we will , " I said . When I slammed the door behind them , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really think Noah would be in there with another woman , but you did n't get to be my age without a few jolting experiences in your life , and it never hurt to be sure . Noah was alone . His glassblowing furnace was open and blazing . He must have just turned on his CD player , because a scratchy recording of Gregorian chants blasted out at full volume and made me jump . He was wearing jeans with huge , frayed white rips in them and an old T-shirt . He leaned back against the wall , and then kind of slid down until he was sitting cross-legged on the floor . I was half waiting for him to start chanting along with the Gregorians . Or even to start wrapping duct tape around PVC pipe so he could have a swordfight with some elves or something . He sat there for a little while , then stood up again and tied a washed-out red bandana around his head , tangling some of his hair in when he knotted it in the back . He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited to see something along the lines of one of his open studio demonstrations . Instead , he started to dance . It took me completely by surprise , and I stepped away from the window and pulled my cat with me . I peeked in again , from the side . It was n't quite a dance after all . More like tai chi or some kind of yoga in motion . Whatever he was doing , it was filled with long , graceful , continuous movements , and I could have sworn there was a little bit of imaginary swordplay in there , too . He picked up a long blowpipe with a big knob of sea green glass on the end and clamped it across his work bench . Then he grabbed another smaller rod and dipped it into the furnace , and when he pulled it out he rolled the button-shaped gather of hot glass around in an old tin filled with crushed cobalt glass . He kept the first pipe spinning with his knee at the same time he twirled molten glass from the second pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some metal tongs and reached into the glass and twisted and pulled at it until it froze into a series of waves . He stopped and put everything down , stepped back , and looked at the knob from all sides , gave it a spin , then he did some more almost dancing around the room . He came back and unclamped the blowpipe and plunged the knob into the furnace . He placed it back in the clamp again and kept it spinning with one hand . With the other , he reached into another tin and pulled out a handful of something that might have been pieces of gold and silver foil and sprinkled them like confetti over the knob . He put the blowpipe back into the furnace again , and sweat soaked through his T-shirt . He pulled it back out and dropped the glass end down until it almost touched the ground . The monks were still chanting , and Noah looked like he was lip-synching into the other end of the pipe . Maybe he was . Then he started to swing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were twirling a fiery baton . Finally , he lifted the pipe and placed his creation into the empty center of a sphere made from several lengths of copper tubing circled around and around and dangling from a clamp . He blew some air into the blowpipe and quickly covered the opening with his thumb . The blob of glass expanded slowly and magically until it filled up the copper orb and became some new kind of ringed planet . Watching Noah like this was somehow more intimate than having sex with him . I felt like a stalker . In fact , I probably looked like a stalker . * * * " Come on , let 's find something good to do for your birthday . " Geri leaned over the balcony so she could catch the light from the parking lot . " One of Last Call 's intoxicatingly handsome employees will deliver himself to your place of inebriation by way of motorcycle . Once there , the custom Italian cycle folds up and stows neatly in your trunk , and said handsome employee drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds so sexy . " " It sounds okay , " I said . " But we 'd have to get drunk first . And then we 'd probably puke all over the handsome employee . And , most likely , they do n't have a Last Call franchise on the Cape anyway . " " We could start one , " my sister said . " Yeah , but then we 'd have to go all the way to Italy for the motorcycles . " " And the handsome employees . " " And what would we feed them ? Where would they sleep ? " Geri sighed . " You 're right . It 's a lot of work . " " It always is . " I pushed myself out of the chair and tiptoed into the hotel room . I opened the minibar and took out two minibottles . I tiptoed back out and handed one to Geri . " Here you go . We 'll just stay right here and pretend . " " Is Baileys Irish Cream from Italy ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 's my glass ? " " Do n't you know anything ? You have to drink from the bottle or it 's not an authentic minibar experience . Plus , I do n't want to sound like Mom , but we have no idea who 's been drinking from those glasses . " (
