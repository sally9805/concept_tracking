Preface // Author 's Note // In my three decades of writing about actual crimes , only once have I been personally involved in a case before I wrote about it . That , of course , was the story of Ted Bundy , who had been my partner at Seattle 's Crisis Clinic a few years before he was exposed as a merciless serial killer . During the years I knew him , I had no more knowledge of the man behind the " mask " than anyone else who interacted with him . Indeed , I had a contract to write a book about an unknown killer  --  my first book contract  --  only to find out I would be writing about my friend . // Now , twenty years after that almost incomprehensible coincidence , another singular circumstance has touched me , making this book much more than the recounting of a tragedy that echoes and re-echoes in the lives of so many people . In a sense , I was chosen by the victim herself to tell her story , even though we never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fate , I had no reason to believe that we had any connection at all . // Her name was Sheila Bellush , and she was the age of my daughters . The premonition that haunted her for the last ten years of her life finally found her in Florida . Before that , she lived in San Antonio , Texas , and in Hawaii . I had never been to those places . My home territory has been the northwest since the mid- ' 50s  --  Oregon and then Washington . // My father 's lifelong wish was to have a homestead in Oregon , a house high on a hill that overlooked trees , fields , and rivers . He found his beloved forty acres south of Salem , Oregon . For the last thirty years of their lives , my parents lived there on a ranch where the only sounds beyond the wind in the fir trees were the cries of hawks and eagles and the occasional cougar . It was such an obscure part of Oregon that few people had ever heard of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Seattle . // Years after my parents were gone , but only two miles away from that ranch , a young couple found their perfect section of earth to build on . They were patching together their lives after three years of horror and bereavement , and a decade of dread before that . The wife had a number of missions to accomplish , and one of them was to find me. // She was Sheila Bellush 's sister . When we finally met , she told me that she had tried many avenues to locate me , unaware of how easy it really was . Had she only called information in Seattle , she could have obtained my office phone number . In January 2000 I received an e-mail signed with her name ; I learned later it was really her husband who wrote to me because his wife had grown discouraged when her efforts brought only dead ends . // Sheila 's sister told me they were determined to try one last time , and then give up because they did n't know where else to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wrote back to her immediately . // " Ten years ago , " she said , " when Sheila ended her marriage , she told me , ' If anything ever happens to me , promise me that you will see that there is an investigation . ' " // Her sister promised . // There was more : seemingly a throwaway remark said half in jest . It happened that Sheila Bellush was watching the miniseries of my book Dead by Sunset in the fall of 1995 . Recognizing something in the character of a man accused of murder , she called her sister Kerry Bladorn and asked her to turn on her television set . " Remember what I told you about what to do if anything happened to me ? " Sheila asked , and Kerry said she did . " And now promise me one more thing , " Sheila said . " That if I 'm not here , you will find Ann Rule and have her write my story . " // Again Sheila 's sister promised . I learned later that Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything happened to her . And so I face an awesome project ; I have been given a huge responsibility by a young woman who once read my books . After so many years this is the first time a victim has chosen me to tell the story of her life  --  and death  --  long before her premonition of disaster came true . I owe her the truth and the compassion of those who read this book . I owe her a voice when she no longer has one . // For a long time I have felt a kind of " presence " of the people I write about , much in the way homicide detectives come to know the murder victims they strive to avenge . But never , never have I honored a commitment urgently foisted upon me by a woman who was a complete stranger , and who has become as familiar to me as someone in my own family . // So this is for Sheila . I hope I get it right . //          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
