Pulitzer-prizewinning humorist Dave Barry , 58 , may have stopped writing his weekly column a year ago , but he managed to scrounge together some thoughts for his 27th book , out next week , Dave Barry 's Money Secrets : Like : Why Is There a Giant Eyeball on the Dollar ? He spoke with TIME 's Jeff Chu on Neil Diamond , the state of newspapers and his own endless run for the presidency . <P> WHY FOCUS ON MONEY ? There seem to be thousands of books out there about money , and I am basically trying to viciously mock them . They do n't seem to do a lot of good . Look at how many have been sold . Theoretically , every living human being should be at least a millionaire if these books were even halfway effective . <P> YOUR FANS MAY NOTE THE ABSENCE OF BOOGER , ONE OF YOUR TRADEMARK WORDS . In fact , I mainly used it to describe the kind of humor I do- " Oh , I write booger jokes . " If you actually were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ... a day that I used it . Only a few thousand times did I go to that well . <P> YOU PICK ON FAMOUS PEOPLE-ALAN GREENSPAN IN THIS BOOK , NEIL DIAMOND IN THE PAST . I 've had surprisingly nice reactions . I wrote a column making fun of Neil Diamond 's lyrics " ' I am , ' I said/To no one there/ And no one heard at all/Not even the chair . " I said it was one of the worst lyrics ever written . The column became The Book of Bad Songs , which I dedicated to him . A few years ago , he was playing South Florida and invited me to his concert . Which I did n't go to because a ) I could n't , and b ) he might have had people kill me . <P> LAST JANUARY YOU SAID YOU WERE TAKING A BREAK FROM YOUR WEEKLY COLUMN . LAST MONTH YOU MADE THE HIATUS PERMANENT . I do n't think I 'm ever going back to writing weekly columns . It was clear early on-like , with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long time to write with nothing to say . <P> YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO SAY TO BLOG ( WWW.DAVEBARRY.COM ) . I like blogging because it 's flexible . Some days you do a lot . Some days you do n't do any . I also like the interaction . If you write an entry and let people comment on it , it 's amazing how funny it can get . The Internet is a good thing for people who write . <P> NEWSPAPERS HAVE CHANGED SINCE YOU STARTED . They 're less edgy . I got my start in the late ' 70s , sending clips to editors and saying , " You should publish this . " A surprising number did . I do n't know that that would work now . When we had more space , more money and less obsession with losing readers , editors were quicker to print what they thought was funny just because they thought it was funny . Now they 're more likely to wonder , Is it really funny ? Will it annoy people ? Maybe we should show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INFLUENCES ? My biggest by far-besides my mother , who had an incredibly dark sense of humor-was Robert Benchley , a humor essayist . I always wanted to write like him . He was silly , and that appealed to me , that a grownup could be that silly and get away with it .
