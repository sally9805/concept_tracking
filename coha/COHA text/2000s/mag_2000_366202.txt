What 's the best way to deliver an unpleasant message to George W. Bush ? You say little , and let the evidence speak for itself . So , just after Christmas , when the Republican front runner returned to Texas after shaky moments in three debates , he was handed a tape . It had to be to the point because , as Bush told TIME last week aboard his campaign bus , " I 'm not gon na watch hours of tapes of myself , and I do n't want to rehash all those debates . " But this tape was crystalline in its message : it had been carefully edited to exclude all the other candidates , leaving only Bush onscreen with his scripted , repetitive answers and awkward impromptus . The Texas Governor plopped the tape into a VCR , watched it alone at the mansion and got the picture . " I 'm a competitor , " he told TIME last week . " I want to win . And I 'm wise enough to understand that all of us need to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two about self-improvement . He did it in business , by turning a mediocre career in oil and gas into a success story in baseball . And he did it again in politics . Having run just once , and lost , in a 1978 House race , he ousted a favored incumbent Governor and then won a thumping re-election four years later . Now he is trying to do it again . After flubbing a reporter 's foreign-policy pop quiz in the fall and seeming to be in over his head at those early debates in December , Bush has begun to erase some of the doubts about whether he has the sure-footedness to be a winning presidential candidate . <P> For one thing , he no longer looks like a sure loser in New Hampshire . Some polls last week even showed him with a narrow lead over his rival , Senator John McCain . " Before Christmas , the Bush campaign was in a lot of trouble , " says New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett . " But they made some changes . The slide has stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has campaigned almost nonstop for months . ( To lower expectations , Bush aides are predicting that they might lose New Hampshire , even as they work flat out to win it . ) In Iowa , where McCain is not participating , Bush has maintained a solid margin over publishing tycoon Steve Forbes in the final week before the Jan. 24 caucuses . And the outlook is even rosier nationally , where a new TIME/CNN poll shows Bush trouncing McCain among Republicans by 45 points . <P> On the campaign trail and in a series of recent debates , Bush has begun , slowly , to find his voice . He does n't wait patiently for his turn to answer questions but jumps in to defend himself when one of his opponents attacks . And he is no longer too cautious to take a verbal swing at a rival , as he has proved of late by gleefully maligning McCain 's economic plan of modest tax cuts and debt reduction as something only a liberal like Al Gore could love . Aides have also backed off . Rather than grilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out on stage rattled , handlers have allowed the Governor plenty of time to rest beforehand . All in all , the result has been a more confident , relaxed candidate . " A lot of politics , and of running for President , is getting used to the process , " Bush said in explaining his change in style . " Man , it 's new to me . And I 'm getting used to it . "
