YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH HIS STANCE . His stroke . The way he stepped out of the batter 's box when his team ailed for runs , stepped out and just stood still , arms crossed , until the ump urged him back . He 'd return to home plate , all right , but only after ignoring repeated warnings . He took no practice cuts and made no adjustments , unless you count that hard glare he 'd direct toward the stands . Like he expected the scoreboard to apologize . More than once you probably brought your mitt along to the game , dreaming of catching one of his screaming line drives . God knows he tried to make your dream come true . The guy was a baseball repellant . For so many hard-throwing pitchers it was a familiar failure : Throw Mr. Spalding into his wheelhouse , then say farewell-108 red stitches instantly soaring . The staggering career numbers of Steve Sprissel are done up in a bow for the Cooperstown Hall of Fame : .308 , 485 , 1,441 . These are statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshly cut backyard lawns . Not one of those 485 homeruns came cheap , either . Sprissel did n't get cheated on a single swing . Thanks to that approach , some sportswriters believe he did get cheated out of some of his career . If Sprissel had ever learned to choke up , he might 've not torn that tendon during his sixth season or wrenched that bum shoulder the year he turned thirty-nine , the last year he could see his way clear to play . <p> By the end of his last season-which he mostly spent in Triple-A and which I was there to chronicle-Sprissel was so gimpy , our organist had time to play the entire opening theme from M.A.S.H . during his labored shuffle from on-deck circle to batter 's box . That 's when I realized the inevitable was closing in . Sprissel must 've known , too , only he was n't about to let his dignity get leeched by some stilted farewell tour , receiving rocking chairs in Gulfport or bronzed cowboy boots in Tupelo . But Sprissel deserved to be heralded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spartanburg Stags , I was the one with the means . The one with the loudspeaker . But management had warned me not to tout Sprissel 's major league feats during his at bats . And they nixed the video crew 's plan of showing highlight reels of his best hits in between innings . <p> None of us in the publicity department could fathom why Sprissel 's tour with the Stags was being played down . Not that we knew what Sprissel was doing in the minors in the first place , taking hacks with hacks . We 'd heard that some of Steve 's family-his mamma , and a sibling maybe-lived just a few towns over from Spartanburg . But being closer to kin hardly seemed to me like grounds for giving up the major leagues . <p> Sprissel 's official story for knocking around Triple-A was rehab for that bum shoulder , his latest spring sprung loose . He was only getting his timing back while he healed . But it was late June in the Deep South-the heat and humidity cranking so hard it smashed mirages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Sprissel listened to bats crack in the cage . The way he watched dusk approach during night games . When I saw him limp down the first base line like he was running in a sack race , I knew : Tendinitis had sunk its career-ending claws into his ankle . <p> Here I should make a brief comment about me : My life had gone well . Better than my friends had predicted . They judged me like you do an abandoned mutt left tied to a tree : Anything I did beyond surviving and finding a warm bed offered out of pity would be gravy . But I had this habit of heisting my own good luck , so I 'd grown warily protective of my job . It was the only glorious thing in my life left to piss away . <p> And it was a glory gig . A job so simple I could do it drunk-and often did , guzzling Pisco sours between pitching changes . I hid the hooch in a cabinet and held my bladder until our latest loss was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-minute hike ) . However-and what story 's worth telling without a however ? - my glory gig was almost over . I could see the scrawl on the wall . The big-league club we 're affiliated with was in the throes of a massive fire sale , dumping their big salaries and hot prospects , reloading for a team five years down the line to coincide with the opening of a brand new ballpark . That meant Sprissel was gone . <p> And so was I. Just before our July 4th game , a pal in human resources tipped me off . My contract , he said , would be terminated early , by the turn of August . Management had a damage-control plan in place : utter anonymity . They 'd decided not to distribute lineup cards to fans for the rest of the season ; the equipment manager had been ordered to strip the names off the backs of players ' uniforms . Canning me would leave the fans with no guide , no one to identify which castoff players they should be booing , making their miscues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . Sure , my mole replied , but it would be a wasted gesture : Material witnesses had seen me drunk on the job . Perhaps even photographed it . <p> Now , was it my fault the sport moved at such a goddamn glacial pace ? <p> Besides announcing names , my main duty was to inform our drowsy crowds what each player had done ( or more likely , had n't done ) in his previous plate appearances . On that July 4th game , two drinks already in my belly , I figured if I was going down , I might as well speed the rate of descent . Sprissel 's last at bat had been awful . He 'd struck out on a fifty-five-foot curve with the bases jammed . But I did n't want to dwell on that . So when he led off the seventh , I failed to mention his failure from the fifth . Instead I announced : " Your attention , please . Now batting for the Stags , hitting and playing third , number forty-one , Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority that , during last weeks three-game set with the Shreveport Captains , Steve ate every meal at the Jumpin " Jambalaya Diner . He always ordered the special , with extra cayenne , and sides of corn bread and collards . " <p> For some reason , the few fans left in the stands hollered over my little factoid . Maybe thrilled to hear that a future Hall-of-Famer went to the same greasy spoon they did . Upon hearing my comment , Sprissel glared in the direction of the main loudspeaker . Shook his head , beat mud crumbs off his cleats , stepped back into the box , then turned on a first pitch change-up , handcuffing the right fielder on one hop . Single and an error , runner on second , nobody out . A rally was on . The Stags actually forced our scorekeeper to work that half inning , plating five runs . <p> We still lost , of course : 7 to 6 in 12 . But what a game ! It would 've been over in 9 innings , or 10 or 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabs in each of those frames . <p> Moments after the final out , as I was scurrying to the urinal , the team 's scrawny , adolescent bat boy flagged me down , still wearing his batting helmet and uniform , its belt hitched way too high above his belly button . " You the guy who talks to the crowd ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Mister Sprissel wants to see you . " <p> " Yeah ? Where ? " <p> " Down in the clubhouse . Over at his locker . " <p> " Mind if I piss first ? " <p> For someone I figured for fourteen , the bat boy 's grip on my wrist was shockingly strong . " Man , " he croaked , " I do n't give a shit what you do or when . But Mr. Sprissel told me to get you to that clubhouse in five minutes , no excuses . So you 'll just have to hold it . " <p> The clubhouse was still abuzz with the foreign thrill of almost winning . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they turned off their hip-hop CDs , tossed armfuls of socks and balls into their duffels , and evacuated what was surely about to become a crime scene . <p> Sprissel stood in a corner , holding as many bats at one time as he could without his wrists bending from the weight . " You the announcer ? " he asked . I nodded . " Heard what you said in the seventh . I do n't like stunts . " <p> He let go of his bat handles and a whimpering grunt , all at once . Pine and ash clopped against the gray concrete . Ferocious echoes splattered off of every wall . <p> " I do like good luck charms , though , " he went on , kneading the muscles in his forearms . " And I had two straight hits after your little crack . " <p> " Three circus catches , too , " I reminded him . <p> " Bullshit . " He spat a slug of chaw into the shower drain . " You do n't get credit for those . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an oval mirror that hung above the showerhead . His reflection , blurred by steam , seemed sympathetic . After a moment he turned away from it . His reflection had answered a question ; he had n't wiped off all his eye black yet . Scratching at it with a thumbnail , he kept talking . " Plan on keeping this up ? Your running commentary ? Tailing me into diners and liquor stores ? You got nothing better to do with your summer ? " <p> " I could ask the same question , " I said , careful to put away Steve 's equipment while I spoke . My dad used to tell me that well-timed charity always takes the edge off of tart remarks . I wonder sometimes what TV show he cribbed that line from . Does anyone know ? <p> " I mean , " I went on , neatly creasing pairs of Steve 's batting gloves , " you and me do n't have much in common . But one thing we do share right now is near-unemployment . My days in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you on the field . It 's in the papers . Big club 's salary dumping like crazy . " <p> " Maybe they are . So ? " <p> " So what I 'm guessing is , they 've already tried to dump you , but no other team 's willing to take a flyer on your health . " <p> " I 'll play until the color 's gone out of my eyes , I guess . " <p> " Stags are twenty-two games under .500 , Steve ; those eyes ought a be black-and-white by now . " <p> He shot me the tucked smile of someone who 'd nearly given up on striving for discretion . " Buddy , you a student of the game ? Then you ought a know I spent five long years in the minors before I got the call . Every one of my coaches put in a lot of effort to nurse out my bad habits . And I was in no way a ' can't-miss ' prospect . So who 's to say I 'm not here to mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's heroes ? " <p> There was one sentence more about to slip past his teeth , lingering , but he held it back . Instead he asked me what I was doing later that night . <p> " Why , " I asked , " you want to wine and dine me ? " <p> Sprissel chortled . " I host a Texas hold em affair over at my rental house every week , me and the rest of the infield . But we need a fifth . You any good ? " <p> " Awful . " <p> " Perfect . You 'll come tonight , then . Bring beer . Poison Dart Pilsner , longnecks , not the cans . They 're my favorite . Feel free to tell the crowd that tomorrow . You can also tell them how I vacuumed up your wallet . " <p> That is exactly what he did . I folded early and often that night . It was like the other gamblers held marked hands and I had transparencies . When Steve 's phone rang around 1:30,1 was sloshed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table to get it . Sprissel , who was calling on a hundred-dollar bet , grunted approval . Took me a while to stagger to the phone-I nearly ran into a jib door on my way over-finally picking up on the eighth ring , half expecting it to be my loan officer . " Sprissel 's residence . " <p> " Well you 're new to his game , " a voice said , followed by a string of silence , and then : " Do n't you know who I am ? " Instantly I got conscious of the crackling mosquito zapper outside . Apprehension does n't figure into my drunkenness often , but this woman 's voice , as light and piercing as a needle , had done the trick . " I 'm Steven 's mother . " <p> " Oh , OK . Steven 's here , I guess . " I looked down the hall . " Though kind of busy . " Sprissel was talking trash about someone 's hand . Not knowing if this woman would want to hear Steve bragging and loaded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if he could sober up while his morn and a total stranger made small talk . " You want me to bring your son over to the phone ? " <p> " What I want , " she said , " is for you to send my son back home . " <p> " I do n't follow , " I confessed . <p> " Course you do n't , Mr. Voice of the Stags . Listen , just announce this . Tell him I 'm off the clock . And tell him I already inherited enough trouble with the child I got ; I wo n't baby-sit his trouble , too . Either he picks his kids up from my house or the state does . " <p> The next day at the ballpark , a memo from the front office awaited me . Stag management had approved , vigorously , of my unique approach for plugging products before player at bats . In fact , they 'd left me lists of brand names and local businesses I should feel free to " work in " during this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Biting the ends of my sunglasses , I savored that ellipsis , its flirting suggestion that the demise of my job just might be negotiable if I was willing to do the sponsor song-and-dance . <p> The Stags took the field that day looking as solid as toast in water . Each player seemed both thirsty and bloated . Apparently Sprissel 's poker game was n't last night 's only source of entertainment . I knew I 'd need great material to keep the fans from fleeing the stadium early : This game was going to sting . Our foe was the Royals ' top farm team , and they were headed to the playoffs . Their catcher ran faster than our shortstop when he was n't hungover . Our outfielders were fumbling fungoes and popping antacids ; our first baseman was kneeling on the bag , blinking his bloodshot eyes and trying not to get sick all over his mitt . Only the most catatonic of ground balls would n't pierce our infield today . <p> In the first inning Sprissel came to the plate with one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your attention , please . Now batting , number forty-one , Steve Sprissel ... Hey Steve , after the pitcher intentionally walks you to first base here , your mom would like you to take another stroll . Seems you have a couple of small packages at her house you need to pick up . " <p> Both pitcher and batter took umbrage at my poke . The pitcher disobeyed his manager 's order to intentionally walk Sprissel , throwing one right down the heart of the plate instead , heavy on pride and light on gas . Sixty feet six inches later , Sprissel , whose bat had been sloped over his shoulders , crushed that ball into dead centerfield . A crater of hot , empty bleacher seats filled up suddenly with happy , boozy fans bolting for the souvenir ball . <p> I went easy on Steve the rest of the game , and even managed to start shilling from management 's list . " After each and every home game , folks , Steve Sprissel reaches for the penetrating relief of BENGAY . Got big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ninth , Sprissel 's second homer broke a four-all tie and the Stags ' long losing streak . Still , with baseball , one streak snaps and another flies on : The clubhouse bat boy again was sent to fetch me to the locker room . This time I followed without resistance . <p> " The team 's gon na start getting the wrong idea about us , " I told Steve , watching a few of the players bolt . " Think I 'm coming down here for conjugal visits or something . " <p> " Dammit , " Sprissel said , shaping his hair with a wet comb . " Do n't touch my life . Do n't bring up personal shit in front of twenty-five thousand fans . " <p> " You get a look at that crowd ? " I asked , glancing at a photo taped in his locker . " We probably drew less than twenty-five hundred . Besides , I did n't say that the packages were your two children . All I said was your mom wants to see you ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm talking about the one from the fifth . " <p> " The BENGAY remark ? " I was incredulous . " But it 's true . The trainers practically cure you in that stuff . " <p> " No one needs to know how broke down I am . " <p> " Steve , what difference does it make , if you 're calling it quits after the season ? " <p> He slapped his chest . " I decide when I call it quits ! " <p> " Got your per diems , folks . Per diems . " It was the clubhouse attendant , an old black man with spindly forearms , a faded tattoo of either a trident or a rake on one of them . He was handing out hotel and meal money for the players ' upcoming series in Tupelo . Sprissel took his pay stub from the attendant and pierced it through one of his cleat spikes , which hung from a hook in his locker . It reminded me of shrikes , those birds that prepare for winter by hunting down bugs every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving those bugs behind until they are truly hungry . <p> Steve had laid down the gauntlet : Any mention of his decreasing skills would land me in his doghouse . Everything else , though ? Fair game . Each time that I mocked him , I thought Sprissel would erupt , or at least shoot me that disgruntled frown of outfielders who run out of room chasing what they 'd thought was a harmless fly . But in fact , the harder I hit Steve over the PA system , the harder he hit back at the plate . His average soared , courting .300 . Fastballs he had been late on were now finding their way into the parking lot . He still trotted like a three-legged dog , but he was grinning while he did it . <p> It stayed that simple for a few weeks-that is simple 's shelf life-where I kept going to poker nights , losing hands , and stocking up on fresh piles of Sprissel 's dirty laundry . Because we were gambling and because we were drunk , most of the material I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all anyway . " Your attention , please . Now batting third and playing third , number forty-one , Steve Sprissel . Steve Sprissel , folks : One satisfied girlfriend called his tongue a ' tool of the devil . ' " <p> Then I started laying into other players . " Now batting , first baseman Edgardo Rios . Heads up , ladies . You 'll know Rios is in the room when you hear his lone come-on line : " Think it 's too late for me to become an artist ? ' Cause I just found my inspiration . ' " <p> " Attention , please . Now warming up for your Spartanburg Stags , pitcher Dan Boyd , subject of tonight 's trivia question . What do emery boards , nail files , and steel wool have in common ? All three items can be found at your local Tall Order hardware store , or beneath the bill of Boyd s ball cap . " Then our organist would rip out a verse of " Your Cheating Heart . " <p> I always worried I 'd crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only complaints came from guys who had yet to receive my signature intros . They 'd buy me beers after games , plying me with their skeletons and personal vendettas , some written on old scorecards and Gatorade cups . These were men , for the most part , with no vertical movement left . Some had already been to the bigs and had n't blossomed . Some had hit the wall of their talents too early . Triple-A was their last stand . What I offered them was a beam of recognition , and they soaked in the rays . When I revealed that one of our starting pitchers ( a lefty ) kept count of the road kill he ran over in his pickup truck , our audience burned him with boos . He only waved his hands toward his face , as if to summon the flames closer . <p> For fans of a team low on talent , gossip was as welcome as a game-winning hit . Attendance rose ; turnstiles clicked ; our house of worship was once again alive . My job security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Orioles invited me to audition for the big-league club , come spring . This Week in Baseball wanted to run a segment of my best clips . How ' bout that ? <p> While airing out players ' charms and vices , I would sometimes wear earplugs to drown out the crowds ' fugue of cheers and catcalls , and just gaze at the shapes their mouths made . When they booed at my intros , they looked like they were about to apply lipstick ; when they cheered , it looked like they were flossing out food lodged in the crags of their teeth . <p> And our Stags ? They were playing more like a team . Long tossing before games . Extra batting practice . One outfielder tutored another for hours on how to shift weight with two strikes in order to protect the plate . <p> Our poker games grew more frequent , and each night we played , Steve 's mom would call sometime after putting the girls to bed . I imagined her stretching the elastic corkscrew of the phone cord as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids would n't hear . Probably the bathroom . Our talks would last anywhere up to an hour . By August I was spending more time on Steve 's phone than at his table . <p> " I 'll get it , " I said one scorching night , after the phone 's first ring . <p> " Get a number and a reason , " Sprissel barked . " ' Cause I am not on the premises . " <p> " I know the drill , Steve , " I sighed . " I 'll take your message . " <p> " Our little houseboy , " Rios remarked . Laughter trailed me down the hallway . I wondered which of them had played the role of mother-interceptor before I came along . Phone in hand , I strolled to the porch and climbed into Steve 's hammock . <p> " Evening , Mr. Voice , " she began , using the name she always called me by . <p> " We 're speaking early tonight , ma'am , " I replied , riding the hammock 's waves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep sooner ? " <p> Instead of answering , she asked , " Steve winning the pot tonight ? " <p> " Not so much . He may pull even before the night 's through . " <p> " Then he 's still got me beat . " I heard tinging ; she was arranging dishes or glasses . " I got his goddamn check in today 's mail . Tell him that , could you ? Tell him his sister wheeled on over to the mailbox and got it herself <p> " Did she use the new ramp Steve had installed ? " To my dismay , I was getting good at neutralizing Mrs. Sprissel 's anger . All I had to do was pretend to stick up for Steve , and she 'd get lost again in her own brown study . I 'd still never met her , but had seen her in a photo taped inside Steve 's locker door , a shot of her slouched on her couch between her granddaughters . She was wearing a shift , blue snaps down the front of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taking them out somewhere . During our phone chats I 'd learned a lot about Steve 's life , and her lack of one . I knew , for instance , about the accident Steve 's kid sister Laurie had been in two summers ago . One weekend , drunk and hungry for privacy , Laurie and her boyfriend had skinny-dipped past lake buoys . She 'd popped back up from a deep dive directly into an outboard motor . Left her with a severed spine . <p> The year before that accident , Sprissel had become a father . " I asked Steven , had he used birth control with the woman , " Mrs. Sprissel was saying to me now . " And you know what he answered ? ' Guess I just had faith that God would n't give me a baby . ' And he was right . God did n't give him a baby . He gave him two . Then Steve handed them right over to me . " <p> Not quite true . Steve had given it a go with the twins ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple together some nights confronting each other under the concrete tunnel connecting the dugout to the clubhouse . The pipes above them were sibilant with pressure from the hot shower water . The echoes sounded like joints cracking . Sprissel and the girl would get tangled up in a way that suggested half Nelson as much as lovers embrace . " Steve just wants you all to be provided for . That 's why he still plays . " <p> " He told you that , huh ? " Mrs. Sprissel asked , pouring herself water . " At first we had no idea . How much cash we 'd need for his sister 's hospital bills . The physical therapy . But now we know we got enough . He knows . " I heard the sound of a tissue being yanked through a plastic slit . <p> " When the girls ' mother skipped out , Steve asked me if he should quit . Point blank . ShouldVe snatched his bait . But I did n't . Now he 's had time to see how it is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think he likes what he sees ? He wants to pretend he does this for nobility , fine . But he just do n't want to leave the diamond . Once he does , he 's stuck here with me . " <p> " Season 's almost over . When it is , maybe he 'll be ready to retire , " I suggested , the shrug obvious in my tone . Steve , more and more , was talking about rehab , advances in medicine , the prospects of latching onto an American League club . <p> " Retire ? Mr. Voice , if you 're scared of the cold and dark , do you leave the campfire ? Remember that game last week in Georgia ? I watched every out on the closed-circuit TV . Steve got a full-count curve ball . Pitch buckled his knees . It was sneaky and perfect , and the umpire was ready to punch him out . But then Steve spun around , glared at the ump , and that was that . Strike three became ball four , and Steve was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't give up . Those free bases . That royal treatment . People waiting in line to tell him his feet float six inches above the turf . <p> " Everyone 's always talking about Steve 's patience at the plate , " she continued . " Know the difference between a single to center and striking out to end the inning ? Point-oh-oh-three . Three one-thousandths of a second . That 's not patience . It 's reflex . " Mrs. Sprissel exhaled heavily . " Painful physical therapy , two hours daily . Dressing and feeding three girls in the morning and barely finishing the job before lunchtime . That is fucking patience . " <p> After dashing off Mrs. Sprissel 's latest message on Steve 's dry erase board , I checked my watch . We 'd play maybe six more hands of poker . Then drive home drunk from local bars or Steve 's house , justifying our decisions not to spring for taxis because downtown was so deserted . The town lights would smear like drizzle as we drove by them . All four wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cars . How bad a shape would we have to be in to crash with all the lanes to ourselves ? <p> When I returned to the poker table , it was gamy with dried beer and everyone was relaying their off-season plans . Greg Langford , our shortstop , was going to take up golf . All the players in the show golf , he reasoned bitterly . He wanted to find out which courses . Which clubs to buy . What to wear . He was going to start acting more like a pro when he stepped off the diamond . " How ' bout you , Sprissel ? " he asked . " You about to start the longest off-season of all . What 's the first thing up your sleeve once you retire ? " <p> " Shit . Do some autograph shows , I guess . Just kill time in New York or Florida or Vegas until deer season . I want to bag a ten pointer this year . " <p> " Heard you was pulling offers to join broadcast booths . Even maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned , " it 'd need to be a good goddamn offer . To take me away from cleaning out all your guys ' pockets week after week . " Steve picked up an empty Pilsner bottle , turned it upside down , and began to swing it like a miniature bat . " Tell you what , though . And this is no joke . Seattle 's ball club is gon na be hunting for a new DH this winter . Been thinking I might do a couple years there . I could get used to all that smoked salmon . " <p> " What about your family , Steve ? " <p> Sprissel checked his swing , staring at me over the green bottle . " What do you mean ? " <p> It was like he and I were suddenly looking at the same thing , a bomb strapped to the top of a drifting ferry , and as slow as it was going , there was nothing we could do to stop it from docking and detonating . " I mean your daughters . I mean Lynne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Steve , for God 's sake . " <p> Rios pointed at me from behind his fanned-out straight . " Cool it . We all got a right to get temporary amnesia from our problems . " <p> " No , " said Sprissel , puckering on a lit cigar . " Keep at me , kid . Pot 's getting bigger , and my fortunes always seem to lift off once you start dissing me . " <p> " All these women , " I began , only to stutter , " who 've been w-w-waiting out the year for you . " I had him frozen at the plate . Only I was like the ump in that game in Georgia-had my hand up but could n't bring myself to punch him out . Sonofabitch , it 'd been great , those few weeks , hanging with this almost-Hall-of-Famer , sleeping untroubled sleep , with no anguish about where the money for my next light bill would come from . And I just could n't do it , shoot my good luck in the foot again , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shut my mouth . <p> Or rather , kept it occupied with Pilsner , so it did n't have a chance to sabotage me . I folded for the night , drank myself onto Steve 's couch , becoming so much dead weight Steve did n't even bother trying to move me until morning . <p> By noontime , when Steve drove me to the ball park , it 'd already climbed to ninety degrees . I started on my workday Pisco sours far too early , before the first inning was even in the books . They rolled down my throat readily as raindrops , cooling me in a way air conditioning just could n't . During the game I ably hawked our town 's pharmacy and bowling alley as well as two antiperspirants . Then it was time to do my eighth-inning guest interview : Louie , head mechanic at Loyal 's Auto Body . The back fender of my Bonneville was crumpled , and the idea of getting a discount fix from a mechanic lifted my spirits . 1 darted to the toilet before the interview , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players himself , something I 'd been letting the guests do on their own lately . Made them feel important , and maybe gave them incentive to up my local business discounts . As I walked out , our cleaning lady slipped in , her two young kids following close behind , little helpers holding trash bags and that dustpan that 's got a kind of metal jaw . It surprised me , seeing her in the eighth-usually she waited until the game was over to pick up and dust-but what the hell , I figured , this way I 'd come back from the John to a clean workplace . <p> After doing my business in record time I raced right back to the booth , but apparently not fast enough . The mechanic stood outside the door , his face perplexed . " You are n't announcing the players , Louie , " I observed , grinning . " You are n't doing your duty . Catch a case of stage fright ? " <p> " Holy goddamn , " Louie at Loyal 's said , breathing frantic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dude , tell me you got a fucking key to that office . " <p> " Sure I do , Louie , sure I do , " I said , though I 'd lost it months earlier . " But we do n't need it . Cleaning lady 's in there . She 'll let us back in . " <p> " Buddy , she 's the one what locked us out . " I stared back , not comprehending . Louie pointed inside the booth , and I saw that it was n't the cleaning lady at all-it was Steve Sprissel 's mother . And she was passing my live microphone back and forth between her two grandkids . " Have n't you been listening out there ? " Louie demanded . <p> " To what ? " I asked reluctantly , like I was about to tip the first domino in some amazing labyrinth . Louie at Loyal 's grabbed my wrist , the way that bat boy had done , and dragged me down a tunnel . When we reached the end , I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve 's two kids , alternating and amplified , shrieking out to their daddy to take us back , please , take us back over the loudspeaker . The players , umpires , fans , and coaches were all frozen . Our entire stadium was silent . <p> " We got ta do something man , " Louie yelled . " Got ta break that door down . " <p> Before we could , though , Sprissel had emerged from the dugout . He climbed slowly up the cement stairs , and hobbled right out onto the field , not stopping until he reached the middle of the diamond . Red-faced , he put a hand over his heart , tipped his cap toward the booth , and , after a few moments , gave his mom the OK sign . <p> " It 's over , " I said , realizing with a chuckle my pants were still unzipped . " Steve 's just come through . The lady 's gon na let us in now . " <p> Louie leaned in . " I do n't really pay attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf man . But that 's not typical baseball , right ? I mean , what the hell was that ? " <p> " Patience , " I said , " paving off " <p> The next inning was the ninth . With the game tied , Steve was due up second . During what would turn out to be Sprissel 's final professional at bat , he was plunked by a tight fastball . Dinged right off his funny bone , and it had to hurt bad-this was his only plate appearance , as long as I 'd seen him play , without elbow pads and body armor . But he did n't call for time . He winced , laid his bat down , and took his base . Then took a healthy lead off of first , which the pitcher allowed : Steve was no threat to steal . On the very next pitch , though , I swear , Sprissel scored all the way from first base on a long single that caromed wildly off the right field wall . Not one person partial to America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of those legs , and that 's just why Steve 's wager worked . The right fielder got flustered and missed his cutoff man by thirty feet . Two infielders swiveled away from the oncoming throw , like they were the finish line tape breaking in some race the baseball had just won . It may have been the most mad twenty seconds of our entire season . Caught up in the play , I clean forgot to check for the third base coach 's signal as Steve ripped around the base paths , but I do like to think the green light to head home was not an order , but an instinct . <p> Author Affiliation
