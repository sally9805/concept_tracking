More than any other modern movie mogul , Miramax 's Harvey Weinstein has changed the film industry , taking small , independent films out of the art-house ghetto and into the mainstream . He has also been skewered in a new book for his fearsome temper and ego . He talked with Time 's Jeffrey Ressner about that reputation , and a Miramax film that suffered an unexpected snub . <P> MIRAMAX GOT 15 OSCAR NOMINATIONS , BUT COLD MOUNTAIN WAS IGNORED FOR BEST PICTURE . WHAT HAPPENED ? I opened the movie at Christmastime so I could hopefully get Oscar nominations to fuel the box office . With the early Oscar voting this year , we fell short . There 's a lot to do for Academy members , and I do n't know how many members we got to . We just plain ran out of people who had seen this movie . <P> ARE YOU GOING TO REJIGGER RELEASE DATES FOR OSCAR-WORTHY MOVIES THIS YEAR AS A RESULT ? I just moved J.M. Barrie 's Neverland with Johnny Depp to October . With Martin Scorsese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas release , we 're going to have to see if we can push that to November . <P> THE BOOK DOWN AND DIRTY PICTURES ALLEGES THE INDEPENDENT-FILM MOVEMENT HAS BEEN CO-OPTED BY BIG CORPORATIONS , STARTING WITH DISNEY 'S PURCHASE OF MIRAMAX . DO YOU AGREE ? Yeah , my brother Bob and I sit in a little room with chemicals bubbling in test tubes figuring out how to hurt something we once loved . But seriously , the Academy Award nominations are almost an affirmation . I spent 54 weeks keeping City of God in movie theaters , and it got four nominations . How in God 's name does anybody think we 're not devoted to independent films ? <P> YOU 'VE OFTEN TAKEN A STRONG HAND IN THE EDITING OF FILMS YOU 'VE RELEASED . DO YOU INTERFERE FOR GOOD REASON ? It 's not that I ever want to take the integrity out of movies ; it 's that I want to put the integrity into them . I 've seen directors and producers want to keep stuff in that 's dull and boring and pretentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five-hour cut must be incredible ! " But the five-hour cut is usually like The Picture of Dorian Gray : it should be sitting in someone 's attic and never seen . <P> YOU 'VE BEEN PORTRAYED AS A RAMPAGING BULLY . HAVE YOU TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF ? Some things about me that make for great press have been exaggerated . The stuff I did do I take full responsibility for , and it 's usually been on behalf of a movie . I 'm passionate in that area . What 's happened to me and my pals Sean Penn and Russell Crowe and Johnny Depp is that we all have children , and fatherhood has softened our approach . It 's time for us to mellow out . <P> YOU 'VE ALSO BLAMED YOUR DIET AS A FACTOR IN INCITING YOUR TEMPER . HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR EATING HABITS ? I was never a big eater of meals , but I was an expert M &M; hider . I took M &M's,; opened the bag , put them in my jacket pockets and sneaked them at meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulin levels , which shifts the adrenal gland and triggers the temper . If somebody pulls out chocolate chip cookies now at a marketing meeting , my staff will take them right off the table for safety reasons . <P> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT DISNEY CHAIRMAN MICHAEL EISNER 'S RECENT $6.25 MILLION BONUS ? We 've just had our biggest year in the history of the company , and nobody gave me a bonus .
