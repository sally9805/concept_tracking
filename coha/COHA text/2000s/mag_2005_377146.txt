In the summer of 1847 , a panicked mother in a small village in Barnstable , Mass. , on Cape Cod , reported her 10-week-old son missing . The townsfolk fanned out to search for him . Within hours , his body was found floating in the harbor . Because no strangers were visiting that day , the villagers knew the killer was one of them . At the funeral the next day , each resident was asked to approach the tiny open coffin , lay hands on the body and declare his or her innocence , a scene described by Evan J. Albright in his book Cape Cod Confidential . The villagers were looking for signs of guilt . They had found none , and only the boy 's family remained . His mother at first recoiled at the idea of touching her dead son . Then , as she did so , she yanked her hands away from the corpse as if they had been scalded . " I did n't do it ! I did n't do it ! " she blurted out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town about an hour north of Barnstable began another unsparing manhunt this month in hopes of solving a three-year-old murder . Police in Truro , Mass. , intend to collect the DNA of every one of the town 's 790 males . After that , the cops may cast a wider net , reaching neighboring towns . They started by approaching men at Truro 's few outposts  --  the post office , the pizza place , the grocery store  --  and politely asking each if they could swipe a lollipop-size swab inside his cheek . It 's strictly voluntary , and the Truro men can say no . Then again , the police are taking the license-plate numbers of all the men they approach , and will be noting those who refuse the test . <P> Fifteen years ago , it was believed that such mass DNA collections  --  which began in Europe  --  would never catch on in the U.S. , with its stalwart protections against invasive search and seizure . But the temptation to solve unspeakable crimes , particularly ones involving children , has proved powerful . Truro 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As testing becomes faster and cheaper , such collections are becoming more frequent . And the debate about whether they are right sliced this seaside town in two last week , just it has Baton Rouge , La. ; Charlottesville , Va. ; and Miami . <P> On Jan. 6 , 2002 , Christa Worthington , 46 , a former fashion writer , was found dead , stabbed through the heart in a doorway of her bungalow . Alive and clinging to her was Ava , 21/2 , her daughter , who had spent 36 hours alone with the body . The killer had stabbed Worthington so powerfully that the blade had left a mark in the floorboards beneath her . It appeared that Ava had tried to tend to her mother , dabbing her face with a washcloth . " Mommy fell down , " she sobbingly told the person who found her . <P> Worthingtons had lived in Truro for generations . In fact , one of the first rescue workers at the scene was Christa 's cousin . Christa had moved there from New York City to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a local fisherman , which produced Ava . After her mother died , Christa decided to stay . In her shingled house on a hill , surrounded by a tangle of spindly trees , she had started a new life , although not necessarily a frictionless one . What with family strains and frustrated romances , there were plenty of obvious suspects . Semen was found on Worthington 's body , but it did not match any of them .
