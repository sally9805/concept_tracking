Martha Stewart has released her own impeccable bottle of dishwashing liquid too . <P> Then there are the gloves . Cobalt-colored TRUE BLUES may not sound like a luxury item , but the impenetrable , powder-free vinyl gloves are moving out of restaurant kitchens and onto stylish drainboards everywhere , even at $10 a pair . <P> And perhaps the most salient example of designer permeation of the most utilitarian products is the O-CEL-O hourglass-shaped sponge by 3M .
