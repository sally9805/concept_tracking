Watching the train roll out of the station , picking up speed , it occurred to me that I had been impetuous . Disappearing down the track , within that train , were the only human beings of my acquaintance in northern Italy  --  in all of Italy , for that matter , if you did n't count Guido , the ingratiating concierge briefly known at our hotel . My husband and his band of not entirely merry men were speeding away to Verona , to Milano , to Bologna , on and on until they would arrive in Roma , the Eternal City , in several weeks ' time . <br> And where was I ? <br> There was no sign that I could see on the narrow platform . It was , I think , the second stop the train had made since leaving Venice . Venezia the beautiful , the sinister , the enchanting city of water and light . Venice , the place I had not remotely experienced in the days I had just spent there . That 's how the argument must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , until I found myself there , outside the train . <br> And the argument ? I could n't remember . It hardly mattered , whatever it was , it was the same thing . It 's true , is n't it , that the long dispute that is marriage , for the unlucky anyway , loses its energy after a few years of failing to reveal much to anyone ? It loses its optimism , its hope of revelation ; the whole thing dissolves into a miasmic pall , a kind of weather . A miserable way to live . The damp penetrates the spaces between , then gathers and rains down the usual resentments , barely spoken , of no particular interest to anyone . Neither party seems to retain much apparent hope or regret , and that in itself is unbearable . So I could n't remember how it started , the blank amnesia of low-level numb despair brought on by these events . We spoke probably ; few words are necessary . I do remember the familiar sensation of gloom rising and the awful visceral sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if my body is trying to conceal itself in back of itself . Also the certain knowledge that there would be no help found in the present company . Encircling doom . I would sit in a bitter fog for however long it took to get to Verona . Lovely Verona , no doubt . Encountered in misery . One more unexperienced destination . <br> Then something unusual happened . I stood up , stepped over my husband 's long legs , not particularly carefully , dragged down whatever piece of my luggage was stashed above our seats , and got off the train . <br> That , after eight years of marriage , had taken a mere five minutes , the time required for the train to pull in , halt briefly , and pull out of the station . How ? What desperate , gagged Ariel in my beleaguered soul had struggled free in this lunge for the air ? And what did Antony think ? That I was still on the train ? Sulking in the club car ? <br> The train was gone . The track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an unoccupied green bench . I was aware of being marooned in every sort of emptiness . My suitcase looked unfamiliar . I felt light-headed and disoriented . The afternoon was blustery and threatening . Lightning actually cracked . <br> I did not speak Italian . <br> I pictured myself sitting in the now vanished train and felt like a ghost . <br> These regrets of mine , the previously mentioned problem with these trips , these tours , rather , was that we went to wonderful places , wonderful cities all over the world . We went , just as we went to Chicago and Cincinnati , and it made not a bit of difference wherever we might happen to be . It would always be a late arrival at an upscale corporate hotel , a five-star something that could be anywhere , room service , sleep , room service , sound check , performance , exhaustion , and moving on  --  or doing the same thing the next day , with a possible brief interval of shopping or lunch . I was not exhausted because I had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage to find transportation from a venue miles from the city to explore alone a place I 'd never seen . Though I longed to . The being-aloneness of the effort tended to overwhelm the impulse . Or had . <br> I am not well suited to be a solitary traveler . I 'm not gregarious , too cautious , too shy in a way , and had not usually , not ever , done the research necessary to enable me to move swiftly in determined pursuit of places of interest in a huge unfamiliar city . Also , I could n't see where the pleasure would be . That was what companions were for , no ? The whole day before us and what shall we do ? Companionship made all things possible , delightful , if I remembered . That was my fantasy anyway , time spent traveling to rise every day like a little cake , a treat to be savored . Companionship . That was the real issue , of course , disguising itself as another sort of deprivation , the deprivation of a glorious city unseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windshield , which had often , in fact , been literally the case . Oh , that was Brussels ? I wish it were n't dark . <br> I wish we could see it together . <br> Of course that was n't what we were there to do and I had no right to this self-indulgent resentment . I was free to do whatever I liked but other people were working . If I was so miserable , I could always stay at home and do whatever it is I do there . Or go home , for that matter . Life would go on ; I had a credit card . <br> I had a credit card . <br> It had begun to rain . I could n't just stand there for the rest of the day . Alone and palely loitering . <br> I did n't know the geography of Venice but felt sure I could locate the Gritti Palace Hotel , or someone could do it for me . A Doge 's palace . Truly , anciently Venetian . A dream . I would check in ; later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen tomorrow , and go to sleep . I did not miss the irony . I crossed the track and hailed the inbound train . <br> Not much could be viewed of the Grand Canal from the cabin of the water taxi ; the windows were curtained and opaque with steam . Outside the cabin door , water was everywhere , the only thing to see , above , below , huge sheets of spray to each side . A high-speed shipwreck , I thought . And then we were there . <br> The lobby of the Gritti Palace Hotel is neither palatial nor even particularly opulent ; it is , as it happens , cozy , small , and wood-paneled . Still , I sensed that one should sweep in here with an excess of expensive luggage and a retainer or two ; one should not be alone , apprehensive , and without a reservation . Nevertheless the desk clerk was charming and welcoming . My single suitcase was not embarrassing and I was dressed in black , the all-purpose disguise . Disguising what ? <br> He was sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one or two small rooms on the side of the building undergoing some renovation . Would that be all right for tonight ? He might be able to move me later . So relieved was I by his friendliness that I thanked him effusively and offered my credit card , saying it would be fine for me and how grateful I was to be able to stay . <br> It crossed my mind briefly to wonder what this might cost , even the small room . Antony would be disapproving . He would assume one of those disdainful , sour expressions that make even his face ugly . To indulge myself in this way ! If indulging myself was , in fact , what I was doing . On his money . Unspoken naturally . <br> And so I was shown to my accommodation . I had to laugh . The room was a cell . Tiny , a narrow bed , pretty furniture apparently , although it was hard to know since the single window was shuttered tight and only a dim lamp illuminated the gloom . The window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the shutters was frustrated by scaffolding pressing from the outside . A little five-star cave . No wonder the desk clerk was amused and accommodating . Or perhaps he was sincere about the move , but really , what did it matter ? The room had all the features of a hideout , and was n't that what I was doing , what I 'd done ? All I seemed to have achieved so far was an extemporaneous flight to a sumptuous little grotto like some decadent eremite on the run . I had no idea what I was doing . <br> The bed was hard , for which I was grateful . I wanted to wash away the travel film and think . The afternoon was getting on , the rain had stopped . Having come this far I felt I should at least set foot on the pavements of Venice , glimpse the famous light , but that would require going outside and I lacked the will . I had spent so many hours in hotel rooms , so many hours by myself , laying down my Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my enviable husband is out there somewhere and will come back . If only to get his clothes , as had sometimes crossed my mind . The shocking idleness of that life , the waiting , the emptiness , the pointlessness . As if I had been partially paralyzed . There is some sort of wasp , I think , who , already having enough to eat , paralyzes his victims to keep them fresh and immobile , ready and waiting , should his appetite return . A harem must be a similar event . <br> Antony was in Verona by now . I had his itinerary but he did n't have mine . Was he alarmed ? Annoyed ? Postponing a reaction until he checked in , worked out , and had dinner ? Until he found himself alone in his room , something he can hardly bear ? All performers , I suppose , have a double personality , but Antony 's seemed extreme . He was so glamorous and engaging onstage , so generous and embracing , boyish in some way but passionate , like a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I myself was still subject to that seduction when I watched from the wings . Here in Italy , a famous writer visiting backstage during a show only last week could hardly be restrained from flinging himself into what he called the " Dionysian heat " of the occasion . <br> Continues ...
