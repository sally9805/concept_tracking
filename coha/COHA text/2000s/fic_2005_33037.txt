Chapter One IN THE BAD MOUSE YEAR-two years after magazines claimed a white man hoofed on the moon-Enuk Wolfglove materialized one day in front of our house in the blowing snow and twilight of no-sun winter . His dog team vanished and reappeared in the storm . Abe stood suddenly at the window like a bear catching a scent . " Travelers ! " He squeezed out his half-smoked cigarette , flicked it to the workbench , wiped ashy fingers on his sealskin overpants . We kids eyed the cigarette 's arc-we could smoke it later , behind the drifts , pretend we were artists like him . " Poke up the fire ? " Abe grinned like an older brother , our best friend , no dad at all . " And hide the vanilla . " His head and broad shoulders disappeared as he squirmed into his shedding caribou-calfskin parka . He banged the door to break the caribou-skin stripping loose and jumped into the storm . Jerry pocketed the cigarette . He glanced up through his eyelashes . " I 'll share , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about travelers . We were barefoot and red toed . It was getting dark , and stormy , or we 'd all have dressed in parkas and hurried outside . Jerry lowered a log into the barrel stove . He got the second log stuck and had to wrench it back out , sparky and smoking . " Goddamn son of a biscuit ! " he said , practicing with Abe absent . He was tall and ten-twice my age-and had the good black hair . Also , he remembered cities and cars and lawns , red apples on trees-if that stuff was true . Jerry left the draft open until flames licked the pipe red and smoke leaked out the cracks . He tracked down each spark , wet his finger , and drowned it . He wiped his finger on a log , peered at it , and wet it again . Abe was spanking-strict about fire . That , and no whining . " It 's Enuk Wolfglove ! " Iris said . " Only one traveler ! " Through the flapping Visqueen window we watched Abe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the willows near our team . Enuk lived west , downriver in Takunak village , but like wind he came off the land each time from a different direction . Iris squinted , myopically counting his dogs . Abe would be too generous , offering too much fish and caribou off our dogfood pile that needed to last until Breakup . Iris felt bad if our dogs got narrow and had to eat their shit . She was eight now , black hair too , and with blue eyes-but they were weak . She had gotten snowblind , the spring before last when she did n't wear her Army goggles on the sled back from the Dog Die Mountains . Someday , Abe meant to mailorder glasses . I broke a chunk of thin ice off the inside of the window and sucked it . " How come they hitchin ' ' em there ? " The ice tasted like frozen breath and wet caribou hair . Jerry peered over our shoulders . " You 're talking Village English . Company is n't even off the ice . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made all of us nervous , except Iris . Our family lived out on the tundra . Abe had dug a pit , old Eskimo style , and built our igloo out of logs and poles , before I even grew a memory . Eskimos would n't live that way anymore , but for some reason we did . The single room was large , sixteen by sixteen , and buried to the eaves in the protective ground . In the back , over our beds , trees reached into the soil on the roof , and in the storms we heard their roots groaning , fighting for their lives out in the wind . Our walls and roof Abe insulated with blocks of pond sod . In the sod , mice and shrews rustled and fought and chewed and built their own homes , siphoning off warmth and mouthfuls of our food and winnowing it down to tiny black shits . Abe had escaped something , roads and rules possibly . Little things did n't bother him ; Abe liked his meat dried , cooked , raw , or frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the tiny maggots were n't moving . Once we had a mom . She was n't coming back . That 's what Iris said she told Jerry the day she flew away . She had a twelve-string guitar and apparently liked music more than caribou and bears and a moss roof that leaked . She 'd left us alone with none of those thousand warm things children with mothers do n't count . Abe never talked about it . He never painted it . Her leaving was the back wall of my memory . Iris scraped at the ice on the window with her fingernails inside her sleeve . Her bony elbows stuck out of her shirt . " They 're chaining below the willows so the drifts wo n't bury his dogs . " She flitted away to hang our parkas on pegs over the wood box , push mukluks and clothes tighter into the corners and under our bunks . Caribou hairs clung to all our clothes . She whisked hair and Abe 's plane shavings and sawdust into dirt corners with a goose wing . The north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bank where our sod home was buried in the permafrost . The skylight shuddered . Snow laced over the riverbank . The gray wool of moving snow hid the horizons . Overhead the frozen sky purpled with night , and above the wind and frantic branches clung watery stars . Out under the ice , the wide Kuguruk River flowed past the door , through the arctic part of Alaska that our mail-order schoolbooks called barren icy desert . That shamed me , that quick , throwaway description flung from the far rich East , printed in the black-and-white validation of a textbook . My protests only made Abe shrug . The homemade Visqueen window shivered and whacked . The men chopped a frozen caribou for the dogs . The dogs ripped the skin off the meat and swallowed chunks . They guarded the skin , pinning it down with their claws . When the last bone and meat crystal was sniffed off the snow , they chewed the hair off the skin , ate the skin . Then they curled up to protect their faces and feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eave , down into the trench to the door . The snow squeaked as Abe shoveled , then pounded on the skin door . " Chop the ice along the bottom ! Hear me ? " Jerry scrambled for the hatchet . " Now get back ! " Torn by wind and muffled by the skins , his voice came in mad . I hid behind the water barrel . Abe and Enuk surged in out of the swirling snow . Ovals of frozen skin and drifted-on ice whitened their faces . I stared , longing for frostbite , the scars of heroes . Abe pulled his hood back and his curly yellow hair sprang out ; his turquoise eyes shone above his bearded face . " Windy . " " Alappaa tat wind . " Enuk was a few inches shorter than Abe . His wide face was stiff , his goatee iced . The men grinned and shook snow off their parkas and whipped snow off their mukluks . They eased ice off their whiskers . Iris danced barefoot between them , smiling and scooping up snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could move like her , light and smiling . Behind the water barrel I stood on the dirt and the damp mouse turds , excited at having company . Enuk 's gaze swung and pinned me down . " Hi Yellow-Hair ! Getting big ! How old ? " His face was dark and cold-swollen . Travelers all carried names for me , like the first-class mail . None were the ones I wanted . I inched out beside the blasting stove , my eyes down . " Five . " It was hard to look at Enuk-or any traveler-in the eyes after seeing no people for weeks . It was hard to speak and not run and hide again . Enuk 's frost-scarred face betrayed mysteries and romantic hard times that drew a five-year-old boy with swollen dreams . He was muscled in the forearms in the way of a skinned wolverine . He did n't eat most store-bought food , except Nabob boysenberry jam . When he was out hunting with his dog team and snowshoes he carried a can of jam . He 'd chop it open and-after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his campfire he 'd suck on chips of frozen jam . He also carried his little moosehide pouch . Inside were secrets ; once he 'd let us hold gold nuggets , lumpy , the diameter of dimes . We handed them back and they disappeared in the folds of leather . The day I turned old I was going to be Enuk . Small discrepancies left footprints in my faith , such as the fact that he was Eskimo and I seemed to be staying naluagmiu . But years lined up ahead , promising time for a cure . Our last human visitor had been Woodrow Washington , a month before . Woodrow had a mustache and one tooth on the bottom , one on top . They did n't line up . Not near . His closest worldly ties were with the bottle , and that left him narrow and shaky . Though he hunted like everyone , his concentration and shots tended to stray . When he showed up , Jerry always hid the vanilla . Sober , he was nice and extra polite . " Tat Feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stayed only long enough for warmed-up breakfast coffee . " He use double-barrel , backa their outhouse . You got fifty dollar ? I sure need , alright ? " Abe gave him the money . Abe leaned on his workbench and rubbed his ears . Harry Feathers was-or had been-a shambling teenager with blinky eyes and acne . He talked to Abe when Abe was snacking our sled dogs in front of Feathers 's post office . It seemed as if maybe nobody else listened to Harry . Woodrow had been disappointing company . We had only what money was in the Hills Bros can , but I blamed him more for not spending the night . And not bringing our first class . Jerry served boiled caribou pelvis , in the cannibal pot , and pilot crackers , salmon berries , qusrimmaq , and the margarine that travelers had left-without the coloring added . Abe did n't allow something for nothing ; yellow dye was poison ; the color of food was nothing . We all carried sharp sheath knives forged out of old chisels and files and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pelvis bone . Afterward , for a while I forgot my shameful blue eyes and yellow hair when Enuk leaned back on the bearskin couch . He hooked his thumb under his chin . His gaze slid away , beyond the leaning logs of the back wall . His pleasant face might have said aarigaa taikuu , but what he did say was , " Tat time it blowing same like t is , up Jesus Crick I kill my dowgs . " I wiped my greasy hands on my pants and climbed onto his words as if they were a long team to pull me away to the land of strength and adultness . He whittled a toothpick out of a splinter of kindling . He let the chips spin into the darkness under the table to mix with the caribou hairs and black mouse turds that carpeted our hewn floorboards . Eskimos were n't like Franklin and Crazy Joe or other naluagmius who occasionally came upriver ; Enuk 's story was just to fill the night and he was n't afraid to let silence happen between words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hunched comfortable on the bank , enjoying what the current carried . With the stick , Enuk picked his teeth . He had most of his teeth , he said , because he never liked " shigger " or " booze . " I did n't know what booze meant and was scared to ask , vaguely convinced it might be something frilly that city women ordered out of the first half of the Sears catalog . I sat on the chopping-block stump and stared up into his face . Abe threw a log into the stove . Sparks hissed red trails up around his shaggy head and flicked into darkness against the low ceiling poles . The poles around the five-gallon-can safety hung with dust tendrils from past smoke . Smoke and the oily odor of flame spread in the room . Abe filled a kettle , making hot water for tea . Mice and shrews rattled spoons on the kitchen boards . " Wind blow plen'y hard tat night I get lost . Freeze you gon na like nothing . " Enuk nodded at our bellied-in plastic sheeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . A dwindling line of black night showed at the top . " My lead dowg , he been bite my dowgs . Al'uv'em tangle in'a willows . I leave ' em , let'um bury . I sleep in ta sled , on qaatchiaq . Tat night I never sleep much . " He chuckled and glared . " You listen , Yellow-Hair ? Ca n't see only nothing too much wind . " Enuk 's bottom lip was thick and dark and permanently thrust out . I laughed , shy , and slapped my grubby red feet on the cold floor and tried to push out my too-thin lip . In the corner on Abe 's spruce-slab bed , Jerry and Iris lay on his caribou-hide qaatchiaq playing checkers . " Rabies , " Jerry murmured . " His story 's going to have rabies . " She pinched him . " It 's your turn . " A shrew ran on the floor . Enuk 's black eyes followed it . He picked up the block of kindling and waited . Behind the wood box shrews whistled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops of his were marking-penned black , Iris 's red . " ' Kay then . King me . " They wore corduroy pants . The corduroy ridges were eroded off the knees , thighs , and butts . Iris had two belt loops cinched together with twine to keep her too-big pants up . Abe did n't encourage us to change clothes more than once a month . More than twice a month put a burden on everybody . He would n't say no , but the house was low and one room-the only place to get out of the weather for miles-and the faintest disapproval could hang in the air . The corner posts of Abe 's bed were weather-silvered logs , the tops bowled from use as chiseling blocks and ashtrays . Above the foot of his bed , his workbench was messy with empty rifle brass , pieces of antler and bone , rusty bolts , wood chips , and abandoned paintings , the canvas and paper bent and ripped by his chisels and heavy planes . Abe Hawcly was a left-handed artist . He was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him anything generic or fatherly , only Abe . Travelers called him that . By the time we realized what normal people did , years had hardened into history . Calling him Dad felt worse than shaking hands . " Enuk . Here . " Abe slid a mug across the uneven boards to the middle of the table . He rubbed his sore knee and sat and rolled himself a cigarette with one hand . " Kids , do n't worry about schoolwork tonight . " He waved his match out . Two joints of his ring finger had been swallowed by a whaling winch in Barrow . His hands were thick and red , paint dried in the cracks . They carved faces on scraps of firewood and drew whole valleys lurking with animals on cardboard boxes . " Ah , taikuu . " Enuk slurped the scalding tea that would have seared a kid 's mouth into mealy blisters . " My dowgs be funny tat night . Lotta growl . " Another night passed in his story . " How old were you ? " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blood stung my cheeks . Interrupting seemed worse than pissing your pants in front of the village schoolhouse . " Hush , Cutuk , " Jerry said . Iris giggled and pretended to bite her nails , both hands at once . Abe had a piece of caribou-sinew string in his fingers , and he began pulling loops through loops . A lead dog formed . He turned the wick down on the lamp . Storytelling shadows stretched farther out from the moldy corners . The wind gusted . The door was half buried . I pictured those yellow metal nuggets . Wondered if they were in Enuk 's pocket , and how young he 'd been when he found the first one . Enuk sipped . Continues ...
