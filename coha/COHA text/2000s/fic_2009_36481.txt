On Tuesday , October 5 , Skykomish County Sheriff Milo Dodge arrested Clive Berentsen , forty-one , in connection with the death of Alvin De Muth , thirty-eight . Dodge and Deputy Sam Heppner took Berentsen into custody at eleven-twenty-five pm . The timing was almost perfect , allowing me to include the story for The Alpine Advocate 's weekly deadline . <br> " I know KSKY has the news , " I said to my production manager , Kip MacDuff , the next morning , " but at least we got it in this week 's edition . " <br> Kip , who was pouring coffee from the urn behind my new reporter 's vacant desk , grinned . " There are some wars you ca n't win , Emma . " <br> " I know that , too . " I paused , contemplating our coverage of the homicide down the road . " I suppose Clive Berentsen will plead self- defense . Do you know Clive or Alvin De Muth ? " <br> Kip shook his head . " Only by sight . Clive 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done some work on our trucks , but I hardly ever talked to him . I guess he was the strong , silent type . " Kip smiled at me . " I do n't hang out at the Icicle Creek Tavern . Never was my style . If I want a beer , I go to Mugs Ahoy or our fridge at home . I 'm a respectable married man , remember ? " <br> I smiled back at Kip . He 'd worked for the Advocate since his high school days , starting out as a carrier and eventually taking over the paper 's production . He was now in his early thirties ; I 'd designated him as my heir apparent if and when I ever retired . <br> " You deserve a raise , " I said on impulse . " If we crunch some numbers . . . " <br> " Whoa . " Kip held up a hand . " I know the numbers as well as you do . The profit margin is pretty lean . Nobody here expects to get rich . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my House &amp; Home editor 's empty chair . " Where 's Vida ? It 's ten after eight . " <br> " She 's got the bakery run , " Kip replied , heading for the door to our back shop . " She traded with Mitch this morning . He had a problem at home and called to say he might not get here until eight-thirty . " <br> Mitch Laskey was my latest hire as the Advocate 's sole reporter . " Nothing serious , I hope ? " <br> " Ask Vida . " He chuckled . " She 's the one who knows everything , " he added , then disappeared into his high-tech domain . <br> Kip was right . Vida Runkel was the source of all knowledge in Alpine and the rest of Skykomish County . No secret was safe , no slip of the tongue went unnoticed , no vow of secrecy was sacred to my redoubtable House &amp; Home editor . She could be annoying , contrary , and even infuriating . But I 'd be lost without her . I owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the palm of her hand . <br> I 'd retreated to my cubbyhole office when she burst into the newsroom five minutes later . " No maple bars ! " she cried . " No sugar doughnuts ! What 's going on at the Upper Crust ? " <br> I rose from my chair and went to my almost-always-open door . " They ca n't make everything every day , " I pointed out . <br> Vida , who was wearing a toque plastered with artificial autumn leaves , tromped over to the table where the coffee urn was located . " True , but my mouth was set for a maple bar . " She began arranging the pastries on a tray . " Cinnamon doughnuts are good , so are the frosted kind , but I prefer raised sugar . Oh , well . " She finished her task and snatched up a blueberry Danish . <br> " What 's going on with Mitch ? " I inquired . <br> " His wife 's loom broke , " Vida replied en route to her desk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug for someone 's mid-October birthday in Kalamazoo . " <br> I perused the bakery goods . " So what do you think of Mitch ? " <br> Vida shed her new green raincoat ; the hat remained atop her unruly gray curls . " Competent . Pleasant . Good writing , fine pictures . Most of all , he 's mature , which was not true of his predecessor . " <br> " You 're right , " I agreed . " We 're lucky to get Mitch . I was afraid we 'd get stuck with another recent college grad . The scary part about hiring Curtis Mayne last spring is that he was the best applicant . " <br> " A disaster , " Vida murmured . " So irresponsible , a borderline mental case . " She sat down in her chair . " I listened to KSKY this morning . Spencer Fleetwood reported that Clive Berentsen will be charged with first-degree manslaughter . " <br> " Standard for a tavern brawl , " I said , selecting a cinnamon-sugar doughnut . " How come you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim or the alleged killer ? " <br> Vida 's expression was disdainful . " As you 're aware , I do n't associate with the type of people who spend Saturday nights at the Icicle Creek Tavern . Lowlifes , virtually all of them . I do n't understand why Milo did n't arrest Clive on the spot . " <br> " He wanted to be sure , " I said as my ad manager , Leo Walsh , came into the newsroom . " You know Milo  --  he always goes by the book . " <br> Leo made a mocking bow to greet Vida . She made a noise that sounded like a growl . During all the years they 'd worked together , the pair had conducted what might seem to casual observers like a simmering feud . I knew better . Beneath the gibes and jeers , they liked and respected each other . When Leo had almost died in July , Vida 's concern had been genuine . Indeed , she had n't criticized him for smoking when he returned to work two weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Berentsen whacking Whatshisname ? " <br> I nodded . " It sounds like the good old days  --  or bad old days , depending on how much you enjoy an old-fashioned tavern brawl . " <br> " Dreadful , " Vida remarked . " Yet part of Alpine 's history as a logging town . You both arrived too late for the timber industry 's heyday . " Her glances at Leo and me seemed almost pitying . " Unfortunately , it occasionally brought out the worst in some people . " <br> Leo , who was getting his coffee and a plain doughnut , chuckled . " Oh , yes . Harrowing tales of Saturday nights at both the Icicle Creek Tavern and Mugs Ahoy . Regular knock-down , drag-out affairs , especially at Icicle Creek . Was n't there another murder at one of those saloons a few years back ? " <br> Vida and I exchanged quick glances . We both remembered the victim , a young man who may or may not have deserved killing . " Yes , ten , twelve years ago , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can read all about it in back copies of the Advocate . " <br> Leo shook his head . " No thanks . I used to work in the LA area , remember ? " He turned back to Vida . " How long did they keep the windows boarded up because they could n't afford to replace them every month or so ? " <br> Vida heaved a big sigh . " At least a year after one fracas . On the weekends , whichever deputy was on night duty would cower outside in the patrol car , too frightened to restore order . Then there were the bikers who 'd roar into town thinking they could win a victory over the loggers . So foolish . The bikers were overmatched . " <br> I caught a hint of pride in Vida 's tone . As a native Alpiner , even the worst behavior could n't dim her high opinion of the town 's citizens . <br> Leo paused on his way to his desk . " I have to ask  --  did you ever go to the Icicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Vida scowled at the nickname she claimed to despise . " I most certainly did not , nor at any other time . " She paused , pursing her lips . " Well , once or twice , perhaps , but only in the line of duty . " <br> Before Leo could comment , Mitch Laskey arrived . " Sorry I 'm late , " he said in greeting . " Brenda 's loom had a tension headache . " <br> " Did you fix it ? " Leo asked . <br> Mitch settled his long and lanky form behind his desk . " Only time  --  and the results  --  will tell . The rug she 's making is wool . That 's good . If she was using linen or silk , it might be a bigger problem . " He leaned back in his chair and yawned . " Coffee . I need coffee . " He swiveled around and moved closer to the table . " So what do we have from the sheriff on this tavern murder ? " <br> I strolled over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Check with Dodge when you go through the log to see what crimes and misdemeanors the lesser locals have been nailed for . You should be at the courthouse when Berentsen is officially charged . " <br> " Got it . " Mitch had poured his coffee , but refrained from taking any of the bakery goods . My new hire rarely seemed to eat much , which , I supposed , accounted for his slim frame . <br> My phone rang . I hurried into my office to answer it before the call trunked over to our office manager , Ginny Erlandson . <br> Milo Dodge was on the line . " You sure about this new guy handling the murder ? " <br> " I told you already that he 's very experienced , " I replied , lowering my voice . " He 's not a raw recruit with a brand-new college diploma . Mitch worked twenty-five years for the Detroit Free Press . He could probably do this story with his eyes closed . He 's covered more homicides than the two of us put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning my judgment . <br> " If you say so . " Milo did n't sound convinced . " Alpine 's not Detroit . You know what happened with that last moron you put on the payroll . " <br> " Guess what ? " I snapped . " I do n't need reminding . Mitch will be at your office in ten minutes . When are you going to the courthouse ? " <br> " Nine , " the sheriff replied . " Got to run . Fleetwood 's here . " <br> The click in my ear riled me even further . Of course the voice of Skykomish County , Spencer Fleetwood , had shown up . Gloating , too , and suffused with more self-confidence than ever since he 'd gotten approval from the FCC to crank up KSKY 's transmission signal . <br> I got up and went to the doorway . " Mitch , the sheriff 's going to be at the courthouse in twenty minutes . " <br> " I 'm off , " he responded , taking a last gulp of coffee before grabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . <br> I started back into my office , but Vida , who had been on the phone , called to me . " Emma , that was Maud Dodd at the retirement home . She wanted to know if we caught the mistake in her weekly column about Milo 's aunt Thelma . Did you proofread it ? " <br> " I thought you did , " I said . <br> " No , no , " Vida replied . " It came in late yesterday just before I left to see the dentist . I put it on your desk . " <br> I grimaced . " I do n't remember seeing it . What 's wrong ? " <br> Vida was sitting back in her chair , fists on hips , frowning in concentration . " Oh , dear . Maybe I . . . " She reached for her out- basket . " Drat ! I mistakenly put it there for Kip . Ginny must 've picked it up and given it to him . " She flipped to page two of her copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's about Milo 's aunt and uncle  --  ' Thelma Petersen is enjoying her new residence here . Elmer is also enjoying himself , having taken an interest in the handmade holiday crafts Thelma has sold privately for lo these many years . The Petersens ' current project is fornicopias , a colorful display on any dining room table . ' " Vida tossed the newspaper aside . " I never should have insisted that Maud get someone to type her columns for her ! " <br> I did n't know whether to laugh or sympathize . " You did say you could n't read her spidery handwriting . " <br> Vida had taken off her glasses and was rubbing her eyes in a familiar and ferocious sign of distress . " Ohhh ! How embarrassing ! And how stupid of me to have mislaid the copy . " <br> I winced , certain I could hear her eyeballs squeaking in protest . " It happens , " I said . " You were in a hurry . " <br> " Inexcusable . " She 'd finally stopped punishing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo , " she murmured , glancing at his vacant chair . " Not to mention Milo and half the town . " <br> " You could always use it in next week 's ' Scene , ' " I said referring to Vida 's front-page one-by-three-inch gossip column . <br> " That 's not funny , " Vida retorted . " Maud will be humiliated . She 's so upset . She 's afraid she 'll be evicted from the retirement home . " <br> " Maud 's overreacting , " I pointed out . " Half the people who read her column at the retirement home wo n't get it . " I stopped just short of saying that the other half of the residents were either gaga or almost dead . The callous thought made me realize that I was n't in a very good mood . I changed the subject . " Fill me in , " I said , picking up Vida 's copy of the Advocate with its lead story under Mitch 's byline and a photo he 'd taken of the Icicle Creek Tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body lying halfway under the pool table with only his legs and lower torso showing . I 'd decided that was too grim for the front page . " I made sure he did n't use any quotes from the other patrons and kept just to the facts that Milo and Sam had given him . Being an old hand at covering homicides , he did n't need reminding . But down the road we 'll have to find out what the witnesses had to say about the incident . " <br> " Of course you will , " Vida said . " We 'd be a poor source of information if we avoided printing what the bystanders saw and how they responded . Human interest , that 's so important . " <br> What Vida really meant was that Alpine was agog , its residents waiting impatiently for reactions from their friends and neighbors . " The gossip mill is already grinding , " I said . " What have you heard so far ? " <br> " Well now . " She rested her elbows in the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engelman being there . Very unusual , since he never goes to the tavern . Of course it was his ex-wife 's birthday , so I suppose he felt an obligation to be with Janie instead of in jail . " <br> " Probably , " I allowed . " It 's ironic that the first time he shows up in months there 's a big brawl and a fatality . He would 've been better off spending the weekend in his favorite cell . " <br> " Perhaps . " Vida paused . " I rather admire Fred for acknowledging his problem with alcohol , but you 'd think he 'd join AA rather than checking himself into jail every weekend to avoid carousing and brawling . Admittedly , he never drank during the rest of the week while working for Blackwell Timber , but I do n't think Milo likes having one of his cells used on a regular basis . On the other hand , Fred 's always very good about keeping the place tidy . " <br> " A real plus , " I murmured . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand Fred does some chores at the sheriff 's office . He 's quite the handyman . I 've had him do some repairs at my house and I 've always been rather pleased , particularly with electrical problems . Oddly enough , he never wears gloves . He insists that the shocks he gets from live wires are invigorating . " <br> " As fun goes , I suppose that 's better than getting blotto on several schooners of beer . " I sat down in her visitor 's chair . " Fred and his ex , Janie , are on good terms ? " <br> Continues ...
