RELATIONSHIP therapists warn that looking for love with all the wrong people can lead to unnecessary heartbreak and unexpected headaches , such as losing your job , your house , your family , friends , good reputation and self-respect . No matter how you look at it , the experts say , some fantasies should never be fulfilled , that is , if you want to keep your life and your sanity intact . Headnote Yet , for many , it seems that the more forbidden the fruit , the more attractive it is . Some people throw common sense to the wind , tune out their self-accusing spirit and go for it . In some cases , true love prevails , but more often than not , the questionable relationship crashes and burns-and the fallout can hit the unsuspecting lovers like a two-ton truck . Take a hint from those who have risked it all before - like the Sister who left her husband of 20 years for the sweet-talking playboy , only to later find herself embarrassed and alone in the end . Or the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to become the laughing stock of the neighborhood when he catches her cheating on him . Or the long-distance kissing cousins who ca n't show their faces at the family reunion , or the newlywed and the best man-the list of scandalous seductions goes on and on . But if you listen to those who played the game and got burned , they 'll tell you that all is fair in love and war , and if the relationship appears to be too hot to handle , perhaps you should think twice . Here then are the five most dangerous liaisons . If your new crush falls under one of these categories , run , do n't walk , to the nearest exit . Photograph // 1 THE MARRIED MAN/WOMAN . To some folks , there is nothing more enticing than attracting someone else 's lover . For them , the challenge , the chase , the excitement and the lure of firecracker sex ( that only an otherwise unavailable mate could provide ) can be unmercifully tempting . But when the thrill is gone or the oft  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good times come to a screeching halt and one partner is left holding the emotional baggage . Experts say that when the affair ends , the prized stolen moments never seem to erase the pain of being deceived . Some people are duped into falling for a married person-some married people prefer not to wear wedding bands , and others tend to lie about their lives and their family . When the unknowing partners find out about the spouse , their hearts are already stolen and there 's nothing that they can do about it . New York psychologist Vera S. Paster , author of Staying Married : A Guide For African-American Couples , says the first way to avoid falling into this emotional trap is to ask your potential lovers if they are married , whether they are wearing a band or not . Next , believe little or nothing that married players have to say , because if they are unscrupulous enough to creep around , they will lie like a rug on the floor with nails in it to get what they want , she warns . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursues married men because such men who allow themselves to have alliances with other women usually are not available , " Dr. Paster explains . " They have fun , there 's the excitement of the romance , or the novelty of a different sexual partner , but these motivations do n't add up to serious commitment for a lifetime basis . Therefore , the woman who is probably more serious and hungry for love is left feeling demeaned and abandoned . Society is less likely to sanction such an adulterous relationship , so she 's completely humiliated . " Dr. Paster says the average man who chases a married woman does n't suffer as greatly , because he enjoys not being forced to commit to his already married lover . Some commitment-shy men date married women to avoid being pressured into a serious relationship , says Anthony P. Young , national president of the Association of Black Psychologists . But he says those who seek unavailable partners are being unrealistic about the consequences . " Oftentimes when people go after a married person , it 's in their mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a relationship without getting too serious , " Dr. Young explains . " But some unhappily married people do want to pack up and leave their spouses for their lover . If individuals feel they can engage in a relationship with a married person solely to avoid making a commitment , they are living a myth . " 2 THE EX FACTOR . When one suffers a setback in the pursuit of a new relationship , familiarity can become a great soother of the soul . Selective amnesia sets in , and it 's very easy to look back on a past relationship through rose-colored glasses , that is , remembering the roses of the relationship and forgetting the painful thorns . " People forget the part of the relationship that did not work for them and then they reconstruct history , " Dr. Paster says . " They tell themselves it 's going to work this time around . ' But those who chase failed past relationships are gluttons for punishment . " Or perhaps people return to a past relationship because that 's where they left their heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes so long for people to break free of past relationships because they do n't take their heart with them when they leave , and the basic nature of most people is to return to the place where they left their heart , " he says . " When you terminate a relationship you must release yourself and take your heart with you . Sever all ties and move on . " Dr. Smith also believes that ex-lovers ca n't be friends while the wounds are still fresh , because realistically , " you ca n't be friends with someone you still love . " Love is not the only reason people return to an old relationship . Dr. Young says people return to past relationships because of loneliness ( some people become so accustomed to being with the ex that they feel inadequate without them ) , guilt ( people feel the need to make amends ) , or they are determined to change their ex-partner 's bad behavior . He says whatever the reason for backtracking , in the end , nothing good comes out of most past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph // " It 's not a wise decision to recycle relationships because the same problem that led to the breakup may continue to persist , " Dr. Young stresses . He warns that some past relationships should be avoided at all costs . " Never return to a relationship where any type of abuse ( emotional , verbal , physical , or sexual ) occurred . Stay away from individuals who do not respect you , " he says . " It makes no sense to engage yourself with someone who humiliates you or lacks respect for you . You are letting them demolish your self-esteem . " 3 THE LEFTOVER LOVER . So , maybe it 's not your ex who has been turning your head lately-maybe you have your eyes on your best friend 's ex  --  girlfriend . Bad , bad move , the experts say-this is definitely one fantasy that is better left alone . " Family and friends are hidden treasures , " Dr. Smith says . " We need to seek them out and enjoy their riches . To have a relationship with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the process , you may sever relationships with the people who are most important . " Dr. Young says the social ramifications of dating the ex of a friend or family member are great . " In our community , it is taboo to engage with the girlfriend or boyfriend of a friend or family member , " he says . " And if you 're going with someone , it 's highly inappropriate to break up with them and then involve yourself with their best friend . One of the consequences of this is that friends and family may perceive you as untrustworthy . " Dr. Paster adds that even if you are given consent to date someone else 's ex , the new union could feel strained , and may not blossom into a serious , committed relationship . " Even if the former lover and the good friend forgives or forgets , the person who 's pursuing or dating the ex will somehow feel that he or she should n't be , and it puts a barrier in the relationship , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifelong commitment because there is too much guilt involved . " 4 DATING THE BOSS . All right , Cupid 's arrow struck the cutie pie in upper management . He 's a hardworking , professional and highly intelligent Brother . He comes to work dressed to impress , wearing his Sunday best , and his tailored suits and polished shoes tell you that he does n't settle for less . You 're stuck in the office with him for a full eight hours a day , forced to smell his sweet cologne and laugh at his witty remarks . Finally , Mr. Broad Shoulders asks you out . What do you do ? If you 're like many single professionals , you hook up . It 's true that some serious-minded men find their future spouses on the job and live happily ever after . But the others ' ' - the corporate Casanovas-sole intention is to spread their love on every floor . And only when you 've been played do you realize what a mistake it is to mix business with pleasure . Now you spend your days ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( b. ) wondering if he let the cat out of the bag about the two of you ; and ( c. ) trying to salvage your reputation in the face of your suspecting co-workers . " I would not recommend an office romance , " Dr. Young says bluntly . " Coworkers who are involved romantically will suffer the social challenges of having to see each other every day at work , and then again after work . And oftentimes , the personal involvement will spill over into their workplace interaction . " There 's good reason as to why mama warned you never to get your honey where you make your money . A failed office romance can cost you your reputation , a promotion , or even your job . Experts say that if you date a married co-worker or boss , things can get especially nasty at work . " In most organizations , a high degree of professionalism and discretion is expected of the staff , and one does n't get that kind of respect if there 's an affair going on , " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons is married . That is so enticing for others to talk about that it wo n't be possible to hold your head up and ignore the gossip . " Being the subject of water-cooler gossip is a heavy burden to bear , but dating and dumping a boss is a totally different beast . A dumped boss can have the ex demoted , or downsized , and a spurned subordinate can wage a sexual harassment suit against the boss and the entire company . Because of this , many companies document , regulate , or to some extent , prohibit on  --  the-job affairs . 5 LOVING THY NEIGHBOR . There 's nothing more romantic than winning the heart of the girl-next-door-this very conquest has been the foundation of scores of novels , movies and love songs throughout the annals of time . You 've watched her up close and personal for some time , and now you 're ready to make your move on this neat , sweet and convenient cutie pie . When the relationship is good , all is well at your home and hers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , the convenience that you once savored could prove to be too close for comfort , says Dr. Smith . Photograph // " Dating means that you are in the exploratory stage and there is no commitment . If you 're just dating your neighbor , that may mean that she 's dating people other than you . And who wants to know when there 's someone else pulling up in the driveway ? " Dr. Smith asks . " Your ego will not allow you to sit there when you know that someone else is over there with your woman . You 'll find yourself sitting up all night madder than hell . " Dr. Paster says the verdict is out on whether or not Sisters should look for love so close to home . She says dating a neighbor could be problematic , but it also might lead to true love , depending on the couple 's chemistry and the maturity level of the persons involved . " I would date a neighbor if he was n't attached ; a good man is hard to find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy who moves in next door and he looks good and you start to meet each other and talk go for it . " But if things go downhill , be prepared to suffer the consequences , Dr. Paster adds . " You 'll suffer a lack of privacy , because that person is in a position to know who 's coming and going or if someone stays overnight , " she says . " Stalking you would be easy . And if it was a particularly nasty breakup , you 'll find yourself keeping odd hours so that you do n't run into each other in the elevator or in the hall . " The experts contend that you 'll be more successful in finding your soul mate if you opt for meeting people in more promising situations . Dr. Young says finding Mr. and Ms. Right can be simple-just visit places that provide a positive social service . Dr. Paster says single Sisters and Brothers should be creative when looking for the mate of their dreams . " I had a client who told me that she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local hospital , and she married a doctor , " Dr. Paster recalls . " I had another client who took sailing classes to meet eligible men . There are plenty of men who sail , and more than likely , they are financially stable . She found an exciting man and they had several wonderful years together . If you want to meet men , become active in your political party ; just do something where there is likely to be a male-dominated atmosphere . " The same is true for Brothers who are on the lookout for that one good woman . She can be found in the gym at her weekly aerobics class , at the grocery store , library , jazz concert , museum or culture club . The sweet irony of it all is that by increasing your presence at church , school , the library or museum can actually result in self-improvement , and before long , that special person you 're looking for will be out looking for you . <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
