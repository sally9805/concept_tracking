Marion Jones , one of the world 's loveliest women and demonstrably the fastest , is sitting before a mirror having makeup applied  --  a superfluous act . She is being prepped for the first of two shoots she will submit to this afternoon . Hotshot photogs have been flown in from the States because Jones has agreed to give them some of her time  --  and time is precious in the world of Marion Jones . Every minute between now and Sept. 22 has been carefully planned . <P> On that Friday , at 10 a.m. , the timing will become even more precise . The starter gun 's first bark will launch Jones on a nine-day offensive at the Olympic Stadium in Homebush Bay . Her schedule will be excruciatingly divided and subdivided , etched ultimately by split thousandths of a second . She 'll try to win five gold medals , negotiating an intricate shoal of qualifying heats , medal races , meals , catnaps , jumps and baton passes . Five golds in one Olympics has not been done by a track athlete since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1924 . Weeks before the opening ceremony , Jones is already the story of the Games . <P> This happens sometimes : an athlete announces a bid for multiple medals and lays siege to the spotlight . Spitz , Heiden , Lewis , Blair . Michael Johnson with his 200-m/400-m double an Olympiad ago . " It 's great to be the headliner , " says Johnson , who seems relieved that he qualified to run only the 400 m this time around . " But it 's very intense , an awful lot of pressure . " <P> " I 'm trying to not get into the hype , " says Jones as her cheeks are dusted . " I think I 've done a good job with the pressure  --  so far . " The French makeup artist looks Jones up and down and jabs for her knees with the powder puff . " Zis heeere ? " Jones ' knees are singed with burns caused by taking a sprinter 's stance on the coarse surface of the track dozens of times each day . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's me . " <P> Jones is always sweet and usually emphatic . She is asked as she sits there whether her storied **30;11991;TOOLONG ? confidence has been overhyped . Her answer is delivered without a trace of meanness , but it is definite : " I do see it like that  --  that I 'll win . When people are taken aback by that , I 'm surprised . I would hope those women you saw racing against me last night are going to the Games to win . I do n't know how realistic it is for everybody , but ... " <P> Here 's how realistic it is in the sprints . The night before , this rippled 5-ft. 10-in. racing machine ran away with her opponents ' gold-medal dreams before 70,000 track-crazed Belgians . Jones , not known for her starts , popped the second fastest reaction time in a nine-woman field and plowed through a headwind to a 10.83 clocking to win the 100 m . In Zurich a few weeks earlier , she had a terrible start , then chased down the pack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones is slow out of the blocks , she wins . When she 's fast , there 's no contest . Her rivals are left without solutions , short of finding a Tonya Harding among them to execute some kneecapping . In Brussels the women hung around after the race muttering about a quick gun , doing what they could to keep their heads in the game .
