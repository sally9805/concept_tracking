Part One // It has sometimes taken me ten years to understand even a little of some important event that happened to me . Oh , I could have given a perfectly factual account of what happened but I did n't know what it meant until I knew the consequences . - KATHERINE ANNE PORTER // A Dangerous Summer 's Night // Poised on that twilight edge between life and death , I felt intimately the part of me that was flesh , and I knew also that I was something more . // I came to that insight early on . I was scarcely twenty . // IT WAS 1977 , a drought year in the American West , the driest year in recorded history , although history in those parts went back only a hundred years . // Back then , all of America was in a drought . The fever dream of the sixties had simmered down and the country had lost its way . The national mood was dispirited , in recovery from shocks and traumas , pinched by stagnation and inflation . Fatalism shadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . But I did n't care . I was riding a bike . // America was hardly past its two hundredth birthday as I was nearing my twentieth . Its bicentennial year called for celebrations to restore a sense of the nation 's magic and promise . Out of that came a bicycle trail , the BikeCentennial , forged from coast to coast through America 's most spectacular countryside . My college roommate and I were riding the trail on our summer vacation . Encouraged by the 1970s culture to strive for self-discovery , we were hoping that the song of the open road would enlarge life 's meaning . // In the Cascades of the Northwest , drought conditions were melting the glaciers left from the last ice age . The mountain passes cleared unusually early in the summer of ' 77 and allowed us to scale the highest pass . On the seventh day of our journey , we rode up through green rain forest . At the summit , a field of lava , night-black , surrounded us from every direction , as if a devastating fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heights , we headed down . Trees abruptly appeared again . Only now they were reddish desert trees . // We set up our tent along a river in a small park in a desert of juniper and sage , and bedded down for the night . It was Wednesday , June 22 , the summer solstice . As the earth slowly turned in the dark , Americans in one time zone after the next settled in front of their TVs , safe in their living rooms . They watched the CBS Wednesday-night movie , the world television premiere of a dark and unsettling Western , one of those edgy films made in the seventies that reflected the mood of national cynicism . It was a film complete with psychopaths and moral degeneracy , a new American mythology that turned the romantic version of the Old West on its head . // The sound of screeching tires woke me . It was near midnight , and we had just gone to sleep . A stranger deliberately drove over our tent , then attacked us both with an axe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who looked like he had stepped off a movie set . // My great voyage across America ended abruptly there . And that was how I reached young adulthood , with a certain knowledge of life at its farthest edges . // Its Long Life // I entered young adulthood with a story that cast a spell on me . The details of the attack and of how we managed to survive gave me a dramatic tale to tell . But to make a full accounting of this event and its aftershocks seemed for many years impossible . Could I ever apply meaning to what had long seemed a senseless act , one that happened without pattern or reason ? Was there even a " why " to it ? // It took fifteen years before I finally realized that a long-ago incident had transformed me , divided my life into a before and an after . My personal history bewildered me , but two questions kept surfacing . The first was elusive : How could I get the recurring dreams to stop , the ones that haunted me through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty , unable to progress to another stage of life ? What dislocation of spirit had arrested a part of my psyche ? // The second question was easier to grasp : Who was the man who emerged that night in a desert park , bent on destruction ? This question had but one simple answer : an individual with a name . A man with his own history-a past , a present , and , impossible to imagine , a future . Fifteen years had passed , and the crime had never been solved . Its reckoning was long overdue . // Both questions converged in a flashbulb image that struck deep into my memory : the headless torso of a fit , meticulous young cowboy suspending an axe over my heart . The image conjured for me a villain out of myth and legend . // I began an education in such mythic imagery early on , when for my fourth birthday I received a 3-D Viewmaster that came with a package of sample discs . I remember holding the Viewmaster to my eyes and clicking the button on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of beautiful American landscapes and frames of iconic American imagery until I froze at one : a headless torso wearing a costume out of the Old West , a holster slung around his waist , his hand training a revolver on me , the viewer-which , in its startling three-dimensionality , forced me to stare down the gun 's cold gray barrel . // The image stayed with me until that summer of ' 77 , when I conflated in my mind what I remembered from my childhood toy , a cowboy torso trying to shoot me , and what I actually saw in the flesh . The memory of my attacker-that cowboy torso trying to axe me-crystallized at the margins of my consciousness as the nocturnal visitation of a villain out of legend . // It was the gripping power of this image that would compel me to set out to solve a crime-one that I hoped could solve me. // IN 1999 , I RETURNED to the scene of the incident , a place in the Oregon desert called Cline Falls . The visit turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trauma of the attack , now I was keen to see . What was the panorama that surrounded me ? What lay across the river and across the highway ? Who else happened to be in Cline Falls Park that night ? Who lived in the surrounding ranches , and in the town four miles away ? Who were the souls of this rugged community of the American West : the courageous ones who rescued us that night ? the passive ones who would n't speak up ? // I took frequent journeys back to the scene of the crime over a period of several years , and the questions continued to unfold . Why did the community still remember an event from long ago as though it happened only yesterday , as if it were an open wound ? Why did some tell me that the event had devastated them ? Why were others indifferent ? And what about the people who , I would discover , claimed they knew the identity of the attacker all those years ? // Conversations were seldom journalistic interviews . Often they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers . People were , for their own reasons , eager to look through my eyes , and into what might have been my last moments-sometimes it was a far-out symbol of their own worst trauma , which if not life-threatening was at least soul-diminishing . They answered my questions ; they made valiant attempts to resurrect the past ; they helped me with my investigation , which they understood as my personal mission . When I met someone for the first time , I learned always to begin with the story . // I realized the tale I had to tell was n't mine alone . The events of that long-ago summer night had driven deep into others in that desert community . Mine was not a solitary , isolated experience in one person 's life . It was a collective experience , even for those who had n't witnessed it . On some subterranean level it was as though they were waiting for me to return , to tap their potent remembrances , and by doing so to bring some kind of integration to a memory that never fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my personal history over many years of returning to Oregon , questions kept arising , still more troubling questions that brought to the surface the violent and extreme in our culture . The first time around , America 's dark underside found me . Later , I went looking for it . And it was n't hard to find . Of all developed nations , America is especially violent . It is violent by habit . My 3-D Viewmaster warned me of this when I was just four years old . // But I also found the other extreme . John Steinbeck said it just right in The Grapes of Wrath , our archetypal tale about lost American dreams : strange things happen to people in America . Some bitterly cruel . And some so beautiful that faith is retired forever . // The First Years // Fifteen long years elapsed between the attack itself and my compulsion to investigate it . It was a period of dormancy - incubation for what was to come later . // At first , I wore my story like an odd appendage , a Siamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freaky to ignore , yet not incorporated in any way into the rest of my life . Instead of pursuing its deeper implications , I would trot out the pain in my past for dramatic purposes . The cicatrix that snaked around my left forearm mellowed from scarlet to rose , but it was still strikingly visible when I rolled up my shirtsleeves . " It 's a perfect axe cut , " I 'd say to those bold enough to ask , explaining that the coil around my left forearm was not a surgical incision , but the precise tracing left by an axe-wielding maniac whom I encountered one night . I knew that few people would have an opportunity to view such a thing in their entire lives , and I wanted them to appreciate fully this door into the dark . Then I might be inspired to uncloak the whole collection of hidden scars : ridges in my right shoulder where the truck first struck my body- " tire treads etched into my skin , " I would explain-and the knob in the middle of my collarbone where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half of chest span . Pulling up the bottom of my shirt , I would reveal a line of gentle bumps where the ribs had snapped in half . // There was nothing in my appearance to say " victim . " The contrast between my bright , open face without a blemish and the concealed scars made for great mystery . I could keep my picturesque scars hidden . Or raise a curtain on them as I wished . They were great show-and-tell , visual aids for " The Story " of just how they had arrived on my body . // The story was both my grand disclosure and my secret . I had no qualms about blurting it out to strangers . But I was more secretive with new friends . For them , my narration was an initiation . I withheld it sometimes for months , until new friends turned into good friends-then I 'd pop the story on them , suggesting that I was infinitely more complex than they had ever imagined . I formed bonds according to how they reacted . A particular empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love affair . I 'd form a special rapport-it seemed a predestined friendship-if someone remembered the incident from the media attention it got in 1977 , as it was reported in newspapers across the country and broadcast by Walter Cronkite himself , a fact I did n't mind noting . I knew I had a good tale , but I did n't understand precisely what listeners found compelling other than the obvious sensational details , nor did I have the insight to comprehend my nagging compulsion to tell it . // In the early years , I narrated my story with great levity , punctuating the recitation with laughter , a breezy chirp in my voice . I did n't catch on that it was not only the tale itself but also my way of telling it that left my listeners with queer scrutinizing expressions on their faces . As I progressed through the cheerful beats of my narrow escape , I got to the part where I described the condition the axe-man had left me in : I had no movable arms . I described myself , with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them to do , as a " scarecrow . " I even would picture Ray Bolger singing and dancing . // IN HINDSIGHT , I can see that the dispassionate way I told the story ( and the scarecrow image ) was , in the therapeutic idiom , a dissociative numbing similar to how some war veterans I 'd heard about would spin their battle stories-but it was also a metaphor offered up from the deep folds of the psyche . I had split into two distinctly separate selves that summer night in June 1977. // There was the official self : the bright and independent woman right out of Yale , an aspiring artist in New York City , coming of age with the rest of her babyboom peers , playing at being hip , trying to develop social poise , personal charm and style , and striving with ambiguous direction to fulfill that singularly twenty-something desire to make something of herself overnight . True , my upper body was torqued , concave ; my breathing was fast and shallow from bearing the weight of an invisible truck ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so stiff I could n't grasp the loops that hung from the ceilings of the subway cars I took each day . And I would freeze while crossing city streets if a car came on too fast . Still , I fancied myself no different from the rest of my ambitious peers , and I tripped about the metropolis day and night thinking that this shining city , with its canyons of tall buildings that glittered with sun by day and then turned black and mysterious by night , where one had the sense that marvelous life-altering events might happen at any moment , held all the promise befitting my destiny . // But there was also a scarecrow self-an unacknowledged , angry , aggrieved shadow , who lived in a scarecrow body . It was plotting from the beginning to sabotage the other self . That took a long time . But , meanwhile , she was sending messages in a bottle . // The way a psyche tries to make sense of things , the way it tries to stitch itself back together after a violent criminal attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This other creature spoke an odd language-an encrypted language of unconscious knowledge , calling out to be recognized : // She must be the one who scrawled a mysterious reference in my daily calendar for 1980 , on the day of July 24 . Murder in the Met , she wrote . Today , I only vaguely remember what this news story referred to . A young ballerina ambushed by a malevolent janitor backstage after hours ? It 's a strange reference in this calendar , which otherwise is filled with notations of every lunch , brunch , and dinner date , every book read and movie seen , every incident that might possibly be relevant to a young artist in New York City in the early 1980s . But it is surely there : Murder in the Met , scribbled next to the notation about my having taken in the Picasso exhibit at MOMA . // Certainly it was this exiled self who , after I wrote an article for a magazine about the mysterious death of a model who fell from the window of a fashion photographer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal about the incident , a quote from the girl 's autopsy report : The entire body is covered with a thin film of black dirt . She was also the one who jotted , in the midst of other journal entries about my various attempts at dating , an isolated reference , apparently apropos of nothing : The smell of my blood-encrusted body . // Some motivation from this unknown district of the mind , from the porous unconscious , inspired me to perform the curious ritual of rummaging through the closet of my Brooklyn brownstone apartment looking for a bag stashed there . I would yank the fabric out of the sack until it unfurled on my living room floor : the mummy sleeping bag , the same one that three years before , when the police gave it back to me , I had instructed my father to wash in a Laundromat , so that the surf of pink suds slapping against the round glass porthole of the washing machine might restore it to a usable condition . I 'd search the bag 's silky interior to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only I could identify . I wished there were more of them , and bigger . What might be repellent to most-were there others who would save the very sleeping bag they were almost murdered in ? - was oddly satisfying to me . I was n't afraid of the blood . I had developed an overnight fearlessness about blood . Reconnecting with it filled me with a contentment I could n't comprehend then and did n't question . Blood was no longer " gore " to me . It was life itself . I would hold the fabric to my nose and try to recall the singular smell-like copper pennies held in a damp palm . //
