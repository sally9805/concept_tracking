THE STREET 59 <p> The man in the cutaway dances with his doll . The tape machine <p> plays " In The Still of the Night . <p> " The street is completely empty except for the dancer . <p> Nicky , a small paper bag in his hand , reenters his father 's <p> building . <p> 60 INT . MICHAEL ROGAN 'S LIVING ROOM 60 <p> The room bears some resemblance to the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the sofa , weary . <p> Nicky is taking an athletic bandage  --  about four feet long <p> and three inches wide  --  out of the package . <p> He sits in a chair that is set perpendicular to Michael 's end <p> of the sofa , so that Nicky is looking at his father in <p> profile . <p> # MICHAEL # <p> Why does n't he come live with us ? ' <p> Because everything is here . <p> # NICKY # <p> I know , Pop . <p> # MICHAEL # <p> I 'm lucky they do n't knock down the <p> building . It could happen anytime . <p> And everything worth remembering is <p> right here . <p> # NICKY # <p> I think the building 's okay . At <p> least for the time being . <p> # MICHAEL # <p> You did n't think it was okay when <p> you lived here . You wanted to get <p> out so fast I thought you were <p> running a marathon . <p> # NICKY # <p> Normal boy 's ambition . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICHAEL # <p> You tell your friends your father <p> used to work the docks . Callused <p> hands . But you had an attitude when <p> you were growing up that was n't <p> easy for your mother and me to <p> understand . <p> Nicky is gradually unbuttoning his father 's shirt so that he <p> can wrap the bandage around the old man 's chest and back . <p> # NICKY # <p> I was in a hurry to do big things , <p> make big mistakes . Any mistakes <p> were okay as long as it was big . <p> But I 'm trying to see these things <p> clearly and honestly . That 's the <p> play they 're going to kill starting <p> tonight . There 's a guy out there <p> getting ready to rip it apart . And <p> that 's us . Who we were and where we <p> come from . <p> # MICHAEL # <p> So what are you going to do about <p> it ? <p> # NICKY # <p> What do you want me to do ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nicky takes off the shirt . <p> Michael struggles out of his T-shirt and we see that he is <p> wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost . <p> He is sitting with his head tilted up , eyes closed , and is <p> unaware that he is wearing the bandage . <p> Nicky takes the new bandage , winds it tightly and puts it <p> back in the box . <p> His father has gone to sleep . <p> 61 EXT .

He opens the cabinet door , slides out a drawer and removes some hand towels . There is something there he wants Nicky to see . An old pockmarked revolver . <p> Nicky sees the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in a <p> pool . <p> # ELLIOT # <p> ( quoting ) <p> The most interesting thing about <p> Elliot Litvak is that he writes the <p> way he looks  --  fuzzy , grubby and <p> shifty-eyed .

But she <p> would n't tell me who . <p> # NICKY # <p> Had to be him . <p> # ELLIOT # <p> She was very evasive . <p> Nicky gets out of the chair . Dodgie removes the sheet for him and Elliot smooths down his clothes and hair , like a pair of grooms attending a warrior . <p> Nicky goes to the cabinet , gets the gun . He returns to the chair . <p> # NICKY # <p> I 'm enjoying this more every <p> minute . <p> Elliot takes an after-dinner candy out of his pocket  --  the <p> candy he pocketed in the Italian restaurant after lunch .

' <p> # NICKY # <p> I went to college in Boston so I <p> could be near the Red Sox . I took <p> summer classes and the cut them to <p> go to the game . My wife is from <p> Boston . Lillian Ziegler ? <p> # STEVEN # <p> The Red Sox were my world . I <p> surrendered my existence to a team <p> that could n't win the big one . <p> # NICKY # <p> If you 're such a devoted fan , why <p> were you at the play tonight <p> instead of the game ? Answer <p> carefully . This is important . You <p> could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no game last <p> night . <p> # STEVEN # <p> Because I ca n't bear to watch . When <p> they lose , I die inside . It 's like <p> some little person named Steve just <p> crumples up and dies . I wait for <p> the scores . I still die , hearing <p> the scores , but it 's over in a <p> second . I ca n't survive the game <p> pitch by pitch , inning by inning . <p> I 've done it too many times . And I <p> ca n't do it anymore . <p> Nicky lowers the gun . <p> # NICKY # <p> I was six years old the day Pesky <p> hesitated throwing home and <p> Slaughter scored all the way from <p> first . That 's when I knew the Red <p> Sox were my team . Pity and terror . <p> # STEVEN # <p> When I traveled through Asia this <p> summer , I went to tremendous <p> trouble and expense to rent a car <p> with a phone so I could call up <p> Sports Phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove through the war <p> in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone <p> like every hour on the hour , for <p> updates . <p> # NICKY # <p> What about my play ? <p> # LAUREL # <p> Yes . And no more evasive tactics . <p> # STEVEN # <p> It 's your best play , Nicky . <p> # LAUREL # <p> See , Daddy . <p> # STEVEN # <p> I 've seen it twice . I went back <p> tonight to be sure . It 's a brave <p> and honest piece of work . <p> # LAUREL # <p> What else ? <p> # STEVEN # <p> An artistry and sensitivity you 've <p> never shown before . <p> # NICKY # <p> And you 're not saying that because <p> of the gun in my hand ? <p> # STEVEN # <p> You 're out of bullets . <p> Nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and pulls the trigger . A click . <p> # LAUREL # <p> See , Daddy . <p> # STEVEN # <p> And Peter Redmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made us wait and wait . He <p> built a gorgeous tension and <p> suspense . <p> # NICKY # <p> We worked very hard on the pauses . <p> Nicky places it on the counter . <p> # STEVEN # <p> I called Sports Phone from Lhasa , <p> Tibet . Freezing in my little rented <p> Fiat . Sheep on a hillside . Rocky <p> debris dating back millions and <p> millions of years , from the time <p> the Himalayas thrust up when the <p> plates of India and Asia collided . <p> Red Sox 3 , White Sox 2 . A moment in <p> the history of the world . <p> Nicky takes Steven 's head and moves it tenderly against his <p> chest . When Nicky releases the head , he has Steven 's toupee <p> in his hand . He looks at it briefly , then hands it to Laurel . <p> 112 EXT. 48TH STREET NEAR ELEVENTH AVENUE 112 <p> A yellow taxi comes speeding past , moving eastward on 48th <p> Street . We see it from various perspectives and elevations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing moving in the <p> night . Steam comes billowing from funnel vents . The taxi <p> catches every light just before it turns red . <p> 113 INT . TAXI 113 <p> Nicky is driving , his face showing intense satisfaction . <p> Laurel sits next to him . <p> Driver 's name plate  --  <p> # MEMLUK # <p> # SULEYMAN # <p> The driver sits in the middle of the rear seat , looking <p> somewhat nervous . <p> # LAUREL # <p> Faster , Daddy . <p> 114 EXT. 48TH STREET 114 <p> The taxi crosses Park Avenue , speeding past the bronze statue <p> of a man hailing a cab . <p> It approaches First Avenue , where a road divider bisects the <p> thoroughfare . Nicky swings into a sharp turns , barely <p> averting contact with the divider , and stops abruptly . <p> Three doors open . On the empty street , Nicky hands the driver <p> a wad of bills . Then he and Laurel step over the divider . He <p> puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The sun begins to climb out of the East River . <p> # THE END
