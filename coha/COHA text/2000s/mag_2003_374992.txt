Two cycles of irrational exuberance in the U.S. economy , and we still do n't know what to make of it . First came the High Reagan years , with their masters of the universe , then the virtual economy , with all those make-believe billions . Were they just the latest outbursts of the usual hubris , the Yankee peddler spirit on a very big tear ? Or were they a sea change , episodes that launched us into a new world ? <P> Now two major U.S. novelists are taking on this question in two utterly different books . In Good Faith ( Knopf ; 417 pages ) , Jane Smiley has produced an irresistible novel of bad manners , a meditation on love and money that Jane Austen might have enjoyed , if she could have handled the sex . Don DeLillo , a man bidding hard , and sometimes plausibly , for the title of great American novelist , is operating at a much higher level of abstraction . In fact , he aims so high in Cosmopolis ( Scribner ; 209 pages ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore . <P> Smiley , who deals in dry comic realities , stays closer to ground . It 's 1982 , and the savings and loan industry has just been deregulated . Joe Stratford is a divorced , fortyish realtor in a semi-rural New Jersey township that 's evolving into a yuppie suburb . He has a modest condo and a good enough real estate business . In time , he also has a head-spinning affair with a married woman . <P> This is all enough for some low-intensity happiness until his world is rocked by Marcus Burns , a confidence man with Jay Gatsby 's tailoring but not his supernal grace . Burns is the kind of man who takes the real out of real estate . What he sells is dazzle , cutting ethical corners so carefully they become as smooth as shoreline pebbles . By charming the locals , even the suspicious ones , with dreams of designer golf courses and luxury-home developments , all financed by " visionary " debt , he brings a gold-fevered disorder to their world . Because Joe already enjoys the trust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Complications ensue . <P> Smiley , the Pulitzer prizewinning author of A Thousand Acres , knows something about land and the many ways it accrues value , sometimes just in the imagination . Her book is a wise comic tale about the ways in which money makes more substantial things  --  land , love , friendship  --  dematerialize . <P> " All that is solid melts into air " was how Karl Marx once described the modern world . DeLillo is tackling something akin to the same evanescence in his book . Like Ulysses , Cosmopolis is a road story told in the space of a single day . Eric Packer is a 28-year-old billionaire assets manager who spends an eventful day traversing Manhattan in his chauffeured , cork-lined white stretch limousine , with all its built-in financial-data panels flashing , for the purpose of getting a haircut . <P> Along the gridlocked way , while ducking in and out of his car , he runs across an antiglobalism demonstration that turns into a riot , a funeral parade for a Sufi rapper , a rave party and a deranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages to have sex three times , though never with his strangely aloof new wife , a sumptuously wealthy minor poet who keeps crossing his path . As for the haircut , I do n't want to spoil the suspense .
