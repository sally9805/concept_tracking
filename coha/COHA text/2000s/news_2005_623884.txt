<p> Mmm , mmm good : A towering tepee of what looked like doughnut holes greeted guests at the Williams-Sonoma flagship store on Union Square . <p> It was not , however , the latest taste treat from the gourmet and home emporium . <p> Rather , the 5-foot-tall croquembouche was the centerpiece for a fete honoring Chuck Williams , founder of Williams-Sonoma , on his 90th birthday . <p> A mayoral proclamation declared it Chuck Williams Day in San Francisco and a rousing gospel choir serenaded the birthday boy . <p> Among the group of gourmandos : Cecilia Chiang ; chef Traci Des Jardins ; Chronicle Executive Food and Wine Editor Michael Bauer and his partner , Michael Murphy ; cookbook author Flo Braker , author and chef Joyce Goldstein ; Design Within Reach founder Rob Forbes ; Wade Benson and James West ; Cathy and Michael Podell ; food journalist and author Tori Ritchie ; Mary Risley ; and Stephen Brady . <p> Caterer Paula LeDuc , a longtime fan and friend of the man who brought balsamic vinegar and fish poachers into average American homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root chip cones , panini , soup sips ) as well as the towering birthday pastry creation , drizzled with spun sugar and wrapped in a satin bow . <p> Presumably , Chuck already has a drawerful of fancy garlic presses and mandolin slicers . So the Williams-Sonoma employees ( from more than 250 stores nationwide ) decided on something more personal and artistic . Hand-decorated boxes brimmed with 258 handmade cards containing about 9,000 well-wishes . Some were adorned with artwork , others bore poems in Chuck 's honor . And some folks really dug through their archives : A few copies of the original catalogs from the early ' 70s brought a smile to the king of cookware . <p> Final call : Expanding the nation 's shopping ops , Bonhams &; Butterfields , the San Francisco auction house owned by Bonhams Auctioneers of London , just opened an expanded salesroom in New York . <p> Art &; Antiques magazine hosted an autumn preview soiree for some 350 swell shoppers and supporters in Bonhams ' new digs in the historic Fuller Building on Madison Avenue . <p> Wowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall sales : a Henry Moore sculpture ( estimate : $2 million ) ; the gown worn by Liz Taylor in the film " A Place in the Sun " ; a David Hockney print that should fetch at least $18 grand when it goes on sale Tuesday in San Francisco ; and a rare 15th century edition of the " Book of Hours , " which once belonged to American collector David McCandless McKell and was later " rediscovered " here at one of Bonhams ' monthly appraisal events and will be on view ( Nov. 11-13 ) in the San Francisco galleries . <p> Sold ! If you 're the second richest man in the United States , who you gon na call when you 're ready to sell some San Francisco property ? Barbara Callan , natch . <p> And that 's just what famed financier Warren Buffett did , cold-calling Callan with the listing for his two-condo building on Broadway near Steiner .

She 's also the No. 2 seller , overall , for the city 's residential market . <p> The combined listing price for Buffett 's condos ? $3.89 million . The solo buyer paid $570K over asking for both units . The grand total ? $4.46 million . And that 's with only one garage . <p> A tidy profit for the Oracle of Omaha ( whose Berkshire Hathaway fund currently retails around $85,000 per share ) who purchased the building in 1988 for a mere $705K . <p> Big screen : Barbara 's son , filmmaker and actor Geoff Callan , is off for a quick trip to Ireland where his documentary , " Pursuit of Equality , " screens at the Cork Film Festival . <p> The festival celebrates its 50th anniversary this year , and the city of Cork is enjoying its status as the European Union 's Capital of Culture darling . <p> " It 's amazing our film was chosen , " said Geoff , " because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With director Scott Derrickson 's " The Exorcism of Emily Rose " also on the docket , surely most of the citizens of Ireland are ready for a film about gay marriage . Besides family is family  --  the Callans hail from Cork . <p> Woman with gems : In homage to Paloma Picasso , in town to celebrate her 25th year designing jewelry for Tiffany &; Co. , Fleur de Lys chef-owner Hubert Keller whipped up a very special dessert : mousse in the shape of Paloma 's signature red lipstick tube . <p> Among the aficionados ( and good Tiffany customers who got first crack at Paloma 's new line ) at the private dinner : Paloma 's husband , Dr. Eric Thevenet ; Lucy and Fritz Jewett ; Dede Wilsey and John Traina ; Olga Dollar ; Wilkes Bashford ; Lisa Lenzo ; Cecilia and Wil Harris ; designer Steven Volpe ; Maria Manetti Farrow ; and members of the Tiffany contingent , including Susan Geary , Michael Barcun and Giles Marsden . <p> When asked what she was going to wear to the dinner , Paloma wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then she 'd decide on her outfit . <p> " Always , " said the daughter of iconic painter Pablo Picasso , " the jewelry first . " <p> Paloma chose a little something from her new anniversary line : a pearl necklace anchored by a 53-carat aquamarine semiprecious stone . A color better suited for those fairer in tone than the striking brunette . But Paloma said she enjoys the aquamarine 's cool , dreamy color as it " brings out the blonde sleeping inside of her . " <p> Baubles , bangles and beads : For once , there was a " guest gift " everyone wanted to take home at the dinner Trevor Traina hosted in his home for the Connoisseurs Circle of the San Francisco Fall Antiques Show preview party ( Oct. 26 at Fort Mason ) : Hermes jewelry . <p> Set against the white fabric of the Stanlee Gatti-designed banquettes , glittering gems and intricately designed gold pieces from Hermes ' new Au Fil de L'Or line hung from tiny , mirrored forms on each table . <p> " I know all of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not just to buy jewels ! " <p> Hermes was the sponsor for this savvy shopping set of the antiques show , of which Trevor and Allison Speer serve as Connoisseurs Circle co-chairs this year . <p> Among the guests at the intimate dinner , set in supper club-style splendor : Trevor 's parents , Dede and John ; Anthony Fuccillo , vice president of Hermes , U.S. ; former San Francisco Hermes manager Terry Howard who was helping host this final event before she retires and joins her husband full time on their Central Valley farm ; Sotheby 's Vice President Jennifer Biederbeck and her husband , Doug Biederbeck ; collectors Dorothy and Ken Paige ; Trevor 's gal pal Alexis Swanson ; Deborah Minor ; and Dr. Alan Malouf .

" But if they decide they want something , I 'm sending the bill here ! " <p> Turning to his wife , designer Patti Skouras , who created the chic , modernistic and retro-Deco look that defines Trevor 's home , Tommy encouraged her further : " Go ahead , darling  --  Trevor 's buying .
