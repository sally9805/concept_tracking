Of all the anguished New Yorkers who lost loved ones in the World Trade Center , Howard Lutnick was perhaps the hardest to watch on TV , especially for anyone who has ever known responsibility for a lot of people . Lutnick , 40 , is CEO of the bond-trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald , which appears to have lost as many as 700 of its 1,000 Trade Center employees , those who were at work last Tuesday between the 101st and 105th floors of the north tower  --  just 10 floors above where the hijacked jet plowed in and exploded at 8:48 a.m . <P> Lutnick would normally have been at his desk on the 105th floor at that hour . But on Tuesday he dropped off his five-year-old son for the first day of kindergarten  --  " big-boy school , " as Lutnick , in tears , described it last week on ABC News . He arrived at the Trade Center to see it in flames . <P> As the north tower 's workers began streaming out of stairwells and into the streets , Lutnick asked which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' 55 , ' " he recalled . The number kept rising , along with his hopes . What Lutnick did n't know was that the inferno below his employees had sealed off all avenues of escape . A group of them were gathered around a speakerphone talking to colleagues in the U.S. and overseas when the jet struck . Chaos erupted , and the line went dead . Other workers , including Lutnick 's younger brother Gary , phoned their families to tell them goodbye . <P> When the building began to collapse , Lutnick sprinted north to escape the avalanche of debris . When he finally emerged from the dust and smoke , he realized what the future would be like for him and his 320 surviving workers in the New York City area , plus 1,150 more worldwide . " We 've got to make our company be able to take care of my 700 families , " he said . <P> The community of traders in government bonds is a small one , and Cantor has long been its key player , facilitating deals between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one another . It is a high-pressure business , with inhuman hours and often with millions of dollars riding on a phone call . One source of Cantor 's success is its close-knit character . Many of the veteran brokers had worked together for years , and the intense atmosphere and enormous financial responsibility bred deep friendships . <P> Many families of the missing frantically hung leaflets , posted messages on the Internet and tried to contact other employees before , as the days went on , hope dissipated . Rachel Aron , a former Cantor employee who left two years ago , lost her stepfather as well as her husband , whom she had met at the firm . Their first anniversary would have been Sunday . Joseph Coppo , 19 , the namesake of his father , who perished with close friends and co-workers of 25 years , attended a gathering for Cantor families Thursday night at Manhattan 's Pierre Hotel . " I went down to talk to my dad 's colleagues , " he said , " and realized that none of them were there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is enormous , but they have already begun . The bond market reopened on Thursday , and two-year Treasury-bill interest rates dropped to their lowest historical levels as investors sought put their money in an old standby .
