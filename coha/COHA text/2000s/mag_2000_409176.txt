Does anyone want to try making a time-lapse digital movie of Ceres as it glides by a galaxy ? // THEY 'RE THE FORGOTTEN ONES . Circling the Sun in well-behaved orbits beyond Mars , asteroids of the " main belt " seldom garner headlines . They 've never had a role in a Hollywood movie ( unlike their Earth-approaching cousins ) , and they are little more than moving specks of light in any telescope . Unless they have a highly publicized rendezvous with a spacecraft or pass directly in front of a bright star , as described on page 100 last month , these minor members of the solar system are easy to overlook . That 's the embarrassing trap that an English astronomer , Thomas W. Backhouse , fell into long ago . In March 1887 he noticed an apparently new star , just visible to the naked eye , near 103 Piscium . The Dunecht Observatory in Scotland issued a circular about the object before anyone realized it was simply the minor planet Vesta , which had been discovered 80 years earlier . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asteroids can be spotted with no more optical paraphernalia than a pair of binoculars . Let the charts in this article be your guide . Vesta is due to become a marginal naked-eye sight again this summer , just as it has done on many occasions since Backhouse 's time . It is already brighter than magnitude 8.0 , but you need to get up before dawn and sweep for it with binoculars low in the southeastern sky . Vesta moves far eastward in February and March , covering nearly a half degree per day as it crosses the rich Milky Way north of the Sagittarius Teapot . On March 13th Vesta will pass extremely close to SAO 161803 , a 6th-magnitude star near the Teaspoon asterism . According to Belgian astronomer jean Meeus , shipboard observers in the Indian Ocean have a chance to see an occultation lasting up to 18 seconds at around 22:34 Universal Time . Unfortunately , Vesta is then below the horizon for observers in Europe and the Americas ; in Australia , daylight interferes . A good time for North American observers to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes just 6 ' north of R Sagittarii . This Mira-type variable , in the Teaspoon 's " handle , " is identified on our finder chart above . The ruddy tint of the star may contrast , or even clash , with the well-known pinkish hue of Vesta itself Vesta will then be magnitude 7.0 and R Sagittarii somewhat fainter . According to the latest predictions by the American Association of Variable Star Observers ( www. aavso.org ) , the variable wo n't reach its maximum , near magnitude 7.3 , until about May 15th . For a few nights in mid-July , around the date of its opposition to the Sun , Vesta becomes as bright as magnitude 5.4 . It 's a sure bet that Vesta could be glimpsed with the naked eye then , were it not for the overpowering glare from a nearly full Moon . Even so , Vesta might be spotted from Hawaii , Australia , and Japan on July 16th , when the Moon ( just 2 ' away ! ) will be much dimmed by that night 's total lunar eclipse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half later with the Moon long gone . Vesta is then quite near 52 and 51 Sagittarii , two stars of magnitude 4.6 and 5.6 that are 14 ' apart . The 5.7-magnitude Vesta joins this pair to form a close triple on the evenings of the 27th and 28th . The asteroid passes right between the two stars ( as Meeus points out ) for observers in the Middle East and Asia . As Vesta fades through mid-October , sinking progressively lower in the western evening sky , it is worth recalling that for most of the 19tb century astronomers considered Vesta to be the largest asteroid as well as the brightest . But when E. E. Barnard made a high-power visual examination with the Lick 36-inch refractor in 1895 , he was surprised to find that Vesta had a smaller angular size than either Ceres or Pallas . He concluded that Vesta has a more highly reflective surface than the other two , and modern studies bear him out. * Ceres hovers at 8th magnitude or a little brighter through the entire first half of the year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is making a graceful loop through the Virgo-Coma Berenices " realm of the galaxies . " Photograph Photograph Above : Early risers need only grab a pair of binoculars to locate Vesta in the southern sky . Identifying the little planet is a snap from now through October , for it is always at least three times brighter than the faintest stars ( magnitude 9.0 ) on this chart .

These events offer unique imaging opportunities , ranging from a long photographic exposure that makes the asteroid trail to a much briefer CCD image of a galaxy playing host to a brilliant " supernova . " ( How about a time-lapse digital movie of a galaxy with the asteroid gliding by ? ) Photograph The bright star Procyon and the Head of Hydra are this year 's guides to Pallas and Iris . When try- , ing to relate the star patterns you see to this chart , keep in mind that Hydra 's Head , from Zeta ( zeta ) to Sigma ( sigma ) , nearly fills the field of a typical pair of 7x50 binoculars . For Pallas 's long path , note that this chart is an extension of that on page 96 of last month 's issue . // Ceres will be magnitude 7.3 as it passes close to the edge-on barred spiral NGC 4746 on the evening of February 25th . Then on March 18th it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later past the even brighter M91 . Look for Ceres on April 11th near NGC 4237 , and then again on the 27th as it plows through the field of the galaxy cluster Abell 1474 . The asteroid will have faded to magnitude 8.5 by the time it grazes NGC 4365 , a big 10th-magnitude elliptical galaxy , on the evening of June 26th . Pallas , after being far south in Puppis during January and much of February , climbs rapidly north through Monoceros and then veers east past the Head of Hydra . Reaching peak brightness in early February at magnitude 7.4 , Pallas gradually fades in the coming months . By the end of May it will be much less obvious , hard to tell apart from the many 9thmagnitude stars on the chart above . iris is not normally considered a binocular target , for it ranks only 25th in size among the asteroids , according to the 4th edition of The New Solar System . But because this little planet passed perihelion ( the point in its orbit nearest the Sun ) last June 15th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At magnitude 8.1 around opposition in early February , Iris can be spotted only 2 1/2 deg south of the open cluster M67 in Cancer . By the evening of February 8th Iris will have moved to a point 16 deg due south of 5.7-magnitude 49 Cancri . But in midMarch this asteroid comes almost to a halt among the stars as Earth , in its own orbit , begins pulling away at the rate of 1.6 million kilometers ( 1 million miles ) each day . That brings rapid fading , to magnitude 9.7 by April 1st , so catch Iris while you can .
