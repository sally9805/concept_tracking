<p> Many survivors live in cramped trailers or tents , but they are <p> determined to stay and recover <p> D'IBERVILLE , Miss .  --  Hoby Swiney lives in a cramped , one-bedroom government trailer on what used to be a middle school football field . Hurricane Katrina destroyed his apartment and everything except the clothes he had on . <p> " It 's not comfortable , " says Swiney , 47 , of his place in a trailer park set up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency . " I appreciate it , because it 's better than what some have . But it 's just so little , and I am not a little bitty fellow . " <p> He knows it could be worse . One of his temporary neighbors , Nancy Hegland , lives in a trailer the same size with her son , 18 , and daughters , 17 and 3 . <p> " It is a little cramped , " says Hegland , 49 , a drugstore cashier . " But we 're just glad to have a roof over our head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sometimes seems like nobody 's home in coastal Mississippi . Almost 100,000 Mississippians are living in FEMA trailers . Hundreds of other residents are ineligible for such aid and have had to make other living arrangements while they try to repair their ruined homes . <p> Swiney and Hegland have it good compared with some of their Katrina-displaced neighbors . A few miles from their mobile home park , Stanley Strzelecki lived for weeks in a bare wooden hut that was part of a tent city for storm victims here . The compound of 50 tents built by the U.S. Navy Seabees was home to 106 people  --  including 26 children  --  who lived there while awaiting FEMA trailers . <p> Down Interstate 10 in Gulfport , Steve Bosarge is trying to decide whether he wants to keep the house he has owned for 11 years . Bosarge , 67 , has been living with a friend in Texas while he goes through the numbing grind of trying to find contractors . His family ties to Mississippi are strong and deep , so he probably will stay . But sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says he almost wishes Katrina had flattened it so he could walk away . <p> ' Our history is gone ' <p> It 's not just private residences , either . One of the state 's most-visited attractions , the 150-year-old Beauvoir House in Biloxi , which was the retirement home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis , was heavily damaged and is being repaired . Some other coastal landmarks , historic houses that had withstood the ravages of time and other hurricanes , were destroyed . <p> " Our history is gone . It 's just gone , " says Charles Sullivan , a historian at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College who has written extensively about the region . <p> Yet Mississippians mostly are picking up and pushing on . Some residents who rebuilt after losing everything to Hurricane Camille in 1969 have had enough and will move elsewhere . But there is far more defiance in coastal Mississippi than defeat . Many residents proudly display yard signs that say " We Are Staying . " <p> Similar resilience was evident after Camille , says Philip Hearn , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history Hurricane Camille : Monster Storm of the Gulf Coast . However , he says , the road back stretches long . " It 's going to take decades , " Hearn says . " The difference now is that the casinos are there , and they 're driving the recovery . They 're going to come back . The question is what is it going to look like . The face of the Mississippi Gulf Coast is changed forever . " <p> So are the lives of many who live there . <p> Rents skyrocket <p> Swiney retired early from the soft drink business . He was renting what he describes as a " comfortable " two-bedroom apartment for $350 a month . Now , he lives in a FEMA trailer that sometimes feels as tight as a turtle 's shell . <p> " I 'm looking right now , " he says . " I call people every day , to see if somebody 's got a used trailer or something . You ca n't find an apartment . Places that used to rent for $250-$300 a month are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price gouging . " <p> He wo n't guess how long it 'll take to get back to normal . " There 's nothing here no more , " he says . " It used to be there was always something to do . You could go fishing . You could go out to eat . It 's like the whole town died . " <p> Hegland , his neighbor , is trying just as diligently to find a bigger place . She was paying $650 a month rent before the hurricane but says it 's difficult to find a place she can afford . " Everything is just so high now , " she says . " I 've never seen prices like these . Even a four-bedroom , I 've never seen go over $800-$900 . I called this one place , and they wanted $2,000 for four bedrooms . " <p> She says she is saving every dime she can , hoping to snatch something if it becomes available , or to buy a place eventually . " Right now , though , to be honest with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months or so here , " she says . <p> A few miles from their mobile home park , Strzelecki lived in the tent city . This was one of three such sites  --  the others were in Pass Christian and Long Beach  --  that were used as temporary housing , manager Kelly Derouen says . The tent cities were taken down , and FEMA is setting up sites for longer-term housing . <p> Strzelecki , 26 , was renting a room from his parents , who had a mobile home in a low-lying area of Ocean Springs , he says . " A big boat hit our house , " he says . " It was named One Night Stand . After the hurricane , I got a FEMA trailer , but my parents were living in a shelter . My mom has heart problems , so I gave them my trailer , and I 'm waiting for another one now . " <p> Bosarge 's house in Gulfport sits two blocks from the Gulf of Mexico . He bought it 11 years ago and decorated it with paintings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still standing , although it is uninhabitable because of storm damage . His Chickering grand piano , which was built in the 1930s and last appraised for $15,000 , was heavily damaged . " We 'll see if it can be restored , " says Bosarge , a public relations and marketing consultant . " I 've got it insured as fine art . " <p> For Bosarge , a Mississippi native who was no stranger to hurricanes , his real worries began when he came back home after the hurricane . " That 's when all the frustrations really began , " he says . " Trying to get in touch with the insurance company . Trying to commute back and forth between here and ( Texas ) . Trying to find contractors . <p> ' People do come back ' <p> As Swiney , Hegland , Strzelecki , Bosarge and others adapt to their new homes away from home , it is difficult to predict what long-term demographic impact Katrina will have on the state 's population . <p> A Mississippi demographer , who cautions that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is optimistic . <p> " The little bit of research we have , based on Florida following up on their hurricanes , indicates that even though there 's lots of destruction and people have to rebuild , they find that people do come back , " says Barbara Logue , senior demographer at the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning . " People like to live in coastal areas . They 're not stupid . They know they could get hit by hurricanes . But they 'll take the trade-off because that 's where they want to live . " <p> Logue , whose employer oversees eight four-year colleges in the state , says a primary variable driving migration is the economy and jobs . " If there are jobs , and we 're going to have plenty of construction jobs , I think people will come back , and new people will move in , " Logue says . " The casinos are going to drive a lot of the economic rebuilding . " <p> Three of the Mississippi Gulf Coast 's 10 casinos reopened in January , and four others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi Gaming Commission . <p> Sullivan , the historian , says the Mississippi Gulf Coast is counting on gambling 's revival to help it rebound . " If the casinos do n't re-prime the pump , then the pump 's not going to get re-primed , " he says . " There is nothing else down here that could do it . "
