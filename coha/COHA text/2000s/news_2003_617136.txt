<p> ROCK REVIEW <p> " No Thanks ! : The ' 70s Punk Rebellion " <p> Various artists . Rhino Records . 100 tracks . <p> Grade : A <p> The punk explosion of the late ' 70s was a lot more stylistically diverse than one label can comfortably contain . The Ramones ' short , sharp blast of " Blitzkrieg Bop " and the seven-minute guitar workout of Television 's " Little Johnny Jewel " share only geography ( New York ) , chronology ( 1975-76 ) and singers with odd yet distinctive voices . But that 's part of what makes this set so entertaining . From the definitively punk " One Chord Wonders " by the Adverts to the punk-funk fusion of the Pop Group 's " She Is Beyond Good and Evil , " the best part of this almost perfect set is the neglected gems that might gain some new fans . The only caveat : Reportedly , crabby old Johnny Rotten ( aka John Lydon ) would n't allow the Sex Pistols to be included , though as the producers point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Never Mind the Bollocks " is an even more essential purchase than this . <p> - Shane Harrison <p> ROCK <p> * " Once in a Lifetime " <p> Talking Heads . Rhino Records . 55 tracks , plus a 13-track DVD . <p> Grade : A <p> A spectacular three-CD/one-DVD set that makes a strong case for Talking Heads as one of the best bands of the 1980s  --  and the ' 70s . In fact , as this set washes over you , the quintessentially unclassifiable band begins to seem like the critical bridge between the two decades . <p>  --  Nick Marino <p> * " The Essential Bruce Springsteen " <p> Bruce Springsteen . Columbia . 42 tracks . <p> Grade : A- <p> Not many folks make music that 's both danceable and important . Springsteen 's always known how to rocket you out of your chair and make you think about what he 's saying , long after the song 's over . <p> But if you 've been a fan since the early days , you probably have all the albums already  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So why bother with this ? As Mavis Staples would say , it takes you there . From boardwalk Sandy ( " 4th of July , Asbury Park " ) to slain Amadou Diallo ( " American Skin 41 Shots " ) , the wild and innocent people of Springsteen 's best musical close-ups ring as real and true and essential as ever . And lodging them side by side in a finely distilled collection ( with bonus rarities ) only enhances their power . <p>  --  Eileen M. Drennen <p> FOLK/ROCK <p> * " Must I Paint You a Picture ? : The Essential Billy Bragg " <p> Billy Bragg . Rhino Records . 50 tracks . <p> Grade : A <p> Politically scrappy Brit folk-rocker Bragg came along in the wake of punk , combining the genre 's do-it-yourself , lo-fi aesthetic with a smarter , wittier lyrical gift than most of that shout-along lot ( obvious Bragg precursors the Clash and the Jam among the few exceptions ) . It 's fascinating to hear his progress in this chronological set , an organizational device that more compilers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clang of " A New England " and " To Have and Have Not " to the studio-slick " Sexuality " and the Spectoresque wall of sound in the poppy " Cindy of a Thousand Lives " and back to the more basic " Mermaid Avenue " tracks with Wilco . For the faithful , there 's a bonus disc of rarities highlighted by a beautiful 1999 radio performance of Ronnie Lane 's underappreciated " Debris . " <p>  --  SH <p> POP <p> * " The Classic Singles " <p> Nat King Cole . Capitol . 101 tracks . <p> Grade : A <p> Unfairly , singer and pianist Nat " King " Cole only seems to get trotted out this time of year , thanks to his classic recording of " The Christmas Song . " As this marvelous four-CD set overseen by daughter Carole Cole illustrates , Cole was so much more than a holiday hit . Before his success as a ballad singer with orchestral arrangements penned for him by giants Nelson Riddle and Billy May , Cole was the humble leader of a hardworking piano-based jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career are represented in-depth on this remarkably well-remastered project . <p>  --  Richard L. Eldredge <p> AMERICANA <p> * " Cash Unearthed " <p> Johnny Cash . American/Lost Highway Records . 79 tracks . <p> Grade : A- <p> When Cash died Sept. 12 , he was an icon with few peers in American culture , equally comfortable with old-time gospel and dangerous punk , revered by everyone who mattered in music . But his stature had been carefully rebuilt over the past decade on four CDs with rock producer Rick Rubin that had reintroduced Cash as the ultimate elder statesman of Americana . " Cash Unearthed " feels like a tombstone : slablike , black and square . Many of the songs deal with death , as Cash inched toward his own . They are full of simply amazing music , wonderful and bizarre collaborations that ( mostly ) work , startling covers of songwriters from Jimmie Rodgers to Tom Waits . The first four discs are unreleased songs from the Rubin sessions , the fifth a " best of " selection from the four CDs . Disc four 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one long session , stands out : Cash , half-blind and in a wheelchair , literally leafed through his mother 's hymnal and sang . The grace is almost overwhelming . <p>  --  Phil Kloer <p> ROCK/POP <p> * " Films About Ghosts  --  The Best of Counting Crows " <p> Counting Crows . Geffen. 16 tracks . <p> Grade : B+ <p> There are just some bands that you can only listen to in small doses . Counting Crows falls into that category for me ( though there are plenty who will disagree ) . That makes this compilation the perfect distillation of their undeniably catchy and timelessly classic sound . Vocalist Adam Duritz 's Van Morrison-isms never have a chance to grow grating when the material maintains standards this high . While it already leans heavily on the group 's 1993 debut " August and Everything After , " which is certainly a good thing , the compilers should have found room for that album 's closer , " A Murder of One . " As usual , there are new songs to rope in the fans who already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * " The Singles 1992-2003 " <p> No Doubt . Interscope Records . 15 tracks . <p> Grade : B+ <p> Finally a look back at a career that feels like it 's been around long enough to legitimately do so . Though No Doubt only really came to people 's attention with 1995 's " Tragic Kingdom , " the ska-centered band got its start 17 years ago . The thing is , they play with the fervor of newcomers with less than 17 minutes to impress the record label . Cyndi Lauper may be most famous for declaring that girls just want to have fun , but this vividly illustrates that few girls sound like they 're having as much fun as lead singer Gwen Stefani  --  even when she 's slyly belittling herself ( " Just a Girl " ) , questioning herself ( a new cover of Talk Talk 's " It 's My Life " ) or just allowing herself to be crazy in love ( " Hella Good " ) . <p>  --  Sonia Murray <p> R &B; <p> * " Ultimate " <p> Toni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Judging by the relatively poor sales of Toni Braxton 's most recent CD , the career of the smoky crooner who was introduced on the soundtrack for " Boomerang " seems to have done exactly that . And here you do n't hear one compelling reason why . From the jingly chirp of her 1992 single " Give U My Heart " to the absolutely lovely " Let It Flow " to the last song we heard from her  --  now how 's this for irony  --  " Hit the Freeway , " the part-time Sandy Springs resident has come up with the best Braxton CD of her five . <p>  --  SM <p> COUNTRY <p> * " The Legacy : 1961  --  2002 " <p> Glen Campbell . Capitol . 80 tracks <p> Grade : B+ <p> With his sculpted hair and ready-to-pinch cheeks , Glen Campbell was America 's smiley face in 1969  --  a safe musical alternative to Woodstock 's counterculture . As a result , his stunning body of work has often been dismissed as dumbed-down propaganda , rarely heard on radio or revived for soundtracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show an artist who was a perfectly understated interpreter of songs and a brilliant guitarist . From the career-making " Gentle on My Mind " through Jimmy Webb tunes such as " Wichita Lineman " and " Galveston " ( the original emo music ) , Campbell echoes the pulse that was beating in America 's suburbs during a time of political confusion , war and changing values . His early work ( " Turn Around , Look at Me " ) reveals an intriguing transformation from country singer to mainstream artist . The duets here with Mississippi mama Bobbie Gentry ( " Scarborough Fair/Canticle " ) reflect the anything-goes campiness of 1960s variety TV . A fun romp through the Nixon-era jukebox . <p>  --  Miriam Pace Longino <p> ROCK <p> * " Lost Dogs " <p> Pearl Jam . Epic Records . 30 tracks . <p> Grade : B <p> Along with two non-album tracks ( " Yellow Ledbetter " and " Last Kiss " ) that became surprise hits , this spotty but worthwhile rarities set features such delightful oddities as " Gremmie Out of Control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also comes with handy liner notes that offer track-by-track commentary by the band members , who reveal , among other tasty info nuggets , that bassist Jeff Ament almost quit the band when guitarist Stone Gossard decided he did n't want to play " Brother " anymore . <p>  --  NM <p> RAP <p> * " Greatest Hits " <p> Wyclef Jean . Sony Urban Music/Columbia. 13 tracks . <p> Grade : B <p> Before you hear one note , there 's already a problem with a Wyclef Jean greatest hits CD : His greatest , or at least most memorable , hits are on other people 's records . The Fugees , Santana , Whitney Houston  --  take your pick . Plus with a mere four solo albums to his credit , this ca n't help but seem premature . ( The background : He left the label he recorded his first three with , the label that is behind this compilation . ) All that said , this is still a fine sample of the outstanding producer , limber rapper and reggae-gruff singer 's abilities ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " We Trying to Stay Alive " that all those talents shine through . <p>  --  SM <p> ROCK <p> * " Greatest Hits " <p> Red Hot Chili Peppers . Warner Bros. 16 tracks . <p> Grade : B- <p> The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of those groups who make you feel like you , too , can be a multimillion-selling rock act . Lead singer Anthony Kiedis ' voice is in no way accomplished . It 's more about enunciation and bravado than power or beauty . Little to nothing here lyrically would strike you as clever or smart on paper . Hooks and melody made mega-singles " Give It Away " and " Under the Bridge . " But what distinguishes this incredibly musical California foursome  --  and has kept them around for two decades  --  is that they do n't just rock ; they 're Red Hot at blues , of sorts ( " Scar Tissue " ) , funk ( " Suck My Kiss " ) and even a cowboy-country/soft-folk blend ( " My Friends " ) . <p>  --  SM
