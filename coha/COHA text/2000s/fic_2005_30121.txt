Nail Biter By Sarah Graves Bantam Sarah Graves Cursing the wild raspberry brambles that snatched at his hands and the cold mist drifting in off the salt water a hundred yards distant , Eugene Dibble made his way clumsily through the overgrown brush and weeds behind the old McSorley place on Long Cove Road . It was already midmorning , much later than he 'd expected to be hanging around here . But he 'd had to wait until the tenants went out . Short-term tenants , only visiting for a few weeks according to what he 'd heard . So would n't you think they 'd have better things to do than sit around inside all day , delaying his plans ? But finally their white van had backed from the driveway and pulled off down Long Cove Road . About time , he grumbled inwardly . Stupid tourists going on another one of their stupid outings , he thought , plucking a thorn from the skin of his left hand as he pushed forward . Cursing , he stumbled on an old broken-out section of picket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he licked fresh blood from his wounded finger , he tried shaking the fence piece off his boot while eyeing the house again . It was a small , cheaply built bungalow overlooking Long Cove , on Moose Island seven miles off the coast of downeast Maine . With faded red paint , sagging gray shutters each with the shape of an anchor cut into it , and a tumbledown attached utility shed at the rear , the house was one of dozens of suchdwellings hurriedly put up by the Navy for its station here during World War II . Yanking his boot from between a pair of rotting fence pickets , Eugene found himself remembering back when he was a kid , visiting the house for Cub Scout meetings . The fence had stood tall and proud then , painted white every year by Mr. McSorley , a retired Navy man himself . Eugene wondered idly whether horse-faced old Mrs. McSorley ever figured out which Scout was pilfering her purse while he was supposed to be busy earning yet another of her half-assed merit badges . Then the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Cubs flooded back , the noise and little-boy smells . One week the meeting might be about butterfly collecting ; this he had enjoyed because he liked sticking pins into the insects even though they were already dead , courtesy of a homemade gas chamber devised from a canning jar and a clump of alcohol-soaked cotton . But the next week the troop 's agenda might involve learning to make butter by shaking jars half filled with cream ( and only recently emptied of butterflies , he 'd suspected ) until the boys ' arms nearly fell off . Eugene scowled as he recalled the yellow clots taking shape in the cream , which he 'd tried to drink afterwards only to find it had turned to buttermilk . Stupid woman , he remembered thinking at the time ; why was n't there a merit badge for something useful like making beer ? The memory fled as another wave of his current mood , which was anxious resentment , washed over him again . The tenants were gone , off to experience the delights of this remote and undeniably scenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sitting there waiting for him -- was a good thing . Still , nobody ever took him on an outing , did they ? That was for sure . Instead he was out here risking life and limb in this decaying backyard jungle , the very sight of which would 've given Mr. McSorley a heart attack even worse than the one that finally did carry him off . And all for a paper bag that might or might not contain what Eugene had been promised that it would . No , he corrected himself as another bramble snagged his pants leg . Not just promised : guaranteed . And if by some chance that guarantee did n't pan out in spades , Eugene thought as he kicked fiercely at the offending vegetation , it would n't be his neck that got broken . That was for sure , too . His foot caught again , this time in a loop of bittersweet vine tough as rope , sending him flailing until he came down hard on his left ankle , twisting it painfully . He bit back a yelp . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west end of the island were too far apart and the intervening weeds and scrubby saplings too thick and tall , up over his head . But it would n't do to have anyone hear him , would it ? Some nosy idiot whose presence absolutely had n't been planned on , who might hear him cussing and wonder what the dickens he might be up to , stumbling around out here in the brush and trash . And remember it later maybe , too . No , Eugene definitely did n't want any of that . Wincing , he hobbled the last few yards to the edge of the thicket and peered again at the rear of the house . No one in there . The whole plan depended on it . And on me , Eugene reminded himself with a fresh surge of annoyance as he scooted from the cover of brush to the broken back door . Never mind that there 's two in this plan , he thought darkly as he tried the old door . Two splitting the profit . But only one taking any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he thought irritably . If there might be a dirty end to the stick , just call Eugene . He 's dumb enough to grab it . Which had happened before , and was pretty much what he was doing this time , too , while his partner sat safely in the car up on the road , on the other side of the back lot . So much for fairness . So much for sharing the work equally . But this time at least there was guaranteed to be a fine payoff . One hard yank and the door to the falling-down little shed popped open . He glanced around furtively , then ducked inside and pulled it solidly closed behind him again . And paused . No sound from within the house . He could hear his heart pounding but his breath came easier , though his ankle now felt like the fires of hell had been ignited inside his boot . Reassured by the silence , he examined his surroundings . An old washing machine , some broken flower pots , cans of used motor oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Man , and people said his place was a dump . Which it was , but at least he had an excuse . When you never got a break , just more struggles and disappointment , when the others got moonlight and roses and all you ever got was a kick in the face , then maybe you just did n't have the resources to keep everything all spiffed up and la-di-dah all the damned time . He looked around some more , conscious that even with no one in the house he had better hurry . The bag should be right here somewhere . An ordinary brown paper bag , folded over and stapled at the top . A bag with a couple of hundred illegal pills in it . Eugene felt his heart lift buoyantly just at the thought . Two hundred pills , twenty or even thirty bucks ' profit on each : best case , and if his arithmetic was right , the score added up to a whopping six thousand dollars . Divided by two . . . Which Eugene grudgingly admitted to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills and he was not in a position to do it , especially not now with a bum ankle . It was still a good payday for a relatively simple outlay of work , he told himself , even if he did have to split the cash . So all right , then , where the hell was the damned bag ? With a scowl of distaste -- for in his heart and despite the disorder of his own personal living situation , Eugene Dibble felt himself to be a fastidious man -- he began picking through the many items left here to decay by some long-ago occupant . The shed 's old double-hung windows , gone awry in their weather-beaten wooden frames , shivered in the wind as he searched , his hands stinging and blood-streaked from thorn scratches and his boots sliding on the mossy , uneven red bricks that formed the floor of the rickety structure . Under old magazines : no . Behind a laundry hamper half buried in a pile of yellowed venetian blinds that clattered and fell as he touched them : nada . Under a heap of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right out in plain sight , but of course that was too much to hope for . That would be way more luck than Eugene Dibble , at the relatively young age of forty-six a seasoned expert in the many varieties of ill fortune , had any right to expect . Or so he griped to himself as he went on searching , now beginning to feel real worry along with the flares of anguish from his ankle each time his weight came down on his left foot . Had something gone wrong ? Even after all the assurances he 'd been given , could the bag possibly not be here ? Then he froze , one hand on the top drawer of an ancient , veneer-peeling bureau with a broken mirror and the other on the lid of an old toolbox . A sound , somewhere in the house . . . Guilt overlaid by a spine-tingling thrill of superstitious fear overcame him as he stood very still , listening for the sound to come again . Because the tenants were rumored to be . . . Witches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A coven , Eugene had been told that it was called , and once he 'd heard this rumor he 'd done as much to spread it as anyone . Not that he believed it . He 'd never even seen them . But he figured the tale would help keep anyone else from burglarizing the place before he did , someone who might accidentally find the bag before he got to it . Although finding it at all was turning out to be more of a chore than Eugene had expected . Just my luck . . . When after a few more moments nothing else happened , though , he relaxed , even laughed a bit at himself . Some burglar he was ; one funny noise and here he was getting all spleeny about it . Spleeny ; now there was a word he had n't thought of in a long time . What his mother , a downeast Maine girl born and bred , used to say when she meant anxious , unreasonably nervous . Still , he 'd been in here too long . Irked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to his search . Witches , that was a hot one , he thought as he poked beneath some old seat cushions . Four grown-ups and a kid from down south in Massachusetts , he 'd heard ; from the practical standpoint they could n't have picked a worse time to occupy the old place . Which was n't surprising . It was how his luck always went . He unrolled a dusty rug ; nothing in it . On the other hand , having the whole town all excited about a witches ' group kept people from paying attention to any of Eugene 's activities , did n't it ? Which did work out just fine . So like most things in his life , it was a trade-off . Damn , where was the bag ? Just then the sound came again , louder . Footsteps . Soft but purposeful , coming steadily toward him . Panicky , Eugene looked out through a shed window and spotted the crown of a dark blue baseball cap peeping through the weeds out back . Wondering what could be keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car , which they had both agreed that his partner would not do , would not have any reason to do . And furthermore would not have time to do , because this was going to be such a piece of cake . Uh-huh , and look how well that worked out , Eugene thought , readying himself for a hasty exit . So now his partner had come anyway . Gotten out of the car , pushed his way through the thorns and bittersweet , and hunkered down in the weeds at the back of the yard with his hands shading his eyes , probably , so he could try to see what was up . Yeah , well , a complication was up , Eugene thought savagely , heading for the door . But when he grabbed at it the knob stuck and it was too late now . The footsteps were nearly in the shed . And then they were in the shed . Feet clad in a pair of new , obviously pricey white sneakers appeared in the doorway . Eugene stared at the expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then let his gaze move upward to the things this utterly unexpected person held in each hand . This person who was not supposed to be here , but was . In one hand : a paper bag , folded and stapled at the top . Eugene licked his lips as he caught sight of it . There , only a few tantalizing inches away from him , was his six thousand dollars . Then very reluctantly he turned his attention to what his surprising visitor held in the other hand . Oh , in the other hand . Staring , Eugene thought about bad luck , reflecting that in spite of all his earlier mental whining he 'd never really had any such thing , never in his whole life . But now . . . In the other hand was a gun . Aimed at him . Again he considered running . But the shed door was jammed , so to do it he 'd have had to get closer to the gun . Nope . Better try to talk his way out of this . Eugene opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hear it through the sudden , impossibly loud explosion happening inside his head . Abruptly he was looking up at the ceiling . Hell , he thought . Here a gun was aimed right at him and he could n't even summon the breath to say anything about it . Those mossy bricks were cold and uncomfortable on his back , too , and the window had become drafty all of a sudden . On the other hand , his ankle did n't hurt anymore . Which was exactly the kind of dumb thought that hit you , Eugene Dibble realized with a stab of regret , when you were about to die . Plus a whole laundry list of irrelevant stuff like how amazingly much of the world there was , and how very little you had managed to experience of it in what had turned out to be your too-short life . And how big the sky was , the sky outside if you 'd only managed to make it there , and how high and bright the moon would be tonight if only you were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him suddenly . For the pocketbook pilfering . For all of it . " This what you were looking for , Eugene ? " The paper bag , held up right over him , inches from his face . But it was n't important . Not anymore . A couple of the old windows reached all the way down to floor level . Eugene turned his head to somehow signal his partner in the weeds at the back of the yard . From the Hardcover edition .
