AFTER YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY , ASTRONOMERS THINK they are finally closing in on the true nature of gammaray bursts . These mysterious flares of high-energy radiation are detected about once a day from extremely distant galaxies near the limit of the observable universe . They appear to be the most powerful explosions since the Big Bang , yet they are extremely brief , lasting from a fraction of a second to a few minutes , a clear sign that they erupt from a tiny volume of space . But what are they ? Many of the world 's astronomers working on this problem gathered for the Fifth Huntsville Gamma-Ray Burst Symposium last October in Huntsville , Alabama . The talk of the meeting was the newly announced , tentative link between some gamma-ray bursts and evidence of supernova explosions . A team led by Joshua Bloom ( Caltech ) described finding evidence of a fading supernova in the weak , visible-light afterglow of the powerful burst that occurred on January 23 , 1999 ( S &T.; May 1999 , page 54 ) . When the afterglow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first as sumed was the underlying host galaxy . But Bloom and his colleagues kept watching - and found that in subse quent weeks and months the remaining bit of light also faded , supernova style . Soon other groups found similar evidence of fading supernovae following other bursts . // Left . Freeze-frame from a " hypernova " model of gamma-ray bursts . The entire frame is deep inside the core of a massive star , the view is hardly wider than the Earth . The star 's core is collapsing to a black hole at the center by way of a horizontal accretion disk ( unseen ) . From the vicinity of the hole shoot jets , about 10 deg wide , that will punch out of the star and blow it apart . The jets began 0.8 second ago and already carry more energy than the Sun will emit in its lifetime.They will reach 0.99995 the speed of light and emit a gamma-ray burst when they plow into the interstellar medium . The wider red plumes are gas that previously boiled off the face of the accretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140 million light-years away , was like none other . It apparently produced a gamma-ray burst as well as intense radio emission and ejecta flying out at more than 90 percent of the speed of light . Although its gamma-ray emission was relatively weak , it may be the missing link between supernovae and more distant powerful bursts . // Stan Woosley and Andrew MacFadyen ( University of California , Santa Cruz ) described their scenario , in which the bursts are caused by the supernova-like implosion of a very massive , rapidly rotating stellar core , which forms a black hole . The gamma radiation emerges in two beams aligned with the collapsing star 's rotational poles ; if one of the beams is aimed our way , we see a burst . Most of the gamma-ray-burst community has latched on to this " collapsar " or " hypernova " model as the best explanation of so-called long bursts , those lasting more than about five seconds . Short bursts may be something entirely different . Observations by NASA 's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory clearly show that long and short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far , all follow-up observations of burst afterglows at X-ray , optical , and radio wavelengths have been limited to long bursts . " It just so happens that until now there have been no short bursts in the view of the wide-field X-ray cameras of BeppoSAX , " says Luigi Piro , mission scientist for the BeppoSAX satellite . Its X-ray cameras have been essential for pinpointing burst locations accurately enough to find afterglows . That could change around the time you read this . NASA 's High Energy Transient Explorer 2 ( HETE-2 ) , scheduled to be launched on January 24th , should provide ground-based astronomers with about one accurate burst position per week , compared to BeppoSAX 's rate of roughly one a month . And HETE-2 should pinpoint the position just seconds after a burst begins rather than hours later , which is the best that astronomers have usually been able to do up to now . Many surprises may be in store . " Completely different burst mechanisms might be at work " for long and short bursts , says Shrivinas Kulkarni ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( University of California , Los Angeles ) suggest that the ultrashort bursts , those lasting less than 0 . 1 second , may not be distributed evenly across the sky , hinting that they have a relatively local origin in our Milky Way galaxy . Many of the conference 's attendees were skeptical of this announcement due to the small sample available so far . New mysteries may replace old ones . John Heise ( Space Research Organization Netherlands ) reported BeppoSAX 's discovery of what he calls X-ray flashes . These are similar to the X-ray outbursts that accompany gamma-ray bursts , except that no gamma rays are seen . Searches for their afterglows should reveal whether they are related to gamma-ray bursts or come from a new class of objects . The future for gamma-ray burst research looks bright - and not just because of HETE 2 . Last October NASA chose the Swift gamma-ray burst observatory as one of its new Medium Explorer missions . To be launched in 2003 , Swift will carry a gamma-ray detector , an X-ray telescope , and an optical and ultraviolet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's location within seconds and immediately train its instruments on the site while alerting ground-based observers . According to principal investigator Neil Gehrels ( Goddard Space Flight Center ) , Swift should catch about 300 burst afterglows per year . Brown Dwarf or Loose Planet ? Is it a tiny brown dwarf or a massive free-floating planet ? Maria R. Zapatero Osorio ( Astrophysics Institute of the Canaries , Spain ) and her colleagues are n't sure . But they have concluded that 5 Ori 47 , an extremely faint light source in Orion , has only 1 1/2 percent of our Sun 's mass , or the equivalent of 15 Jupiters . This means that S Ori 47s core may be too cool to sustain even a temporary phase of deuterium  --  consuming nuclear fusion . Zapatero Osorio and her colleagues scrutinized the super-dim source with a 1.5-meter reflector on the island of Tenerife . As detailed in an upcoming Astrophysical Journal Letters report , S Ori 47 belongs to the recently designated spectral class L ( S &T.; November 1998 , page 26 ) , and its atmosphere contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substellar objects . A Distance for Ever Gamma-Rav Burst ? Of the more than 2,500 gamma-ray bursts on record , accurate distances have been found for only a half dozen thanks to redshift measurements following the discoveries of just a few optical afterglows and host galaxies . Not knowing the distances to most bursts means not knowing their actual energies or much of anything else about them . However , Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and Ed Fenimore ( Los Alamos National Laboratory ) claim to have found a way to estimate the distance to any burst . For the six with known distances ( and hence luminosities ) , they found a striking correlation between peak luminosity and the flickering of the gamma-ray output during the explosion.The more powerful a burst , the stronger the flickering . If this correlation holds up , energy and distance estimates will become easy . " It 's an amazing find , " says Don Lamb of the University of Chicago . " if distances are known , gamma-ray bursts could be used as sensitive and powerful cosmological probes of the distant and very early universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see anything that happened at extremely high redshifts ( from z = 5 to , eventually , possibly as high as 20 ) . This range should span the era when the very earliest stars and galaxies started forming in the first billion years after the Big Bang . Seeing so far back should also clarify the overall geometry of the expanding universe . Similarly , Jay Norris ( NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center ) later announced finding a second telltale correlation : that between a burst 's luminosity and the time interval separating the peaks of its highest- and lowest-energy gamma-ray emissions.This method too holds the possibility of yielding the luminosities and distances of thousands of bursts out to extreme redshifts . <p>
