Whether she 's being teased or has lost a game , you can teach her to survive life 's little bumps // Losing hurts-especially when it 's your first time . I 'll never forget the stunned expression on my daughter 's little face the first time she competed and did n't win . Allison , then 4 , came in fifth out of 15 kids in a gymnastics exhibition . To me , that was pretty good . But to a child who was used to winning everything-or at least getting consolation prizes when she didn't-it was a major disaster . And when another girl received a big trophy , Allison started crying and was n't able to stop . As she wailed and I tried to comfort her , I wondered how best to handle this crisis . As usual , I had n't given the issue a moment 's thought until I came face to tear-stained face with it . What could I say that would soothe her and help her learn to cope with such difficult situations in the future ? A couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me some time to think things through . The fact is , a child 's life is filled with small crises , whether it 's failing to execute a trophy-winning somersault or not being invited to a birthday party . " Before age three or so , kids do n't care that much about losing , they do n't really seem to get embarrassed , and they 're oblivious to being snubbed , " says Wade Horn , Ph.D. , a child psychologist in Gaithersburg , Maryland , and an assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . " Then they start to become aware of how they relate to the rest of the world , and the fact that the world can sometimes be cruel . That 's why learning to face adversity without falling apart is essential-for now and the future . " If you rush in to solve the situation for your child , the lesson is lost . He needs to see that he can survive life 's little bumps and hurdles . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capable coper while he 's still young and the stakes are low . Here are some of the most common crises young kids face and how to teach the coping skills they 'll need : She tries hard but loses big Whether coming up short in a race or a game of checkers , kids can feel the agony of defeat with surprising intensity . But do n't label your child a poor sport-she does n't know any other way to be . Look at this as an opportunity to show her how to deal with her emotions so losing is less devastating later on . Crisis management : It turns out my Oreo-diversion method was n't totally off . But instead of cookies , try calming or diverting with some hugs and a quiet cooldown period , if circumstances allow . " When your child 's having a meltdown , words of wisdom are wasted , " says Debbie Webb Blackburn , Ph.D. , a clinical child psychologist in Richmond , Virginia , and a mother of three . Save the conversation for a mellower time , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledging her feelings with a statement like " It must have been really disappointing not to win . " Then let her know you expect her to try to handle it differently next time : " It 's okay to be sad about losing . But it 's not okay to yell or hit someone or turn over the playing board . " The proof that you 've dealt with the crisis correctly : Your child still does n't like to lose but is willing to take the chance and play again . He 's blown off by his buddies You may tell your kid that life is n't a popularity contest . But to him , it can certainly feel that way . Starting in kindergarten , children become much more selective in choosing their friends . That 's good , but it also means some are going to get hurt . And when your child is snubbed , it can bring up old feelings of rejection for you too . That 's how Russell Wild of Allentown , Pennsylvania , felt when his son had a social crisis last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new playhouse , and he was excited to show it off to his friends . " I extracted a blood oath from the moms of two of his friends that they 'd stop by after camp that day , " says Wild . " But neither showed up , and Clay was crushed . He cried all evening , and I felt like I was reliving part of my own childhood . I also wanted to kill the other parents . " Crisis management : Wild kept his cool-at least in front of Clay-and did n't vent his own disappointment . " If you 're responding from your own hurt feelings , it 's hard to be helpful , " says Judith Wagner , Ph.D. , director of the Broadoaks Children 's School at Whittier College , in California . " And if your child picks up on them , it may make him feel even worse about the whole thing . " It may help for you to haul out a humiliating story from your own past ( being stood up for the prom might finally come in handy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by explaining how you got over it . Your best bet : Try to focus on helping your child find his own way to cope . " Say , " I know you 're upset because your friends did n't come over . What are you going to do to make yourself feel better ? ' ' " advises Wagner . " This gives your child the opportunity to see himself as someone who can survive a difficult social situation . You may be surprised to find out that he has more inner resources than you think . " She 's caught misbehaving Trudi , 7 , usually loved school . So when she came home complaining that she hated her teacher and wanted to change classes , her mom , Hilde Ernsberger of Santa Clarita , California , knew something was up . " Tearfully , the story came out that Trudi had been caught not listening in class and had her name added to the list of troublemakers on the blackboard , " says Ernsberger . " She was mortified . " Crisis management : Because young kids still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher now thought she was " bad " and therefore hated her . Luckily , Ernsberger-a teacher herself-knew this , plus Trudi felt lousy enough and did n't need to be pressed on why she had n't been listening . Instead , she tried to give her some perspective . " I told her that everyone makes mistakes in life and that she would probably make some more before she finished school , " says Ernsberger . " I wanted to show her that we 're all human beings and she has to get used to her own human fallibility . " By the next day , Trudi loved her teacher again . He 's teased by the other kids Being mocked about something is inevitable for most children , as young kids still have a long way to go toward developing empathy . Of course , knowing that does n't necessarily make it any less heartbreaking when your child is the target . Last year Debbie Blackburn 's 6-year-old son , Zachary , who has a mild speech impediment , started a new school where the other kids were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he dressed up as Davy Crockett for Halloween and could n't pronounce it properly , " says Blackburn . " I felt so bad for him . " Crisis management : Blackburn admits that her first inclination was to throw her professional skills to the wind and yell at the kids for their insensitivity . " It was hard not to do it for him , but I stopped myself . I knew he 'd get more out of it if he talked to the kids himself . Zachary spoke with a few of the kids directly , which did n't stop all of the teasing . Eventually , the whole thing blew over . But the fact that he had spoken up did make him feel like less of a victim . " When possible , it can be helpful to anticipate the teasing and give your child ammunition to prepare for it . When Maureen Callahan 's daughter , Rachel , 6 , got glasses recently , she was thrilled . " Rachel thought she looked fabulous , " says Callahan , of Carmel , Indiana . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kids , which is the kind of thing that could cause problems . " So before Rachel wore her glasses to school for the first time , Callahan warned her that she could get picked on ; they brainstormed and came up with a few snappy retorts to common insults . When someone tried to rename Rachel " Four Eyes , " she was ready . She pulled off her glasses and said , " These are glasses , not eyes , and you need glasses if you ca n't see that ! " The teasing ceased . More important , says Callahan , " Rachel learned that she does n't have to crumple to the ground when someone makes fun of her . " She learns that life can be cruel I 'll never forget the time that Allison insisted on taking her favorite Beanie Baby , Sly the Fox , to the supermarket with us . I warned her ( wise mom that I am ) that it could get lost-and guess what happened ? We spent an hour looking for it in vain . When she burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ) not to worry , that I 'd get her another one . We drove from toy store to toy store searching for another Sly , only to come up empty-handed . In the end , I reluctantly sprang for a stuffed fox four times bigger than the original in order to comfort her . Crisis management : Okay , we all know that my approach was best for neither my child 's psyche nor my pocketbook . Basically , if you 're always rushing in to save your kids , you communicate that they 're fragile and can't-and do n't have to-cope with a difficult situation themselves . The best strategy : Commiserate about how awful it must feel to lose the toy , break the Game Boy , spill grape juice on the book . Then ask , " What would you do differently next time ? " That lets your child take responsibility for the problem and the solution ; it teaches the right lesson ; and it may save you a few future crises-not to mention spare you some extra trips to the toy store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly about parenting and relationships for Reader 's Digest , Self , and Glamour . // <p>
