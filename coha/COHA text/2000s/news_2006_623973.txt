<p> Q : I have an idea for two calendars , a fun-sexy one and a gritty military one . I realize that the world probably has enough calendars , but my concepts are unique . I 'd like to find the publishers of such calendars to determine demographics , market size , cost to produce , how much risk that I would take as opposed to them , and so on .  --  Pondering the Possibilities in Petaluma <p> A:I confess that I 've had my own ideas for calendars over the years , such as a Celebrity Refrigerator Calendar that would showcase the partly eaten pastrami sandwiches and moldy month-old yogurt containers of people like Brad Pitt and Paris Hilton . <p> But it 's a very crowded market out there in the calendar world , with thousands of titles jockeying for space in bookstores and gift shops . One Bay Area company called BrownTrout alone produces 900 different calendars . ( It has a calendar for just about every breed of dog in existence and nine different calendars with pictures of West Highland White Terriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were still getting their calendars from their insurance agent or dry cleaner , " said Tom Burke , founder and president of Pomegranate Communications , a Petaluma firm that produces about 170 different calendars including Sierra Club calendars and ones featuring artists like Georgia O'Keeffe and M.C. Escher . " This product did n't exist back then . Now it 's gigantic . " <p> Some calendar publishers like Pomegranate allow people to submit ideas , and even have sections on their Web sites for submissions . To find names of calendar publishers , just browse through the selection at your local bookstore or stationery store . ( Do it soon , before they 're all packed away and replaced with Valentine cards . ) <p> If by chance a publisher likes your idea , the arrangement would probably work like a book publishing deal . The company would assume all the risk and handle the production , and you would get a tiny amount of royalties . <p> But frankly , getting a publisher to adopt your idea is a long shot . <p> " If this is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one is going to be interested , " Burke said . " There are too many calendars chasing too little retail space . There 's going to be fallout in the industry . " <p> The other alternative is publishing these calendars yourself . This is a viable path if you want to print a limited number of calendars  --  as a promotional gift for customers , for instance , or a fundraising item for a nonprofit group . ( Remember the movie " Calendar Girls , " where some middle-aged British housewives created a nude calendar of themselves to raise money for a local hospital ? ) <p> But do n't count on being able to get wide distribution for a self-published calendar . Commercial publishers already have their 2007 calendars in production , and are meeting with buyers from the major chains about next year 's line-up , even though it 's just January . <p> " Will professional sales reps take the time to represent a guy with three calendars ? Probably not , " Burke said . " Will Barnes &; Noble give him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a small wine-import and wholesale business and am having problems finding reasonable insurance . The only quote I was able to get was $2,500 a month to cover liability for a 1,700-square-foot warehouse with protection for $50,000 worth of product inside . It 's just too high . I was told this was because I have no experience in the field . Any suggestions ?  --  Eager Enophile <p> A:It can be challenging to find insurance for an import business , according to Scott Hauge , owner of CAL Insurance in San Francisco . That 's because of the risk of liability . If someone is injured by a defective product ( food poisoning from bad wine ? a hyperactive champagne cork that puts out someone 's eye ? ) , it 's easier for them to sue the U.S. importer rather than the overseas manufacturer . <p> However , Hauge did a quick check and found three insurance carriers who would be willing to cover your kind of business for about $2,500 to $3,000 per year  --  Golden Eagle , Hartford and Safeco . <p> That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your insurance broker to make sure you heard the quote correctly . If he or she ca n't find you a more reasonable price , try another broker . And make sure it is a broker with experience providing commercial insurance , not just personal home or auto insurance .

For six years , I held the company as a sole proprietorship and my partner was an employee . Two years ago , when we were grossing about $250,000 , my accountant suggested we switch to a C corporation . We are now grossing between $150,000 and $200,000 , and the C corporation structure seems too big for us . Some people have said that we should have incorporated as a limited liability company . How do we go about making that change , and do you think it is the best choice for us ? If we get married in the future , would we be better off as a sole proprietorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a good idea to return to being a sole proprietor , regardless of whether you 're married or single . That 's because of the risk of liability . As a sole proprietor , you would be personally liable for the debts of your business . If the business got into financial trouble , creditors might be able to go after your home or other personal assets . <p> Your C corporation structure protects your personal assets from liability . But so would a limited liability company or a third alternative , an S corporation . And either an LLC or an S corporation may be more appropriate for a small business of your size . <p> Talk to your attorney and accountant about whether an LLC or an S corporation would be the best fit for your company . Some things to consider :  --  State taxes . Both an LLC and an S corporation are pass-through entities for federal taxes , meaning that there is no corporate tax on the federal level . The profits pass through to the owners and get taxed at the owners ' individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LLCs and S corporations are treated by California tax authorities . The state levies a tax of 1.5 percent on the net income of S corporations , while it taxes LLCs on a schedule based on their gross income .  --  Paperwork . " There are some formalities of being a corporation , such as having a board of directors , officers , bylaws and board meetings , " said Gene Takagi , a San Francisco attorney with tax expertise . " If these formalities are really burdensome , there are advantages in converting to an LLC . But the state tax consequences may make you question whether becoming an LLC is advantageous compared to an S corporation . "  --  Self-employment taxes . With an LLC , distributions to owners are typically treated as salary for tax purposes , so you would have to pay self-employment taxes including Social Security taxes on them . But with an S corporation , Takagi said , you could pay yourself a reasonable salary and then take the remaining profit as dividends for which you would not need to pay self-employment taxes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S corporation , the change may not be very difficult . Switching from an C to an S corporation requires , among other things , filing forms with the IRS , Takagi said . Switching to an LLC can be done as a statutory conversion with forms and instructions available from the California secretary of state .
