The best-selling author 's latest , Finger Lickin ' Fifteen , is out June 23 . Janet Evanovich will now take your questions . This is the 15th novel in the Stephanie Plum series . Have you ever felt that the quality of your stories was declining ? Dodie Stephens , OCALA , FLA . I do n't feel that the quality of the stories is declining . I think that some books are more successful than others to certain readers . People who read my books for the humor , they 're going to love one book . People who read my books for the mystery , they might not like that book quite as much . There is so much talk about a Stephanie Plum movie . Do you have an explanation of why it has taken so many years and if it will ever be made ? Kimberly Johnson , FAIRFAX , VA . My fans would love to see a movie , and I would love to see a movie . It just has n't worked out so far . I think they love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what these two hot guys look like , Ranger and Joe Morelli . Is it sinful to lust after a fictional character ? Margaret Smith FOLSOM , CALIF . Not in my world . If you want to lust after my characters , hey , I 'm all in favor of it . What made you want to write , and how did you get started ? Linda Olsen ROSWELL , N.M . I was n't always a writer . When I went to college and majored in fine arts , I was a painter . Then I was a stay-at-home mom . Somewhere along the line , I realized that I liked telling stories , and I decided that I would try writing . Ten years later , I finally got a book published . It was hard . I had no skills . I knew nothing about the business of getting published . So I had to keep working at it . Do you have a set routine you follow daily in writing books ? Mary Gehin BELLEVILLE , WIS . I 'm at my computer at 5:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . Then around 1 o'clock , I have lunch . I get a little exercise . Then in the afternoon , I 'm a businessperson . I think of myself as a professional . I get up in the morning and I go to work just like anybody else . Have you ever felt inclined to use your success to bring awareness to a certain issue ? Tash Nordstrand AUCKLAND I think it 's appropriate for some authors . I do n't think it 's appropriate for me . I look at myself as an entertainer . You know my books are going to end well , you know you 're going to love some of these people , you know I 'm never going to kill a cat -- and you can count on the fact that I 'm not going to put my political agenda in your face . That just is not what I do . Why do you let readers title your books ? That sort of seems like letting strangers name your children . Walden Henning , INDIANAPOLIS Yeah , like wearing somebody else 's underpants -- not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so lots of years ago , readers were sending in their ideas for titles , and what we realized is that they were smarter than us . So we thought , Hey , go for it . So now we have a contest every year . Will the Kindle and other e-book readers help or hurt the book industry ? Taylor Zaborney MIDDLETOWN , N.J. I think that the e-book is here to stay . I think it 's fabulous . Can you imagine kids ? No more backpacks full of heavy books . But what happens when I go on book tour if all we have are e-books ? What do I sign ? Body parts ? Are you planning on ending the series anytime soon ? Tracy Simpson NIAGARA FALLS , N.Y . No . You know , I wake up some days and think Stephanie should go off into the sunset with Joe Morelli and have babies , and then I wake up the next day , and I 'm like , Oh , no , she 's got ta go with Ranger . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm having a lot of fun with it . If you could do anything else with your life , what would it be ? Jennifer Frieouf BRAMAN , OKLA . I 'd be a bar singer . And I 'd wear a really low-cut red sequined dress . Maybe I 'd want to sit on a piano . I 'm stopped by the fact that I ca n't sing , but , you know , aside from that .
