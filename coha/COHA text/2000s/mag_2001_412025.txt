Section : THE ARTS EXCLUSIVE : How a little-known New Zealand director landed the most ambitious franchise in movie history . <p> The helicopter floats toward Kahurangi National Park , and New Zealand unrolls beneath you . You see farmlands almost fluorescent green . Mountains straight out of a model-train set . Craggy limestone plateaus . Giant ferns waving along beaches . And strange , tilting rock formations that look like primitive graveyards . Before coming to the land of " The Lord of the Rings , " you 'd heard two things over and over , the first of which concerned the landscape : as Liv Tyler put it , " It literally looks like somebody laid a velvet blanket down on New Zealand . " It 's hard not to feel moved as the helicopter flies between mountaintops filmed for the trilogy  --  even when you start throwing up in the back seat and the pilot has to make an emergency landing on a deserted beach . After you wash your face in the sea , you walk back toward the whirring helicopter and notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay down because they do n't want you to get decapitated . That 's the other thing you 'd heard about New Zealand : everybody 's really nice . <p> In truth , you did n't come to the Southern Hemisphere because of the landscape , but because a director named Peter Jackson has suddenly altered it . He 's brought to his native New Zealand , which has a tiny film industry , the most expensive and manifestly ambitious movie project in history : a trilogy of fantasy films based on J.R.R. Tolkien 's novels shot simultaneously for a combined cost of at least $270 million . The first movie , " The Fellowship of the Ring , " will be released on Dec. 19 ( see review ) , with sequels set for Christmas 2002 and 2003 . By 2004 Jackson may be hailed as a visionary like George Lucas  --  already considered a done deal by many " LOTR " fans on the Internet  --  or he may want to throw himself into the fires of Mount Doom . All of which raises some questions , chief among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , in Wellington , the director drives you to one of his two special-effects companies , Weta Digital , parks and pads barefoot toward the door . Before he gets there he 's intercepted by some 10-year-old boys on bikes , one of whom calls out , a bit intensely , " Are you Peter Jackson ? " Jackson , 40 , is a shy person . He says , " Hmm ? " He 's stalling . <p> " Are you Peter Jackson ? " <p> " P'raps . Could be . Why ? " <p> " Are you famous ? " <p> " No , no , no , no , no . Absolutely not . " <p> " Are you Michael Jackson 's brother ? " <p> Jackson laughs . His belly ripples a little . " Ah , " he says , before making a quick getaway , " now you 're getting close . " <p> Jackson 's previous credits ( a handful of gory splatter films and the indelible " Heavenly Creatures " among them ) tell only part of the story of who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refer to the director as a hobbit . Fran Walsh  --  Jackson 's mordantly funny partner in life , parenting and moviemaking , who co-wrote " LOTR " with Jackson and Philippa Boyens  --  believes that that 's simply because the director resembles one . " You do n't wear shoes , " she tells him one day . " And you 're a lul ' bit round and a lul ' bit  --  " She says something that , in her New Zealand accent , sounds like " fairy , " but surely could n't be . You ask her to repeat it twice , and finally you get it : " Furry . " <p> But it 's not just Jackson 's looks that call hobbits to mind . In " The Fellowship of the Ring , " trembling , hairy-footed hobbit Frodo Baggins , who 's played by Elijah Wood , learns that he can save Middle-earth from the evil Sauron only by trekking into the heart of darkness , Mordor , and hurling the all-powerful ring into the flames in which it was forged . Filming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by much . " LOTR " was an impassioned , but draining , all-consuming  --  and , at times , quite chaotic  --  shoot for everyone involved . ( " Exhausted ? ! " says costume designer Ngila Dickson , laughing . " We were deranged . " ) The cast and crew ca n't remember ever working so hard , and no one even pretends to have worked as hard as Jackson . " Peter paid a huge price for this film , " says Walsh . " He lost his father in preproduction and his mother just a few weeks ago . He went in with parents , and he came out an orphan . " <p> Jackson grew up in Pukerua Bay , about 30 miles up the coast from Wellington . His mother was a housewife and community booster , his father a paymaster who drove around town in an armored car and paid city employees . " I am definitely the product of both my parents , " he says . " I feel it more acutely now that they 're gone  --  I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad was sweet , and preternaturally calm no matter the circumstances . Mum was utterly driven . " The one thing that I 'm totally grateful for , beyond anything else , is that they never judged my hobbies , " says Jackson . " I loved monsters . I loved making movies with my movie camera . I loved making dinosaurs with Plasticine , and if I wanted more Plasticine , Dad would go out and buy it for me . They never had any judgment other than total support . " <p> By his early 20s , Jackson was deep in the thrall of the famous stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen ( " The 7th Voyage of Sinbad " ) and had had a transcendent , life-defining moment watching " King Kong . " While working as a photoengraver at a local paper , he launched a career shooting no-budget genre movies on Sundays , playing one or two roles himself if he had to . Jackson 's early films  --  the gross alien movie " Bad Taste , " the very gross puppet apocalypse " Meet the Feebles " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  are comic and strangely childlike , full of Monty Python-esque farce and an obvious passion for the goriest , squishiest special effects that next-to-no-money can buy . As Jackson fondly says of both himself and his longtime special-effects artists , Richard Taylor and Tania Rodger , " It 's like naughty children having a good , good time . " In four hours ' worth of interviews , the closest the director ever comes to bragging is when he reflects on " Braindead , " which was released in the United States as " Dead Alive " : " We made it in a local television studio , and we trashed the carpet . We had zombie extras trailing blood everywhere . They shoot game shows in the studio these days , and somebody told me that if you look up even now you can see blood splats from ' Braindead ' on the studio roof . " <p> Though 1994 's " Heavenly Creatures " had its share of blood , it was a radical shift for Jackson , putting him on Hollywood 's radar screen and earning him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The movie was a devastating , true-life portrait of two teenage girls named Juliet ( Kate Winslet ) and Pauline ( Melanie Lynskey ) , who struck up an extraordinary friendship in New Zealand in the ' 50s , freaked out their parents , lost hold of reality and , in a misguided attempt to stay together , beat Pauline 's mother to death with a brick following afternoon tea . Suddenly , Jackson had to direct not zombies but girls who 'd never made a movie and who were overwhelmed by the emotions of the roles . " I always felt incredibly safe with Pete , " says Winslet . " He 'd always come up very quietly , always put his arm around me . He 'd say , ' Do you feel OK about this scene , Kate ? ' You ca n't fail to love Pete . He can be quite quiet , but he 's an emotional man . Look , I 'm telling you , when we wept , he wept . " <p> Jackson 's first movie for Hollywood , a ghostbusting comedy called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a champion in Robert Zemeckis , but the studios got nervous about him , and the director struggled and failed to remake two of his longtime obsessions , " King Kong " and " Planet of the Apes . " Fortunately , he had a third longtime obsession : the story of Frodo , Gandalf the wizard ( Ian McKellen ) and the rest of the fellowship . " I 've always thought fantasy was the last frontier of cinema , " he says . " It 's the only genre that 's never really been mastered . The characters are always so cliched . I mean , I actually hate wizards in movies  --  they 're always terribly pompous , and they tend to fire blue lightning bolts from their fingertips . " ( No , Jackson is not referring to " Harry Potter " ; he says he enjoyed that movie , though all the other " LOTR " folks you talk to about " Potter " thought it was lame . ) <p> Why did New Line Cinema trust the former Kiwi King of Splatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its reasons ( see sidebar ) , and Jackson has a couple of theories of his own . For one thing , he says , he already co-owned two great special-effects shops : Weta Digital , which could make armies swarm ferociously and somehow get a towering , computer-generated Balrog to spout actual flame ; and Weta Workshop , which could make museum-quality armor , sleek , evil miniatures of the Tower of Orthanc and about 48,000 other artifacts for the film . For another thing , Jackson lived in New Zealand , and could make the movies far cheaper than they could have been made in the States . As he puts it , " If an American director had the same amount of passion as me and a career that was similar to mine  --  if he did the same meetings that I did , and said the same things that I said  --  he still would n't have been able to get his film made . Because he would have been in the wrong country . " But folks who have worked with Jackson say his modesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says McKellen . " They 're both pink . You can never be certain which one he 's got on . But there 's a lot of energy under there  --  and willpower and ambition . " <p> He needed every bit of it . At the height of the epic , 274-day " LOTR " shoot , Jackson had to command and choreograph an unheard-of seven camera crews working simultaneously to get the staggering number of shots required . His partner , Walsh , was deputized to film a moving scene between two hobbits toward the end of the first film , among other things . Producer Barrie Osborne ( " The Matrix , " " Face/Off " ) stepped up for some battle sequences , as well as a gorgeous helicopter shot of Frodo and his companions walking up a startlingly white glacier . And on and on . Jackson would sit in front of as many as seven monitors , directing by satellite feed and often bicycling back and forth between film crews . <p> There were real-life floods , landslides and snowstorms to contend with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more vacations . There were also ongoing script revisions for Liv Tyler 's character , the immortal elf Arwen . ( Tolkien fans chastised the filmmakers on the Internet when it was rumored that Arwen was being reimagined as a sort of warrior princess . Jackson did shoot footage of Tyler at war  --  in a hilarious bloopers reel made for a party at the end of filming , the actress is seen fumbling adorably with a bow and arrow during the Battle of Helm 's Deep  --  but ultimately the director reverted to a less bloodthirsty , though still bold , vision of Arwen . ) Everyone soldiered on . " There was one gigantic battle sequence that some of us worked on all night every night for three months straight , which is insane , " says Viggo Mortensen , who plays Aragorn . " It was dark and wet . That was a real tough one for the cast and crew , and it forged some strong friendships . " Jackson , it 's said , was astonishingly calm and focused all the while . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story began with a helicopter shot of the landscape , let 's end it with an interior . Before leaving New Zealand , you visit Jackson and Walsh 's home on Karaka Bay . They 're such a quirky , unlikely couple that it 's not even annoying that they 're crazy in love . ( " Sometimes I 'd be on set , " says Elijah Wood , " and Fran would call Peter on his cell phone for some information , and Pete  --  his voice would change and his whole body would change when he heard her voice . " ) As Walsh walks to the kitchen for lunch , she passes a room crammed floor to ceiling with boxes . It 's Jackson 's sanctuary . He collects miniature soldiers . Models of World War I biplanes . And a million other things , from the looks of it . Walsh gestures to the room , and says , drolly but not unfondly , " That is what the contents of Peter 's mind look like . " Sounds about right . Jackson is a director with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to open every one . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Frodo ( Wood ) pauses for a rest at Rivendell , a quiet elven village <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Jackson , in a sea of props from Weta Workshop <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : WISH YOU WERE HERE : When a nervous Ian Holm arrived to play Bilbo , McKellen ( Gandalf , left ) calmed him : ' You wo n't want to leave .
