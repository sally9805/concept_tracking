The elegant curves of the back and legs help disguise the functional nature of this storage bench . // A coiled hose is a necessary evil in a garden-you need one , but when it 's not in use , who wants to see it ? Instead , you can store one or two hoses in this handsome bench . It 's built from l-by-6 boards ; we used ipe , a rot-resistant tropical hardwood , but you could choose cedar , redwood , or teak for natural beauty and durability . The key parts of the bench are the front and back legs-both have mitered comer joints and rounded bottoms . The rear supports are tapered in front to form a comfortably angled backrest . The top is held open with a hook and eye . The project , which requires intermediate woodworking skills , takes about two days to complete and should cost less than $200. - PETER O. WHlTELEY How to build a hose bench Tools * Table saw * Combination square * Tape measure * Pencil * Circular saw * Saber saw * Yardstick * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Hacksaw * String Materiels * 7 8-ft. - long 1-by-6s * Wood glue * 30 2-in. square-drive trim-head screws * 60 1 - in. deck screws * 48-in. continuous hinge * 4 ft. of 24-in. - wide - in. galvanized wire mesh * 20 - in. trusshead screws * Wood sealer * 3 - in. hook and eye Directions Conceptually , this project is like building a toy chest with corner guards that serve as legs ; the rear legs are taller to support the backrest. // 1 . Start by making the legs : Set the blade of the table saw at 45 and rip ( cut lengthwise ) one board in half . From each half , use the circular saw to cut two 16-inch and two 32-inch lengths . 2 . Draw identical arcs at the base of each leg ( we traced a 1-qt. paint can to make ours ) , so each arc bottom ends at the miter joint ; cut with saber saw . 3 . On what will be the side pieces ( or backrest ) of each back leg , draw the tapered front edge ( see lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs mirror each other ; cut with circular saw . 4 . Assemble legs : Use clamps , wood glue , and countersunk trimhead screws ( at about 5-in. intervals ) . 5 . Cut from the remaining 1-by-6s : * 4 at 44 inches ( A boards ) * 4 at 16 inches ( B boards ; leftover 29-in. length will be cut into F boards ) * 6 at 46 inches ( 5 C boards , plus D and E boards ) 6 . Rip one 46-inch length into one 2 - inch- wide piece ( D board ) and three - inch- wide lengths ( E boards ; one will be cut into two pieces for four total E boards ) . Also rip the leftover B-board piece into two 2 - inch- wide lengths and cut one into two 14 - inch lengths ( F boards ) . // 7 . Attach A boards , spaced inch apart , to inside of front and back legs with deck screws ( two per end ) . Drill ( or cut ) a 1 - inch- wide circle in lower rear A board . // 8 . Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deck screws . Along the lower inside edges of A and B boards , use deck screws to attach E boards that have been cut to fit ; they 'll support the wire-mesh bottom . // 9 . Cut D to fit between rear legs and rest on top of upper back A board ; attach with trimhead screws . Use hacksaw to cut continuous hinge to the same length . 10 . Using the pencil and string , make curve for the top backrest board : Sketch an arc with a 7-foot radius on a C board ( the arc should start and end 2 in. above the board 's bottom corners ) , then cut with a saber saw . 11 . Use trimhead screws to attach one regular C board and the curved C board to make backrest. 12 . Assemble bench seat from remaining three C boards and the F boards , attached with deck screws . Center and attach hinge to the seat 's inside back edge ( a C board ) , then attach the assembly to the front edge of D. 13 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of E boards with trusshead screws . 14 . Seal wood .
