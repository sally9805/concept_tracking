<p> Flowers she never expected <p> When I was a little girl , my aunt Clo and Uncle Austin attempted to keep an eye on me as I played along Washington Avenue and explored Houston 's nearby back streets . Always , on a Saturday night , I went to their house , and my aunt would wash my long , blond hair and set it in bobby pins . The next morning , I would return to her and she would comb my curls and dress me in one of the Sunday dresses she kept for me in her closet . Then we would go to Trinity Tabernacle Baptist Church . <p> There , the preacher often talked about the terrible things that would happen to one who committed unforgivable sins . This worried me . I asked my aunt about it . How would I know if I committed an " unforgivable sin ? " She explained that when I was about 12 years old , I would understand the difference between right and wrong . When that happened , I would have reached the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountable " for my sins . This came as a great relief to me because that meant I still had some time before I had to start worrying about " sin " and " the fires of hell . " <p> Free to go about with my weekday fun and no longer worried about God writing down every move I made , my main objective remained - to keep my mother happy . Otherwise , I would be on the receiving end of the broad side of her nylon hairbrush . Knowing she loved flowers , I always tried to have a little bouquet waiting on the kitchen table for her to see when she came home from work . <p> My mother worked hard . In the daytime she was a waitress and , when there was no cook on the premises , or the lunch hour was very busy , she also prepared meals for her customers . Then , in order to relax , she had to go out several nights a week to some of the cafes along Washington Avenue . She was a fun-loving and good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parenting skills , left no doubt in my mind that she loved me . <p> When my mother 's birthday came , I managed to find a few buttercups , and using crayons , I drew a birthday card for her . Although I had done nothing special , when she came home that day she made a great deal out of my meager offering . Then she told me that some of her friends were throwing a party so she would be going out early and would probably not be home until late that night . She spent some time primping , and before leaving , gave me a big hug and kiss , leaving lipstick on my cheek and the scent of " my Sin " lingering in the room . <p> Left to my own devices , I rode my bike to the cemetery where I often played undisturbed . I entered through the back gates and saw the groundskeeper , who was leaving . I had not paid much mind to him before , but that day , he had something that really caught my attention ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp plants . From a distance , I waited until he got into his truck and drove away . When I was certain he was gone for the day , I rode back and parked my bike . I looked behind his shack . There I saw a huge pile of floral arrangements that , having lost full beauty , had been removed from graves . <p> My heart pounding with delight , I began sorting through the wreaths and plucking free the gladiolas , lilies and sprays of green fern that still had some color and dignity remaining . I put them all in a crumpled brown paper sack I found nearby . Then I added a sturdy stand to my cache along with several beautiful ribbons . On my bicycle , swerving from side to side , I hauled my bounty many blocks from the cemetery , up the back stairs of our apartment building , and stashed it in a vacant apartment . <p> Knowing my mother would not be home for a while , I went to work designing one of the most beautiful floral creations ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The arrangement consisted mostly of gladiolas and lilies , but I had also found several roses that still had their heads upright and petals intact . I draped the huge arrangement with ribbons . On one was printed " Mother . " Another said , " Our Loving Mother , " but the prettiest ribbon of all , I arranged across the entire array of flowers . In sparkling silver glitter on bright red were the words , " Mother , Rest In Peace . " <p> I left the flowers there , returned to our apartment and waited . I was awakened when my mother came in from her party . She fell straight into bed , fully clothed , and within seconds was snoring loudly . I eased over to the bed and spread her nightgown over her body , just as if she were wearing it . After that , I carefully arranged the sheet and blanket around her and even tried to fix the pillows . I folded her arms across her chest , resting one hand on the other . Not once did she stir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday present . It took a while for me to decide just where it should be placed , but I finally fixed it so that when she opened her eyes the next morning , that beautiful wreath would be the first thing she saw . <p> It was . <p> The next morning , a stream of profanity that I 'll not repeat awakened me . When all the hollering was over my mother sat back down on the bed taking a minute to catch her breath . <p> " Did you do this ? " She was still upset . <p> I nodded , cautiously . " It is your birthday present , Mother . I made it myself . " <p> It took a long time before the color came back to her stunned face , but soon I saw her lips twitch into a smile . After that , she exploded in laughter . <p> " Baby girl . . . " She started to say something but chose instead to give me a warm hug . In fact , she was so pleased that she took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work over at Ma Wagner 's . I followed her proudly . When she stepped in , everyone turned to stare . <p> " Well , Mae , did you kick the bucket and no one told you ? " someone remarked . <p> " Mae , you had to go to the cemetery to get your own flowers ? " another asked . <p> I stepped up front and center . " No , she did n't ! I went to the cemetery and got her those flowers ! " I announced . " That 's her birthday present . " <p> Mother placed the wreath behind the bar and walked into the kitchen with Ma Wagner grinning and waddling behind . I heard them talking and laughing . <p> " I wake up with the worst hangover I have had in years , I can barely open my eyes and the first thing I see is , ' Mother , Rest In Peace ' . For a minute there , I actually thought I was dead . I almost had a heart attack ! " <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As I have retold this story to others , some have suggested that , even at such a young age , perhaps subconsciously , I wanted to get back at my mother for some slight . Others have told me that because my mother did not give me all the attention I wanted , I knew exactly what I was doing when I fashioned that arrangement . <p> Let them say what they will , I meant well . Besides , I had not yet reached the age of accountability .
