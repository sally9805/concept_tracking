The Drowned Boy <p> Our ghost was the soul of a standard five . One afternoon , nineteen years before , the boy drowned while swimming in the far dam , up near the ruined , roofless buildings of what people still called Old Goas . ( We lived at New Goas , but nobody graced our place with that title anymore . ) Back then , the far dam had been used for the cows ' midday drinking . There had once been a fence around it so the farm hands could count the cows after they were corralled-this was when Goas had a lot more cattle-but the fence was also gone , as gone as the water , although you could see the remnants of it flattened into the ground by years of hooves . He was n't a very demanding ghost . Sometimes on winter mornings he 'd come and stand by our morning coffee fire . Still dark , we 'd huddle , jostling each other with our empty cups , waiting for the coffee to percolate . You knew he was there because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . At least this is what Obadiah said . That the boy was using whatever breath he had left to push the smoke out of his eyes . Obadiah also said the boy was a Tswana , the only Tswana at Goas at the time he drowned , and that he only visited our morning coffee fire for a little warmth and to be remembered a little . A boy who died so far from his people . It 's only natural , Obadiah said , nothing criminal about needing to be spoken of once in a while . Since nobody at Goas-except Obadiah and Tjambari-were even living on the farm when it happened , and even their memory of him as a real boy was blurred by so many years of other boys , we all used to make up things about him whenever anybody claimed the smoke was n't behaving according to correct meteorological laws . <p> Who said what did n't matter on winter mornings . We were too cold to care , and people murmured into their coats . It was one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Born in Gobabis , son of a rich chief , " said a voice . <p> " True , " said another . " His father-before the drought of ' 79 made him a poor man-owned four hundred head of cattle . " <p> " But at Goas , the boy roamed in bloody feet . ' A third voice , or maybe it was the first . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because not only was he the only Tswana , he was the only boy with such fancy lace-up shoes . A woman 's this time . It may have been Antoinette . <p> " So another boy stole them ? " <p> " Of course , from under his bed while he was sleeping . And rich men 's sons are not accustomed to walking barefoot in the thorny veldt . " <p> " Tender-footed , " I suggested . " But he knew how to swim . " <p> " True , " someone said . " He had lessons at the swimming pool for whites in Windhoek . " <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only sad : ' <p> " And then he sank : " <p> " And they did n't find him until the cows began acting strange . " <p> " They would n't drink any of that water . " <p> " Then they tramped the fence . ' <p> " Yes , and then a worker-not Petrus , this was before Petruspulled himself up and looked over the edge . ' <p> " His head was floating . " <p> We all talked-even Cecelia , who never talked-because who said what did n't matter on winter mornings . He was everybody 's story . Our feet were cold , our hands ; we crowded to the fire and hunched towards it with our empty coffee cups . It was less that the sun would rise than that the darkness would soon give way to pale . And we always returned to his loneliness , how he was the single Tswana on a farm of Hereros , Damaras , Namas , Coloureds , Ovambos . There were even two Bushmen at Goas then , two Bushmen who could at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terrified cows , something nobody ever believed , anyway , although they were always a part of the story . <p> Voices . Now more distinct in the changing light . <p> " Loneliness " Obadiah said . <p> " The nobility of it , " Tjambari said . " Our Lord , the same . ' <p> " He did n't call help . He must have known nobody would come . ' This was Miss Thaime , the principal 's wife . She taught the standard fours and , even on cold mornings , smelled of perfume and chalk . <p> Then a third voice , still unidentifiable , softer , still murmuring . It may have been Cecelia , but we could n't have known for sure because nobody knew what she sounded like . <p> " The cows watched . " <p> Nobody said anything after that . The smoke wandered away , towards the boulders beyond the toilet houses . <p> Moral Tale <p> Every morning meeting , the principal told a moral tale . We 'd stand more or less at attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light through the single window-not the sun , the sun would n't happen for an eternitycreep towards us from beyond the Erongo Mountains , east . Morning sounds : the murmurs of the boys coming to school from church , the slap of their bare feet on the concrete porchway , the whish whish of the classroom sweepers , boys on punishment from the day before . Often the principal 's stories came from the Bible and were retellings of Jonah , or Job , or sometimes , when he was feeling nostalgic and bitter at the same time , Ecclesiastes . Other times they were taken from the newspaper or picked up at the public bar in Karibib , where the principal always stopped on his way back to the farm from groceries . Most of the time-wherever they came from-they were somehow related to one of his own vices . One morning he was suffering guilt pangs over his embezzlement of school funds . <p> The principal was a portly man who wore a different tie each day of the week . It 's how we knew what day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his chin . When he spoke that morning , his Adam 's apple bobbed beneath his yellow Wednesday tie , as if , as Obadiah once said , his conscience was trying to escape his lying throat . <p> " Listen , colleagues , seriously and piously . This happened near Angra Pequena a hundred years ago , but it could have happened yesterday . " He paused and swallowed , allowed this thundering fact to settle upon us . " In fact , let us say it did happen yesterday . Yes , colleagues . Yesterday , three skeletons were found in the unforgiving sands of the Namib . God did n't create our desert . Hear this ! The Namib was born of God 's forgetting . He 'd meant to come back and put something there , but man gave Him too much trouble too early , and God never remembered . To return to our story : Two of the skeletons were found together , the third on a dune one kilometer away . All three were partially covered by sand and of similar age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all individually , one by one . He stopped at Sakatumbo , who was teetering , fighting hard to keep his eyes open . <p> " Lazarus ? " Sakatumbo had a new girl in Karibib and had come in that morning after hitching from town in the dead of night and then walking the long road from the C-34 to Goas . He had n't landed on his own bed in two days . The principal was the only one at Goas who called him Lazarus . " Lazarus ? Will you summarize ? " <p> Sakatumbo collected himself . " Three skeletons , " he said . " Two found together . The other some distance away . It 's curious . It smells . " <p> The principal resumed , not satisfied , but not willing to derail his story for the sake of telling Sakatumbo what he thought of him . Not yet , at least . " Indeed . The two skeletons were found with their heads crushed . The other skeleton was found with its head in one piece . In the small bones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed at Sakatumbo . " What ? " <p> " The rock he used to crack their heads , " Sakatumbo said . <p> " No-he did n't need that anymore . Diamonds . He was going to walk out of the desert a king . Even in death he gripped those precious stones . Imagine , please , how tight he must have held them in the Namib winds . " <p> Now the principal laughed , grateful he could pawn off his shame on someone else . <p> " You smelled something , " the principal said , scrunching his nose and sniffing hard . " I do also . Satan lurks this morning . Is not lust another form of avarice ? God forgot the Namib , but he remembered to punish the third man , and He , in all His glory , wo n't forget grown teachers who chase young dresses and neglect their duties to learners , either . When are you going to be too old , Lazarus ? Woe unto you ! Repent , I say . Repent ! " <p> That afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the Erongo Mountains dance beyond the blurry sheen of afternoon heat . We watched the goats wander languidly along the paths in the veldt . And we talked and we talked . Sakatumbo said he had a brother who worked for CDM in the south and got caught stealing diamonds that were shoved up his ass . Obadiah said Sakatumbo has more brothers than the principal has sins , but Sakatumbo flapped his hat . <p> " Truth . They caught him with an x-ray . He 's still in prison at Oranjemund . That was four and a half years ago . " <p> This got Obadiah started on the diamond fields and how Adolph Luteritz bought a tenth of the world 's wealth for three hundred breech-loading rifles and a wagonload of cheese . And of course Tjambari-who everybody said still had faith in God ( that 's how people described him , Tjambari who still has faith in God ) - could n't stop himself from adding that Luteritz drowned in the Orange River after his boat tipped over . " He never got rich , " Tjambari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single stone . " <p> But Sakatumbo did n't want to talk about history or the wicked getting their just deserts or God 's sense of justice . He wanted to talk about his brother who was still in prison at Oranjemund for shoving a diamond up his ass . " One diamond , " Sakatumbo held up a finger . " Or two ? " Tjambari only rubbed his hands together . He wanted to pray for the deliverance of Sakatumbo 's soul , but he would n't dare do it in front of him . <p> A Spot Northwest of Otjimbingwe <p> It was called the most savage raid on colonial forces in the whole bloody history of German South West Africa . Hendrich Witbooi and his men-answering a call from God ( according to Witbooi 's diary ) - attacked Otjimbingwe , without warning , on the night of January 19 , 189o . Five thousand imperial troops led by Hermann Goering , hapless father of the future Reich Marshall , were stationed in the barracks , fast asleep on that sweltering summer evening . The raid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goering himself was forced to flee and , in what must have been a particular humiliation , reduced to begging the protection of the British Garrison at Walfish Bay . Not surprisingly , the Germans did not allow the attack to go unanswered and stormed back three months later following the arrival of fresh recruits from the Fatherland . Witbooi retreated to the uninhabitable sand wastes and clay buttes northwest of Otjimbingwe . <p> One Monday morning , Obadiah , carrying a long stick , marched his class-thirty-seven standard threes in light blue button-downs , holding hands , two by two-away from school , up the dry riverbed . After trudging through the sand for what felt to the boys like twelve days , Obadiah abruptly stopped . He jammed his stick into the sand . " Cherubim , " he said . " Tell me what makes this place significant . " None of the boys said a word . They tried not to even breathe . At that time of day , late morning in March , everything looked bleached , coated with dust . The sand , trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of plaster . Above , the sky allowed for no variation in the blue glare . All around the boys was semi-desert sameness , and they were hungry , so , so hungry-teacher had made them skip morning break ( Monday is egg and tomato sandwiches ) for this expedition . Pocked across the dry riverbed were a half-year 's worth of goat hoof-prints accumulated since the last time it rained . Plus , the goat shit in neat little piles like tiny pyramids . What here could be worth all that walking ? <p> " Fortitude , " Obadiah said . " This is an important word , leprechauns . It means having the courage to fight when your body says , Asseblief makker , no more , makker . Hendrich Witbooi had it . Write it in your notebooks when you return to class . Use it in a sentence . For instance , Witbooi had fortitude , indeed : Look at this staff , my children , alone , here in the sand , silent as a pillar . Even fortitude needs to rest sometimes . Witbooi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men northwest . Yes , children , northwest towards Goas , and he stopped exactly here . " <p> The boys looked , languidly , at the stick leaning crookedly out of the sand . <p> " This spot ! Even fortitude must stop and take a breath of pure desert air , this air of freedom ! Listen , boys . You hear them ? The Schutztruppe in menacing pursuit . Think on it , little men of Goas . Of being chased , of riding for your lives ! But think on this also . Of all those killed in their beds . Yes , criminals , colonizers , but also men with beating hearts . Death to them , absolutely ! But with their heads on their pillows ? Was it not something Witbooi learned from the Germans themselves ? Take a pause . A great man rested here . Was it a victory ? " <p> Obadiah seized the stick , hoisted it to his shoulder , and scanned the line of boys . " Henrich Witbooi was the greatest shot with a gun since Jonker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was also a Christian down to his eighty-year-old noboot feet . I repeat , think on it . A heroic act of independence ? Certainly . But the beginning of a time of slaughter as well . Think of Maharero 's children walking to their deaths east of Okamatapati . You children , children of this newly independent nation-children of those children-I bring you here to Witbooi 's place of rest to remember the price of one man 's greatness , " With this , Obadiah thrust the stick back into the sand and began to walk slowly away , back towards school . Over his shoulder he called , " I provide no answers . ' <p> They stood and watched him . They 'd heard about this from the boys in the grades above , about drunk Master Obadiah 's stick in the veldt , but now that they were out there alone , they did what the other boys before them had also done . They stared at it . Now more awake , they stared at that stick . All thirty-eight boys , silently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another thought of taking it and using it to smack Reginald Shikongo , his enemy . Another , of riding on it , like he 'd seen a white witch do in a picture book . But one boy , Jacobus Tivute , listened for the pant of a hunted man and actually started to hear it . The noise was coming from the boy whose hand he held , an asthmatic , but it did n't matter . Jacobus was hearing that awful gasping . Looking around at the cragged trees , the tangled patches of sharp bushes , the wide , waterless river snaking away ahead , Jacobus thought , Bravery is more hell than cowardice . He hoped to grow taller and never have either , and he swore to himself he 'd remember this . Then Jacobus said a short prayer asking God , politely , to have mercy and let him leave this desert one day so he could go live in a town . After that he turned from the stick and , with his wheezing partner in tow , followed his teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Gandhi " Sakatumbo says from behind mirrored sunglasses . It happened in the north , in the bush near Oshikuku . Sakatumbo did n't claim he actually saw it , an odd thing for him to confess , and yet he 's certain it happened . " There are some things you do n't question , only repeat , " he says . An SADF T-34 roaming the veldt , searching for Marxist terrorists , Castro 's disciples , and suddenly a man with leaves on his head jumps out from behind a clump of thorns and begins to beat the tank , ferociously , with a stick . The two Boer soldiers inside watch him for a while through the scope . It 's a pretty good show after so many months in this wet Ovambo heat , fighting a war against shadows . They listen to the crazy smacking that reverberates . For every hit , they hear it twice . Someone 's knocking at the door , one of the soldiers sings . Someone 's ringing the bell . Do me a favor , open the door-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatch and shoots the man with leaves on his head once in the arm , but it does n't stop him . He keeps at it . Whack . Whack . The soldier shoots him again , this time in the chest . " The sound of single pistol shots is funny in a war like this , " Sakatumbo says . " Normally , you hear only automatics . " But the second shot does n't slow him down , either . The guy is dancing now . Dancing around the tank , bleeding and hitting . Now the tank is polka-dot red . It took two soldiers with helmets on their heads ten shots , Sakatumbo says , and even then he never drops the stick . " And you know what ? " <p> " What ? " I say . <p> Sakatumbo slides his sunglasses off his nose , incrementally , for dramatic effect . " He was a she . When they got out and looked at him , the man with leaves on his head was a woman . " <p> " Ah tut tut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever worry over is women . ' Sometimes , Sakatumbo lets his half brother Otto sit with us , provided he 's quiet . He 's a standard five and according to Sakatumbo too brainy , a source of both pride and annoyance . We are sitting on the top of Antoinette 's mealie sacks , outside the hostel kitchen , waiting for morning to be over . Otto is on the ground below us , reading a soccer magazine . It 's Tuesday . Cecelia will hang out her washing soon , which will give us something to do-watch her-but her door has n't opened yet . So Sakatumbo starts the story over again . <p> " Exhausted of death , " he says . " Of how easy death is now , a woman , a woman with a body black and beautiful as the Angolan oil that will never make us rich , gathers leaves in the north , my beautiful , my sacred north . Not like here . This is not a country here . This is not a farm . Cows eat sand for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as post office . " <p> " A baobab is not a tree " Otto says . " It 's the world 's largest succulent ' <p> Sakatumbo looks at me as if to say , See ? The kid 's a genius . Then he stands up on the mealie sacks . " Yes , " he says . " She dresses her head with noble leaves : ' He pantomimes putting leaves in his hair . " She 's not young and not old . How many years she carries does n't matter . She searches a good stick . " He pauses , stands on one leg , nudges Otto 's shoulder with an enormous big toe . " There are no men left in the village now . Only frightened little boys . " <p> Otto drops his magazine and stares up at his brother , who is now posing Christ-like , head drooping , arms outstretched , hands dangling . <p> " Why ? " Otto asks . <p> " What ? " Sakatumbo shrugs . " You want her to wait around like a goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way war stories werethey filled in the gaps of the longest days-except they were more horrible and left less room for heroism . You- do n't fight God . You do n't sneak up behind lack of rain . You do n't sabotage clouds . You die . At least back in the old days . Now drought means you breathe dust during the rainy season and food prices are higher at the grocery in Karibib and salaries remain the same and the government has to import more mealies from Zimbabwe . And cattle die . <p> But in ' 79 ( this happened to other people-to be a victim of drought meant you were a country person and no one at Goas admitted to being a country person though everyone was related to one ) the drought in the Kaokoveld was accompanied by an epidemic of rats . Rats who became just as hungry as the people . What happened was a rat ate a baby . This happened to other people , to a family no one knew personally , but it was true . Antoinette told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water she pirated from the school science classroom . She was wearing her green Sunday dress . During the drought of ' 79 , in the Kaokoveld , up in Africa , she said , not here , a starving rat ate a starving baby . <p> The Russian Waltz <p> " I 'm pleased we 're all here in the road , " Obadiah said . " Do you know why ? " <p> Although none of us intended to answer , he waited awhile . We were on morning break and tired and sitting-Obadiah , Sakatumbo , Klaas , and I-under our lone tree , the ancient , sun-withered camel thorn closest to school , which happened to be in the road that led out to the C-34 . <p> " We 're not learners " Sakatumbo said finally . " We 're the teachers . Let us be . " <p> " Wrong ! " Obadiah shouted . " It 's because good people , good people of Goas , the place for stories is in the road . You do n't tell stories inside a house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell a story , he herded us outside . My two brothers and four sisters , the whole family , except my mother who used to say my father made dead dogs look unlazy . She 'd come out , however , but she never stepped past our fence . Now understand , we lived on a dusty street full of rocks and dust , garbage , sleeping tsotsies , and my father would tell stories of the old times at the Old Location before they came with the bulldozers and moved everybody to Katatura , a place people still called , even when I lived there , This Place Is No Place . My father spoke of the Old Location as if it was God 's humble paradise . Then he 'd look around at our road , at all the boxes-not houses , he never called our houses houses-they were boxes pushed together with our tribe and number on the door , and he 'd say , I 'm an old man , and they expect me to fight . With what ? These old hands ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Pan-Africanist , a Garveyite . Further , he did n't condemn the militants ; he condemned those who forced them to become so . He often quoted Senghor : Lord , Forgive those who made guerillas/of the Askias , who turn my princes/into Sergeants . It was only that he was convinced there was a more peaceful way . He believed in education as the way to revolution ; he told us to put our fists away and read , that books were the great topplers . This was in the days of the second wave of uprisings , shootings , strikes . My mother was more radical . He shamed her . <p> " Once my father told us about a dance hall that had been in the Old Location . ' A dance hall was so big , ' he said , it was the size of a small country . ' From the other side of the fence , my mother said , Dance hall ? The whites treat us like the piss of dogs , and you want to thank them for letting us dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she spat . " <p> Obadiah paused a moment to think of his mother . <p> " No , she was n't a lady , my mother . Still , she was strong and would have gone and beat the Boers herself if she did n't have to prepare mealie pap for seven of us . My father feared her , but in public he pretended he did n't , so he hushed her , told her , Go home , woman . My father had an audience to worry over now . Neighbors had gathered around . Any activity in the road was better than nothing and if it was n't a riot , at least they could watch my parents battle . <p> " Size of Lesotho , ' my father said . Now in that dance hall , they held competitions , friends , dance competitions , and during one such event , your mother and I scored first in the Russian Waltz . " <p> Again , Obadiah waited awhile for us to say something . Sakatumbo yawned . Klaas , who 'd been marking quizzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Obadiah stood up and faced us . Then he held his arms out and made believe he was holding a woman , his body erect , one hand cupping an imaginary elbow , the other a make-believe back . He began to dance in the road that led out to the C-34 . <p> " Like myself , my father was a skinny man . His clothes never fit properly . So when he waltzed in the road with my second sister , his shirt flapped in the air so that he resembled a bird with shoes . He called out , ' A one and a one and a two and a two . Swing forward . Swing back . Draw , draw . Swing forward . Swing back . Draw , draw . " ' Obadiah 's version did n't look like a waltz . It did n't look like any dance at all , really . He was still a little drunk from the Zorba he 'd had in his morning coffee , and he was flailing , but it was a slow flail and as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , dragging his left foot along and his invisible partner . He was a little drunk and loving his father and his father 's story , and we were n't listening because it was n't the right time of day for this . It was break , and we had to haul ourselves to our feet and teach in less than five minutes , and we were just trying to get a little rest , in the road , by the shade tree . Obadiah kept circling . He 'd begun to look almost like a lame horse trotting , slowly , around and around , his left leg dragging . And still , he talked , more to himself now . <p> After a while , he stopped circling and dropped his hands to his sides . He was weary from dancing and remembering . As he peered at us curiously , I could see that his eyes seemed to have lost some of their fog . <p> " Understand , my father had not always been idle . He 'd been a meat packer . Thirteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they destroyed the Old Location , he went out on strike , against his will , with the rest of the men , and lost his job for good . Some days he found some work , most days he did not . Eventually , he stopped looking . However , I must confess there was something strange about those years . " <p> Up the road , the boys were starting to come back from the hostel , holding half-eaten carrots . We began to lace our shoes , gather our papers , strayed pens . <p> " This : My father never drank a drop of beer . He never drank a drop of anything . People said this was why he was so thin . Butand I have never in my life forgotten this cruelty-that day as he danced with my sister , my mother said from behind our fence , softly , because she knew she need not shout it , Better a man drink . " Obadiah stood in the road and looked at his feet . <p> The principal rang the triangle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dent on Klaas 's forehead from his knee . As we walked back towards our classrooms , Obadiah called out , " May I add one last thing , gentlemen ? " None of us turned around as we were working out what lessons could possibly keep the boys occupied in this heat . <p> " My mother had exquisitely long legs , " Obadiah apologized to our backs . " Are there not days when a son may imagine how they looked in a building that big ? " <p> Antoinette and Obadiah <p> Whenever anything sad happened at Goas , Antoinette would say the dead have been gossiping . After two of our standard sevens-coming back from January holiday-were killed when the lorry they were riding in the back of flipped over on the C-34 , Antoinette dropped to the sand , held her hands to her ears , and begged them to stop . Now talkers ! You talk too much ! Enough ! Obadiah and I helped her up . He was always kind to her when she broke down on account of other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own misfortunes , for which , he , Obadiah , was responsible . When she was calm again , the three of us sat on the bench in front of their house and watched the commotion in front of the principal 's office . The principal was standing in his doorway on the phone . A crowd of boys , many weeping openly , had gathered on the porchway . We 'd gotten word from the chief sister at the Usakos clinic and the principal was publicly-with great ceremony , but not without genuine sorrowcalling the parents of the dead boys . At one point , however , for all his love of ritual and power , the principal sat down , heavily , on the step that led up into his office , took the phone away from his ear , and slumped against the doorframe . Seeing this sent Antoinette back to cursing the dead and all their cheap , nasty , behind-the-back talk . Obadiah got angry then , tired of it . <p> " We are doomed , " he said .

Or perhaps he was from Windhoek , unaccustomed to driving on gravel , and driving too fast on our treacherous roads . Reasons . There are reasons those boys are dead , explanations . A police officer will investigate the cause and create a public report " <p> Antoinette , still looking at the principal , who had not yet responded to the wailing we knew he was enduring , stooped and picked up a rock at her feet . Without saying anything , she caressed it for a while . I wondered if she was going to smash her husband 's face . Instead , she went down to her knees again and began to beat the ground with the rock . Slowly , methodically , one thud after another . Obadiah chose not to take it further . He only sat there , stiff , not watching her , only hearing her , as he stared helplessly at the now completely silent crowd in front of the principal 's office . <p> Late Dusk <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night , something else .

She dominated him in ways we refused to imagine . And Klaas , maybe , was like a sailor uncomfortable on land , always directing his face towards the sea instinctively . Because whenever he was away from her , he was always looking in the direction of his house , even when he could n't see it . When he was at the Pick N ' Save in Karibib , for instance , he was always pointing his nose south , back to Goas . She must have cleaned that little house all day because it was always spotless .

Nobody on the farm was more predictable than Klaas . When the principal wanted something , he hopped to it , believing that one day he 'd become assistant principal should the principal ever condescend to anoint one . The fact that Cecelia was n't pregnant then , and , as far as anybody knew , never had been , led to all kinds of talk , most involving rumors of Klaas 's lack of sufficient firepower .

You also knew it would disappear as quickly as it arrived , that by tomorrow the dark stain in the sand would be as gone as the silence of the rain itself-we 'd learned this , that the rain carried its own engulfing silence , and that it , too , would leave us . As if none of it ever happened . The Erongos would emerge from the clouds and loom again , and the relentless sun again would pierce the cement walls of our rooms , and we would curse the rain for bothering us in the first place . <p> It had been a glorious downpour , but it had been going for more than two hours . It was no longer a miracle , and however fleeting and teasing , it always started as a miracle . Now it had worn away . It was just rain again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamonds in the toilet pit anymore , just rain . We were waiting for after rain . The land soggy . The water curdled in our footprints . The boys whittling sticks they planned to use to spear their fantasy fish . If we received enough water not only would the dry river flow , but also the road out to the C-34 . We were waiting for this , after rain . <p> We 'd all retreated to our rooms when Sakatumbo banged on his wall and shouted : " Mother Goas has birthed another lunatic ! " With our wet feet and toweled heads , we flung open our doors and saw Cecelia out there on the soccer field , whirling . Klaas was on his back , playing his fatty chest like bongos . She was wearing one of his awful straw hats , the round one with the wide brim , and laughing , her arms stretched out , her wet breasts swinging as if they were trying to reach out to her hands . Rain-worn , we loved her more . Sakatumbo kicked his door shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rammed my door also . The others , too . For once , our envy of Klaas spoke with one voice . It was too much . We shut up our windows and listened to the silence of our rooms , of our beds , as the dread rain pounded , pounded our corrugated roofs . <p> Author Affiliation
