Greenhouse Gas Reduction Has Become a Sellers Market // Can clean money be exchanged for dirty air ? That 's the premise of an emerging trade in carbon credits , which hold out the tantalizing promise of allowing industries to insulate themselves from greenhouse gas regulations by voluntarily agreeing to pay for " global cooling . " Emissions trading , the selling of federally recognized " right to pollute " credits from one industry to another , is well-established . But a specific market for carbon dioxide ( COz ) reduction is a product of the 1998 Kyoto Accords on global warming , which call for reducing worldwide COz emissions to below 1990 levels . Because some coal-burning utilities lack the technology to reduce emissions to Kyoto levels on their own , they are banking on greenhouse gas trades with farmers , who can " sequester " carbon ( absorb it through the land ) using such methods as no-till cultivation . That 's sent a host of carbon brokers to Iowa , Nebraska and Illinois in search of credit deals . These carbon trades , though engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no guarantees that any government will officially recognize the credits . That has n't prevented several major players in Canada , Australia , New Zealand , United Kingdom and the European Union from signing contracts . Unlike the US. , which still has n't ratified the Protocol , Canada has agreed to reduce emissions to six percent below 1990 levels by 2008 , at a rate of 100 million metric tons per year . That deadline lights a fire under Canadian greenhouse gas producers such as GEMCo , a Vancouverbased consortium of 10 major Canadian utilities , which recently purchased options on 1.4 million acres of Iowa farmland . The deal was handled by Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services in New York and the money funneled through IGF of Des Moines , the nation 's largest crop insurer . Photograph Midwestern cornfields may provide a partial answer for industries ( inset ) trying to reduce their green-house gas emissions . // An acre of farmland can sequester an estimated one ton of carbon . GEMCo will pay an average of $1.50 a ton to obtain 2.8 million metric tons of greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , according to GEMCo , because the credits become more valuable the longer they are held until the year 2008 , the deadline in the Protocol . " North American farmlands have the potential to offset a very significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions from this highly industrial continent , " says Aldyen Donnelly , president of GEMCo . Late last year , Australia set up the first official futures exchange in carbon credit trades and is expected to do an annual $5 billion ( U.S. ) in transactions . " Trading in carbon credits is a new market for the new 21st century , " said Bob Smith , CEO of States Forest of New South Wales . In the U.S. , regulators are so far keeping hands off the issue because there is no official American involvement in the Kyoto Protocol . " It is a real awkward situation , " says one high Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) official , who prefers anonymity . " They risk a lot . There are assumptions that that these deals will be honored . " The Washington-based Edison Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyoto Protocol is " severely flawed . " It points out that the Protocol , which is still being adjusted in worldwide forums , has not yet met the demands of a U.S. Senate resolution insisting that developing nations meet the same six to eight percent CO2 reduction by 2008 standard as industrial countries . " The futility of the Kyoto approach is made evident by the fact that the largest developing nation , China , is expected to surpass the U.S. as the single-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions by 2015 , " says the Institute , adding that the American taxpayer could be forced to pay hundreds of billions annually . In testimony submitted to Congress in 1998 , the New York-based Environmental Defense reported that a " business as usual " strategy could mean that the U.S. would emit 30 percent more greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 than it did in 1990 . Carbon credit programs provide many opportunities , the group said : Livestock farmers could drastically reduce methane emissions , the second-largest category of greenhouse gas ; farmers in New England and the Southeast could gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Northwest could be traded to leave more water in rivers , thus generating more hydroelectric power and reducing loads on fossil fuel plants . Traders are still advocating these deals as the best " market-based solution " to reduce worldwide air pollution . " What is missing right now are the rules and regulations , and that is why there is uncertainty , " says Gary Hart , president of the Emissions Trading Association . The agreements are definitely a gamble . " Until governmental rules define matters otherwise , greenhouse gas emissions are a figment of parties ' contracts , " says Mark Perlis , a Washington , D.C. attorney specializing in environmental law . " Would-be sellers of reductions or credits have no vested entitlement to any benefit under existing law . " Perlis points out there is no U.S. law that even so much as defines greenhouse gas credits . The uncertainty results in a very volatile market . Australian traders are paying prices that range widely from $10 to 5200 a ton . " The numbers are all over the board , " Hart says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The GEMCo transaction demonstrates the potential of the marketplace to provide low-cost solutions to address the greenhouse effect , " says Carlton Bartels , managing director at Cantor , the firm that brokered the deal . " The agricultural sector has a tremendous capacity for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and abating the emission of its own greenhouse gases . " Once a farmer has his land audited , he or she can choose to cash in the carbon emission reduction credits ( CERCs ) or hold on to them in a procedure similar to a futures call option . Prices escalate as the schedule draws closer to the 2008 deadline . Greg Lewis , president of CQuest , a Des Moines brokerage that deals in CERCs , said that for each dollar that a utility spends , 55 cents goes to the farmer and the other 45 cents goes for commissions , fees and salaries for brokers , land auditors and engineers who actually visit the farms and verify the CERCs . Buying and selling CERCS has tremendous potential , Lewis says . " I could probably sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The atmosphere is one big bowl of soup to which everyone can add or subtract greenhouses gases . The next step , says Lewis , is to set up an Internet auction system for CERCs . That may increase the volume of trades , with excellent prospects for reducing worldwide COz emissions , but it probably wo n't satisfy all the concerns of nervous investors . <p>
