THE SEARCH BEGAN with a library call slip and the gracious query of an elegant man . " I beg your pardon , " said the man , bowing ever so slightly . " Might I steal a moment of your time ? " He deposited his slip on the reference desk and turned it so that the lettering would face me . And if this unusual courtesy was n't enough to attract attention , there was also the matter of his handwritinga gorgeous old-fashioned script executed with confident ascenders and tapering exit strokesas well as the title of the book he requested . Secret Compartments in Eighteenth-Century Furniture played right to my fascination with objects of enclosure . " Let 's see what we can do for you , Mr. " I double-checked the bottom of the slip before uttering his improbably literary name . " Henry James Jesson III . " After I had directed him to the tube clerk , curiosity got the best of me , so I rang the stack supervisor and asked that she expedite retrieval . In a further breach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself near the dumb-waiter in Delivery , where I waited for the book to surface . " This is terribly kind of you , " Jesson said as I slid Secret Compartments under the brass grille . " Glad to be of service . " I was professional enough not to mention the uncanny overlap of our interestsI do n't meet many readers keen on lettering technique and enclosures . But that same restraint left memildly disappointed . The call slip was so enticing , our exchange so stilted and brief . Jesson settled himself at a table near the municipal tax codes . He quickly supplied further proof of a charmingly outmoded manner by digging deep into his capacious trouser pockets to extract a roll of paper , a tiny ink pot , and a calligraphy pen . Though he seemed to ignore the stares of nearby readers , he occasionally glanced in my direction , as if to confirm that I 'd stuck around . Which , of course , I had . In fact , while he took notes on Secret Compartments , I took notes on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annotation . He wore billowy trousers of moss-green corduroy that had wale as thick as pencils . These he partnered with a button-down shirt of subtle stripe and a dainty chamois vest tied at the back with a fat purple ribbon . He had an indulgent-looking face and blue-gray eyes that recalled the color of the buckram on my compact OED . Despite a bump at the bridge of his nose and teeth that predated fluoridation , he was undeniably handsome , a scholar who appeared unencumbered by the tattered frugality of most academics I assist . Those , in toto , were my preliminary observations of the elderly man wishing to steal a moment of my time . * * * When the closing bell sounded , I sifted through the wire basket of call slips kept at Returns . My friend Norton noticed me swapping the calligraphic original for a quickly scribbled substitute . " A little something for your collection ? " I nodded . " What is it this time ? " " Just some furniture book , " I said , downplaying my interest . Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did n't want to be deflected from inspection by yet another sparring session . I located Jesson 's book without difficulty . Secret Compartments was filled with line drawings of card tables , glass-fronted cabinets , and pedestal globes , each image accompanied by a technical description of the mechanism triggering release . Norton glanced over my shoulder and chuckled . " Let 's see here . A book about false fronts and hidden recesses . " He paused . " Seems an awful lot like you . " Chapter Two AFTER MR . SINGH , one of our more vigilant exit guards , doweled through my satchel with his stick of polished pine , I said good night to Norton and started the long walk uptown . At a traffic light near Lincoln Center , on a stretch of Broadway that brashly disrupts the city 's grid , I withdrew the purloined call slip just as a taxi pulled up to the curb . The driver , compact and neatly dressed , jumped out , popped the trunk , and produced a small rug , which he unfurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warehouse topped by a miniature Statue of Liberty , he kneeled in prayer . While the cabby , oblivious to the rush-hour traffic , satisfied his devotional obligations , I focused on the slip , noticing for the first time that its lettering leaned gently backward , as if to corroborate the writer 's inclination toward the past . When the light changed , I put the slip back in my pocket , determined to investigate the origins of the beautiful script . I got home just as the sun was dropping behind the water towers . Mr. Lopez , wearing his super 's hat ( he also owned the corner bodega ) , was hosing down an old ceramic sign that said , NO LOITERING OR BALL PLAYING , a wistful reminder of quieter timesbefore the spray of fluorescent paint and nine-millimeter bullets blemished the brick , before teenage crack dealers hung sneakers from lampposts to advertise their drive-by business . " Hey , Mr. Lopez , " I called out . " Can we get the landlord to update that sign ? " " Eh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lopez said , " Okay , my friend , " his standard response to all complaints , whether about street crime , boiler malfunctions , or rats sharpening their teeth against the rotting wallboard . He turned to admire one of his children , who had just crawled inside the cabinet of a television set abandoned on the curb a week before . The little boy , discovering that an old paint roller served nicely as a gun , scanned the block for targets and soon found his father and me in his sights . As the child squeezed off imaginary rounds from inside the TV , I took a few quick notes . The natural place to register the scene would have been the " Enclosure " section of my girdle book , but I 'd determined long before to restrict that rubric to purely autobiographical entries . I opted for " Street Views , Misc . " A gypsy cab caught my eye . Once more a driver hopped out and yanked something from the trunk . This time the object was a black satin jacket that advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after careful inspection of the contraband , peeled a twenty from a fat roll of cash . As he was completing the sale , the nightly drug trade started revving up . " We gots blue . " ... " Blue 's doin ' it . " ... " Blue 's out . " The super grabbed his child from the TV cabinet and bundled him into the building . I followed close behind but stopped when I felt a crunch underfoot . I bent down and picked up an inch-long torpedo of plastic used to package crack cocaine . This is n't blue , I found myself thinking . There 's too much purple in the mix . Periwinkle , maybe , or cornflower . Suddenly I had a vision of the guys on the corner shouting , " Periwinkle 's doin ' it ! " and " We gots cornflower ! " Maybe I could scrounge up an offprint of " A System of Color Identification for Bibliographical Description " and convince the dealers to refine their patter . My attention shifted when an ebony BMW pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic whir . " Yo ! You with that fuckin ' notebook thing . You gots a problem ? " The challenge was punctuated with a prodigious gob of spit . Sensing there was little dividend in direct response , I smiled and ducked inside , taking the stairs two at a time . At the front door of our apartment , I tripped over the size 16EEE sneakers my wife keeps around to scare off intruders . * * * I hung up my jacket and satchel and checked the mail : credit card bills , the Dewey Circle quarterly , and a course bulletin from House of Paper , the arts center where Nic taught the odd course on pop-up design . There was also a letter from a library-school classmate I never much liked , announcing his
