Daniel Abraham 's short fiction has appeared in Asimov 's SF , Absolute Magnitude , The Silver Web , and a handful of anthologies , including Vanishing Acts and Bones of the World . His first tale for us is a clever crime story of the near future . Mr. Abraham reports that his first novel , Unreal City , is due to be published by Meisha Merlin early in 2004 . <p> " IT 'S NOT RIGHT , " I SAID , shaking my head , " and I know it 's not right . But I ca n't figure it . " Carly , my ex-wife , leaned against the stone railing and frowned down into the river . She had more lines in her face these days , and the black dress and good haircut made her look professional . Even the sunglasses seemed more expensive and grown up . Still too thin , though . Two kids came across the bridge on bicycles , whooping and yelling at each other . We were quiet while they passed . Carly took a joint out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled it out again , damping it with spit before she lit it . It was one of my old pet peeves , like the way she left the shower on while she was drying off and watched my email over my shoulder . This time , it was good to see , just because it made things easier . Still a nasty habit , though . " So who is the guy ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " I said . " He showed up at my place one day , just like any other client . He wanted a new life for a while . Nothing big . He just wanted me to make him a card , change the sequence to something close - you know , something that 'd give the same phenotype , pass the basic tests - but not too close . I figured he wanted cover for something I did n't need to know about . " " Standard , " Carly agreed . " Yeah , that 's what I thought . But when I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at me , a low cloud of burning hemp seeping out her mouth , thick as cotton . She breathed it away and tilted her head the way she did when she was really listening . It was the first time she 'd looked straight at me since I 'd walked out to the middle of the span to meet her . She was curious . She was hooked . " Middle of chromosome eighteen , right where there should be a great big lovely stretch of junk DNA , and I find this vicious oncogene . Breast cancer . Classic form and sequence . " " Weird-ass crossover ? " she suggested . " There were three copies , " I said . " Right up against each other . Not even a base pair in between . No way . " She nodded . " I do n't know who this guy is , but for sure what 's on that card is n't his genome , " I said , then paused for a beat and looked down at the river . " And I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So how do I fit in ? " " The guy said he heard about me from Damon Weiss , " I said . " I figured if it was a message , it was maybe for you . " The name hung in the air . I ran my fingertips along the smooth stone railing . Carly coughed out a little laugh , absolutely mirthless . The two bicycle kids were speeding through a little Japanese garden farther down the park , flying along paths so I could only see them in glimpses . " It would be kind of dumb to send a message through you , " she said . " No reason to think you 'd deliver it . " " I did , though , " I said . " And he 'd know I would . It 's this psychic bond guys get when they screw the same girl . " " Do n't , " she said . " Besides , if you would n't expect it , the cops would n't either . " " No . I guess not . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence stretched out , awkward and tense . Same as always . " I do n't know what it would mean , " she said . " I mean , if it was for me . " " Get a mammogram ? " " Jesus Christ . Has everything got to be a joke with you ? This is serious . " " Sorry . " " It 's not a game . " " I just thought you should know . Just in case . " She nodded and took another drag . " Yeah , " she said . " Well , thanks . " " De nada . Here , pass that over here . " I took a hit , then held the thin white paper in my hand . A hand-rolled joint filled with engineered pot from Iowa , burning cherry at one end , pink lipstick at the other . The whole thing was like living with her - nothing fit together but it all worked . For a little while at least . I passed it back . " So . How 've you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her like she 'd farted . She let it drop . " I 've got to go , " I said . " Wear more clothes . You 're going to catch something . " I walked away . If she waved , I did n't see it . If she said anything , I did n't hear it . She might have been flipping me off for all I knew . The path curved south , then bent west and spilled out on the street where the park ended and the university started . In between semesters like this , the people were few and far between , but the coffee shop was still open . I walked across the street , and then the plaza on the other side , wading through a flock of unimpressed pigeons . Eric Li sat at one of the indoor tables sipping from a cup of coffee and pretending to read a newspaper tuned to CNN . I slid in across from him . " You should n't have come straight here . She might have followed you , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . He looked up at me . I raised a hand and a waiter came over . I asked for a chai and a bar of khatra . Li curled his lip . I told the waiter to put it on Li 's bill . " I do n't think she believed you , " Li said . " She bought it , " I said , pulling the wire out of my lapel . It was no bigger than a needle , and matte black . " I lived with her for six years . I know what she sounds like when she 's not interested , and I know what she sounds like when she trying to act like she 's not interested . They 're different breeds . " Li did n't look impressed as he tucked the wire into his pocket . " I suppose we 'll know if you 're right when she tries to contact him , " he said . " She will . If she knows where he is . " " We think she does . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chewed the other . Li put his paper on standby and folded it under his arm . " I wanted to be a cop when I was a kid , " I said . " You realize I graduated high school in the top five percent ? I was damn near valedictorian . " " Your broken dreams of childhood touch me . " " Fine , then . Make your own small talk . " " We 'll be in touch , Mr. Pagliacci . " I GOT BACK TO my studio in the middle of the afternoon . There were eight messages on my system , all junk mail . I watched one of the porn ads all the way through , just because the girl was cute . Gen 'd , but cute . I did a systems check and switched over to my business account everything triple encrypted with the latest algorithms so that the only way to get it was to hit me in the mouth until I wrote out the passcode . Or else do what Li had done ; ask nicely and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city forged documents or pimped or laundered data unless they also informed . If you played well with Li and his species , you stayed in business . If you did n't , you did n't . We were a tacit branch of law enforcement , unloved and unlovable . And because of that , we got to break the law . I read over three messages , checked the digital signatures . Two quick and dirty rewrites . One fresh build for a guy who apparently had lived all his life in some third-world hole and never got his genome on file . There was nothing that could n't wait , so I let them sit . It was a nice apartment , physically , though smaller than ones I 'd lived in when I was young-a testament to a life of lowered expectations . Tenth floor , but with a decent view of the bay . I 'd ripped out the drywall when I moved in , so it was mostly exposed brickwork now . The main room was about the size of a studio , but it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , genomic database , parallel generation array , and double-wide refrigerator took most of the space . The white noise made listening to music while I worked difficult . The back room - where I slept and ate - was maybe half as big as the front , but it was quiet . All in all , the place was about the size of one of Damon Weiss 's closets . My guess was Carly 's clothes would n't have fit unless she hung the shoes out the window . Since I had n't taken it until after Carly ditched me , I 'd never actually conducted the experiment . I waited for a couple hours , watching old movies on the system . When the first wave of nausea hit , I went to the back room , pulled up a trash can filled with newspapers I 'd shredded for the purpose , and waited . I put some oldies on the system - James Brown , Rabid Clan , Clash . The hardest working man in show business was just starting to shriek about how good he felt when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What happened to you ? " Kurt asked , pushing a cup of coffee across the table toward me . Any other morning , it would have smelled good . " Carly . " " Well that goes without saying , but the proximal cause , boyo . The proximal cause . " " Same . Carly . Saw her yesterday . " Kurt leaned back in his chair . His eyes narrowed to black slits . The clatter of fork on plate and the conversational hum of the cafe passed for silence while he looked me over . He was getting older too - no more the young punk with the heavy braided hair . He wore suits these days cheap , but suits - and he had more gray to the temple than I did . " No , you did n't . " " Did . " " What for ? " I shrugged and took a sip of the coffee . My stomach twisted like a live fish on a frying pan and I pushed the cup away . " You 're not .... Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up with the bitch now that Weiss is underground . You know how stupid that would be . " " I 've done my time , " I said . " You talking about the girl or the lockup ? " I smiled . " I had some business with her . That 's all . " " Yeah ? " " Yeah . " Kurt nodded and took a sip from his coffee cup . " You sold her to the cops , did n't you ? " " I 'm not saying that , " I said . Something passed over him - distress or disappointment . He leaned forward , almost over the table , and when he spoke his voice was low enough not to carry past the two of us . " Right . And so I 'm not saying that selling out Damon Weiss is more than your sorry ass is worth . Or that it 's just like those soulless bastards to lean on you to lean on her . Or that if I can figure it out , you can be damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop talking about it , and I mean at all . " " You 're not saying that , eh ? " " Nope . " " So why 're you talking ? " " I 've got such a pretty voice , " Kurt said , leaning back . I coughed and took out the cards-bright and shining , and coded with a plausible set of genomes along the lines Kurt had ordered , DNA I 'd cooked myself , microsampled , and bonded to the plastic . It was better than a fingerprint , and it would hold up unless they actually sequenced the whole thing out . Years of dealing poker showed in the way Kurt scooped them away . " Payment as usual , " I said . " It 's already in the account . " " Good . You got anything coming ? " " Yeah . I 've got a guy looking to skip bail . He needs a retrovirus mouthwash - just enough to beat the cheek scrape if he 's stopped at the border . " " He need a card to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How soon ? " " Two weeks . " " Ca n't , " I said . " I 'm low on virii right now . A month , and I 'll have everything I 'd need . " " He 's in trouble . I told him you were the best . " " And you do n't stay the best by screwing up a retrovirus . A month or find someone else . " Kurt raised hands , like he was afraid I 'd hit him . I leaned over and threw a little punch at his knuckles . He laughed . The waitress walked by with a plate of eggs and bacon . The smell must have turned me a little green , because Kurt leaned forward again . " You okay ? " he asked , his voice sincere for the first time since I 'd come in . " Seriously , you look pounded . " I looked down . If I was going to sell it , this was the moment . " You ever regret how you lived your life ? I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again without paying . And I get to thinking , you know ? Who I thought I 'd be by now . What I thought life would be like . And all the things that I thought were important back then ... it does n't carry the same weight now . " " You ca n't think about that . Guys like us , we 've got to keep moving . " " I know . But Kurt . You see I would n't have sold Carly out if I did n't have to , right ? They were going to close me down if I did n't . What am I going to do if not this ? Tech support ? " Kurt nodded . His black eyes only looked tired now . After enough years in this business , we had a lot of the same kinds of ghosts . " She screwed you over . Ratting her out ... hey , maybe it 's just karma , right ? The situation came up . Nobody to blame . It 's not like you set out to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I insisted . " I know you did n't . I know . It sucks . It 's just ... Jesus . If Weiss finds out . " " Or Carly . " " Christ , yes . Or Carly . " " Keep it to yourself , then . " " I will . " He would n't . Kurt had risen to his level of the profession . He was a connection , good enough not to give it away for free , but he would n't sit on something this big forever . He 'd wait until there was a good price for it before he sold me . The two of us had been friends for decades , and he 'd sell me . If I 'd played right , he 'd sell me to Li . " Thanks , " I said . I MET CARLY in college . I was writing papers for spare cash and still dreaming of going to med school . She was a chemistry major making her way by cooking meth and selling it out of the University Hospital ER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a while , we were perfect . She saw where we were headed before I did . My first big failure came in my senior year , hacking the anti-plagiarism spiders on the university system . It got to be a challenge , seeing how much I could get away with . For the most part , the teachers closed their eyes and trusted the tech . I 'd passed the same paper off six different times in a year before one of the professors actually noticed . The kid ratted me out , of course . I got thrown out more for the hack job than the papers . Carly told me then I was stupid . I told her I 'd get a better angle on it next time , but she did n't laugh . She set me up with a friend of hers who was fixing cards for convicts and foreigners - they were the only ones tracked way back then . There were two good years before we got married , then two more good ones after that , then a year and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . I came home late one night to our little place . I 'd been screwing around with two different waitresses from two different nightclubs , just seeing how long I could juggle it without them finding out about each other - or Carly about either - and I had my excuses all lined up . Stories about where I 'd been and why I 'd been there . Carly was waiting for me . Her bags were packed . As I remember it , I did n't say anything much at first . " I 'm out , Pag , " was how she put it . I asked her why , as if it was n't obvious . " You 're still a little kid . Everything 's a game to you ; it does n't matter if an angle makes sense as long as you think it 's pretty . You 've always got to prove you 're smarter than anyone else , and it makes you stupid . " I told her that did n't make any sense . Being smart did n't make you stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little artistry , where was the problem ? She just shook her head , picked up her bag , and headed for the door . " You want to be an artist , do it on your own time , " she said , and that was the last I heard of her for years . I did n't think to check the bank accounts until morning . They were cleaned out . I lost clients more because no one wants to put their lives and chances for prison in the hands of a man who is not only working for the cops but also drunk off his ass and likely to give you a card that codes you as the wrong gender . I spent a couple years in prison because I got sloppy . I blamed Carly , though . When she and Weiss got married , I decided to put myself back together . The night they headed off for their honeymoon , I proposed to a red-headed girl who lived down the hall . She said no , and that I was drunk . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me with his **31;1066;TOOLONG story , I 'd been apart from Carly longer than I 'd been with her . I knew for sure because I 'd done the math . Weeks passed with no word from Li or Kurt . I was still thinking about Carly , about Weiss , about the ways that two men who love the same woman are rivals and the ways that they 're the same , when my system told me about the guy . He was short , balding , swarthy , and standing outside my door , shifting from one foot to the other like he had to piss . Amateur , I thought , and opened the line . " What ? " I asked . On the system console , the guy leaned in like he was talking to the door . " I 'm looking for a Mr. Pagliacci . I ... I understand he does some consulting work ? " " Put your arms at your sides , " I said . " You 're being scanned for weapons . Do n't move until I say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned off the audio . The poor little puke actually seemed to believe I had some kind of sensor array outside . I took a beer out of the double-wide , twisted off the cap , and sat there watching the guy until it stopped being fun . " Okay , " I said , loud enough to carry through the door even without a channel open . " Come on in . " The guy looked more or less the same in the flesh . Small , mousy , nervous , amateur . Looking back at it , I have to say I did n't have a clue . The guy was a pro . " What can I do for you ? " " I ... um ... I need a card . I 'm in a little trouble . I have to get in to see my wife . Well , my ex-wife . But she has my card blocked , see ? I ca n't even get in her building , so .... " I held up a hand . " I do n't need details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over , smiling an apology as he did . I slipped it into the reader , waited while it did the analysis . I went into my routine about costs and options , the words coming out by muscle memory , I 'd said it all so many times . The guy leaned forward , like he was sucking in every word . He must have been pissing himself laughing on the inside . The reader chimed . I lost my place in my patter and pulled up the system output . The genome was mine - the sequence to build a fresh Pagliacci - except for a doubled testis determining factor on the Y. A portrait of the fixer with twice the balls of any ordinary man . It might as well have said I will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the Moon . You get them , Carly , I thought . Give " em hell . " I 'm not under surveillance , " I said . " You can talk straight if you want . " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking character . " Sorry , " I said , pulling the card and going with the farce . If I 'd been doing his job , I would n't have trusted me to know whether I was being surveilled either . " Okay . No , I ca n't do it . You 've got some pretty specific markers there . If you really want it , it 'll be viral work , and that 'll take time . " " But she 's leaving in a month ! " Now that I knew to look for it , there was a twinkle in the guy 's eye . He was enjoying himself . " You want my advice ? " The guy nodded . " Forget about her , " I said . " Keep going after a woman who does n't want you around , it 'll only make you sad and crazy . " He made a few more weak objections , turned , left . I had the system lock down the door behind him . I took out the log that included the guy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Eric Li could whistle for it . It was like the moment playing a dangerous shot in a game of pool when I 'd sunk the ball I wanted , and the only thing left was waiting to see if the cue ball stopped before the scratch . It was a cool afternoon . The night 's rain had cleared up and the Sun shone impotently over the bay . Li looked up at me , his expression reproachful . " You 're late , " he said , his breath ghosting . " I 'm here . " I sat on the bench beside him , hunched into my jacket , and looked out over the bay , smelled the salt in the air , listened to the racket of gulls . Anything but focus on Li . He was silent , and I could see him in the corner of my eye , considering me . I shrugged , trying to look bored , trying not to sweat , fighting the sensation that my balls were trying to crawl up into my belly . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good for you . " " Twenty minutes after she left the meeting , she called an anonymized system in Brazil . " " Okay . " " The next day she sent another message to the same place . We had the right monitors on . We traced it . " " You traced an anonymized system ? " " We 're good at what we do . But we have a problem . " Panic and despair can feel a lot alike . The heaviness in the belly . The sense of nausea and vertigo . The feeling that everything that had ever happened before was getting erased . All your decisions are already made - the past passes judgment . " What 's the problem ? " I asked . " You . You very nearly gave our game away . If Mr. Datwyler had not been so civic-minded , he might have told your ex-wife that she had been sold . That would have been inconvenient . " " Kurt ? " " As you say . Kurt . " I did n't grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you little rat . " He 's a friend of mine . I did n't tell him anything . He just kind of guessed . " " Yes . So he said as well . And that you were very much distressed . " " I had to talk to someone , " I said . " Carly ... Carly was important to me . She is important . " " You are still in love with your ex-wife . " It was n't a question . I looked over . Li was smirking now . " And so , you betray her . That 's very sad . " " What can I say ? You 've got such lovely eyes , Mr. Li . You ask me for something and I just get all aquiver . Now do we have some actual business to do here ? I 'm cold . " " There is a man who may come to you . His name is Isaac Roebbel . Whatever he asks , do it for him at your usual price . Then tell me what precisely he required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li did n't dignify that with an answer . I shrugged again and stood up . " If I see him , I 'll let you know . " " Yes , you will . " Li turned to his paper again . It was tuned to some kind of police newsletter . " Hey , Li . " He looked up . His expression was patient and sorrowful and insincere . " You let me know when you get Weiss , will you ? Not just know where he is , but actually get the collar . " " If you would like . You 're a very vindictive man , Mr. Pagliacci . " " Yeah , " I said . " I guess I am . " I CAME IN AT MIDNIGHT with a sandwich from the all-night deli on the street . The front room hummed , LEDs glowing like Christmas lights that never came down . I dropped the sandwich on the table , sat , kicked off my shoes and checked my system . Junk mail . I was about to switch over to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco . I got up slow , but she was already in the doorway to the back room . She was in jeans and a leather jacket . The cherry on her joint glowed in the dim . " Hey , Carly . " " Hey . " " What 're you doing here ? " " Depends on who you ask . Take your buddy , Li . Ask him , and I 'm not here at all . He 's pretty sure I 'm at a bar on Clinton . " " Taking off for good , then ? " She nodded and shrugged . She looked better without the sunglasses , younger in the half-light . Like when I 'd been with her , back when we 'd been young and things had been good , all possibilities open , all the games still winnable . " I miss Damon , " she said . " And it 's looking like he 's going to stay underground for a long time . " " He must be a hell of a guy . " " He 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes it all okay , then . You want a beer ? " " Sure . " I opened the fridge and pulled a couple of longnecks out , popping off the screwtops with a flick of the wrist . She sat on the PCR tank and took the bottle I offered her . " I fell for it , you know , " she said . " Yeah . Li told me . Sorry I was n't more direct . I was being watched . " " Figured . I mean , afterward , I figured . You got sick too , did n't you ? " " Had to , " I said . " Was n't another vector I could count on . You used a private doctor , right ? " " Damon has one on payroll . " " What 'd he say ? " " Just that I had a really nasty short-term gastric virus with a couple thousand extraneous stop codons on it . Then I remembered how you told me I 'd catch something . And two and two being what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd do . " " Hope it was n't too bad , " I said . " It was vile , but hey , thanks anyway . You want ? " She held out the joint , and I took it . Our fingers touched for a little bit longer than they needed to . The smoke felt good . " So this mean you 're not pissed at me anymore ? " she asked . " I 've been thinking a lot about ... about us . We were kids . And Weiss ... I do n't know the guy . And it looks like he takes care of you okay . So that 's all good . " " Yeah ? " " Sure . Why not ? He 's better than Li , anyway . The Chinese tweak 's going to burst a blood vessel out when he figures out the case went south on him . " " Hard life , " Carly said and reached for the joint . I passed it back . " What 'll you do if he figures it was you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm innocent , but he 's already got something I 'm guilty of . He 's pissed at me for letting it slip that I 'd sold you . It 's a trick I learned when I was inside . If you really need to get out of something big , frame yourself for something small . " Carly took another drag , holding in the smoke and considering the joint . " Good thing I was smoking that day , " she said . " Would have been suspicious if you 'd been trying to spit in my mouth . " " I would have kissed you . " " You would have tried . " I tried then . She watched me all the way in with a poker face so straight I did n't know if I was screwing up or not until she kissed back . " Damon would probably kill us both if we screwed right now , " I said . " I mean , even if it was just for old time 's sake . " " Probably . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead just yet . You want to come back in about five or six years , when we 've got a little less on the line ? " She kissed me again . Then , gentle and solid , she pushed me back and hopped down off the PCR tank . " Thanks for everything , " she said . " Denada . " I watched her walk away , watched the door close behind her . Outside , the Moon shone on the bay , just like it did when I was a kid . Carly was out there somewhere , and right now and for maybe another few minutes , her lips were going to taste like mine . I tried to imagine what he 'd do when he heard about how I 'd saved his ass . Chew his own guts out , I hoped . " I win , " I said , but Weiss , wherever he was , did n't hear .
