Jesus was nervous . The recruitment assembly for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter at Pearl River Central High School in Carriere , Miss. , was scheduled for April 12 , a mere week before the first anniversary of the Columbine tragedy . Like students all over the country this year , Brandon Smith , 16 , had been drilled on how to survive school violence . And now Smith , cast as the Savior in one of the fellowship 's skits , joked a bit tensely to his best friend and girlfriend , " You all , I 'm Jesus in this skit ; so if anybody gets shot , it 'll probably be me . " <P> Instead of opening fire , however , the hundreds of Pearl River students watching Smith 's mock crucifixion wept . They hugged one another , sang and testified to God 's greatness and admitted their troubles . When the morning assembly , scheduled for 90 min. , finally ended  --  five hours later  --  they knew a kind of fatigued ecstasy .

" We had no special effects , " he says . " It was me and an ugly brown robe . I thought , ' This is God . ' " <P> Within half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep for a microphone with which to praise God and confess sins ranging from attempted suicide to premarital sex to simple bad manners . Lee , rising to explain why her administration legally could not participate , found herself professing her own Christianity . " One atheist Madeline Murray O'Hair took prayer out of the schools , " Lee said , but she prayed it would return . " When she said that , " notes Judy Mitchell , one of the Christian athletes ' faculty advisers , " it broke the ice . Everyone said , ' I can do that , ' cause I 'm not going to get in trouble . ' " At least 450 of Pearl River 's 670 students remained , lunchless , in the sweltering gym . <P> Soon , word spread from local churches to Christian radio and the Internet , where
