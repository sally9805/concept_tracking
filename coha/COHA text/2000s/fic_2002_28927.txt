Blindsighted Low Price Chapter One Sara Linton leaned back in her chair , mumbling a soft " Yes , Mama " into the telephone . She wondered briefly if there would ever come a point in time when she would be too old to be taken over her mother 's knee . " Yes , Mama , " Sara repeated , tapping her pen on the desk . She felt heat coming off her cheeks , and an overwhelming sense of embarrassment took hold . A soft knock came at the office door , followed by a tentative " Dr. Linton ? " Sara suppressed her relief . I need to go , " she said to her mother , who shot off one last admonishment before hanging up the phone . Nelly Morgan slid open the door , giving Sara a hard look . As office manager for the Heartsdale Children 's Clinic , Nelly was the closest thing Sara had to a secretary . Nelly had been running the place for as long as Sara could remember , even as far back as when Sara was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks are on fire . " " I just got yelled at by my mother . " Nelly raised an eyebrow . I assume with good reason . " ' Well , " Sara said , hoping that would end it . " The labs on Jimmy Powell came in , " Nelly said , still eyeing Sara . " And the mail , " she added , dropping a stack of letters on top of the inbasket . The plastic bowed under the added weight . Sara sighed as she read over the fax . On a good day , she diagnosed earaches and sore throats . Today , she would have to tell the parents of a twelve-year-old boy that he had acute myeloblastic leukemia . " Not good , " Nelly guessed . She had worked at the clinic long enough to know how to read a lab report . " No , " Sara agreed , rubbing her eyes . " Not good at all . " She sat back in her chair , asking , " The Powells are at Disney World , right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should be back tonight . " Sara felt a sadness come over her . She had never gotten used to delivering this kind of news . Nelly offered , " I can schedule them for first thing in the morning . " " Thanks , " Sara answered , tucking the report into Jimmy Powell 's chart . She glanced at the clock on the wall as she did this and let out an audible gasp . " Is that right ? " she asked , checking the time against her watch . " I was supposed to meet Tessa at lunch fifteen minutes ago . " Nelly checked her own watch . - This late in the day ? It 's closer to suppertime . " " It was the only time I could make it , " Sara said , gathering charts together . She bumped the in-box and papers fell onto the floor in a heap , cracking the plastic tray . " Crap , " Sara hissed . Nelly started to help , but Sara stopped her . Aside from the fact that Sara did not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get down on her knees , it was doubtful she would be able to get back up without considerable assistance . " I 've got it , " Sara told her , scooping up the whole pile and dropping it on her desk . ' Was there anything else ? " Nelly flashed a smile . " Chief Tolliver 's holding on line three . " Sara sat back on her heels , a feeling of dread washing over her . She did double duty as the town 's pediatrician and coroner . Jeffrey Tolliver , her ex-husband , was the chief of police . There were only two reasons for him to be calling Sara in the middle of the day , neither of them particularly pleasant . Sara stood and picked up the phone , giving him the benefit of the doubt . " Somebody better be dead . " Jeffrey 's voice was garbled , and she assumed he was using his cellular phone . " Sorry to disappoint you , " he said , then , " I 've been on hold for ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara started shoving papers into her briefcase . It was an unwritten clinic policy to make Jeffrey jump through hoops of fire before be could speak to Sara on the telephone . She was actually surprised that Nelly remembered to tell Sara he was on the phone . " Sara ? " She glanced at the door , mumbling , " I knew I should 've just left . " " What ? " he asked , his voice echoing slightly on the cellular . " I said you always send someone if it 's an emergency , " she lied . ' Where are you ? " " At the college , " he answered . " I 'm waiting for the deputy dogs . " He was using their term for the campus security at Grant Tech , the state university at the center of town . She asked , " What is it ? " " I just wanted to see how you were doing . " " Fine , " she snapped , pulling the papers back out of her briefcase , wondering why she had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some charts , shoving them into the side pocket . She said , " I 'm late for lunch with Tess . What did you need ? " He seemed taken aback by her curt tone . " You just looked distracted yesterday , " he said . " In church . " " I was n't distracted , " she mumbled , flipping through the mail . She stopped at the sight of a postcard , her whole body going rigid . The front of the card showed a picture of Emory University in Atlanta , Sara 's alma mater . Neatly typed on the back beside her address at the children 's clinic were the words , " Why hast thou forsaken me ? " " Sara ? " A cold sweat came over her . " I need to go . " " Sara , I  --  " She hung up the phone before Jeffrey could finish his sentence , shoving three more charts into her briefcase along with the postcard . She slipped out the side door without anyone seeing her . Sunlight beamed down on Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill in the air that had not been there this morning , and the dark clouds promised rain later on tonight . A red Thunderbird passed , a small arm hanging out the window . " Hey , Dr. Linton , " a child called . Sara waved , calling Hey back as she crossed the street . Sara ...
