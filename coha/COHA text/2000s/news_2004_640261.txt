<p> ' Whatever advice you give , be brief . ' That 's some good , and brief , advice from the Roman satirist Horace . He died 2,012 years ago , but in our short-attention-span age , his words are probably more valuable than ever . Advice is hard to seek , hard to heed and difficult to pass on . But we all know we need it . Whether it comes in the form of wise counsel , a smart suggestion or a motivational axiom suitable for the fridge door , good advice can save us time , save us energy and save us from disaster . At its best , it can inspire us to get a little closer to the places we want to be . In that spirit , we asked 10 people who have found some success in life to share a little advice with readers . With a bit of prodding , they came up with some remarkably helpful guidance . We did n't give them topics , or suggestions , and we let the format of their wise words vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of respect for the economical Horace , we asked them to be brief . They were and here they are . Continued Federico Penya Former Denver Mayor Federico Peyna , 57 , now works with Vestar Capital Partners . He served as secretary of transportation and secretary of energy during President Bill Clinton 's administration . Whatever I have done in my life , whatever I have learned about success and fulfillment , it all comes back to these three things . 1 . Hard work . There really are no shortcuts . You got ta sweat , you got ta toil , you got ta really make your maximum effort . Whenever I 've had trouble doing something , if I look back I can see that I did n't give it all I had . 2 . Perseverance and tenacity . Too many people give up after meeting with forces that knock them off their feet and rough them up . They quit . I have , well , a doggedness that has helped me meet my goals . Often you do n't think you 're able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your feet and keep doing it . As Woody Allen says , ' Eighty percent of success in life is showing up . ' It 's a throwaway line , but I agree with him . 3 . Optimism . I try to be confident in myself and my ability to do things , my values and my belief system . That gives me optimism . It helps me be grounded and not susceptible to being pushed aside . Optimism helps me believe that yes , I can get this thing done . I was born with persistence and tenacity , but the other two I learned from my parents . I 'm a product of South Texas , born in Laredo and raised in Brownsville . I remember sitting around the dinner table , listening to my parents tell us about our family and where we came from and how proud they were to be a part of it . They told us we should be proud , too . And as a direct result of their example , I learned about hard work and sacrifice . I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still young , but as they say in Washington , right now we 're moving in the right direction . Ricky Bennett Bennett , 47 , has been chief of the Aurora Police Department since January 2002 . He has served with the department in various capacities for 24 years . Q : What 's the best thing you 've learned out of life ? A : All of the things I live my life by I got from my parents and my grandfather . My dad was always good for saying things like ' Keep your nose to the grindstone , be a good employee for whoever you work for or whatever you do and have it always come from the heart . ' Mom was more spiritual and she would paraphrase a Bible verse that said something like ' Let your light so shine among men that they may see your good works . ' Granddad taught me honor and how to treat every kind of person with respect . Even those who commit the most horrendous crimes have some value . Q : You have reached one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police chief of Aurora . Why do you still go out on patrols ? A : I think it is about leadership . This is my version of leading from the front , of being out there with those who you serve with and letting them know that even though I have a different job , I still respect what they do and think it 's important . It says you need to be involved , put your heart and motivation into what you do . I do n't look at police work or living life as a job . Q : How can people avoid getting into trouble with police officers ? A : Most contacts with police are initiated by some sort of traffic violation or a domestic incident . If you do n't want to be involved with an officer , pay attention to the driving laws , watch your speed and drive courteously , without drawing attention to yourself . Police are often called upon when there is a perceived conflict between citizens . When officers go out to a call people will say , ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But to a fearful and concerned neighbor , that argument could easily sound like something that 's about to erupt into violence . My advice is to keep things under control . Q : How do you get out of a ticket ? A : People always joke with me that they want my business card so that when they get pulled over , they can tell the police officer that they know me . That 's the worst thing to do . An officer may say ' I do n't like Ricky ' and you will get the ticket . If you are being stopped , it 's for a reason . If people engage the officer in an honest conversation , are very courteous and give a truthful explanation for why they were speeding , several officers will let them go with a warning . Remember , officers are peopleutoouand they understand the realities of life . Julie Aigner-Clark Aigner-Clark , 37 , is the founder of the Baby Einstein Co. , which produces multimedia products for babies and toddlers . She started the company in her basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling it to the Walt Disney Co. in 2001 . Her latest project is a line of videos , books and electronic games called ' Smart . Cool . Safe , ' designed to make the idea of safety fun . She is also a recent breast cancer survivor . 1 . Both of the things that I have done are based on my passion . I launched Baby Einstein because I was looking for something for my babies that exposed them to the arts because I was passionate about the arts . Now that my daughters are older my concerns and passions as a parent have changed . If you create something out of passion , it is so clear in the product that you make . 2 . When I first started out I needed a cheerleader , and my husband was an amazing cheerleader . I had the idea , but I needed someone to say , ' You can do it . ' Surround yourself with people who believe in you . If someone does n't believe in you say , ' Bye- bye . ' 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I make up my mind and do it . I was diagnosed with breast cancer five weeks ago on a Friday , and I had a double mastectomy 10 days later . When you first hear you have breast cancer you think it is a death sentence , but for me it was a life sentence . I look at every single thing in my life differently . Anna Jo Haynes Haynes , 69 , is best known as a pioneer in early childhood education for Denver 's low- income children . In 1965 , she was one of the first volunteers for the city 's Head Start program . She continues advocating for children and serves as executive director of Mile High Montessori Early Learning Centers. 1 . My vision is to ensure that children get the best start in life , that it is equal and fair for all . I learned that people are motivated to get things done when they are motivated through their heartstrings . Look at Mother 's Against Drunk Drivers . That was a single mother who lost her child to a drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned into something positive . 2 . I was motivated by both my mother and father who felt very strongly that you come into the world and you are here to make a difference . You need to give back . I think constantly that I need to be doing things that make a difference . 3 . If you 're considered a leader , either by choice or by chance , you have to take risks . Nothing is certain . If you wait until you have all of your adequate information you 'll never move . If we all think alike , then no one thinks very much . Shanan Longfellow Longfellow , 33 , graduated from Fort Lewis College , worked for the Smithsonian Institution and now directs her own art gallery , Sorrel Sky in Durango . Among the art she carries is the jewelry of her father , Ben Nighthorse Campbell . 1 . Follow your heart . My dad did n't get into politics until I was 12 , so I grew up with him as an artist . I remember this whole magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we lived in , and by the time I was 12 , I knew I wanted to open a gallery . I learned from Dad that your drive should start internally , which will make it easier to weather hard times , to be creative and to be innovative . 2 . You have to believe in things you ca n't see . You have to hold onto a vision of how you want things to happen , even when they are n't . The year I opened my own gallery the fires hit Colorado . It was Durango 's hardest summer . I stayed with my two aunts , who are full- blooded Cheyenne , and they taught me this lesson . 3 . Do n't take anything too seriously . Life is about lessons , and what you learn from your successes and failures . Do n't take either the highs or the lows too seriously . I learned this one on my own . I looked back five years and realized not to be scared about things because it will all work out in the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year as principal of McLain Community High School in Lakewood , the alternative <p> high school for Jefferson County Public Schools . Previously , he was principal of a similar school in Portales , N.M. , where he grew up . <p> McLain has a full-time enrollment of 738 , but serves more than 1,000 additional students through a variety of programs for at-risk youth and their families . ' Education is by nature a hopeful business and anytime this sense of hope is lost or diminished u for kids , by kids , in schools or communities u problems occur . From my daily experience I see time and again how events and conditions in individual lives , the multiple factors that portend possible future failure , overwhelm any sense of perspective regarding the enormity of life . I believe it is a temporary lack of recognition of this immensity that contributes most to an at-risk society . Myopia often leads to a loss of purpose . This loss of perspective is what I see most in my work with students and adults . Mostly our kids are intelligent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives . These challenges have set them on a different pathway , and our challenge , our obligation , is to help them find perspective and regain their bearing . I 've learned and observed there 's nothing unusual about life setting up roadblocks and , by chance or choice , causing detours . In fact , detours in life should be expected . What is unexpected though and still commonplace , is when a detour is so disorienting that all original direction , all vision is lost . I 'd say for students and adults , mission is easy to grasp u go dig a hole . Vision , though , that essential yet unseen counterpart to mission , is hard for most to comprehend . Vision puts belief into mission and purpose behind task . Vision goes beyond just sight . Vision , like true north on our moral compass , is actually hope . Go dig a hole so that you might find water to sustain not only yourself but also all of us . ' Colleen Miller Miller , 53 , is a life coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is president of the Boulder Coaches Alliance and is married to Bill Pomeroy , who is also a life coach . ' Most of us think of happiness as being possible when we are successful . From this perspective our happiness is postponed until we complete everything on our lists , and ultimately that is an impossibility . Think about the day after you die : There will still be a to-do list on your desk , which will mean you have failed . I honestly think that happiness is really a choice . When you get up in the morning , do n't focus on everything that 's got to be done today , because this creates stress right away . Instead , focus on what can give you laughter , and how you want your life to be . Life is just too short to always be unhappy . Since 9/11 we 've all become so serious that it 's adversely affecting our health . Yet we can do serious work in the world and still come from a lighter place . The people who study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulates your immune system and manufactures endorphins , which provide 10 times more potent pain relief than the equivalent amount of morphine . And there are aerobic benefits too , because laughing increases your blood-oxygen level . A hundred good belly laughs are the equivalent of 10 minutes of rowing . It 's sad that while the average 4-year-old laughs 350 to 400 times a day , by the time we reach midlife with a mortgage and kids and college loans , most of us are down to about five . We need to practice living in the present . Instead , we tend to shoot ourselves forward , anticipating all kinds of problems that will probably never occur , or we shoot backward into the past , judging ourselves unfairly for something we 've done u and both of those take us out of the present time , which is the only place we are actually alive . We focus mostly on what we do n't want , when simply focusing on what we do want can change how we feel by altering us chemically . Just think about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some event because you think it will be boring or you wo n't have any fun or somebody is going to come up and ask you for money . Now , imagine how you 'd like it to be u that you 'd meet some interesting people and it would be so delightful it would be payment and a half for being there . See how differently this might make you feel . Sure , it 's all made up . But most of what we believe about life and how the world works is made up , so you might as well make up something that serves you well . ' The Rev. Acen Phillips Phillips , 68 , is senior pastor at Mount Gilead Baptist Church in Denver , where he has served for the past 44 years . Q : What often provokes a crisis of faith ? A : Fear . Either you live by faith or fear . We fear that which we do n't know , anything that we are not clear about , things that we ca n't comprehend . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know black people so I fear them . That 's the kind of thing that only knowledge and relationships can help you overcome . Q : How can we find our life 's work ? A : Each one of us is created with a predetermined purpose , a reason for why each of us is here . God gives us the Bible so we can read the scriptures and find our purpose as we study his word . There also are some signals from God , some gifts we have automatically been blessed with like the ability to sing or write . These things become easier to accomplish because it 's a gift inside you . But once we find those things , God says we need to work worthy inside the vocation of his calling . Dr. King said , ' If I am gifted to become a street sweeper , I need to do it with the same excitement that Michelangelo painted portraits . ' When we begin to do God 's calling , everyone finds satisfaction and is a blessing not only to themselves but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to someone still searching for their spiritual center ? A : The most important thing is to find a personal relationship with Christ and adjusting ourselves to come in line with God 's image . Faith begins when we can see God in ourselves . Too often man measures himself against another man , but that breeds prejudice , segregation and discrimination .  --  ' Optimism helps me believe that yes , I can get this thing done .
