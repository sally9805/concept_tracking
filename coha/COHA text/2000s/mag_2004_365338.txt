Before 10,000 cheering military veterans in Cincinnati last week , President Bush declared he was bringing up to 70,000 U.S. troops home from bases in Europe and Asia over the coming decade . " We 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " he told the Veterans of Foreign Wars . His plan drew fire from his Democratic opponent , John Kerry , who said Bush 's plan shortchanges both U.S. allies and the war on terrorism . But strategic objections aside , the plan raises more immediate questions about those 21st century military technologies . <P> In order to whisk warriors to global hot spots in a hurry , the military is counting on its new 19-ton armored vehicle known as the Stryker . The Pentagon persuaded Congress to spend $8.7 billion on 2,096 Strykers because of their ability to be loaded into the ubiquitous C-130 cargo planes , flown to war zones , then immediately rolled down the planes ' back ramp and into combat . To convince doubters , the Army even staged a demonstration at Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11-troop crew emerged from the belly of a C-130 like toothpaste coming out of a tube . <P> But according to the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , even a stripped-down Stryker weighs 19 tons , two more than the C-130 routinely carries . And Iraq has exposed the Stryker 's shortcomings . To protect against rocket-propelled grenades , common in every war zone , the Strykers in Iraq wear a 2.5-ton cage of steel . This also makes them too large to fit aboard a C-130 . The steel cage is only a temporary fix . But the final solution  --  form-fitting armor that will be ready next year  --  weighs even more , 4.5 tons , and takes 10 hours to bolt on . That 's a long delay for a vehicle designed for rapid entry into combat . The Pentagon , while not disputing the GAO report , points out that the Stryker could be transported by ship and rail if necessary . <P>  --  By Mark Thompson                    @
