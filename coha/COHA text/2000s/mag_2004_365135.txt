Graphic novels used to be viewed as comic books  --  only bigger and more pretentious . Now that sales are booming , the medium is being embraced by artists as a hip way to tell challenging stories . The just released Birth of a Nation ( Crown ; 140 pages ) by Aaron McGruder , creator of the controversial comic strip The Boondocks , and Reginald Hudlin , director of the 1990 movie House Party , began as a movie script that used race as the centerpiece of a political satire . " By the time we realized how difficult that would be to sell in Hollywood , we had already fallen in love with the idea , and we just wanted it to exist , " McGruder says . " If you want to tell these stories where somebody 's going to see them , you 've got to find a different path . " <P> Birth of a Nation imagines what might happen if the mostly African-American residents of East St. Louis , Ill. , fed up with an electoral process that is n't working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sovereign state . Fred Fredericks , the mayor turned President of the newly named Blackland , must balance the country 's utopian initiatives ( adopting hitherto suppressed alternative-fuel technologies ) with the difficulties of life in a rogue nation ( where federal checks no longer come in ) . The satire is omnivorous , poking fun at the Bush Administration and Louis Farrakhan . <P> The book is affably illustrated by graphic novelist Kyle Baker . The comixcenti may sniff at its simple layout , but neophytes will appreciate its readability . And though it lacks the racial zings of , say , Dave Chappelle , it manages to land some clever social jabs . Hollywood is unlikely to have told this tale with more punch  --  if it told it at all .
