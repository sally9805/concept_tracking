The bookends were an idea of my Ruth , age eight , and the illustrations were made from the pair which she made herself , with now and then a helping hand from Daddy . The bookends are just the thing for Mother , or for your own room , and I know that you will find it easy to make a pair just as good as Ruth 's , when I tell you how to go about the work . The rabbits were sawed out of wood with a coping saw . The saw blade is narrow , and because it is narrow it can be turned this way and that , following curved lines as well as straight . Cutting with a coping saw is easy , and after a little practice you will be able to keep to a line like an expert . Until you can saw to a line , it is better to keep a little outside of the line , than to run the chance of cutting inside . After you have sawed the piece , you can finish up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " then smooth them with sandpaper . I have shown an outline of the rabbit in Figure 2 , of the correct dimensions so that you , too , can make a tracing of it . Then you can transfer the tracing to two pieces of wood . Basswood is very good for coping-saw work , but pine is easily sawed , too , and many other kinds of wood will do . The wood should be not thinner than 3/8 inch and not thicker than 3/4 inch . You may be able to get scraps of wood from a carpenter . When you have made the rabbit tracing , place it upon the wood so that the grain runs up and down , not from head to tail of the rabbit . Hold the tracing firmly with tacks or gummed paper , and go over the outlines carefully with a pencil . After sawing out the pieces , file and sandpaper the edges as true and smooth as you can . They should be nearly perfect , if not exactly so . The bases were cut out of sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because tinsnips are necessary , and it takes big hands to work them . If Daddy has n't tinsnips , go to a hardware store and ask someone to cut the metal , showing the diagram marked No. 3 , so they may know the size required . Have them round the outer corners , and drill three holes along the inner edge for small screws , as shown . The holes must be " countersunk , " so the screw heads will fit in them . // Screws 1/2-inch long are needed for attaching the metal to the rabbit blocks . Mark with a pencil where the plate holes come and drive the screws into the wood . Stick the screw ends into a cake of soap , to make them drive easily . The bookends were finished with paint . The rabbits were painted with three coats of white paint , the base plates with two coats of black . First , the wood was sandpapered very smooth , then after each coat of paint had dried , the surfaces were again sanded with fine sandpaper . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into each side of each head , for eyes , and a piece of felt was glued to the bottom of each base plate . Figures 4 and 5 , in the upper corner diagrams , show how the same rabbit can be made into a clever doorstop , a device which Mother probably has wished for many times , to keep an opened door from slamming . The rabbit is cut the same as for the book ends , but the base plate is longer , and two inches of its length are bent over , as shown in Figure 6 . The bent plate forms a wedge to slip under the door , as shown in Figure 5 . The rabbit doorstop may be finished , as suggested for the bookends , or in bright colors if you prefer . // <p>
