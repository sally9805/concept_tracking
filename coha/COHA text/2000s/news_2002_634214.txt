<p> EASTERN CONFERENCE <p> Bruins vs . Canadiens <p> Boston 's reign as the top seed in the East may be as short as goalie Byron Dafoe 's playoff resume . He has eight postseason wins in 21 appearances and has won just one playoff series ( in 1999 , when Dafoe , 31 , was a second-team all-star ) . For openers , Dafoe will have to out-perform red-hot Jose Theodore , Montreal 's most valuable player , who had a .931 save percentage and 2.11 goals-against average in the regular season . The Bruins have the best penalty-killing team , but are also the most-penalized squad in the league . The Canadiens made the playoffs against all odds after another injury-plagued season , but would need Theodore to be terrific to advance as they have no answer for Boston 's big guns on offense ( Bill Guerin and Joe Thornton ) . <p> Hanley 's pick : Boston in five . <p> Flyers vs . Senators <p> Philadelphia , which owned the East until the final few weeks of the season , limps into the playoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury and adding Adam Oates from Washington at the trade deadline gives the Flyers three of the top centers in the league . The team has tabbed Roman Cechmanek as the starting goalie over Brian Boucher , who was 11-7 with a 2.03 goals-against average last postseason . Bad choice . Coach Bill Barber may be out of a job if Philly fails to get to the Stanley Cup finals . Ottawa has lost 11 straight playoff games on the road and has dropped out in the first round in each of the last three postseasons . Looks like both streaks will continue here . Hanley 's pick : Philadelphia in four . <p> Hurricanes vs . Devils <p> Carolina is again the poster child for what is wrong with the league 's playoff system , which awards a top-three seed to division winners even if the division is horse hockey , like the Hurricanes ' Southeast seems to be each season . The reality is Carolina ranks 15th out of the 16 playoff teams and would not have qualified had it played in the Western Conference . Last season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare in the opening round . Carolina will miss Glen Wesley ( shoulder ) and that adds even more pressure on Ron Francis and Ron Brind'Amour . But even stellar series by those two likely will not inflate the stats of Devils goalie Martin Brodeur , who was again one of the league 's best with a 2.15 goals-against average , fourth overall . Hanley 's pick : New Jersey in five . <p> Maple Leafs vs . Islanders <p> Offense was Toronto 's trademark this season . Captain Mats Sundin led the Leafs with 41 goals and the team topped the conference with 249 . Star goalie Curtis Joseph ( 2.23 ) returned for the final two regular-season games after breaking his hand . The pressure of a Stanley Cup and impending free agency will be on Joseph , who plays behind an iffy and injury-plagued defense . The Islanders , who missed the playoffs for seven straight seasons , improved by 44 points and recently have regained the form that got them off to a fast start this season . They were 13-9-2-1 in their last 25 games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yashin , the team 's $10 million man , has been battling a groin injury of late . Oleg Kvasha has seven goals in the last 11 games . Goalie Chris Osgood has been through the Stanley Cup drill at Detroit . Hanley 's pick : New York in seven . <p> Red Wings vs . Canucks <p> With a payroll of more than $60million , Detroit was built to win the Stanley Cup this season . The Red Wings ' all-star lineup paid off for most of the season as they coasted to the best record in the league . They were second in the NHL in goals scored and third overall in goals against , thanks to the play of goalie Dominik Hasek ( 2.17 ) , who angled his way through a trade to Detroit to try to win the championship that has eluded him . The Wings ' special teams are No. 2 in the league in power-play efficiency and No. 3 in penalty-killing . The Canucks come into the postseason as hot as any team , with an 8-1-1 record in their last 10 . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may weigh more heavily on the older Wings . Hanley 's pick : Detroit in six . <p> Avalanche vs . Kings <p> The news Tuesday that Peter Forsberg has been cleared to play in the postseason boosts Colorado 's chances to repeat as Stanley Cup champs . Forsberg got the green light after rehabbing from ankle surgeries that kept him out all season . Forsberg 's presence will free up Joe Sakic , whose offensive numbers were down when his linemate was out , and it also will ease the pressure on Patrick Roy , who was again the league 's best goalie and carried the Avs through some tough times . Roy was the reason Colorado had the league 's best defense , allowing 18 fewer goals than Detroit . Los Angeles surged into the thick of the wild West 's playoff race on the power of its special teams ( first in power play and third in penalty-killing ) . Felix Potvin has been solid in goal and , thanks to one of the best No. 1 lines in the West ( Jason Allison , Ziggy Palffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season on a 13-7-3-1 run . <p> Hanley 's pick : Colorado in six . <p> Sharks vs . Coyotes <p> After the Olympic break , Phoenix finished with a 15-5-1-2 record , best in the West . As good as goalie Sean Burke has been  --  and he is an MVP candidate after a 33-21-6 and 2.29 goals-against campaign  --  his history in the postseason shows just two wins since he entered the NHL in 1987 . The franchise has not won a playoff series in 15 years . Still , this is a young and resilient team that wowed the West without Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick this season . Phoenix sports five 20-goal scorers . San Jose has enough depth and good goaltending to make things interesting for odds-on favorites Detroit and Colorado . The Sharks are as physical a team as can be found in this postseason , thanks to captain Owen Nolan , Mike Ricci and Scott Thornton , to name a few feisty forwards . Coach Darryl Sutter 's squad should be able to muscle its way through two rounds at the least . Hanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs . Blackhawks <p> The Hawks have to get healthy in a hurry if they expect to beat the Blues in what will be one of the best-contested of the opening series . If defensemen Boris Mironov ( groin ) and Alex Karpovtsev ( knee ) can not play , coach Brian Sutter will have to find another way to out-physical the red-hot Blues , who were 8-2 in their last 10 games . Despite all the talk of an underachieving season , St. Louis finished with the same number of wins ( 43 ) as last year and just five fewer points . The biggest question for both teams is goaltending . The Hawks have been rotating between Jocelyn Thibault , who set a career high for wins ( 33 ) , and backup Steve Passmore , who was on a much better roll as the season ended . Thibault is the likely postseason starter and figures to square off against the Blues ' Brent Johnson , who had 34 wins in 58 appearances . The only statistic that supports the Hawks taking this series is their 3-1-1 mark against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . Hanley 's pick : Hawks in seven . <p> EAST : Flyers vs . Islanders <p> Since Philadelphia is supposed to be here and the Islanders are not , the Flyers may feel a lot more pressure . Philly 's firepower gives it the edge in what will be a high-scoring series . Hanley 's pick : Philadelphia in six . <p> WEST : Red Wings vs . Avalanche <p> Something says Detroit took too much for granted the last few weeks and may have trouble restarting the mojo they rode to the top of the league this season . Hasek has had his troubles of late . That should not be much of a problem in the first two rounds , but by the time they get to Denver , they wo n't be rising . <p> Hanley 's pick : Colorado in six . <p> Flyers vs . Avalanche <p> Colorado can capture its second consecutive championship even if Forsberg does not stay healthy through the postseason , as long as Roy does . <p> Hanley 's pick : Colorado in six .
