On June tenth , I turned ten . The Saturday after my birthday , the eye blinking and popping began . We were eating breakfast . Matanni was sitting across from me ; Patanni was at the head of the table . To this day , I can remember my first urge -- so intense it was , like an itch needing to be scratched . I could feel little invisible rubber bands fastened to my eyelids , pulled tight through my brain , and attached to the back of my head . Every few seconds , a crank behind my skull turned slowly . With each turn , the rubber bands yanked harder , and the space inside my head grew smaller . My grandmother was studying me , making sure my face had been washed , my hair combed and fastened on each side with the blue barrettes she had bought me for my birthday . While Matanni studied me , I stared straight ahead and glued my eyes , growing tighter with each second , on the brown fuzz above her lip . " Icy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you staring at ? " " Them hairs above your lip , " I blurted , extending my arm and pointing at her face . " They 're turning gray , " I said , jiggling my arm at her nose , " right there . " Patanni , spooning sugar over his oatmeal , snatched up his head and turned toward me . " Calling attention to a person 's weakness ai n't nice , " he said . " B-but Patanni ... " I stammered , aware only of the pressure squeezing my head and the space inside it constricting . My grandfather laid his spoon beside his bowl . " Apologize , Icy , " he demanded . " Tell Matanni you 're sorry . " " But Virgil ... " My grandmother reached out and caught his hand in hers . " What the child said ai n't so bad . If them hairs turn gray , they wo n't stand out . Gray is almost white , Virgil , and white matches my skin . " She smiled , caressing the top of his hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , releasing his hand , stroking her upper lip . Patanni pushed back his chair ; the legs scraped against the blue-checked linoleum rug . " That ai n't the point , Tillie , " he said . " Icy , here , made mention of your weakness like it were n't nothing . " " She 's just a child , " my grandmother said . " But it ai n't respectful , " he said . " She meant no harm , " Matanni assured him . " Icy , what do you say ? " Patanni insisted , leaning toward me . " ' Tai n't necessary , " my grandmother said , sitting on the edge of her chair , her large breasts weaving over her bowl . " Icy ! " Patanni ordered . " Icy ! " Matanni shot back , looking straight into my eyes . " Icy ! " he began again . " Icy ! " she repeated . I jumped up . " There ai n't no fuzz on you ! " I hollered , feeling the rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body pooling behind my eyes , pushing them forward , so far forward that I could stand it no longer , not a moment longer , and , hopping up and down , I bellowed again , " Fuzz is on my eyeballs . It itches my eyes ! " Frantically , I wiggled my fingers in front of my face . " They itch ! " I screamed , fluttering my fingertips . " They itch ! " Then , unable to close my eyelids or scratch my eyes , I covered my face with my palms and inhaled deeply , hoping that the itchiness and tightness would go away ; but instead I felt my eyelids , rolling up further like shades snapping open , and my eyeballs , rolling back like two turtles ducking inside their shells , and the space inside my head , shrinking smaller and smaller until only a few thoughts could fit inside ; and , terrified of the contraction , of each thought 's strangulation , I threw back my head and cried , " Baby Jesus ! Sweet Jesus ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop it , I gave in completely to the urge : Out popped my eyes , like ice cubes leaping from a tray . Patanni and Matanni just sat there and watched my eyes spring from my head , but a minute later both pretended that everything had passed like it always did each morning . Matanni drank four cups of her mud-black coffee with a squirt of Essie 's cream . Patanni finished his one cup , black with six tablespoons of sugar , and I drank my milk . All of us ate our oatmeal . I ladled honey on mine . Patanni preferred sugar . Matanni ate hers unadorned . No one resurrected Matanni 's mustache . That one big pop had unleashed all of the tension , and the space inside my head grew large again , plumped up with thoughts . We ate in silence , and I sat calmly , as though nothing had happened . Still , after that Saturday morning , during the summer of 1956 , the urges claimed me . I was no longer Icy Sparks from Poplar Holler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm -- our sixty-acre homestead , replete with two milk cows , a dozen chickens , and Big Fat , the five-hundred-pound sow . I was now a little girl who had to keep all of her compulsions inside . Whenever it became too much , after hours of hoarding blinkings and poppings that threatened to burst out in a thousand grotesque movements , I 'd offer to get Matanni a jar of green beans from the root cellar , a pantry-sized room dug from a hill not twenty feet from the back door ; and , once inside , I 'd close the wooden planked door and let loose . Every blink that had been stored up spilled forth . Every jerk that had been contained leaped out . For ten minutes , I 'd contort until the anxiety was all spent . Then I 'd climb up on the footstool and grab the Mason jar . With canned beans in hand , heading toward the house , I thought , Secrets are evil , and wondered what secrets my grandparents kept hidden . I listened to the crickets sing . Covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; chirping , they gave their secrets away . A wildcat cried , mourning over something forbidden . Down a dirt road cradled between two gnarled , unfriendly mountains , Poplar Holler guarded its mysteries . So far , mine were hidden in a root cellar . Clitus Stewart 's were tucked beneath his mattress . Mamie Tillman would throw hers into Little Turtle Pond . Everyone in Poplar Holler had secrets , even the animals , but I -- Icy Sparks -- knew that mine were the worst . CHAPTER TWO If I could catch a ride into town , I went to the movies whenever I could . Immersed in celluloid fantasies , I became a rugged , square-jawed pioneer with a rifle , protecting my land , shooting bloodthirsty Comanches , or I was Running Deer , a Navajo Indian maiden , sitting cross-legged in front of a fire , cradling a baby in my arms . I became Shirley Temple , tap-dancing across the floor , or Joan Crawford , mysterious and dark , scheming for money , plotting out murder . As I sat in the second row of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Even Ginseng 's Jeanette Owens in her wheelchair seemed luckier than I was . At least the townsfolk pitied her . They thought her brave , rolling through life , a sour grin plastered over her face . Lonnie Spikes , a twenty-year-old simpleton , elicited clucking sounds and slow , pendulous swings of the head . " Poor thing , " the townsfolk said . " He ai n't got no idea . ' T is a blessing . " Each citizen slackened his pace to let Lonnie stumble by . He 'd amble toward the Ginseng Post Office , where he 'd sit for hours on the outside steps with his pants unzipped , his tongue lolling from his mouth , his eyes enameled over like those of a corpse . Clutching a Coke in one hand and a box of Milk Duds in the other , I scrunched back into the brown leather seat , my feet nervously rapping the floor , and waited for Coyote Sunrise to begin . The lights blinked three times , Joel McRoy , slouched in the chair behind me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icy Sparks ai n't nobody 's girlfriend . " " Wino cares ? " I answered , swallowing some Coke and munching ice . " Peary Lawson does , " Joel said . " He likes you . " I twisted around and glared at him . " I 'm only ten , " I snarled . " I do n't like boys . " " You ought to like him , " Joel said . " How come ? " I snapped , tossing back my head , flicking a Milk Dud into my mouth . " ' Cause he has frog eyes like you . " Joel held on to a Chilly Dilly , a long green dill pickle sold at the candy counter . I slammed the Coke and Milk Duds down on the armrests , one on each side , and jumped up . " You polecat of a dog ! " I did n't know if those words meant anything nasty , but I liked the sound of them . " You big fat liar ! " " Your eyes pop out like a frog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baton . " They do n't , " I said . " They do , too , " Joel said , thrusting the Chilly Dilly in my direction . " Liar , liar , pants on fire ! " I screamed , losing all composure , pointing my fist at his pickle . " Shush ! " came a voice from a few rows back . " I seen you , Icy Sparks . I seen you behind Old Man Potter 's barn . " " You seen what ? " I demanded . " Polecats stink . They ai n't able to see . " Joel McRoy rose to his feet , swung his hand upward , and angrily crunched . One-half of the Chilly Dilly disappeared into his mouth . " I ... seen you ... " he said between bites , chomping down dill pickle like it was an ear of sweet corn , " jer ... king , pop ... ping them frog ... eyes of yours ... behind Old Man Pot ... ter 's barn . " " You slimy ole pickle ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frog eyes ! Frog eyes ! Frog eyes ! " Joel screamed back . " Be quiet , you two ! " someone warned . " Liar ! Liar ! Liar ! " I yelled , ignoring the warning , then grabbed my cup of Coke , rocked up on my toes , leaned over , and poured the whole drink , ice and all , over Joel 's head . Stunned , he just stood there , a green chunk of Chilly Dilly inside his mouth , swelling out his check , a half-eaten pickle gripped in his hand . " You ai n't seen nothing ! You just tell lies ! " And with these final words , I marched out -- knowing full well that Joel McRoy was telling the truth , that the week before when I was out playing tag with him and his cousin , Janie Lou , the urges had gotten really bad , and I had stolen away behind Old Man Potter 's barn and let loose such a string of jerks and eye pops that the ground behind the barn seemed to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but -- in the space of ten minutes -- I had also become a full-fledged liar . That afternoon , after leaving Darley Theater , I whiled away my nerves and guilt roaming the hilly , winding streets of Ginseng . I passed by the Crockett County Courthouse , the center of town . Farmers in bib overalls were scattered along the brick walkway that led to its four skinny white columns . Red geraniums bloomed on either side of the walkway leading to the entrance graced by a Kentucky flag and a U.S. flag . I continued east on Main Street , walking by the post office only two buildings down , but saw no one sitting out front on its dusty white steps . Adjacent to the post office was the Samson Coal Company -- its offices located in a two-story , red brick building . Next came People 's Bank , a gray , quarry-stoned building constructed during the 1920s . Three buildings down from the bank on the other side of the street was the Darley Theater , a crimson brick movie house with a marquee in front , where I had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there ; so , instead , I abruptly cut across the street and headed down a steep sidewalk toward the Cut ' n Curl , which was tucked into a corner of Short Street . When I arrived , I said hello to Mrs. Matson , the proprietor -- a tall , large-boned woman who wore her orange-red hair in tight , short curls -- and helped sweep up strands of hair around the chairs and beside the sinks . After I folded towels , picked up scattered magazines , and cleaned the toilet , she gave me a bottle of Coke , so cold that ice clung to the glass while an iceberg floated inside . I sipped the drink slowly , sucking the ice between my lips , feeling my teeth ache from the cold . Yet all the while , my thoughts were fixed on Old Man Potter 's barn . Behind a mound of hay , I had popped and jerked like a caught fish lighting . I had done it all -- twisted , contorted , and misshaped my body into a thousand unsightly knots ; and Janie Lou and Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shuddered . " Mrs. Matson , what can I do now ? " I asked as she took the bottle from my hands . " You can get along , " she said . " Go find some kids and play . " " But , " I argued , " they 're at the movies . " " Not all of them , Icy Sparks . Scat , now ! " she said , clapping her hands . " It ai n't healthy for a youngin ' to sit around grown folk all day . " " But --  " I persisted . " But , nothing , " she said . " Go outside and play . " Through the glass door , I saw the sunlit streets of Ginseng with its buildings traced in gray , coal 's bold signature . Ginseng had always been prosperous . Through coal 's boom and bust , it liked to brag on itself . It bragged about Samson Coal and the contracts that kept its miners working even during hard times . It bragged about young Dr. Stone and his brand-new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car accidents , miners with black lung , and sick folk who did n't have to travel all the way to Lexington for treatment anymore . It bragged about being the county seat , about having a movie theater and decent schools . It bragged , bragged , and bragged , all the while averting its eyes from the nooks and crannies deep in the hills where life could be hard , where good and bad times depended upon the price of coal and the future plans of the coal companies . Pressing my hands against the glass , I stared at Ginseng Full Gospel Baptist Church , stuck between Willena 's Cafe and Dr. Stone 's new office , and spotted the Church of the Nazarene , inserted in the tiny space behind Schooler 's Funeral Home . In town there was no root cellar in which to hide , no shadows to eclipse my fears . The many churches , squeezed into corners , offered little refuge . They were for righteous , truthful people . As I twisted the doorknob , turning around to wave good-bye , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's warmth burned through the glass and caressed my skin , I knew that Miss Emily would not betray me . Although lately I was too scared to trust anyone , I knew that the child inside her would not turn on me if she caught me jerking . Had n't her soft , fat arms always sheltered me and kept me warm ? Long before I met Miss Emily , I had heard about her strangeness . At Comb 's Restaurant on the river , I had heard the townsfolk gossiping . " She comes by it naturally , " they 'd say . " Both her parents were fat . Huge tubs of lard . " At Margaret 's Bakery , I had listened to housewives whispering in superior voices , " She buys three dozen sweet rolls every morning and eats all of them at once . " The men at the barbershop snickered and said , " No God-fearing man will marry Miss Emily . If she took to hugging him , he 'd be squashed . " Women at Stoddard 's Five and Dime milled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said , " They do n't make panties big enough to cover Miss Emily 's broad behind . " Then they 'd giggle , cup their hands over their mouths , their eyes darting from side to side , and feel pleased with themselves and the unanimity of their attack . At six , I had n't understood everything I 'd heard , but I had understood the sound of disdain and knew it was mean . In spite of this , I had n't connected such meanness to the people expressing it , but rather to the one at whom it was directed . So when Patanni first took me to Tanner 's Feed Supply and asked me to come inside and meet a really nice woman -- Miss Emily Tanner -- I hail been afraid . She was in the backroom sorting out corn feed as we had walked through the door . When the bell above the doorway jangled , I had jumped back . " Patanni , " I whined , my toes trembling inside my shoes , " I do n't want to . Ca n't I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Icy , " he said , grabbing my hand and pulling me forward . " I brought you over to meet Miss Emily and you 're gon na do just that . " " What if she do n't like me ? " I said , straining in the opposite direction . " I 'll be coming directly , " a voice rang out . " I 'm shoveling corn . " " What if she do n't like me ? " I repeated , leaning so far toward the door that my grandfather 's fingers popped . " Doggone it , Icy ! " Patanni barked . " Straighten up . The woman ai n't no witch . " " But she 's fat . Her bottom do n't fit inside regular underwear . " " So ? " my grandfather said . " What does her bottom have to do with her heart ? " " She cats three dozen sweet rolls every morning , " I spewed out . " She 's too fat . She could crush a person if she hugged her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't crushed nobody . " " But --  " I pleaded . " Shush ! " Patanni cut in , holding a finger up to his lips . " Mind your manners . " From the back of the store , I heard wood scraping along a floor and heavy breathing . Suddenly Miss Emily laughed loudly . " What she laughing about ? " I asked , tightly squeezing Patanni 's hand . " Ai n't nobody back there with her . " " Maybe she enjoys her own company , " my grandfather said . I swallowed hard and nodded . " Maybe she 's a nice woman who likes to laugh . " " Yessir , " I peeped . " Maybe --  " my grandfather went on , but stopped short when he saw Emily Tanner , red-faced and sweating , emerge from the backroom . " Hello , Miss Emily , " he said , extending his hand . Ignoring my grandfather 's hand , she grinned broadly and said , " Mr. Virgil , I 'm gon na hug you instead . " Then she lunged toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasped him ferociously to her chest . I heard my grandfather groan , saw his head buried in her blue plaid cotton dress , and her face , all bunched up and creased with fat . My heart raced . My palms began to sweat . I could see myself suffocating in Miss Emily 's quicksand of blubber , and I stammered , " Not me , oh no you do n't ! " Releasing his hand , I inched toward the door and threatened , " You ai n't gon na squeeze the life out of me . You ai n't gon na squash me . " Quickly , I pivoted on my toes and ran . " I 'm gon na hug you , too ! " Miss Emily squealed , chasing after me , her flesh crawling forward like a blue-stained snowdrift . And before I realized it , she had snatched my shirt and was pulling me toward her , right into her rotund arms . But instead of moaning from pain , I had groaned from pure delight , cognizant only of her sweet warmth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of coal dust tingling in my nose , I headed for Walnut Street , one of the inclines that zigzagged up and down both sides of the courthouse square , passing by Margaret 's Bakery , Stoddard 's Five and Dime , Denton 's Barber Shop , and Danny 's Filling Station , to spend the rest of the afternoon in Tanner 's Feed Supply . " Howdy , Miss Emily , " I said as I creaked open the screen door , my hand springing up , my fingers fluttering hello . " Howdy , Icy Gal , " she said from the back of the store . Then she turned around from the wire rack where she was arranging packets of seed and held out her arms , so fleshy that the fat flapped to and fro when she moved them . " I been missing you , " I said , throwing my body into those hamhocks , nestling my head between her huge breasts . " I been missing you , " I repeated , closing my frog eyes , feeling the tension seep out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where have you been ? " She combed my curls with her lingers . " I have n't seen you , in weeks . " " Around , " I mumbled , my mouth engulfed in gingham . " You know how I miss you when you do n't visit , " she said , placing her square hands on either side of my head , rocking me back , and staring into my eyes . " But I knew you were coming today . Johnny Cake told me you were in town . " " I saw him at the Cut ' n Curl , " I said . " He was filling up the Coke machine . I 'm sorry I ai n't ... " Then , lowering my eyes , I coughed and corrected myself . " I mean , I 'm sorry I have n't seen you in so long . " " Do n't feel badly , Icy Gal , " she said . She took my hand , and flesh -- like warm dough rising -- cushioned my fingers . " I 've got something for you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled broadly ; her thin lips , a pencil stroke , slit her face . " A coffee cake ? " I asked , knowing full well what Miss Emily had prepared for me . " No , " she said , shaking her head from side to side , her reddish brown hair stroking her chin . " A peppermint stick ? " I ventured . " Certainly not , " she said , and squeezed my hand . " Seems to me after all these years you 'd be smart enough to guess what I have for you . " I shrugged my shoulders . " I 'm tuckered out from guessing , " I said . " I just want to be surprised . " " Get ready . Get set ! " she said , still holding my hand . " Go , Icy Gal ! " All three hundred pounds of her pulled me through a doorway from which hung a blue velvet curtain . " Now close your eyes , " she ordered , trudging forward as I trailed behind . " Okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As always , teacups , saucers , plates , and miniature silverware were laid out on a small , rectangular table covered with a yellow , pinstriped cloth . " ' T is wonderful ! " I exclaimed , clapping my hands . In the center of the table was a cobalt-blue platter decorated with teacakes , a bowl of sugar cubes , a pitcher of cream , a saucer of lemon slices , and a silver bowl heaped high with taffy . At one end of the table in a doll-sized wicker chair sat Mrs. Possum , a string of baby possums attached to her stomach . At the other end , Gigi , the half-French and half-Persian stuffed cat , was propped upon a leather stool . Miss Emily lowered herself onto a huge wooden bench on one side of the table while I sat down in a diminutive Queen Anne chair covered in gold satin . " I never would have guessed , " I lied . " Oh , never ! " Miss Emily giggled . " But what 's different ? " she asked . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then said , " The sugar cubes . We 've never had sugar cubes before . " " So right you are , Icy Gal ! " Miss Emily said . " So right you are ! " She leaned over and removed the tea cozy . " You could n't have timed it better , " she said . " Just a few minutes ago , I put the kettle on to boil . Would you like some tea ? " she asked politely . " Yes , ma'am . " I nodded and lifted my teacup . Miss Emily poured a stream of tea into my cup , then some into hers . " Sugar and cream or lemon anti sugar ? " she asked . " Lemon and sugar , " I said as she handed me the bowl of sugar cubes anti the saucer of lemon slices . " A tea cake ? " she asked , arching her eyebrows . " Of course , " I said . " Mind if I do n't ? " she said . " I 'm watching my figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Possum , would you care for a cup of tea ? " she asked , turning her head in the possum 's direction . " A cup of cream only , " Mrs. Possum said in a high-pitched voice . " I do n't imbibe in caffeine when I 'm nursing . And three tea cakes -- please -- that is , if you 've enough . " " Cream is good for a nursing mother , " Miss Emily explained , looking at me . " That 's what Miss Gigi said , " I answered , staring back at her , trying to trick and confuse her , wanting to catch her when she threw her voice . " Miss Gigi ? " Miss Emily said , suddenly twisting her neck . " Would you like a cup of tea ? After all , you 're not a nursing mother . " " Oui , oui , " Miss Gigi purred . " I adore the full-flavored taste of tea , with just a hint of lemon . " Speaking with a thick French accent , in a smug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , especially babies . " " A tea cake ? " Miss Emily asked , reaching over , holding up the tray . " See this slim figure ? " Miss Gigi hummed . " I did n't get it from eating three tea cakes . " " So what ? " Mrs. Possum snarled from the other end of the table . " You got only your prissy body , no man and no kids . " " No babies stealing my strength , " Miss Gigi seethed . " No babies leeching from my belly . " " Babies do n't leech ! " Mrs. Possum growled . " Babies suckle down nourishment . " " Your babies leech , " Miss Gigi shot back . " They 're parasites , drinking down the vermin you eat . " " I 'm warning you ! " Mrs. Possum screamed . " Shut that arrogant French trap of yours or I 'll ... " " You 'll what ? " Miss Gigi said softly . " Use your brats as switches and whip me till I 'm quiet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sniping , " she commanded . " This is a tea party , not a prizefight . " Then , leaning over the table , she asked , " Icy Gal , do you like the tea cakes ? " I nodded , bit into my fourth , and -- with a full mouth -- said , " Especially these little black things . " " Poppy seeds , " Miss Emily explained . " They 're little poppy seeds . " Picking one from off my lip , I stared at it on my finger and praised , " They sure are good , " as I licked it off . Miss Emily smiled , stretched herself for over the table , and raised up the silver bowl piled high with taffy . " My piece de resistance , " she announced . " Icy Gal , will you join me ? " My grin traveled the width of my face . Wanting Miss Emily to see it , I held it until she set the bowl down . Then , not saying a word , I grabbed a handful of pull candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothed it out , and delicately placed the other end between Miss Emily 's thin lips . Simultaneously , we both leaned back and watched the taffy grow into a lean , flexible cord connecting the two of us . After which we slowly ate our way forward , coming closer and closer , biting off mouthfuls until we touched noses . Our eyes met , declared love , and we both clamped down , breaking the cord , and swallowed our lumps of taffy . And although I had not mentioned a word about the jerks and eye pops , I understood , right then and there , that in her heart Miss Emily knew . She was simply waiting for me to tell her .
