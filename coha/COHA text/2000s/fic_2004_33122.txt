Chapter One Mr Fogarty 's house was at the end of a short cul-de-sac . The front windows were partly boarded up , which gave it a deserted , derelict appearance . But Henry knew they 'd been boarded up while Mr Fogarty still lived there , so the neighbours would n't notice any difference . And nobody with any sense would try to visit him . Mr Fogarty had broken his last visitor 's arm with a cricket bat . Henry had a full set of keys , but he avoided using the front door and walked around the back . It was gloomy there as always - Mr Fogarty had erected an enormously high fence to stop the neighbours spying on him - and there was n't much to see : just a grey , mossy patch of lawn and the garden shed beside the buddleia bush where Henry had first met Pyrgus . He walked down to the bush - it was one of Hodge 's favourite haunts - and called out , ' Hodge ! Come on Hodgie , suppertime ! ' Hodge must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , tail up , and polished Henry 's ankle . ' Hello , Hodge , ' said Henry fondly . He sort of liked the old tomcat , even though he 'd made the place a killing field for rats , mice , birds and rabbits . Henry walked towards the back door , taking slow , careful steps on account of Hodge making figures of eight between his feet . When he unlocked the door and pushed it open , Hodge ran in ahead of him , eager for his pouch of Whiskas . Mr Fogarty had always fed him some foul-smelling stuff that looked like puke and cost less than 25p a tin . Hodge ate it under protest , but liked pouch Whiskas better . He 'd never smooched Mr Fogarty the way he smooched Henry . Henry opened the cupboard , took out two pouches and Hodge 's special tin plate . ' You 're ruining that cat - you know that , ' a voice growled from the shadows . Henry was so startled he dropped the plate , which clattered loudly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Chapter Two ' Scaredy-cat ! ' sniffed Her Serene Highness , Princess Holly Blue . ' I 'm not a scaredy-cat ! ' Pyrgus protested . ' I just want to see exactly what he 'll be doing . ' He leafed ostentatiously through the pattern book . Lavish animation spells caused the butterfly illustrations to writhe and stretch their wings . ' You know exactly what he 'll be doing , ' Blue said fiercely . ' They 're traditional designs - they have n't changed in years ! And you saw them often enough on Daddy . ' Her eyes clouded . ' While he was alive . ' ' I know , I know , ' said Pyrgus . He turned another page . ' Well , what are you waiting for ? ' Pyrgus mumbled something under his breath . ' What ? ' asked Blue sharply . ' Do n't like needles , ' Pyrgus mumbled just a little louder . They were in the Emperor 's private quarters - Pyrgus 's private quarters now - in the Purple Palace . The Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I know you do n't like needles , ' Blue said , not unkindly . ' But you have to have it done . And you have to have it done now , otherwise they 'll still be itching at your Coronation . You ca n't have the new Purple Emperor scratching through the ceremony - people will think you have fleas . ' ' I could use a healing spell , ' Pyrgus said . ' You could pull yourself together , ' Blue told him shortly . ' You 've sent that poor man away twice already . Just grit your teeth and get it over with . ' ' Oh , all right , ' Pyrgus said with bad grace . He nodded to the footman standing like a statue by the door . ' Show him in . ' The footman swung the door open with a flourish . ' Sir Archibald Buff-Arches , ' he announced loudly . ' The Royal Herticord . ' The man who strode in reminded Blue a little of her old enemy Jasper Chalkhill . He was overweight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short-silk robe woven with illusion spells so that misty nymphs swam through its folds . But that 's where the resemblance ended . His eyes showed he was no Faerie of the Night , and he walked with purpose . Two wiry helpers manoeuvred in a trolley spread with multi-coloured pots , several bottles and a tray that displayed Pyrgus 's dreaded needles . The Herticord bowed formally to Pyrgus . ' Your Imperial Majesty , ' he acknowledged . He turned to Blue and made a lesser bow . ' Your Serene Highness . ' She noticed he had very delicate hands . They were rather beautiful . ' My brother 's ready for you , ' Blue said quickly before Pyrgus could change his mind . Pyrgus gave her a dirty look , but had obviously decided to go through with it . He turned to Buff-Arches with exaggerated dignity . ' I 'm in your hands , Herticord . Let 's get it over with . ' The two helpers were busying themselves opening jars and bottles and laying out a range of gleaming instruments beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trolley looked as if they were preparing for major surgery . ' I expect His Majesty would like to know his options , ' Buff-Arches said briskly . Pyrgus stared at him and Blue 's instincts told her that if her brother was going to chicken out at all , this would be the moment . But all he said was , ' Options ? ' Yse , I 'd like to know my options . ' ' Traditionally , ' said Buff-Arches , ' the tattoos are done without anaesthetic or magical intervention of any sort , save for a small transfusion should royal blood loss exceed two pints in any single hour - ' ' Blood loss ? ' Pyrgus squeaked . ' Two pints an hour ? ' ' Oh , it seldom reaches anything approaching that amount , ' Buff- Arches said easily . ' Unless , of course , one happens to sever an artery when preparing the Royal Transposition . ' ' The Royal Transposition ? ' Pyrgus echoed . Blue moved nonchalantly a little closer in case he fainted . ' A deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A safety precaution in case of allergic response . I tattoo the sample first - with a picture of a bee - then , if there is no reaction , we proceed with the formal illustration of Your Majesty 's body . The tissue sample is normally taken from the royal buttocks . ' Blue fully expected Pyrgus to protest . She certainly would have - a tissue sample of that sort meant you could n't sit down for a week . But all Pyrgus said was , ' Why a bee ? Why do you tattoo the sample with a bee ? ' ' I have n't the slightest idea , ' Buff-Arches said . ' It 's simply the specified picture - specified by tradition , you understand . ' He watched Pyrgus for a moment , as if expecting further questions , then said abruptly , ' But I was explaining your options . As I say , the traditional way involves no anaesthetic or magical intervention , but one of your illustrious ancestors , Emperor Scolitandes the Weedy , decreed henceforth all Purple Emperors might elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local anaesthetic - ' he gestured towards some bottles on the trolley , ' - these herbal tinctures here . Or , alternatively , that the candidate might light a spell cone that would render him temporarily immune to pain . ' He paused expectantly , then added , ' Perhaps you Imperial Majesty would care to tell me the potion of his choice ? ' Pyrgus was staring at the tray . ' what are those instruments for ? ' he asked . ' The tissue sample ? ' ' Oh no , sire . Your Majesty will recall that my secondary duty as Herticord is to shave Your Majesty 's head in the Royal Tonsure . The tools look a little off-putting , but that part if the procedure is quite painless , I assure you . Unless Your Majesty has a twitch , of course . ' ' Do we have to do the shaving thing ? ' Pyrgus asked . He was a bit vain about his hair . Buff-Arches nodded briefly . ' Yes , we do . Your Majesty is titular had of the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if Your Majesty wishes , I can retain the shaven hair and have it made into a little wig for Your Majesty to wear when he is not engaged in State occasions . ' ' Yes , ' Pyrgus said quickly . ' Yes , you do that . ' ' And Your Majesty 's options ? The anaesthetics , the spell cone ... ? ' What did my father do ? ' Pyrgus asked . For the first time Buff-Archers 's expression softened . ' Your father , sire , opted for the traditional approach - no spells , no anaesthetics . He did n't even require my assistants to hold him down . ' Blue felt herself tense . It was only weeks since their father was murdered - and murdered horribly with an analogue World weapon that had destroyed most of his face . But Pyrgus and their father had seldom seen eye to eye . It had got so bad at one stage that Pyrgus had left home and lived in the city as a commoner . Would he follow his father 's example now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyrgus grandly . He began to unbutton his breeches . Blue left discreetly . She was proud of her brother , delighted with his choice . But she had no desire to be there when they took the tissue sample from his bottom . There were still a million things to do before the Coronation . Gold leaf for the Cathedral , spell candles for the nave , gifts for the congregation , musicians , the celebratory games , rabbits for the Official Distribution , the Honour Guard , the clerical bribes , the State Barge , the seven conjuration troupes , the Endolg Chorus , the Male Companion - Pyrgus wanted Henry for that and Blue was n't even sure Gatekeeper Fogarty had contacted him yet - the Female Companion , which would be Blue herself , except she still had n't had her fitting for the dress , the Grand Salute , the new statue in the Great Square , the reception menu ... the list went on and on . And all of it was down to Blue since Pyrgus would n't take it seriously . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list when she decided on impulse to get the fitting over with . She turned down a steep flight of narrow stairs that led to the servants ' quarters . It was n't an area of the palace she normally visited - when the Princess Royal needed something , servants came to her - but tradition had it that the gown worn by the Female Companion should be woven from the finest spinner silk with no spell reinforcement . Ridiculous , but that was tradition for you . Everybody knew spinner silk was the most fragile substance in the world until it set . Afterwards , of course , it was the strongest . The trouble was , to get the astonishing form-fitting folds that made spinner dresses so desirable , you had to try the garment on before the fabric set . You had to try it on carefully . At least , you had to try it on carefully when you were n't allowed to use a stasis spell . If you were lucky , the whole thing did n't fall apart and you had the most wonderful gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silk Mistresses made up another one ( at hideous expense ) and the whole process began again . Most clients , even nobles , visited the Mistresses in their trading lodges above the spinner pits . It was only by a very special concession to the Princess Royal that her Coronation gown was being constructed in the Palace itself . Blue would have been happy to give the Mistress a state apartment , but they insisted on setting up their workshop in the servants ' quarters . Blue discovered the reason when she entered it . ' Why 's it so cold in here ? ' she demanded , her breath frosting . One of the Silk Mistresses glanced up from her bench . If she was impressed by the sudden appearance of the Princess Royal , she did n't show it . ' The fabric is unworkable at higher temperatures ' she said . Blue shivered and hugged herself . ' I 've come for the fitting , ' she said shortly . ' Is everything ready ? ' The Mistress stood up and walked towards her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own gown was divine . That was the great thing about spinner silk . It made any woman look wonderful ; any woman who could afford it , that was . ' Of course , Serenity . Please follow me . ' Blue allowed herself to be led across the workshop . The Mistresses had moved their entire operation into the palace , to judge from the garments they were creating . Blue hoped they had n't moved their spinners in as well . She like arachnids - she even owned an illegal psychotronic - but silk spiders were the size of terriers , too large even for her . The Mistress opened a door to a second room , smaller than the first and empty of workbenches . There was a stunning purple and gold gown draped over a wooden form and illuminated by a gently glowglobe . The fabric shimmered as if enchanted . Despite herself , Blue sucked in her breath . It 's amazing . ' The Mistress smiled lightly . ' Indeed , Serenity . ' On impulse Blue said , ' What 's your names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' It 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen , Peach Blossom , ' Blue said sincerely . She took a step closer to the garment . Although the temperature of this room was perhaps a degree or two higher than that in the workshop , her breath was still frosting . ' Do I have to undress to try it on ? ' ' Yes , Serenity . It will fit , of course , but your body heat will set the material to conform to your figure now and forever . Assuming you do n't tear it as you put it on . ' ' I 'll be careful , ' Blue promised . The material felt ... elusive . Not quite slippery , yet somehow distant , as if it belonged in another dimension . Blue desperately wanted to put it on quickly - the room was so cold she was already shivering - but forced her numbing fingers to move with slow deliberation . The gown slid over her head and down her body like a slick of perfumed oil . She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinner threads began to set . ' Well , done , Serenity ! ' Peach Blossom said . ' You may move now - it 's quite safe . ' Blue moved and the gown moved with her . She was suddenly energised , as if someone had lit a euphira cone . ' You look wonderful , Your Highness , ' Peach Blossom said . ' Please come through and show the other Mistresses . ' Although Blue had never thought much about her appearance , she thought about it now . She felt graceful . She felt beautiful . She felt as elegant as the Silk Mistress herself . Her movements were a dance . No wonder the Mistresses could command such high prices for their designs : the effect of wearing one was quite extraordinary . There was a burst of spontaneous applause as she walked back into the workroom . Several of the Silk Mistresses even stood up , smiling their delight . Blue smiled back in sincere appreciation , but at that moment of triumph an unexpected thought occurred : just wait until Henry Atherton sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
