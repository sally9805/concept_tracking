DESTINY 'S WAY Chapter One As she sat in the chair that was hers by right of death , she raised her eyes to the cold faraway stars . Checklists buzzed distantly in her mind and her hands moved over the controls , but her thoughts flew elsewhere , amid the chill infinitude . Searching . . . Nothing . Her gaze fell and there she saw , on the controls at the adjacent pilot 's seat , her husband 's hands . She drew comfort from the sight , from the sureness and power she knew was there , in those strong hands . Her heart leapt . Something , somewhere in all those stars , had touched her . She thought : Jacen ! Her husband 's hands touched controls and the stars streamed away , turned to bleeding smears of light as if seen through beaten rain , and the distant touch vanished . " Jacen , " she said , and then , at her husband 's startled look , at the surprise and pain in his brown eyes , " Jacen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're sure it was Jacen ? " " Yes . Reaching out to me . I felt him . It could have been no one else . " " And he 's alive . " " Yes . " Leia Organa Solo could read him so well . She knew that Han believed their son dead , but that he tried , for her sake , to pretend otherwise . She knew that , fierce with grief and with guilt for having withdrawn from his family , he would support her in anything now , even if he believed it was delusional . And she knew the strength it took for him to suppress his own pain and doubt . She could read all that in him , in the flicker of his eye , the twitch of his cheek . She could read him , read the bravery and theuncertainty , and she loved him for both . " It was Jacen , " she said . She put as much confidence in her tone as she could , all her assurance . " He was reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to tell me he was alive and with friends . " She reached over and took his hand . " There 's no doubt , now . Not at all . " Han 's fingers tightened on hers , and she sensed the struggle in him , desire for hope warring with his own bitter experience . His brown eyes softened . " Yes , " he said . " Of course . I believe you . " There was a hint of reserve there , of caution , but that was reflex , the result of a long and uncertain life that had taught him to believe nothing until he 'd seen it with his own eyes . Leia reached for him , embraced him awkwardly from the copilot 's seat . His arms went around her . She felt the bristle of his cheek against hers , inhaled the scent of his body , his hair . A bubble of happiness grew in her , burst into speech . " Yes , Han , " she said . " Our son is alive . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything changes from now on . " *** The idyll lasted until Han and Leia walked hand in hand into the Millennium Falcon 's main hold . Through the touch , Leia felt the slight tension of Han 's muscles as he came in sight of their guest -- an Imperial commander in immaculate dress grays . Han , Leia knew , had hoped that this mission would provide a chance for the two of them to be alone . Through the many months since the war with the Yuuzhan Vong had begun , they had either been apart or dealing with a bewildering succession of crises . Even though their current mission was no less urgent than the others , they would have treasured this time alone in hyperspace . They had even left Leia 's Noghri bodyguards behind . Neither of them had wanted any passengers at all , let alone an Imperial officer . Thus far Han had managed to be civil about it , but only just . The commander rose politely to her feet . " An exceptionally smooth transition into hyperspace , General Solo , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a transition speaks well of the ship 's captain and his skills . " " Thanks , " Han said . " The Myomar shields are superb , are they not ? " she said . " One of our finer designs . " The problem with Commander Vana Dorja , Leia thought , was that she was simply too observant . She was a woman of about thirty , the daughter of the captain of a Star Destroyer , with bobbed dark hair tucked neatly into her uniform cap , and the bland , pleasant face of a professional diplomat . She had been on Coruscant during its fall , allegedly negotiating some kind of commercial treaty , purchasing Ulban droid brains for use in Imperial hydroponics farms . The negotiations were complicated by the fact that the droid brains in question could equally well be used for military purposes . The negotiations regarding the brains ' end-use certificates had gone nowhere in particular , but perhaps they had been intended to go nowhere . What Commander Dorja 's extended stay on Coruscant had done was to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resulted in the planet 's fall . Vana Dorja had gotten off Coruscant somehow -- Leia had no doubt that her escape had been planned long in advance -- and she had then turned up at Mon Calamari , the new provisional capital , blandly asking for help in returning to Imperial space just at the moment at which Leia had been assigned a diplomatic mission to that selfsame Empire . Of course it was n't a coincidence . Dorja was clearly a spy operating under commercial cover . But what could Leia do ? The New Republic might need the help of the Empire , and the Empire might be offended if its commercial representative were needlessly delayed in her return . What Leia could do was establish some ground rules concerning where on the Falcon Commander Dorja could go , and where was strictly off limits . Dorja had agreed immediately to the restrictions , and agreed as well to be scanned for any technological or other secrets she might be smuggling out . Nothing had turned up on the scan . Of course . If Vana Dorja was carrying any vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying them locked in her all-too-inquisitive brain . " Please sit down , " Leia said . " Your Highness is kind , " Dorja said , and lowered her stocky body into a chair . Leia sat across the table from her , and observed the half-empty glass of juri juice set before the commander . " Threepio is providing sufficient refreshment ? " Leia asked . " Yes . He is very efficient , though a trifle talkative . " Talkative ? Leia thought . What 's Threepio been telling the woman ? Blast it anyway . Dorja was all too skilled at creating these unsettling moments . " Shall we dine ? " Leia asked . Dorja nodded , bland as always . " As Your Highness wishes . " But then she proved useful in the galley , assisting Han and Leia as they transferred to plates the meal that had been cooking in the Falcon 's automatic ovens . As Han sat down with his plates , C-3PO contemplated the table . " Sir , " he said . " A Princess and former Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general and an Imperial commander . But a commander -- forgive me -- does not take precedence over a New Republic general , even one on the inactive list . General Solo , if you would be so kind as to sit above Commander Dorja ? " Han gave C-3PO a baleful look . " I like it fine where I am , " he said . Which was , of course , as far a droid with an immobile face to look . " But sir -- the rules of precedence --  " " I like it where I am , " Han said , more firmly . " But sir --  " Leia slid into her accustomed role as Han 's interpreter to the world . " We 'll dine informally , Threepio , " she told the droid . C-3PO 's tone allowed his disappointment to show . " Very well , Your Highness , " he said . Poor 3PO , Leia thought . Here he was designed for working out rules of protocol for state banquets involving dozens of species and hundreds of governments , interpreting and smoothing disputes , and instead she persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . And now the galaxy was being invaded by beings who had marked for extermination every droid in existence -- and they were winning . Whatever C-3PO had for nerves must be shot . Lots of formal dinner parties when this is over , Leia decided . Nice , soothing dinner parties , without assassins , quarrels , or light-saber fights . " I thank you again for your offer of transit to the Empire , " Dorja said later , after the soup course . " It was fortunate that you have business there . " " Very fortunate , " Leia agreed . " Your mission to the Empire must be critical , " Dorja probed , " to take you from the government at such a crucial time . " " I 'm doing what I do best . " " But you were Chief of State -- surely you must be considering a return to power . " Leia shook her head . " I served my term . " " To voluntarily relinquish power -- I confess I do n't understand it . " Dorja shook her head . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it is given to us . " Leia sensed Han 's head lifting as he prepared to speak . She knew him well enough to anticipate the sense of any remarks . No , he would say , Imperial leaders generally stay in their seats of power until they 're blasted out by laser cannons . Before Han could speak , she phrased a more diplomatic answer . " Wisdom is knowing when you 've given all you can , " she said , and turned her attention to her dinner , a fragrant breast of hibbas with a sauce of bofa fruit . Dorja picked up her fork , held it over her plate . " But surely -- with the government in chaos , and driven into exile -- a strong hand is needed . " " We have constitutional means for choosing a new leader , " Leia reassured . And thought , Not that they 're working so far , with Pwoe proclaiming himself Chief of State with the Senate deadlocked on Mon Calamari . " I wish you a smooth transition , " Commander Dorja said . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic has met its current crisis was the fault of Borsk Fey'lya 's government , and not symptomatic of the New Republic as a whole . " " I 'll drink to that , " Han proclaimed , and drained his glass . " I ca n't help but wonder how the old Empire would have handled the crisis , " Dorja continued . " I hope you will forgive my partisan attitude , but it seems to me that the Emperor would have mobilized his entire armament at the first threat , and dealt with the Yuuzhan Vong in an efficient and expeditious manner , through the use of overwhelming force . Certainly better than Borsk Fey'lya 's policy -- if I understood it correctly as a policy -- of negotiating with the invaders at the same time as he was fighting them , sending signals of weakness to a ruthless enemy who used negotiation only as a cover for further conquests . " It was growing very hard , Leia thought , to maintain the diplomatic smile on her face . " The Emperor , " she said , " was always alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Han about to speak , and this time was too late to stop his words . " That 's not what the Empire would have done , Commander , " Han said . " What the Empire would have done was build a super-colossal Yuuzhan Vong-killing battle machine . They would have called it the Nova Colossus or the Galaxy Destructor or the Nostril of Palpatine or something equally grandiose . They would have spent billions of credits , employed thousands of contractors and subcontractors , and equipped it with the latest in death-dealing technology . And you know what would have happened ? It would n't have worked . They 'd forget to bolt down a metal plate over an access hatch leading to the main reactors , or some other mistake , and a hotshot enemy pilot would drop a bomb down there and blow the whole thing up . Now that 's what the Empire would have done . " Leia , striving to contain her laughter , detected what might have been amusement in Vana Dorja 's brown eyes . " Perhaps you 're right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander , " Han said , and poured himself another glass of water . His brief triumph was interrupted by a sudden shriek from the Falcon 's hyperdrive units . The ship shuddered . Proximity alarms wailed . Leia , her heart beating in synchrony to the blaring alarms , stared into Han 's startled brown eyes . Han turned to Commander Dorja . " Sorry to interrupt dinner just as it was getting interesting , " he said , " but I 'm afraid we 've got to blow some bad guys into small pieces . " The first thing Han Solo did when he scrambled into the pilot 's seat was to shut off the blaring alarms that were rattling his brain around inside his skull . Then he looked out the cockpit windows . The stars , he saw , had returned to their normal configuration -- the Millennium Falcon had been yanked out of hyperspace . And Han had a good idea why , an idea that a glance at the sensor displays served only to confirm . He turned to Leia as she scrambled into the copilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this sector , or we 've hit a Yuuzhan Vong mine . " A dovin basal to be precise , an organic gravitic-anomaly generator that the Yuuzhan Vong used for both propelling their vessels and warping space around them . The Yuuzhan Vong had been seeding dovin basal mines along New Republic trade routes in order to drag unsuspecting transports out of hyperspace and into an ambush . But their mining efforts had n't extended this far along the Hydian Way , at least not until now . And there , Han saw in the displays , were the ambushers . Two flights of six coralskippers each , one positioned on either side of the dovin basal in order to intercept any unsuspecting transport . He reached for the controls , then hesitated , wondering if Leia should pilot while he ran for the turbolaser turret . No , he thought , he knew the Millennium Falcon , her capabilities , and her crotchets better than anyone , and good piloting was going to get them out of this trouble more than good shooting . " I 'd better fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the quad lasers . " Regretting , as he spoke , that he would n't get to blow things up , something always good for taking his mind off his troubles . Leia bent to give him a quick kiss on the cheek . " Good luck , Slick , " she whispered , then squeezed his shoulder and slid silently out of the cockpit . " Good luck yourself , " Han said . " And find out if our guest is qualified to take the other turret . " His eyes were already scanning the displays as he automatically donned the comlink headset that would allow him to communicate with Leia on the turbolasers . Coralskippers were n't hyperspace capable , so some larger craft had to have dropped them here . Was that ship still around , or had it moved on to lay another mine somewhere else ? It had gone , apparently . There was no sign of it on the displays . The Yuuzhan Vong craft were just now beginning to react to his arrival -- so much for the hope that the Millennium Falcon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what , he considered , had the enemy seen ? A Corellian Engineering YT-1300 freighter , similar to hundreds of other small freighters they must have encountered . The Yuuzhan Vong would n't have seen the Falcon 's armament , her advanced shields , or the modifications to her sublight drives that could give even the swift coralskippers a run for their money . So the Millennium Falcon should continue , as far as the Yuuzhan Vong were concerned , to look like an innocent freighter . While he watched the Yuuzhan Vong maneuver , Han broad-cast to the enemy a series of queries and demands for information of the sort that might come from a nervous civilian pilot . He conducted a series of basic maneuvers designed to keep the coralskippers at a distance , maneuvers as sluggish and hesitant as if he were a fat , nervous freighter loaded with cargo . The nearest flight of coralskippers set on a basic intercept course , not even bothering to deploy into military formation . The farthest flight , on the other side of the dovin basal mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others . Now that was interesting . In a short while they would have the dovin basal singularity between themselves and the Falcon , with the mine 's gravity-warping capabilities making it very difficult for them to see the Falcon or to detect any changes in her course . " General Solo ? " A voice on the comlink intruded on his thoughts . " This is Commander Dorja . I 'm readying the weapons in the dorsal turret . " " Try not to blow off the sensor dish , " Han told her . He looked at the displays , saw the far-side squadron nearing eclipse behind the space-time-distorting gravity mine . His hands closed on the controls , and he altered course directly for the dovin basal just as he gave full power to the sublight drives . The gravity mine was now between the Millennium Falcon and the far-side flight of coralskippers . The space-time warp surrounding the dovin basal would make it nearly impossible to detect the Falcon 's change of course . " We have about three standard minutes to contact with the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire dead ahead , on my mark . " " Dead ahead ? " came Dorja 's bland voice . " How unorthodox . . . have you considered maneuver ? " " Do n't second-guess the pilot ! " Leia 's voice snapped like a whip . " Keep this channel clear unless you have something of value to say ! " " Apologies , " Dorja murmured . Han bit back his own annoyance . He glanced at the empty copilot 's chair -- Chewbacca 's place , now Leia's -- and found himself wishing that he was in the second turbolaser cockpit , with Chew- bacca in the pilot 's seat . But Chewie was gone , the first of the deaths that had struck him to the heart . Chewbacca dead , his younger son Anakin killed , his older son Jacen missing , presumed dead by everyone except Leia . . . Death had been haunting his footsteps , on the verge of claiming everyone around him . That was why he had n't accepted Waroo 's offer to assume Chewbacca 's life debt . He simply had n't wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now Leia believed that Jacen was alive . This was n't a vague hope based on a mother 's desire to see her son again , as Han had earlier suspected , but a sending through the Force , a message aimed at Leia herself . Han had no direct experience of the Force himself , but he knew he could trust Leia not to misread it . His son was alive . So maybe Death was n't following him so closely after all . Or maybe Han had just outrun him . Stay alert , he told himself . Stay strong . You may not have to die today . Cold determination filled him . Make the Yuuzhan Vong pay instead , he thought . He made a last scan of the displays . The near-side flight had turned to pursue , dividing into two V formations of three coralskippers each . They had n't reacted very quickly to his abrupt change of course , so Han figured he was n't dealing with a genius commander here , which was good . It was impossible to see the far-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had a good read on their trajec-tory , and there had n't been any reason for them to change it . The dovin basal swept closer . The Falcon 's spars moaned as they felt the tug of its gravity . " Ten seconds , " Han told Leia and Dorja , and reached for the triggers to the concussion missile tubes . Anticipation drew a metallic streak down his tongue . He felt a prickle of sweat on his scalp . " Five . " He triggered the first pair of concussion missiles , knowing that , unlike the laser cannon , they did not strike at the speed of light . " Two . " Han triggered another pair of missiles . The Millennium Falcon 's engines howled as they fought the pull of the dovin basal 's gravity . " Fire . " The dovin basal swept past , and suddenly the display lit with the six approaching coralskippers . The combined power of the eight turbolasers fired straight at them . The six coralskippers had also split into two Vs of three craft each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were running into the Falcon and her armament at a com-bined velocity of better than 90 percent of the speed of light . None of them had shifted their dovin basals to warp space defensively ahead of them , and the pilots had only an instant to perceive the doom staring them in the face , and no time to react . The first vic ran right into the first pair of missiles and the turbolaser fire , and all three erupted in fire as their coral hulls shattered into fragments . The second formation , diverging , was not so suitably placed . One coralskipper was hit by a missile and pinwheeled off into the darkness , trailing flame . Another ran into a burst of turbolaser fire and exploded . The third raced on , looping around the gravity mine where Han 's detectors could no longer see it . Exultation sang through Han 's heart . Four kills , one probable . Not a bad start at evening the odds . The Millennium Falcon shuddered to the gravitic pull of the dovin basal . Han frowned as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip around the space mine and exit with enough velocity to escape the dovin basal 's gravity and get into hyperspace before the other flight of coralskippers could overtake him . But the dovin basal was more powerful than he 'd expected , or possibly the Yuuzhan Vong commander was actually ordering it to increase its gravitational attraction -- there was a lot the Republic did n't know about how the Yuuzhan Vong equipment worked , that was at least possible . In any case , the Falcon had n't picked up enough speed to be sure of a getaway . Which meant he had to think of something else brilliant to do . The other flight of six coralskippers was following him into the gravity well of the dovin basal , intent on following him . The one intact survivor of the second flight was in the act of whipping around the dovin basal , and would n't enter into his calculations for the present . Well , he thought , if it worked once ... " Hang on , ladies , " he called on the comlink . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swung Millennium Falcon around for another dive toward the dovin basal . Attack my galaxy , will you ? he thought . They had doubtless seen the beginnings of his maneuver , so he altered his trajectory slightly to put the space mine directly between himself and the oncoming fighters . Then he altered his trajectory a second time , just to be safe . If the enemy commander had any sense , he 'd be doing the same . Both sides were now blind . The problem was that the Yuuzhan Vong were alert to his tactics . They would n't just run blindly toward him : they would have their dovin basal propulsor units shifted to repel any attack , and they 'd come in shooting . " Be alert , people , " Han said . " We 're not going to be so lucky this time , and I ca n't tell precisely where your targets are going to be . So be ready for them to be anywhere , right ? " " Right , " Leia said . " Understood , " Dorja said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll see that your four lasers are aimed so as to fire on slightly diverging paths . " " Yes . " " Do n't readjust . There 's a reason for it . " " I presumed so . I wo n't change the settings . " A pang of sorrow touched Han 's heart . It was his son Anakin who had discovered that if he fired three shots into a Yuuzhan Vong vessel at slightly diverging courses , at least one shot would curve around the gravity-warping dovin basal shields and hit the target . The quad lasers had been set to accomplish this automati-cally , without Anakin 's eye and fast reflexes . Anakin , who died at Myrkr . " Twenty seconds , " Han said , to cover both his own rising ten-sion and the grief that flooded him . He triggered another pair of missiles at ten seconds , just in case he was lucky again and the enemy flight appeared right in front of him . And then , because he had no choice but to trust his luck , he fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from seeing Jacen again , he told the enemy . The next thing he knew plasma cannon projectiles of molten rock were cracking against Falcon 's shields , and there was a blinding flash dead ahead as the first pair of concussion missiles found a target . Han 's heart throbbed as coral debris pounded on the deflectors , bounded off like multicolored sparks . There was a flicker on the displays as another coralskipper flashed past at a converging speed somewhere close to that of light , too fast for Han 's eye to track it . If he had n't blown up the first coralskipper , he might have actually collided with it and been vaporized along with the enemy . Han tried to calm his startled nerves as he kept his eyes on the displays , searching for more enemy craft around and behind the dovin basal . In a moment he understood the enemy 's tactic . The two Vs of three had split into three pairs and curved around the dovin basal on separate paths , in the apparent hope that at least one pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they flew past each other . It had n't worked , but by sheer chance one of them had almost taken out the Millennium Falcon through ramming . What , Han wondered , were the odds on that ? The comm board began a rhythmic bleating , and Han shut it off . From the display he gathered that the Falcon had just lost her hyperspace comm antenna . Oh well . They had n't been planning to talk to anyone long distance , anyway . Feeling cheered by the thought that he 'd win the battle in jig time if he could go on killing at least one coralskipper with each pass , he prepared to swing the ship around and dive toward the dovin basal yet again . And then his displays lit up at the appearance of an enemy fighter , the one intact survivor from the flight of six he 'd splashed with his opening salvo . It was curving toward him , its plasma cannons spitting out a stream of molten projectiles . It was placed just so as to keep him from swinging around on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suppressed the curses that were ringing around the inside of his skull and instead warned his two gunners . " Enemy skip on the port side , ladies . " He maneuvered so as to put the target in the money lane , where the fields of fire of both sets of turbolasers overlapped , and he heard the quads begin to chunder . Coherent light flashed around the enemy craft , curving weirdly as the dovin basal 's singularity-curved space to safeguard the target . Enemy fire spattered off the Falcon 's shields . Then flame sprayed from the coralskipper as one of the turbolaser lances struck home . The craft seemed to stagger in its course . And then a second laser blast turned the coralskipper into a spray of flaming shards that shone briefly , like a falling fire-work , and was gone . " Nice shooting , Commander ! " Leia 's voice , complimenting Dorja on the kill . Han realized to his pleasure that Vana Dorja apparently was qualified on the turbolasers . Six down , one damaged , five to go . Han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dovin basal , but he knew that the last coralskipper had delayed his maneuver to the point where it might be the enemy pouncing on the Falcon this time , not the other way around . A glance at the displays showed the five intact coralskippers had swept around again , with each two-skip unit -- plus the singleton survivor of the third pair -- on widely diverging courses . They would be sweeping past the dovin basal at different times , approaching from different angles . This meant that no matter what Han did , he would n't be able to place the gravity-distorting singularity between himself and all the enemy at once . Those who could see him could communicate his position to those who could n't . The advantage he 'd made for himself was gone . Someone on the other side must have had a brainstorm . But , Han realized , the fact that the enemy flights had separated meant he would n't have to fight more than two at a time . That was something he could use . He looped around toward the dovin basal , letting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Han ? " Leia called . " Plenty left in the old bag of tricks ! " Han called back . But which trick ? That was a puzzler , all right . His mind sawed at the problem as he dived for the singularity . It was clear that the first pair of enemy skips would arrive at the singularity before he did , and the single fighter at about the same time as the Falcon , with the other pair arriving afterward . The only way he 'd be able to repeat the head-on attack that had worked the first time was if he did it on the third group of Yuuzhan Vong , and that meant running the gauntlet of the three other coralskippers . If he attacked the first pair , the others would arc around the dovin basal and be on his tail fast . The Yuuzhan Vong were prepared for any eventuality . Unless , of course , he simply did n't do what they expected . If he did n't dive into the dovin basal as their tactics clearly assumed . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braking thrusters . The Millennium Falcon slowed as if she 'd hit a patch of mud . " Skips crossing the bow port to starboard ! " he called . A volley of plasma cannon projectiles preceded the lead pair of fighters that arced from behind the blind spot of the dovin basal , bright glowing projectiles that curved strangely in the mine 's weird gravity well . The projectiles crossed the Falcon 's bows at a comfortable distance , followed an instant later by the fighters themselves , both moving too fast to alter their trajectory once they saw the Falcon 's position . Turbolaser fire pulsed around them , but Han did n't see any hits . He was already pouring power to the sublight engines , letting the space mine 's gravity well take the Falcon into its embrace . He nearly missed his timing : the plasma cannon volley that pre-ceded the single fighter 's appearance from around the singularity almost clipped his tail . The fighter itself crossed his stern at a blistering pace . Han wrenched the controls and altered course , heading not toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now counting on the fact that the enemy were communicating , but there was also an inevitable lag between their peron of the Falcon 's position , their transmission describing the position to comrades rendered blind on the far side of the dovin basal , and their comrades ' ability to act on that knowledge . He had dived for the dovin basal until the first pair of fighters were committed to their attack , then braked : the fighters had crossed ahead of him . Then , once the single fighter had been told the Falcon had slowed and altered its own course to intercept , Han had accelerated , and the fighter passed astern . That left the last two , who had been told that the Millennium Falcon had first slowed , then accelerated . If they appeared where Han thought they would , they were dead meat . " Fighters crossing starboard to port : lay down interdicting fire dead ahead , " Han ordered , sawing the Falcon around again , toward the singularity . It was easier to aim his ship at the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guys would appear . His heart gave a leap as the two coralskippers arced into sight right where he thought they 'd be , between the Falcon and the dovin basal , the two fighters flying wingtip to wingtip and preceded by a volley of molten projectiles that curved in the mine 's hyper-gravity . The turbolasers lay down a blistering fire right in their path and caught both ships broadside . One flamed and broke up , and the other soared off into the night , trailing fire . Seven down , two damaged ! A nice total , and the day had hardly begun . Adrenaline drew a grin across Han 's face . He dived for the singularity again , not because he knew what he was going to do next but because he wanted to hide : the three remaining fighters were curving around and about to drop onto his tail . But this time he did n't use the dovin basal to slingshot himself around onto a new trajectory : instead he worked the controls to go into orbit around the singularity , the Falcon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dovin basal 's gravity well . Ahead , through space warped by gravity , he saw what might be an enemy fighter . " Open fire dead ahead ! " he called again , and he saw laserfire streak outward , the bolts curving in the singularity 's gravity like a fiery rainbow . " Keep firing ! " he urged , and brought the Falcon 's nose up just a touch . The curving laser blasts climbed up the fighter 's tail and blew it to shreds . There was wild cheering from the gun turrets : even the restrained Commander Dorja was yelling her head off . " Fire dead aft ! " Han shouted over the noise as he fed power to the sublight engines : with the gravity well 's distortion affecting his perceptions , he had no idea where the remaining enemy were , and he was afraid they were behind him , ready to wax his tail just as he 'd waxed the single enemy fighter . Relief poured through him as scans showed his precautions were unnecessary : they 'd pulled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were well out of range . Han held his course to see if the enemy had had enough -- but no , they were coming around again , ready for more punishment . And two more fighters were heading for him , the two he 'd wounded , each coming in on its own trajectory . Han rolled the Millennium Falcon around , heading for one of the two single fighters , figuring he could knock out one of the damaged craft before taking on the pair of uninjured craft . And then proximity alarms blared , and Han 's display lit up with twenty-four fighters coming out of hyperspace right on his tail . Thwarted rage boiled through him . " We 've got company ! " he shouted , and pounded the instrument panel with a fist . " I 've got ta say this is really unfair --  ! " Then he recognized the new ships ' configuration , and he punched on the intership comm unit . " Unknown freighter , " came a voice on one of the New Republic channels , " alter course forty degrees to port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft came roaring in right past his cockpit . His nerves gave a leap as he recognized the dagged silhouettes of Chiss clawcraft , Sienar TIE ball cockpits and engines matched to forward-jutting Chiss weapons pylons , the design the result of their fruitful collaboration with the Empire under the Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn . Once upon a time , Han thought , TIE fighters on his tail would have been a bad thing . " Commander Dorja , " Han said , " we 've got some of your friends here . " Another two sections of clawcraft came roaring past , followed by three sections of New Republic E-wings . Directly in front of the Millennium Falcon the formation came apart in a starburst , one section of four heading for each of the remaining coral-skippers while two others remained in reserve . Han hit the TRANSMIT button . " Thanks , you guys , " he said , " but I was doing fine on my own . " " Unknown freighter , stand clear . " The voice had a slightly pompous ring , and Han thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " Whatever you say , sport , " Han replied , and then watched as four fighters ganged up on each of the coralskippers . The enemy craft could n't jump to hyperspace , and they could n't flee the fighters because they had been chasing the Millennium Falcon at near lightspeed and could n't alter course in time . The newly arrived fighters took no chances , just professionally hunted down each of the coralskippers and blew it to smithereens , taking no casualties in return . Then the allied squadron turned on the dovin basal mine and very carefully destroyed it with a calculated barrage of torpedoes and laser bursts . " Nice work , people , " Han congratulated them . " Please stay off this channel , sir , " the fighter commander said , " unless you have an urgent message . " Han grinned . " Not so urgent , Colonel Fel , " he said . " I 'd just like to invite you to a meeting here aboard the Millennium Falcon , with General Solo of the New Republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial Navy . " There was a long , lonely silence on the comm . " Yes , General Solo , " Jagged Fel said . " We would be honored , I 'm sure . " " Come right aboard , " Han said . " We 'll extend the docking arm . " And then , over the comlink , he called C-3PO and told the droid there would be guests for dinner . From the Hardcover edition .
