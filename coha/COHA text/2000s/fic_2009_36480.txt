Lorraine <p> I barely have got in the door good and it 's already three thirty in the afternoon . Church seemed like it lasted too long this morning and I did n't come straight home like I usually do . Althea was determined to take me over to her house cause she had fixed collards and was bound for me to have some with her cornbread and dumplings , so now I 'm ' bout to pop wide-open . She said she might not go to church so much if it was n't for me , it takes so much time out of a Sunday . I told her , " Do n't be puttin the burden of your soul on me , girl . You 're too hardheaded to change , and I 'm too smart to try and make you . " <p> Althea used to decorate cakes for a livin out of her own kitchen ' til it ' bout killed her it got to be so much work . She did birthdays , anniversaries , weddings of course , retirements , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't think there was much decoration on those . Now she works in an insurance office , mostly houses and cars is what they do . She picks me up on Sunday mornings for church sometimes , I think she likes to have some company ridin , and there ai n't no way her husband is gon go unless a meal is bein served . She is one drivin woman , I tell you that . Wants to go , go , go every minute . This morning we had time to drink a cup of coffee cause she got to my house so fast . I pulled out the cups and put four big spoons of sugar in hers or else she woulda asked me if I was tryin to put her on a diet . <p> " Well , " Althea said , raising her eyebrows when she took the hot coffee from me . " Lorraine , I 've had a revelation . " <p> " Was it the Ten Commandments ? " I asked . " Cause I ai n't so sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored me . " I had a dream last night . I woke up sweatin to death , and I remember every bit of it . There was a circle of candles and me sittin in the middle of em . " <p> " Is this voodoo , Althea , cause if it is . ? . ? . ? " <p> " You 're bad for interruptin somebody , you know that ? " <p> " I 'll hush . " I took too big a sip and burned my tongue . <p> Althea looked around like she was about to tell a secret even though there was n't a soul there but the two of us , sittin in my kitchen drinking coffee and gettin ready to be late for church . <p> She pushed her cup to one side so she could lean in across the table . " When I tried to step over the candles they flew up in the air like comets or something and disappeared , I mean poof . " She lowered her voice to a whisper . " Then I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his chest and stomach . Fine lookin too . Standing in front of a big pond , no , a lake , big as Jordan Lake , and he was waving at me to come across with him , only there was n't a boat or any other way to get across . Then he took a - couple of steps backwards with his pants rolled up , water lapping around his ankles . He kept on waving at me to come down there , and I thought to myself I do n't even know you , you might be tryin to drown me . " <p> I got up and ran some water in my empty cup , then set it in the sink . I would wash it later . <p> " Are you listenin to me ? " Althea snapped . <p> " I told you I would hush , that 's what I 'm doin . " <p> " Well I woke up , Lorraine , and I realized . That mighta been Moses I dreamed . Do you think it was Moses ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I did n't realize it . <p> " That 's all you got to say ? " <p> " Honey , what exactly 's the revelation ? " <p> " It 's time for me to cross over , Lorraine . That 's all I 'm sayin . " <p> " You gon die sometime soon ? " <p> Althea shook her head and reached for her coat . " I do n't know why I try to tell you anything . You do n't have my kind of vision . Let 's go to the car . " <p> Me and Althea go way back . She helped me just about raise my daughter , much as anybody did besides my mama . That 's how come she feels like she can act like a second mother to April . Some - people might not like another person tellin their child what to do , but I like it all right . Having to make all the rules all the time was n't never my idea of a party . I 'm grateful for the help . There 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to take whatever it looks like , their kind of help , and you ca n't be choosing what you like and do n't like . Help is a take it or leave it kind of thing , and if you ca n't take it like it comes , might as well leave it cause it 's gon be more trouble than it 's worth . Or you 're gon lose a friend in the process . <p> When April was little , we stayed at Mama 's . She did n't have many rules in her house except for one , and I made it my rule too . No matter what else was goin on , we had to sit down and eat breakfast together every day unless one of us was sick , and I mean so sick you could n't get yourself up out of the bed . Mama fixed food for me and April while I got ready to go to work . There was one morning , I remember cause I had just started my new job , I heard her call April in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the table , and knowing my daughter , she was probably readin something or other , still in the bed . <p> <br> Continues ...
