Some towns have it all-great schools , a thriving job market , safe streets , plenty to do . The best offer one thing more : a reason to go home again . // AFTER THEIR TWINS CAME ALONG , Wall Street professional Nancy Londres , now 41 , and her husband Tom decided there was only one place to settle down : her hometown , Moorestown , N.J. Londres ' childhood friend Saralee Michaud came home too , leaving Boston to raise her family and work as an assistant county prosecutor . Today Londres and Michaud live around the corner from each other . Just up the road is the produce stand owned by Naoji Moriuchi 's family , who have farmed here for three generations . Moriuchi himself returned a few years ago , leaving a marketing career in Wilmington , Del . Now , at 29 , he 's a real estate agent and a volunteer fire fighter . Welcome to Moorestown , MONEY magazine 's Best Place to Live for 2005 , a town where people comingup in the world can go home again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top schools . A Main Street made for the cover of the Saturday Evening Post . Good jobs . Nice homes at reasonable prices . And something else . " I love the feel of this place , " says Moriuchi . Londres concurs : " It 's a true community . There are at least 10 families on our street alone that I know from high school , and my daughter 's firstgrade teacher lives two doors away . " We spent months looking for Great American Towns-the kinds of places where you would want to raise your children , celebrate life 's milestones and climb the ladder of your career . ( For details on our methodology and a list of 100 Best Places , see pages 82 and 83 . To check out the 1,300 places in our database , go to money.com/bestplaces . ) Our top 10 towns , which we 'll profile below , begin with Moorestown , a mix of information age progress and traditional Americana that 's hard not to love and easy to come home to . Londres , now a stay-at-home mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Street like her mother did . Down the street from Moriuchi 's real estate office , the hot spot is Passariello 's , where giant U-shaped booths easily fit a group of 10 and all the pizza they can eat . The town , founded by Quakers , bans the sale of alcohol , but there 's plenty of night life in Philadelphia , just 15 miles away . Moorestown is more ethnically diverse than many suburbs of its size . And as for the schools , the district had to hire another Latin teacher-yes , Latin-because the language is so popular . Summer 's big event is the town play . Mayor and local lawyer Kevin Aberant will play a marshal in this year 's production of Oklahoma ! Moorestown is a good place to work too . Lockheed Martin 's radar-systems division is based here , and Computer Science Corp . and PNC Bank are big local employers . About half the work force commutes to Philadelphia . Easy access to highways means a trip to the Jersey Shore takes less than an hour , and New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But because no major road runs through Moorestown , sprawl stops at the town line . That 's not to say growth does n't present challenges . Last year , a shopping center anchored by Costco and Target opened on the border with Mount Laurel , increasing traffic through town . And much of Moorestown 's farmland has been lost to subdivisions . Home prices are up about 50% in the past five years , but compared with the suburbs of many big northeastern cities , Moorestown remains affordable . A fourbedroom home within walking distance of town goes for $400,000 to $500,000 , and starter homes can be had for much less . " Moorestown still feels like a small town , " says Michaud . " And the schools are amazing . I want my kids to come back and raise their children here too . " 2 Bainbridge Island , Wash . POPULATION : 21,600 TYPICAL SINGLEFAMILY HOME : $500,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $4,000 + PROS Gorgeous area ; outdoor activities - CONS Life revolves around the ferry . When Jerry Jones got the green light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife Kathy made a checklist detailing their ideal community : a small town with good schools , rational home prices , nice views and easy access to big-city amenities . In April the Oklahoma natives and their seven-year-old daughter Anna moved to Bainbridge Island , a 28-square-mile haven that 's a 35-minute ferry ride from downtown Seattle . " It 's like being on vacation all the time , " says Kathy , 44 . She and Jerry , a tax consultant , stumbled onto Bainbridge while visiting Seattle a decade ago and were smitten with its lush woods , ocean views and quaint downtown . Beauty is one thing . What about brains ? " The schools are what really sold us , " says Jerry , 46 . Residents have never failed to pass an education-related tax levy , and they typically make extra contributions that increase the school budget by another 5% . Of course , island living is n't for everyone . You can drive to the Olympic Peninsula via bridge , but people rely on the ferry , and the isolation can be tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commutes to Seattle every day , according to David Harrison , a senior lecturer at the University of Washington 's Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs and an 18year islander . On the plus side , the trip is predictable , and it can even be productive thanks to wireless Internet access . 3 Naperville , Ill . POPULATION : 142,500 TYPICAL SINGLEFAMILY HOME : $450,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $6,500 + PROS An incredibly clean and safe city ; plenty to do ; 33-minute train ride to Chicago - CONS Traffic jams ; surrounding sprawl Take a summer night 's walk through the center of Naperville and you 'll find smalltown peace . Along the Riverwalk , a fivemile brick path that follows the DuPage River , everyone from young parents to teens and senior citizens stops to chat with everyone else . Yet Naperville-with its six-figure population , every kind of shopping you could want , first-run theaters , and restaurants to suit every tasteis a real city . The seamless coexistence of big-city and small-town life drew Bruce and Amanda Hanson , 38 and 37 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have all the advantages of a city without any of the stress , " says Bruce , now father to 17-month-old twins Nathan and Anneliese . The twins will attend atop-ranked school district whose recent awards include first place in an international math and science competition . The city library has been named the best in its population category six years running . There 's a six-acre swimming area located in a former rock quarry , and a thriving bar scene downtown , plus city-sponsored concerts and other events most weekends . The big negative : Drive for two minutes out of town in any direction and you 're likely to be sitting in traffic on a highway . Home prices have risen sharply with Naperville 's popularity . Expect to pay at least $350,000 for a three-bedroom starter home ; many of those are being torn down for million-dollar manses. 4 Vienna , Va . POPULATION : 15,300 TYPICAL SINGLEFAMILY HOME : $650,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $7,000 + PROS Historical feel ; hot job market - CONS Home prices and traffic Mark Namdar has thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years they 've lived in Vienna , figuring he could buy more house and more land elsewhere . " Every time we looked around , " he says , " we were n't impressed . " So the Namdars recently decided to renovate and stay put . Vienna , says Namdar , a hotel manager in Washington , offers character that 's lacking in other D.C. suburbs . Much of bustling Fairfax County feels like it was built last week . Not Vienna , a muchprized piece of ground in the Civil War . An active historical society is run out of the antebellum Freeman House , which served as a makeshift Civil War hospital and later as a post office , a general store and a train depot . Kids can even attend a summer history camp . Today , Vienna is valued for its jobs and schools . Median income is more than $110,000 , and IBM , Capital One and AOL are among dozens of big-name companies with large operations in the area . And D.C. and federal employment are just 15 miles away . Unfortunately , jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the median home price in Vienna has nearly doubled . Older homes can be had for $500,000 , but new construction goes for north of $700,000 . On the plus side , property taxes are n't bad and the local high school consistently ranks among the country 's best . Music , dance and opera run year round in indoor and outdoor theaters at Wolf Trap , the nation 's only national park for performing arts . Everyone shares one complaint : traffic on Maple Street . Driving the two-mile main drag can take up to 25 minutes during rush hour . But families like the Namdars swear the hassles are worth it . " We like the sense of neighborhood , " says Mark . " And it 's safe . The kids can be independent without our having to worry . " 5 Louisville , Colo . POPULATION : 19,600 TYPICAL SINGLEFAMILY HOME : $350,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $2,000 + PROS Sunshine ; clean air ; no crowds - CONS Tech-heavy job market Many small towns define themselves by their proximity to a nearby city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're 25 miles from sprawling Denver and just six miles from the hip college mecca of Boulder , people here talk about their hometown like it 's a refuge , not a suburb . " We wanted to get away from the congestion and crowds in Boulder , " says Jessica Wible , 38 , who moved to Louisville with her family three years ago . The downtown is a no-stoplight street lined with 100-year-old wood buildings in which you 'll find eclectic stores and coffee shops that offer tarot readings . The trip to McCaslin Boulevard , the major ' shopping area , is a short hop on uncrowded roads . This being Colorado , great skiing , hiking , rock climbing and golf are no more than an hour 's drive . But paradise comes at a price . The area suffered in the last technology downturn , and it will in the next one . Take in the view of the Rocky Mountains from a Louisville home , however , and it 's clear why people roll the dice on the economy . " I would ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and they would never go back , " says Arlin Lehman , who owned a medical equipment business and now heads up the Downtown Business Association . 6 Barrington , R.I. POPULATION : 16,900 TYPICAL SINGLE-FAMILY HOME : $500,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $6,000 + PROS No point in town is more than two miles from salt water . - CONS Few restaurants ; main road clogged at rush hour ; little ethnic diversity Bordered on three sides by water , this small town on Narragansett Bay retains the leisurely feel of its days as an early20th-century summer resort . Shops are clustered along County Road , the main street that runs through Barrington , but the commercial hub is small . While Barrington homes have gotten pricier , the town is an affordable alternative to tonier neighbors like Newport , and the test scores at Barrington 's six public schools are the highest in Rhode Island . Providence , which is enjoying a renaissance , is just 10 miles to the northwest , and people also commute to Boston , an hour and 15 minutes away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents flock to the 17-mile East Bay bike path , which connects Barrington with Providence and Bristol . " We were looking for a small-town New England life , " says Laura Pothin , who moved from West Point , N.Y . to Barrington two years ago with her husband John and their two kids . " Families are always out walking , and kids are riding bikes . " 7 Middleton , Wis . POPULATION : 17,000 TYPICAL SINGLE-FAMILY HOME : $250,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $4,500 + PROS Proximity to Madison ; parks - CONS Summer traffic ; little ethnic diversity Talk with Middleton residents about their town , and education comes up first or second in the conversation . " The schools were one of the biggest draws for us , " says Eric Foxman , 32 , who recently relocated from Los Angeles with his wife Heather , 33 , and four-month-old Kyle . In a threeyear average of state test scores , Middleton students ranked within the top three districts in all subjects . Residents occasionally gripe about the property taxes that come with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well here . Middleton is five miles from the state capital of Madison , which is also home to the main campus of the University of Wisconsin . Besides teaching and government , law , biotech and medicine are the big professions . Those who make serious bucks head for Middleton Hills , a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired development where home prices start at $450,000 . But a nice house in town can be had for about half that price . You need n't leave Middleton to cross-country ski or to hike pristine wooded trails . Wisconsin winters make for a short road-repair season , so summer delays are common . Madison is where most night life is , but Middleton recently opened a performing arts center . 8 Peachtree City , Ga . POPULATION : 35,000 TYPICAL SINGLE-FAMILY HOME : $300,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $3,000 + PROS Ideal balance of convenience and community - CONS Ten miles of sprawl between town and the interstate ; long commute to Atlanta Peachtree City 's roots do n't run as deep as those of other great American towns , but it maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers decided to turn 12,000 acres of farmland 29 miles southwest of Atlanta into a community of four villages and two man-made lakes . Each village has its own retail area , parks and schools , but the 10,000 families in Peachtree City are all neighbors , connected by 88 miles of winding paths made for golf carts , which can be found in almost every garage . " Life is a lot sweeter at 18 miles per hour . It forces you to slow down , " explains Mayor Steve Brown . The school system is good ; the crime rate practically zero . Despite tremendous sprawl around Atlanta over the past decade , Peachtree City bursts with green , thanks to a rule that limits development and commercial signage . " It 's a good place to come home to , " says Cal Beverly , editor of the local newspaper and a Peachtree City resident for 28 years . 9 Chatham , N.J. POPULATION : 17,600 TYPICAL SINGLE-FAMILY HOME : $700,000 EST . PROPERTY TAXES : $7,500 10 Mill Valley , Calif . POPULATION : 13,400 TYPICAL SINGLE-FAMlLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these pretty towns , ideally located near big , glamorous cities , would rank higher on our list but for one thing : home prices . Chatham , just 24 miles west of New York City , feels more like a small New England town than a bustling Big Apple burb . Locals gather for lunch and gossip at Cafe Beethoven . On weekend nights , it 's the hot spot for live jazz . Across the way at the train station-with a 45minute link to Manhattan-commuters are on the honor system when they toss money into a basket for morning coffee and muffins . Not everyone works in New York : The corporate headquarters of Lucent and Schering Plough , among others , are nearby . The town 's top-rated schools and the direct rail to New York , which started nine years ago , have made buying into Chatham an expensive proposition . You ca n't touch a decent home for less than $600,000 , and most cost much more . In Mill Valley , home prices are nearly as breathtaking as the views from nearby Mount Tamalpais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power couples in the film and music industries are flocking to what not so long ago was a hangout for artists and reformed hippies just nine miles from the Golden Gate Bridge . Yet most residents seem to love the town 's low-key , back-tonature atmosphere . Think fleece and flip-flops , not fur and stilettos . For those working toward that first million-not including their home equity-downtown San Francisco is a 30-minute commute .
