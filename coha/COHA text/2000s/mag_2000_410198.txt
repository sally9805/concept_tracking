// Sometimes all it takes is some time in the wild and a circle of friends to discover you can run with the wolves , beat back the bears - and even erect a tent without the guys . We 've got nothing against guys - honest . Some of our best friends are men . But there comes a time when a woman has to prove she can live without " em - if only for a night or two , I arrived at this truth on a recent camping trip with Hub . As I stood out of his way , he erected the tent ( built the campfire , purified the water ) and was about to start our freeze-dried dinner when something in me snapped . " Hey , wait a minute ! " I said , seizing the pan . " I 'm boiling the water ! " Photograph Readers Christi Solomon ( left ) and Kelly Engle accept the " Girls " Night Out " challenge to venture into the wild and learn camping and wilderness skills . // From such moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized the woods were n't the only place I had hung back in the belief somebody else could do it better . I was doing it everywhere - and not just with men . Shape decided what women like me need is a self-empowering experience in the wilds - a Survival School Lite with a nurturing girl guide as our pathfinder . We recruited two readers eager to accept the Girls ' Night Out Challenge : Give us a night or two in the wilds without men and we 'll turn you into women who run with the wolves - not away from them . Our picks were Christi Solomon , 24 , manager of a bath and beauty store in Charleston , S.C. , ( who had n't camped since she was 8 years old ) and Kelly Engle , 34 , a single mom and paralegal from Palm Beach Gardens , Fla . ( Her last camping experience was the KOA campground near Disney World . ) Neither had ever carried a backpack , built a campfire or even - you know - in the woods . Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go camping without a man ? " she said . " Ha ! I ca n't even put up a tent . " Christi was tired of being dismissed ( by women as well as by men ) as a " sweet young thang " when she knew deep down inside she was really a steel magnolia . But it was more than just the notion of camping without guys that appealed to them . As well as learning new wilderness and problem-solving skills , both were looking for an adventure that would test their physical endurance and emotional mettle and help them move beyond their comfort zones in the wilds and in everyday life . " There are so many things I want to try - from training for a triathlon to speaking out more at work , " said Kelly . " But then these self-limiting thoughts come up and stop me . " Christi confessed that ever since college she 'd felt " stuck " in a safe little box of her own making . I know I should be doing more with my life than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But what ? I 'm like Sleeping Beauty@ I 'm asleep in this castle waiting for someone to rescue me when I really have everything I need to rescue myself- if I only find a way to jump-start myself " The three of us were also admittedly lame when it came to matters of the dirt . ( " How many nights do we have to go without a bath ? " wondered Christi . ) As well as that pesky bubble-bath gene , I had another problem . Call me a 300-count princess , but I 'd never met a sleeping bag I could actually sleep in - I was either too hot and sweaty or too cold and clammy . I 've spent most camping trips stumbling around like a zombie from " Night of the Living Dead . " I ca n't tell you how many adventures I 've turned down because they involved a sleeping bag . For our girl guide , we chose Kristine Huffman , executive director of health and healing at Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires in Massachusetts . A two-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hiked 20 miles a day with only a knife , tin cup and water purification drops , subsisted on juniper berries and slept on the bare ground without a tent . Now she was ready to share her knowledge . But when she told her soon-to-be-ex ( an **45;684;TOOLONG instructor ) that we 'd chosen her to lead us , she said , " He looked at me like , who did I think I was ? " The plan : Spend a couple of days at a cozy cabin in the woods learning basic wilderness skills , do a ropes course to build confidence , then head out for two days of backpacking and camping . The place : Camp Canadensis in Pennsylvania 's Pocono Mountains , a designer camp for kids , was equipped with everything we 'd need - from the cozy cabin to miles of wilds . Foiled by Floyd We spent the first day at camp inching across tightropes 30 feet up and executing flying leaps of faith from a zip line , pausing occasionally to ( at Kristine 's suggestion ) " take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . Back at the cabin , Kristine suggested that we write our own rules ( what 's a Girls ' Night Out without a Book of Rules ? ) , both to steer our course and track our progress . Our first ( lifted shamelessly from the Girl Scouts ) was : Be prepared . Which brings up Floyd , a guy we definitely could have done without . Our original plan was to arrive at camp the weekend before the adventure to double-check the gear , map , route , trail markers , campsites , continue breaking in our boots , etc . Unfortunately , Hurricane Floyd roared in that weekend and closed airports from Florida to Pennsylvania . So much for prep time . In the real world ( not to be confused with the world of publishing ) we 'd have postponed the trip a few days to get prepared . But in the magazine biz , as on Broadway , the show must go on . Photograph Solomon and 4 Engle 's excellent adventures ( from left ) : hiking , learning the ropes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . As any weary hiker could attest , the success of a backwoods outing is directly proportional to the weight of your pack . ( Rule 2. - Pack light . ) Unfortunately , with a mound of gear ( our own stuff plus 20 boxes of gear manufacturers had sent for us to field-test ) , we hardly knew where to begin . Fortunately , Girl Guide did : Stalking the merchandise , she announced the platoon-sized tent was " out ! " Ditto for an adorable little turquoise number we dubbed " the love tent . " As for the complicated-looking water filters - torpedo-shaped bottles which bore a startling resemblance to what we wanted to leave behind ( or at least a crucial part of their anatomy ) : " out ! " ( We took a small , portable filter instead . ) Having reduced the mountain to a foothill , Kristine showed us how to pack , with heavy stuff on bottom so our hips , not our shoulders , would carry the brunt of the weight . My pack felt light , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kristine rummaged through her pack , removed several pounds and re-balanced the load . " How 's it now ? " she asked . " Better , " said Christi . Walk Tall and Carry a Two-Way Radio Camp co-owner Terri Saltzman ( aka " Aunt T. " ) was impressed with our spunk but nervous about us venturing out alone on her 1,000 back acres . We 'd already turned down her kind offer to cater our campfire dinners ( and send in her camp counselors to protect us ) . But one look at the camp 's " trail guide , " a 20-year-old " map " consisting of dotted lines wandering in concentric circles ( " It 's " Where 's Waldo , " " mumbled Kristine ) was all we needed to take her up on the two-way radio . Aunt T. was visibly relieved . Plus , not that they would ever hurt a soul , but did she happen to mention the camp had its own clan of cave bears ? " Well , at least they 're family , " said Kristine . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright . A The weather gods were with us ; the trail gods were not . As we 'd suspected , the red trail did n't connect to the blue or even the green one but went straight to a stream bed and drowned . Rule 3 : Always carry a good map and a compass . Photograph ... getting ready to portage , dangling 30 feet up from a trusty zip line and roasting marshmallows. // Kristine laid her compass on the map to establish our whereabouts , then suggested ( since Kelly 's and Christi 's feet were starting to hurt ) that we stop for brunch and a quick lesson on blister control . Rule 4 : Always break in your boots gradually . A few hours later , we reached the campsite where a trio of Native American tepees pierced a threatening sky . A closer inspection revealed that Floyd had left puddles in our bedrooms and soaked the campsite 's woodpile . Kristine whipped out four ponchos from her mother pack for an impromptu tent floor , then led Christi and Kelly to a spring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four bottles ' worth , she showed them how to build a campfire using a tiny nest of twigs , then sent them into the woods to gather what little dry firewood they could find . To be honest , between the four of us we could n't find quite enough dry kindling to keep the spark going ( even though Christi and Kelly had come back with armloads of logs ) . But Girl Guide was nothing if not inventive . With a grin bordering on the sadistic , Kristine crumpled up the trail guide , shoved it under the " nest " Christi and Kelly had carefully built , and lit a match . In a minute , we had a campfire and another rule . Rule 5 : When life hands you lemons , make lemonade . Weighing the Options Over a gourmet campfire dinner ( Kristine 's mother pack also housed a $12 jar of organic walnut butter and a $7 jar of olive tapenade ) , we enumerated the day 's marvels : sunlight streaming through the leaves , deer leaping through the woods , Kristine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christi for being such troupers on the trail . Considering the map , the traits and the general mess Floyd had made of things , we decided it was only fair to give them an option : We could camp out two nights ( as planned ) , or hike out tomorrow night . Before retiring , we stashed the food in duffel bags . Kristine got out a rope for the bear line , test the clan decide to pay us a visit . After several frustrating attempts to clear the limb ( about 15 feet up ) , she handed the rope to Kelly , at 5 feet 11 inches tall our best shot , who slamdunked it in three tries . " Yeah , team ! " cried Kristine . We did a victory dance around the fire and wrote another rule . Rule 6 : Never miss a chance to celebrate the small stuff . Meanwhile , inside my dark wigwam , my sleeping bag lay waiting like a bad blind date . As if reading my mind , Kristine put an arm around my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sweet dreams . " I awoke ( which meant I 'd actually fallen asleep ! ) to the sound of Aunt T. walking in with cinnamon bread and a big thermos of hot chocolate ( Kristine 's organic oatmeal did n't stand a chance . ) After breakfast , we packed up and hiked toward Camp 2 . After circling two lakes no one remembered seeing on the map we 'd torched the night before , the trail dead-ended at a tree with four different markers . Beyond was a forest of blank stares . Kelly and Christi stayed behind with the packs while Kristine and I bushwhacked ahead , using her compass and the sun to find Camp 2 , marking a new trail with logs and rock piles as we went . We backtracked to the girls and led them to Camp 2 without a hitch . Once there , they amazed us ( and , I think , themselves ) by erecting the tents on their own . In addition , they set up the two-burner stove , purified five bottles of water for dinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio phone crackled . It was Aunt T wondering if she could come for dinner and , in return , drive our packs out ? Kelly and Christi looked ecstatic . Not that they were n't having a blast . But - honestly ? They could really use a bath . " We feel like wimps , " said Christi , but Kristine reminded them that life is all about choices , and that it takes courage to acknowledge your limitations . Meanwhile , as long as Aunt T was coming for dinner , could she bring in some stuff for S'Mores ? It was a banner meal followed by an evening of heartfelt sharing : Kelly could n't believe she 'd carried a backpack 12 miles in two days . " The selflimiting thoughts came up , but 1 had no choice but to keep hiking and tell them to go away , " she said . Christi was astonished she 'd been able to weather two whole days without a bath . As the moon glowed through the trees we joined hands in a " Kumbaya " moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the van that we noticed the flat . Unfortunately , Girl Guide was no mechanic , and the counselors were away from camp and their radios . " Now what ? " demanded Aunt T. " Well , " said Kristine , " We have plenty of flashlights , and we know the road goes back to camp . So you can hike back with us or camp here with me . " " Hike ? " cried Aunt T " Camp ? " " That 's what we like best about Kristine , " said Kelly . " She always gives us a choice . " Aftermath Aunt T. walked all the way out with us that night without a whimper . Last we heard , she was on the phone telling everyone she 'd hiked two miles in the dark with just a flashlight . It was just the nudge she needed to go to Canyon Ranch and get in shape , she says . Kelly said carrying the pack made her realize she can do anything . She 's applying to law school . Ditto for Christi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intern at Shape . I bought the sleeping bag . The hightech bag had just the right amount of insulation and padding to keep me warm and asleep . Kristine learned you do n't need to eat juniper berries to undergo a lifechanging experience .
