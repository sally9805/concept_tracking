Like Harry Potter peering into the mirror of Erised , investors examining this wacky stock market can see exactly what they want to see . The fumbled election ? Terrible news , say the grim . No clear winner ; no telling what 's in store . Wonderful news , say the glib . So much confusion means so much gridlock in Congress that we 'll probably not get any dumb spending bills or tax cuts . Read : The surplus is safe . <P> It 's important to look beyond the election , though , because its bizarreness is merely masking a market that is already more confused than a Palm Beach voter . Equally ambiguous are readings of the economy , dollar and investor psychology . <P> Take the economy . Everyone knows it 's slowing and that corporate profits will fade in tandem . Bad news for stocks , right ? But wait . With inflation tame , the Federal Reserve has room to lower interest rates , prevent a recession and kick off another bounteous period of accelerating growth . <P> The strong dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. goods less attractive abroad , hurting multinational companies like Gillette and Goodyear . But it 's also luring tons of foreign investment to the U.S. , putting a floor under stock and bond prices . <P> As for investor psychology , it has turned circus-freak ugly . Not a serious buyer in sight . Cash is piling up in money funds , which stand at a record $1.8 trillion . Cash at stock mutual funds equals 5.3% of assets , up from 4% in March . Yet to bulls , these stockpiles represent buying power ready to push prices higher . " I 've never seen so many people on Wall Street talking to so many other people on Wall Street trying to figure out what 's happening , " confesses John Manley , a market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney . <P> And these are the professionals . As you 've probably heard by now , the stock market , like some dim-witted clerk , applies a generous markdown to what it ca n't figure out . Thus the NASDAQ index fell 12% during election week and plunged again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tuesday but was dishearteningly choppy the rest of the week . The Dow has been on its own treacherous sawtooth course , breaking the will of many who had expected a year-end rally to take shape by now . <P> The rally may yet come . As noted , the bulls can make a case , one largely hinged on lower interest rates . But for now , rates are steady , and the bears are in control . Long-term investors may want to start building positions . Do n't be surprised , though , if tech bellwethers sink more before a sustained recovery . That 's especially true of those with rich valuations like Cisco and fiber-optics darlings Corning and JDS Uniphase . <P> Forget the profitless dotcoms . Better to hunt for beaten-up telecom stocks like Verizon and WorldCom , which are now popping up on the screens of dyed-in-the-wool value managers . The tech tortured can seek solace among energy services , banks and insurers , consumer staples and health care . Stay diversified and somewhat conservative . An all-purpose growth-and-income fund might be just the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market is seeing a dark cloud behind every silver lining .
