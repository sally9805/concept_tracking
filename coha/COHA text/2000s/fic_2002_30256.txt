Chapter One What a disastrous start to the day , Jasmine March thought as she stared down at her husband 's nubile lover , dead on her kitchen floor . Jasmine held her breath and surveyed the vivid crime scene . Her special marble roiling pin lay six inches from the girl 's bashed temple . Blood pooled in a rich raspberry hue . On the counter , tinfoil balanced askew over the plate of Jasmine 's homemade chocolate brownies . Jasmine winced . One of the brownies was stuffed into the girl 's mouth . As Jasmine gazed down at the young woman 's willowy waist , she was sure of only two things . One , her husband 's birthday dinner was ruined . Two , her roiling pin , thank God , was not chipped . It was two months ago to the day when it all began to go wrong . When Jasmine woke that morning she 'd been dreaming of breakfast . Not cornflakes or melba toast , skim milk and a sorry slice of apple . No , Jasmine was elbow deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next , a plate of eggs Sardou : poached eggs nestled sweetly in the baby-smooth bottoms of artichokes and napped with a blushing spiced hollandaise sauce . Jasmine stared up at the ceiling , her mouth a swamp of saliva as she mentally mopped the rest of the hollandaise sauce with a crust of crunchy French bread beforetaking a sip of nutty chicory coffee and reaching for a freshly fried beignet so covered with powdered sugar it made her sneeze . Closing her eyes , she tried to burrow back into the warm scents of hot sugar and caffeine . Her skin flushed pink at the thought of it . But the dream eluded her . Jasmine swung her legs off the bed She gave the heavy fold of her backside a good scratch as she stepped across the room and sat down at her desk . And started to work : First heat one tablespoon butter in a flameproof casserole . Brown the meat over medium-high ( in batches if necessary ) . Using a slotted spoon transfer the meat to a bowl and set aside . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ' Jasmine ! ' Jasmine stopped typing . ' What ? ' ' We out of yogurt ? ' Daniel called from the kitchen downstairs . ' Look behind the deviled testicles . ' ' The what ? ' ' The duck testicles . ' ' Jesus . ' Jasmine heard her husband rummage through their extra-large steel-encased refrigerator , then the door slam . She continued . She erased one tablespoon of butter and typed three . As far as she was concerned , the more butter the better . There was no substitute for butter . Fresh , creamy butter . She shuddered at the current trend of blaming all ills on food . Food did n't kill people , for God 's sake , people killed people . With their harping , and criticizing , and careful living . Show Jasmine a skinny woman and you 'd be showing her mentally deficient being . Were n't neurotics invariably skinny ? Was n't it the scrawny , hungry soul who created the most havoc in the world ? Do n't get her started . Jasmine licked her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiced Lentils , Hot Ham and Bacon Biscuits , Cassoulet Salad with Garlic Sausages . After three cookbooks , she was finally finding her voice . She had discovered her future lay in rustic , not structure . Oh , she had tried the nouvelle rage . Who could forget her Breast of Chicken on a Bed of Pureed Grapes , her Diced Brie and Kumquat Salsa , her Orange and Chocolate Salad with Grand Marnier Vinaigrette ? But her instincts had rightly moved her closer to large portions . She hated the increasing fad of so much visible white plate . She preferred mounds of gorgeous food and puddles of sauces . Jasmine kneaded her heavy flesh and smiled . She had finally found her term . She was going to be a gastrofeminist . She would be Queen of Abundance , Empress of Excess . No apologies of appetite for her , no ' No thank you , I 'm full , ' no pushing away her plate with a sad but weary smile . Her dishes would fulfill the deepest , most primal urge . Beef stews enriched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripping with Calvados and butter , pork sauted with shallots , lots of cream , and mustard . Jasmine smiled with satisfaction . She could n't imagine a world without cookbooks . A world where a haunch was slapped on the fire and deposited partially grilled , bloody , and smelly on the plate . No sauce , no perfectly planned accompanying vegetable . Oh , a root vegetable perhaps , boiled beyond recognition . And that was only if the cook of the house was familiar with chemistry . No , life without cookbooks was unimaginable . Like Christianity without a Bible . Jasmine had her mission : to lead the others to the Big One , the most delicious mouthful they 'd ever consumed . It was not a vocation for the fragile . Her stomach was heavy with tasting . Her tongue charred from impatience . Her hands shredded from the testing of recipes . All that scrapping and slicing and tearing . And then , of course , there were her wrists , always on the verge of seizing up with stress , so quickly , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophet suffers and suffer she would if it meant one more decent meal on the public 's table ... ' Jasmine ! ' ' What ! ' ' The bran . ' ' You ate it all . ' The moan of a self-impaled man came from the kitchen . ' There might be a spare box behind the semolina . ' Jasmine still remembered the first time she saw a cookbook . Fourteen and in urgent need to rid herself of her virginity , she had just offered it to one seventh-grade boy before finally withdrawing the offer after twenty minutes of his ineffectual groping . As she flounced downstairs from his bedroom , she caught sight of his mother 's bookcase filled with brightly colored cookbooks . She sat right down as if struck like a gong and began to read , amazed at the heaven before her . She read the cookbooks like novels , each recipe a chapter . The list of ingredients was the beginning , the instructions the complications of the story , the presentation the climax , and the optional substitutions , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own pen and paper and try to create recipes that had never seen the light or palate before : masterpieces like Potato Chip Salad , Squash Strudel , Baked Mustard Custard . Her problem , she knew from the beginning , was that she lacked regionality . Washington , D.C. , was not known for its culinary tradition . She had grown up with no regional cooking and so could not whip up the homey , nostalgic cuisines of her mother 's mother 's mother . No genetically ingrained cream and flour sauces in her family for fourteen generations . She could n't even claim a familial authentic New England clam chowder or a southern fried succotash . She was a culinary orphan and as such would have to invent herself . Never one for baby steps , Jasmine threw herself into beef Wellingtons , bouillabaisses , even Bocuse 's signature onion soup with its puff pastry top . Instead of clothes like the other girls , she saved her money to buy truffles , forking over her precious dollars and scurrying home with a fraction of an ounce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure had been sour cream instead of plain potato chips on her tuna casserole , was nervous . The whole teenage obsession reeked of impropriety , though she could n't exactly explain why . She could n't in a million years ask Jasmine to refrain from cooking because she feared she was becoming a vassal to the devil , Instead she began sitting down to dinner every night a bit fearfully , picking through the food like a land mine . ' What 's that ? ' she 'd ask suspiciously . ' Parma ham . ' ' Ham ? Why are you covering the melon with it ? Should n't you save it for sandwiches ? ' Sometimes she said nothing at all , just opened her eyes in stunned gustatory orgasm and stared religiously at her daughter . ' Wow , ' she 'd finally say . ' Uh-huh , ' said her daughter . Her mother feared it was an oral thing . But for Jasmine it was the discipline . She had found great comfort in the rigid discipline of cooking . It was a food military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean up after yourself . Do your job well and you 're rewarded . Not a job everybody wants but , boy , they sure want somebody to be doing it . Jasmine was a food marine . She was proud of it . In those days , her heroes had been large men like Paul Bocuse , whose eyes twinkled above the sensuous slab of his ample cheeks , Jasmine herself was becoming a vast young woman . Oh , she was earth itself , flavor and richness and strength . At night she bathed to candles scented with vanilla and creamed palmfuls of olive oil into her rich dark skin , making sure to slide the grease over every patch . In the morning , she was as soft as silk and as fragrant as a Milanese trattoria . She piled her thick hair high on her head , letting the rowdier curls descend coquettishly around her face . She wore billowing white artist smocks and tied red or black bandannas at her throat Her legs held firm from her excess energy . Her full lips burnished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasmine ! ' ' What ? ' ' Are we out of OJ ? ' Jasmine sighed , cricked shut her laptop , and went down to join her husband . Daniel sat at the kitchen table , comparing the number of fiber gram on cereal boxes . Every morning he reread , recomputed , refigured the grams of fiber to the grams of salt and fat . He had become obsessed with eliminating . For Daniel eliminating had become tantamount of breathing . Fresh air and a fresh colon , that was his motto . His body was a battlefield between fiber and the raging toxins which hid like Vietcong in the jungle of his intestines . He would be Rambo , ferreting them out , garroting them mercilessly , his weapon of choice Fiber One , which scrubbed the walls of his gut like Ajax . Jasmine strolled into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator . ' Manuscript is off to Garrett 's today . Six months of testing , retesting , tasting , retasting . I must have eaten enough to feed a small nation She perused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a couple of aborted decisions she finally decided on a large slice of leftover tarte Tatin . She sat on a stool by the counter , too a big slurp of her steaming caf au lait , and tucked in . Daniel raised his eyes , ' Fiber One is the best : Jasmine shrugged . ' It tastes like sawdust . ' ' Maybe , but you never eat it , so what do you care ? ' ' I 'd hate you to spend the best years of your life eating sawdust . ' ' Why is this so difficult for you ? ' Jasmine 's eyes flicked over to him . ' You want Fiber One , I 'll get you Fiber One . ' ' Thank you . ' He poured his skim milk over the fiber-deficient cereal and began to crunch . He eyed Jasmine as she followed her last mouthful of tart around the plate with a spoon . She cut off its escape with her other hand and popped it into her impatient mouth . He watched as she sucked the life out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Daniel had first seen Jasmine at the American Caf in Georgetown seventeen years ago , he walked right into the wall . It was her way with the tarragon chicken croissant in her hands , her intense concentration , her closed , rapturous eyes , the large salad and double chocolate brownie at her table patiently waiting their turn . After salvaging his tray , he grabbed his veggie sandwich , overflowing with righteous sprouts , and sat as closely to her table as possible . He sipped his Perrier and watched while the vision before him sucked like a Hoover at her straw of Coke . She wetted her finger and dabbed at the flaky remains of her croissant . She took a deep , satisfied sigh and looked up , catching him staring at her , and smiled . He , with a mouthful of cucumber , tomato , avocado , and wholegrain bread , nodded back . She then actually smacked her lips and drew forth her salad . Daniel watched in amazement as she forked her lettuce into her mouth as economically as filling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to chew , grinning over at him , her eyes mere slits left in a face enlarged by two busy cheeks . Daniel noticed by now that he was not the only one who gawked . Whole tables chewed silently , breathlessly watching as Jasmine , her salad a mere memory , paused . She sat up straight and rolled her neck around to release any tension . She hiked up her shoulders to her ears one at a time as if getting ready for strenuous exercise . One last roll of her head and a beatific smile for the waitress who swerved by her table to grab her two exhausted plates Jasmine then reached for her dessert and drew it close . She gazed at it , contemplating the melting ice cream flowing down to moisten the side of the decadent chocolate brownie , the thinning line of chocolate sauce which pooled into the white cream before disappearing to the bottom of the plate . She picked up the fork , mumbled something Daniel did n't catch , and began to slide the bites of drenched brownie methodically into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes as he approached , licking her lips . Without a word he sat down before her . She chewed on her lower lip and said nothing . Daniel reached over and gently removed the fork from her hand . ' I hope you saved some for me , ' he said . She smiled , her teeth brown and white like a Jersey cow . Within a month he had it all : gourmet cook , maid , and sex slave . Well , maybe not sex slave , but she was certainly enthusiastic . The best thing about it was , it was all her idea . She 'd been staying with her mother and was bursting to get out . She extracted him from his group house and set them up in a reasonably priced one-bedroom apartment in Northwest . He could have done without the cheerleading cockroaches who watched him make toast every morning and the bathroom the size of a toupee , but other than that he could absolutely not complain . And the food . Oh , the food . Jesus , the food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so much garlic he could n't get near his boss for days . Fried calamari with a chili and honey sauce . Duck breast with sauted peaches . A beef stew with a sauce so good he wanted to rub it all over his body ; rich meaty , sweet , and oniony . One night , after a ragged afternoon at his day job , he walked into the apartment and smelled the breath of angels . Italian angels , sweet and pungent and herby with a splash of white wine , exuding a perfume that curled around his nose like a tickler . He strode to the kitchen to find seafood simmering in the pot over which Jasmine bent , swirling and sprinkling like a witch . Daniel was born again at that moment . Life gained meaning . The future sat up and beckoned . Marriage , a word he had never uttered without a twang of abject fear , became a gripping desire . Love , lust , and an incurable gluttony poured from him in the form of an unintelligible proposal , to which Jasmine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lips . Continues ...
