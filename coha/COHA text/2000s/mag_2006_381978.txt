His father became the shoemaker to the stars in Hollywood , but Ferruccio Ferragamo , Salvatore 's eldest son , was n't content just to dress the feet of American celebrities . During 22 years as ceo of Salvatore Ferragamo Italia , Ferruccio has developed the company into a global luxury brand that generates half its business in Asia . During a visit to Hong Kong , the exiting ceo talked to Time 's LING LIU about the company 's Eastern expansion . <P> Sales in Asia now make up half your revenues . How has this changed a company that made its name in Hollywood ? <P> Last night we were on a boat around the island , and I was amazed to see these beautiful buildings and people who are very efficient , very modern . You can breathe the air and see that the future is in Asia . We opened the first shop in China 12 years ago . It 's incredible what 's happened in 12 years . <P> Have your products changed to cater to the Asian market ? <P> Yes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . We made some adjustments maybe in the color , maybe in size . We have our people in Asia who come to Italy and work on merchandising . Ultimately , the customer decides , and you should always adapt . <P> Describe the difference between customers in China , your fastest-growing market , and Japan and Korea , where you 're established . <P> Japanese customers have been involved with fashion trends for more than 30 years . But in 10 years , China has grown faster , and today there is not much difference between what you find in China , Japan and Korea . <P> You still keep your entire manufacturing process in Italy . How do you stay competitive when so many of your competitors have moved to China ? <P> Very good question . If we produced in a cheaper market , we would make , short term , very big profit , but then we would question the quality , the continuity , the tradition and the " Made in Italy , " which I consider a second brand to go next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on margin , maintain high costs and think long term . On the other hand , I think some of our employees are a little spoiled . I work 12 hours a day , but our workers work less than eight . Now there is competition . Maybe we should all pull our sleeves up and work harder to support and maintain the know-how in Italy , because once it 's gone it 's gone . <P> Ferragamo has been family run for almost 80 years . Explain the recent decision to bring an outsider , former Valentino CEO Michele Norsa , on board as CEO of the company . <P> It 's very simple . Today we are 63 potential shareholders . I have six children ; we are six brothers and sisters from my father . Twenty-three grandchildren ; already there are grand-grandchildren of my father 's . First of all , we want a stronger company . The second point is to bring the company public . It has two advantages . The first is that everything you do is for the strength of the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders . They should be free to sell , to buy , whatever they want to do . If the company 's strong , the family will be strong . <P> Ferragamo designed custom shoes for celebrities like Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe . Which celebrity had the most unique feet ?
