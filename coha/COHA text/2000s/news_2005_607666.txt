<p> A week after failing to contain a quarterback making his fifth NFL start and a reserve receiver with only four previous catches , the Washington Redskins ' once-dominant defense will face a quarterback with Super Bowl experience and a five-time Pro Bowler who is considered one of the best receivers in the game . <p> Only two weeks ago , the Washington Redskins ranked first overall in the NFL against the pass , with the run defense conceding huge plays , but Philadelphia and , last week , Tampa Bay relied almost entirely on the passing game and attacked with considerable success . The Redskins ' next opponent , the Oakland Raiders ( 3-6 ) , is a franchise long enamored with the long ball under owner Al Davis and one even better equipped to give the cornerbacks and safeties fits Sunday at FedEx Field . <p> " We ca n't give up the big play , " Pro Bowl linebacker LaVar Arrington said . " That 's what we do , and we have to stop that . That 's got to be part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth in the league against the pass , may be without two of their premier defensive players again , with defensive tackle Cornelius Griffin , a key to the pass rush , and strong safety Sean Taylor , hindered by lingering injuries . Without them , Tampa Bay 's 21st-ranked passing game thrived , even without top receiver Michael Clayton . The Redskins must now adjust to an Oakland passing attack that is ranked sixth in the league and was buoyed by Randy Moss 's return to health last week . He is expected to start Sunday alongside receiver Jerry Porter , a Washington native . <p> Cracks in the pass defense had appeared against the Eagles , who lacked a running game and turned to quarterback Donovan McNabb , who threw for 304 yards , including a 56-yard touchdown to rookie receiver Reggie Brown , in Washington 's , 17-10 win . Similarly , the Buccaneers failed to muster a run of any consequence the following week , and were forced into repeated obvious passing situations , yet prospered despite the inexperience at their skill positions . <p> Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left the rest of the secondary undermanned , and the Buccaneers capitalized on those situations to win . <p> The Redskins remain ultra-aggressive under defensive coach Gregg Williams , but have slipped considerably with opponents adjusting to their schemes and scoring 36 points in two of the last three games . Washington has just 14 sacks through nine games ( only three teams have fewer ) , only four interceptions ( tied for third-worst in the NFL ) and seven takeaways , tied for worst overall . <p> The Redskins have a host of strong defensive linemen , but lack a dominant pass-rushing end and do not generate much pressure with a four-man rush . Generally , they need to involve linebackers and defensive backs to create pressure on the quarterback and Williams is at the vanguard of the league-wide trend of " fire-zone " blitzing , the very scheme that gave Washington 's offense so much trouble in 2004 . <p> Various players give the appearance that they will be leaving their position to attack the passer , but only some are actually doing so , with disguise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linemen and other players drop back into the zone the blitzer would normally fill , taking away the short-range passes most teams use to counter the blitz . But if the offense identifies the correct areas of attack , adjusts by using more tight ends and backs to block , deploys only a receiver or two and goes to a quick , three-step drop with the quarterback  --  as opponents have recently  --  then the Redskins are susceptible downfield , as the Tampa Bay game illustrated . <p> " You try to go within reason , " Coach Joe Gibbs said. , " and to make sure you 're doing smart things . And you take a long , hard look at a game like this and say , ' Okay , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ' But I think we need to stay aggressive , and I think we all want to be aggressive . " <p> Last season the Redskins confounded passers for the better part of 16 games , and offenses could not function against repeated cornerback and safety blitzes . Cornerback Shawn Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only defensive back in the NFL with that distinction  --  while the secondary totaled nine sacks overall ( 23 percent of the 40 overall sacks ) . This season , despite routine blitzing , the backfield does not have a sack , with teams bracing for the onslaught and capitalizing on it , in some cases . <p> " The blitz is designed to get there and when it does n't get there , you 're in trouble , " said defensive end Phillip Daniels . " Teams adjust on that . " <p> Tampa Bay quarterback Chris Simms had been sacked 11 times in his previous two games , looking confused with little time to make plays . Williams , who speaks to the media only on Thursdays , aimed to exploit that tendency , but the Redskins never sacked him . Simms altered his pre-snap routine to try to detect the origins of the oncoming assault , and passed for 279 yards and a career-best 119.8 passer rating , about 40 points higher than ever before . <p> " On film we saw them just come up and snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going into a cadence and when everybody comes up there and he sees blitz , then he throws it deep downfield . Maybe it 's because of all the big plays we gave up the weeks before , and they used that to their advantage . " <p> Springs attacked from the left side early in the game , leaving linebacker Marcus Washington and backup safety Pierson Prioleau ( who lacks Taylor 's speed ) in zone coverage with wide receiver Joey Galloway ; Galloway 's wide open 34-yard reception down the sideline set up the first score . " Early in the game , they blitzed a few times and we picked it up , " Simms said . " We made a few plays downfield and I think it scared them away for a little bit . " <p> But late in the third quarter , with the Buccaneers trailing 28-21 , Williams went for the kill . He blitzed on third and nine , leaving rookie cornerback Carlos Rogers to defend Edell Shepherd with no safety help , and Shepherd had a 46-yard catch on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were in an all-out blitz , " Rogers said , " and we were banking on them not having time to throw it . We 've got to tighten our coverage up , because at times we ca n't rely on the blitz getting there . " <p> Simms , a third-round pick in 2003 , and Shepherd , a third-year undrafted free agent , shared their greatest professional moment with 65 seconds left and the Buccaneers trailing 35-28 . The Redskins blitzed from the secondary again on second and 10 , leaving corner Walt Harris without support on Shepherd and the receiver got behind the defense once more for a 30-yard touchdown catch . <p> " It 's really tough , no matter who you are , " Harris said . " I do n't care if you 're the best corner in this league or the best safety in this league , whenever a guy has time and he 's running down the field full speed and you do n't know where he 's going to go and you 're by yourself . . . A perfect throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , really tough , to make that play . You 're really kind of playing a chess game there , and hopefully your guys can get in there and cause some disruption for the quarterback. "
