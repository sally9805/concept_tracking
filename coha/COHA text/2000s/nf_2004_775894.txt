School for Sabotage // ( April 11-30 ) // A chance to rehabilitate yourself , they had told him . A chance to fulfill your obligations to the Fatherland . // He had been ordered to report in uniform to the army post in Brandenburg , a slow two-hour train ride from Berlin 's Zoo station.1 Stations with names like Wannsee and Potsdam glided past his window as the train chugged westward , packed with soldiers returning home for a few days ' furlough with their families as a respite from the hell of the Russian front . From the train , the Prussian countryside seemed reassuringly permanent and serene , almost undisturbed by two and a half years of war , a collage of sparkling lakes , village churches with high steeples , children riding their bicycles down wooded lanes . // He took a streetcar from the station to the military garrison , whose old brick barracks dated back to the time of Kaiser Wilhelm . The regimental clerk took him to a storeroom , handed him a set of civilian clothes to put in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tramway to the end of the line . The farm was a ten-minute walk from the tram stop , along a road bordered by a drainage canal on one side and vegetable gardens on the other . The lakeside estate was impossible to miss , the clerk had insisted . There were no other farms in the vicinity . // He got off the streetcar as instructed , and walked up a country lane to a brick gatepost , beyond which he could see a two-story farmhouse at the end of a driveway lined by chestnut trees . Signs posted along the high metal fence warned intruders to " Keep out under penalty of severe punishment by the Law . " // As he wandered up the driveway , he caught glimpses of the lake shimmering through the woods . It was early spring : the chestnuts were not yet in bloom , but shoots of light green had appeared on the trees . Patches of snow still lay on the ground . To his left , he could see a converted two-story barn with a high sloping roof , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty yards from the lake , was neat and well maintained , reflecting the Prussian virtues of thrift , hard work , and order . // Several men were lounging on the porch of the brick building as he approached . He felt a little out of place . They were all in civilian clothes , while he was still in uniform . // " You must be Burger , " said one of the men , a wiry fellow with a thin face and a streak of gray running through his dark hair , as he extended his hand . " My name is Davis . George John Davis . " // A housekeeper showed him to a room , on the ground floor of the farmhouse , which he would share with one of the other men . After changing into the clothes the army clerk had given him in Brandenburg , he went outside to join his companions . The man who had introduced himself as Davis suggested they take a walk around the estate . // " You will be part of my group , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still half-frozen after a long , hard winter . " Eleven men have been chosen to take part in this course . Only the best will be selected to go to the United States . " // To outside appearances , Ernst Peter Burger had arrived at a working farm on the eastern shore of Lake Quenz . There was an apple orchard , a barnyard full of cows , pigs , and chickens , and a hothouse where vegetables were grown . Between the main building and the road , just north of the driveway , was a one-story house occupied by the people who looked after the farm . There were even a few children running around . But it did not take Burger long to discover that nothing was what it seemed at Quenz Lake . // In the first place , his new acquaintance 's name was not Davis at all , but George John Dasch . Like Burger , Dasch was a German-American who had returned to the Fatherland to take part in Hitler 's great experiment . Davis was merely the code name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked around the lakeside estate with Dasch , it became clear to him that it was not a farm at all . The barnlike building he had noticed as he came up the drive contained a classroom and a chemical laboratory above a garage . Next door was a gymnasium equipped with parallel bars and weight-lifting equipment . Beyond these buildings , on the other side of a bridge leading across a pond , was an area that looked like an abandoned movie set . It included a hundred yards of railway tracks leading nowhere , an observation tower , and a deserted house , pockmarked with bullet holes and traces of explosives . Next to the railroad tracks , bulldozers had torn a large hole in the ground . The pit was reinforced with concrete and was evidently used for setting off high explosives . At the southernmost end of the estate , beyond the explosives pit , was a shooting range . // The meaning of all this was still a puzzle for Burger . He had volunteered for intelligence work in America , for which he believed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the United States , he had learned good English , even though he retained a strong German accent . He felt comfortable among Americans . He had received an honorable discharge from the Michigan National Guard , and had become an American citizen . With his swarthy complexion and slightly elongated nose , he could pass himself off as a Jewish refugee . But how he would get to America-and what he would do once he got there-remained unclear . // The mystery unraveled as he talked to Dasch , who explained that Burger was the last of eleven students to arrive at the farm . Over the next three weeks , they would learn how to blow up factories . They would then be sent to America by submarine in two groups , landing somewhere along the eastern coast . Was he still interested ? // Burger barely hesitated . Yes , of course , he was still interested . // They ate dinner on the ground floor of the farmhouse , in a large room overlooking the lake . They then set off through the woods for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour to reach the place , and once again Burger found himself walking with Dasch , who began quizzing him about his past . Since Dasch was going to be his new chief , Burger thought it better to admit he had been in trouble with the Gestapo . To his relief , Dasch said he was already aware of that . He had studied the files . // " Tell me your side of the story . The other side I know . " // There was so much to tell that Burger scarcely knew where to begin . He was thirty-six years old , and his life had been in turmoil since his return to Germany from America nine years previously . Readmission to the Nazi Party . The elation of rejoining the storm troopers and taking part in Hitler 's triumphant parades . The Night of the Long Knives . Clashes between the storm troopers and the S.S. Trips to Czechoslovakia and Poland . Marriage . A trumped-up charge . Imprisonment . His wife 's miscarriage . Release from jail . // Burger found it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation . He began to curse Heinrich Himmler , the head of the Gestapo , and " the dirty bastards who beat me up . " Dasch cut him short . // " That 's enough . Do n't say anything more . We 'll talk about this later . " // They changed the subject . A slip like that could have serious consequences . To Dasch , Burger seemed suddenly fearful , " a man haunted by a terrible past , happy and elated one minute and given to moody spells and silence the next . " // Despite the secrecy that surrounded the Quenz Lake camp , little effort was made to hide the identity of the school . Burger was surprised to hear his fellow trainees chatting in English when they visited the local tavern or took walks in the countryside , even though Germany and America had been at war with each other for the past five months , ever since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . They would often burst into songs like " Oh ! Susannah " and even " The Star-Spangled Banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . // The fact was that the people of Brandenburg-like the people of any small German town-had lost all sense of curiosity after a decade of Nazi rule . They had learned to keep their heads down , refusing to notice the most outrageous things that were being done in their name . On Sunday , April 12 , the day after Burger passed through Brandenburg on his way to Quenz Lake , the remnants of the town 's Jewish population were herded to the train station by half a dozen Prussian gendarmes on the first stage of a journey to the Warsaw Ghetto . As several dozen Jewish families trudged through the town in their heavy winter overcoats , hauling bags crammed with their possessions , local people simply averted their gaze . // It was not just Germans who preferred to ignore what was happening around them . Beginning in 1940 , the local Opel plant , a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors , had been using slave labor from conquered German territories to replace workers conscripted into the Wehrmacht . Every day , thousands of Poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brandenburg in long columns to the Opel factory , where they worked fourteen hours a day for starvation wages . Although the American managers knew all about the use of slave labor in their Brandenburg plant , they made no effort to divest themselves of their German holdings , and acted as if nothing were amiss . // It was hardly surprising , then , that nobody would pay much attention when , as Nazi Germany geared up for war in 1939 , the country estate of a wealthy Jewish shoe manufacturer on the edge of town was turned over to the Abwehr and transformed into a training camp for saboteurs. // In order to get his chance at rehabilitation , Burger had called in his Nazi Party connections , ties that dated back to his experiences as a street brawler before and after the Munich beer hall putsch of 1923 . The coup had been quashed , and Hitler sent to prison , but in retrospect it marked the first big step on the F ? hrer 's road to supreme power . The putsch had become part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion was a mark of distinction that nobody could ever take away from you . None of the other men , Burger felt sure , could match his knowledge of the inner workings of the Nazi movement . // After his release from jail in July 1941 , he had wangled an appointment with Alfred Rosenberg , the party ideologist , and had mentioned his interest in foreign intelligence work . Rosenberg had picked up the phone and called Admiral Canaris , the head of the Abwehr . Canaris passed the message on to a Colonel Schmidt , who introduced Burger to a Lieutenant Colonel Marguerre . The lieutenant colonel called a Major Hotzel , who sent Burger to see a Captain Astor , who in turn introduced him to Lieutenant Walter Kappe. // Kappe , Burger learned , was a former editor of German-language newspapers in Chicago and New York . He had also been a high official in the German-American Bund . Some of the other men at the camp had heard Kappe speak at meetings in Chicago , railing against the Jews and urging his audience to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jovial , with an eye for the ladies , Kappe was not the kind of man you easily forgot . His flabby face was very distinctive , " a real baby face . " According to an unflattering portrait in the files of the American FBI , he spoke English with a strong German accent , which he tried to hide " under an atrocious and unsuccessfully affected phony Oxford accent . . . Kappe likes to play the suave , imperturbable superman but can easily be made to lose his cool . " // Kappe had personally screened all the men selected for training at the sabotage school , and had arranged their transfers to Quenz Lake . In Burger 's case , Kappe had questioned him extensively about his experiences in the United States . Satisfied with his answers , Kappe made arrangements for Burger to be transferred from guarding a prison camp outside Berlin to a secret military unit known as the Lehrregiment that trained espionage and sabotage agents for the German High Command . The Brandenburg garrison , where Burger was ordered to report en route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burger arrived at the farm on Saturday , April 11 . Since classes were not scheduled to begin until Monday , he devoted the rest of the weekend to getting to know his fellow trainees . They spent much of Sunday lounging around the living room of the main farmhouse , perusing various American newspapers and magazines long banned in Germany , such as the New York Times , Life , and the Saturday Evening Post . The publications , most of which were about two months old , were stamped " Property of OKW , to be returned . " 14 OKW , Burger knew , stood for Oberkommando der Wehrmacht , the German High Command . There were also reading materials in Hindi , Arabic , and various other languages . // The other trainees were all German-Americans who had spent varying amounts of time in the United States . Some spoke good English ; others retained a thick German accent . Most had worked in menial occupations in America , such as cook , housepainter , chauffeur , odd-job man . They ranged in age from early twenties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty-nine years old , very loquacious , and full of nervous energy . Before returning to Germany in May 1941 , he had spent nearly twenty years in America , where he held a variety of jobs , including waiter , traveling salesman , and manager of a brothel . His English was a little rusty , but he had an extraordinary command of American slang , and would sprinkle his conversation with expressions that seemed to be lifted out of a Boy 's Own magazine , such as " check and recheck , " " scram , " and " blow my stack . " He referred to his brain as his " noodle " and people he disliked as " a bunch of nuts . " Once he began to talk , it was difficult to get him to stop . Burger noticed that Dasch had the habit of waving his long , gangly arms while talking to people and holding his index finger up to his nose , as if to preempt anyone who might try to interrupt him . Dasch had been selected to lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The leader of the second group was Edward Kerling , alias Eddie Kelly , a heavy-jawed man with thick wavy hair who always seemed to be smiling . Kerling dropped hints that he was a Nazi Party member of long standing , with a membership number of around 70000 , indicating that he , like Burger , was one of Hitler 's early followers.15 He had lived in America for eleven years , and had had quite an adventure getting back to Germany . In 1939 , after Hitler invaded Poland , Kerling and a few friends pooled their savings to buy a small yacht , the Lekala , with the intention of sailing across the Atlantic and offering their services to the Fatherland . But the boat was intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard , triggering a spate of newspaper headlines about American Nazis making illegal trips to Germany and violating the Neutrality Act . //
