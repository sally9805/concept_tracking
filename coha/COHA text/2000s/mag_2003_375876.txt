A study of heart-attack patients in Denmark suggests that emergency angioplasties work so much better than anticlotting drugs that the wait for a hospital transfer is often worthwhile . The study , reported in the New England Journal of Medicine , followed 1,129 patients . Of those treated with the drugs , 14% died or had another heart attack or a disabling stroke . The figure was 8% for those transferred within 2 hours to a different hospital for angioplasty.
