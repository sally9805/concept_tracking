England From the deposition of Mrs. James Tarleton to the Joint Representatives of the British Ministry of Magic , the War Office , and the Foreign Office I suppose that if I were going to blame our involvement on anyone ( which I see no reason to do ) , I would be compelled to say that it was all Aunt Charlotte 's fault . If she had not been in such a dreadful temper over Kate 's marriage , Kate and Thomas would not have decided to take their wedding journey on the Continent in preference to remaining in England , and James and I would not have gone with them . And then very likely we would never have known anything about any of it . Kate is my cousin , and now that she is married she is a Marchioness , which is what put our Aunt Charlotte 's nose so dreadfully out of joint . Admittedly , Kate said some awful things to Aunt Charlotte , but after the way Aunt Charlotte treated Kate , she deserved every one of them . She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out as she , because Kate was going to be Lady Schofield and I was only going to be Mrs. Tarleton . So it is her own fault that none of us wished to stay and listen to her nagging . At first James was dubious about our joining Kate and Thomas on their wedding journey , though he and Thomas are nearly as great friends as Kate and I. I felt compelled to point out that even if we did not accompany them , they would have Lady Sylvia traveling with them at least until they reached Paris . " And if Kate does not object to having her mama-at-law with them , you ought not to be such a high stickler about our going as well . Besides , she and Thomas invited us . " " You mean you cooked up the idea and talked Kate intoit , and she persuaded Thomas , " James said . " Sometimes you go too far , Cecy . " " I did not ! " I said hotly . Which is not to say that I would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw no reason to mention that to James . " Kate came to me , I promise you , and it was Thomas 's idea , not hers . " " Thomas wants us on his wedding journey ? " " It 's our wedding journey , too , " I pointed out , feeling rather annoyed . " And I believe he thinks he is doing us a favor . " " A favor ? " " Aunt Charlotte , " I said succinctly . " I am perfectly capable of handling- " James broke off suddenly , looking rather thoughtful . " You 're right , " he said after a moment . " That does sound like Thomas . " " If you are quite determined , I can tell Kate to tell Thomas that we have other plans , " I said . " But since he already knows perfectly well that we haven't- " " No , no , I 'll talk to him , " James said hastily . He turned away , muttering something about keeping me out of it , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Thomas , and they ended up in some gaming hell or other and were odiously drunk . ( Or so my brother , Oliver , informed me . He was quite scathing about it , until I inquired very sweetly how he had happened to be there to see . ) And when I saw James late the next day , he had agreed that when Kate and Thomas and Lady Sylvia left London , we would go along with them . James made a point of asking who was making the arrangements , and he seemed quite relieved to hear that Lady Sylvia was managing it all . I gather that he does not entirely trust Thomas 's skills in that regard . Naturally , Aunt Charlotte made a number of shocked and uncomplimentary remarks when she discovered what we were planning . As it was none of her affair , James and I ignored her . After all , Aunt Elizabeth did not see anything amiss about it , and she is at least as high a stickler as Aunt Charlotte . ( Well , actually , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey together was the oddest thing the four of us ever did , Aunt Charlotte should be grateful . ) Papa , of course , was delighted , and gave Kate and me each a long list of antiquities that he said we must see ( most of them quite unsuitable , but I dare say that did n't occur to him ) . The wedding was rather small , as we held it barely three weeks after the announcements appeared , but it was most elegant . James and Thomas stood up for each other , and Kate and I were each other 's maids of honor , and Papa gave both of us away , since Kate 's Papa has been dead these five years . I must confess that at the time I somewhat regretted the haste and the quietness of the ceremony , but I would have gone to much greater lengths in order to be married along with dear Kate . Upon reflection , however , I see that it was a very good thing we were so quick about matters . If we had waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kate again , and then she would certainly have tried to bully Kate into wearing a wedding gown identical to mine ( which was Brussels lace over cream satin ) , and it would not have done at all . Kate is far too short to look well in the styles I wear , but she was perfectly stunning in the white silk brocade that she and I and Lady Sylvia picked out . Kate was a little nervous before the ceremony started ; I believe she was afraid she would trip while she was walking up the aisle , or become entangled in her veil , or tear the hem out of her gown . Nothing of the sort happened , and I am quite sure she forgot to worry as soon as she saw Thomas waiting for her . She looked very happy indeed , and positively floated down the aisle . I am afraid I did n't pay too much attention to Kate after that , because it was my turn to walk up the aisle and I was looking at James . The wedding breakfast afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor Aunt Charlotte could find anything to turn up their noses about , but none of us wished to linger . Finally , a footman came to say that the carriages were at the door , and we said our good-byes . Aunt Elizabeth hugged us both and gave us each a pair of pearl earrings , which she had enchanted so that they would never fall out or get lost . Papa ( who was beginning to look vaguely rumpled already ) gave me a bottle of brandy ( in case any of us should be carriage-sick ) and another list of antiquities he had forgotten to include the first time . Oliver , to my complete astonishment , gave me a hug that did severe damage to his cravat and promised James and me one of Thunder 's foals . Aunt Charlotte sniffed and said she hoped none of us would regret it , and then presented Kate and me with identical boxes of starched linen handkerchiefs . Kate immediately found a use for one ; her sister , Georgina ( who has always been something of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Kate was too kind to let her continue dabbing at her eyelashes with a soggy ball . We escaped at last , climbed into our carriages , and started off . Lady Sylvia travels in the first style of elegance . She had a carriage for herself ( I thought it was out of kindness , to keep from invading the privacy of the newlyweds , but Kate told me later that her carriage is specially sprung ) , one for each couple , two more for the servants , and a sixth that was completely filled with baggage ( most of it Lady Sylvia 's , as Kate and I had not had sufficient time to assemble much in the way of bride-clothes ) . Most of the servants were Lady Sylvia 's , too . James had brought his valet and Thomas had brought a man named Piers , who he said filled the same office , but neither Kate nor I had had the opportunity to engage a maid . Lady Sylvia seemed to think that we would do far better to wait until we reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we saw no reason whatever to disagree with her . Lady Sylvia was eager to return to France , so instead of taking the journey in easy stages , we went straight to Dover . Despite all her planning , we were not able to board a packet that night ; the winds were against us , and no boats could cross the Channel until they changed . So we spent the night at a small inn in Dover . ( Kate was quite thoroughly taken aback when the proprietor addressed her as " Lady Schofield . " ) The following morning the wind had changed , so after Thomas and James finished arguing about who was to settle up at the inn ( each of them insisted on paying the whole himself ) , we all went down to the docks . It was cloudy and looked as if it might rain at any moment , but there was a good stiff breeze blowing and the captain of the packet assured us that we would have a quick and easy passage to Calais . If what we had was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sure that I wish to return to England until someone invents a spell to whisk people across the Channel without benefit of boats . We were barely under way when I began to feel a bit peculiar . I decided to go and lie down in our cabin , but it did not answer ; I was most vilely unwell for nearly the whole of the crossing . James came in at least once , looking worried , but of course there was nothing he could do . I heard him a few moments later , talking to Thomas outside the cabin . " Do n't fret , " Thomas told him , in what I thought was a most unfeeling tone . " Nobody ever dies of seasickness ; they only wish they would . " Kate came by just then and made them go away . A little later she returned with a cup half full of something dark and strong-smelling . " Lady Sylvia made this , " she told me . " She says it will do you good . " " If you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to me of swallowing anything , " I replied . " If I have to take it away , I shall probably spill it , and someone will slip in it and break a leg , " Kate declared . " You had better drink it . " " You have n't spilt anything in ages , " I told her . " Not since you and Thomas finally settled things between you . " But I drank it anyway , because Kate can be very persistent . It was not nearly as nasty as it looked , and it did help . On her way out of the cabin , Kate tripped over the doorsill , just to prove I was wrong about her spilling things . Lady Sylvia 's potion sent me off to sleep , and when I woke up the boat did not seem to be tossing about quite so much . I was just wondering whether perhaps I might dare to try standing up , when the door of the cabin opened and James came in . " We 've arrived , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore ? " " For solid ground under my feet , I can do anything , " I said fervently , and swung my feet out of the bunk . My head swam a little , but not enough to stop me . It was only when I reached the deck that I realized my ordeal was not yet over . Despite the multitude of travelers coming to France of late , no one had yet built docks in Calais suitable for receiving them . Instead , the packet stopped some way out from land , and we disembarked into smaller boats to be rowed ashore . A crowd of workingmen waited on the beach . I thought they meant to carry our luggage , but when I mentioned this , Lady Sylvia said , " They will do that , certainly , but their first duty is to carry us . " " What ? " Kate said , alarmed , but just then the boat must have reached some crucial point , for the men surged forward into the sea . They surrounded the rowing boat , shouting incomprehensibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia rose immediately , stepped up on the seat of the rowboat , and with considerable aplomb seated herself on the shoulders of two of the men . She was borne off immediately , and the rest of us did our best to follow her example , with varying degrees of success . Soon we were deposited onshore , most of us only slightly damp from the sea spray and none the worse for wear ( though Kate had somehow contrived to become soaked to the waist , despite Thomas 's care in selecting two of the huskiest porters to carry her ashore ) . The sun was shining out of a clear , blue sky . We were in France .
