The couple will wed at the groom 's family home in Newport , Rhode Island next June .

The groom , twenty-seven , graduated from Harvard and the Sorbonne , and is an art director at the same firm , which is where the couple met . The bride 's stepfather is the senior partner of the law firm McCovney , Lewis &; Brown , in East Orange . The bride 's mother is the head of social work at the Newark Emergency Services for Children . The bridegroom 's father is a private investor . The bridegroom 's mother is a painter . The bridegroom 's great-grandfather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Company ; his grandfather , Granger William Fitzhugh , was CEO . The groom 's maternal great-grandfather founded Mercantile Steel . Geneva sighed and neatly folded a copy of the hometown newspaper , placing it on the kitchen table so that Mabel , the lady who comes twice a week to tidy things up a bit , could see the announcement . Baby girl getting married , Mabel would say . Seems like just yesterday she was runnin ' through this house wit ' me yellin ' after her to slow down . Always was in a rush . That little girl was someum ' else . Marrying a White boy , a rich White boy . You go ' head , Miss I-esh-a . Miss Geneva can die a happy woman now -- her grandbaby finally doing it right , she 'd say , always emphasizing the I sound at the beginning of her name , I-e-sha , driving Geneva crazy in the process . The phones started ringing , as Geneva knew they would once the news landed in the Beacon-Herald . " Yes , Pearl , that 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , seems like we just had her christened . " " Yes , I 'm very pleased . He 's a very nice young man , comes from a very respectable family . " " Well , I know , you seeing more and more of it these days . The girls say there just are n't that many of our men to go around , you know , who are going on , finishing their education and stretching themselves . " " Yes , I suppose you 're right . It 's a different world . " " Alright now , mmmm , and thank you for calling . Yes , see you at church . " " ' Bye now . " She hung up her kitchen wall phone . There was still a lot to be done . Camille is so lackadaisical . You have to stay on her about every detail . She was supposed to start calling florists to get estimates . She gets so caught up with her so-called clients and tryin ' to save the world , she 'd forget her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have all that hair and mess everywhere . Geneva exhaled in exasperation , as she 'd been doing for most of Camille 's forty-five years . She took a last sip of tea and put the cup in the sink , turned on the water and swirled it around the ring in the cup . At seventy she had more energy than many twenty years younger . " Ew , look at the time , " she said to no one . " I 'm going to be late for service . " Geneva would not be late ; she never was , for anything . What she would be was not early . She 'd already laid out what she was going to wear  --  her coral suit , matching hat , beige pumps , hose and purse . She was alone now in the high ranch she and her late husband , Major , had bought with an eye toward their twilight years . Now , the wide halls and spacious rooms were too much for just one person , but she could n't bring herself to part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell Major 's aftershave in the master bath and the smell comforted her , just the way she liked  --  in private . Geneva wheeled her late model Buick around the church parking lot , mumbling curse words because her usual parking space was taken , as were all the choice spots . And to add insult , she did n't even know the offender . Used to be time when she knew everybody who was a member of First Presbyterian , but now they got all kinds of new people coming in , driving these awful trucks , vans , SUBs , whatever they 're called , taking up two spaces . It 's just abominable . Camille and Lem of course had one and had the nerve to be a Cadillac  --  it 's just foolishness . Geneva ended up having to park on the street . Walking up to the church , seeing it from the front , she was struck by how beautiful the architecture was and for a moment she felt sad that Aisha would n't be getting married there . It would be nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Camille killed that idea a long time ago , going and getting herself in trouble like some common ... The sedate organ music took Geneva 's mind off her daughter for a while and she smiled as she walked down the aisle to her seat in the third pew , right aisle . She mouthed thank-yous to the ladies who wordlessly complimented her hat , and sat down . Marjorie Blessitt sang " How Blessed Thou Art " and Geneva let the music soothe her soul .
