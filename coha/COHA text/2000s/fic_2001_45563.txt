You can read more about his most recent book in Rob Killheffer 's book column this month . Mr. Wolfe 's latest story for us is a subtle tale of alien life . <p> WE DINED LAST NIGHT before seven skun of natives who had built a stone table for us . They heaped it with wood , set the wood ablaze , and cooked our food by throwing it into the fire . We pulled out the parts we wanted and in the end ate nearly all of it , though it was scorched here and raw there . ( The hard , white parts are rich in calcium . ) How is it that we can eat their food when it is not vegetable in origin ? I must ask the others . They revere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They speak for a very long time when they have begun ( and do not like to be interrupted ) , saying the same things over and over in the same words , or at times with changes in the wording . They want us to be kind to them , to destroy their enemies , and to make their crops grow . It seems senseless to me , and I do not believe the others understand better than I. Why should we be kind to them when they are unkind to each other ? If we are to understand them - and they , us - we must act as they . So much is manifest . Are not their enemies in no regard different from themselves ? If we were to destroy these natives instead , the same result would ensue with less difficulty and less chance of error . I may propose it . Of what benefit are the crops to them ? This place swarms with food untended . The desert people , who grow none , eat as well as they and with less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage their own gluttony . If there is another result , it can be but small . When they had sung and talked and sung and talked until they and we were tired , we spoke together for a time almost sensibly . We told them something of our home , and though we told them very little it was more than they could understand . Our long voyage through space impressed them . I doubt they grasped its length , for their concepts of the five they call " time " are muddled , and so erroneous that they can not be termed primitive with any precision . They will be primitive , perhaps , when sunlight reaches them on this place . Someone told them that I was in the scout first sent from our ship . That impressed them too , although they can have had little notion what my mission was or why I chose to perform it . They asked many questions , of which a few were sensible . They could not understand ( I cite an example where I might cite many ) why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there are two they must often look at each other and not at the place they have been sent to see , and that three will be worse than two , and four worse than three . That those in a crowd see nothing , save its other members . Some may be acute observers . Often some are . But they will observe ( acutely ) those before and behind , and to one side and the other , and the crowd as a whole will always see less than any member has . I told them how I had landed in the desert lands . I was unable to control my loquacity once I had begun and tried to tell them how those lands had appeared to me . The wind that was never still , and the sand that whispered and whispered under my foot , speaking of great trees and . beasts , and fair meadows that had vanished only a moment before we came . The flaming lights that filled the night sky , the cold of night and the heat of day . Cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water that seemed not so far away that a shout might not reach them , but vanished too as I approached them on my machine . No matter how swiftly I rode . They nodded , as I had expected , and looked at one another ; but they did not understand . Less even than those who share our ship did they understand me . Perhaps I said also how lonely a place the desert is . Perhaps it was my saying it that prompted them to ask why no one had come with me . That would be logical and so must be true - or as the pedants would have it , must be accepted as true until the truth be found . Was it for truth 's sake that I rode across the desert ? Was it for truth 's sake that I pursued my melting cities and the lakes that evaporated as I approached them ? Inarguably . Across that desert - I will never forget it , and because I will not , I will never forget this place , which the large subspecies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rode for truth , rising before their star and riding onward , always on so long as I could be certain my way was clear , after it had fallen beneath the horizon . In that desert the horizon is larger than a place of this size can produce . I think it clear that this place is not a true sphere ( though most are ) but has a flat spot : its desert . I must mention this to the others . Some may agree . If it is so , the level desert must appear to one near its center to rise all around , so that he moves only with augmented effort in every direction , since each step carries him farther from the center . Walking upon level ground , he nonetheless ascends its gravity pit . A flat pit , this , which tires and bewilders . That is exactly how it seemed to me , and if my theory does not embrace the physical facts ( though I am sure it does ) it embraces the subjective ones . This in itself may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some discipline . The beauty of this is that it carries its own confirmation . It ravishes me . When I had begun to tell of my time alone , some of the others tried to explain what knowledge is , and how it is to be valued . The natives could not understand , saying again and again in many different ways that knowledge is a thing one uses . We sought to explain by the Great Disciplines that such things have nothing to do with its value . We spoke much of our ship , because they themselves had spoken of it again and again , saying ( with many voices that our great knowledge had permitted us to build it . That is so , but who would labor to gain knowledge for such a purpose ? It is the interior change that suffices , the transformation that rewards . I know that you know this , but they could not understand . At last I spoke again of the desert . Not because I felt I could add to their understanding , but because I myself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they possessed , and undergo many interior changes by its power , before they themselves could understand . The little ones with tails would never . Of that I am certain . But the larger subspecies may , in time . It is not easy for me to speak of the desert . Still less easy is it for me to scribe it as I do . There is so much that might be said ; and yet no one who reads this will have understanding of the desert . Not even those who share this ship with me have it . One must go . I say again : one must go . I went . Perhaps there can be too much understanding . I have so much now , and that is why I will never forget this place . My companions understand nothing of that . The whisper of the sands , and the night silence when the sands no longer spoke . Although I had homeair , I found it difficult to breathe when the sands fell silent . Yet the homeair never failed me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead and not he . So much failed me . My companions first of all . The people of this place were correct tonight . One must not see too much , and never is that more true than it is when sight shows only how little there is to be seen . The emptiness . The sand , mountains of sand that move like water animals . The black rocks , uncovered by the wind . Covered by the wind . Uncovered by the wind once again . The wind itself , a thing that spins and strides . My navigator failed . I do not mean that it would no longer indicate a direction for the scout that had carried me down . It did . I rode and rode . I would sleep on the couch , I told myself . I would eat from the little coldcloset under the work flat . At last , when I was so weary that I feared I would strike a rock and fall , I stopped and ate the last of the food I had carried , and slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I woke the navigator indicated a direction for the scout indeed , but it was a new direction . My machine no longer pointed as the navigator pointed . They had come for me , I thought . They had come for me , and for some reason - no doubt for the best of reasons - they had moved the scout to a new location . To a better landing place , and a place nearer me than the place where I had at first landed , for the distance was very short now . I rode as the navigator directed , and the distance increased . When I rode as I had the previous day , it increased also . I endeavored to find a direction in which it would decrease , and the direction indicated by my navigator changed again . Of the next days , I will not speak . On the third , I found a person of this place . My reflector deceived him , and he made the beast he rode halt for me and lie upon the sand . He gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the useless navigator , my machine broken when it collided with a stone . He told me where he was going . I begged to accompany him , for he had water . That night we camped at a spring , a tiny place but very beautiful , where plants grew green . Dried fruits were his food , with another food like small stones that grew soft when boiled . I could eat none of it , but was glad to see him eat of it , for I knew I would perish if he died . He told stories of desert spirits that night , stories filled with knowledge though none were true . I heard him in awe , and begged that he speak on , until at last it came to me that he believed me one . I turned off my reflector then , and he abased himself . Eight days we searched the desert for my scout and found it on the ninth . I leaped from the back of his beast and would have run to it ahead of him ; but he lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near death , and we arrived together . I had promised him that he would live forever if we found my scout . This I told tonight to those who had burned beasts on the stone table for us , at which their eyes grew wide . He would be taller than other men , I had promised , and stronger than the beast he rode . He had believed me , and the others , tonight , believed me too . For a time at least . The truth is that I believed it myself . In the scout I would be able to correct or alter my own nucleic acids . The tiny machines I inserted beneath my skin for that purpose could , I thought , be inserted beneath his also . So inserted , they would achieve the changes I directed . There in the desert it had seemed so easy . He questioned me once more when we reached the scout . How hard he tried to ingratiate himself ! How many times he touched his face to the sand ! I would not cheat him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , who had saved my life in the desert . He waited for me to assert ( I could see this ) that he had not . But it was true , and I acknowledged it . The natives who fed us nodded to themselves when I recounted this . The larger sort cover their faces with hair as he did . They remind me of him , and the memory is not wholly unpleasant . How much I learned from him ! I pledged myself again and I took his body fluid . Have I already scribed this ? I repeated all the promises I had made before . Better , more , and stronger , for I was starved and shrunken then and feared he would prevent me from boarding the scout . He sensed it , for he severed the head of his beast , and we cooked its flesh and ate it before I went into the scout . I had explained that he could not breathe inside , and I let him stand by me when I opened the lock . He coughed and backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of so many empty days . It was a triumph , and I inspected every part of the scout glorying , and tested every instrument in every possible way , recalling my navigator . They functioned without a flaw , all of them . I was ecstatic . And then , having grown so greatly in my own estimation , I attempted to reprogram the tiny machines . I would make my promises turn to truths . The natives who had fed us grew restless when I spoke of this , and looked one to another . They are strange creatures , too simple for their own good ; but because they are very simple , it is not easy to guess what they think or what they feel . Their thoughts will be simple thoughts , but without logic and without knowledge . Who can say where they will run ? Their feelings know no truth . It could not be done . I told them so again and again , that they might understand . For three days I labored , though by the third I knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ( this I made as plain as I could ) , I restarted the engines and returned to this ship . He , waiting for the promises that could never come , died swiftly and in glory like their star . I repeated it many times and in many ways , and it seemed to me they understood .
