Chapter One BEGIN ON THE NIGHT that my old life ended . Begin on a warm April evening with a rumpled thirty-nine-year-old man stepping out of his cab at Park Avenue and Seventy-seventh . Manhattan steams and rumbles around him . He needs food , he wants sex , he must have sleep , and he 'd prefer them in that order . The cab speeds off . The time is 1 a.m. , and he looks up at his apartment building with a heavy , encyclopedic exhalation , which in its lung depth and audible huh can be found his whole life-wish and dream , sadness and joy , victory and loss . Yes , his whole life swirls in that one wet breath-as it does in everyone 's . The idea was for him to get home in time for his son 's birthday party , as a surprise . Even his wife is n't expecting him . But his plane was delayed leaving San Francisco , circled LaGuardia endlessly , and then the traffic into the city was slow , even at that hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off-peak tractor-trailers , limos from hell . Now , planted on the pavement with his suitcase , our man loosens his red silk tie and top shirt button . He 's tired of such constriction , though addicted to its rewards . And has he not been rewarded ? Why , yes , of course-bonuses and dividends and compound interest and three-for-one splits . And does he not expect many more such rewards-semiannual wifely blow jobs , prompt service at the dry cleaner 's , his secretary 's unhesitating agreement to do whatever he asks ? Yes , how could he not ? He 's worked for all these things . He 's a successful lawyer , our lawyer . My lawyer . My own lost self . He 's been with his firm for fourteen years , made partner long ago . His client list includes a major major bank ( run by dragons in suits , minority-owned by the House of Saud , accountable to no one ) , several real estate developers ( testicle-munching madmen ) , a television network ( puppets dangled by puppets ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He can handle these people . He 's a man of brisk phone calls and efficient business lunches and clean paperwork . Dependable , but not a killer . Or rather , apparently not a killer . Not a screamer or a power-drinker or a deal-popper-no doors get blown off when he goes by , the secretaries do n't look up . In fact , he should be a little flashier , but probably could n't quite pull it off . His hair is too thin , his waist one Sunday Times too thick . On the third hand , the world runs on dependable , unflashy people like him and he knows it . People feel comfortable with him . The law firm feels comfortable . So he feels only somewhat uncomfortable , only a bit replaceable . He understands that it 's going to be a slow climb . Five years long for every big one up . He sees the middle passage looming , the gray hair , the stiffness in the knees , the cholesterol pills . But not yet , quite . Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably involves golf and a boat and the urologist , and this is acceptable , almost . If there 's a streak of fatalism in him , he keeps it under control . He wishes for many things and knows he 'll get only a few . He wishes he were taller , richer , slimmer , and had screwed many more girls before getting married . His wife , Judith , who is five years younger , is quite lovely . He wishes , however , that she was just a little nicer to him . She knows that she 's still quite lovely , for a while at least , until-as she has announced many times-she gets her mother 's neck . ( Will it be a softly bloated horror , or an udder of empty skin ? He does n't know ; there 's a family history of cosmetic surgery . ) Meanwhile , he 's been faithful and a good provider and even changed a few diapers when their son was young . Steady-the same guy year in and year out . Judith , however , believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has cycled through shiatsu , aromatherapy , yoga , Lord knows what . Wanting something , something else . Seems frustrated , even by her own orgasms . Wants , wants more . More what ? Do n't he and Judith have quite enough ? Of course not . But such desire is dangerous . Thus the constant reinvention . He does n't understand how that can be done ; you are who you are , he believes , and that 's it . He 'd like to reinvent his paycheck , however . He 's paid a lot . But he 's worth more . The old senior partners , amused and goatish , padding along the hallways , suck out more money than they bring in . Though he and Judith live in one of those apartment buildings where a silver-haired doorman greets every resident by name , he wishes that he were paid better-eighty percent would do-for Judith wants another child soon . And kids in New York City are expensive , totems of major money . The ability to project a couple of children through infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music lessons , and summer camps while living in Manhattan requires a constant stream of after-tax cash . It 's not just the cost of education and supervision ; it 's the protection , the cushioning . The city 's children were traumatized enough by the World Trade Center attack . They do n't need to see all the panhandlers with seeping sores , the crazies and subway-shitters . You hope to keep them segregated and supervised . Not loitering or dawdling or drifting , because to linger along the path home is to invite bad possibilities . The child snatcher , the pervert , the mob of taunting adolescents wielding box cutters . In Manhattan all monsters are proximate , if not by geography , then by imagination . And the contours of the imagination are changed by money . The units of luxury get larger . And this lawyer , this man , my own man , this hairless ape in a size 44 suit , knows it . You eat what you kill , he tells himself . Kill more and you 'll eat more . Another child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping Selma , their baby-sitter , on for a few more years . He 's paying Selma $48,000 a year , when you figure in the extras and freebies and vacations . That 's $100,000 pretax . More than he made as a first-year lawyer ! How amazing he can pay this , how terrible that he must ! And Judith is expecting a big , shingled summer place on Nantucket someday , just like her friends have . Fifteen rooms , tennis court , heated gunite pool , koi pond . " You 'll do it , I know you will ! " she says brightly . He nods in dull acceptance at the years of work necessary ; he 'll be humpbacked with fatigue . Yes , money , he needs more money . He 's making a ton , needs more ! The law firm 's compensation committee is run by a tightfisted bean counter named Larry Kirmer ; our lawyer , a sophisticated man who made the review at Yale , has enjoyed fantasies of savagely beating Kirmer ; these scenarios are quite pleasurable for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear cheerful and positive when in Kirmer 's company . Kirmer has no idea of the imaginary wounds he 's received , the eye-gougings , dropkicks to the groin , secret heart-punctures . But if Kirmer doubled his salary , the fantasies of violence and retribution would disappear . Life would be kinda great . Now our man steps toward the apartment house admiring the cherry trees under the windows , just past their peak , as is our man himself . Passersby at this late hour notice nothing unusual about him ; if he was once sleekly handsome , he is no longer ; if he had once been a vigorous twenty-year-old , now he is paunched in the gut , a man who tosses a rubber football to his son , Timothy , on weekends . A man whose wife apparently does not mind that when he suggests that they have sex he uses mock-witty metaphors involving speedboats ( " get up on my water skis " ) or professional basketball ( " drive the lane " ) . Yes , apparently Judith likes his conventional masculinity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of Judith 's life , her lifestyle , to be honest , which is not quite the same as a sofa or a minivan , but not utterly divisible from them , either . This is the way she prefers it , too , and any danger to their marriage will come not from a challenge to its conventionality-some rogue element , some dark and potent knight-but from her husband 's sudden inability to sustain the marriage 's predictable comfort . He , for his part , does n't yet understand such things , which is to say he does n't really understand his wife . He understands his law firm and his son and the sports page . He is , in fact , very similar to a sofa or a minivan . He has never lost or gained very much . Just dents and unidentified stains . His griefs are thus far minor , his risks utterly safe , his passions unremarkable , his accomplishments incremental and , when measured against his enormous advantages of class and race and sex , more or less obligatory . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is as yet undiscovered . Am I too hard on him , is my description cruel and dismissive ? Probably . He was , after all , handsome enough , quite well thought of , dependable in word and deed . A real workhorse in the office . A heck of a guy . Right as rain , a straight shooter , a good dude . His waist really was n't one Sunday Times too thick . He was even reasonably fit . But I am allowed to distort this man , to seek indications of weakness and decay , because it makes his fate easier to explain . And because that man-you know this already-that man was me , Bill Wyeth . I 'd last talked to Judith early that afternoon , telling her I 'd see her the next day . It was one of those marital conversations full of irritation and subtext . " Timothy really misses you , " she 'd told me . " He wishes you were here . " I 'd thought about telling her I was taking an earlier flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I 'd been away for four days . My boy was turning eight , and he and his friends were set to go bowling , attend a Knicks practice , and eat at a midtown restaurant featuring waiters dressed like aliens . Then , stuffed with stimulation , they 'd all sleep over at our apartment that night . And as I opened the door the signs of their wolf-pack activity met me in the hall : a dozen-odd sport shoes scattered over the floor , a spray of coats and hats , a pile of gift bags , then a finer grade of debris-jelly beans , baseball cards , sneaker-flattened candy , removable vampire teeth , balloons , plastic spoons , streamer paper , chocolate cake , even fake rubber fingers oozing fake rubber blood . With children , one learns to read domestic disorder and its patterns like a forensic investigator sifting the wreckage of a plane . Judith , I concluded , had corralled the boys into bed , then skipped cleaning up after them . A shadowed glimpse into our bedroom confirmed my guess ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts rising and falling . ( She had n't nursed our son much , and they were still " the franchise , " I always told her , which both disgusted and pleased her , and which , we both knew-and were to learn again-was exactly correct ; at age thirty-four , her breasts still had market value-more , in fact , than either of us had dreamed . ) I gently closed the door-on this , the night my old life was to end-and peered into our son 's bedroom , where all nine boys lay huddled and overlapping in their sleeping bags like puppies . Perhaps one sighed or tossed or addressed a professional athlete in intimate dream-whisper . I kept the hall light on in case of bathroom seekers ( who can forget the hot shame of pee , the furtive , groin-clutching pajama-shuffle ? ) and drifted into our new kitchen , which had cost almost $100,000 , and picked up stray plates and pieces of shredded paper tablecloth . The multicolored chaos of the apartment suggested nothing so much as a hurricane passing over a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder Judith was exhausted . On the new kitchen counter , a kind of grayish Brazilian marble streaked with purple quartz ( " It looks-oh , it looks a foot deep ! " our designer had moaned at the prospect of further insertions of our money ) , lay a list , typed by my secretary , of each boy 's full name , his parents and/or stepparents and/or nannies , and the numbers of each ( offices , home , cell ) ; in addition , the names of certain boys had been annotated by my wife with pickup times , ear infection medication doses , etc . Innocent enough in its intention , the sheet was sociologically revealing . Here were the sons of some of the most prominent fortyish fathers in the city or , in the case of several second marriages , fiftyish fathers , and likely as not their equally prominent mothers . Every day their corporations and banks appeared in the global financial press . Citibank , Pfizer , IBM . This fact had n't been lost on me from the beginning . Certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others not . But the favorites did n't correspond perfectly with the boys in the class whose parents might be cultivated . Perhaps I had suggested a few certain other boys be invited " for fairness . " Perhaps ? Of course I had . Judith had just sighed , tallying the added effort and hypocrisy , the cost of arguing with me , the cost of not . " Okay , " she 'd breathed heavily , knowing my motivations . That was partly why she married me , no ? To eat what I killed ? Our son , meanwhile , had clapped his hands in excitement . He was a generous kid and so the party went from five to eight other boys . And here was the list of them , blurred by spilled juice , appended with a smear of chocolate icing . I set it aside and prowled the refrigerator . Some cold pasta , eight-packs of butterscotch pudding for Timothy 's school lunches . But nothing ready-to-eat for a hungry man . I called the Thai takeout place two blocks away and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , the delivery boy smiling as he took the cash tip , and then Bill Wyeth , yours and mine , spent the last minutes of his former life eating dinner , watching the sports scores , opening bills , and checking his e-mail . There was some consolation in all this multitasking and functionality , the servicing of diverse needs at the same time . Some , but not enough . Bill Wyeth has one other need , so he steals into the bedroom just to check again . But Judith is miles under , her breath faintly foul , her arm flopped out on the sheet like she 's just lobbed a hand grenade against his advance . She is not the kind of woman you can wake up in the middle of the night and jump on . Judith needs preparation-on-ramps and gradual acceleration . They 'd had sex before he left for San Francisco , but that was five nights ago , and he never partakes of the hotel porn , out of fear that it will somehow appear on the law firm 's bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data trailing behind each of us like a spider 's filament . He 'd been hoping that getting home early might put her in the mood . But no dice . He needs release , a little shot in the dark . He needs some comfort . Just a little .
