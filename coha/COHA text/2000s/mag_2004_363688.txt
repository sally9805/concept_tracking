They meet cute : Isabelle ( Eva Green ) is seemingly chained to the door of the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris in 1968 when she begins chatting up Matthew ( Michael Pitt ) , a naive young American student . She 's protesting the firing of Henri Langlois , the institution 's founder . Matthew is lost without an old movie to light his lonesome days . <P> Not to worry , Matthew . Isabelle and her saturnine brother Theo ( Louis Garrel ) have a sort of home movie  --  no camera but lots of sex and nakedness  --  that they think might be fun to make in their parents ' apartment . After the clueless mother and father depart on vacation , the kids shed their duds , their inhibitions and such political consciousness as they have . The demirevolution of the spring of 1968 begins to gather riotous force outside their windows while they play mainly degrading sexual games indoors . Eventually they find themselves eating garbage . Eventually Isabelle flirts with suicide . Eventually a revolutionary rock , tossed through their window , awakens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is last glimpsed throwing Molotov cocktails at the gendarmes . Eventually you begin to wonder what in the world has got into Bernardo Bertolucci . <P> He has set aside the spacious visual elegance of The Last Emperor , The Sheltering Sky , The Conformist . This is a deliberately cramped and ugly film . The only Bertolucci film it somewhat resembles is Last Tango in Paris  --  you know , people shutting themselves away from the world to indulge their sexual fantasies . But that film , which was rated X , had an authentic sexual charge . This one  --  which carries an NC-17 , the modern equivalent of an X  --  is grim and joyless , though it is far richer and more casual in its display of both male and female frontalia . <P> That leaves the viewer plenty of time to contemplate the film 's fundamental irony . While the youngsters are inside quite realistically acting out their fantasies , real life ( and death ) is running riot in the streets . A lot of the threesome 's games are inspired by the movies they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by memorable clips , are the movie 's best . They have wit and some satiric edge . But , possibly because of budgetary restraints , the film pretty much scants the revolution . It is a vague presence but never a persuasive dramatic force . One gets the feeling that Bertolucci , who was in Paris during the 1968 May events , feels duty bound ( or nostalgia bound ) to celebrate them . But as with sex , so with politics . His heart does n't seem to be fully in it . <P> And in fairness , why should it be ? He 's a man in his 60s , entitled to a certain ambivalence about , say , Chairman Mao and his Little Red Book . Or , for that matter , movie madness and sexual triads . That standoffishness ( or objectivity ) intermittently marks The Dreamers , which is adapted by Gilbert Adair from his novel The Holy Innocents . But it also renders the film dispassionate , curiously lifeless , lacking the energy of either youthful commitment or a deeply engaged re-examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
