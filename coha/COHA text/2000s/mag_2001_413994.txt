A new generation of artists commits the myriad wonders of the natural world to paper // What makes an art form endure from generation to generation , century to century ? An audience that continues to appreciate the material is certainly a significant part of the equation . But perhaps even more important is the sustained interest of artists themselves . Botanical painting-a blend of art and science in which plants are depicted with an eye toward exacting accuracy-has succeeded on both counts . " If you asked six artists to paint the same flower , the result would be six very different images , " explains Katherine Manisco , a Britishborn botanical painter who divides her time between homes in New York City and Rome , Italy . " That endless variety keeps this old tradition very much alive . " Arkansas painter Kate Nessler concurs . " There 's no flower , leaf , fruit , or vegetable that has n't been depicted already , " she admits . " The challenge for botanical artists today is to bring something new to subjects that have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to place a flower on a page or which parts of a plant to include or exclude , artists can create works entirely their own . The roots of botanical art in the West trace back to the " herbals " of ancient Greece and Rome , in which simple , stylized drawings of medicinal plants and flowers accompanied written observations of the natural world . As the years passed , illustrations became increasingly realistic . Throughout the 1500s and in the centuries that followed , botanical artists accompanied explorers on their voyages , capturing the flora and fauna of far-off places on paper . Back home , these sketches would be transformed into woodcuts and copperplate engravings that were then printed , hand colored , and incorporated into large picture books . These illustrated volumes proved extremely popular because they allowed the folks who had stayed at home to view the world beyond their towns and led to subsequent editions devoted to plants and flowers grown closer to home-roses or camellias , for example , among others . Early masters of the art included Basilius Besler ( 1561-1629 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redoute ( 1759-1840 ) .

Some artists draw inspiration from the whole natural world ; others specialize , as Is the case with orchid painter Carol Woodin . " The orchid family 's sometimes maddeningly intricate floral structure can be a challenge to the most patient of painters , " she says . Right : Woodin 's Sophronitis Coccinea ( watercolor on vellum , 9 " by 91/2 " ) . // Advancements in photography during the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought an end to the necessity of creating hand sketches and engravings as scientific records , since photographs could capture botanical subjects with greater accuracy . Over the course of the following century , a handful of artists kept the tradition alive , with hand-colored engravings gradually being replaced by the freehand watercolor renderings that are most common today . Unlike the still-life tradition , which often portrays flowers and fruits in a dramatic or impressionistic manner , botanical painting depicts nature in exacting detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the strict rules of botanical art stifle creativity , but that 's not the case at all , " Kate Nessler reveals . " You 're telling a story with details . Only on close examination can you capture the quiver of a delicate violet stem or the crackle of a dried leaf in the underbrush . " Nessler is not alone in her love of the genre : Since its establishment in 1995 , membership in the American Society of Botanical Artists has grown from 350 to more than 800 painters , scholars , and collectors . " There has been an incredible surge of interest in botanical art in the past decade , " says ASBA president Michele Meyer , whose San Francisco-based organization is credited by many in the field with bringing botanical art to the public 's attention through exhibitions , lectures , and workshops in galleries , botanic gardens , and natural-history museums . " Its popularity is closely connected to the heightened awareness of environmental issues these days , " she says . " As the number of flowers and green plants diminishes around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Collectors , too , have developed a soft spot for these depictions of the natural world , reports Evelyn Kraus , owner of Ursus Books &; Prints , a New York City bookshop and gallery that regularly hosts exhibits of contemporary botanical art . According to Kraus , the desire to preserve and celebrate the natural world has definitely increased the demand for this work , but she thinks that an equally important factor has been the diminishing number of antique prints on the market . " Collectors who were finding it more difficult to locate fine period pieces have been pleasantly surprised to learn that so many artists are continuing the tradition , " she says .

The factor that affects value most , Kraus adds , is the complexity of the subject . ' A single jonquil will take less time to commit to paper than an orchid with an intricate floral pattern and root system , " she explains . While some collectors favor a particular subject-hollyhocks or sunflowers , for example-others appreciate the endless variety that botanical painting provides . " Unlike real flowers or fruit , " Michele Meyer observes , " the subjects of these paintings will never fade . " THE MARKET FOR ANTIQUE PRINTS While the work of contemporary botanical artists has only recently garnered widespread attention among collectors , the market for prints from the 17th , 18th , and 19th centuries has been strong for decades . " The value of antique prints has risen at a steady pace over the past 30 years , " reports Joel Oppenheimer , president of the Kenyon Oppenheimer Gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be attributed to technology . As machines become more prevalent in our lives , more people appreciate the intrinsic beauty of handmade objects . " According to Oppenheimer , prices for antique prints range from about $500 to $10,000 or more depending on such factors as age , condition , detail , and artistry . " Many draftsmen created botanical and natural-history prints over the years , but a rare group rose to the top of their field to become great artists . " Among them was George Brookshaw ( 1751-1823 ) , whose Cantaloupe ( hand-colored aquatint ; 18 " by 24 " , left ) was published in England in 1812 . Oppenheimer 's advice for newcomers to this market is to learn as much as they can about the subject . It 's important for beginning collectors to saturate themselves with the material by reading books and catalogues and attending exhibitions , " he says . - M.RP Photograph By deciding how to center a subject on the page or which parts of the plant to depict , artists create one-of-a-kind works : Consider Katherine Manisco 's Pomegranates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 " , right ) , Rough Lemons ( watercolor on paper , 18 " by 14 " , above ) , and New York City painter Jessica Tcherepnine 's Beets ( watercolor on paper , 8112 " by 10112 " , above right ) . // <p>
