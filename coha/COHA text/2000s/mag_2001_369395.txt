I feel about foxhunting the way I do about smoking . I would n't do it myself , but as long as no one 's brandishing his lifestyle in my living room , why should I care ? The British , by and large , have long taken this view of odd behavior , which is why my homeland is still a relatively free and often eccentric place . " The unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable " was Oscar Wilde 's timeless description of the hunt scene , and it is impossible , as always , to better Wilde . If a bunch of aristocrats want to get dressed up in pink suits and silly hats , surround themselves with packs of beagles and go cavorting around the English countryside blowing horns , trashing hedges and chasing foxes , then who am I to stand in their way ? <P> Alas , this easygoing tolerance suffered a heavy blow last week . In a parliamentary vote , Prime Minister Tony Blair 's massed ranks of Labour Party deputies voted to ban the practice outright . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( another eccentric English institution ) and the Queen ( who was recently photographed strangling a wounded pheasant ) must eventually give their consent . But the Queen and her Lordships have about as much clout in Cool Britannia as foxhunters and retired generals . Centuries of English rural loopiness will therefore shortly join the ranks of extinguished British institutions , like red telephone boxes , farthings and large , expensive empires . <P> The official reason is squeamishness about the fate of the foxes . No principle is dearer to the English than the protection of animals , especially cute , furry ones . In a priceless understatement , a recent commission report on the practice concluded that the experience of being torn limb from limb by a pack of hounds " seriously compromises the welfare of the fox . " But as the spirited parliamentary debate revealed , this principle is as slippery as a wet fox in a rabbit hole . <P> For no one doubts that without foxhunting , farmers will still need to keep the fox population under control . When they 're not being adorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of other furry and feathery friends . So the farmers will be required to go out and shoot them instead , a means of execution less colorful but no less cruel than beagle munching . Without foxhunting , moreover , thousands of hounds will have to be euthanized , their reason for existence as evanescent as the morning mist in Shropshire . All the foxhunters need to do is film the mass killing of beagles to send the Brits into a Humane Society whiplash.
