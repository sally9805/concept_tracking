IN 1961 , WHEN I WAS SIX , Sinclair Oil and Gas transferred my father from Midland , Texas , to Roswell , New Mexico . Eight months later , his bosses sent him back to Midland . The first move did n't upset me ; it was an adventure , a chance to see snow for the first time , to hear flying-saucer stories in the desert , and to meet new playmates . But returning home without having a home-we 'd sold the house I first knew-and living on the outskirts in a run-down motel while my parents searched for a reasonable three-bedroom gave me a dislocated feeling I had n't known before . <p> The Kangaroo Courts Motel sprawled next to what my father called a " greasy spoon " on Highway 20 , " one of the flattest , straightest roads in America . " Right away , I knew my mother was uneasy here , trying to keep my baby sister and me happy and quiet in a hot , cramped room while semis rolled in and out of the cafe parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another after-hours in the alley separating the cafe and the Courts . She paced the room , dusting the faded orange curtains with cigarette smoke . At night I whisked open the drapes above the bed my sister and I shared , bounced on the mattress , and stared out the smudged window at KCRS 's radio towers across the road , with their blinking red lights . Somehow , Roy Orbison 's heartbreaking voice traveled up those rusted steel towers , pulsed into the lingering purple sunset , and aimed its way inside the squawky transistor radio on the nightstand next to my mother 's cold cream jar . Tumbleweeds blew across the highway , snagged on the towers and clutched the chain-link fence surrounding the motel 's swimming pool . The water looked muddy . A stale french-fry odor seeped beneath the door ; snores , laughter , weeping skittered like muffled animals inside the walls . <p> My mother left the Gideon Bible open on the dresser by the bathroom , to remind me to say my evening prayers . She 'd prop her pillow against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local paper , asking my father , " What 's a six-letter word for- ? " Sometimes she 'd teach me definitions from the puzzles : possibility , uncertainty , contradiction . The last sound I heard each night , before drifting into dreams , was my father brushing his teeth , spitting into the sink with a force that made him seem disgusted with something . As I lay in bed , I could see through a space between the drapes . Dust obscured the stars . When I woke in the mornings Dad was gone , called upon to target oil beneath West Texas 's fertile emptiness . <p> My dreams took the shapes of TV shows my sister and I watched all day , hanging off the unmade bed while my mother stood in the open doorway , smoking , flicking ashes into an Appaloosa-colored ashtray , blinking against sand in the air , and gazing nervously next door at transients , truckers , squabbling couples . Jets thundered low , on maneuvers out of a nearby air force base , rattling the windows , frightening birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin as a telephone pole . <p> Crimes , mysteries , romances-erratic , shifting , and as swiftly vanishing as soap bubbles-filled my mind while I dozed . My waking dreams , too , were shaped by the screen on the set bolted to the green pine wall . I wanted to fly the way Superman did-longed to soar toward the towers , snatch Orbison 's warble , tuck it under my cape , and sprinkle it bit by bit over Earth 's remotest areas , refreshing them with the peaceful sadness that , even as a kid , I felt only a lone balladeer could voice . <p> My father had taught me the word " balladeer " one night as we listened to the radio , and though I did n't have language , then , for my deepest feelings , I saw myself as a quiet observer of the world 's disharmonies : a highway 's comings and goings , a mother 's unhappiness . But I did n't have a guitar , and more and more , I wanted to be a musclebound hero . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucers-the kinds of spacecraft my classmates in Roswell said had crashed into the desert . I cheered as he punched aliens into oblivion . In New Mexico , my father had been summoned daily into the middle of nowhere , to check on oil rigs and roughnecking crews . I always feared he 'd run into extraterrestrials and be spirited away to Mars . <p> One afternoon , while my sister napped and I watched TV , my mother spoke on the phone to her brother Bill in Oklahoma : " . . . would n't even negotiate a moving fee , " she said . " Refuses to move us to a nicer motel . I swear , you 'd think we were poor . I mean , I know we 'll never be Rockefellers , but . . . he says we 've got to save all we can for a down payment . Says I 've got to be patient . " <p> In the parking lot next door a woman started screaming , " No no nol " I leaped up on the bed and made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a brunette by the arm . She wore a sleeveless blue dress , no shoes . They swung longneck beer bottles at each other 's blowing hair . On the highway beyond , cars hurtled into a low wall of sand . <p> " Bill , " my mother sighed , the way Lois cooed to Superman whenever he plucked her from danger . <p> In years to come , at college parties with theater-major friends , I heard that George Reeves , who played Superman on television , came to believe he really did possess superpowers , and killed himself trying . to fly off a building . In fact , he shot himself in the head , despondent over being typecast as the Man of Steel , trapped in a dead-end job . <p> It was George Reeves we watched afternoons at the Kangaroo Courts . His arms and chest were doughy . He had a soft middle . But I believed he was the strongest man on the planet . He had ( I see now ) a working-class face , with a massive jaw and hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat for long . He had the high cheekbones of my Uncle Bill , who , more than anyone else in the family , showed the Kiowa blood in our ancestry-a **29;1709;TOOLONG somewhere . Because Reeves looked like Bill , I thought of him as an oil-field worker : the toughest guys I 'd ever seen . Bill could lift the back end of a car off the ground-I 'd watched him do it , once , as he helped my mother change a flat tire on a dirt road in southern Oklahoma . What else could Superman be but a roughneck ? Forget that Clark Kent stuff . <p> " I wish you could come take me home , " my mother said to her brother . Glass shattered outside , and she closed her eyes tightly . <p> We were getting cheeseburgers one day at the greasy spoon . My mother stood at the counter , holding my sister in one arm , pulling quarters from her purse with her free hand . I sat on a metal stool bolted to , the floor . Everything around here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might carry it all away . In the booths , men and women in checkered shirts and dresses nodded , half-asleep , over coffee . The place smelled rancid . An upbeat female singer chirped from the flashing yellow jukebox . The March of Dimes gumball machine was as red as Superman 's cape . <p> " How you figger that , huh ? " a dry voice croaked behind me . " How you figger you 're worth one good crap a day without me ? Huh ? " <p> I turned to see the man in brown overalls , the one I 'd witnessed in the parking lot before , addressing the same woman in the same blue dress . In the whole joint , only my mother , my sister , and I paid any attention to them . " What the hell you looking at , lady ? " the man said . My mother stumbled back , against the counter . My sister started to cry . " This ai n't the damn Barnum and Bailey ! " I tensed my knees , ready to leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't move . The couple left . Tersely , my mother told me to grab our food sacks , and we returned to the motel in a fierce breeze that blew her tears into the dirt . <p> The rest of that afternoon she smoked more than usual , one after another , while my sister wailed on a scratchy pillow and I changed channels compulsively , unable to concentrate or relax . I sneaked glances at my mother , who paced between the phone and the door , blowing her nose into a ratty pink Kleenex . She tried Bill three times . No answer . I suggested , " He 's probably out on a derrick . " She glared at me the way the man had stared down the woman . " Every man in my family winds up in an oil field , " she said softly , as though this were my fault . " What 's so damned attractive about an old oil field ? " She lit another Lucky Strike . Her fingers shook . <p> " Is Uncle Bill going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then she went to stand in the doorway again , brushing back her hair like the smiling women on highway billboards . <p> I tugged some beef out of a burger , held it to my sister 's mouth . She sniffed , giggled , still with tears on her face , and slapped it to the gritty gray carpet . <p> I 'd failed to be a hero in the greasy spoon . Now , as though guilt were a spring inside me , I leaped off the bed , threw myself on the meat-it was a tiny ticking bombl-and hurled it across the room , away from the baby . It bounced off the TV , then the closet door , and hit my mother 's shoulder . She stood there , looking my way but not flinching . <p> My father pulled up in his Olds , a company rental , just as the sky was starting to purple . His tie hung loose around his neck . Yellow circles darkened his shirt beneath his arms . " Dinned " he called heartily , and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on her bed , turned away , rubbing cold cream into her hands . She wore a sleeveless orange blouse . A black bra strap slid down one arm . A crossword lay open before her ; nestled in a fold of the paper , a chewed-on pencil . <p> " Lookee here . " My father waved me over . From his pants pocket he pulled a brand-new transistor radio shaped like a gas pump . " And see , it 's got Dino the Dinosaur stamped on the front ! " He slipped it into my hands . " Company 's giving them away as promotional gimmicks , " he told Mama . No response . He turned back to me . " You and me and ol ' Roy , eh ? Together we 're the desert balladeers ! Oobie doobie ! " He whirled , picked up my sister , tossed her gently into the air , caught her , and tossed her again . She laughed , drooling on his tie . My mother would n't watch . <p> I waited for her to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to say she 'd had enough of this place , waited to hear that Bill was on his way . All she said was , " We 've already had these , " tapping one of the sacks . <p> " Oh . Well , then . I 'll just take them back . " He rubbed his chin . How could he not see the trouble around him ? What kind of balladeer was he ? " How about I take us to the Blue Star Inn for some chicken chow mein ? " <p> My mother capped her jar . <p> After dinner , during which Mama sat silent , my father said he had another treat for us . We tooled down 20 , past the towers , past a sign for " Handgun Safety Training " ; next to it , a small red fox lay strung across a barbed-wire fence . In our headlights , its pelt shone like a sheet of scorched aluminum foil . " The whole time I was getting my degree up in Norman , I heard about West Texas 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know what it is ? " I shook my head . My mother was stewing in the backseat , with my sister asleep in her lap , so I knew he was speaking only to me . " Well , in about ten minutes you 'll see . " <p> We passed a drive-in movie screen : a woman 's parted lips , wide as a canyon . A few miles farther , Pinkie 's Liquor 's buzzing sign , a green cactus , illuminated a dirt parking lot . A plaster cow skull , taller than my father , framed the wooden door of a boot shop . Finally , we turned onto a stony road that seemed to lead nowhere , and my father stopped the car . Dust rained on the windshield . " Do you know what meteors are ? " <p> " Falling stars ? " <p> " Right ! Follow me ! " <p> He left the headlights on ; he and I brushed past brittle , grasping tumbleweeds until we came to a giant hole in the ground . " Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nothing . " <p> He laughed . " Right . Thousands of years ago , before this was desert , it used to be something-probably a feeding ground for mastodons . Or Dino . Then a falling star landed here . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Right where we 're standing . Iron , nickel , cobalt- " <p> " Maybe it was a flying saucer ? " <p> " Nope . Just a big old rock , " <p> I reached for his hand . " You 're not going to be taken away by a saucer , are you ? " I tried it like a joke . " There are n't any saucers , right ? " He squeezed my fingers lightly . " Mama may leave with Uncle Bill . " <p> He glanced at me . " She 's going to be all right , " he said . " No one 's going anywhere . " His voice was calm , and I realized he knew all along what Mama had been feeling . I watched his features closely in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did they do this ? I wondered , looking away , staring out at nothing . Where did they get their powers ? <p> " What do you say ? Think you 'll study the land someday , like your ol ' dad ? " <p> I searched for something , anything , out there . " There 's an awful lot of it . " <p> " That there is . " <p> " It 's pretty empty , is n't it ? " <p> He laughed . " A desert rat would n't have it any other way , eh ? " <p> A dust devil scurried across the crater 's lip . Something rustled behind us . I turned to see Mama with a bottle of formula , cradling my sister in her arms . " We need to get her to bed . " <p> My father grinned . " Do n't you want to see where the falling star hit ? " <p> She looked up into the dust that always seemed to sandpaper the sky . " Any stars left up there for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> My father rubbed the back of his neck . " All right , " he said . " I 'll get you home . " <p> Her eyebrows pulled together , but she did n't say anything . <p> Back at the motel , he brushed his teeth and she tucked my sister in . I felt ashamed , sitting there , knowing my presence kept them from candor and intimacy with each other-Mama had n't taught me these words yet , but looking back , I can still breathe the tension in the room . A pickup circled the lot just outside our window , blaring Buddy Holly . My father spat into the sink and wiped his face with a towel . My mother walked around him pointedly , reaching for the ashtray and a cigarette . She tapped the Bible on the dresser , closing it , leaving a cold-cream dab on its cracked leather cover . " Yes ma'am , " I said , pulling the sheet . to my chin . I stared at the closet door beside the television . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled into the next bed , beside my mother , making the box springs shriek . Smoke curled from her mouth like a rope . My sister mumbled and kicked in her sleep . Everyone knew what everyone else was feeling , but no one was doing anything about it : My resolve strengthened . " Lord , in the morning when I wake up , I want a Superman suit in that closet . " Or maybe a guitar ? Which would be easier for God ? A costume or a musical instrument ? I imagined myself sailing , shattering the sound barrier . " A Superman suit , pressed and neat on a hanger . If it 's not there , I wo n't believe in you anymore . Thank you for your blessings . Amen . " My father switched off the light . I heard the smack of his lips on my mother 's creamy cheek , heard her turn away from him . All night , laughter next door . Diesels on the highway . <p> It was just past noon . My sister took two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother had dropped her lighter and was n't watching . I stood gripping the burger bags we 'd picked up . The bird 's eyes had been pecked out . My sister bent her pudgy knees and extended a wet finger toward a stiff black wing . I had time to stop her , or call for my mother . But I remembered my father leaving this morning , and how I 'd heard as he reached into the closet for his suit coat ( damp circles already under his arms ) , hangers tink tink tink . I looked at the Bible . We 'd never get away from this room . <p> So I watched my sister poke the bird , then , delighted , wiggle her fingers into her mouth . My mother turned , lighter in hand , and screamed at her , then me . The lunch crowd was leaving the greasy spoon . Desert rats like me , I thought : truckers picking their teeth with matchbooks , motorcyclists revving their engines unforgivingly , drilling-equipment salesmen scrabbling in their pockets for coins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loud couple stumbled out the door , locked in each other 's arms . Anger ? Love ? I had n't noticed it before , but in the harsh midafternoon light the woman was tough and swarthy-an Okie look , to me . Bill 's look . <p> Today the man and woman were smiling at each other , ignoring us , which heightened the disappointment I felt in myself , always letting Mama down . I drew a breath and screamed across the lot , " You 're a mean man ! " The food bags hissed like rattlers in my hands . The man laughed , played at eating the woman 's ear , then disappeared with her behind the cafe . My sister sniffled . My mother grinned at me , eyebrows raised . " Well , " she said , and that was all . <p> I ate my cheeseburger ravenously , and congratulated myself for being quiet and still the rest of the afternoon , watching my sister , making sure we were n't any trouble . My mother smoked in the doorway , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more relaxed than before , languorous and loose-limbed , a soft shadow against a burning rectangle of light . Jets shrieked , followed by thunder , as though the sky were a glacier cracking apart . Birds fluttered in the motel eaves . I wished Dad would stay away , just today , so things would n't get troubled again . It was n't the last time in my life I 'd wish him gone . Or home . Or safe from the disappointments of his dead-end job . I hoped the sun would n't set , that Mama would go on standing there . My gas pump sputtered : a dislocated lament begging someone not to leave . I lay back in bed , in a puddle left by my sister , and closed my eyes , happy , drifting , weak . <p>
