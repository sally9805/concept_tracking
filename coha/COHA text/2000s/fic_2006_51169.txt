We met Gaunt and Bone ( poet and thief , respectively ) back in our June 2000 issue and saw their adventures continue in the July 2002 issue . We 're pleased to welcome them back this month , although we hope they wo n't share with us that infernal book they 've got . Mr. Willrich dedicates this story to our dearly departed friend John Morressy . Any resemblances between Krumwheezle and another wizard whose name starts with the letter K are only slightly coincidental . <p> IN A TIME , O CHILD , WHEN wizards toyed with gravity , thieves were heroes , and the Aurora was not yet born , a poet fled north to World 's Rim . Her name was Persimmon Gaunt , and she stumbled in the purple sunset across the tundra , her breath streaming behind as she gasped late autumn air . Birds scattered before her , crying tuituek ! tuituek ! Beyond stretched a plain cloaked in desert-brown lichens , stained with regions of thicker vegetation such as the one she now battled . Thick clumps of sedge clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet . She trampled ground-hugging dwarf willows and birches like a crazed giant . These were the northmost representatives of tree-kind , for the taiga lay at her back . Dark evergreens fanned out a mile behind her , rising taller and milling thicker in proportion to her distance - as if tree society wanted no part of Persimmon Gaunt and her foul book . But there were those that wanted both . At treeline 's edge reared a stark birch stockade with heads of many kinds impaled upon the timbers " points . There were caribou and muskox , arctic fox and brown bear , and though there were none of the white bear , the Tornarssuk , there were many open-mouthed heads of men . The wall of the stockade grew to irregular heights , and a shadow like a hand clawed across the plain . A horn blew , burning through cold silence . A mocking , snarling chant arose . The voices were of many ages , and both sexes . The words carried far in the clear , still air . Hunger Stone ! Hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hunters were unseen , but their mammoth-sized sacrificial boulder rose to just above the level of the stockade . She thought she discerned a man-shaped shadow stretched upon it . Hunger Stone ! Hunger Stone ! She turned and staggered on . Panting , lungs aching with the cold , she could imagine Imago Bone beside her crying : Absurd , Gaunt ! Nothing to scramble upon or slip behind . We , a pair of city thieves , in the arctic ! We 're like church mice on an archery range . Then she pictured him where he actually was . She recalled him shouting from the Hunger Stone , I love you too . At last Gaunt crossed the patch of sedge and dwarf trees and fell to her knees upon a stony streambed . She slipped loose her pack , and her back slowly unclenched from the weight . She carried , it seemed , a northern trading post 's worth of equipment - fur cloaks , torches , pickaxes , a bow , dried meat . But what seemed heaviest was the reason Gaunt and Bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book 's location near the top of the pack , as though a rabid rat snuffled her neck . " You are too much trouble , " she told the thing they 'd meant to be rid of . " But you will serve me yet . I will have him back . " " It is a cacography , this book , " the wizard had rasped the day they struck for Earth 's edge . " And its power grows . " Krumwheezle of Scuttlesand had frowned at Persimmon Gaunt and Imago Bone . " Forgive me - a term of Art . " He was an unprepossessing fellow ; the wizard 's white beard covered a craggy face while his fisherman 's sweater covered a sizable paunch . He 'd come recommended as that extreme rarity : an unambitious yet powerful mage . He 'd even seemed glad of visitors , and had eagerly scrutinized Mashed Rags Bound in Dead Cow through a rune-inscribed silver monocle . But now he slumped back in a wicker chair beneath the stuffed remains of former familiars . Staring up through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his warning . " Cacography , " she answered with a bleak smile . " I assume you do n't simply mean " badly written ' ? " It was a sunny day upon the Contrariwise Coast , but she only saw this through the sparkle on the surf above . Krumwheezle 's tower descended like an incisor from a cliffside overhang , the gravity within reversed . In solarium glass , framed by the turquoise of the wavetops , Gaunt beheld herself . She could still make out the sturdy Swanisle farm girl , pale face beneath a mop of auburn hair . She could still discern the morbid poet who 'd bought a rose-and-spiderweb tattoo for her cheek . But more than that , she beheld the traveler with a year of wandering behind her . She was lean of face , focused of gaze . She 'd glimpsed much of human pain at Imago Bone 's side . Yet through the worst there were moments of strange beauty ... and stranger acts of mercy . Like the generosity of an unambitious wizard . Krumwheezle coughed , held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But mundane " bad writing " merely annoys . Magical cacographies corrupt and kill . " He narrowed his eyes at the book on the cedar table , as though scrutinizing a vulture on a stump . " They are full of tantalizing lore . Yet their ink is rife with contagion . And I have never seen one that dripped so with malice . Indeed , I suspect the creator far exceeded expectations . Most authors of cacographies hope their work will be copied , to plague the world . But no one could survive the ordeal of transcribing this tome . How ever did you come by it ? " Gaunt heard the ocean surge above her head like an oncoming storm . " The price of escaping a more immediate problem . " She declined to elaborate , as did Bone . " You say it 's growing in strength . " Krumwheezle spread his hands . " Over time the viral enchantment has evolved . It is learning how to damage its victims without killing them . " He shook his head at the book . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuffed with uneven linen pages . There was no evident reason for the sunlight to be muted in that place , but so it was . Krumwheezle looked up . " You two , for instance . " Bone , silent till now , shifted uneasily in his chair . A wary look sharpened his narrow face . He had reasons for wariness , Gaunt knew , only beginning with the blade-scar upon one cheek and the flame-scar upon the other . He did not like wizards , or the things they spawned . " Us ? " he said . " Your auras are tainted by the thing , " Krumwheezle replied . " You have probably been having your own sorts of ill luck . Tell me , are you prone to weird misadventures , strange coincidences ? Old enemies just happening to trip over you on the street ? Nameless horrors just happening to erupt near your inn ? " Poet and thief shared a look . Bone shrugged . " Just so ... things just happen . " Krumwheezle shook his head . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an adventurer . It 's the enchantment , adapting itself . " The old man flushed beneath his beard . " Now , forgive me : I assume your partnership is more than strictly business ? " In the solarium 's heat , a dry whiff of leather and dust crossed from the book to Gaunt , as if the tome were tickling her , drawing her attention . She wrinkled her nose . " A touch impertinent ... , " she observed . " You assume correctly , " Bone said . " Yet there has been no pregnancy ? " Krumwheezle pressed . Gaunt widened her eyes . " More than a touch .... " " No , " Bone said slowly . " For many years my associates were angels of death . Long before I met Gaunt , it seemed such company had made me infertile . " " Ah , that may be , " the wizard said . " But I suspect the book 's proximity would prevent children in any case . It 's begun to draw its noose around you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaunt exclaimed . " Even though we 've not read a word ? " " Marvelous ! " Bone cried , slapping his knee . " We thought destroying the book would be dangerous . But all the while the thing 's drawn peril like a breadmaker draws pigeons . We 'd have been safer dropping the thing down a well . That 's what comes of charity ! " Even months later as she crouched upon the tundra , Gaunt recalled the haunted eyes behind the mirth . Things had changed , too , for Imago Bone . Perhaps it was the mention of children , and the blush the thought had raised in her face . What was in his face had been clear to her : now he had something to lose . Indeed , his expression had barely darkened when the wizard muttered , " It is worse than that , Imago Bone . This book may kill us all . " The sentry barked at Gaunt beneath the gaping human heads and bright sickle moon . Despite his caribou-hide clothing he , like his fellow Stonekin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lands centuries before . He was no reindeer herder or iglu dweller , but a pale man of Eldshore , come up to Stonemouth seeking a brighter , sharper sort of life . That was what the taiga people whispered of the strange Southerners who moved to tundra 's edge . They were all of them questers , hoping the ice-winds would harden them , prove their worth . But whatever beliefs they carried they soon discarded like sucked bones . The Stone 's whispers were creed enough . Beneath the sentry 's fur cap lay the proof ; the flesh around his ears was scarred by the touch of stony fangs . " Who 's there ? " he said , leaning out the stockade door . Gaunt had learned enough thievery from Imago Bone that she already crouched nearby . Krumwheezle had provided fur parkas , pants , and mittens that blended well with the shadows . She was near enough to feel the man 's cloud of warm breath hit her cold-numbed face . Near enough to smell old beer and rancid spiced meat . Near enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " laughed the guard in Roil , the language of Eldshore and the Spiral Sea . " You come back here , armed with that ? I 'll gut your book , then your belly . I ca n't even read . " He raised a stone-tipped spear . But It matters not , Gaunt answered silently . The writing is magical . The dialect is aichaic , and it matters not . The light is poor , and it matters not . The letters infest your mind like wasps laying eggs in meat . But all she said aloud was , " I am sorry . " For this book was the testimony of a thousand ghosts , all slain in some bizarre and pathetic manner . In its pages the mad medium Cindersmith had congealed those spirits " hollow-eyed resignation , and unleashed metaphysical poison . The book was not truly evil - for evil , too , was a meaning . And all meaning corroded under the influence of Mashed Rags Bound in Dead Cow . The tome embodied all that was broken and pointless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " recited the guard , transfixed . " ' I , emperor of Nobeca , feared by all . Laughing , she scratched me in the eye . By instinct my right hand warded the eye - my right hand , which bore a spiked gauntlet . Thus did I pierce my brain . Now I , in my ghostly wanderings , can take pride only that I sat the babe down before I died . ' " The sentry blinked . " You fight me with a ghost sfory ? " " What 's happening ? " demanded a voice behind him . The sentry spun to answer , and impaled his eye upon his comrade 's spear . The sentry wailed , and the comrade shouted , and their grotesque embrace shoved the spear-tip deep into the sentry 's skull . The ill-luck of the book had claimed another life . Gaunt slipped through the gate , aware she 'd purchased entry by corroding the substance of the world . Inside , Stonemouth resembled an ordinary town , the wall 's ghoulishness giving way to corduroy lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firelight and chimney-smoke . For this reason Gaunt and Bone had disregarded the wall as local color and succumbed to the lures of a warm room and a hot meal . They 'd ignored the downcast looks of the old and infirm , the wild leers of the hardier men and women , and the strange scars around everyone 's ears . So too they had disregarded the unusually vile stench of the slaughterhouses . They 'd discounted it all . And now Bone lay bound to the final thing they 'd dismissed : the granite boulder big as a khan 's tent , covered in dark stains and peppered with fissures like maws with milky-white quartz teeth . Bone had secured Gaunt 's escape when the Stonekin rushed them in the town 's single inn . And though she 'd cursed him , she 'd nonetheless fled . It might be the world would suffer because she could not make herself press Rimward . But in the scales of her mind this one thief outweighed all the Earth . Not by much , for she loved the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as the weight of his hand upon her shoulder . But that was enough . She crept beside the Hunger Stone and encountered another sentry . This one was forewarned by the shouts . He thrust a knife at Gaunt , the blade shining blue in the moonlight . But the knife hit the opened Mashed Rags Bound in Dead Cow . To Gaunt 's touch , the tome quivered more like a thick carcass than a book . At the same time , her foe 's knife hummed as though connecting with steel . It vibrated in just the right manner to expose a flaw in the metal . It snapped with a ting . And now , fixated by the text Gaunt would never dare glance upon , the Stonekin intoned , " ' In the finest eatery of Archaeopolis I choked upon a pomegranate seed . With my finger I goaded my throat into surrendering the seed . But at that moment the great earthquake began . Thus I choked a second and final time , upon my own severed finger . ' " The sentry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In them Gaunt perceived a wild ruthlessness that could humble man or beast or weather . But even ruthlessness can be an ideal , a meaning . Gaunt bore the death of meaning . The Stonekin shook off his reverie and lunged at Gaunt ... and slipped on the only uncleared patch of ice in the village . There was a perfect fall for snapping the neck , and he found it . " Forgive me , " Gaunt whispered . Her thoughts fled to the interview with Krumwheezle , to Bone 's pained laughter and the wizard 's sad cough . " Kill us all ? " Gaunt had repeated , startled by the words . " In the long run , " Krumwheezle had answered , " yes . I 've never seen such a powerful cacography , and its malignancy has begun to spread beyond immediate contact . Any you 've encountered while owning it may also be afflicted . " " Skath , " Bone muttered , and " Rainjoy , " Gaunt said . " They in turn may infect others . A plague of freak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Krumwheezle looked overhead to the stuffed cat , frog , rat , and raven caught in a wave-cast net of sunlight . " I 'll console myself that my own life 's in autumn , that soon enough I 'll join my familiars . You see , the ill-luck slices deeper than you know . As a practitioner of Art , I know our world 's suffused with meaning . " Gaunt pushed back a little in her chair . Something slipped , and the chair teetered . Her stomach went queasy while she righted herself and stared directly at the tome . Perhaps by a trick of the light , it seemed to have shifted closer . Krumwheezle continued , " Ours is a magical world , friend rogues , and magic is simply meaning given motion , heft , and voice . But this book triggers freak mishaps that defy all rhyme or reason . " Gaunt took up the cup of Mirabad tea beside the book . Though sharp in just the manner she liked , the tea seemed hotter than it had earlier , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup quivered in her grip ; a hot drop stung her wrist . " They 're like gashes in the fabric of our reality , " Krumwheezle continued . " For they declare that life is meaningless . As if we were all merely fodder for cruel jokes . " Bone sensed Gaunt 's unease , put his hand upon her shoulder . She reached for it gratefully , meshed her fingers with his . After a pause , Krumwheezle said , " The more lives snuffed by the book , the more meaning dims . Indeed , our world - a flat Earth where the nearer stars are luminescent dragon eggs , the farther ones divine campfires - can not exist without meaning and beauty . Like as not we 'll vanish like a punctured soap bubble . " " How long ? " Bone asked . " Centuries perhaps . Or perhaps years . But that will be the ultimate result of your blasted book . " " Master Krumwheezle ? " Gaunt prompted after a long silence . " How can we destroy it ? " The wizard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond me . " Glumly he ticked off scores of arcane remedies , of the sort that vanquished foul artifacts of the past : dragonfire , alchemical solutions , the weight of levitating islands . But none were available to folk of the modern West , even to such as Gaunt and Bone . Even volcanoes were not as hot as in Elder Days . Bone was looking up at the inverted surf , its patterns flashing bright one moment , drowned the next . " What did you say about our world ? " he said quietly . Krumwheezle sighed . " It is a world suffused in meaning , and thus vulnerable .... " " No . You said the Earth is flat . I always knew that . But I did not think ... Gaunt , can we not simply throw the book off the edge ? " She nodded . " Yes ! Yes . It seems too obvious . But sometimes obvious solutions are best . " Yet it seemed to her that Krumwheezle gave them the bleakest of looks , as at children who announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bring an end to evil . " I will advise you and equip you , " he answered , " but I will not accompany you . Forgive me . " THE VOICE OF Stonemouth 's headman shattered the memory . " Forgive is a weakling 's word . " The tall man lurked in shadow beside the looming Hunger Stone . Gaunt glimpsed the Stone 's rough angularity rising against the white smile of the moon . Dozens of rudely shaped , crystal-fanged mouths shone in the argent light . " Told you , " Bone 's voice drifted weakly down from the Stone , " to get away from here .... " He was bound at ankles and wrists by ropes . Nothing secured the ropes but four grinning crystal mouths . " Hush , Imago , " Gaunt said . She told the headman , " I do n't like killing , " keeping the book half-shut . " Let it end now . " " Weak ! " the headman snapped , stepping into the moonlight . He wore a sneer and the white skin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringed in scar tissue and his ears resembled gnawed fungus . " Fit only for food ! " Food sang a moaning chorus from the stony mouths . Fit food . Gaunt sensed many Stonekin peering from windows , peeping around corners , creeping forward along the log lanes . She gripped the hook tight . " Let my friend go . " The headman laughed . Gaunt saw that one of his teeth had been replaced by a quartz fang . Stifling her fear , she lifted the book . But the headman raised a hand . The Hunger Stone rumbled and croaked . Go friend , moaned the stone maws . There were flashes of crystal teeth all around Imago Bone . Gaunt cried out and flung the book open . Her palm caught a corner , and the old paper was unaccountably sharp . It pierced her skin . Her blood made dark edge-marks . " ' I survived my campaign as general , ' " the headman read . " " But the day of my victory parade , a chamber pot toppled from an upper window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm all right . The Stone ... it cut my cords . " She slammed the book shut . Her hand throbbed with the motion . The Stonekin came to his senses , looking dazed . Gaunt had forestalled the curse , barely . " Bone , " Gaunt said , " let 's go . " Bone slithered down the Stone like a snake on a shovel . Gaunt caught him . The headman shook his head as though waking . " Do ... what you must . " But as he faced the thief , it seemed the ill-luck brushed him , for he bit his own lip with the quartz fang . " Do n't touch them ! " he cried , blood streaming from his mouth . Then quietly he spat , " For know this ... you belong to the Stone . " You belong , the Stone echoed . Droplets of the headman 's blood upon them , Gaunt and Bone stumbled toward the wall and World 's Rim . Krumwheezle 's library had illuminated little of the Rim . Sneezing amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symbols on maps dwindle edgeward like stars beside clouds . Sometimes cartographers helpfully decorated these spaces with ships tumbling over waterfalls , sea serpents , drowning sailors . And there were labels : Ye Abyss , or Hungry Void , or more bluntly , Abandon All Hope . But once she was struck by a purely blank region atop a map , like a landscape buried in snow . This was glossed with the perverse phrase Penultima Thule . Thule , Gaunt knew , meant Northern Land . But that the mapmaker would stop with the **35;3017;TOOLONG ... now/ that was a mystery , a conspiracy of cartographers . All she learned from Krumwheezle 's books was that Penultima Thule was a frigid waste , once inhabited by seal-hunters and reindeer herders , but now stalked by the most barbaric of southern folk . Of the original inhabitants , only the ursine Tornarssuk remained : fierce white bears with mastery of simple tools . Little would have recommended Penultima Thule - except for the odd legend or three that from there one could walk to World 's Rim . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister ships topple into the void . Doubtful as Penultima Thule might be , Gaunt and Bone were more dubious about suicide . And so their path bent north , beyond the rugged polities of the Contrariwise Coast , into the grand littoral empire of the Eldshore , and beyond into the dark green sea of the taiga . The forest of emerald evergreens and golden broadleafs bore a silence so deep as to seem deafening . It stole their voices , so that Gaunt missed the riotous chatter of cities . It made their talks rare , and serious . " It 's just as well we could have no children , " Gaunt had said one day . " Such a life is not for them . " " I 'm relieved you think so , " Bone answered . " And yet ... to see young eyes drink in the Orca Coast 's watery labyrinth ... or the diamond and turquoise wall of the Titancrypt Glacier , and the Skyblade Mountains beyond .... " " Or the cutthroats of Archaeopolis 's Crypttown ? " Bone said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bone said . " Or their parents gorged and drunk in the vice gardens of Amberhorn ... if not dead in some sewer or charnel pit ? " He shook his head , his gaze looking back over long years as a thief . " Better those eyes never exist . " " True , " Gaunt said . But she fell silent , as if those eyes were upon her . Despite this agreement , the moment weighed upon them as deeply as the ehill and the hunger . And so distracted , they had exercised little caution upon reaching Penultima Thule . That , Gaunt swore , would not happen again . But her oath might he too late . They hiked in moonlit silence , crossing Gaunt 's dry riverbed and continuing north . Cold still air polished the stars , which seemed as diamond spear-tips piercing the night 's veil . They paused when Gaunt , nursing her stinging hand , tripped over the pale rack of a vanished caribou . A dim wind-moan punctuated the curse and the rattle . " You used it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his first words since Stonemouth . " They were going to kill you , " she said . " No , " Bone murmured . He slid her wide fur pant leg ( baggy at the base , for heat flowed upward ) and absently kissed her calf in an inappropriate , albeit pleasant way . His beard stubble tickled . " I 'm afraid they were n't . And now they know about the book . " " They were n't going to kill you ? " Gaunt shivered , and not just from the air and Bone 's ministrations . " If that was n't a classic human sacrificial - Bone ? " He had quietly clamped his teeth around her calf . It was a warm sensation in the chill , but quickly grew painful . " Bone ! " He flinched backward , puzzlement creasing his face . " Gaunt ... I do n't .... " " What were you doing ? A friendly bite 's one thing in an Archaeopolis inn .... " He rubbed his temple . " Something overcame me . " Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ... about Stonemouth . They did n't want to kill either of us . They wanted to lash us to the Stone . So the mouths could fasten upon us , and ... whisper . " He turned , the moonlight revealing the dark welts around one ear . " Bone ... What did it whisper ' " " I rarely made out the words . But the sense of them stuck . It was about need , longing , starvation . I 'm hungry , Gaunt . " His jaw twitched . " The Hunger Stone makes you mad with it . There 's a gnawing inside . Not just the need of a man with an empty gut . I feel like a whole world ... with a ravenous edge like a mountain range of teeth . There are many Hunger Stones scattered across the far north , Gaunt ... stray children of the Rim . " He shook his head , as though to rend the cobwebs of nightmare . He looked north into the phalanx of stars . " We thought of the Rim as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a Being . " Despite the recurring peal of horns , the hunters kept their distance . " They expect me to join them , " Bone said simply one day . He looked thin and shrunken within his furs . " They 're calling me back . " " And what becomes of me ? " Gaunt asked . He did not answer , but gnawed at a strip of dried meat . For five days the thieves had crossed Penultima Thule . It was a strange realm for those accustomed to rocky coasts and many-towered cities . Krumwheezle had told Gaunt this land was saturated with frozen water , which thawed only near the surface . Nothing deep-rooted grew . What at first sight appeared an unending expanse of sand or soil was a ubiquitous brown lichen , supplemented in fertile stretches by thick mats of mosses , sedges , and dwarf trees . Amid these grew mushrooms and berries , startling in their color . Once they saw a white fox snuffling among constellations of little fruits pink as salmon meat . It darted off before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves with the berries . Despite the cold , the emptiness , the lean meals , Gaunt began to see a delicate beauty in the plain . Evil folk might dwell here , yet the tundra itself held no foulness . But then the sky 's vast pale blue thickened with gray-white , as if the fox had heralded the clouds . Where once the days yawned wide , now they pressed down . Snow fell - in a lazy dusting of meandering flakes , as though the land had all eternity to kill them . It grew colder , and as if in response the gash in Gaunt 's palm swelled and darkened . On the fifth day , while Bone rested , Gaunt raised the open book to a plump ptarmigan , its white girth like a feathered egg with a head , its black eyes like windows to the Rim . As she expected , the bird just sat upon its snow-dappled boulder , watching her sidelong . The victim need not be a reader , it seemed , but must have at least the capacity to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bird had seen such before , and was gone in a blur . That evening Bone crouched at their tent 's opening , staring at a moonlit snowfall resembling blue motes drifting in the sea . Where once he 'd shaved religiously by dagger-blade , now he wore the scraggly beard of some immature prophet . He tore into the dwindling dried meat . As she chewed on sour and watery black berries , he eyed her with what she preferred to believe was lust . " Any cannibal thoughts ? " she asked . He grunted . " Cannibal implies preference for human flesh . Stonekin are n't so picky . " " Is that what you are now , Bone ? Stonekin ? " " Never , " he snapped . He tore into another strip of meat . More quietly he continued , " I do feel their hunger . Perhaps it 's this landscape ... starvation seems so close at hand , survival so precarious . And the Stone ... it speaks to a part of you that feels like a gnawing void , that needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing a meal . " He met her gaze . " Even if the only candidate walks upright and shares your bed . " " Well , you are looking a little threadbare . " " Fortunately , so are you . " He grimaced . " They wanted us both , at first . A strong , healthy couple to convert . But now they 're content to let me kill you and return with the book . Idiots . They think the book 's just another weapon , when it 's really a power as bleak as the one they serve . I do n't hate anyone enough to surrender the book . And yet , in a few more days I may obey . " She took his hand . " You 've yet to obey anything in your life . " He grinned , and was at least a shadow of his old self . " You 're a poet . You tell lies to make people smile . " " You 're addressing the author of Crypt Lyrics and Songs of a Skull-toBe . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gaunt thought , to think you can evade this conversation with a kiss . And how correct . As she moved her mouth within spiderthreadwidth of his , she said , " No biting . No talk of what made you bite . " " My lips are sealed . " " Not entirely , I hope - " A new horn blast cut through the moaning wind . All previous peals had diminished with increasing distance from Stonemouth . This one sounded close . " I believe , " Bone said , " the Stonekin have lost their patience . " THEY STRUCK CAMP , hiking in a snowy moonwashed vastness like the shallows of a blue-lit sea . The horn kept sounding behind them , and the thieves " southern-bred ears failed to place the range . Gaunt would n't stop to listen more carefully . " We just need someplace defensible , " she told Bone , trying to reassure both of them . " If we can bottleneck them .... " " Ironic , " Bone interrupted , panting . " The headman 's ... lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me hungry . " " I do appreciate the warning . Keep moving . " He staggered on . " I wo n't succumb . " " I know . " " I would destroy myself first . " " Bone , enough . " " But if I were to turn ... you must use the book . " For a moment she could not answer . This was the sort of thing he usually said ( You must use the book ; this concoction 's vile but will negate the poison ; I 've stolen the empress of Amberhorn 's diamond fingernail that I might scratch your back ) where an ordinary man might say I love you . There were times she wished he were ordinary . " Very well , " she said . " But if I should perish , you must take it to the Rim . " " I care little about that . Let the world pop into nothingness , if you are not in it ! " " Swear , Imago . " " Never fear , " he sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to follow your last wish , even to the edge of the Earth ? " Her eyes narrowed . " And you must swear not to throw yourself off . " She saw she 'd struck true . " You astound me , woman ! " he snapped . " How many more instructions ? Must I now give my loot to the poor ? Make the sign of the Swan Goddess before every ambush ? Eat a radish a day ? If I choose to fall off World 's Rim , that 's between me and the abyss . " He turned , stomped into the snow-flecked moonlight , and - with a squeaking , shattering sound and a brief yelp - plunged out of sight . " Bone ! " Gaunt ran forward and stared down . What confronted her was a frozen river channel with a Bone-sized gap in its shining surface . Beneath that gap lay an ice-roofed tunnel and a groaning thief upon a dry , silty riverbed . After its surface froze over , Gaunt supposed , the river must have dried up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , insulated from the cold air , would stay liquid and empty out to sea , leaving behind a tunnel with a crystalline ceiling . Or perhaps this was all wild speculation , and the land was simply trying to kill them . But Bone was alive , nursing his ankle with a disgusted expression . " Bone ! How 's your foot ? " " It will heal . " " Your pride ? " " We wo n't speak of it . " He looked up , evaluating the climb even as she considered the downward scramble . " Unfortunate , " he said , " that we lost my ironsilk lines , along with my other tricks , at Stonemouth . If I rest a day I believe I can handle the climb . But that seems ill-advised . " " You may not have to , " Gaunt said . " The river 's path should intersect the Boreal Bight , if our sources were correct about its existence . Following this tunnel would hide us from pursuit . " " I would be happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . " " Yes ? " " Upstream I 've just spotted the nose of an adorable little white bear . " Gaunt 's heart felt swollen in her chest . " Bone , " she said in a low voice . " Try moving downstream . I 'll follow from up here . " " You certainly will stay up there , " he said , rising unsteadily . " You are not going to meet that bear 's mother . " She readied her bow , searched for the blue glimmer of the frozen river . " If you meet the mother , you must scream . " " I can oblige . " So they moved together downstream , him below the shimmering ceiling , her above . After several minutes she heard a thunderous bellow from behind and below the ice , while ahead and below came Bone 's muffled oath . And now the Stonekin howled close . Gaunt ignored the Stonekin , drew , and fired . The wound in her palm wrung tears from her eyes , but her aim was good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a point well behind the Tornarssuk 's roar , making eerie chirps and whistles like strange tropical birds . The bear 's roaring rushed back upstream . Meanwhile the Stonekin 's cries moved that way as well . Gaunt waited three breaths . She broke the nearby ice with her boot and slithered down into the channel . With luck and forewarning she reached bottom with nothing worse than cuts and scrapes . When her eyes adjusted to the dim blue light seeping down from the ceiling , she saw Bone leaning against brown frozen earth . A scent of raw , bloody meat , preserved by the cold air , assaulted her nose . Upstream and around a bend , she could hear more ursine growling . There followed many human cries of anger and alarm . These became screams of terror . " I thought you were going to stay up , " Bone hissed . She shoved him forward . " Just move , Bone , " she whispered . " At least you 'll have the advantage of going faster than I. " Wincing he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find that difficult . " " I can move quite slowly in a crisis . " Nevertheless they both advanced with quiet dispatch , staying close . Sounds of chewing and moaning followed them down the riverbed . Gaunt noticed strange markings on the walls , made from some rustylooking pigment . Again a bloody smell filled her nostrils . Wonder made her daring , and she spoke . " What are these ? " " I was hoping you 'd miss them . They 're what truly made me swear . The bear 's arrival just made the oath economical . " They were paintings of great simplicity , yet they captured an air of grace and fluid motion . These were hunting scenes , showing various animals of the north - muskoxen , and marmots , and mammoths . She had seen cave art with a similar look in remote spots on Swanisle . But some of the bipedal shapes she 'd first taken for hunters seemed to lack weapons . Indeed , Gaunt had the impression they were fleeing along with the other animals . It slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rather massive sorts , with clawed hands and extended ears . It also came to her that the sounds behind them had ceased . She glanced behind - and immediately ducked . A spear stabbed the wall , impaling one of the scrawny paintings of human prey . She beheld a huge white bear nearly filling the channel . It seemed astounding that anything so tall should stand on two feet . The Tornarssuk clutched a bloody knife carved from bone or caribou antler , with a blade as long as Gaunt 's forearm . Its bulk glittered with clumps of ice , as though it had deliberately soaked and frozen its fur before battle . Gore stained the ice . The bear wore a mask : the tanned , sliced , and stretched head of a human , secured with twine . The Tornarssuk did not roar . It did worse . It smiled . Its teeth had scarlet stains . Gaunt held her ground . She was too shocked to do much else . Bone was at least prepared for the sight . He threw a rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone bounced uselessly off the armor of ice and matted fur . The sound did break Gaunt 's paralysis . She managed to stumble backward as the Tornarssuk swiped at where she 'd been . Cold air from the swing struck her face ; the scent of human entrails churned her stomach . The scent proved too distracting . She tripped , sprawling upon the silt . With a snarl Bone leapt onto the bear 's back . " Mine ! " she heard him screech . " My food ! " She did n't pause to wonder which morsel he meant . She reached into her pack and pulled out Mashed Rags Bound in Dead Cow . " You use tools , " she shouted , opening it wide . " Paint symbols . Can you read ? " The bear sniffed and stared at the pages , ignoring the madman trying to chew it to death . It dropped its knife and bellowed . It seized Bone and threw him overhead at Gaunt . Poet and thief went down in a heap . The bear turned and loped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tornarssuk left Gaunt 's sight , she saw it snatch up the cub , which had been trailing a few paces back . The adult bear nuzzled its offspring . There was no sign of meaningless death afflicting either . " It seems you ca n't read , " Gaunt groaned , " Not quite . Not yet . This horror ca n't claim you . And yet .... " The bear snarled once more , as if in repudiation of humanity and all its works . Both white shapes turned away . And yet you feel it . This book would destroy your kind along with ours . Did you sense that ? Or did you glimpse what we humans are capable of ? And fear what you might become ? Bone moaned beside her . " What ... what was I doing ? " " Succumbing , " she said . She helped him to sit up . " And yet you turned that to our advantage . " " Damn the Stonekin , " Bone said . " If I must cannibalize someone , let it be them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleak smile . " I think the Tornarssuk 's family had first pick . " They sat like that for a long , cold while , breathing hard . They leaned close together for warmth . Bone gently set his teeth upon Gaunt 's ear . Their eyes met , and their bodies separated . " We must keep moving , " Bone said , looking away . He rose stiffly and shambled downstream , away from the charnel reek and Gaunt 's gaze . THEY WALKED the riverbed beneath the ceiling of moonlit ice . The painted scenes dwindled in frequency as the light dimmed . After the moon set , they continued through the night , feeling their way along the passage . Gaunt kept behind Bone , several paces back now . She did not want to blame him for the new chill between them . But such thoughts nipped at her like the throbbing of her hand . It was Bone who stole the book , when first we met . Perhaps that awakened it , and otherwise it would have lain dormant on its forgotten shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe . I might have had children . I might .... She realized she was asking herself when to do as Bone asked : slay him and proceed alone . Not now . Do n't be weak . After all the harm he 's caused .... Not now ! At last her reverie was broken by fresh air and a tang of salt upon her tongue . They stumbled into the open on a starlit rocky shore , a gentle surf lapping near their feet , a whistling wind chilling their faces . They camped amid boulders , exhausted , gambling that nothing would pounce from passage , sea , or sky . Late in the morning they rose to survey grim rocky hills southward and a vast bay of deep blue water ahead . The bay stretched from the dark , star-flecked west to the pink , cirrus-traced east . It was choked with thousands of small islands of floating ice , like fragments of drifting crystal . No more than a mile or two offshore , the fragments merged into a sheet of pack ice beneath swirling blue-gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes , like the horns and claws of frozen demons . " The World 's Rim , " Gaunt said , excitement heating her voice , even now . " Krumwheezle 's sources described a calm narrow sea , freezing over as it kisses the void . " Bone pointed to a dark lip of coastline . " It appears the ice touches land at that point . Let 's go . " They passed an old slaughter pit covered with thousands of clean bones , near an irregular man-shaped shadow cast by piled boulders . In the cold dry air the scent of raw meat remained . Bone came to a halt . Pebbles spilled into the hollow , making a sound like tinkling glass . " The Old People , " he said quietly , " scared caribou to this place with the shadow of the cairn . Here also they brought the walrus to carve . Children sang happily of meat . This was before the change , before the Hunger Stones transformed some of the People into the first Stonekin . " " Bone ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stone . This was always a hard land , but not always haunted . It changed long ago . The land shifted and the bay became sheltered . The ice crept over the abyss . And something from the abyss crept in . " He opened his eyes and gestured . " Look . Hunger Stones . " Far out along the peninsula , Gaunt saw little gray bumps like tiny warts . " But there are dozens ! " " Yes . And I know they are calling to Stonekin across the arctic . I know , because they also call to me . " They passed between the huge Hunger Stones that flanked their path like a granite honor guard . The wind hummed down the aisle like the distant chorus of an ancient play . But Gaunt heard nothing from the Stones themselves . She almost wished she could , for she saw Bone trembling with their influence . Each time he tensed anew , a part of her demanded she kill Bone now , before his will broke . Finally , to silence that part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm ached , she gripped long enough for a little of Bone 's warmth to soothe her numb skin . He nodded in silence . Just after noon they passed the last Hunger Stones and reached a snowy slope descending to the ice . So thoroughly snow-clad was the ice that it looked like a particularly flat extension of the land . Only the milky , fractured edges of the sheet , a mile off on either side , gave away the truth . The sun cast golden reflections upon their road north , making it seem a royal road into the stormy darkness . In the quiet beauty of this place , in what might be termed the ultimate part of Penultima Thule , Bone spoke for the first time in hours . " You came for me , " said Bone . " At Stonemouth . And at the riverbed . " " You 'd have done the same . " " I 'm not so sure . I was proud of you , you know , when you fled Stonemouth . Thought I 'd finally trained you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's more than one kind of selfishness . " Gaunt paused to look around her at the bright , silent margin of the Earth . " I came back for you . But I selfishly want you in my life , and nowhere else . I 've come all this way to save us , and perhaps everything . But that quest also gives me an ironclad excuse to see all this . " She smiled , and Bone said , " I have never seen you so beautiful , " and Gaunt , haggard , famished , wounded , saw her own spirit reflected in his face , and knew it was true . That would do , she thought , in place of the ordinary words of love . But her next thought was , Now he is fully distracted - you 'll never get a better chance to strike . She shook it off , took his hand , led him onto the ice . The howls of the Stonekin soon followed . Fearing their pursuit but also their footing , they hiked Rimward . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartographers forbore to mention , for it was no proper land at all . It was a place of strange silences , punctuated by the odd moaning wind . Sculpted by that wind the ice bore low wavy ridges , like ripples in a giant 's white tablecloth cast over the bones of dragons . Sometimes there were delicate growths atop the ridges , like diamond candelabras . They tinkled and collapsed as Gaunt and Bone 's pickaxes struck nearby . Once a jagged path of dark water crossed their path , smoking at the edges like a river of the fabled underworld . There was nothing for it but to jump , the floes creaking beneath them . Elsewhere dark blue troughs indicated places where floes had recently fused . These grew thinner and rarer as the pair walked on . As the afternoon ebbed , the expanse of ice widened to either side , and the travelers could no longer see open water . Dark clouds choked the blue sky overhead . Mist and shadow hid the horizon . The way grew rougher . There were circular pits filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice rose in ridges resembling piles of white boulders , or rounded hills . Sometimes these formations bore glistening mouths with icicle teeth . As with the Hungry Stones , Bone tensed beside the mouths . Gaunt 's hand tensed upon her pickaxe . But Bone mastered himself and hiked on . The dark , pressing sky , the white landscape , and the stabbing cold these were besieging things . They drove Gaunt to burrow deeper into her clothing , sent her mind down into strange reverie . You stand upon water , she thought . Nothing but frozen water upon liquid water . Or , her mind continued relentlessly , you have already crossed to where the ice overhangs nothing at all . You are at the limits of the Earth , Persimmon Gaunt . You were not meant to be here . Now there came a sound like distant thunder or the working of infernal machines somewhere miles north . " The ice , " Bone muttered , looking like a true mad prophet with his distant gaze , the weight of the pack upon his shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The winds of the Rim fracture it , causing plates to buckle and shift and fall . " " You learned this at Stonemouth ? " " I learned it now , " he said , " from the mouths in the ice . " Gaunt bit her lip for comfort - and so she could feel something . " If so ... throwing the book over the edge might be suicide after all . " " Worse , we could be sealed away inside a fissure , as far from our goal as if we still sipped tea at Krumwheezle 's . We must be cautious . " That advice comes late , she thought . Fresh howls came from behind , but still she could see no one beyond the southward ridges . They kept going . As the sun set to the southwest , casting a pall like blood over the clouds and the surface underfoot , a fine mist arose . It made the land and even Bone indistinct , mere shadows in a scarlet haze . Gaunt could still see her own feet clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice grew so mirror-like that Gaunt could see herself , Bone beside her , stumbling relentlessly on . The need to spot surface irregularities anchored her gaze , and she often watched her reflection watching her . It seemed to Gaunt that her reflection winked . Distracted , she chanced upon a thinner region of ice , which bent and creaked beneath her weight . She stumbled . Her face plunged to within an inch of her reflection . It smirked . " No rest for thieves , " Bone said , hauling her upright . She nodded as if sleepwalking , not trusting her own perceptions . She looked around and saw only a rosy haze . Were there shadows moving behind ? Again , she could only trust herself enough to stay on her feet . She wanted to say something to Bone , but somehow the mist and silence made him seem miles , not inches , away . She looked down , and saw Bone 's reflection leer at her own . Meanwhile Bone himself was scanning the land . Before Gaunt could react , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself flinched and struggled for balance . Her reflection stumbled . It seemed the mirror-Gaunt tried to escape but was betrayed by her own terror . Gaunt 's stomach clenched as she watched the image of her lover gnawing the mirror-Gaunt 's throat . Blood spattered upward , cutting off her view . The last thing she saw was the mirror-Bone choking to death , having gorged too greedily . Red covered the ice . " Bone ? Imago ? " She tore her gaze away . Her real love watched the mist behind them . " We 've company , " he said . She looked and this time saw many tiny dark silhouettes . " They , " she managed to say , " are not our only worry . Our own reflections haunt us . " " That is true , " her own voice answered from the north . THEY TURNED and beheld themselves . Like a drawn curtain , the mist cleared to an extent of about five paces . On the far side of that clearing stood the mirror-Gaunt and the mirror-Bone - no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spied a bit of glint about the duplicates , a slightly blue complexion to each . The mirror-Gaunt 's throat was whole , and the mirror-Bone 's lips unblooded . But the ice beneath was sanguine as a royal carpet . " I am annoyed , " said the true Imago Bone . " I own little save my uniqueness . I put a high value on it . " " As I do mine , " said his duplicate . The voice sounded alike , if more frosty . " What are you , " demanded Gaunt , " truly ? Do not hide behind mists and reflections . What Being commands you ? " " We are , " said the mirror-Gaunt , " what will make you not . When things encounter their opposites , are not both negated ? " " Why make us not , " Bone asked , " when we all could simply live ? " He waved his hand grandly . " Let us divide the world . You may have everything north of here . " " You have limited understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to life . It is purer . No hurt . No shame . No fear . " It reached into its pack and pulled forth a duplicate of Mashed Rags Bound in Dead Cow . " No chance , " said Bone . He snatched out the true tome . Something in the reflections " cool voices , however , warned Gaunt . On instinct she lunged and grasped the true book , preventing Bone from opening it . Wordlessly , Bone nodded . He still trusted her , even if she could n't fully trust him . Slowly , using the corners of their eyes , they looked up at their counterparts . Their reflections " book was still closed . " So ? " Gaunt demanded . " Open it . " " Open yours , " goaded mirror-Bone . " No chance , " Bone said , and stashed the tome away . And now Gaunt was certain that opening their own book would have reflected the curse back upon them . She suspected their pointless deaths would have resembled the bloody scene she 'd witnessed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " can you ? The book is a power beyond your own , or you 'd have struck us down . Do I have the pleasure of addressing the power behind the Stones ? " " I am that power , " said the mirror-Bone and the mirror-Gaunt in unison . " The God Who Is Not . " " If it is a pleasure , " added the mirror-Gaunt coolly , " that is your affair . " " Oblivion awaits you here , " said the mirror-Bone . " Oblivion pursues , " Gaunt observed . " And we have an errand . " " You must not proceed , " said the mirror-Bone . " Why is that ? " " Your errand , " said the mirror-Gaunt , " will destroy me . " Gaunt shared another look with Bone . The thief said , " In all candor , that possibility had not occurred to us . You are vulnerable to the book ? " " The book destroys creatures of mortal consciousness , " said the mirror-Bone bleakly , " and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " Bone began . " I am The God Who Is Not , " interrupted mirror-Gaunt . " Therefore I am not a god . But were I a god , I would be the god of not . " Bone made a helpless gesture at Gaunt . Gaunt said , " Your metaphysics are your own business . But know this : a wizard informed us the book will end the whole world , given time . " " He spoke truly , " said mirror-Gaunt . " Yet to perish alongside the Earth would be mere oblivion . It is preferable to my destiny should the book pass beyond the ice , and encounter me directly . " " How can the book destroy what is nof ? " Gaunt wondered aloud . Both icy doppelgangers stared . Then they leaned back simultaneously and laughed . Their mirth was like the groaning and creaking and shattering of ice . The sound filled the cold expanse . Howls and hoots rose from behind , in answer . The Stonekin knew where to find their prey . Bone grimaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doppelgangers into fragments . As they came to pieces the duplicates lost the pink of their flesh , the brown of their furs , and became simply pieces of ice . The surface beneath , however , remained blood-red . " They might have said more , " Gaunt said . " I hate the ranting of cosmic forces , " Bone said . Gaunt looked behind them . She had the impression the shadows were running . " We 're out of time . " Bone nodded , as if he expected no better . " How much farther , do you think ? " " According to the sources , we should encounter places where the stars shine up through the ice . But we 've found none . " If possible , she felt even colder as she spoke . She looked toward the Rim , into a wall of mist . She looked over her shoulder at the charging shadows . Last she looked down at the field of blood . " May I play a hunch ? " " You 're welcome to play a harp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the red ice . Bone shrugged and joined her . They hacked again and again . The crimson cleared . All around the little white quarry they 'd created there lay a field of dimly shining stars , glinting beneath ten or so inches of ice . " It was no coincidence the entity attacked us here , " Gaunt said . " It meant to distract us . " Bone snatched the book and dropped it beside him . " Let 's assume good luck . " " You realize , good luck could kill us just as sure as bad . " He grinned , something of his old self awakening . " We are thieves . Even a prolonged thieving life is a stolen , golden moment , flickering like torchlight . If it gutters out here , so be it . " " Speak for yourself . I 'm a poet . I will live forever . " And so they attacked the ice as if it - after all the night angels and sorcerers , all the sentient bees and embodied sorrows - was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was literally true : for the ice trembled like the skin of a living thing , and cracks formed around their feet . And as it tore and screeched , it found a voice . I was the oblivion at World 's Rim , and all was empty and good . Then the icy mirror formed above this span . I stared upward and saw myself staring downward . I , the abyss , gazed into myself . " Keep going ! " Gaunt shouted , as Bone wavered . The cracks widened all around them . It seemed to Gaunt that the three largest fissures beside her offered glimpses into other times and places , past , present , and future . As she hacked she beheld ancient sorcerers of Swanisle sacrificing humans atop megaliths , and old Empress Nayne of the Eldshore slicing down foes . She saw kleptomancers of Palmary and outcasts of Serpenttooth plotting in the present . She saw strange armies of the future warring with weapons that leveled mountains , their banners celebrating faiths and ideologies and creeds incomprehensible ; yet somehow Gaunt understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of not . ( Once she saw a boy with her hair and Bone 's eyes , laughing in silk robes upon a litter , barking commands to cowled men with serrated shining swords . She flinched away from that last vision . ) They kept hacking . But Bone was slow , distracted . I grew aware . I was a god , yet not a god . I am the God Who Is Not . When you think of the bleakness at the top of the world , you think of me . When cold thoughts lick your skull , when your eyes meet the blankness at the edge of everything , you 're touched by me . When you devour what you love , you partake of me . Between axe-strokes , Gaunt heard the roars of the Stonekin . Do not cast your book into me ! It will destroy me . And to destroy a Not is to make a Something . I do not wish to be Something ! I do not know what that will be ! I am afraid . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaunt . " Gaunt , " screamed Bone . " I can not .... " And terrible hunger in his face , he lunged at her . She had one instant to choose : strike at him , or strike at the ice . She chose the ice . She broke through . An inky gap appeared in the white , and a vortex was born , sucking the air above down into the void . Now Bone was upon her . He tore away her axe , and her glove came with it . He tossed both aside , and she heard a clatter and hum as the axe skittered within the pit , spun by the whirlwind . She stared into his eyes . " It 's done ! " she cried . " It 's done . Fight it ! " She raised her hands . He lifted his own axe , shuddering . His eyes locked on her right hand . Its palm was swollen and dark . He brought his axe down upon the ice . " Hold onto me , " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for now the axe blade held . The book , free upon the ice , slithered toward the gap , shot upward . It billowed open , swirling within the vortex , revealing the spidery dark flourishes of its text . But poet and thief had already pressed their faces to the ice . They heard cries and gurgles as their pursuit arrived . They heard horrible tearing sounds and spattering impacts . And the wind howled louder . There came a dull series of thumps , and the wind 's groaning grew dim . Slowly Gaunt looked up . She and Bone lay at the margin of a pile of fur-clad corpses . The bodies of the Stonekin had temporarily plugged the gap . At the top lay the headman of Stonemouth , his crystal tooth glinting red . Bone 's lost pickaxe , its blades scarlet , rose from the headman 's chest . Of Mashed Rags Bound in Dead Cow there was no sign . Gaunt touched Bone 's shoulder . " Time to run ? " he mumbled into the ice . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact they could n't quite , but scampered and slid as the sun faded from sight and the clouds shone with nacreous moonlight . A groan rose behind , expanding into the sound of shattering ice . Somehow they reached the bridge to land . They scampered like lunatics beneath the hidden moon , every bit of ice between them and Penultima Thule an affront to their sanity . Once they passed an ice-ridge with a fang-filled mouth . As they struggled by , the mouth hissed and spat and crumbled . Its icicle fangs scattered across their path in a writhing , serpentine pattern . The remnants tinkled underfoot . Now Boom came a sound like a bloated thunderstorm , and bouldersized ice fragments fell from the sky . Water surged behind them and the bridge fragmented . Soon they crouched upon an ice island no larger than Krumwheezle 's sitting room , screaming . The waves shoved them south . WHEN THEY RECOVERED their wits , they stumbled like toddlers onto a muddy shoreline . Behind them sounded a roar like a thousand flooding rivers . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the eerie light they beheld the bay rushing into the void , until finally all that remained was a thin ribbon of moonlit water within a muddy canyon . Beyond , where the ultimate ice had reigned , the convulsion had shredded the clouds , and bright stars flanked a ridge of crazily jagged hills . Volcanic flame spouted at intervals . But something drew their eyes from the hellish scene . Rising through the dark above the Rim was a serpentine shape woven of light . It shimmered eerie pinks and greens and yellows and purples . It looked as tall as a mountain range , thin as a wedding veil . Stars flickered through its form . It coiled through the northern sky with the manner of a lazy tiger , then launched itself to zenith like a gazelle escaping doom . It was like a river , like an emperor 's robe , like a child 's breath . " What is that , " Bone murmured . " That is Something , " said Gaunt . The Something in the sky appeared to notice them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaunt 's skull to her smallest toes . And she thought , If I die , at least I saw this . The thing in the sky , with an air of humor , twitched a little at one rosy fringe . An object spun down from the heavens , and landed with a splat in the mud . It was the savaged cover of a book . It sheltered only tatters of parchment . Down it tumbled , into the lake that marked the grave of Ultima Thule . " The book could n't endure , " Gaunt guessed . " It was a disease of meaninglessness . And now , despite itself , it 's caused Something to be . " She beheld her right hand , and the dark swelling was gone . There remained only a thin cut , like a new lifeline . " The curse is bankrupt , " she said . " Go ! " Bone called to the lights in the northern sky . " Enjoy your existence ! Do Something . We 'll do likewise . " The Something did not respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting unknown mountains before sliding from view . " What will we do , Bone ? " Gaunt asked , looking after it . " Hard to predict . But I believe it involves going south . " They climbed the coastal slope , away from ultimate things . They found the gallery of Hungry Stones . Each boulder was now a pile of rubble , and the quartz teeth of the former maws lay in sinuous trails as if in imitation of the Something . Bone paused among the remains and looked a long while at the sky , where the new being had come and gone . " There 's no hunger , " he said . " Only wonder . " " I 'm glad of that , " Gaunt said . She added , " The sentiment is not wholly selfless . " " I 'm sure I 'll be ravenous in time . " He stooped to gather a dusting of quartz , then brushed his hands clean . " But it will be ordinary hunger . I will not dream of devouring all . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rose , studied her face , said finally , " I saw a child . " " I too , " she said . " It was ours . Perhaps I am transformed as well . Perhaps we can .... " " Yes , " she said , exhilaration and fear so close within her as to become the same thing . " But Bone ... he was cold and cruel , like the God Who Was Not . " He turned to her . " He ? But it was a girl . She rode a horse , unladylike , grinning at the ocean . She was like the new thing in the sky . " She let go a long breath . " They could both be our future . " " Or neither , " Bone said . " I could still be cursed . Or we could have a different child . Or none . " " And is that what you wish , Bone ? No child ? " He smiled , shook his head . " I 've blinked into the abyss . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Persimmon Gaunt . And I hope the future has your eyes . " And that is how the Aurora came to be , my child . And that , in a sense , is how you came to be as well .
