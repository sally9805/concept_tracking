Chapter Thirteen In the Great Head Candy had always prided herself upon having a vivid imagination . When , for instance , she privately compared her dreams with those her brothers described over the breakfast table , or her friends at school exchanged at break , she always discovered her own night visions were a lot wilder and weirder than anybody else 's . But there was nothing she could remember dreaming  --  by day or night  --  that came close to the sight that greeted her in The Great Head of the Yebba Dim Day . It was a city , a city built from the litter of the sea . The street beneath her feet was made from timbers that had clearly been in the water for a long time , and the walls were lined with barnacle-encrusted stone . There were three columns supporting the roof , made of coral fragments cemented together . They were buzzing hives of life unto themselves ; their elaborately constructed walls pierced with dozens of windows , from which light poured . There were three main streets that wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lined with habitations and thronged with the Yebba Dim Day 's citizens . As far as Candy could see there were plenty of people who resembled folks she might have expected to see on the streets of Chickentown , give or take a sartorial detail : a hat , a coat , a wooden snout . But for every one person that looked perfectly human , there were two who looked perfectly other than human . The children of a thousand marriages between humankind and the great bestiary of the Abarat were abroad on the streets of the city . Among those who passed her as she ventured up the street were creatures which seemedrelated to fish , to birds , to cats and dogs and lions and toads . And those were just the species she recognized . There were many more she did not ; forms of face that her dream-life had never come near to showing her . Though she was cold , she did n't care . Though she was weary to her marrow , and lost  --  oh so very lost  --  she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was filled with every kind of diversity . A beautiful woman walked by wearing a hat like an aquarium . In it was a large fish whose poignant expression bore an uncanny resemblance to the woman on whose head it was balanced . A man half Candy 's size ran by with a second man half the first fellow 's size sitting in the hood of his robe , throwing nuts into the air . A creature with red ladders for legs was stalking its way through the crowd farther up the street , its enormous coxcomb bright orange . A cloud of blue smoke blew by , and as it passed a foggy face appeared in the cloud and smiled at Candy before the wind dispersed it . Everywhere she looked there was something to amaze . Besides the citizens there were countless animals in the city , wild and domesticated . White-faced monkeys , like troupes of clowns , were on the roofs baring their scarlet bottoms to passersby . Beasts the size of chinchillas but resembling golden lions ran back and forth along the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure white but for its turquoise eyes , wove cunningly between the feet of the crowd , chattering like an excited parrot . To her left a thing that might have had a lobster for a mother and Picasso for a father was clinging to a wall , drawing a flattering self-portrait on the white plaster with a stick of charcoal . To her right a man with a firebrand was trying to persuade a cow with an infestation of yellow grasshoppers leaping over its body to get out of his house . The grasshoppers were n't the only insects in the city . Far from it . The air was filled with buzzing life . High overhead birds dined on clouds of mites that blazed like pinpricks of fire . Butterflies the size of Candys hand moved just above the heads of the crowd , and now and then alighted on a favored head , as though it were a flower . Some were transparent , their veins running with brilliant blue blood . Others were fleshy and fat ; these the preferred food of a creature that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tail vast , painted with colors for which Candy had no name . And on all sides  --  among these astonishments  --  were things that were absurdly recognizable . Televisions were on in many of the houses , their screens visible through undraped windows . A cartoon boy was tap-dancing on one screen , singing some sentimental song on another , and on a third a number of wrestlers fought : humans matched with enormous striped insects that looked thoroughly bored with the proceedings . There was much else that Candy recognized . The smell of burned meat and spilled beer . The sound of boys fighting . Laughter , like any other laughter . Tears , like any other tears . To her amazement , she heard English spoken everywhere , though there were dozens of dialects . And of course the mouth parts that delivered the words also went some way to shape the nature of the English that was being spoken : some of it was high and nasal , a singsong variation that almost seemed about to become music . From other directions came a guttural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this , and she had advanced perhaps fifty yards in the Yebba Dim Day . The houses at the lower end of The Great Head , where she was presently walking , were all red , their fronts bowed . She quickly grasped why . They were made of boats , or the remains of boats . To judge by the nets that were hung as makeshift doors , the occupants of these houses were the families of fishermen who 'd settled here . They 'd dragged their vessels out of the cool evening air , and taken a hammer and crowbar to the cabins and the deck and hold , peeling apart the boards , so as to make some kind of habitation on land . There was no order to any of this ; people just seemed to take whatever space was available . How else to explain the chaotic arrangement of vessels , one on top of the other ? As for power , it seemed to be nakedly stolen from those higher up in the city ( and therefore , presumably , more wealthy ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , to provide service for the next house . It was not a foolproof system by any means . At any one moment , looking up at the hundreds , perhaps thousands , of heaped-up houses , somebody 's lights were flickering , or there was an argument going on about the cables . No doubt the presence of monkeys and birds , pecking at the cables , or simply swinging from them , did not improve matters . It was a wonder , Candy thought , that this outlandish collection of people , animals and habitations worked at all . She could not imagine the people of Chickentown putting up with such chaotic diversity . What would they think of the ladder-legged creature or the smoke creature , or the baby beast throwing nuts in the air ? I need to remember as many details as I can , so when I get back home I can tell everybody what it was like , down to the last brick , the last butterfly . I wonder , she thought to herself , if they make cameras here ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cameras . Of course she 'd first have to find out if the few soaked and screwed-up dollars she had in the bottom of her pocket were worth anything here . If they were , and she could find somewhere to purchase a camera , then she could make a proper record of what she was seeing . They she 'd have proof , absolute proof that this place , with all its wonders , existed . " Are you cold ? " The woman who had addressed her looked as though she might have some Sea-Skipper in her heritage . Vestigial gills ran from the lower half of her cheek into her neck , and there was a faintly mottled quality to her skin . Her eyes had a subtle cast of silver about them . " Actually I am a little , " Candy said . " Come with me . I 'm Izarith . " " I 'm Candy Quackenbush . I 'm new here . " " Yes , I could tell , " Izarith said . " It 's cold today ; the water gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going to rot and collapse on itself . " " That would be a pity , " Candy said . " You do n't live here , " Izarith said , with a trace of bitterness . She led Candy to one of the houses made from fishing boats . As she followed the woman to the threshold , Candy felt just a little pang of doubt . Why was she being invited into Izarith 's house so quickly , without any real reason , beyond that of a stranger 's generosity ? Izarith seemed to sense her unease . " Do n't come in if you do n't want to , " she said . " I just thought you looked in need of a fire to warm you through . " Before Candy could reply there was a series of crashes from outside the Head , accompanied by a din of yells and screams . " The dock ! " Candy said , looking back toward the door . Obviously the jetty had finally given out beneath the weight of the crowd . There was a great rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course only going to make matters worse out there . Izarith showed no desire to go and see what had happened . She just said : " Are you coming ? " " Yes , " said Candy , offering the woman a smile of thanks and following her inside . Just as Izarith had promised there was a fire in the little hearth , which the woman fuelled with a handful of what looked like dried seaweed . The kindling was consumed quickly and brightly . A soothing wave of warmth hit Candy . " Oh , that 's nice , " she said , warming her hands . On the floor in front of the fire was a child of perhaps two , her features one generation further removed from the sea-dwelling origins of her grandparents , or perhaps her great-great-grandparents . " This is Maiza . Maiza , this is Candy . Say hello . " " Hell . O , " said Maiza . With her duty to courtesy done , Maiza returned to playing with her toys , which were little more than painted blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted red ; a crude copy , perhaps , of the vessel whose boards had built these walls . Izarith went to check on the other child in the room ; a baby , asleep in a cot . " That 's Nazr , " she said . " He 's been sick since we came here . He was born at sea , and I believe he wants to go back there . " She bent low , talking softly to the baby . " That 's what you want , is n't it , dearling ? You want to be out away from here . " " You want that too ? " Candy said . " With all my heart . I hate this place . " " Ca n't you leave ? " Izarith shook her head . " My husband , Ruthus , had a boat , and we used to fish around the Outer Islands , where the shoals are still good . But the boat was getting old . So we came here to trade it in for a new one . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd be able to get a good boat . But there were no new boats to be had . Nobodys building anymore . And now we 're almost out of money . So my husband 's working putting in toilets for the folks in the towers , and I 'm stuck down here with the children . " As she told her tale , she pulled back a makeshift curtain which divided the little room in two and , sorting through a box of garments , she selected a simple dress , which she gave to Candy . " Here , " she said . " Put this on . If you wear those wet clothes much longer you 'll get phlegmatic . " Gratefully , Candy put it on , feeling secretly ashamed of her initial suspicion . Izarith obviously had a good heart . She had very little to share , but what she had , she was offering . " It suits you , " Izarith said , as Candy tied a simple rope belt around her waist . The fabric of the dress was brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of blue and silver in its weave . " What 's the currency here ? " Candy asked . Plainly Izarith was surprised by the question ; understandably so . But she answered anyway . " It 's a zem , " she said . " Or a paterzem , which is a hundred zem note . " " Oh . " " Why do you ask this question ? " Candy dug in the pocket of her jeans . " It 's just that I have some dollars , " she said . " You have dollars ? " Izarith replied , her mouth wide in astonishment . " Yes . A few . " Candy pulled the sodden notes out and carefully spread them on the hearth , where they steamed in front of the fire . Izarith 's eyes did n't leave the bills from the moment they appeared . It was almost as though she was witnessing a miracle . " Where did you get those ? " she said , her voice breathless with astonishment . Finally she tore her gaze from the hearth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Is it possible ? " " Is what possible ? " " Do you come from the Hereafter ? " Candy nodded . " Actually I come from a place called America . " " America . " Izarith spoke the word like a prayer . " You have dollars , and you come from America . " She shook her head in disbelief . Candy went down on her haunches before the fire and peeled the now almost dried dollars off the hearth . " Here , " she said , offering them to Izarith . " You have them . " Izarith shook her head , her expression one of religious awe . " No , no I could n't . Not dollars . Angels use dollars , not Skizmut like me . " " Take it from me , " Candy said . " I 'm not an angel . Very far from it . And what 's a Skizmut ? " " My people are Skizmut . Or they were , generations ago . The bloodline 's been diluted , over the years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure Skizmut . " She looked melancholy ; an expression which suited the form of her face better than any other . " Why so sad ? " " I just wish I could go back into the deeps and make my home there , away from all this " Izarith cast her sad eyes toward the window , which was without frames or panes . The crowd outside moved like a relentless parade . Candy could see how hard it would be to exist in this tiny hovel , with the twilight throng moving up and down the street outside , all the hours that God sent . " When you say the deeps , " Candy replied , " do you mean the sea ? " " Yes . Mama Izabella . The Skizmut had cities down there . Deep in the ocean . Beautiful cities made of white stone . " " Have you ever seen them ? " " No , of course not . After two generations , you lose the way of the fish . I would drown , like you . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , as close as we can to the deeps . Live with the rhythm of Mother Izabella beneath us . " " Well , perhaps the dollars will help you and Ruthus buy a boat , " Candy said . Candy handed Izarith a ten and one single , keeping six for herself . Izarith laughed out loud , the music in her laughter so infectious that her daughter , Maiza , started laughing too . " Eleven dollars ? Eleven . It would buy two boats ! Three boats ! It 's like eleven paterzem ! More , I think ! " She looked up , suddenly anxious . " And this is really for me ? " she said , as though she was afraid the gift would be reclaimed . " It 's all yours , " Candy said , feeling a little odd about sounding too magnanimous . After all , it was only eleven bucks . " I 'm going to spend a little piece of this one , " Izarith said , selecting a single , and pocketing the rest . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten this day . I think you have n't either . " Her eyes were shining ; their joy increased by the silvery luster that was the gift of her Skizmut breeding . " Will you stay with them , while I go out ? " she said . " Of course , " Candy said . She suddenly realized she was starving . " And Maiza ? " " Yes , Muma ? " " Will you be kind to the lady from the Hereafter , while I fetch bread and milk ? " " Grish fritters ! " said Maiza . " Is that what you want ? Grish fritters with noga seeds ? " " Grish fritter with noga seeds ! Grish fritter with noga seeds ! " " I wo n't be long , " Izarith said . " We 'll be fine , " Candy said , sitting down beside the child in front of the fire . " Wo n't we , Maiza ? " The child smiled again , her tiny teeth semitranslucent , carrying a hint of blue . " Grish fritters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! "
