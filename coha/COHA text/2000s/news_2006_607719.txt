<p> On July 27 , four days before the trade deadline , the Nationals will be at .500 and on the edges of the NL wild-card race . And they 'll also be in one heck of a quandary . Should they trade away veterans for prospects , as the team 's brain trust will probably prefer ? Or should they add players for a long-shot run at the playoffs to appease their delighted but short-sighted fans ? <p> Cut out this prediction so you can send it to me baked in a crow pie . A team that went 30-49 after last July 5th , then was abysmal in spring training and started this season 13-27 , is about to inspire talk of a winning year . RFK will bounce again soon . <p> This is a kind of fool 's gold prophecy  --  it looks good , but may be a fake . Baseball plays devious tricks . The game is about to play one in favor of the Nats . The question , before this season ends , will probably be whether it was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team . Last year , the Nats had an insanely difficult schedule , playing 104 games against winning teams . If an 81-81 record can be remarkable , theirs was . Now , the opposite is likely to happen . So many factors now favor the Nats that they may have trouble avoiding a 51-51 record by the end of July if they play even passably well . <p> First , almost every team in every year plays out its season in a series of streaks and slumps . Last year 's Nats were a perfect example with a season progression of 23-18 , 1-7 , 26-6 , 9-24 , 18-16 and 4-10 . Where 's the .500 team in that statistical mess ? <p> Slumps and streaks are the nature of the game . One tends to beget the other . Once a team becomes convinced its luck has changed  --  or it 's found its style of play or fixed its rotation or whatever its previous misery  --  it usually stays hot for weeks , even if it 's only a mediocre team . The Nats now think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5-4 over the Braves last night in Atlanta , was pure blessedness . The game ended with a bases-loaded smash by Adam LaRoche off Chad Cordero . Anywhere but directly at an infielder and the Nats lose . The rocket found Jose Vidro 's glove for a groundout . Save , Cordero ! <p> The second factor favoring the Nats is even more powerful . Just as the team has improved its play and regained confidence , the club 's schedule  --  which was such an anchor last season  --  has suddenly become an equally lopsided boon . <p> Starting with an 11-game homestand this Thursday , the Nats have a 42-game feast until July 27 when they play tons of home games ( 27 ) and scads of contests against four of the five worst teams in baseball . The Nats will get a wonderfully disproportionate helping of woeful Marlins , Pirates , Devil Rays and Cubs  --  16 games in all . These are not just losing teams , they are bad . The Nats also play the Rockies and Orioles , both losers , seven times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like seven against the Phils and Giants , both just 29-27 before last night 's games . <p> What 's going to keep the Nats from playing 25-19 ball to get to .500 ? After all , by next week the Nats will have their best pitcher and best hitter of last season , John Patterson and Jose Guillen , back from the disabled list . If the Nats can survive into June with one win from Patterson , from whom they expected 15 wins , why would n't they think they 'd weathered the worst of the season 's storms ? <p> Besides , omens are showing up . The bullpen just added rookie Bill Bray , 21 , the team 's No. 1 draft pick in ' 04 , to help space the workload more sensibly among the established relief crew . In his first big league game , Bray threw one pitch , watched Brian Schneider throw out a runner to end the inning then watched Schneider hit a two-run homer in the ninth to give him the win . <p> All of this good cheer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody can stay as hot as Alfonso Soriano has been for the last 17 games , reaching a silly pace for 60 homers . Why , he 's on a pace for 412 total bases . From ' 37 to ' 97 , the NL had two 400-total-base seasons  --  by Stan Musial and Hank Aaron . Still , do n't underestimate Fonzie . He had 381 and 358 total bases in ' 02 and ' 03 . Hard as it may be to believe , what he 's done to date is n't terribly far beyond what he 's done before . <p> The hard question for the Nationals , and their fans , is whether they even want their team to capitalize to the maximum possible extent on the opportunities of the next seven weeks . Everybody wants to win . But what if the Nats actually played their best ? What if , after starting the year losing almost every one-run game , they simply evened the odds and won most of them for a while ? What if , instead of watching walk-off homers in Atlanta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All the details of the grand plan of the Nats ' new ownership have not been laid out yet . But the general shape has been made perfectly clear by President Stan Kasten : The Future Is n't Now . Build a team worthy of a new $611 million ballpark in Southeast . If nothing else , you owe it to the town that forked over so much cash . The year the new park opens  --  ' 08 , with luck  --  takes care of itself . But by ' 09 , a smart and responsible ownership would want to put a consistent winner on the field . <p> To do that , on such a tight ' 09 or ' 10 schedule for fielding an authentic contender , some sacrifices will almost certainly have to be made . A glance at Kasten 's spectacular record in Atlanta tips you off to what they 'll be  --  the certainty of short-term pain for the sake of increasing the odds of long-term gain . <p> So , while we 're inviting mockery , let 's make another prediction . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock of many of its players  --  will have improved substantially , aided by as weak a 42-game schedule as you 'll see . <p> That 's when Nats fans will find out why truly well-run franchises are so rare . From a distance , it seems so easy to say , " Why does n't every team do it the way the Braves did it ? " But up close , seen day to day , there is always some perfectly wonderful reason to take the short-term pleasure , refuse the pain and rationalize the decision . <p> In a few weeks , the Nats may still be stuck in the doldrums , weak schedule or not . But if they rally , if they make their run at .500 or even above it , a crucial juncture will arrive for Washington 's new team , its executives and its fans . Exactly the players who are getting the headlines , creating the cheers and making the third-base box seats at RFK bounce again , will be the players who should probably be traded when their value is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real value . <p> How difficult will it be to make those deals for players who , after barely a year in RFK , have already become household names and fan favorites for their deeds in ' 05 ? <p> This is how hard : Say the words : " Trade ' em all . Get prospects . Lose 100 games in ' 07 and get better draft picks . " It hurts , does n't it ? You do n't even want to say it ( and I do n't want to type it ) . <p> In almost every sport or business , it seems so easy to " do it the right way "  --  in theory  --  until the time actually comes . Then it gets hard in a hurry . If the Nats play as well as they should against the lame schedule they face between now and July 27th , a classic collision between short-term pleasure and long-term gain should be on full display at RFK . <p> Enjoy Alfonso and Livan , Vidro and Guillen , and maybe some others , too .
