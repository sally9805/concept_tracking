To take out Osama bin Laden with a search-and-destroy mission , you have just a few minutes to find , identify and attack . How do you locate one man  --  one wary , mobile guerrilla  --  amid the trackless peaks and chasms of Afghanistan ? He 's protected by caves and safe houses and ultraloyal bodyguards . He travels with a few aides he has known for life , in vehicles that change daily , perhaps with a decoy double nearby . You 've got eyes in the sky scanning every rocky quadrant , and those satellites can see trucks and buildings and moving people  --  but they ca n't pick out his face . Technology might get you close , but not close enough : You need another man  --  someone in his inner circle or in the Taliban , or overheard chattering unwisely  --  to give him up . <P> So the U.S. must get its eyes and ears down to ground level . It might start the search in the mud-brick city of Peshawar , Pakistan , hard by the Afghan border at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists meet , form cells and deploy  --  and where access to the closed world of the Taliban begins . Bin Laden 's foot soldiers regularly slip through the walled enclaves and jostling bazaars to recruit jihadis or send out instructions . Taliban fighters float through to spy and resupply . Every Afghan faction has its representative in some dim house . Intelligence agents linger in the lobby of the Pearl Continental Hotel , where the phones are tapped and drivers let fall scraps of information . Places like this are where the operatives who can pin a real-time target on bin Laden must be recruited or bought or blackmailed . But the terrorists have their agents here too , looking for those who are looking for them . <P> No Western CIA man is going to penetrate these dark corners . Even if the agency 's directorate of operations had an adequate supply of case officers who speak the local dialects  --  which it does n't  --  the Americans typically attach them to embassies and consulates , where their diplomatic cover makes them easy to spot , and the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back home , intelligence sources tell TIME , the agency 's directorate of intelligence had just one Afghan analyst prior to Sept. 11 , and he 's been moved to a special center near the State Department to work 18 hours a day . <P> The American intelligence community 's single greatest failing is its lack of good " humint "  --  human intelligence , the dirty , diligent , shoe-leather penetration of terror networks . The humint void is behind the CIA 's failure to pick up advance word of the Sept. 11 attacks , and it makes ferreting out bin Laden especially hard . " We do n't have real spies anymore who go out and get dirt under their nails , " admits an Administration official . The CIA rolled up most of its regional networks when the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989 . Its old sources dried up , and the Executive Order that put restrictions on hiring local assets with unsavory backgrounds made the agency reluctant to rent new ones .
