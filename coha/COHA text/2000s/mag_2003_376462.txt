When U.S. authorities in Iraq picked three companies last month to build a wireless telephone network for the country , they were pleased that no Americans were among the winners , a fact they hoped would silence those who charge that the Bush Administration is handing reconstruction contracts only to business cronies and campaign contributors . But some telecom-industry insiders complain that the winners of the licenses , which cost just $5 million but could eventually be worth as much as $1 billion a year , benefited from ties to prominent Iraqis on the U.S.-backed Governing Council . The majority partner in the consortium that was awarded the southern-Iraq license , for instance , is Dijla Telecommunications Corporation , a Baghdad outfit headed by Ali Shawkat , the son of Mudhar Shawkat , a senior adviser to Iraqi National Congress President Ahmad Chalabi . Coalition officials and the Shawkats denied to TIME that the family 's connections were behind the decision to grant Dijla the license . But others contend the deal reeks of cronyism . " The mobile contracts were all politically divided , " says an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . " It 's the same as Saddam 's time . It 's about who you know . " <P> Now another deal is coming under scrutiny . A senior Pentagon official told TIME that the U.S. is reviewing its decision to grant the mobile license for Baghdad and central Iraq to a consortium led by Egyptian telecom giant Orascom because of its ties to Nadhmi Auchi , an Iraqi-born billionaire who built his fortune partly through arms deals with the Iraqi regime in the 1980s . Industry sources say Auchi provided Orascom with a $20 million loan to help pay down its $500 million debt . The sources say the loan gave Auchi , who faced French prosecutors earlier this year for his role in a corruption and embezzlement scandal , a controlling stake in Orascom . A senior U.S. official says Orascom 's ties to Auchi are being investigated . As a result , no mobile licenses have yet been issued . <P>  --  By Romesh Ratnesar .
