Robert Todd , 15 , missed huge pieces of the plot when he saw the latest Star Wars movie . " Who 's supposed to be the young Darth Vader ? " he asked his dad . Robert has severe to profound hearing loss , and like most of the 28 million other deaf or severely hearing-impaired Americans , he ca n't follow a movie without some help  --  from captioning or a companion . Last month his father Rob Todd filed a class action in federal court in Texas against 12 film-production companies and theater chains . The suit , the first legal slap at movie studios in an emotional struggle between deaf activists and the film industry , claims that by failing to provide enough captioned screenings , distributors and theaters are violating the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act . Studios should supply theaters with open-captioned films , in which dialogue appears onscreen , Todd 's attorneys say . The studios ' complaint against open captioning has been that it will annoy hearing customers . But advocates say open-captioned screenings , which occur sporadically around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown used to captions on TVs at gyms and airports , advocates say , which may make the studios ' case less persuasive to a jury .
