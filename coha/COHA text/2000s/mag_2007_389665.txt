game-show host , 83 , Hollywood INTERVIEWED BY MATTHEW BELLONI PHOTOGRAPH BY CHRIS MCPHERSON Cars and money . Everybody wants cars and money . I did Truth or Consequences for eighteen years . I 've done Price Is Right for thirty-five years . I did Miss USA and Miss Universe for twenty-one years . I did the Rose Parade for twenty-one years , and I did the Pillsbury Bake-Off for fifteen years . I did the Indianapolis 500 parade for twenty years . I 'm a guy who 's kept a job once he got it . Why should I pay attention to prices ? I ca n't win . I was married at twenty-one ; Dorothy Jo was twenty . She was with me all the time until she died . For some men , maybe a second or third marriage would work out fine . In my case , I had my marriage and she was the love of my life . Photograph : After more than fifty years in television , thirty-five as host of The Price Is Right , Bob Barker turns in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have time for children . I do n't regret it , not when so many of my friends are having so much trouble with their children . I have thirteen ducks , and that 's a lot of work . Real men are vegetarians . I do n't think I would have worked as long as I did had I not been a vegetarian . I 've never objected to the adulation . When someone approaches me , I am complimented . Everyone in TV and the movies should remember where they would be without those people . Which ditch would they be digging ? In all truthfulness , television is at about its lowest ebb right now . If you 're gon na be a Barker 's Beauty , you must have one thing : You have to look smashing in a swimsuit . There are some young women who have beautiful faces but do n't look good in a swimsuit . We have girls who look beautiful in swimsuits . That 's an impossible question . But the most consistently beautiful women come from South America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , do the line . " I say , " I do n't have time , " and they say , " Come on , Bob , you 've got time ! Do the Happy Gilmore line , " and I say , " How much time do we have ? " And the producer says , " Four seconds , " and I say , " No way , I ca n't say , " The price is right , bitch ! " in four seconds , " and right as we go on the air , the crowd screams , " Aaahhhhh ! " An overstuffed chair in the shape of Marilyn Monroe 's lips . Where would you put that ? And believe it or not , we gave away a plastic submarine that you could actually go underwater with . Someone realized that a contestant could go down in their prize and never be heard from again , so we stopped that . I was humiliated to be charged with something so contemptible as sexual harassment . People think we had this big affair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told her that I thought it was a mistake , and she became furious and sued me . She ended up dropping the case . Stay away from anyone you work with . I 've done karate for thirty years . I studied with Chuck Norris . That 's another reason I think I 've lasted this long . Almost any man looks better in a dark suit . I am still sexually active . Just not as active as I once was . I think Viagra does help . You should try it . It might surprise you . And your friend . I look much better with a tan . I 've been known to tan for three hours at a time  --  every day if I could . As a kid in South Dakota , we took our shirts off when school let out and did n't put them on until school started in the fall . We 'd go down to the Antelope Crick  --  that 's c-r-i-c-k , not creek  --  and we 'd dive in without a stitch on . I 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cancers from my misspent life . I go in every three months to get precancerous things removed . But it was all worth it . You know the line . Sure , everyone does . I 've been told by animal groups that I 've really made a difference . That means everything . I do n't try to always get a laugh . I enjoy helping other people be funny . One of the nicest letters I ever got was , after a show , an elderly lady wrote me and told me , " I 've never been as funny as I was that day . " That day I earned my money . Change is n't always good . Sometimes changing things is a terrible mistake . = The Useful Part BOB BARKER 'S VEGAN ENCHILADA BAKE 12 oz frozen vegan burger-style crum- bles ( Morningstar Farms ' work well ) 1 packet taco seasoning 2 tbsp vegetable oil cup finely chopped scallions 2 tbsp all-purpose flour 1 cup low-sodium vegetable stock 2 cans black or pinto beans , rinsed 2 cans enchilada sauce 1 bag corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 4-oz can green chiles 1 small bag of Fritos , crushed 1 .
