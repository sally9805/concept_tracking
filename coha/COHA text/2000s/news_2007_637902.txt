<p> It 's 118 degrees in Baghdad , but Peter Hudson is willing to sweat it out there , literally , for 18 more months . Why ? So he can save up enough money to buy his first home back in the States  --  ideally with a swimming pool . <p> " I 'm really , really hoping for a pool , " says Hudson , 32 , who works for a contractor providing private and corporate security outside Baghdad 's Green Zone . By working in Iraq , he can temporarily pull in a six-figure salary that 's about double what he 'd earn doing similar , if much less dangerous , work in the USA . <p> For most of us , it 's hard to imagine risking our lives in a war zone to afford the American dream . Yet many first-time home buyers are resorting to unusual  --  though mainly non-life-threatening  --  extremes to scrape together money for a down payment and qualify for a loan . A rising number are making life-changing sacrifices , such as raiding retirement accounts , taking second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to government and industry figures . <p> Headlines about skidding home sales and prices portray a buyer 's market for real estate . For first-time buyers , though , the view is quite different . For them , the market is more challenging now than at any time since the early 1990s . <p> Rising mortgage rates have eroded almost all the financial relief that buyers might have derived from the slight decline in prices in most areas . On top of that , lenders are now demanding that customers produce larger down payments , more cash reserves in the bank , higher credit scores and less debt  --  all of which many first-time buyers lack , especially in high-cost states such as California , New York and Florida . <p> Nearly half of first-time home buyers nationwide last year put down no money , according to the National Association of Realtors , compared with fewer than one in five repeat buyers . The remaining first-time buyers put down a median of just 2% of the purchase price . <p> " I could put anybody in a loan last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at First Capital Mortgage in San Diego . But , " In the last six months , all of the big lenders are shutting down all special programs they were working with because they 've realized it 's bitten them . " <p> Now , she says , " I 'm turning away 50% of my first-time home buyers . They just ca n't qualify . " <p> It 's easy to say that the mortgage industry has finally returned to its senses , and to responsible lending policies , because a record 16% of borrowers with subprime adjustable-rate mortgages were in default at the beginning of the year . Dozens of lenders have gone out of business since the end of last year . <p> But the tighter mortgage market is not only shutting out borrowers with weak , or subprime , credit ratings . It 's also putting pressure on first-time borrowers , who sometimes share financial characteristics with subprime borrowers : meager savings , a new job and a brief credit history ( which , in effect , is equal to a poor credit history ) . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car loan or student loans , which can reduce the amount that a mortgage lender will give them . And just one late payment from their college days can haunt them for years . <p> Broader market hampered <p> As lenders raise their standards for borrowers , the squeeze on first-time home buyers is constricting the broader real estate market and slowing the recovery . That 's because about one in three homes sold last year went to a first-time buyer . As these first-timers are shut out of the market , sellers ready to move up to bigger houses have a harder time selling their homes . <p> In Miami , for example , where the median-price home has catapulted from $155,000 to $400,000 since the beginning of 2003 , the demand for starter homes has largely dried up . Even though for-sale signs are sprouting on lawns like dandelions after a summer rain , sales of single-family homes priced below $250,000 tumbled 50% from March to May , compared with the same period last year , says Ron Shuffield , president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors . <p> " The decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kind of a surprise , " Shuffield says . " That 's usually where we have the greatest number of buyers . It 's tougher for first-time buyers to save deposits and come up with the cash necessary to close " a sale . <p> Which is why Chad Moskal , 33 , an account executive at a printing company , gave up his apartment on the beach in Miami last summer and moved back in with his parents in Chicago . He and his brother Paul , 34 , who 's working two jobs as a cardiovascular technologist and has also been living at home , are buying their first house together this month . A home in Chicago , Chad Moskal decided , would be cheaper to buy than a similar one in Miami . <p> The number of people who are moving in with friends or family , or sharing apartments or houses to save money , has caught economists at the Realtors association off-guard . The growth in " new households "  --  first-time buyers or first-time renters  --  has plunged 70% from last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Lawrence Yun , the NAR 's senior economist . " Even during a recession , household formations do not slow to this current level . " <p> Moving back in with his parents helped Chad Moskal pay off his bills and save some money . But he still felt compelled to cash out the $6,000 in his 401(k) retirement account to deliver his share of the $15,000 down payment  --  plus part of the money they will need to fix up the $290,000 home they bought in Skokie , Ill. , just outside Chicago . <p> " That 's the kind of extreme measures it takes " for some first-time home buyers to enter the market , Paul Moskal says . <p> Tapping retirement accounts <p> Last year , about one in 10 first-time home buyers tapped their fledgling retirement or pension accounts to help come up with a down payment , according to the NAR . And that was back when mortgage companies seemed to be giving loans to anyone with a pulse . <p> " My mortgage broker was n't accepting zero down , " says Alfonso Rey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-bath condo in San Francisco  --  one of the nation 's most-expensive markets  --  for an eye-popping $714,000 . <p> Rey and his wife had been outbid on 16 properties until they offered $62,000 more than the asking price for the condo  --  and wrote to the owners , pleading with them to accept their offer so they would n't have to move out of the city . <p> To scrounge up a 5% down payment , Rey and his wife sold their cars and cashed out the entire $36,000 Rey had socked away in his 401(k) . To keep their monthly payments low , they took out a loan that lets them pay only the interest for the first five years . They 're taking a calculated risk , though , that the value of their condo will rise . With their interest-only loan , Rey and his wife will owe the same principal balance in five years . And their mortgage will reset , possibly to a higher interest rate . <p> Rey says his parents and friends told him he was crazy to use his retirement savings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an MBA program at the University of San Francisco , says he feared that if he did n't buy now , he would never be able to afford a home , because he expects real estate prices in San Francisco to continue rising . <p> Such desperate measures make financial planners cringe . If you 're under age 59 1/2 and you withdraw money from a retirement account , in most cases you 'll not only have to pay income taxes on the withdrawal , you 'll also get socked with a 10% penalty . <p> " You 're wiping out your retirement , and if that 's the only money you have for a home , maybe you should n't be buying a home , " says Ed Slott , an accountant and IRA expert in Rockville Centre , N.Y . And after that money is gone , " What if the roof leaks , then what are you going to do ? This is just the beginning " of the expenses of owning a home . <p> There are still some 100% loan programs available for people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhonda Woods , a 23-year-old factory worker , obtained a no-down-payment loan through Freddie Mac last month to buy her first home in Battle Creek , Mich . She bought it with her fiance but says , " Everything 's in my name because I have a little better credit . " <p> Such federally sponsored programs from Freddie Mac and its sister organization , Fannie Mae , have income limits and a maximum loan ceiling of $417,000 . That 's not enough for some buyers in the most expensive markets . And last month , Fannie Mae raised the cost and lending criteria for its no-down-payment mortgages . <p> The Federal Housing Administration , which caters to low-income and first-time buyers , also offers a 3% down-payment loan . But loan limits make it less effective in many high-cost cities . The agency also plans to close a loophole that lets sellers help buyers with the down payment . <p> So in the end , some first-time buyers give up and move to a lower-cost city , sometimes in another state . <p> Looking elsewhere <p> Corporate consultant Christa Schlaudecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons she left Washington , D.C. , last year for Cincinnati . Two weeks ago , she moved into her first condo , which she bought the old-fashioned way : with a 20% down payment , saved a little at a time , out of each paycheck . " I do n't think I would have been able to ( buy a home ) any time soon in D.C. without taking on more debt , or a risky loan , " Schlaudecker says . " If I would have bought something in D.C. , I probably would have needed my parents ' help . " <p> Meanwhile , Hudson , who will complete his contract in Iraq in early 2008 , says he wo n't be able to afford to buy that house with a swimming pool in his hometown of Milford , N.H. He says his $250,000 price target would buy him " a shack or a very nice condo " there . <p> So on vacation this month , he flew to Houston to look at properties and get a feel for the market .
