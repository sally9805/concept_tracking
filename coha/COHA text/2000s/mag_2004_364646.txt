D-day came in the 58th month of the war in Europe , less than a year before Germany 's surrender . Nothing on that day proved more essential to success than time . Not the time of tide and moon phase on June 6 , 1944 , but the much more consequential arc of the preceding 57 months . The nearly five years that separated D-day from the war 's outbreak provided time for America the Unready to draft , train and deploy an invasion force of some 3 million men ; time to season those untested civilian soldiers in North Africa and Italy ; time to stockpile in Britain nearly 5 million tons of munitions , thousands of aircraft and an armada of 6,483 ships ; time for British and U.S. bombers to cripple Germany 's industrial plant and snarl its rail lines ; time for the Soviets to bleed the Wehrmacht white on the ghastly killing fields of the eastern front ; and , not least , time for Franklin Roosevelt to reassure the American people that their country 's cause was just , its leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. 's most valuable ally in World War II . It saved the lives of countless soldiers who would surely have perished in an earlier assault on Hitler 's Fortress Europe . It all but guaranteed victory when the colossal D-day operation was at last launched . As with so much else in World War II , the U.S. had more of it than any other belligerent . Winston Churchill tendered the U.S. its first gift of time by standing steadfast against the Nazi juggernaut in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz in 1940 and 1941 . Thereafter , the U.S. had time in copious abundance , thanks mostly to the skill and cunning of F.D.R.  --  including , especially , his wily management of relations with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin , whose much abused people were plunged into unspeakable woe by the German invasion of June 1941 . <P> The War Department 's original plans for attacking Nazi Germany envisioned a major cross-Channel invasion in mid-1943 , with the possibility of a smaller-scale landing at an earlier date if the Soviets were on the point of collapse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 German divisions had overrun the Soviet Union to a depth of 1,000 miles , wreaking mayhem on a scale that John F. Kennedy later compared to " the devastation of this country east of Chicago . " The fate of Britain and the U.S. alike hung on the Soviets ' survival . " The prize we seek , " said Dwight Eisenhower in 1942 , " is to keep 8 million Russians in the war . " <P> Roosevelt accordingly assured Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov in the spring of 1942 that he could " expect the formation of a second front this year . " Stalin was momentarily mollified . But he was soon disappointed and then venomously embittered when it became clear that the U.S. would not open a second front in 1942 or even in 1943 . As compensation , Roosevelt offered Stalin some Lend-Lease aid , vague assurances of a free hand in postwar Eastern Europe , and a pledge to accept nothing less than Germany 's ( and Japan 's ) unconditional surrender . The Russians fought on , but at horrendous cost . Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American machines  --  and with Russian men . The accusation arose from anger and cynicism , but it had the sting of truth . For every American who gave his life in World War II , some 59 Soviets died .
