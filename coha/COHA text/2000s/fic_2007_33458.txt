Charlotte It was all I could do not to curse my husband out -- my husband , a man who was never home more than a few days at a time , a man who did n't seem to care about his wife in the least , a man who was probably sleeping with only God knew whom . Which is why after five years of pleading with him to change and begging him to spend more time with me , I had finally had enough . I was finally in a place where I would no longer tolerate the world-renowned Reverend Curtis Black or the adultery I was sure he was committing . " So when exactly are you going to be here , Curtis ? " I asked now , gripping the phone tightly . " I just told you . In a couple of days . " " I realize that , but I need to know a specific day . What I need to know is the time your flight will be arriving at O'Hare . " " Well , Charlotte , as much as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " You do n't know ? How could you not know ? " " Because I just do n't . " " Curtis , please . Do you think I 'm that stupid ? Do you really think you can get me to believe that you 're coming home this week but your travel reservations still have n't been arranged ? Do you really think I 'm that crazy ? " " Like I said . . . I 'll be there in a couple of days . " See , it was comments such as this that made me want to do unspeakable things to Curtis . Mademe want to snatch him down from that nice little pedestal that thousands of people nationwide had placed him on . What I wanted to do was show him firsthand that being a New York Times bestselling author did n't mean that he could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to . But I decided instead that I would calmly try to reason with him one last time . " Curtis , have you even thought about the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you even aware of the fact that you 've now been gone for two weeks straight , and that once you return , you 'll only be here for five short days ? " " Charlotte , why are we doing this ? Huh ? Because you know just as well as I do that my speaking engagements are very necessary . You 've known for the last five years that this is what I have to do if you want to keep living the wealthy lifestyle you so desperately wanted when we were first married . " " But baby , there has to be some sort of balance , " I said , remembering just how miserable I 'd been before his publisher had offered him a contract with an initial advance worth seven hundred fifty thousand dollars for one book . " Look , either you want luxury or you want average , " he said , sounding impatient . " What I want is for you to be here with your family . Matthew and Marissa need you , Curtis , and I 'm tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve-year-old boys need their fathers . " " All three of my children , including Alicia , know that I love them and that I have a job to do . I 've explained to them that it wo n't always be this way , but for now , this is what I have to do . " " Curtis , all I 'm asking is that you please cancel some of your commitments . I need you to spend more time at home . " " It 's not going to happen . Not right now , and to be honest , I 'm tired of repeating the same words to you over and over again . " " Oh , so now you 've got the nerve to be irritated ? " I said , my last bit of tolerance evaporating second by second . " No , I just do n't see a reason to continue discussing a situation that is n't going to change . " " Well , maybe the problem is n't your speaking engagements , Curtis . Maybe it has more to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because , knowing you , you 've probably got a different woman lined up in every city . " " You mean like the way you slept with Aaron behind my back ? How you slept with that deceitful lunatic even though he claimed to be my best friend ? Or do you mean like how you lied about Matthew being my son when you knew full well that he might not be ? Or maybe you mean like how because you slept with Aaron , we had to get a paternity test just to make sure Marissa was actually mine ? So tell me , Charlotte , which sin of yours are you talking about exactly ? " At that moment , I wondered when Curtis would ever stop wallowing in the past and would eventually forgive me for the way I had betrayed him . Because whether he wanted to admit it or not , it was n't like any of this had happened one month ago . As a matter of fact , it had been five whole years since Marissa had been born , and to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to mention it was n't like he 'd been this perfect little Boy Scout himself . " You know what , Curtis , as far as I 'm concerned , you need to get over it . What you need to do is stop making all these lame excuses and get your priorities in order . " " No , what I need to do is the same thing I 've been doing all along . Making a ton of money so that you can continue living like the queen you think you are , and so that I can maintain the type of freedom I 've definitely become accustomed to . End of story . " His tone was razor sharp and more than anything I wanted to hurt him back . What I wanted was for him to feel more pain than he was now causing me , but for some reason I could n't find the words . I was speechless and the only thing I could think to do was slam the phone down on its base .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
