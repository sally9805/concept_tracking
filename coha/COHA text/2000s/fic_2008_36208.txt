Excerpt <br> Kneeling in the fragrant moist grass of the village green Clara Morrow carefully hid the Easter egg and thought about raising the dead , which she planned to do right after supper . Wiping a strand of hair from her face , she smeared bits of grass , mud and some other brown stuff that might not be mud into her tangled hair . All around , villagers wandered with their baskets of brightly colored eggs , looking for the perfect hiding places . Ruth Zardo sat on the bench in the middle of the green tossing the eggs at random , though occasionally she 'd haul off and peg someone in the back of the head or on the bottom . She had disconcertingly good aim for someone so old and so nuts , thought Clara . <br> ' You going tonight ? ' Clara asked , trying to distract the old poet from taking aim at Monsieur BTliveau . <br> ' Are you kidding ? Live people are bad enough ; why would I want to bring one back from the dead ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head . Fortunately the village grocer was wearing a cloth cap . It was also fortunate he had great affection for the white-haired ramrod on the bench . Ruth chose her victims well . They were almost always people who cared for her . <br> Normally being pelted by a chocolate Easter egg would n't be a big deal , but these were n't chocolate . They 'd made that mistake only once . A few years earlier , when the village of Three Pines first decided to have an egg hunt on Easter Sunday , there 'd been great excitement . The villagers met at Olivier 's Bistro and over drinks and Brie they divvied up bags of chocolate eggs to be hidden the next day . ' Ooohs ' and ' Aaaaahs ' tinged with envy filled the air . Would that they were children again . But their pleasure would surely come from seeing the faces of the village children . Besides , the kids might not find them all , especially those hidden behind Olivier 's bar . <br> ' They 're gorgeous . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then bit its head off . <br> ' Gabri . ' His partner Olivier yanked what was left of the goose from Gabri 's massive hand . ' They 're for the kids . ' <br> ' You just want it for yourself . ' Gabri turned to Myrna and muttered so that everyone could hear , ' Great idea . Gay men offering chocolates to children . Let 's alert the Moral Majority . ' <br> Blond and bashful , Olivier blushed furiously . <br> Myrna smiled . She looked like a massive Easter egg herself , black and oval and wrapped in a brilliant purple and red caftan . <br> Most of the tiny village was at the bistro , crowded around the long bar of polished wood , though some had flopped down in the comfortable old armchairs scattered about . All for sale . Olivier 's was also an antique shop . Discreet tags dangled from everything , including Gabri when he felt under-appreciated and under-applauded . <br> It was early April and fires crackled cheerily in the open grates , throwing warm light on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waiters moved effortlessly through the beamed room , offering drinks and soft , runny Brie from Monsieur PagT 's farm . The bistro was at the heart of the old Quebec village , sitting as it did on the edge of the green . On either side of it and attached by connecting doors were the rest of the shops , hugging the village in an aged brick embrace . Monsieur BTliveau 's general store , Sarah 's Boulangerie , then the bistro and finally , just off that , Myrna 's Livres , Neufs et UsagTs . Three craggy pine trees had stood at the far end of the green for as long as anyone remembered , like wise men who 'd found what they were looking for . Outward from the village , dirt roads radiated and meandered into the mountains and forests . <br> But Three Pines itself was a village forgotten . Time eddied and swirled and sometimes bumped into it , but never stayed long and never left much of an impression . For hundreds of years the village had nestled in the palm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found except by accident . Sometimes , a weary traveler crested the hill and looking down saw , like Shangri-La , the welcoming circle of old homes . Some were weathered fieldstone built by settlers clearing the land of deeply rooted trees and back-breaking stones . Others were red brick and built by United Empire Loyalists desperate for sanctuary . And some had the swooping metal roofs of the QuTbTcois home with their intimate gables and broad verandas . And at the far end was Olivier 's Bistro , offering cafT au lait and fresh-baked croissants , conversation and company and kindness . Once found , Three Pines was never forgotten . But it was only ever found by people lost . <br> Myrna looked over at her friend Clara Morrow , who was sticking out her tongue . Myrna stuck hers out too . Clara rolled her eyes . Myrna rolled hers , taking a seat beside Clara on the soft sofa facing the fireplace . <br> ' You were n't smoking garden mulch again while I was in Montreal , were you ? ' <br> ' Not this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nose . ' <br> Myrna felt around , found something and examined it . ' Mmm , it 's either chocolate , or skin . Only one way to find out . ' <br> She popped it in her mouth . <br> ' God . ' Clara winced . ' And you wonder why you 're single . ' <br> ' I do n't wonder . ' Myrna smiled . ' I do n't need a man to complete me . ' <br> ' Oh really ? What about Raoul ? ' <br> ' Ah , Raoul , ' said Myrna dreamily . ' He was a sweet . ' <br> ' He was a gummy bear , ' agreed Clara . <br> ' He completed me , ' said Myrna . ' And then some . ' She patted her middle , large and generous , like the woman herself . <br> ' Look at this . ' A razor voice cut through conversation . <br> Ruth Zardo stood in the center of the bistro holding aloft a chocolate rabbit as though it were a grenade . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alert , its face so real Clara half expected it to twitch its delicate candy whiskers . In its paws it held a basket woven from white and milk chocolate , and in that basket sat a dozen candy eggs , beautifully decorated . It was lovely and Clara prayed Ruth was n't about to toss it at someone . <br> ' It 's a bunny rabbit , ' snarled the elderly poet . <br> ' I eat them too , ' said Gabri to Myrna . ' It 's a habit . A rabbit habit . ' <br> Myrna laughed and immediately wished she had n't . Ruth turned her glare on her . <br> ' Ruth . ' Clara stood up and approached cautiously , holding her husband Peter 's Scotch as enticement . ' Let the bunny go . ' <br> It was a sentence she 'd never said before . <br> ' It 's a rabbit , ' Ruth repeated as though to slow children . ' So what 's it doing with these ? ' <br> She pointed to the eggs . <br> ' Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the bewildered villagers . ' Never thought of that , eh ? Where did it get them ? Presumably from chocolate chickens . The bunny must have stolen the eggs from candy chickens who 're searching for their babies . Frantic . ' <br> The funny thing was , as the old poet spoke Clara could actually imagine chocolate chickens running around desperate to find their eggs . Eggs stolen by the Easter bunny . <br> With that Ruth dropped the chocolate bunny to the floor , shattering it . <br> ' Oh , God , ' said Gabri , running to pick it up . ' That was for Olivier . ' <br> ' Really ? ' said Olivier , forgetting he himself had bought it . <br> ' This is a strange holiday , ' said Ruth ominously . ' I 've never liked it . ' <br> ' And now it 's mutual , ' said Gabri , holding the fractured rabbit as though an adored and wounded child . He 's so tender , thought Clara not for the first time . Gabri was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how sensitive he was . Until moments like these when he gently held a dying chocolate bunny . <br> ' How do we celebrate Easter ? ' the old poet demanded , yanking Peter 's Scotch from Clara and downing it . ' We hunt eggs and eat hot cross buns . ' <br> ' Mais , we go to St Thomas 's too , ' said Monsieur BTliveau . <br> ' More people go to Sarah 's Boulangerie than ever show up at church , ' snapped Ruth . ' They buy pastry with an instrument of torture on it . I know you think I 'm crazy , but maybe I 'm the only sane one here . ' <br> And on that disconcerting note she limped to the door , then turned back . <br> ' Do n't put those chocolate eggs out for the children . Something bad will happen . ' <br> And like Jeremiah , the weeping prophet , she was right . Something bad did happen . <br> Next morning the eggs had vanished . All that could be found were wrappers . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth , had sabotaged the event . <br> ' Look at this , ' said Peter , holding up the shredded remains of a chocolate bunny box . ' Teeth marks . And claws . ' <br> ' So it was Ruth , ' said Gabri , taking the box and examining it . <br> ' See here . ' Clara raced after a candy wrapper blowing across the village green . ' Look , it 's all ripped apart as well . ' <br> After spending the morning hunting Easter egg wrappers and cleaning up the mess , most villagers trudged back to Olivier 's to warm themselves by the fire . <br> ' Now , really , ' said Ruth to Clara and Peter over lunch at the bistro . ' Could n't you see that coming ? ' <br> ' I admit it seems obvious , ' Peter laughed , cutting into his golden croque-monsieur , the melted Camembert barely holding the maple-smoked ham and flaky croissant together . Around him anxious parents buzzed , trying to bribe crying children . <br> ' Every wild animal within miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ruth , slowly swirling the ice cubes in her Scotch . ' Eating Easter eggs . Foxes , raccoons , squirrels . ' <br> ' Bears , ' said Myrna , joining their table . ' Jesus , that 's pretty scary . All those starving bears , rising from their dens , ravenous after hibernating all winter . ' <br> ' Imagine their surprise to find chocolate eggs and bunnies , ' said Clara , between mouthfuls of creamy seafood chowder with chunks of salmon and scallops and shrimp . She took a crusty baguette and twisted off a piece , spreading it with Olivier 's special sweet butter . ' The bears must have wondered what miracle had happened while they slept . ' <br> ' Not everything that rises up is a miracle , ' said Ruth , lifting her eyes from the amber liquid , her lunch , and looking out the mullioned windows . ' Not everything that comes back to life is meant to . This is a strange time of year . Rain one day , snow the next . Nothing 's certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unpredictable , ' said Peter . ' Hurricanes in fall , snowstorms in winter . ' <br> ' But you 've just proved my point , ' said Ruth . ' You can name the threat . We all know what to expect in other seasons . But not spring . The worst flooding happens in spring . Forest fires , killing frosts , snowstorms and mud slides . Nature 's in turmoil . Anything can happen . ' <br> ' The most achingly beautiful days happen in spring too , ' said Clara . <br> ' True , the miracle of rebirth . I hear whole religions are based on the concept . But some things are better off buried . ' The old poet got up and downed her Scotch . ' It 's not over yet . The bears will be back . ' <br> ' I would be too , ' said Myrna , ' if I 'd suddenly found a village made of chocolate . ' <br> Clara smiled , but her eyes were on Ruth , who for once did n't radiate anger or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Fear . Copyright 2007 Louise Penny .
