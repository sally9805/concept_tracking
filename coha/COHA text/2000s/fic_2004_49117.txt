George Guthridge was a frequent contributor to the sf magazines back in the 1980s . In the early " 90s , he cowrote the three novels in The Madagascar Manifesto with Janet Berliner-Gluckman . Nowadays his efforts go into teaching primarily-he teaches in multiple disciplines at the University of Alaska and has won several national honors . At the moment , he 's marketing a book called Island on the Edge of Forever about his experiences in coaching Eskimo students to three national championships in academics . Originally from Washington state , George has lived in rural Alaska for many years and brings a lot of experience to bear in this near-future speculation on whether our flag will have fifty stars for much longer ... <p> Northern Alaska : Point Barrow .

A sign tells them they can photograph a work in progress but not the artist , yet with a wry smile and workgnarled fingers he beckons picture-seekers forward . Closer , his fingers gesture , - closer . When the camera lens is almost against the log , he gently removes the camera and , following his lead , the viewers put an ear against the odorous wood . Listen to its voices , he seems to say . Everyone loves him - until the day when he unveils his two newest totems . No photos , no touching , no listening to the wood .

Wordless , he stands holding the tether , face red with rash , not rage : like many other Tlingits , he is lactose-intolerant , yet that has n't stopped him from bingeing on pizza . He watches the totem instead of the colorful whirling robes of the Tsirnshian dancers wearing bird masks and furred boots , seems to listen only to the wind rather than to the drumming and singing , the speeches , the polite applause .

The veil falls , revealing ... nothing . The crowd starts forward - something was holding up the silk , the remaining ropes attach to som ething-then realizes there is a totem ... one that , except for the barest refraction of light , is almost invisible . They run their hands over the familiar figures , murmuring approval . " " Air-gel , " he tells her . " Solid , but unseen . Like my people . And , like my people , damn expensive .

From the summit , Governor Diedre Stuck - Didi to her friends - looks out at the lesser peaks , bathed in alpenglow . Between them , glaciers lie like white rivers , their dark ragged crevasses evident even from this height , their width rendering miniature the real rivers far below , silver with snowmelt . Mulling the mountain - and the mountainous decision she faces after her descent - she feels a deep kinship with those who have gone before . The first ascent had been of the north and slightly shorter peak - scaled not by professional climbers but by four sourdough miners , subsisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging a fourteen-foot larch pole up with them , to be erected into wild winds at the 19,000 foot level , wrongly reasoning that it could be seen from Fairbanks and thus prove their accomplishment . In 1913 , an Athabascan , together with her ex 's great-great grandfather , the Reverend Hudson Stuck - whose writings brought the mountain to the American imagination - were two summiteers of the higher south peak . Exactly a century before her own climb , this one originally timed for her political map - but now , she hopes with more than a little remorse at that earlier unthinking ambition , the goal purely personal . The wind is barely a whisper , everything eerily calm . Their initial hurrahs over , she and the other six in her party - climbing , not political , they had teased her on the way up - are silent . Perhaps , she tells herself , like her they feel they are in the center of a storm . She closes her eyes . Denali , she murmurs as though in prayer , reveling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her sunburned lips seeming to move as of their own accord . Reality intrudes . They 've even tried to take our mountain away , she reminds herself . Officially named for a man who never set foot in Alaska , nor probably wanted to . For her the mountain will always be Denali . An anagram , she realizes with a bitterness that surprises her , for denial . The team leader tugs her rope , indicating with a mittened hand that it is time to return to the world below . Her breath catches in her throat - as much from attitude as altitude . This would be a good day to die , it abruptly occurs to her ; and the best place . Another gesture of the mittened hand sloughs away her naivete . Several thousand feet below , snow and spindrift have begun to blow along knife edges . A whiteout , coming without warning . Typical for Denali . Assuming they make it down safely , worsening weather will ground the Chinook coming to pluck her from the rescue/medical camp at 17,000 feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to sign or veto the secession bill . Either choice means political suicide . Sign - the feds will slice and dice her . Veto , and her fellow Alaskans will . She knows that , unlike crazies who wish to found their own America for whatever reason , many - now most - Alaskans have long wanted to rescind the statehood choice made in the heady Cold War competition of " 59 . But the Civil War decided secession legality , if it really resolved little else . Had n't its last battle been fought not in the South but here in Alaska , two whaling ships battling it out , not knowing the war was over ? But until now , no state had challenged the feds on the question of a state 's right to refuse to participate . Like Melville 's Baitleby , she thinks , remembering the writer who also had been a whaler , we prefer not to .

Unofficially , they already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , as brutal as the Sun against her cheeks . Here , the Independence Party has long been not fringe but near the heart of the state , having seated a governor back in the " 90s and any number of the state 's other political leaders . Disgust began in earnest with Clinton 's attempt to keep Alaskans from selling lumber overseas . It seethed when senators from back East , wooing the environmental vote by damaging another state 's economy , led the charge against ANWR but refused even to visit Alaska , perhaps fearing to pop their Hollywood vision of pristine wilderness that in reality was 2000 acres of tundra - a euphemism for muddy marsh - in a state where that was barely a backyard , where forest fires ten times that were considered minor and ones a hundred times larger not unknown . She knows that Alaskan ire did not boil , though , until Congress imposed price controls on oil following the Iranian invasion . America needed to break her dependence on foreign fuel ; Alaska would have to ante up . Alaskans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could wilderness : it was up to the rest of America to determine Alaska 's destiny . Keep your mind on the mountain , she tells herself , fighting to concentrate as she starts down the ridge , testing each footfall with a hard-pressed heel , using the haft of her axe for added balance . Mind and body rapidly deteriorate above 17,200 feet ; she keeps imagining days in the state legislature this past year . Listening to the Anchorage senator pontificate about how the Alaska Permanent Fund meant that the state could print its own money . And the woman from Nome who continually reminded everyone that Alaska is the most strategic missile site in the northern hemisphere . And then the scientist from the University of Alaska Fairbanks who announced the harnessing of the aurora , with its inexhaustible energy - not voicing what many already knew : its compacted power would dwarf that of the hydrogen bomb . Finally the vote came , her urgings to the contrary . She reminded the legislature that the feds and the media were treating the proposed secession with respectful bemusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Alaska 's long winter . America , she insisted , would never loosen its grip on Alaskan oil . Nor now , its hold on their heart song , the aurora borealis .... The wind rises , snow needling her cheeks . When the leader calls a halt and tells everyone they have to move fast or risk being blown off the ridge , fear gives her new clarity . Stooped , her weight upon the axe , she adjusts the weight of her pack , takes what deep breath she can manage and mentally prepares herself , glancing around at what peaks she can still see . Her ex 's ancestor , Hudson Stuck , was right , she tells herself . Denali is the window of Heaven . Setting her sights on following the next Alaskan 's lead , she descends into the maelstrom .

Culturels to be perpetuated , not preserved , she wants to say , but they will not understand , though they will convince themselves they do . Doctorates depend on it . Today she is not at home - which is always disorderly , opposite of the natural world . Nor have they sucked her into Anchorage , where the sterility of the Pioneer Home awaits if her health continues to fail .

Were it not for Smith , the day would be fine . " Enjoying yourself ? " he asks . He smiles down at her , straightens her blanket .

She rests the gun across her lap , waiting for the seal to resurface . " Is this a good idea ? " Smith asks . His smile reminds her of someone trying to suppress a turd . " Love seal , " she says . " Is it a good idea to shoot one ? I mean , at your age ? " She raises the rifle and sights down the barrel , reveling in the heft . So many years since she fired it .

" Rather like the matter of the bones . " " Want the bones back . " She still is sighting down the rifle . " We 're well aware of that , Mrs. Nelson . Lot 3776 , a total of thirty Eyak bones .

We alway know that . " Mr. Young reaches for the gun just as she shifts - and shoots . Smith drops the cigarette . She snaps on the safety , lays the gun across her lap .

My finest possession , he thinks . It means more to him than does his commercial boat , Aleut Pride , or his baidarka . The comparison , he knows , is moot . An Anchorage couple drove the Pride away , to convert it to a houseboat. he sold it for a song . The baidarka , which he handcrafted with native materials , is bound for the museum in Unalaska . And he - bound for life elsewhere . He hates himself for not having anticipated the inevitable . Any fool could see that the fishing was not going to last , especially with the advent of farmed fish . he remembers how he laughed aloud at that Anchorage guy who suggested that farmed fish would usurp the industry . Even more painfully , he remembers his wife 's and daughter 's tears the day they left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely symbolic . He left her years ago , she insisted , although they shared the same house . When he said the same bed , she shook her head . Merely symbolic , she said . It was a favorite phrase of hers , ever since she took that college class . The Frankenfish - those were not symbolic . Created in an experimental hatchery on Canada 's Prince Edward Island , Atlantic salmon had been modified to carry a growth-hormone gene from the Pacific chinook . Ecologists had warned that transgenic salmon could wipe out natural populations , since the chance of farmed salmon escaping from netted pens in shallow coastal waters was 100 percent . Other escaped farmed species had quickly outnumbered their wild counterparts . The size of the Frankenfish , scientists warned , could disrupt the ecology of salmon streams by competing with native fish for resources ; studies showed that Frankenfish mated with native fish in high numbers but produced offspring that did not survive as well : it took only forty generations for the genetically modified fish , GM fish , to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquaculturalists created sterile salmon . As predicted , some escaped . Glenno snorts as he unties the torpedo and lowers it to the floor , remembering the first of the GM fish he netted . Bigger than even the doomsayers imagined . The GM fish had not competed with native species for resources - they ate native species . Fifteen-pound silvers were merely herring . he had seen kings four or five times that with hunks gone where Frankenfish attacked them . Nor were GM fish commercially viable . Only sports fishermen bothered with them , and then only aficionados who practiced catch-andrelease . American shoppers wanted to eat genetically altered fish about as much as they wanted a nuclear power plant in their backyard . He runs a hand over the torpedo 's rusty surface .

His father dismantled that part before hoisting it aboard the Pride . Ransacking shelves , he locates a soup can , trims it with shears to hold a 12-gauge shell - but thinks better of it . Too much like African Queen , he decides . Imitating Bogart might be considered symbolic . Remembering the movie , he wonders if she read the book . He wonders if there was a book . He opens the boathouse door . Though he has more than enough room to pull out the baidarka , he opens the door fully , framing the ship in the distance .
