The Sopranos Every now and then , David Chase will open up the newspaper and suddenly feel the old crackle of inspiration that kept The Sopranos alive and electrifying for eight years . " I 'll see a story about some bit of Mob business and go , " Oh , that would have been a great story for us , ' ' " he says . " Sure , I miss it . " Five months have passed since that " Do n't Stop Believin ' ' " finale , in which Tony , Carmela , AJ , and Meadow gathered for a late ( and last ? ) supper , only to be interrupted by a smashing , baffling cut to black . Show creator Chase still bristles at what he calls the " twisted desire " of those who wanted to see Tony get rubbed out . But he does n't buy into the **32;5232;TOOLONG theory , either . " I do think therapy helped Tony , " says Chase , " but it was never going to " cure " him of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that was bada bing ! about the show to begin with . Chase , truly the godfather of today 's watercooler TV , puts it this way : " I always liked hearing how there would be these dinner parties , where people would have ziti , watch the show , and talk about it afterwards . Knowing we had viewers like that emboldened us and challenged us to create a richer , deeper show . " And now  --  smash to black  --  the party 's over . angelina Jolie " I do n't think there was ever a day I was sure of what I was doing  --  only that I knew my heart was in the right place . " Angelina Jolie is currently fulfilling fanboy fantasies in Beowulf with her role as Grendel 's mom . Grendel 's naked mom . In digital 3-D , no less . But energizing her base is hardly the 32-year-old actress ' only accomplishment this year . In A Mighty Heart , Jolie strapped on a prosthetic pregnancy belly , donned a curly wig , and delivered the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Award ( for 1999 's Girl , Interrupted ) in the first place . In other words , she acted . " The belly just slid right on , and a wig is a lot easier than getting your hair done , but learning her French-Cuban accent was difficult , " Jolie says , describing her preparations for playing Mariane Pearl , widow of Daniel Pearl , the Wall Street Journal reporter slain in Pakistan in 2002 During the five weeks she shot the picture with director Michael Winterbottom in India  --  mostly in one house , with a camera following her from room to room as she sometimes improvised dialogue  --  Jolie was hounded by paparazzi , and a terrorist group reportedly declared a fatwa against her during production . " It was n't like a code red or anything , " she says , " but we did have a few moments ... " Whatever happened in India  --  and whatever she 's wearing in Beowulf  --  her performances in 2007 were far more interesting than her private life . A nice change of pace . will Smith " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been aware of how a movie affects people beyond entertaining them . I have a deep spiritual yearning for my movies to mean something . I 'm jonesing for more of that connection . " The beginning of the year was particularly cold for Will Smith . First , there was the frigid business of taking over the Brooklyn Bridge in January to shoot his upcoming sci-fi opus I Am Legend . Then there was the experience of losing the Best Actor Oscar ( he was nominated for The Pursuit of Happyness  --  his first blockbuster drama , at nearly $163 million ) to The Last King of Scotland 's Forest Whitaker . Of course , Smith suspected he was n't going home with hardware . " If you want to win an Oscar , you need to play a historical figure , or someone who 's mentally ill , " he says with a laugh . " So the moment I saw that Forest was playing both , I knew I had no chance . " Still , an Oscar nomination ( his second , after 2001 's Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Legend set to open huge next month , a strong finish seems in store , too . All things considered , this Smith-bracketed 2007 was a showcase for the star 's Hanksian range and popularity . Next year might be another big one : Hancock  --  a superhero comedy and another blend of what he calls " popcorn and prestige "  --  is slated for next summer . " To me , there 's absolutely no award better than people going to your movie in record levels , " he says . " People who spend their hard-earned money to go see your movie  --  I 'll take that any day of the week . " tommy Lee Jones " I remember really good meals that I 've had in Tennessee and France , and I remember the quality of the lights in a particular movie shot . But no , I do n't remember having any favorite roles . " Not many actors do more by doing less than Tommy Lee Jones . And 2007 might mark a career high for the 61-year-old actor , who delivered extraordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films , In the Valley of Elah and No Country for Old Men . In both , he plays typical Tommy Lee Jones characters  --  a bottled-up ex  --  Army guy chasing down his soldier son 's murderers in Elah ; a seen-it-all sheriff on the trail of a cowboy thief in No Country  --  but this time , his material is richer than usual . Jones ' uniquely taciturn way of cutting open his grizzled characters has connected on screen as it rarely has before  --  not just once , but twice . " I had a feeling that the potential for these movies to be good existed , but that 's only because I 've made so many bad movies , " Jones says , chuckling . " But every job you just try to do as well as you can , whether it 's a comedy or a tragedy or a soft-drink commercial in Japan . " The actor , whose scary but droll gruffness on screen is exactly what you 'll encounter in person , is pleased that people like his work this year , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being excoriated , or being dragged behind the pickup with a rope around your neck , " he says . " It 's been a fine , good year . " That would be an understatement , and it would be totally in character . Cable queens Glenn Close Mary-Louise Parker Kyra Sedgwick Holly Hunter Not long ago , if you said the phrase " strong female character , " what you really meant was " bitch . " Today , however , you 'd mean a powerful , complex figure who 's flawed but fascinating . The actress this description calls for does n't fit into any box  --  except , at last , the TV . Kyra Sedgwick ( TNT 's " The Closer ' ' ) , Mary-Louise Parker ( Showtime 's " Weeds ' ' ) , Holly Hunter ( TNT 's " Saving Grace ' ' ) , and Glenn Close ( FX 's " Damages ' ' ) are four extraordinary film vets who have embraced the challenges of their latest provocative roles on the small screen . Here , a tribute to the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in terror that it wo n't be so exciting year after year , but so far it 's been great , " says Sedgwick , who plays Brenda Johnson , a criminal interrogator ( and sugar addict ) extraordinaire . After three seasons , the character has really gotten under her skin . " At this point , she 's sort of taken over me , " explains the actress , who says she now tends to let go and hand the reins over to Brenda to " just see what happens . " The Golden Globe winner has a little advice for those looking to forge a career in series television : " Make sure you get involved with sane , wonderful people , " she says . " Because if they 're crazy now , they 're gon na be crazy four years from now . " Mary-Louise Parker Weeds " I think it just all thins out there the older you get . " Parker 's not talking hair , she 's talking movie scripts : There are n't many offered to women in their 40s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weeds was that she 'd recently had her first child and wanted steady hours . But do n't go thinking motherhood has dampened her resolve to push Nancy Botwin  --  the devoted mom and suburban drug kingpin she plays  --  to extremes . " I want to take her as far as I can , " she says . " I probably would n't be able to take off my panties and put my stuff in Matthew Modine 's face on any other channel , y'know ? " Holly Hunter Saving Grace " It would not have been possible for this show to be on the air 10 years ago , maybe not even five years ago , " marvels Hunter , who credits Tony Soprano and The Shield 's Vic Mackey with paving the way for Grace Hanadarko , her alcoholic , adulterous police detective in spiritual crisis . " You ca n't have antiheroines without the guys going first . " And the Oscar winner ( 1993 's The Piano ) clearly relishes the role . " The rawness appeals to me , " she says . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes everything . That changes the taste of the whole dish . " Glenn Close Damages " I guess putting women at the head of something is considered risky , " says Close , who does n't understand all the fuss over today 's new women-on-top trend in television . " I 'm amused by the whole antiheroine thing because to me it 's just women acting like men . " And as Patty Hewes , the masterfully manipulative  --  and perhaps murderous  --  New York litigator , the five-time Oscar nominee uses the masculine approach to outdo even her infamous Alex Forrest , making the Fatal Attraction bunny boiler seem like Doris Day . " Alex would be putty in Patty 's hands , " Close says . Reference See also introduction on page 33 of same issue . See also related article on page 108 of same issue .
