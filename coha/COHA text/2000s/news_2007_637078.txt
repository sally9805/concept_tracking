<p> The Piedmont Park that will host a projected 250,000 people this weekend at the Atlanta Dogwood Festival will have a lot more elbow room in a few years if the group that oversees the park can pull off an ambitious expansion plan . <p> The Piedmont Park Conservancy this week unveiled a $72 million plan to improve 53 acres of parkland that never was accessible to the general public . Once complete , the park 's northern tip would offer trails next to a creek , a skate park with concessions and a playground accessible to handicapped children and adults . <p> " The path will go through a beautiful meadow surrounded by a hardwood forest , and as you go through the forest you 're following this beautiful woodland creek with granite outcroppings , " said Debbie McCown , president and CEO of the Piedmont Park Conservancy . " Where else in the city can you go and feel like you 're in the North Georgia mountains ? " <p> The project is to kick off this autumn with a proposed construction budget of up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 acres of rolling forests and fields that are to be reclaimed from kudzu and trash . A half-mile of Clear Creek , which does n't live up to its name , will be cleared of debris and a concrete lining that covers the outcroppings . Construction is to start early next year and be finished by 2010 . <p> Visitors will be able to freshen up after their treks with a dip in two new pools to be built , starting soon after Labor Day . Piedmont Park 's historic bath house is to be renovated into an energy efficient building with restrooms , showers , changing rooms and spaces for programs , exhibits and events . <p> Another option for visitors is to play in a new water fountain , similar to the rings of fountains at Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta . Construction is likely to begin after 2010 . <p> " I get goose bumps thinking about all of it , " McCown said . " Let 's get it done . " <p> The plan was generally endorsed by Doug Abramson , a Midtown resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botanical Garden and the city over the construction of a parking deck in Piedmont Park . <p> " Things are moving in a good direction , " Abramson said of the conservancy 's plan . " But the more the public knows , the better . " <p> The grand plans are contingent upon raising the money . <p> Atlanta ca n't afford to maintain Piedmont Park at its present standard , let alone expand it . So the Piedmont Park Conservancy has stepped up with its $72 million capital campaign . The conservancy is one of several nonprofit groups in Atlanta that maintain attractions that are beyond the city 's means . The Georgia Aquarium is run by a nonprofit entity , as is Zoo Atlanta . <p> McCown knows the conservancy 's fund-raising program is just the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field of capital campaigns in Atlanta . Campaigns for a total of more than $350 million are under way for projects including a new symphony hall , civil and human rights center , greenways for the Beltline , and to pay off the $32 million acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> McCown said she 's " absolutely confident " the conservancy will raise the money . <p> It helps that more than $22 million has been pledged from Atlanta and influential community leaders . <p> " We 've got the leadership and the staff in place , " McCown said . " We have the experience , the plan and the confidence of our donors . So I really do think it is our time . We chose this time to announce the leadership and lead gifts , and we 're very pleased with the strength of these first lead gifts . " <p> The conservancy 's plan for the park calls for two stages of work . <p> McCown compares it to decorating a tree at holiday season : " We plant the tree in the first phase and add ornaments in phase two . " <p> The reclamation project will begin by clearing out debris and overgrowth . Then work begins simultaneously on smoothing the land , blazing trails and installing streetlights , an irrigation system and plants . The goal is to finish in early 2010 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are to be completed between now and then . <p> Ideas include a skate park and concessions at the north end of the new parkland , near Ansley Mall . Plots of land will be sectioned off and leased to condo dwellers and others who want to grow vegetables and flowers . An asphalt parking lot near the tennis courts will be torn up and replaced with grass and trees . <p> McCown is proud of the plan and expects the expansion will help Piedmont Park meet the varying recreational needs of Atlanta 's diverse population . <p> " Everyone loves this park and everyone has a different idea of what it should be , " McCown said . " Our role is to protect and restore the park to the needs of the community . This project will provide people with an unimpeded experience of walking on trails from 10th Street to Piedmont Avenue . It 's astounding . " <p> CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARK EFFORT <p> * $10 million challenge grant , the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation <p> * $5 million challenge grant , the Arthur M.
