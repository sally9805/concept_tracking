<p> It only took a few seconds after Clarence Ray Allen walked into the heavily glassed , apple-green death chamber in San Quentin State Prison at precisely 12:05 a.m . Tuesday to figure out that this was not going to be the pitiable execution many had predicted . <p> At 76 , the quadruple murderer was the oldest man ever executed in California . Allen was said to be so ill from 23 years on Death Row with heart trouble and diabetes that he was blind , nearly deaf and could not walk . And indeed , when the oval door of the death chamber clanged open to begin the procedure , he was in a wheelchair . <p> But then he stood up . <p> The four guards alongside him  --  two on each side  --  put their hands under his shoulders and elbows to help him , but when his feet moved forward it was clear they did so on their own power . His portly face , pasty from living decades inside a cell , showed no pain as he walked five short steps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burly man , but when he put his thin arms on the sides of the gurney , he had little difficulty hoisting himself up  --  again , with some help  --  and lying flat . And once he 'd been strapped down and fit with the needles that would inject poisons into his tattooed arms , he vigorously craned his head and made eye contact with several people in the semicircular witness area that surrounds the metal death chamber . <p> He smiled broadly , calling out first " Where are you ? " and then " I love you " as he raised his head several times to gaze at ex-daughter-in-law Kathy Allen and four other supporters . They smiled back , and when one of the women waved , he nodded his head . <p> It all appeared contrary to the impression given by his backers for months that he was an old man so feeble he would be unable to see anything and would probably have to be carried to the gurney . Such robust ability in someone whose eyesight was compromised by diabetes and who suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised some in the witness room  --  but not prison officials . <p> " No shock to those of us who knew him , " said San Quentin spokesman Vernell Crittendon , who also witnessed the execution and all 12 others that preceded Allen 's since the state resumed executing inmates in 1992 . " I 've watched him walk and read his own mail for a long time now . " <p> That 's just exaggerating , retorted Lynne Coffin , a lawyer who watched with Allen 's relatives to give them support . <p> " The way I saw it , that chamber is so small all he had to do was stand up , turn around and lie down , " Coffin , a former state public defender , said Tuesday afternoon . " As far as the blindness is concerned , we always tell inmates what direction they should look to see their loved ones . That 's all he was doing  --  <p> looking the direction he was told to . " <p> Back and forths aside , one overriding truth was plain . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Allen met his doom the way he 'd wanted to : with the faint lilt of American Indian chants ringing in the air , sacred objects placed close to his heart and loved ones to comfort him as his damaged vision faded to black . <p> A symbolic , gray eagle feather lay on his chest for the entire 33-minute execution , rising and falling until poisons stopped his breathing . <p> " Hoka Hey , it 's a good day to die , " Allen , who turned 76 on Monday , wrote in his last statement , handed to the warden after his last meal of buffalo steak , pecan pie and black walnut ice cream . " Hoka Hey " is a traditional Indian saying meaning , " It 's a good day to die . " <p> Those whose lives he savaged by ordering up the shotgun deaths of their loved ones in Fresno in 1980 looked as if they could n't have agreed more . <p> Patricia Pendergrass , whose 27-year-old brother Bryon Schletewitz died when Allen 's hit man blasted him in the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly from start to finish  --  and then , as the official notice of his death was read , she allowed herself the hint of a smile . Five chairs to her right in the ring of witnesses sitting at a railing alongside the death chamber , prosecutor Ward Campbell lifted his chin as if in victory . <p> Allen was referred to as a white man when he went to prison , but his Choctaw and Cherokee roots took on great importance in the final years of his life  --  and both his appearance Tuesday morning and the fact that he requested that his two spiritual advisers in the witness room be American Indians testified to that . <p> He came into the death chamber with his long gray hair flowing to the middle of his back and held tight by a beaded headband of green , yellow and red . Around his neck was a white beaded necklace with an amulet . He held the eagle feather , with white leather strips trailing off one end , in his manacled hands , and before he was lashed down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seven prison guards who spent from 12:05 to 12:17 a.m. fastening him to the gurney and inserting catheters in each arm  --  the right needle digging in next to an eagle tattoo  --  moved gingerly around the feather as they did their work . Unlike the execution last month of Stanley Tookie Williams , the needle insertion went smoothly , taking just seven minutes instead of 13 , each point sliding home easily . <p> After taping his hands down to the gurney arms , the guards swiveled Allen a half-turn so he could see his supporters along the western wall of the room . Then they left , sealing the converted gas chamber 's oval door . It was 12:17 a.m . <p> At 12:19 , a death warrant was shoved through a porthole into the witness room , and a guard read it loudly , the words cutting jarringly through the silent crowd . " The execution shall now proceed , " she barked . <p> In short order , unseen hands from behind the execution chamber walls sent three chemicals through the lines attached to the needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep , pancuronium bromide to stop his breathing and potassium chloride to stop his heart . A cardiac monitor attached to his chest registered him dead at 12:38  --  about five minutes longer than usual for the chemicals to work  --  and Warden Steven Ornoski later said the staff had to send in a second salvo of potassium chloride . <p> " Basically , this guy 's heart has been beating for 76 years , and it took awhile for it to stop , " he explained . Two other executions have required the same treatment . <p> While the strapping , inserting and injecting unfolded , the 50 witnesses watched mostly stoically , none speaking out loud . The quiet was broken , eerily , by the distant sound of Indian chants about halfway through the execution when 300 protesters at the eastern gate of the prison , several blocks away , sent their drumming and chanting through a loudspeaker system . Through the thick stone walls of the execution room , their strains rang dimly for several minutes . <p> Over on the two-tier set of risers where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution chamber the whole while , clearly displeased with what she was seeing . Kathy Allen looked grief-stricken and managed weak smiles only when Allen looked her way . <p> On the opposite wall were 17 media witnesses , and along the wall between the two groups were state officials and people who appeared to be relatives of Allen 's victims . <p> The railing right in front of the window of the death chamber was reserved for the prison 's highest-priority guests for the evening : seven relatives of the three people whose slayings sent Allen to Death Row : Schletewitz , Josephine Rocha , 17 , and Douglas White , 20 . The fourth person whose killing Allen masterminded  --  Mary Sue Kitts , 17 when she was strangled in 1974  --  reportedly had no representatives there because Allen 's life prison term for her slaying predated his capital sentence in the killing of the other three . <p> The murders were related , though . Allen had ordered Kitts killed because she told Schletewitz that Allen had led a burglary of the Schletewitz family store in Fresno , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that murder , Allen met fellow inmate Billie Ray Hamilton  --  and when Hamilton was paroled , Allen hired him to go after Schletewitz and seven others who testified against him , promising him $25,000 to slay them all . <p> When the killer  --  later sent to Death Row himself  --  caught up with his first mark , Schletewitz , as he closed out his shift at Fran 's Market one night in 1980 , Rocha and White had the awful luck of also being on shift . <p> White 's aunt and uncle sat in two chairs Tuesday . Rocha 's sister sat in another . <p> Pendergrass , 55 , had probably the best vantage point in the room , sitting in a chair 4 feet from Allen 's face . In her clenched hands , she held a small picture of her slain brother and a tiny pewter angel with " Peace " stamped into it . <p> " The whole time , I kept thinking of Bryon , and my parents , who waited so long for this day but have passed away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I made a promise to my parents and myself that I would watch this execution , so I kept my eyes on his face every second . " <p> Her face betrayed emotion only twice , and one of those times was when she let that small smile slip as the death warrant was read . The other came right after that . <p> In the stony stillness just before the witness room was cleared , she finally tore her eyes from Allen 's now-dead face and stared at the ground . But before her eyes dropped , they shone like fire  --  a blazing gaze reflecting the knowledge that yes , the moment for which she had hungered for 25 years had finally come . <p> " It just hit me at that second , " she said . " My mission was accomplished . I could finally take my eyes off him forever . He 's gone . <p> " I 'm still getting used to the idea , " she said quietly .
