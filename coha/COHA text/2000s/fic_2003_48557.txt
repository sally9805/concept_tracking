J. GUESS WE 'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT ? " <p> he poked his fried egg with his fork . " Tonight ? " <p> She looked at her own plate . Almost empty . A scrap of sausage , a piece of biscuit . She wondered how she could have eaten at all-much less everything . She remembered a time twenty years ago she 'd sat across from him in a booth like this and sneaked food off her plate into her napkin to hide the fact she could n't eat at all . That was love . <p> This was worse . <p> And yet she could eat . The whole Number 4 . She nodded . " Whatever you- ? " <p> " I want to , just not now . OK ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " There 's not a whole lot more than I told you on the phone . The bone scan 's Wednesday . " <p> " Yeah . Well .

She wiped it with her napkin . <p> " Always a mess , " she said with a small laugh . " Bad cup-lip coordination . " <p> " Always has been . " <p> " No , no . There was a long time . The time we were n't together ? I was noted for my agility . " <p> " Agile and coordinated . " <p> " Graceful and dexterous . " <p> " You were a juggler . " <p> " All those years . In my late forties , I was a dancer . " <p> " Oh , so only when I 'm in your life . . . " <p> " And a tennis player ... " <p> " I remember that part . You were playing a little tennis when we broke up . I think- " <p> " I started juggling right after that . . . but my partner dropped all the balls ... " <p> They were good at banter .

A woman was mopping the floor where they 'd been sitting . Another woman was spraying and swiping the tables . The air was disinfectant . She realized there was no one else in the diner . It was odd . It had been full of people when they were ordering their brunch . She remembered the Asian family across from , them . She 'd seen black couples as they 'd walked to the empty booth . Their waitress was a pale , gap-toothed country girl . He 'd liked that , the mix of people . he tried to find places to eat in the South like this diner , or ethnic restaurants like the ones he took her to around Boston . He 'd introduced her to places she 'd never been in her own hometown . <p> " Are you closing ? " she asked the lady with big hair who was clearing the cash register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then gave her a big , lipsticky smile . " Winter ? We close at two on Saturdays . " <p> When she mentioned it to him , walking to the car , he said it was a law . <p> " Huh ? What are you talking about ? " She could n't remember what she 'd just told him . <p> " The law-closing at two on Saturdays . " <p> " What law ? " <p> " In Virginia you can only have public diversity half a day . " <p> " Oh , James , " she said with a quick laugh , pulling up the hood of her jacket . Usually she would have played the game with him , batting something back like " Only Confederates in the afternoon , " but today she could n't think . <p> he took the wheel of her car . She shivered , turned the heat blower to high even though its air was still cold . They were going to Old Dominion Camera Store for something he needed for his camera . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to half its size since one-hour development . he was an amateur photographer who loved black-and-white pictures-gritty , disturbing urban pictures , natural light . he loved the work of ... of somebody else she could n't remember . He 'd taken her to the man 's show in Boston ; he 'd given her the catalog . She knew nothing about the subject . She hated some of the pictures and their invasion of people 's lives . She thought of being poor , or sick , or in emotional chaos-and having some stranger stick a camera in your face . <p> Though she was a visual artist , photography was not an interest they had in common-books were . They loaded each other with books , book reviews , book news . he seemed to read everything in the media on literary matters and e-mailed her copies he thought she 'd like . he watched C-SPAN2 and taped it in case she was watching The Simpsons ; she called him Alan Bookspan . <p> Now she was forcing herself to do it , but it was natural for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished Sophie 's Choice . " <p> " After twenty years ? " <p> " Oh , James , " she said . " For the thing honoring Styron at- " <p> " What 'd you think ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she said . <p> " That 's all ? " <p> " Yeah . Oh , turn here . Roseneath will get us to Carytown . " <p> The camera store was in Carytown , an old part of Richmond . It was closed . Closed at one o'clock on Saturdays , said the sign on the door . They got back in her car . he did n't make a joke about Saturday closings down south , but she knew he was thinking it . <p> " Where now ? " he said . <p> She tried to think of something to do . If only it was n't so cold-the park near here would be beige and leafless , a cutting wind off Byrd Lake . And James did n't like to walk so much as he used to . Both secondhand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . What she 'd really like to do is go sit in a dark bar like old times , before he quit . Drink and talk , in the dark . <p> " A movie ? " she asked . <p> " I do n't think so . . . " he turned to her for the first time today . He did n't start the engine . Then he spoke gravely : " Do you think anyone survived the Holocaust ? " <p> " What ? " She was confused . What had they been talking about that prompted this ? " What do you mean ? " <p> " I think ... I do n't know . I do n't know what I mean . " <p> want to . " She passed that sign three times a week on her way to teach her drawing class . She 'd begun noticing it when school started . She 'd never given a thought to going where the sign pointed . <p> " Tell me where it is on Roseneath , " he said , taking her hand after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few blocks around the corner . A smaller sign pointed to a plain two-story building behind the synagogue . he turned into the parking lot , empty but for a single car . <p> " I thought there 'd be a lot of people , that they 'd be coming for services . " <p> " I guess I did , too , " he said . " Must be in the evening . " <p> " I bet the museum 's closed on Saturday afternoon . " <p> " It looks like it . " They sat for a moment with the motor running ; then he switched it off . " I 'll go check . " <p> She watched him in his old winter jacket , his Basque beret , walk toward the nondescript building where the small sign on Roseneath had pointed VIRGINIA HOLOCAUST MUSEUM . he tried a door on the side , then walked back . he walked with a tilt she remembered from when they 'd been lovers in their thirties . he walked the same at sixty , but now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both been alive during the Holocaust , during the war . They had both been little children , safe in America . <p> " It 's open , " he mouthed as he walked back to the car , gesturing for her to come on . <p> Her heart sank . Instead of talking about what was happening to him , to them , they were going to visit this empty building that claimed to be a museum . <p> he pushed open the heavy metal door where a small , handwritten sign said ENTRANCE TO MUSEUM . Inside , the walls were beige cinderblock and tile . There was a long hall , a staircase with round metal banisters . It looked like an elementary school . It must , in fact , have been a school . It was empty now , and silent . Another written sign was taped to the walls by the stair : MUSEUM with a crayoned arrow pointing up . She wanted to turn around and leave . This place was like the dreams she 'd been having , dreams of hallways , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange exam in an unnumbered room upstairs . <p> " Hey , wait , " she called . <p> But he had already headed up the steps . She followed him . <p> At the top was a glass display case , on its surface a jar of dollars , a stack of brochures , and a guestbook . Beyond it were two mannequins-on the look of someone who 's looking at you but listening to another voice . he had looked that way all day . <p> On the landing , on a low shelf , there were sculptures featuring shards of glass and a desecrated Torah , a few artifacts including a Jewish storefront sign from Berlin and a couple of old envelopes with glass fragments arranged around them . There were several black-and-white photographs of smug vandals and shattered store windows . There was not really much to regard , but the voice on the tape was eloquent as it described the night in 1938 when throughout Germany every Jewish building was trashed and looted-the crystal proclamation of what was to come . But it was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come . <p> Then they were told to proceed up a few more steps and push open a picketed iron gate that blocked the second-floor hallway . The wrought German words across its top were translated by the unemotional narrator in their ears : WORK WILL MAKE You FREE . <p> She pushed open the gate first , but then stood uncertainly at what she was facing : an opened doorway into total dark . James went on ahead of her , disappearing for long seconds before he triggered the motion sensor and light flooded the room . Then she followed . <p> They were confused , both turning to the left to look at the displays while the voice was describing things unrelated . It took them a while to understand the whole room was about one family 's fate in Lithuania . A large Jewish family rounded up in the town of Kovno by invading Nazis , marched into the barbed-wire ghetto seen in the photographs on the wall , crammed into the room and outhouse depicted in constructions at the end of the room . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kovno ghetto , she was staring at an eight-by-ten photograph of Nazi police shooting the fallen , bloated bodies of Jews on a street while bystanders watched . The bodies were bloated , said the typed caption , because water had been forced in their mouths and " other orifices " with firehoses . It was an authentic photograph . The swollen bodies were clearly discernible , as were individual faces in the curious crowd watching the shootings . Some were smiling . <p> She pointed to the " stop " button , took off her earphones . <p> " He 's not talking about what we 're looking at . " <p> He shook his head . <p> " James , what are these pictures ? " <p> She walked on past the unbearable to the other images on the wall-the ghetto entrance , people lined up to be checked in and out ; the last picture was an oddly pleasant photo of two smiling men and a young boy and a motorcycle . <p> " We made a wrong turn , " he said , pushing his earphones off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He has n't gotten to these pictures yet . . . " <p> " Uh-uh . . . He 's talking about a ' tableau ' - rooms where his family lived- " <p> " Over there , built into the corner . Are you rewinding ? " <p> " Hmm . " he punched more buttons . " Ca n't get it to the beginning of this room . " <p> She tried , too , winding too far back , too far ahead . <p> They stood there in the middle of the room with its handpainted walls depicting the roofs and spires of Kovno , Lithuania , its amateur sets of scenes from the ghetto , its one wall of black-framed photographs captioned in Courier typed on a faded ribbon . <p> " He has a good voice , " she said . " So deep-and is that accent Yiddish ? Mixed with southern ? " <p> " It 's him , " he said . <p> " Who ? " <p> " The man who greeted us-Jonas , was it ? " <p> " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you catch his last name ? " <p> " No , " she said . " I think I 'll give up on timing the tape to this room , just look around . " <p> " OK , " he said , still pushing " rewind " and " forward . " " I 'll cue you when we step back out in the hallway . " <p> She examined the mock-up of a ghetto room , a small table where the tiny plastic bags of bread and beans and rice were labeled as the measured weekly food rations for a large ghetto family . <p> She turned to see James standing by the entrance . he was looking again at the photograph of the killers with their rifles pointed down at the prostrate , water-bloated Jews . She came up behind him , looking over his shoulder . Sneaking a peek , she thought , feeling guilty , as if she were spying on him as he gazed at pornography . She was ashamed she was interested herself , though so sickened by the subject . <p> Then her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right shoulder . It looked slanted , weakened . What was in there ? What evil thing was growing inside ? She turned her face toward the door and took his left arm . <p> They went out to the hallway and returned to their tapes and the guided tour by the man whose name they could n't remember . They were led to the next room , where they learned what happened to the narrator 's family . he had been a seven-year-old boy , one of the children of forced laborers in the ghetto . His mother had been made to load coal cars . One morning the Jews had to line up in the street for " selection " conducted by a Nazi sergeant named Helmut Rauca . Somehow this little museum had dressed out a tall mannequin in the full Nazi uniform that Sergeant Rauca would have been wearing . The model of Rauca loomed with his riding crop as he had over the masses at dawn , as the narrator , a boy pressed between his parents , must have seen him . At rollcall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghetto to a concentration camp " to work . " Sergeant Helmut Rauca , said the narrator , " decided with a flick of a riding crop who would live or die " as he pointed families to the left or right . It soon became clear to the narrator 's father , a lawyer , that families led by professionals , writers , and intellectuals never returned . One morning the father was asked to step forward . Sergeant Rauca asked his profession . The narrator paused . " My father told Rauca he was an auto mechanic . Rauca pointed to the right . We all followed Father to the right , back into the ghetto . " <p> She knew they were at the same place on the tape when she saw James smile at this . Their eyes met . They were hearing it together , the son 's pride in his wily father . <p> The narrator went on to tell of his father 's disastrous attempts at working as a mechanic on a Nazi truck-and of their family 's escape from the ghetto in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon to flee to the Lithuanian countryside . <p> As they left this room , going back into the hallway , they heard sounds ahead of them : a chuffing train , a dog barking . Recordings , sound effects . And yet she thought she heard actual voices as well , high-pitched voices . He , too , looked puzzled , sliding his earphone back . <p> " Are there other people in here ? Ahead of us ? " she asked . <p> " Did n't seem like it . " <p> " We 've been alone in here , " she said . " I know that- " <p> " It does n't feel like there 's anyone else in the building . " <p> " It 's sound effects ? " <p> " Must be , " he said . <p> They entered a chuffing , train-whistling boxcar fashioned from a section of the hallway and then were told to " exit " its side door into the next room . Here the barks of the dog became louder . And in this room was the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of a row of photographs and artifacts , it was a low opening in the wall at the back of the room . <p> The barking stopped . She listened to the narrator tell of the farmer who let them hide under his potato field , of the tunnel his father and uncles dug , the excavation it led to where they would exist underground for almost a year . She looked closely at the pictures of the good Christian farmer who risked his life , of the patch of his flat potato field that covered nine people . She stared a long time at the sepia photograph of a young man ; his dark liquid eyes seemed to look into hers . he was a cousin , who one night had lifted the lid of the hiding place and sneaked across the fields to a village to get food . he had been captured , made to dig his own grave , and shot . <p> When she turned , she saw her lover on his hands and knees at the mouth of the tunnel . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who 'd said you did n't have to go in the tunnel if you chose not to . His name was Latman . <p> The recorded Mr. Latman was telling about what it was like to live in a hole in the earth . She looked around her-a statue of a dog stood on a platform depicting the potato field . In the nights when Mr. Latman 's father had stealthily dug their hiding place , he had befriended the farmer 's dog . When they went underground , the dog had stood faithful guard over them every night . The recorded barking began again . She was alone in the room . She shivered , and felt a sudden panic . <p> There was nothing to do but get down on her knees and crawl into the darkness . <p> She 'd crawled a few feet and felt she was in something round , a big pipe . She could see nothing ahead of her . She wanted to find James . How far ahead was he in the dark ? Her fear seemed to expand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was he thinking now ? she wondered . he did n't want to talk about it . Not yet . She called his name , but there was no reply . She kept going . <p> Suddenly there was noise behind her in the dark . Little children 's voices . Laughing . <p> " Hey , there 's somebody in here ! " squealed a young voice . <p> " Ooh , this is scair-ree , " another child said . Giggles came from further back . <p> " Ben ? Who 's in here ? Is somebody up ahead ? " <p> " Who 's there ? " came a voice almost in her ear . " <p> ME ! " she roared , turning her head like a dog barking backward . <p> She could feel a scampering retreat behind her , heard receding giggles . <p> Her minute of panic dissipated with the children 's laughter . She crawled around a curve to find a barely visible earthen cave , where mannequins depicted the Latman family huddled around a lantern . She paused there , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child curled under a blanket at the feet of the adults . The sound of laughing children still in her ears , she thought , I was five that year , the year these people , that boy , lived in this hole . I was playing hide-and-seek with my brother and sister on warm summer nights . <p> She wanted to get out of this tunnel , stand up , get back to James . <p> She emerged into the main room . It seemed blazing with light . <p> He was there , talking to Jonas Latman . Around the two men danced three beautiful children-two little boys with wide mischievous grins and sparkling eyes and a smaller girl with blonde ringlets . They were darting out of Mr. Latman 's reach as he tried to talk and grab one of them at the same time . <p> She walked toward them , blinking in the brightness . <p> " I 'm sorry to disturb you , " he said as she approached . " They got away from me . I 've told them and told them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tape recording coming from him . Strange , too , to hear its taped neutrality sound so stressed and human . <p> " Here is Mr. Latman , darling . It 's just what we thought-he is the boy-this is his story . " <p> " Children ! Go back to my office . Right now ! " <p> They quieted , but did n't obey . <p> " Grampa ? " said the golden-haired girl , taking his hand with both of hers . " Can we play in the cave ? Pleeeze ? " <p> " Forgive me , " he said , holding up the palm of his free hand , " I 'm babysitting today . " <p> They both smiled at him , murmuring , " No problem . " She mentioned something about knowing how kids . . . <p> " Go ! " he said to the children sternly . But immediately relented : " After the guests have finished with the tour . . . now , scat . Back to my office . Right now . " <p> The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all ran out . Into the " boxcar , " she thought , and out its other end . <p> " Play in the cave ! " scoffed Mr. Latman . " Can you imagine ? It 's a game to them . The place my father saved us ... the way we survived . " <p> " You must be very proud of such a father , " she said . <p> " A great man , yes . And my mother , too , still with us in 2000 . Heroes together to us all . Your husband was just asking about him . I was telling him my father survived to live a long and productive life . he helped plan this museum . he gave the history . " Mr. Latman 's eyes were moist . " He gave the facts . You know what ? On his deathbed he told me how he shored up our hiding place with wood . Walls and a roof . Without any nails . " <p> " And you re-created it , " James said , " the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she finished . " You let us see it . " <p> " Lots of help , lots of help , " he shrugged . " But my grandchildren ? Can you believe it ? They use it for games , for hide-and-go-seek . " <p> But she saw that Mr. Latman was smiling , his face illuminated , his eyes now full of mischief like the little boys ' . <p> In the parking lot they walked past the only other car . Above the Civic 's license plate a sticker read VISIT THE VA HOLOCAUST MUSEUM . It was Jonas Latman 's , of course . There had been no other visitors this gray Saturday afternoon . <p> " The odd thing was-did you notice ? " <p> " What ? " she said , suddenly reaching to him , holding his shoulders with both hands . <p> " How he felt ? About the children playing in the tunnel ? His father's- " <p> She pulled him to her . " He seemed happy . he seemed happy with us , too . " <p> " Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
