The Best New Talent of 2005 // Jaime Pressly BREAKOUT TRAILER TREASURE Jaime Pressly 's rsum is something of a black hole . Give it a serious once-over-really , scrutinize it closely-and ... nope , nothing at all . There is n't one thing-not her role as a nymphomaniac in a Jerry Springer movie , or her stint as the " It 's already been broughten ! " girl from Not Another Teen Movie , and certainly not the countless lad-mag spreads that have showcased her ample bosom-that approaches the hilarity of her shameless performance as Joy , the title character 's scheming harridan of an ex-wife on NEC 's My Name Is Earl . * Vainer actresses would never dream of reveling in Joy 's tacky lows ( like that god-awful wedding getup ) , but for Pressly , 28 , taking it to the hillbilly hilt came easily . She just needed to look in her own Kinston , N.C. , backyard . " This girl exists in real life , " she says . " It 's people that I grew up with , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was born and raised in my hometown and never left until the day she died . I throw a lot of her sauciness into this role . " * Other ingredients include Kmart clothes , a wig , and bad eyeliner . " In this business , people do n't look at somebody like me and praise me . They call me a bombshell or a sexpot and they put me on the cover of Maxim . All I wanted was the opportunity to show what I could do . " With this ribald , Emmy-worthy portrayal , Pressly is finally getting that chance . - Nicholas Fonseca Ciara BREAKOUT 1 , 2 STEPPER With Beyonc reporting for Destiny 's Child duty , the 20-year-old emerged as the latest booty-shaking heir to Janet Jackson 's urban-pop throne . Her debut , Goodies , sold 3 million copies on the strength of three irresistible hits , including the full-of-sass title track and the Missy Elliott-aided throwdown " 1 , 2 Step . " Mmm , mmm , goodielicious ! - Raymond Fiore J.R . Moehringer BREAKOUT BARFLY ON THE WALL Moehringer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers alike punch-drunk with love over his alcohol-infused memoir of the role models who frequented his Long Island town 's rollicking pub . From there to Yale , The New York Times , and beyond , Moehringer tells funny , touching stories-the types of tales usually slurred in a drunken revelry and then lost forever . - Gilbert Cruz Wentworth Miller BREAKOUT BREAKOUT There is one thing that Prison Break 's fans and detractors agree upon : " The show is completely preposterous , " laughs Wentworth Miller , star of the Fox drama . " But that aside , it 's a great ride . " We 're thrilled to hear that the 33-year-old Miller has some perspective about his debut series , since it basically rests on his heavily ( fake ) tattooed shoulders . As Michael Scofield-a steely-eyed engineer who gets himself thrown into prison in order to break out his brother-Miller 's job , as he puts it , is to " anchor the implausible . " * Some of you may recognize Miller from the last time he was supposed to break out , in the 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Hopkins was just about the only well-reviewed thing in the film . " It opened a few doors for me , " he says , " but suddenly I was competing for roles with guys who had been on magazine covers . " So Miller turned to TV , inspired in part by Sam Waterston 's " godlike " performance on Law &; Order , and picked up the Prison Break script . " There 's great work being done on every level of the TV business , " he says . " I sank six months into a feature film , which came and went . It 's gratifying to be part of a project that people are investing in over the long haul . " - Whitney Pastorek Amy Adams RED-HOTBREAKOUT After seven years of supporting roles , Adams , as the sweetheart center of the Southern family drama Junebug , was a revelation . Her guileless Ashley , a seemingly naive pregnant wife dazzled by her city-sleek sister-in-law , is sunny and soulful . The critical accolades ( Adams won prizes at Sundance and the Gotham Awards ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't get into acting to have a moment , " the 30-year-old actress shyly demurs . " I got into it because of people who 've inspired me , like Judi Dench , Holly Hunter , and Jodie Foster . The lifers. " * Next up is another supporting role , in Will Ferrell 's untitled NASCAR comedy due in August 2006 , and then a princess turn in 2007 's Disney film Enchanted . But what she 's really wishing for are the " dark and absurd " roles that continue to elude her . " There 's plenty of audition tape out there with me screaming and tearing my hair out , " she says . " Most of the roles I want , everybody 's like , " Oh , you look too young to play this . ' I 'm not ! " Tell her that most actresses do n't advertise their age , and she laughs . " Everything I want to do lies in front of me , so why would I wish for my youth ? This has been such a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be young and confused and firm . " - Karen Valby Fall Out Boy BREAKOUT " BOY " BAND A humble Chicago pop-punk foursome writ large thanks to From Under the Cork Tree , their second album and a Billboard chart staple since May ( the group recently scored a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist ) . The screaming girls at TRL flipped for their smart-ass breakup anthem " Sugar , We 're Goin Down , " but do n't let that deter you-FOB 's spastic power chords , gleeful choruses , and snarkily heartfelt lyrics flow like love letters e-mailed from the Warped Tour bus . If this is emo , sign us up . - WP Elizabeth Kostova BREAKOUT LONG IN THE MAKING When you work on a book for 10 years , chances are it 's going to be pretty huge . And there was no bigger debut this summer-in pages ( 640 ) and buzz-than The Historian , Kostova 's fictional tale of the real-life inspiration for Dracula . Its blend of history and intrigue earned it comparisons to The Da Vinci Code and proved America does want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Williams BREAKOUT TV ACTOR WHO CA N'T DRIVE As a young Chris Rock , the scrawny , saucer-eyed 13-year-old star of UPN 's Everybody Hates Chris endures the traumas of childhood with patient incredulity-even as he 's pelted with insults , rejections , and batteries . ( A remarkable feat given that Williams ' last job involved cavorting with Snuffleupagus . ) Too bad the kids of Bed-Stuy circa 1980 do n't value sharp comic timing : If they did , Williams would be too cool for school . - WP The Game BREAKOUT PLAYER Growling out of the West Coast like a name-dropping rabid dog , this gangsta with attitude put Compton back on the rap map with his trunk-jarring major-label debut , The Documentary . The disc crashed into the charts at No. 1 and went on to spawn three crossover hits . An ugly beef with onetime collaborator 50 Cent grabbed headlines , but it 's the MC 's natural skills on the mic that should help make his quest for longevity much more than a trivial pursuit . - Ryan Dombal <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
