1 MOUSE IS DEAD . Those words had gone through my mind every morning for three months . Mouse is dead because of me . When I sat up , Bonnie rolled her shoulder and sighed in her sleep . The sky through our bedroom window was just beginning to brighten . The image of Raymond , his eyes open and unseeing , lying stockstill on EttaMae 's front lawn , was still in my mind . I lurched out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom . My feet hurt every morning , too , as if I had spent all night walking , searching for EttaMae , to ask her where she 'd taken Ray after carrying him out of the hospital . So he was still alive ? I asked a nurse who had been on duty that evening . No , she said flatly . His pulse was gone . The head nurse had just called the doctor to pronounce him dead when that crazy woman hit Arnold in the head with a suture tray and took Mr. Alexander 's body over her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash to open the drapes . Red sunlight glinted through the ragged palms at the end of our block . I had never wept over Raymond 's demise , but that tattered light reflected a pain deep in my mind . IT TOOK ME over half an hour to get dressed . No two socks matched and every shirt seemed to be the wrong color . While I was tying my shoes Bonnie woke up . " What are you doing , Easy ? " she asked . She had been born in British Guyana but her father was from Martinique , so there was the music of the French language in her English accent . " Gettin ' dressed , " I said . " Where are you going ? " " Where you think I'ma be goin ' at this time'a day ? To work . " I was feeling mean because of that red light in the far-off sky . " But it 's Saturday , baby . " " What ? " Bonnie climbed out of the bed and hugged me . Her naked skin was firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want some breakfast ? " I asked . " Maybe a little later , " she said . " I did n't get in from Idlewild until two this morning . And I have to go back out again today . " " Then you go to bed , " I said . " You sure ? I mean ... did you need to talk ? " " Naw . Nuthin 's wrong . Just stupid is all . Thinkin ' Saturday 's a workday . Damn . " " Are you going to be okay ? " she asked . " Yeah . Sure I am . " Bonnie had a fine figure . And she was not ashamed to be seen naked . Looking at her pulling on those covers reminded me of why I fell for her . If I had n't been so sad , I would have followed her back under those blankets . FEATHER 'S LITTLE YELLOW DOG , Frenchie , was hiding somewhere , snarling at me while I made sausages and eggs . He was the love of my little girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for the death of Idabell Turner , his first owner ; I blamed myself for the death of my best friend . I WAS SITTING at breakfast , smoking a Chesterfield and wondering if EttaMae had moved back down to Houston . I still had friends down there in the Fifth Ward . Maybe if I wrote to Lenora Circel and just dropped a line about Etta say hi to Etta for me or give Etta my love . Then when she wrote back I might learn something . " Hi , Dad . " My hand twitched , flicking two inches of cigarette ash on the eggs . Jesus was standing there in front of me . " I told you not to sneak up on me like that , boy . " " I said hi , " he explained . The eggs were ruined but I was n't hungry . And I could n't stay mad at Jesus , anyway . I might have taken him in when he was a child , but the truth was that he had adopted me . Jesus worked hard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was stronger than blood . " What you doin ' today ? " I asked him . " Nuthin ' . Messin ' around . " " Sit down , " I said . Jesus did n't move the chair as he sat , because there was enough room for him to slide in under the table . He never wasted a movement or a word . " I wan na drop out of high school , " he said . " Say what ? " His dark eyes stared into mine . He had the smooth , eggshellbrown skin and the straight black hair of people who had lived in the Southwest for thousands of years . " It 's only a year and a half till you graduate , " I said . " A diploma will help you get a job . And if you keep up with track , you could get a scholarship to UCLA . " He looked down at my hands . " Why ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " he said . " I just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be there all the time . " " You think I like goin ' to work ? " " You like it enough , " he said . " ' Cause if you did n't like it , you 'd quit . " I could see that he 'd made up his mind , that he 'd thought about this decision for a long time . He probably had the papers for me to sign under his bed . I was about to tell him no , that he 'd have to stick out the year at least . But then the phone rang . It was a loud ringer , especially at sixthirty in the morning . While I limped to the counter Jesus left on silent bare feet . " Hello ? " " Easy ? " It was a man 's voice . " John ? Is that you ? " " I 'm in trouble and I need you to do me a favor , " John said all in a rush . He 'd been practicing just like Jesus . My heart quickened . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen cabinet . I do n't know if it was an old friend 's voice or the worry in his tone that got to me . But all of a sudden I was n't miserable or sad . " What you need , John ? " " Why'ont you come over to the lots , Easy ? I wan na look you in the eye when I tell ya what we want . " " Oh , " I said , thinking about we and the fact that whatever John had to say was too serious to be discussed over the phone . " Sure . As soon as I can make it . " I hung up with a giddy feeling running around my gut . I could feel the grin on my lips . " Who was that ? " Bonnie asked . She was standing at the door to our bedroom , half wrapped in a terry-cloth robe . She was more beautiful than any man could possibly deserve . " John . " " The bartender ? " " Do you have to leave today ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have a whole week off . " " I ca n't wait that long , " I said . I gathered her up in my arms and carried her back into the bedroom . " Easy , what are you doing ? " I tossed her on the bed and then closed the door to the kitchen . I took off my pants and stood over her . " Easy , what 's got into you ? " The look on my face was answer enough for any arguments she might have had about the children or her need for sleep . I could n't have explained my sudden passion . All I knew was the smell of that woman , her taste and texture on my skin and tongue , was something I had never known before in my life . It was as if I discovered sex for the first time that morning .
