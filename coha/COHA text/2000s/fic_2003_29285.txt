MORTAL PREY By John Sandford G. P. PUTNAM 'S SONS THE THOUGHT POPPED INTO HER HEAD as she lay in the soft-washed yellowed sheets in the hospital bed . The thought popped in between the gas pains and muscle spasms , through the pungent odor of alcohol swabs , and if she 'd read the thought in a book , she might have smiled at it . She was n't smiling at anything now . She stared past the IV drip bag at the whitewashed plaster ceiling and tried not to groan when the pains came , knowing that they would end ; tried not to look at the hard-eyed Mexicano at the end of the bed , his hand never far from the pistol that lay under the newspaper on the arm of his chair . Tried not to think about Paulo . Tried not to think about anything , but sometimes the thoughts popped up : tall , wiry Paulo in his ruffled tuxedo shirt , his jacket on the chair , a glass of red wine in one hand , his other hand , balled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the full-length mirror on the back of his bedroom door , pretending to be a matador . Paulo with the children 's book Father Christmas , sitting naked at her kitchen table with a glass of milk and a milk mustache , delighted by the grumpy Santa Claus . Paulo asleep next to her , his face pale and trusting in the day 's first light , the soft light that came in over the gulf just before sunrise . But the thought that might have made her smile , if it was in a book , was : Just like the fuckin ' Godfather . LIKE THIS : AN Italian restaurant called Gino 's , with the full Italian-clich stage settingsienna orange wails , bottles of Chianti with straw wrappers , red-and-white checked tablecloths , baskets of hot crusty bread as soon as you sat down , the room smelling of sugar and wheat , olives and peppers , and black oily coffee . A few rickety tables outside faced the Plaza de Arboles and the fifties tourist-coordinated stucco church across the way , San Fernando de Something-or-Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , slow bell version of the Singing Nun 's " Dominique , " more or less at noon , depending on whose turn it was to drop the needle on the aging vinyl bell-record . Paulo took her to lunch almost every day , picking her up at the hotel where she worked as a bookkeeper . They 'd eat Mexican one day , California or French the next , Italian twice a week . He picked her up about noon , so on most days she could hear , near or far , the recorded bells of San Fernando 's . Gino 's was the favored spot . Despite the clichd Italian stage-setting , there was an actual Gino cooking at Gino 's , and the food was terrific . Paulo would pick her up in a black BMW 740iL , his business car , with his smooth-faced business driver . They 'd hook up with friends , eat a long Caribbean lunch and laugh and argue and talk politics and cars and boats and sex , and at two o'clock or so , they 'd all head back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , but predictable enough . ISRAEL COEN SAT up in the choir loft at the back of the church with his rifle , a scoped Remington Model 700 in .30-06 . He 'd sighted it in along a dirt track west of town , zeroed at exactly sixty yards , the distance he 'd be shooting across the Plaza de Arboles . There was no problem making the shot . If all you wanted was that Izzy Coen make a sixty-yard shot with a scoped Remington 700 , you could specify which shirt button you wanted the slug to punch through . Not that everything was perfect . The moron who 'd bought the gun apparently thought that bigger was better , so Izzy would be shooting at sixty yards through an eight-power scope , and about all he could see was a shirt button . He would have preferred no magnification at all , or an adjustable two- to six-power scope , to give him a little room around the crosshairs . But he did n't have that , and would have to make do . The problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only was the temperature somewhere in the 120s , he thought , but the humidity must have been 95 percent . He 'd sweated through his shirt at his armpits and across his chest , and the sweat beaded on his cheeks and forehead and arms . When he put the rifle to his cheek , the scope fogged over in a matter of seconds . He had a bottle of springwater with him , and that helped keep his body cool enough to function , but there was nothing he could do about the fogging eyepiece . The shot would have to be a quick one . No matter . He 'd scouted the play for three days , he knew what the conditions would be , and he was ready , up high with a rifle , yellow vinyl kitchen gloves protecting against the inadvertent fingerprint , the jeans and thin long-sleeved shirt meant to guard against DNA traces . Izzy was good . He 'd been in the loft for an hour and ten minutes when he saw the 740iL ease around the corner . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Izzy believed in redundancy . He picked up the first walkie-talkie , pushed the transmit button , and asked , " Hear me ? " " Yes . " " Come now . " " One minute . " TEN OF THEM had been sitting in the back of Gino 's , the talk running down , a friend leaving and then another , with his new girlfriend , who 'd been brought around for approval . Then Paulo looked at his watch and said to Rinker , " We better get back . " " Just a minute , " she said . " Turn this way . " She turned his chin in her hand , dipped a napkin into a glass of water , and used the wet cloth to wipe a nearly invisible smear of red sauce from his lower lip . " I was saving that for later , " he protested . " I could n't send you back that way , " she said . " Your mother would kill me . " " My mother , " he said , rolling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the fuckin ' Godfatherand the black BMW stopped beyond the balustrade that separated the restaurant 's patio from the Plaza . They walked past an American who sat at a circular table in his Hawaiian shirt and wide-brimmed flat hat , peering into a guidebookall the details as clear and sharp three days later , in the hospital , as the moment when it happenedand the driver started to get out and Paulo called , " I got it , I got it , " and Rinker reached for the door handle , but Paulo beat her to it , stepping in front of her in that last little quarter-second of life .... The shot sounded like a firecracker , but the driver knew it was n't . The driver was in his pocket as Rinker , suddenly feeling illnot in pain , yet , but just ill , and for some inexplicable reason , failingwent to the ground , Paulo on top of her . She did n't understand , even as a roaring , ripping sound enveloped her , and she rolled and Paulo looked down at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened his mouth and his blood gushed onto her face and into her mouth . She began screaming as the roaring sound resumed . She rolled and pushed Paulo down on the cobbles and turned his head to keep him from drowning in his own blood , and began screaming at the driver , " Paulo , Paulo , Paulo ... " The driver looked at her , everything slow-moving . She saw the boxy black-steel weapon in his hand , a gun like she had n't seen before . She saw his mouth open as he shouted something , then he looked back over the car and then back down at Paulo . Then he was standing over them , and he lifted Paulo and put him on the backseat , and lifted her , and put her in the passenger seat , and in seconds they were flying across the Plaza , the hospital three minutes away , no more . She looked over the seat , into Paulo 's open eyes ; but Paulo was n't there anymore . Paulo had gone . She could taste his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Paulo had left the building . IZZY COHEN SAID , " Goddamnit , " and he was n't sure it 'd gone right . The scope had blocked too much and he ran the bolt and lifted the rifle for a second shot , the bodies right there , and he saw the driver doing something , and then as Izzy lifted the rifle , the driver opened up and the front of the church powdered around him and Izzy thought , Jeez ... An Uzi , he thought , or a gun just like it . Izzy rolled away from the window as the glass blew inward , picked up the two walkie-talkies , and scrambled to the far corner of the loft and the steel spiral stair , the bullets flying around him like bees . He dove down the stair and punched through the back door , where a yellow Volkswagen Beetle was waiting with its engine running . Izzy threw the gun in the back , climbed in , and slammed the door . The driver accelerated away from the church 's back door and shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Fuck if I know , " Izzy said . He was pulling off the latex gloves , shaking glass out of his hair . Blood on his handhe dabbed at his cheek : just a nick . " A fuckin ' Uzi , maybe . " " Uzi ? What is this Uzi ? " " Israeli gun , it 's a machine gun ... " " I know what is a fuckin ' Uzi , " the driver shouted . " WHY is this fuckin ' Uzi ? Why is this ? " " I do n't know , " Izzy said . " Just get us back to the plane and maybe we can find out . " THE AIRSTRIP WAS a one-lane dirt path cut out of apiece of scraggly jungle twenty kilometers west of the city . On the way , the driver got on his cell phone and made a call , shouting in Spanish over the pounding of the Volkswagen . " Find out anything ? " Izzy asked when he rang off . " I call now , maybe find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little man who wore a plain pink short-sleeved dress shirt with khaki slacks and brown sandals . His English was usually excellent , but deteriorated under stress . A couple of kilometers east of the airstrip , they stopped and the driver led the way through a copse of trees to a water-filled hole in the ground . Izzy wiped the Remington and threw it in the hole and tossed the box of shells in after it . " Hope it does n't dry up , " he said , looking at the ripples on the black water . The driver shook his head . " There 's no bottom , " he said . " The hole goes all the way to hell . " The phone rang on the way back to the car and the driver answered it , spoke for a minute , and then clicked off with a nervous sideways glance at Izzy . " What ? " " Two dead , " the driver said . " One bullet ? " " One shot , " Izzy said with satisfaction . " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe . Nobody knows . " THE AIRSTRIP TERMINAL was a tin-roofed , concrete block building , surrounded by ragged palmettos , with an incongruous rooster-shaped weather vane perched on top . What might have been a more professional windsock hung limply from a pole beside the building , except that the windsock was shaped like a six-foot-long orange trout , and carried the legend " West Yellowstone , Montana . " A Honda generator chugged away in a locked steel box behind the building , putting out the thin stink of burnt gasoline . Finger-sized lizards climbed over walls , poles , and tree trunks , searching for bugs , of which there were many ' . Everything about the place looked as tired as the windsock . Even the trees . Even the lizards . From the trip in , Izzy knew the generator ran an ancient air conditioner and an even older dusty-red Coca-Cola cooler inside the building , where the owner sat with a stack of Playboy magazines , a radio , and a can of Raid for the biting flies . " I 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plane . " When Izzy had gone inside , the driver , now sweating as heavily as the American , dug a revolver out from under the front seat of the Volkswagen , swung the cylinder out and checked it , closed the cylinder , and put the gun under his belt at the small of his back . Izzy and the driver had known each other for a few years , and there existed the possibility that the driver 's name was on a list somewhere ; that somebody knew who was driving Israel Coen around Cancn . But the driver doubted it . Nobody would want to know the details of a thing like this , and Izzy would n't want anyone to know . Only two people had seen the driver 's face and Izzy 's in the same place : Izzy himself , and the airport manager . The driver walked into the airport building and pulled the door shut . The building had four windows , and they all looked the same way ' , out at the strip . And it was cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sat with a Coca-Cola at a metal desk , directly in front of the air conditioner . " Is he coming ? the driver asked . " He 's twenty minutes out , " Izzy said , and the airport manager nodded . The driver yawned . He had twenty minutes . Not much time . " Nice trip , " he said to Izzy . He tipped his head at the door , as though he wanted to speak privately . " Hope your business went well . " " Let me get my bag , " Izzy said . He stepped toward the door , and the driver pulled it open with his left hand and held it . Izzy stepped out , the driver right behind him , his right hand swinging up with the revolver . When it was an inch behind Izzy 's head , he pulled the trigger and Izzy 's face exploded in blood and he went down . The driver looked at the body for a moment , not quite believing what he 'd done , then stepped back inside . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked , and the driver shook his head at him . " Too bad , " he said , with real regret . " We 've known each other for a long time , " the airport manager said . " I 'm sorry . " " Why is ... Let me say a prayer . " " No time , " the driver said . " Today we killed Raul Mejia 's baby boy . " He shot the airport manager in the heart , and again in the head to make sure . Back outside , he shot Izzy twice more , the shots sounding distant in his own ears , as if they 'd come from over a hill . He dragged the body inside the airport building and dumped it beside the airport manager 's . He took Izzy 's wallet and all of his cash , a gold ring with a big red stone and the inscription " University of Connecticut , 1986 , " and every scrap of paper he could find on him . He also found the padlock for the door on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box in the manager 's pocket . He went outside , padlocked the door behind himself , killed the generator . There was a black patch of bloody dirt where Izzy 's head had landed . He scuffed more dirt over it , got back in his Volkswagen , and pulled away . Raul Mejia 's baby boy . The driver would have said a prayer for himself , if he could have remembered any . RINKER DID N'T KNOW the names of the players . When she woke up , she was in the hospital 's critical care unit , three empty ' beds with monitoring equipment , and her own bed . Anthony and Dominic , Paulo 's brothers , were sitting at the foot of the bed . She could n't quite make out their faces until Anthony stood up and stepped close . Her mouth was as dry as a saltine cracker : " Paulo ? " Anthony shook his head . Rinker turned her face away , opened her mouth to cry , but nothing came out . Tears began running down her face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead when they got here .... We , uh , you have been in surgery . We need to know , did you see the man who shot you ? " Rinker wagged her head weakly . " I did n't see anything . I just fell down , I did n't know I was shot . Paulo fell on top of me , I tried to turn his head , he was bleeding ... " More tears , and Dominic was turning his straw hat in his hands , pulling the brim through his fingers in a circular motion , like a man measuring yards of cloth . " We are trying to find out who did thisthe police are helping , " Anthony said . " We , uh ... You will be all right . The bullet went through Paulo and fell apart , and the core went into you , in your stomach . They operated for two hours , and you will be all right . " She nodded , but her hand twitched toward her stomach . " I think I 'm , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at Anthony and then Dominic , who had stepped up beside his brother . Dominic now shook his head . " You have lost the baby . " " Oh , God . " Dominic reached out and touched her covered leg . He was tough as a ball bearing , but he had tears rolling down his cheeks . He said , " We 'll find them . This wo n't pass . " She turned her head away and drifted . When she came back , they 'd gone . ( Continues ... )
