In the middle of the night I do n't know who he is , this man lying next to me , his leg brushing against my leg , arm draped over my hip . And that 's when I want him . I keep my eyes closed and turn toward him , stroking him softly , fingers skimming over his chest , his thighs , feathery touches light enough to wake up just the parts that matter . He responds , and we both know what to do , how not to talk , not even to whisper , letting our bodies move together in the dark . This is a man I picked up in a bar ; this is a man whose name I do n't know ; this is searing , anonymous sex with a stranger , and I 'm using all of my senses and none of my heart . He rolls on top of me , heavy and hard , not kissing , hot hands all over me . I grab a condom from my night table and hand it to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dream , breaking the rules of 2:00 a.m. sex . " Please ? " " No , " I say , my eyes still closed , arching toward him now in spite of myself . " Shhh . " I know what he wants , and I 'm not prepared to give it to him . " Baby , " he breathes , and I open my eyes to the face of my husband hovering over mine , earnest and needy , the man I have known since college , the man I share a bathroom with , the man who cried during Little Women , who thinks I do n't know that he plucks his nose hairs , who 's afraid of raisins because they remind him of mouse droppings . " Baby , " he whispers again , and I sigh , fully here now , fullyawake and resigned to it . And this is how we finish , knowing everything about each other , completely together , naked and silent and half-satisfied in the middle of the night .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
