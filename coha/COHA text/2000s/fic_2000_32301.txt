Chapter 1The Call Chapter 1 Sierra Clanton Madrid could n't stop shaking . Her stomach was quivering . Her head had begun throbbing with a tension headache the moment Alex had told her the news . She had n't had a headache like this since prom night during her senior year of high school . Alex had come to pick her up in his father 's beat-up Chevy three minutes before her father turned into the driveway . It was the first time in her life her father had come home early from work . She might have known it would be on that night . She could still remember the look on her father 's face when he saw Alexa drop-dead handsome , long-haired Hispanic boy dressed in a rented tuxedostanding on the wide porch of her family 's Mathesen Street Victorian . As if that was n't bad enough , Alex was reaching forward to pin an orchid to the front of her fancy prom dress . When Sierra heard the slam of her father 's car door , she almost fainted in fear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiring look on Alex 's face . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . What could she say ? She had told her father about Alex ; she just had n't told him everything . Words were exchanged , but , fortunately , her mother was there to intercede and calm her father down . In the end , Alex escorted her to his borrowed car and helped her in while her father stood on the front steps glaring at him . Alex did n't so much as look at her as he put the Chevy in gear and pulled away from the curb . They were halfway to Santa Rosa before he said anything . " You did n't tell him who was taking you to the prom , did you ? " " Yes , I did . " " Yeah , right . You just left out a few important details , did n't you , chiquita ? " He had never called her that before , and it boded ill tidings for the night ahead . He did n't say anything more on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered something cheap , which made him even madder . " You think I ca n't afford to buy you anything more than a dinner salad ? " Her face aflame , she ordered the same prime rib dinner he did , but he did n't look any happier . Things got worse as the evening wore on . By ten , Alex was n't speaking at all , not to her , not to anyone . She ended up losing the nice dinner he bought her in the bathroom of the Villa de Chanticlair . She 'd been crazy in love with Alejandro Luis Madrid . Crazy being the operative word . Her father had warned her . She should have listened . Sierra 's eyes smarted with tears now as she drove along the Old Redwood Highway , which linked Windsor with Healdsburg . For all of its turmoil , she preferred clinging to the now-romantic past rather than facing the uncertain , terrifying present and future . Prom night had been such a disaster . When most of her friends were going to all-night parties in Santa Rosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front lights were turned on , and not discreetly . Her father had probably changed the 60-watt bulb to a 250 while she was gone . Even the inside lights were on that night . There was plenty of light for her to see how angry Alex was . But his expression revealed something deeper than just anger . She could feel the hurt that lay hidden behind the cold , remote expression on his face . She thought he 'd just walk away then . Unfortunately , he did n't intend to do so before he had his say . " I knew it was a mistake to ever ask you out . " The words struck like a shotgun blast to her heart . He was n't finished . " I 'm not some character in a Shakespearean tragedy , Sierra . I 'm not Romeo to your Juliet . And I did n't ask you out because I wanted to play around ! " He turned away with that and almost reached the steps before she could speak past the tears choking her . " I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " What 'd you say ? " His eyes were dark and hot , still mad at herwith good cause . She had n't considered what her silence would cost him . All she had thought about was avoiding a confrontation with her father . Alex stood waiting . " II said I love you . " " Say it in Spanish , " he told her in the same tone he had used when tutoring her . She swallowed , wondering if he only meant to humiliate her more before he walked out of her life . " Te amo , Alejandro Luis Madrid . Corazon y alma . " She started to cry then , hard wracking sobs . He caught hold of her and poured out his feelings in Spanish . Though she did n't fully understand the words , she saw in his eyes and felt in his touch that he loved her . Infrequently over the years , he had fallen back into his first language during times of powerful emotions . He had spoken Spanish when he made love to her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pregnant . He had wept and spoken Spanish in the wee hours of the morning when Clanton had pushed his way into the world , and again when Carolyn was born . And he had spoken Spanish in tears on the night her father died . But that night on the porch , they both forgot about the lights . In fact , they both forgot everything until the front door was jerked open and her father ordered him gone . She was forbidden to see Alex . At the time , it did n't matter to her father that Alex was ranked number four in a class of two hundred students . What mattered was that Luis Madrid , Alex 's father , was " one of those beaners " who worked as a laborer in the Sonoma County vineyards . Her father did n't care that Alex was working a forty-hour week at a local gas station to save money to put himself through college . " I wish him luck , " he said , and it was clear luck was the last thing he wished Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She appealed to her mother , who promptly refused to take her side . In desperation , she threatened to run away or commit suicide . She had gotten their attention with that . " You so much as talk to that beaner on the phone and I 'll call the police ! " her father had yelled . " You 're fifteen . He 's eighteen . I could have him arrested ! " " You do and I 'll tell the police you 're abusing me ! " Her father called her aunt in Merced and made arrangements for her to spend a few weeks there " cooling off . " Alex was waiting when she returned , but he proved less malleable than her male parent . He had a few succinct Spanish words to say about her idea of meeting him in secret . Alex was a fighter who preferred facing wrath head on . She had never expected that he would deal with the situation on his own . He just showed up at the house one day five minutes after her father had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Alex had been waiting down the street for more than an hour . Her mother , sympathetic to their plight , invited Alex into the foyer before her father got to the porch and could order him off the property . Clutching the steering wheel of her Honda Accord , Sierra remembered how she had felt that day , seeing Alex standing in the front hallway between her mother and father . She had been so sure her father would kill him or at least beat him to within an inch of his life . " What 's he doing here ? " She could still hear the anger in her father 's voice as he dumped his briefcase on the floor . Sierra had been convinced he was only freeing his hands so he could get them around Alex 's neck . Alex stepped around her mother and faced him . " I came to ask permission to see your daughter . " " Permission ! Like you asked permission to take her to the prom ? " " I thought Sierra cleared it with you . My mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big mistake . Now get out of here ! " " Brian , give the young man the chance to " " Stay out of this , Marianna ! " Alex stood his ground . " All I ask is a fair hearing . " He did n't even notice her standing above them on the stairs . " I do n't want to hear anything you have to say . " They were like two dogs with their hackles up . " Daddy , please ... , " she said , coming down the stairs . " We love each other . " " Love . I doubt that 's what he feels for you . " " You do n't understand ! " she wailed . " I understand plenty ! Get back to your room ! " " I 'm not going anywhere but with Alex , " she said , reaching the hallway and taking a position beside her boyfriend , and she knew in that instant that if her father came at him , she 'd do whatever she had to do to stop him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on her wrist and firmly pulled her behind him . " This is between your father and me . Stay out of it . " The whole time he spoke , he never took his eyes off her father . " Get out of my house . " " All I want is a few minutes to speak to you , Mr. Clanton . If you tell me afterward to back off , I 'll back off . " " All the way to Mexico ? " " Brian ! " As soon as her father uttered the words , his face turned beet red . Alex , with his own prejudices , had no intention of letting him off easily . " I was born in Healdsburg , Mr. Clanton . Just like you . My father took his citizenship test ten years ago . Not that it makes much difference . He passed with flying colors . Red , white , and blue . He 's never taken a dollar of welfare in his life , and he works hard for what he makes , probably harder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown . We do n't live in a Victorian , " he said with a swift , telling look around , " but we do n't live in a shack either . " His little speech had n't made anything better . " You finished ? " her father said , embarrassment burned away by anger . " You might enjoy knowing that my father and mother disapprove of Sierra as much as you disapprove of me . " Her mouth fell open . " Disapprove of Sierra ? " her father said , insulted . " Why ? " " Why do you think , Mr. Clanton ? She 's white and she 's Protestant . " " Maybe you ought to listen . " " I do listen . I 've got a lot of respect for my parents , but I 've got a mind of my own . The way I see it , a bigot is a bigot , no matter what color he is . " A long , hot silence filled the foyer . " So , " Alex said bleakly . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her for a moment and then back at Alex with resentful resignation . " We talk . " He jerked his head toward a room off the hallway . " But I doubt you 're going to like what I have to say . " They spent the next two hours in the small office at the front of the house while she sat in the kitchen with her mother , alternately crying and raging about what she 'd do if her father would n't let her go out with Alex . Her mother had n't said much of anything that day . When her father came into the kitchen , he told her Alex was gone . Before she had time to scream recriminations , he informed her she could see him again , after she 'd agreed to follow the rules the two of them had established . One phone conversation a night , no longer than thirty minutes and only after her schoolwork was finished . No dates Monday through Thursday . Friday night she was to be home by eleven . Saturday night by ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested for church on Sunday . If her grades dropped a smidgen , she was grounded from Alex completely . If she missed church , same consequences . " And Alex agreed ? " " He agreed . " She had n't liked any of it , but she had been so much in love she would have agreed to anything , and her father knew it . " That boy 's going to break your heart , Sierra . " Now , fourteen years later , he was doing just that . Wiping tears from her eyes , Sierra drove across the Russian River bridge and turned right . She knew her father had hoped things would cool off if he gave the relationship time to develop cracks . He had n't known Alex then , nor did he see the determination and drive that burned in him . Alex graduated with honors from high school and entered the local junior college . Sierra had wanted to quit school and marry him , thinking it would be romantic to work and help put him through college . He squashed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intended to finish college on his own , and he sure did n't want a dropout for a wife . He completed two years of work at Santa Rosa Junior College in a year and a half and transferred to the University of California , Berkeley , where he majored in business , with an emphasis in computer technology . She finished high school and entered a local business college , counting the days to his graduation . As soon as Alex returned to Healdsburg , he found a job with Hewlett-Packard in Santa Rosa , bought a used car , and rented a small bungalow in Windsor . When they could n't get their parents to agree on the kind of wedding they should have , they eloped to Reno . Nobody was very happy about it . They had been married ten years . Ten wonderful years . All that time she 'd thought Alex was as happy as she was . She never suspected what was going on beneath the surface . Why had n't she realized ? Why had n't he told her straight out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway of the Mathesen Street Victorian and prayed her mother was home . Mom had always been able to reason with Daddy . Maybe she could help Sierra figure out how to reason Alex out of his plans for their future . Unlocking the front door , Sierra entered the polished wood foyer . " Mom ? " She closed the door behind her and walked back along the corridor toward the kitchen . She almost called for her father before she caught herself . With a sharp pang , she remembered the call she and Alex had received at three in the morning two years ago . She had never heard her mother 's voice sound that way before . Or since . " Your father 's had a heart attack , honey . The ambulance is here . " They had met her at the Healdsburg General Hospital , but it was already too late . " He complained of indigestion this morning , " her mother had said , distracted , in shock . " And his shoulder was aching . " Now , Sierra paused at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sitting at his desk reading the real estate section of the newspaper . She still missed him . Oddly , so did Alex . He and her father had become close after Clanton and Carolyn were bornamazing the way grandchildren seemed to break down walls between people . Prior to her pregnancy , she and Alex had seen little of her parents . Her father always found some excuse to turn down dinner invitations ; Alex 's parents were no better . All that changed when she went into labor . Everyone was at Kaiser Hospital the night she gave birth . Alex had kissed her and said maybe they should name their son Makepeace . They had settled on Clanton Luis Madrid , forging both families together . By the time Carolyn Maria arrived a year later , the Clantons and the Madrids had had plenty of opportunity to get to know one another and find out they had a lot more in common than they ever thought possible . " Mom ? " Sierra called again , not finding her in the kitchen . She looked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was n't there either . The Buick Regal was in the driveway , so she knew her mother was n't off on one of her many charity projects or at the church . Sierra went back along the corridor and up the stairs . " Mom ? " Maybe she was taking a nap . She peered into the master bedroom . A bright granny-square afghan was folded neatly on the end of the bed . " Mom ? " " I 'm in the attic , honey . Come on up . " Surprised , Sierra went down the hallway and climbed the narrow stairway . " What are you doing up here ? " she said , entering the cluttered attic . The small dormer windows were open , allowing a faint sun-warmed breeze into the dusty , dimly lit room . Dust particles danced on the beam of sunlight . The place smelled musty with age and disuse . The attic had always fascinated Sierra , and she momentarily put aside her worries as she looked around . Lawn chairs were stacked at the back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with old umbrellas , two canes , and a crooked walking stick . Wicker baskets in a dozen shapes and sizes sat on a high shelf . Boxes were stacked in odd piles , in no particular order , their contents a mystery . How many times had she and her brother gone through their rooms , sorting and boxing and shoving discards into the attic ? When Grandma and Grandpa Clanton had died , boxes from their estate had taken up residence in the quiet dimness . Old books , trunks , and boxes of dishes and silverware were scattered about . A hat tree stood in a back corner on an old braided rag rug that had been made by Sierra 's great-grandmother . The box of old dress-up clothes she had donned as a child was still there . As was the large oval mirror where she had admired herself with each change . Nearby , stacked in her brother 's red Radio Flyer wagon , were a dozen or more framed pictures leaning one upon another against the wall . Some were original oils done by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dated back several generations . Paint cans left over from restoration on the house were stacked on a shelf in case touch-ups were needed to the colorful trim . One bookshelf was filled with shoe boxes , each labeled in her father 's neat printing and holding tax returns and business records going back twenty years . A tattered , paint-chipped rocking horse stood in lonely exile in the far back corner . Her mother had moved some of the old furniture around so that Grandpa Edgeworth 's old couch with the lion-claw legs was sitting in the center of the attic . Opposite it was Daddy 's old worn recliner . Two ratty needlepoint footstools served as stands for the things her mother had removed from an old trunk that stood open before her . Marianna Clanton had a tea towel wrapped around her hair . " I thought I should go through some of these things and make some decisions . " " Decisions about what ? " Sierra said , distracted . " What to throw away , what to keep . " " Why now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother said with a rueful smile . " I just kept putting it off . " She looked around at the cluttered room . " It 's a little overwhelming . Bits and pieces from so many lives . " Sierra ran her hand over an old stool that had been in the kitchenette before it was remodeled . She remembered coming home from kindergarten and climbing up on it at the breakfast bar so she could watch her mother make Tollhouse cookies . " Alex called me a little while ago and told me he 's accepted a job in Los Angeles . " Her mother glanced up at her , a pained expression flickering across her face . " It was to be expected , I suppose . " " Expected ? How ? " " Alex has always been ambitious . " " He has a good job . He got that big promotion last year , and he 's making good money . They gave him a comprehensive health package and retirement plan . We have a wonderful new house . We like our neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to family . I did n't even know Alex had put out word he was looking for another position until he called me today " Her voice broke . " He was so excited , Mom . You should 've heard him . He said this new company made him a fantastic offer and he accepted it without even talking to me about it . " " What sort of company ? " " Computers . Games . The sort of stuff Alex likes to play around with at home . He met these guys at a sales conference last spring in Las Vegas . He never even told me about them . He says he did , but I do n't remember . Alex has been working on an idea he has for a role-playing game for an Internet-type program . Players could link up with others and create armies and battle scenarios . He said it 's right up their alley . And it does n't even bother him that they have n't been in business four years yet , or that they started business in a garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's different . These guys have n't been around long enough to prove they can stay in business . I do n't see how Alex can throw away ten years ' seniority at Hewlett-Packard when people are being laid off of other jobs left and right ! I do n't want to go to Los Angeles , Mom . Everything I love is here . " " You love Alex , honey . " " I 'd like to shoot Alex ! Where does he get off making a decision like this without even discussing it with me ? " " Would you have listened if he had ? " She could n't believe her mother would ask such a thing . " Of course I 'd listen ! Does n't he think it has anything to do with me ? " She wiped angry tears from her cheeks . " You know what he said to me , Mom ? He told me he 'd already called a Realtor , and the woman 's coming by tonight to list the house . Can you believe it ? I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has his way , I wo n't even be here to see them bloom ! " Her mother said nothing for a long moment . She folded her hands in her lap while Sierra rummaged through her shoulder bag for a Kleenex . Sierra sniffled into the tissue . " It 's not fair . He never even took my feelings into consideration , Mom . He just made the decision and told me it 's a done deal . Just like that . Whether I like it or not , we 're moving to Los Angeles . He does n't even care how I feel about it because it 's what he wants . " " I 'm sure Alex did n't make the decision arbitrarily . He 's always looked at everything from all sides . " " Not from my side . " Restless and upset , she walked across the room and picked up an old stuffed bear her brother had cuddled when he was a boy . She hugged it against her . " Alex grew up here just like I did , Mom . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything and be so happy about it . " " Maybe Alex was n't treated as kindly as you were , Sierra . " Sierra glanced back at her mother in surprise . " His parents never abused him . " " I was n't referring to Luis or Maria ; they 're wonderful people . I mean the assumptions too many people make about Hispanics . " " Well , he can add all that to the other things Los Angeles will have to offer . Smog . Traffic . Riots . Earthquakes . " Her mother smiled . " Disneyland . Movie stars . Beaches , " she recited , clearly seeing a much more positive side to things . Daddy used to call it her Pollyanna attitude , especially when he was irritated and in no mood to see the good side of a situation . The way Sierra was feeling now . " Everyone we love is here , Mom . Family , friends . " " You 're not moving to Maine , honey . It 's only a day 's drive between Healdsburg and Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You talk as though it does n't matter to you that we 're leaving . " Sierra bit her lip and looked away . " I thought you 'd understand . " " If I could make the choice , of course , I 'd rather you were here . And I do understand . Your grandparents were far from overjoyed when I moved from Fresno to San Francisco . " She smiled . " It was a ten-hour drive in those days , but you 'd have thought I 'd moved to the far side of the moon . " Sierra smiled wanly . " It 's hard for me to see you as some sort of beatnik living in San Francisco , Mom . " She laughed . " No less hard than it is for me to see you as a young woman with a wonderful husband and two children in school . " Sierra blew her nose . " Wonderful husband , " she muttered . " He 's a male chauvinist pig . Alex probably has n't even bothered to mention this to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father would have . I think Alex has stayed here for ten years because of you . It 's time you allow him to do what he needs to do to make full use of the talents he has . " It was the last thing Sierra wanted to hear . She did n't reply as she ran her hand along the books in an old shelf . She knew what her mother said had merit , but that did n't mean she wanted to listen . Alex had received other offers and turned each down after discussing them with her . She had thought the decisions mutual , but now she wondered . He had sounded so excited and happy when he talked to her about this job ... . She plucked Winnie the Pooh out and blew dust off the top . Stroking the front of the book , she remembered sitting in her mother 's lap as the story was read to her . How many times had she heard it ? The cover was worn from handling . Just thinking about leaving and not being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days left Sierra feeling bereft . Tears blurred her vision . " Alex gave notice this morning . " She pushed the book back into its space . " It was the first thing he did after he got the call from Los Angeles . Then he called me with the great news . " Covering her face , she wept . Sierra felt some comfort when her mother 's arms came around her . " It 'll be all right , honey . You 'll see . " Her mother stroked her back as though she were a child . " Things have a way of working out for the best . The Lord has plans for you and for Alex , plans for your good , not your destruction . Trust him . " The Lord ! Why did her mother always have to bring up the Lord ? What sort of plan was it to tear people 's lives apart ? She withdrew from her mother 's arms . " All our friends are here . You 're here . I do n't want to move . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in Los Angeles that he does n't already have here ? " " Maybe he wants the chance to prove himself . " " He has proven himself . He 's succeeded at everything he 's ever done . " " Maybe he does n't feel he 's done enough . " " He does n't have to prove anything to me , " Sierra said , her voice choked . " Sometimes men have to prove things to themselves , Sierra . " She took her daughter 's hand . " Sit , honey . " She drew her down onto the old faded couch . Patting her hand , she smiled wistfully . " I remember Alex talking with your father about all the frustrations he felt in his job . " " Daddy was the one who told Alex to settle in and stay put so he 'd have all the benefits . " " Your father was worried Alex would do the same thing he did . " She blew her nose and glanced at her mother . " What do you mean ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled into real estate . " " He did ? I do n't remember that . " " You were too young to notice . " Her mother smiled wistfully . " Your father intended to be a high school biology teacher . " " Daddy ? A teacher ? " She could n't imagine it . He would n't have put up with anything . The first student to shoot a spit wad would have found himself upside-down in a garbage can outside the classroom door . Her mother laughed . " Yes , Daddy . He spent five years in college preparing to do just that and after one year in a classroom decided he hated it . He said the girls were all airheads and the boys were running on testosterone . " Sierra smiled , amazed and amused . " I ca n't even imagine . " " Your dad went to work in a lab then . He hated that , too . He said staring into microscopes all day bored him senseless . So he went to work for a men 's clothing store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , Daddy . You and Mike were both in school when he quit . After that , he trained to become a police officer . I was as strongly against that as you are against moving to Los Angeles . " She patted Sierra 's hand again . " But good came out of it . I used to lie awake at night , worrying myself sick over him . I was so sure something would happen to him . Those years were the worst of my life , and our marriage suffered because of it . And yet the greatest blessing came from it , too . I became a Christian while your father was working the eleven-to-seven shift as a highway patrolman . " " I did n't know all this , Mom . " " Why would you ? A mother hardly shares these kinds of struggles with her young children . You were four and Mike was seven . Neither of you were happy . You sensed the tension between us and did n't understand . You did n't see that much of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the day .

He gave it a try and loved it . As God would have it , he started at the time when real estate was booming . It was a seller 's market . Within two years of getting his license , your dad was one of the top Realtors in Sonoma County . He became so busy , he dropped residential and specialized in commercial properties . " She squeezed Sierra 's hand . " The point I 'm trying to make is this , honey : It took your father sixteen years to settle into a career he enjoyed . " She smiled . " Alex knew what he wanted to do when he went to college . The trouble is he 's never had the opportunity to accomplish it . The greatest gift you can give him is the freedom to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra wanted to hear . " You talk as though I 've put a ball and chain around his neck . " She stood and began pacing again . " I 'd like to have been consulted , Mom . Is that so hard to understand ? Alex did n't even discuss the offer with me . He accepted it and then informed me of his decision . It 's not fair . " " Who ever said life was fair ? " her mother responded , hands folded . Sierra felt defensive and angry . " Daddy did n't make you move . " " No , he did n't . I would have been delighted if he had . " Sierra turned and stared at her . " I thought you loved Healdsburg . " " Now I do . When I was younger , all I could think about was getting away from here . I thought how wonderful it would be to live in a big city like San Francisco where lots of things were going on . You know I grew up on Grandma 's farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anything but exciting , honey . I wanted to go to the theater and attend concerts . I wanted to immerse myself in museums and culture . I wanted to walk through Golden Gate Park . And , despite warnings and pleadings from my parents , I did just that . " " And met Daddy . " " Yes . He rescued me from a mugging on the Pan Handle . " Sierra thought of the wedding photo on the mantel downstairs . Her father 's hair had been long then , and his " tuxedo " consisted of worn Levi 's and heavy boots ; her mother , dressed in a black turtleneck and Capri pants , had woven flowers in her waist-length auburn hair . The photo had always jarred with the image she had of her parents . They had been young onceand rebellious , too . Her mother smiled , remembering . " If I 'd had my way , we would have settled in San Francisco . " " You never told me that before . " " By the time you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed drastically . Just as your ideas will change . Life is n't static , Sierra . Thank God . It 's constantly in motion . Sometimes we find ourselves caught up in currents and carried along where we do n't want to go . Then we find out later that God 's hand was in it all along . " " God did n't make the decision to move to Los Angeles . Alex made it . But then , I suppose he thinks he 's God . " Sierra could hear the resentment in her voice , but she hardened herself against any regret or guilt . Emotions raged and warred within her : resentment that Alex had made such a decision without talking to her beforehand ; fear that if she fought him , she 'd lose anyway ; terror of leaving a life she loved and found so comfortable . " What am I going to do , Mom ? " " That 's up to you , honey , " her mother said gently , tears of compassion in her eyes . " I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we love one another as we love ourselves , Sierra . Forget yourself and think about what Alex needs . Love him accordingly . " " If I do that , he 'll walk all over me . Next time , he 'll jump at a job in New York City ! " She knew she was being unfair even as she said it . Alex had given her two beautiful children , a nice three-bedroom home in Windsor , and a secure , happy life . Life had been so smooth , in fact , she had never once suspected the turmoil within him . Realizing that frightened her . It made her feel she did n't know Alex 's heart or mind as well as she thought she did . She could n't see a way out . Part of her wanted to pick up the children from school and come back here to the Mathesen Street home and let Alex face the real estate woman alone ; he could n't sell the house if she did n't sign . But she knew if she did that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt him , he had retreated into anger , putting up a cold front and withdrawing into silence . He did n't come from a family of yellers . She did n't even want to think about how he would respond if she hurt and angered him deliberately . " It might help to take your mind off the matter for a few hours and then try to think about it later , " her mother said . Heart aching , Sierra sat down on the sofa again . She looked at the open trunk and piles of boxes . " Why are you doing all this now , Mom ? " Something flickered in her mother 's eyes . " It 's a good winter activity , do n't you think ? " She glanced around . " It 's such a mess . Your father and I meant to go through all this stuff years ago , but then ... " She looked sad . " Time has a way of getting away from us . " She looked around the room at the odd assortment of treasures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to leave all this chaos for you and Mike to have to figure out . " She rose and walked around the attic , brushing her hand lightly over an old rocking chair , a bookshelf , a baby 's pram . " I 'm going to sort and put all of Mike 's and your things over there in the north corner . You two can decide what you want to keep and what you want to throw away . Special things from your father 's family and mine , I 'll repack . Most of your father 's papers from the business can be burned . There 's no point in keeping them . And Grandpa 's paintings ... some of them are disintegrating . " " Some of them are really bad , " Sierra said , grinning . " That , too , " her mother agreed with a laugh . " It kept him occupied . " She stopped near the window , glancing out at the front lawn , her expression pensive . " There are a lot of family papers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and Mike . " She glanced back at Sierra and smiled . " It 's a big job , but I think it 'll be fun and interesting . " She came back and sat down on the old flowered sofa . " This trunk belonged to Mary Kathryn McMurray . She was one of your ancestors . She came across the plains in a wagon in 1847 . I was just glancing through her journal when you came , " she said , taking up a leather-bound volume from the trunk and brushing her hand over it . " I had n't gotten very far . Apparently , this was an assignment book and then it became her diary . " She set the volume between them on the couch . Sierra picked it up and opened it , reading the childish scrawl on the first page . Mama says livin in the wildurnes ai nt no resun to bee ignurant . Her papa wuz a larnud man and wud not want fuls in his famlee . " The trunk was part of Grandpa Clanton 's estate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through these things in years . " She lifted out a small carved wooden box . " Oh , I remember this , " she said , smiling . Inside was an embroidered silk handkerchief . She unfolded it carefully and showed Sierra the antique gold chain and amethyst cross . " Oh , it 's beautiful , " Sierra said , taking it and admiring it . " You may have it , if you 'd like . " " I 'd love it , " Sierra said , opening the small clasp and putting it on . Her mother took out an old tintype in an oval frame . The couple were dressed in wedding clothes , their expressions solemn rather than joyful . The groom was handsome in his dark suit and starched shirt , his dark hair brushed back cleanly from chiseled features and intense pale eyes . Blue , Sierra decided . They would have had to be blue to be so pale in the picture . The bride was very young and lovely . She was wearing a gorgeous white lace Victorian wedding dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted upon her shoulder . Sierra took out another box . Inside , wrapped in tissue paper , was a small woven Indian basket with designs . Around the top edge were quail plumes and beads . " I think this is a gift basket , Mom . It 's worth a lot of money . They have them in the Indian Museum at Sutter 's Fort . " " Is there anything inside the box to tell about it ? " Sierra removed everything and shook her head . " Nothing . " " Look at this old Bible , " her mother said , distracted . As she opened it , a section slipped free and fell onto the floor . Her mother picked it up and placed it on the sofa beside her . Sierra picked up the paper yellowed with age and read the pretty script . Dearest Mary Kathryn , I hope you have changed your mind about God . He loves you very much and He is watching over you . I do not know what hardships and losses you will face on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the trail . What I do know is God will never leave you nor forsake you . You have my love and are in my morning and evening prayers . The ladies from the quilting club send their love as well , as do Betsy and Clovis . May the Lord bless your new home . Aunt Martha Sierra 's mother thumbed through the black , cracked leather Bible and then picked up the portion that had fallen . " Look at how worn the pages are . " She smiled . " Mary Kathryn favored the Gospels . " She took the note from Sierra and read it . Folding it , she tucked it in the loosened pages and set the Bible carefully beside Mary Kathryn McMurray 's journal . Sierra took out a decaying flowered hat box . She found a note on top saying simply , in beautiful black calligraphy , " Save for Joshua McMurray . " The box was full of animals , carved of wood , each wrapped carefully in a scrap of flowered calico or checked gingham . She unwrapped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a prairie dog standing on its hind legs , a comical jackrabbit , a beautiful antelope , two mountain goats locked together in fierce battle , and a grizzly bear standing on its hind legs , ready to attack . At the bottom of the trunk was a large package wrapped in butcher paper and tied with string . " I do n't remember this , " her mother said and slipped the string off so she could remove the wrapping . " Oh , " she said in wonder and excitement . " I think it 's a crazy quilt . " She unfolded it enough so that Sierra could take one end of it and then stood , spreading the folds to reveal the full pattern . It was n't a crazy quilt , but a picture quilt with squares made of hundreds of different scraps of cloth , each with a different scene , each framed with an edging of brown , and all stitched together with vibrant scarlet thread . Each picture block was surrounded by a different stitch : blanket , crosses , herringbone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cretan , fly , zigzag chain , wheatear and sheaf filling stitches , Portuguese border , and star eyelets . " It 's beautiful , " Sierra said , wishing she could have it . " If I 'd known it was here , I would have had it cleaned and hung on the living room wall years ago , " her mother said . Sierra looked at the squares one by one . Along the top row was a homestead with a man , a woman , and three children . Two boys and a girl stood in the open space between the cabin and barn . The second square was bright with consuming flames . The third showed a baby in a manger , a young girl watching over him while darkness surrounded them both . The telephone rang downstairs . A second later , the portable phone rang from nearby . Sierra 's mother handed her the other end of the quilt and went to pick up the phone from the top of a box and answer it . " Yes , she 's here , Alex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she folded the quilt while listening to her mother 's side of the conversation . " Yes , she told me . Yes , but that 's to be expected , Alex . " Her mother 's tone held no condemnation or disappointment . She was silent for a long moment , listening again . " I know that , Alex , " she said very gently , her voice husky with emotion , " and I 've always been thankful . You do n't have to explain . " Another silence . " So soon , " her mother said , resigned . " How are your parents taking it ? Oh . Well , I imagine it 's going to be a shock to them as well . " She smiled faintly . " Of course , Alex . You know I will . Let me know after you 've spoken to them , and I 'll call . " Marianna cupped her hand over the receiver . " Alex wants to talk to you . " Sierra wanted to say she did n't want to talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She laid the folded quilt back over the trunk and crossed the attic to take the phone from her mother 's hand . " I 'll make us some coffee , " her mother said with a gentle smile . Sierra watched her go down the stairs , knowing her mother was allowing her privacy to speak with Alex . She felt a tangle of emotions , from relief to despair . Her mother had n't said one word to discourage Alex from his decision . Why not ? " Yes ? " she said into the receiver , her voice coming out thin and choked . She wanted to scream at him and could barely draw breath past the pain in her chest . Her throat was tight and dry . " I was worried about you . " " Were you ? " Why should he worry about her just because he was ripping her life apart ? Resentment filled her and hot tears welled again in her eyes . " You 're not saying much . " " What do you want me to say ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that would be expecting too much , especially considering this is the biggest opportunity of my career . " She heard the tinge of disappointment and anger in his voice . What right had he to be angry with her after making a life-changing decision without so much as hinting it to her ? " I 'm sure the children will be thrilled to hear they 're being uprooted and torn away from their friends and family . " " We 're their family . " " What about Mom ? What about your parents ? " " We 're not moving to New York , Sierra . " " I guess you 're saving that for next year 's big surprise . " Silence followed . Her heart picked up speed ; she could feel his growing anger . Stop this now , an inner voice cautioned her . Stop before you go too far ... . She was n't interested in stopping . " You might have hinted what was going on , Alex , " she said , clutching the phone . " I 've done more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . I 've been telling you for the last four years what I want to do . The problem is you do n't listen . " " I listen . " " And never hear . " " I do too hear ! " " Then hear this . You 've had it your way for ten years . Maybe , just for a change , you could cut me a little slack . " Click . " Alex ? " Dead silence filled her ear . Sierra blinked , shocked . She stared at the phone in her hand as though it had turned to a venomous snake . Alex had never hung up on her before . More distressed than when she had arrived , Sierra went downstairs . The tantalizing aroma of freshly ground caramel au lait decaf filled the kitchen . Her favorite . So , too , were the Tollhouse cookies her mother had put on a dessert plate in the sunny alcove overlooking the back garden . Clearly Mom wanted to cheer her up . Fat chance . She plunked the portable phone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank down onto the chair . " He hung up on me . " Her mother poured coffee for her . " He 's never hung up on me before , " Sierra continued , her voice breaking as she looked up at her mother . He 'd made a decision he knew would tear her life to pieces , and then he hung up on her ? " He said I do n't listen . " Her mother set the carafe on a sunflower trivet and took the seat facing her . " Sometimes we only hear what we want to hear . " She picked up her coffee cup and sipped , distracted . " You look tired , Mom . " " I did n't sleep very well last night . I kept thinking about your father . " Her mouth curved faintly , her expression softening . " Sometimes I imagine him sitting in his chair watching the news on television . The house creaks and I awaken , thinking he 's coming along to bed . " She smiled sadly and looked down into her coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I miss him . " " I miss him , too . " He might have been able to talk Alex out of going to Los Angeles . Her mother lifted her head and looked across at her with gentle humor . " Your father was n't an easy man either , Sierra , but he was worth it . " " If Alex insists , I 'll go , but I do n't have to smile and pretend to be happy about it . " " Maybe not , but it 'd be better if you came to terms with his decision . Resentment and anger eat away at love as quickly as rust is corroding that metal lawn chair out there in the backyard . One of life 's great tragedies is watching a relationship unravel over something that could 've been resolved in one intelligent , adult conversation . " Her mother 's words hurt . " One conversation is n't going to change Alex 's mind . " " Then it depends on what you really want . " Sierra raised tear-soaked eyes to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " Marianna reached out and took her daughter 's hand . " It 's simple , Sierra . Do you want your own way , or do you want Alex ? "
