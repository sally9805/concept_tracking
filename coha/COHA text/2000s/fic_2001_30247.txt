On the runway , passenger Winston Mabie began to narrate his flight home in the manner of his own obituary . Or , since he would note the milestones of survival , maybe it would be more proper to call what he was constructing an antiobituary . " Winston Mabie did not perish on takeoff , nor shortly after , " he observed to himself once airborne , the plane struggling under him like a goose , urging itself upward , on a wing and a prayer . " Winston Mabie has survived the first minute of his trip . " A former girlfriend once told him that most airplane accidents occurred in the initial forty-five seconds after the wheels left the ground ; her habit had been to count slowly to forty-five and then relax , reassured by statistics . Winston gave himself a full three hundred measure , good and easy " two hundred fourteen , two hundred fifteen " before even pretending to slacken . He tallied as he breathed , glancing over his seatmate out the window where the gray riveted wing protruded like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to watch it from here to Wichita , waiting for it to fall off , to wobble and creak , to leak greasy fuel or burst into flame . And did n't those rivets need paint ? " Remember that Twilight Zone gremlin ? " he said , sort of to himself , right after whispering " three hundred . " " Beg pardon ? " " I hate to fly , " he murmured . His companion nodded distractedly . She 'd already unpacked a load of work , her hands flashing over a computer keyboard , their ten gleaming fingernails the color of freshly minted pennies , thumb firm on the space bar . Copper , the nail polish would be named . Her toenails , he thought , would match . The plane climbed and banked , shimmering as if relieved if not amazed at its own ability to lunge , once again , into the wild blue yonder . I thought I could , I thought I could , it seemed to be saying . Apparently it was n't going to be caught unawares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . He would have preferred being driven to his parents ' house , and ideally by his little sister Mona , but the ticket had arrived from his mother , her last missive addressed to him at Larned , and , since he was the son of depression era Democrats , both of them frugal and practical , he knew it had cost her more than its dollar price , and accepted his boarding pass without protest . Accepted it , and then handed it over as if in exchange for his life . Flying he hated ; yet what awaited him , at the other end , he would no doubt also hate . Winston surveyed , as best he could , the aerial view of his homeland . How would it be to die today , above the wheat fields and the grain elevators ? From overhead , the elevators did n't resemble toilet paper rolls , as you might expect , but simple gray disks in the otherwise green landscape . It was awfully green , as rain had been falling ceaselessly in the Midwest this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring behavior . The Missouri River was swollen , as was the Kaw , the various declines around the countryside filled with water , reflecting the hazy sun back at the sky . The plane 's shadow passed over the land like a premonition . Green and gray , puddles , patches , a great black looming storm approaching from the west , which was the direction Winston was aimed . It irked him that he might endure all the trauma at this end of the flight only to perish at that end . If it had to happen , he wished it would be now , save him the trouble of agonizing and brooding for the next hour .... Would n't it be queer , down there , to find the body parts of an airline accident ? Scattered digits like buckshot , pieces pelting the tin farmhouse roofs and QuikTrips and the heads of farmers , the parking lots and their cars , the vast empty stretches of the north or south forty ? But maybe the Midwestern farmer was prepared for the impact of parts , having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernatural force into their phone poles and front doors . " Winston Mabie did not succumb to turbulence over Olathe . " Below him , just north , sat his alma mater , the University of Kansas , his former dorm rooms and housemates he latched on to one in order to claim his attention , direct his anxiety to the category of memory , what was she called , that strange roommate , Jennifer , who 'd changed her name to Cassandra , who thought she was a witch , who could n't drive her car so instead painted it with psychedelic house paint , crosses and bats and other funky discordant iconography .... He had n't flown in more than five years , but it was all coming back to him , surging over him with familiar fears and hopes . Your comrades , sitting in alarming proximity , might be sensitive to your fear , or nursing their own , or they might be bemused , ignoring your presence despite your knee knocking against theirs , your cough in their ear , their collar and dander in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust , retreat . Other passengers seemed to think of flight as either an opportunity to reflect with closed eyes , or to read a book , or to open a computer screen or magazine or catalog or safety guide from the elasticized pouch before them . They might casually consider the 747 diagram provided them and learn osmotically how to exit in case of emergency . The calmness of most passengers only served to exaggerate his fright ; someone had to keep the thing aloft , praying and parlaying and striking unkeepable bargains . " I hate to fly , " he might comment moodily to his neighbor , as he had to this one , who on other flights might have agreed , she or he did , too , or who might smile indulgently , noncommittally , and return to an open , popular , poorly written novel . This person might strike up a conversation , might indulge some horror story of flight , might ask what he did for a living . How Winston relished the anonymity of this forced intimacy there beside him sat someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create . He could be anyone : author , playboy , student , surgeon . Loyal son , zealous uncle , caring brother . Into most of this invention entered an aspect of truth , or at least of desired truth . In the abstract , climbing to 30,000 feet , Winston certainly wished he were honest and wise and humble and kind , modest and temperate and pious and sweet . His seatmate surely wanted it . Perhaps all the passengers of Flight 500 felt the same , hopeful for his success . Or utterly indifferent , either response one he could embrace . It was the response waiting for him on the ground that troubled him . Down there there would be guardedness and suspicion and pity and solicitous kindness . He imposed an exercise in distraction . First , did n't he want a cigarette ? Was n't he a pack-and-a-half-a-day man ? Ought n't that to be absorbing him at present ? Was n't his system hungry for his friend nicotine ? And what about those flight attendants , two hefty middle-aged women , twin grinning Vikings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety procedures , their cavalier treatment of the oxygen mask and the seat-belt buckle enough to make anyone see how perfectly safe he was in their hands , how needlessly worried ... Still , even though the flight was n't full , Winston took a moment to stew about the stewardesses ' heft . What if the plane were too heavy to hurl itself smoothly from here to there ? What had happened to the regulations that had kept previous stewardesses trim and shapely , role models of anorexic teenage girls , subject matter of male pornographic fantasy ? How the hell had these Wide Loads squeaked through flight attendant training .... It stunned him how quickly his thinking had shifted from its recent course to its older habit , how swiftly he 'd moved out of prison . Never would he have guessed that flying would still frighten him . He 'd thought he 'd found subsuming fears to occupy him . But with each subtle bump , every minor instance of turbulence , his heart pattered . He touched the smiling scar at the base of his skull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To touch it brought a sweet nausea , a wave of willed discomfort , punching the built-in punish button . This was his pain , his and no one else 's . It was a queasy combination , guilt and horror and simple sadness to touch it brought back a particular flashing moment , the interior of the car just after impact . And inasmuch as it tormented him , it also reminded him of who he was . This was his scar , his memory , pitiless and private , possession and stigma . He used to be a driver , behind the wheel , in charge of his craft and master of his fortune . Of course , he had not driven a vehicle since the accident that had landed him in prison . This was a change he would have to accept in his character . He had now no desire to drive . In prison he had worked hard to adopt a philosophy that would permit him not to need a car . Something along the lines of a reach never exceeding its grasp , a destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bus line , he supposed now , observing the sheer space of his home state . Perhaps in a large city one could live without a car , but in the rural Midwest ? In the boxy horizontal scatter of strip malls and suburbs and the long empty stretches between ? Where property was habitually described in terms of acres and counties ? He should have taken the bus home from Kansas City . " Keep your nose clean , " advised Sonny Noisome , Winston 's favorite of the guards . Sonny had only one eye . Winston had come to trust the advice of the injured , the damaged , those who had lived to tell . Over the PA system rustled the voice of the captain . His name was James Taylor . Winston sort of liked James Taylor the singer , even though he whined . In music , Winston 's taste tended toward the sentimental , the ballad , the whiners . His little sister Mona liked to listen to people who were in some deeply developed stage of outrage or irony , nihilism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor the pilot sounded more like John Wayne the cowpoke . He said he was taking the plane " upstairs " and on the way they might experience what he called " chop . " Winston marveled . See how the world went on inventing new ways to say the same things ? Even in his absence , this had happened : planes went upstairs , under the threat of chop and people like James Taylor were doing their best to " keep it smooth . " Down below , Winston believed he could pick out Emporia , which reminded him of the six years he 'd spent making pit stops there , en route home from Lawrence , cotton-mouthed , red-eyed , aimed toward the weekend of doing laundry , eating his mother 's cooking , sleeping in his giant bed , cranking up to return to school . College had suited him , better than anything else . Education , before college , had been to a large degree about avoiding conflict the conflict of the playground , of boys , of team sports . Winston hated competition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . His natural inclinations sympathetic teachers had always labeled him " sensitive " had worked in his favor . He grew out his hair and started wearing sandals . The loveliest girls wanted to sleep with him . In a class on feminist literature , he had actually been mistaken for a girl ; the professor opened her anthology , scanned the length of the long seminar table , and declared how glad she was to see a roomful of women . And this had n't appalled Winston , not in the least . At East High he would have balked , he would have never lived it down , but at the University of Kansas he felt thrilled , included , camouflaged to advantage . He 'd slept with four of those women over the course of the semester , including Dr. Ringley . He would never experience that same ease in the world again . He felt suddenly sorry for himself , a wave of despair upon him . He had looked toward release from prison , had marked that time as his goal , his one concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could be free , he thought , flying mysteriously through the air , and still trapped . Trapped by former happiness , by a knowledge of diminishing returns , by a cowardly nature . He ran his finger over his scar again , just to locate himself , just to feel his unique queasy pain . The service cart was coming down the aisle , the seat-belt lights had gone off , the nose of the plane seemed satisfied with its altitude and allowed the tail to catch up , make itself level . Cruising altitude , his captain claimed cockily . Statistically , this was the part of the flight least likely to kill a person , but Winston could not reconcile the reasonability of statistics with the irrational and ludicrous fact that he was 33,000 feet above land . What sort of fool put himself in a vessel such as this , an aged flying bus whose interior shimmied as if to shed its exoskeleton , and allowed himself to be catapulted into the atmosphere ? Preposterous . Of course millions of similar fools endured air travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd smash off the interstate driving to the airport than explode in his plane the same ex-girlfriend of the forty-five seconds had also told him it was more likely he 'd be hit by a meteorite than die in an airplane . Surely his odds of getting knifed in the exercise yard over five years ' time were better . Yes , plenty of people survived many years of air service , there was probably an entire squadron of retired stewardesses , they probably had reunions , maybe they chartered a goddamned airplane for their reunions , what about old Chuck Yeager and Charles Lindbergh and all those military personnel , prevailing despite bombs and bad weather and tricky sworn enemies whose whole raison d'tre was to blast them from the skies , all sorts of ill-fated adventures during all sorts of wars . Think of his own father , veteran of World War II , lying in the bomb bay of a tiny little plane , coming home over the Atlantic ... The 747 lurched suddenly , seeming to fall in the way of the roller coaster , a plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then head . No matter your thinking the body would always betray : Winston was still terrified of flying . The drink cart clanked . Instantly the seat-belt light dinged on . James Taylor &shy; John Wayne came over the public address system , all mellow cowhand reassurance : " Well folks , we 're experiencing some unexpected turbulence , just a little bumpy air , so I 'm gon na " He cut off abruptly . What was he gon na ? Winston clutched his seat arms , touching the pale cream sleeve of his seatmate with his elbow . She removed her arm without missing a beat in her typing . Unflappable , Winston thought . " Winston Mabie and his unflappable neighbor made it through a bit of bumpy upstairs air . " " I hate to fly , " he repeated aloud , sincere and contrite . The plane shuddered once more . " Winston Mabie made it through the bumpy air ? " he narrated weakly , a kind of plea . It surprised him to find that he did not want to die ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , the service cart proceeded toward him . He tried to take solace in the serene expression on the stewardess 's face . Surely she was destined to reach retirement from American Airlines , see her fiftieth or sixtieth birthday , fly in much worse circumstances and come through those trips , too , make it home to greet her husband week after week . Maybe he was a pilot : doctors married nurses , professors married coeds , pilots married stewardesses . His grandmother Bunny had enjoyed flying , he remembered . That ought to cheer him , that someone as wise and ancient as Bunny had liked to fly . Simultaneous with this relaxing memory was Winston 's recollection that the anniversary of her death was disturbingly impending . Or was it past ? This week , certainly , odd he could n't remember which day . Five years . Just the sight of a certain kind of old woman 's hair made him remember his grandmother , a wavy yellowish gray , bobbed , her hands cupped under her ears , bouncing the skirt of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighties . She had a way of tipping her head like a bird listening to the noise underground , cocking her glance in your direction , a half-smile , big blue eyes like his , the narrow nose his sisters always claimed to envy , her thick hair he also had inherited , not hay-colored like hers but black , wasted on a boy , according to his sisters ... A baby began crying , its shriek blood-chilling . Winston 's heart leapt . Infants , like animals , might sense danger before the average dulled adult instinct would . It was a premonition , an omen . When flying , everything became an omen . For instance , the lipstick smeared on the stewardess 's lower lip could such slovenliness be tolerated from the mannequin sensibility of flight attendance ? or the " human organ " cooler box he 'd noted in first class , blaze-orange tape lashed round its contents as if they 'd just been pulled , warm , from a dying body , or even the trash left in his pouch from a bag of candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thirteen D ? ! ? Thirteen ? Why , if high-rises were erected without a thirteenth floor , if elevators went without mentioning the number , surely the airline industry ought to know better . Good god , how could he be sitting in ... The plane bumped again , boat on rough water , toy falling down the steps , forcing Winston to remember the way the ground crew had been scuttling around just before takeoff . What had they been doing out there ? Had that been panic on their faces ? Were they trying to communicate something to the pilot , who was probably guzzling at his hip flask and adjusting his Stetson instead of concentrating on the business of piloting ? Should Winston have intervened , buzzed his buzzer , notified authorities ? Had something flammable leaked from a fuselage ? What was a fuselage , anyway ? Some asshole was always proclaiming nothing to fear but fear itself . This did not take into account death , dismemberment , heartbreak , or financial ruin . It neglected pain of all sorts . It passed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dear John letters . Anonymous phone calls , rabid dogs , toxic toadstools , loneliness , crowds , boredom , or hyperactivity . The loss of memory , paralysis , eviction , the big bad wolf , temptation , consummation , Mack trucks , motor scooters , wild geese , alligators , the dark , the basement , the attic , the creepy antique dealer . The killer on your left eating pork and beans , the child molester on your right eating the same , the arsonist , the rapist , the man who fed his wife rat poison . Flying . Fear itself , separate from its subject , was just another bodily function , a revved bloodstream , an anatomical jumpstart , a swift kick in the adrenal gland . Winston 's flight seemed cursed , as all his flights had . Perhaps this one seemed particularly treacherous because he had n't flown in such a long time and he 'd lost the knack . He 'd survived a relentless and humiliating and terrifying incarceration , and now , free , had to suffer more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , in his heightened fear , a hopeless fantasy . Life was not going to be necessarily easy , this flight home was teaching him . This was step one . All around him seemed people destined to die . The women behind him , for example , across the aisle in seats 14A , B , and C , all three clutching dolls as if they were real babies , rag dolls wrapped in scarves , swaddled near their armpits . The women had their eyes closed . Were they in a cult ? Grief therapy ? What the hell were they doing on his flight ? Why in the world should the three of them anticipate seeing the light of another day on this planet ? Directly across the aisle , 13C , sat an older woman who kept placing her paperback on her little tray table only to have it slide to her lap . Over and over it slid . Perseverating behavior , he recalled from some psych class , indicating a certain kind of brain trauma . Despite trusting the message of the damaged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted to be counted among the able , the worthy , those who fit and were necessary . Everyone on this flight seemed utterly expendable , even the partial person in first class , the " human organ " in the cooler box , on its way to some poor one strapped in a hospital bed . A tragedy in the wings . Winston looked around , seeking out military types , CEOs . Those people just kept surviving ; where were they when you needed them to secure your own survival ? He wanted to snatch the sliding book away from the woman and fling it down the aisle , right into the backside of the stewardess as she trundled nearer with her ominous cart of fluids . Beside him , the businesswoman typed complacently , aggressive thumb banging on the space bar . Winston attempted to read her screen , but it was not text . It was a pie graph . She was consulting numbers and then blipping to another place , so quickly Winston could n't track the data . Almost imperceptibly he registered her knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , requested ginger ale when asked . Ginger ale : the beverage of the fully actualized adult . " And you ? " " Scotch , " Winston blurted . His heart pounded in his throat . He had n't had a drink in five years . But what better time than now , at 33,000 feet , seated in the chariot conveying him to his death ? " ID ? " asked his looming stewardess . " ID ? " Winston repeated , not understanding . " Identification . Are you of age . " Beside him , the computer woman finally looked up . Winston reached automatically for his wallet despite not having reached for it in years elbowing his seatmate in the upper arm as he did so . " Sorry , " he murmured , his face burning . He did not have a driver 's license , revoked at the accident scene , and his K.U. ID had expired in 1988 , when he 'd last matriculated . His other cards he did not wish to extract , the feeble effects of a marginal citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolescent video rental . " I 'm thirty-three , " he said , turning his face upward to the stewardess . And her expression registered his age , he thought . It registered a face he 'd learned to make during his stay at Larned , new to the world outside that place , one that insisted you shalt not fuck with me . All his life , he 'd been mistaken as younger than his years because he smiled a lot , because he was handsome . It was n't intentional , it was just the way his face went . A laid-back face , a girlfriend had told him once . A beautiful laid-back face . She liked to study it after sex . Her own , she 'd claimed , was not as nice . But now he 'd scared the stewardess with his other face . " Coffee , " Winston said . " Forget the scotch . " In the unserved seats behind him , Winston could sense restlessness ; he 'd taken up enough of the stewardess 's time with his foolishness , people needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was handed a cup and a tiny packet called Whitener . " Whitener ? " he said to his seatmate , who had gone back to her pie graph . Winston laughed hollowly . Suddenly the plane dipped again . Winston clutched his seat as if holding it might help right the thing , as if he could steer them through turbulence from back here , the extraordinary power of sheer nervous energy . But they kept dipping , the nose aimed downward , his whitened coffee trembling at a definite declined angle , the surface quivering like Winston 's hands . If he were a farmer in a field , would he look up now and watch the little 747 fall out of the sky , over there behind the wheat fields , silently , a tiny problem of someone else 's , a mess of shrapnel and gruesome human body parts in a fellow farmer 's barnyard , a fire in the haystack , a trail of black smoke pluming not unaesthetically heavenward ? About suffering they were never wrong , Winston remembered , those helpless scissoring feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilling in the foreground . Again he remembered college , the adrenaline of insight , the intensity of the sun on the front porch of the last house he 'd lived in , with the witch and the computer nerd and the alcoholic premed student and the working girl , Jeannette , with her romance novels and peculiar sleeping hours . Jeannette worked at the plastic factory , checking those margarine tubs night after night , reading her romances during the day . Jeannette , Jennifer ne Cassandra ( or was it Cassandra n &@233; e Jennifer ? ) , Oliver , McFarland , Winston himself , the string hammock on the porch , the diamond-shaped impressions it left on your thigh skin like butcher-netted meat , the fall-winter-spring sunshine , the pile of books and the deadlines of essays and take-home exams and the brilliant campus on the hill like the Emerald City , like El Dorado , the trilling campanile , the pond and the big tail-waving dogs with Frisbees and their useless purple or red bandanna collars , and garage bands , and pickup volleyball , and keggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live from Kansas City , meanwhile ideas rocketing through the body like the new substance of all vital fluids , blood , saliva , sweat , tears , and semen , holding forth with good-hearted girls who felt the same , who fell into bed weary but willing , perfect , more perfect , most perfect . He could cry to think all of that was over , forever , for him . More descending . How much descending could a plane do before it found itself nose-dived in a bog ? But his captain returned to inform them this ear-popping plunge was intentional , nothing more than the initial descent into Wichita , the old air capital city herself , that explained the dipping , the activity in Winston 's ears , the return of the wide-bottomed stewardess with a plastic bag to collect debris . His seatmate clicked off her screen and snapped shut her computer , which resembled a small bathroom scale . " I 've never seen a computer that tiny , " Winston said . " Yes , " she answered , unsurprised , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of landing next to him in the seating lottery of his lack of savvy in the world of computers , fashion , grace , and flight . She could n't have been much older than he but seemed quite firmly established in another camp , on the other side of an important line drawn somewhere in the sand , the side that made money and decisions , the side that ran industry and commerce . On the one hand , she depressed Winston . His good looks were n't charming her . He seemed to have lost his touch . But on the other hand , she was quite definitely a survivor , which meant he would ride her coattails to terra firma . His older sister Emily was like this woman , competent and able , the sort Winston had liked to undo , in the old days . Beneath him Winston felt the wheels erupt from their cargo space . Out the window , a section of the ledge-like wing rose , another opened out , flaps and props . The improbable whirring gadgetry of approach . Irrationally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant he was closer to the ground . Statistically , he seemed to recall that it was the most dangerous , the forty-five seconds at the end of the journey , but he was happy to recognize landlocked objects , highways and cars and barns and cows . Good old cows , chewing through their days . Surely his odds were better than any one of the cows ' down there ? They were n't standing in a pasture because they 'd been spared the rendering plant they were just waiting . " Winston Mabie 's flight did not culminate in a lightning strike or tornado as he entered the Wichita region , home of Pizza Hut and Boeing . " The paperback woman now slid her plastic drink glass down her tray table , over and over , until the stewardess made a last pass . Then the woman hid her cup , folded away her tray until the stewardess had gone , then let it down again to continue her game . " Hey ! " Winston said , clinging to rules and propriety as a way of ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her face , when she turned his way , terrified him . On it he saw a fear much larger than his own , shimmering on the scrim of her features . Her pale blue eyes were filled with tears , her small mouth trembled , her loose cheeks were the crepey pink of fair skin grown old . " I 'm sorry , " she mouthed soundlessly . She handed Winston her cup , righted her table , then pushed herself against her seat back so hard her gnarled knuckles turned white on the armrest , blue veins so prominent they ought to have burst . Though she was nothing like his grandmother , the woman made Winston remember his Bunny , and this made him sigh . He had been responsible for her death , five years ago , and although he could long for Lawrence and his college days , his actual destination was Wichita and his family . Not his past , but his future . His parents , his two sisters , the house where he 'd grown up and become who he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to belly flop on the landing strip . " Reverse backthrust would now explode into its appropriate parachute-like anchoring use , and Winston Mabie would survive . Oh , maybe all of this was useful , this preparation for death . If he dreaded seeing his family so , perhaps it would be just as well if the plane fell earthward , met its demise , sucked in a hapless pigeon or duck to tangle its engine . So long cruel expectation , so long to his own cruel disregard of the same . They would forgive him , he thought , if he died today . They would stand at his grave and regret his death . And was n't that all anyone could expect or hope for ? Their grief made him swear to himself to be good to his family , should he make it through this loud and terrifying landing . Winston recalled other bargains made with God for his survival through a flight . Had n't he sworn to stop lying ? Stop belittling fools ? Stop drinking ? Now he 'd be punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scotch , lying and bleating to God as he approached yet another arrival , a hurtle onto the ground from the air on indelicate wings . Now God would get him for reneging , put him through the whole of this tortuous flight only to obliterate him in the last act , just like any meaty tragedy , save the spectacle for the end . Forget that old deus ex machina today , bub . Ha , ha . For Winston Mabie 's promises meant nothing , absolutely nothing , less even than nothing , and God knew it very well .
