What if your child was so anxious she could n't go to preschool ? Or so mad she bit you and drew blood ? These moms made the wrenching decision to put their kids on powerful drugs  --  and had to make peace with the consequences Colleen Webster* never imagined she 'd need to medicate her own child . Webster , who has a master 's degree in special education , is an expert in behavior modification . Then Aaron* was born . " Early on , we knew something was n't right , " says the Charlotte , North Carolina , mom . Even as an infant , he was irritable and anxious  --  so anxious that Webster had to make sure he was the first baby to arrive at daycare every morning so the whole staff could help him adjust . By age 2 , Aaron was given to uncontrollable rages : biting , hitting , spitting . Friends told Webster that her baby 's behavior was just an extreme version of the terrible twos . It took five doctors for Aaron to get a diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no effect on Aaron 's outbursts . Webster and her husband finally agreed to try medication , but watching what the drugs did to Aaron was , she says , literally nauseating . Meds for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) made him manic and anxious : " He was cowering in my husband 's armpit . " An anticonvulsant caused hallucinations : " He would shriek that he saw bugs . " A tranquilizer made him extremely uninhibited : " He would do things like pull his pants down in public and rub his private area . " Aaron , now 6 , is currently doing well on Seroquel , an antipsychotic , and lithium , long prescribed for classic adult bipolar disease . He 's affectionate , responds appropriately to discipline , and is able to go to school in a regular classroom . " I know there are many people who believe that parents use these kinds of drugs as a quick fix , " says Webster . " But every time he has to try a new medication , I 'm a nervous wreck  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his school repeatedly to see how he 's doing . I watch him like he 's under a microscope . " But , she says , the alternative to meds is even worse : " No one knows what it 's like to have a child who bites through your skin when he does n't get what he wants , who threatens to kill you  --  and then , a minute later , comes to you with tears running down his face , so remorseful , and says , " Mommy , I want to go to sleep and never wake up . ' ' " Drugs : Lifesaving or dangerous ? Moms like Colleen Webster often feel harshly judged by other parents , who wonder how a young child could possibly need not just one but several big-gun psychiatric medications . It does n't help that the medical community is divided on the issue . Many doctors think young children now take too many dangerous drugs , the long-term effects of which are n't yet known . But others believe these are lifesaving medications for life-threatening conditions . The issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are being diagnosed with mental illness  --  ranging from bipolar disorder to more recently recognized conditions like oppositional defiant disorder  --  and being treated for them . According to one study , behavioral medications for children accounted for 17 percent of all spending for pediatric drugs , more than even antibiotics and allergy drugs . And a study in Pediatrics showed that 19 percent of all pediatric visits among 4- to 15-year-olds involve a psychosocial problem requiring attention or intervention , making such problems the most common chronic reason to consult a pediatrician . Cultural changes could explain the rising tide of pediatric prescriptions . Overcrowded classrooms can make teachers less tolerant of students who are unable to sit as still as their classmates  --  sometimes to the point of recommending that parents consider meds . Parents are more willing to consider a drug , even for their kids , because advertising by pharmaceutical companies has destigmatized the whole idea of medication . And because of the way insurance companies reimburse physicians , doctors may be more likely to prescribe drugs than therapy : " A psychiatrist who schedules four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an insurance company as he would for forty-five minutes of counseling , " says Lawrence H. Diller , M.D. , a behavioral pediatrician and the author of Should I Medicate My Child ? Many critics note that with drug-company payments to doctors on the rise , it 's not surprising that prescription writing has also increased . The New York Times found that in Minnesota ( the only state that requires doctors to report payments from drug companies ) payments to psychiatrists were six times higher in 2005 than they had been in 2000 During the same period , prescriptions for antipsychotics rose ninefold . And yet , as Demitri Papolos , M.D. , coauthor of The Bipolar Child and director of research at the Juvenile Bipolar Research Foundation in Maplewood , New Jersey , notes , " These families are constantly in crisis . Every day is heart-wrenching . " Dr. Papolos , who advocates treating kids with drugs when appropriate , says , " Early intervention makes a big difference in terms of what happens in the life of the family . " When families are in crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness . Doctors rely on their own assessment of a child 's behavior  --  and a parent 's reporting of it  --  to make the call , and sometimes arrive at a diagnosis after a single visit . When the diagnosis is n't right , or the prescribed treatment does n't work , parents end up going from doctor to doctor in hope of relief . Susan Wagner of Oklahoma City has a " bright , wonderful six-year-old son with an alphabet soup of diagnostic labels in his medical file . " Henry has been diagnosed with ADHD , NLD ( nonverbal learning disability ) , SID ( sensory integration dysfunction ) , and GAD ( general anxiety disorder ) . As an infant and toddler , he did n't interact with his parents , slept poorly , and was in constant motion , even when Wagner read him a story . " Before Henry was diagnosed , I spent a lot of time second-guessing myself and wondering if I was just imagining all these quirks , " she says . " As difficult as it was to hear that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief to me because it meant that I was not a horrible mother . " In the two years since his diagnosis , Henry has gone on to do many things his doctor said he would never do  --  such as show love and empathy for his brother , Charlie , 5 . But finding the right treatment for Henry 's array of problems remains a challenge . The Wagners have tried three different schools , occupational therapy , dietary changes , sticking to a predictable schedule  --  and , finally , medication . In one six-month period , Henry tried four different ADHD drugs ; all caused problematic side effects like insomnia and facial tics . Wagner is still looking for the right therapy , or combination of medication and therapy , to help him . " At every step of the way , I have felt simultaneously that I was doing exactly what I needed to do to help my son and that I was completely failing him , " says Wagner . Those who decide not to put their children on medication can also have a difficult time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at age 3 with ADHD , but he 's not on Ritalin . " My child 's brain is still developing , and we do n't know what these drugs will do to him . I 'm also concerned that if we start medicating him now , we will never teach him to help himself when he feels out of control , " she says . Instead , she has opted to modify Justin 's diet and treat his allergies , which seems to help somewhat , though the outbursts are far from over . " He can be defiant and violent , and when he gets into one of these episodes , there 's no reasoning with him , " says Tyson . " Keeping him from hurting himself or someone else is what we do . " The decision not to medicate has earned Tyson the disapproval of her son 's therapist and pediatrician  --  and even members of her own extended family . " It 's so isolating to know that my own family does n't understand , " she says . Though doctors recommend caution in prescribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been around long enough and studied extensively enough to be considered generally safe . " Ritalin does n't hurt anybody if used properly ; it 's just a performance enhancer . But Ritalin is candy compared to Risperdal and other antipsychotics , " says Dr. Diller . " Every few months a new danger  --  like Type 2 diabetes  --  is discovered with these drugs . " In August the Food and Drug Administration approved Risperdal to treat kids over 10 with bipolar disorder . But that does n't stop medical professionals from recommending it and other antipsychotics for little kids . Five-year-old Kendall Boger of Dover , Idaho , once received a diagnosis of a developmental disorder because of her uncontrollable rages and a recommendation for Risperdal after a short consultation with a psychologist she 'd never seen before . Her parents did n't fill it . The most controversial disorder Like Aaron Webster , Rebecca Riley was diagnosed with early-onset bipolar disorder , but she was put on three powerful medications when she was 2 . Last December Rebecca died of an overdose at her Hull , Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignited a debate over whether it was possible to diagnose bipolar disorder in younger children . ( The number of children and teenagers treated for the disorder has skyrocketed ; the most recent study estimated that the number of diagnoses went from 20,000 in 1994 to 800,000 in 2003 ) But the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry ( AACAP ) concluded that it was n't possible for kids under 6 to be diagnosed bipolar  --  and it should be a diagnosis of last resort for those under 10 . That 's why Kendall Boger now has a diagnosis of " severe mood disorder , not otherwise specified . " It is the doctor 's way of describing the symptoms of bipolar disorder without giving it the name . For the past year , Kendall has had auditory hallucinations  --  voices in her head that she calls her " fairies . " ( She once told her mom that she wanted to cut a door in her forehead to let them out . ) She also suffers from night terrors , as well as suicidal thoughts : " She tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live this life anymore , " says her mom , Claudine Boger , whose mother was also bipolar and committed suicide when Boger was 9 . The only real difference between Kendall 's illness and adult bipolar disorder is that her rages can turn on a dime into euphoria : " She does n't have an off button , " says Boger . " She 's the loudest , the most outgoing , the friendliest . She 'll lunge at other kids and hug them very tight , often scaring them to death . " In Kendall , as in other bipolar kids , these mood swings  --  between suicidal thoughts and outrageous joy  --  can happen many times in a single day . Since Kendall was 2 , the Bogers have tried an almost uncountable number of doctors and therapies  --  often traveling hundreds of miles to see specialists who are n't available in rural Idaho . " The day last December when we first agreed to try her on medication was the worst day of our lives , " says Boger . " My husband and I both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to light her on fire because she did n't want to be alive anymore . We told ourselves it was the right thing . " The side effects were horrible  --  excessive drooling , increased agitation , stomach pain , weight gain . Recently , her parents hospitalized her for a more intensive search for the right meds , and the combination of the medications and the tools she learned there seems to be working . Dr. Papolos is reluctant to apply the bipolar label to children younger than 10 , though he makes an exception for kids like Kendall , where there is a strong family history of the disorder plus suicidal thoughts and hallucinations . In such cases , he says , the danger of failing to treat the illness outweighs the danger of the medication itself . Besides the risk of laying down behavior patterns that are increasingly difficult to change as children get older , he says , even very young children are capable of harming themselves or others . Even doctors who are critical of early diagnoses acknowledge that there are young kids who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge is that medication is too often their only recourse : " The therapies that work for treating disruptive behavior disorders in kids are n't readily available , " says Jon McClellan , M.D. , an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington and the lead author of the AACAP 's report on childhood bipolar disorder . Such programs , typically found in universities or teaching hospitals , employ a one-on-one approach where parents are coached by therapists to respond in specific ways to their kids ' specific behaviors , but there 's a shortage of skilled therapists . So when parents say they 've " tried everything , " says Dr. McClellan , they probably have n't , but only because they 're unable to get the help they need . The hidden costs Beyond the literal expense of doctors and therapists and diagnostic tests and medications , the social costs of a mentally ill child can be unimaginable to someone who has never struggled with one of these conditions . Parents are frequently blamed for their child 's bad behavior . Georgeta Coleman , diagnosed with bipolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting out . When her mom , Mary Ellen , came to take Georgeta home , a school official told her that if the girl had had " better parenting , " things might have turned out differently . ( Even worse , Coleman , of Pleasant Valley , New York , then had to switch jobs because her child could n't go to school and a supervisor was n't satisfied with the partial work-from-home arrangement Coleman devised . ) Kids also face the stigma of being different . " To see the pain in my child 's eyes because she 's trying so hard to be good and " normal "  --  it rips my heart out every day , " says Claudine Boger . But for these moms , perhaps the worst feeling of all is isolation  --  the sense that family members , their child 's teachers , and even their own friends have no idea what they 're going through . " In the early days , when I felt like I was struggling the most , being told over and over that I needed to relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Wagner . And yet , despite the heartache , the expense , the sleepless nights , and feeling judged , these moms remain hopeful . " He 's my baby , " says Colleen Webster simply . " I have scars on my arms from his bites , and they will always be reminders of bad times with my son . But I also hope they will be reminders of how far we 've come . I hope someday they 'll be my badge of victory . " * 1ome names in this story have been changed .
