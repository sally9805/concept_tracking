1 From the pitched slate roof of the Royal Marsden Hospital , if you look between the chimney pots and TV aerials , you see more chimney pots and TV aerials . It 's like that scene from Mary Poppins where all the chimney sweeps dance across the rooftops twirling their brooms . From up here I can just see the dome of the Royal Albert Hall . On a clear day I could probably see all the way to Hampstead Heath , although I doubt if the air in London ever gets that clear . " This is some view , " I say , glancing to my right at a teenager crouched about ten feet away . His name is Malcolm and he 's seventeen today . Tall and thin , with dark eyes that tremble when he looks at me , he has skin as white as polished paper . He is wearing pajamas and a woolen hat to cover his baldness . Chemotherapy is a cruel hairdresser . The temperature is three degrees Celsius , but the wind chill has chased it below zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel my toes through my shoes and socks . Malcolm 's feet are bare . I wo n't reach him if he jumps or falls . Even if I stretch out and lean along the gutter , I will still be six feet short of catching him . He realizes that . He 's worked out the angles . According to his oncologist , Malcolm has an exceptional IQ . He plays the violin and speaks five languagesnone of which he 'll speak to me . For the last hour I 've been asking him questions and telling him stories . I know he can hear me , but my voice is just background noise . He 's concentrating on his own internal dialogue , debating whether he should live or die . I want to join that debate , but first I need an invitation . The National Health Service has a whole raftof guidelines for dealing with hostage situations and threatened suicides . A critical incident team has been pulled together , including senior members of staff , police and a psychologistme . The first priority has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify what has driven him to this . Doctors , nurses and patients are being interviewed , along with his friends and family . The primary negotiator is at the apex of the operational triangle . Everything filters down to me . That 's why I 'm out here , freezing my extremities off , while they 're inside drinking coffee , interviewing staff and studying flip charts . What do I know about Malcolm ? He has a primary brain tumor in the right posterior temporal region , dangerously close to his brain stem . The tumor has left him partially paralyzed down his left side and unable to hear from one ear . He is two weeks into a second course of chemotherapy . He had a visit from his parents this morning . The oncologist had good news . Malcolm 's tumor appeared to be shrinking . An hour later Malcolm wrote a two-word note that said , " I 'm sorry . " He left his room and managed to crawl onto the roof through a dormer window on the fourth floor . Someone must have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening it . There you have itthe sum total of my knowledge about a teenager who has a lot more to offer than most kids his age . I do n't know if he has a girlfriend , or a favorite football team , or a celluloid hero . I know more about his disease than I do about him . That 's why I 'm struggling . My safety harness is uncomfortable under my sweater . It looks like one of those contraptions that parents strap on to toddlers to stop them running off . In this case it 's supposed to save me if I fall , as long as someone has remembered to tie off the other end . It might sound ridiculous , but that 's the sort of detail that sometimes gets forgotten in a crisis . Perhaps I should shuffle back toward the window and ask someone to check . Would that be unprofessional ? Yes . Sensible ? Again yes . The rooftop is speckled with pigeon droppings and the slate tiles are covered in lichen and moss . The patterns look like fossilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slick and treacherous . " This probably makes no difference , Malcolm , but I think I know a little about how you 're feeling , " I say , trying once more to reach him . " I have a disease too . I 'm not saying that it 's cancer . It 's not . And trying to make comparisons is like mixing apples with oranges , but we 're still talking about fruit , right ? " The receiver in my right ear begins to crackle . " What in Christ 's name are you doing ? " says a voice . " Stop talking about fruit salad and get him inside ! " I take the earpiece out and let it dangle on my shoulder . " You know how people always say , ' It 'll be fine . Everything is going to be OK ' ? They say that because they ca n't think of anything else . I do n't know what to say either , Malcolm . I do n't even know what questions to ask . " Most people do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no book of etiquette or list of dos and don'ts . You either get the watery-eyed , **32;192;TOOLONG look or forced jokiness and buck-up speeches . The other option is complete denial . " Malcolm has n't responded . He 's staring across the rooftops as if looking out of a tiny window high up in the gray sky . His pajamas are thin and white with blue stitching around the cuffs and collar . Between my knees I can see three fire engines , two ambulances and half a dozen police cars . One of the fire engines has an extension ladder on a turntable . I have n't taken much notice of it until now , but I see it slowly turning and begin to slide upward . Why would they be doing that ? At the same moment , Malcolm braces his back against the sloping roof and lifts himself . He squats on the edge , with his toes hanging over the gutter , like a bird perched on a branch . I can hear someone screaming and then I realize that it 's me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly gesticulating for them to get the ladder away . I look like the suicidal jumper and Malcolm looks totally calm . I fumble for the earpiece and hear pandemonium inside . The critical incident team is shouting at the chief fire officer , who is shouting at his second-in-command , who is shouting at someone else . " Do n't do it , Malcolm ! Wait ! " I sound desperate . " Look at the ladder . It 's going down . See ? It 's going down . " Blood is pounding in my ears . He stays perched on the edge , curling and uncurling his toes . In profile I can see his long dark lashes blinking slowly . His heart is beating like a bird 's within his narrow chest . " You see that fireman down there with the red helmet ? " I say , trying to break into his thoughts . " The one with all the brass buttons on his shoulders . What do you think my chances are of spitting on his helmet from here ? " For the briefest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time he 's acknowledged anything I 've said or done . The door has opened a crack . " Some people like to spit watermelon seeds or cherry pits . In Africa they spit dung , which is pretty gross . I read somewhere that the world record for spitting Kudu dung is about thirty feet . I think Kudu is a kind of antelope but do n't quote me on that . I prefer good old-fashioned saliva and it 's not about distance ; it 's about accuracy . " He 's looking at me now . With a snap of my head I send a foaming white ball arcing downward . It gets picked up by the breeze and drifts to the right , hitting the windshield of a police car . In silence I contemplate the shot , trying to work out where I went wrong . " You did n't allow for the wind , " Malcolm says . I nod sagely , barely acknowledging him , but inside I have a warm glow in a part of me that is n't yet frozen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wind tunnel . " " You 're making excuses . " " I have n't seen you try . " He looks down , considering this . He 's hugging his knees as if trying to stay warm . It 's a good sign . A moment later a globule of spit curves outward and falls . Together we watch it descend , almost willing it to stay on course . It hits a TV reporter squarely between the eyes and Malcolm and I groan in harmony . My next shot lands harmlessly on the front steps . Malcolm asks if he can change the target . He wants to hit the TV reporter again . " Shame we do n't have any water bombs , " he says , resting his chin on one knee . " If you could drop a water bomb on anyone in the world , who would it be ? " " My parents . " " Why ? " " I do n't want to have chemo again . I 've had enough . " He does n't elaborate . It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects than chemotherapy . The vomiting , nausea , constipation , anemia and overwhelming fatigue can be intolerable . " What does your oncologist say ? " " He says the tumor is shrinking . " " That 's good . " He laughs wryly . " They said that last time . The truth is they 're just chasing cancer all around my body . It does n't go away . It just finds somewhere else to hide . They never talk about a cure ; they talk about remission . Sometimes they do n't talk to me at all . They just whisper to my parents . " He bites his bottom lip and a carmine mark appears where the blood rushes to the indentation . " Mum and Dad think I 'm scared of dying , but I 'm not scared . You should see some of the kids in this place . At least I 've had a life . Another fifty years would be nice , but like I said , I 'm not scared . " " How many more chemo sessions ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind losing my hair . A lot of footballers shave their hair off . Look at David Beckham ; he 's a wanker , but he 's a wicked player . Having no eyebrows is a bit of a blow . " " I hear Beckham gets his plucked . " " By Posh ? " " Yeah . " It almost raises a smile . In the silence I can hear Malcolm 's teeth chattering . " If the chemo does n't work my parents are going to tell the doctors to keep trying . They 'll never let me go . " " You 're old enough to make your own decisions . " " Try telling them that . " " I will if you want me to . " He shakes his head and I see the tears starting to form . He tries to stop them , but they squeeze out from under his long lashes in fat drops that he wipes away with his forearm . " Is there someone you can talk to ? " " I like one of the nurses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is she your girlfriend ? " He blushes . The paleness of his skin makes it look as though his head is filling with blood . " Why do n't you come inside and we 'll talk some more ? I ca n't raise another spit unless I get something to drink . " He does n't answer , but I see his shoulders sag . He 's listening to that internal dialogue again . " I have a daughter called Charlie who is eight years old , " I say , trying to hold him . " I remember when she was about four , we were in the park and I was pushing her on a swing . She said to me , ' Daddy , do you know that if you close your eyes really tightly , so you see white stars , when you open them again it 's a brand-new world ? ' It 's a nice thought , is n't it ? " " But it 's not true . " " It can be . " " Only if you pretend . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easy to be cynical and pessimistic , but it 's incredibly hard work . It 's much easier to be hopeful . " " I have an inoperable brain tumor , " he says incredulously . " Yes , I know . " I wonder if my words sound as hollow to Malcolm as they do to me . I used to believe all this stuff . A lot can change in ten days . Malcolm interrupts me . " Are you a doctor ? " " A psychologist . " " Tell me again why should I come down ? " " Because it 's cold and it 's dangerous and I 've seen what people look like when they fall from buildings . Come inside . Let 's get warm . " He glances below at the carnival of ambulances , fire engines , police cars and media vans . " I won the spitting contest . " " Yes you did . " " You 'll talk to Mum and Dad ? " " Absolutely . " He tries to stand , but his legs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes his arm next to useless . He needs two arms to get up . " Just stay there . I 'll get them to send up the ladder . " " No ! " he says urgently . I see the look on his face . He does n't want to be brought down in the blaze of TV lights , with reporters asking questions . " OK . I 'll come to you . " I 'm amazed at how brave that sounds . I start to slide sideways in a bum shuffletoo frightened to stand . I have n't forgotten about the safety harness , but I 'm still convinced that nobody has bothered to tie it off . As I edge along the gutter , my head fills with images of what could go wrong . If this were a Hollywood movie Malcolm would slip at the last moment and I 'd dive and pluck him out of midair . Either that or I 'd fall and he 'd rescue me . On the other handbecause this is real lifewe might both perish , or Malcolm could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his death . Although he has n't moved , I can see a new emotion in his eyes . A few minutes ago he was ready to step off the roof without a moment 's hesitation . Now he wants to live and the void beneath his feet has become an abyss . The American philosopher William James ( a closet phobic ) wrote an article in 1884 pondering the nature of fear . He used an example of a person encountering a bear . Does he run because he feels afraid , or does he feel afraid after he has already started running ? In other words , does a person have time to think something is frightening , or does the reaction precede the thought ? Ever since then scientists and psychologists have been locked in a kind of chicken-and-egg debate . What comes firstthe conscious awareness of fear or the pounding heart and surging adrenaline that motivates us to fight or flight ? I know the answer now , but I 'm so frightened I 've forgotten the question . I 'm only a few feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's stopped shivering . Pressing my back against the wall , I push one leg beneath me and lever my body upward until I 'm standing . Malcolm looks at my outstretched hand for a moment and then reaches slowly toward me . I grab him by the wrist and pull him upward until my arm slips around his thin waist . His skin feels like ice . The front of the safety harness unclasps and I can lengthen the straps . I pass them around his waist and back through the buckle , until the two of us are tethered together . His woolen hat feels rough against my cheek . " What do you want me to do ? " he asks , in a croaky voice . " You can pray the other end of this is tied on to something . "
