Section : On the Cover 200 Best Small Companies Bob Stiller 's long-shot bets have turned Green Mountain Coffee Roasters into one of the smartest small companies in America <p> Do n't let his look of blissful relaxation fool you . Robert Stiller 's head is constantly boiling with new ideas , many of them at odds with those of almost everyone around him . Some of the ideas lose money . Every now and then one makes a bundle . <p> Stiller 's first big hit was selling rolling paper on the drug-sodden campus of Columbia University in the early 1970s . His brand , E-Z Wider ( a little jab at the cult film ) , had double the width of competing brands . The paper would n't feed into the machine properly , causing tearing . It was scientifically processed ; Stiller discovered that storing a bobbin of paper for three weeks in a humidified room prevented the raw material from ripping . " People expected to see potheads , but we were more efficient at paper conversion than any manufacturer at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million before Stiller and a partner sold out in 1980 , each pocketing $3.1 million . <p> Twenty years later he still has a knack for experimentation  --  in the humble business of selling coffee beans . Founder and chief executive of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters , 58-year-old Stiller is constantly trying out new technologies , backing other entrepreneurs with untested ideas and taking risks with suppliers that , on the face of it , appear slightly crazy . " Bob has that sense of not what is , but what could be , " says Nick G. Lazaris , chief executive of Keurig , which makes coffee-brewing machines and is a partner of Green Mountain . <p> The road less traveled is strewn with riches . Green Mountain ranks 16th on the Forbes 200 Best Small Companies ranking , its second year on the list . Sales have grown an average 24% over the last five years to $84 million for the year ended Sept. 30 , 2000 ; earnings per share have been growing at 43% . In the quarter ended July 7 , net income rose 67% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , outperforming those of both Starbucks and a closer rival , Peet 's Coffee &; Tea . Stiller 's 48.5% stake is worth $89 million . <p> Green Mountain has put down deep roots near its headquarters in bucolic Waterbury , Vt . Three of every 10 pounds of roasted beans are sold in Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont . But this is a national company , deriving 95% of its revenue from 6,700 wholesale customers that include convenience stores , gas stations , supermarkets , offices and restaurants . <p> A born tinkerer , Stiller spent weekends and holidays during his youth toiling at Stillman Manufacturing , his dad 's Bronx , N.Y . company that made one of the first tubular heating coils for electric stoves . While still in high school , Stiller designed one machine that handled milling , cleaning and threading of a heating element . College was a chore ; he could n't maintain a C average  --  or what the college called a proper attitude  --  to remain at Syracuse University and ended up with a degree in business from Parsons College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia as a data-processing manager . <p> After cashing out of the rolling paper business , Stiller found himself at his ski condo in Sugarbush , Vt. wondering what to do next . One night , as he enjoyed a rare cup of coffee at a restaurant , he woke up and smelled the opportunity . A couple of days later he visited the small roaster in Waitsfield , Vt. , where the restaurant bought its beans . For the next few months he roasted his own beans , using a hot-air popcorn popper at one point , a cookie sheet at another , brewing batches of coffee for friends . Stiller ended up buying the Waitsfield store with a partner and giving the store owner an equal one-third stake in Green Mountain . Within two years he became the sole proprietor , buying out both partners for $100,000 . <p> The business seemed doomed from the start . Holed up in an office over a movie theater , Stiller lent the company $1 million , but still had to pay salaries with credit cards . His $30,000 line of credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the bank in search of more money . What loan officer dared believe in this venture ? This was a decade before Starbucks reached the East Coast , and a cup of joe was just something to wash down the morning eggs and toast . Stiller added retail stores in Vermont and Maine , and insisted on roasting only arabica beans , grown at higher altitudes and pricier than the robusta variety . Unable to afford advertising , he gave away samples at wine and food festivals and to organizations like the Cub Scouts and Ronald McDonald House . The red ink flowed , $1.4 million cumulatively from 1981 to 1985 . <p> Always on the prowl for new customers , Stiller began selling to high-end restaurants and specialty stores . He bought a personal computer and hired a programmer to write software that traced customers ' orders , deliveries and payments . Ever since , he has invested heavily in technology , becoming one of the first customers of Praxis , which developed a program to monitor and adjust heat levels in the roasters appropriate to each bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to great coffee , " says Stiller . " I do n't care how artistic you are , there are too many factors in play . You need the technology . " <p> Which is why the fellow with the tube-bending machine and the rolling-paper process has installed $2.5 million worth of software from PeopleSoft to track distribution , manufacturing , sales and personnel . At the time this software project got under way Green Mountain had only $33 million in sales and was PeopleSoft 's smallest customer for the product . " Green Mountain , " says Michael Frandsen , PeopleSoft 's general manager of supply chain management , " is one of the most aggressive small companies I 've come across . " <p> As when Stiller ignored the grumbling of some board members over selling his premium coffee to grungy gas stations . He thought it was a good way to spread the brand ; the trick was to make sure the coffee at ExxonMobil was brewed as carefully as it was at New York 's Harvard Club . So along with its beans , Green Mountain bundled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banners and training . Stiller created one- and two-day courses for customers with instruction about coffee farming , grinding and filtering . Now ExxonMobil is its biggest customer , representing 17%of sales last year . Last November Green Mountain signed a five-year agreement , beating out 11 rivals , to supply all 1,100 ExxonMobil company-owned stores and 500 franchise locations . <p> Another long-shot bet : backing three unknown entrepreneurs peddling a single-serve coffee system . At the time , they held the patent on filter-wrapped individual portions of ground coffee , but had no product ready for market . Stiller invested $150,000 for a 1% stake in Keurig . Green Mountain patiently worked with them on product quality and flavor . Finally , in 1998 , the Keurig machine rolled into offices like PricewaterhouseCoopers . Green Moun-tain , which produces K-Cup individual packages of coffee at its factory , pays Keurig an undisclosed royalty based on the number of packages it sells . Last year K-Cups contributed 15.7% of Green Mountain 's revenues . <p> Leaning forward so often , Stiller has occasionally fallen off his perch . Anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could n't meet Nasdaq listing guidelines and traded for four years on Nasdaq 's minor league system ( called the Nasdaq SmallCap Market ) . With the $11.5 million raised , he invested in mail-order catalogs , opened five retail stores and hired a bunch ofseasoned outsiders . He also spent $500,000 on packaging equipment that flushes out the oxygen with puffs of nitrogen to improve shelf life . <p> Stiller wanted to invest now in anticipation of future growth . Such improvements had a cost . The company lost a combined $4.7 million in fiscal 1993 and 1994 . For ten months Stiller stopped matching contributions to the 401(k) program , and imposed a hiring freeze . The bigger growth lay with the wholesale business . Green Mountain shuttered its 12 stores in 1998 , at a cost of $1.3 million . <p> Vermont being Vermont , it goes without saying that Green Mountain strives for a do-gooder image , giving away 5% of pretax profits to " socially responsible " causes . " I 'm not doing it because I want to give money away to charities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most business sense . " Example : providing startup funding for 100 small-scale farmers who formed a cooperative in Sumatra , Indonesia . Since then , production has increased almost sixfold  --  18% of its arabica going to Green Mountain . Stiller was one of the early backers of " fair trade " coffee , which pays farmers what they need to break even and clear a small profit . All this draws customers like Columbia University and natural food stores . <p> Stiller has gradually backed away from the day-to-day business , acting more as teacher than taskmaster . He meditates 45 minutes every day and , despite enduring the occasional pair of rolling eyes , nudges his staff to study " appreciative inquiry , " a management technique developed at Case Western Reserve University that encourages people to learn from their successes  --  what produced a great batch of roasted beans , for instance , or the last deal that closed  --  instead of their mistakes . <p> Is this still a growth company ? Probably not the one it used to be . The Delta Shuttle will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kraft , is muscling into the grocery-store channel . Stiller predicts sales growth will be 15% to 20% next year , below its five-year average . But he 's still a risk-taker . He is spending $2 million for a couple of roasters , which will boost capacity from 15 million pounds to 40 million pounds a year . It will be a long time before demand catches up . But Stiller is sure that day will come .
