Becka knew she was going to drown . Gasping , she filled her lungs as another massive wave forced her below the churning turquoise waters . As she plunged downward , all sound ceased , except her heartbeat pounding in her ears . The saltwater irritated her eyes . The light dimmed . Her muscles ached and her lungs burned as she sank lower . Despite the pain , she kicked and thrashed . Bubbles ringed her body like a halo . Becka 's headache , which had tormented her for the last few days , throbbed in steady time with her pulse . She 'd spent the last two weeks with very little food or water . Now exhaustion , dehydration , and hunger were taking their toll on her . <p> She should have never applied for Castaways . Watching it on TV every week was very different from actually competing in the show . Watching it did n't require pain or sacrifice or pushing your body to its limits . <p> What was she doing here , drowning in the waters off an uninhabited South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the million-dollar prize worth all this ? It was insane . She could n't do this . She 'd applied on a whim , never believing she 'd actually make the final cut . She 'd filled out the online application , but so had a million and a half other people . There was no way she should have been picked . Yet here she was , one of the twenty who 'd been selected-a twenty-two-year-old Penn State graduate who still lived with her parents because she could n't find a job . A month ago , she 'd been at home , attending employment fairs and desperately trying to find herself . Find anything . Now she was here , in the most beautiful place she 'd ever seen , and Becka was so tired and demoralized that she could n't even enjoy it . <p> She was tempted to just close her eyes , exhale , and slowly drift to the bottom of the sea . The other people on the island craved fame or notoriety or wealth . Let them have it . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if it was just a whim . Otherwise she would n't be here . Now all Becka wanted was oblivion-the blessed bliss of unconsciousness . The smothering kiss of death . A very long sleep . <p> The water felt like a blanket , snuggly and comforting . <p> Becka closed her eyes and let the blanket engulf her . <p> ... sleep . <p> No , fuck that . <p> Her depressed futility gave way to a sense of frustration and competitiveness . Screw it . She had n't come all this way just to give up now . She was in this to win . No matter how much she hurt , there was no retreat , no surrender . Not yet . Her family and some of her friends would understand if she quit , but they were n't the only people Becka had to worry about . There were others-the countless , faceless millions on the Internet , eager to log on and share their opinions and critiques on countless trivial pop culture icons , including her . A month ago , she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blog . After this aired , her face and name would be recognized by everyone in America who owned a television or read the newspapers . She was a reality television star-or would be , once this aired . <p> In just a short time , Becka had learned what other public figures before her had known , as well-fame or infamy ( because the two were often synonymous ) sucked in equal measure . You craved them until you got them , and then you did n't want them anymore . <p> And she did n't even have them yet . <p> But there was no going back . <p> Spurred by anger , Becka gritted her teeth and kicked hard for the surface . A vibrant rainbow of tropical fish darted around her , chased by a grayish white sea snake with prominent dark bands encircling its body . Becka paused . Eyeing the serpent 's paddle-shaped tail , she tried to remember if this particular type of sea snake was venomous . Before her arrival , she 'd studied the Pacific Islands as best she could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could n't recall whether this one was poisonous . Becka gave the sea snake a wide berth , just to be safe . Ignoring her , the serpent continued pursuing the fish . A stingray glided by , oblivious to both Becka and the other marine life , or perhaps indifferent . She stared at it , carefully avoiding the barbed tail . <p> The aching in her oxygen-starved lungs grew stronger . Above her , Becka saw the wiggling legs of the other castaways . She swam toward them . Her head broke the surface . Coughing , she spat saltwater and gasped for air . Her throat was sore . The sun was blinding . Waves buffeted her about . Another big one almost sank her , but she fought to stay afloat . Blinking the water from her eyes , she glanced around . <p> A television camera stared back at her . <p> Ignore it , she thought . It does n't exist . Remember that . I 'm supposed to pretend it is n't there . <p> Becka treaded water next to a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound engineer , a field producer , and a pilot-all network employees . As Becka coughed , they merely glanced at her , impassive . They did n't speak or even nod in acknowledgment . Becka drifted away from the craft , debating whether she should break the rules and ask for assistance . Contestants were n't supposed to talk to or interact with the crew unless it was a dire emergency-or unless the crew initiated the contact . <p> " Think they 'll give us a ride ? " <p> Jerry treaded water beside her , droplets rolling off his shaved head and chest . Like Becka , he was in his early twenties and in impressive physical shape . He was cute , and she 'd noticed him checking her out several times since they 'd arrived on the island two weeks ago . She did n't know much about him-just that he owned a video store in Santa Monica , California . Under different circumstances , Becka might have considered getting to know him better , but there was no time for that out here . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong person or trusting someone just a little too much led to disaster . After twelve seasons of Castaways , even a novice knew that . <p> " Give us a ride ? " She struggled to catch her breath . " You know the rules . Initiating contact with the crew means immediate disqualification from the- " <p> Jerry held his hands up . " I know , I know . Jesus , Becka , I was just kidding . " <p> Another wave crashed over them . Becka fought to keep from swallowing more water . This wave was smaller than the last , and she managed to stay afloat . The two of them bobbed up on its crest and then back down again as it rolled past . <p> Three times a week , Becka and the other castaways had to compete against one another in a series of contests and challenges . Sometimes they were physical . Other times the puzzles focused on intelligence and wits , or trivia based on the region where the current game was being played . The winner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was safe until the next challenge . The other castaways would then select someone to exile-meaning the chosen person was ejected from the game . Any contestant was eligible for exile , with the exception of whoever had won the circle of protection . <p> For today 's challenge , they 'd been brought offshore by boat and then told that they had to race to shore . Now that Becka had surfaced , the other castaways were swimming away again , leaving just her , Jerry , and the camera crew on the small boat . <p> Becka frowned . " Should n't you be trying to finish the race ? " <p> " It does n't matter now . " Jerry shrugged . " Stefan already won this round . " <p> " Shit . " <p> " Yeah . Pompous Brit bastard . Jeff and Richard were right on his ass the whole way . All three made it to shore at the same time , but Stefan crossed the finish line first . He 's got his place in the circle of protection now , so somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who ? " <p> " I do n't know . Any ideas who you 'd like to see gone ? " <p> Becka 's response was cut off by another bout of coughing . <p> " You okay ? " <p> Jerry sounded genuinely concerned . Becka eyed him carefully . <p> " I do n't like the water . " <p> She immediately regretted revealing her weakness to him . Now , if he wanted to , Jerry could exploit it to advance his own standing in the game . <p> " This ? " He grinned , dog-paddling . " This is nothing . Just some minor swells . " <p> " I thought there was a storm coming . That 's what one of the crew-Mark , the guy with the mullet-said earlier . " <p> " Maybe . " Jerry glanced up at the sky . " But the sun is out and there ai n't a cloud in the sky . These are n't storm waves . The sea is choppy , sure , but it 's nothing to worry about . I surf waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hang on to me and I 'll get us both to shore . " <p> " I 'll be okay . It 's just ... I had a bad experience in a swimming pool when I was little . My brother pushed me in the deep end when I was like four years old . The water scares me a little bit , but I 'll make it . " <p> The boat 's engine throttled up , and the small craft raced ahead . The camera crew 's lenses were now trained on Pauline and Roberta . Coughing , Becka watched the two women swimming toward shore and felt a twinge of jealousy . Even Roberta , a middle-aged librarian , was doing better than she was . <p> " Come on , " Jerry insisted . " Let me give you a lift . " <p> Becka hesitated , still not trusting him . <p> Jerry 's grin vanished . " Look , that million dollars is n't going to do you much good if you drown before reaching the island . You 're coughing and hacking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over , anyway . Stefan already won . " <p> " Yeah , " she said . " I guess . " <p> He held out his arm . Becka paused , then took it . His muscles were hard as stone beneath his slippery skin . She shivered and felt a warmness in her belly . If Jerry noticed , he did n't comment on it . Instead , he propelled them forward with strong , confident strokes . They rose and fell on the crests of the waves . Seabirds circled overhead , riding the breeze and squawking incessantly . <p> The boat slowed , engine idling softly , as it reached Roberta and Pauline . The two women were quite a pair . Roberta , fifty-four , was a librarian at the Ulster County Community College in Poughkeepsie , New York . Pauline , forty-one , was a dancer , model , and former NFL cheerleader from Tampa . Roberta was kind , soft-spoken , and sedate . Pauline was gregarious , manic , and possibly the biggest airhead on the planet-at least , that was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two had formed an alliance within their first day on the island . They swam next to Troy , a skinny , tattooed , foul-mouthed auto mechanic from Seattle . <p> Jerry did n't speak as he guided them toward the beach . <p> " Are you okay ? " Becka asked . " Am I too heavy ? " <p> " No , you 're fine . Light as a feather . " <p> She blushed . " That 's because we 've had nothing to eat at base camp except rice and fish for the last five days . " <p> " Yeah , " Jerry agreed . " Lucky for us that Raul and Ryan have been so good at catching fish . " <p> " Lucky for them , too . Keeps them from getting exiled . " <p> " Even so , I 'd kill for a pizza right about now . " <p> Becka started to pull away from him . " I think I 'm okay now . I 've got my breath back , and I do n't feel like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , maybe you 'd better hold on to me a little longer , just to be safe . You can let go when we reach the boat . That way , they do n't capture this on camera . Would n't want your boyfriend back home to see this when it airs and get jealous . " <p> " I do n't have a boyfriend . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " You sound surprised . " <p> " I am , " he admitted . " I figured you 'd be fighting guys off with a stick . " <p> Becka blushed again . Before she could respond , they neared the camera boat . One of the crew members had noticed their approach and was beginning to swing the camera back around on them . Becka felt a twinge of regret as she let go of Jerry 's arm and began to swim on her own . They drew alongside Roberta , Pauline , and Troy . The rest of the castaways were already on the beach . <p> " Hey . " Roberta waved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " We saw , " Jerry said . " Which sort of screws up our whole plan . Anyone have any ideas on who to exile from the island instead ? " <p> " We were talking about Jeff , " Roberta said . " Thoughts ? " <p> Jerry nodded . " Good choice . He 's physically fit , and kicking ass in the challenges . He 's definitely a threat . " <p> " But he 's so nice , " Pauline said , treading water . " Ca n't we pick someone else ? I hate voting to exile the nice guys . " <p> The cameraman leaned over the side of the boat , focusing on their conversation . <p> " Nice ? " Troy smirked . " You mean you think he 's hot . Ai n't that right ? " <p> Pauline shrugged . " Sure . What 's wrong with that ? " <p> " Nothing , " Troy said , " except that Jeff 's got you and every other chick on this fucking island not voting to exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do n't forget Ryan , " Becka teased . " He thinks Jeff 's pretty cute , too . " <p> Troy poked his cheek out with his tongue and mimed fellatio . <p> Jerry rolled his eyes . " With your sparkling personality , Troy , I bet you never get exiled . " <p> " Fuck you , baldy . " <p> " Great retort , tough guy . " <p> Scowling , Troy swam ahead of them , muttering a string of curses that grew louder when a strong wave knocked his battered Seahawks cap off his head . Arms flailing , he surged after it . The hat drifted back to Pauline , who plucked it from the water and waved it over her head . Her breasts bounced up and down as she did , and the camera zoomed in on them . <p> Becka frowned , noticing the leering expression on the crew 's faces . No doubt this footage would make it through the editing process and end up on the air . <p> Pauline held the hat out to Troy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Laughing , she jerked the hat back and swam away . <p> " Hey , " Troy shouted . " You 're playing with your fucking life , sweetheart ! " <p> He chased after Pauline , and the camera crew followed them , forgetting about the others to remain focused on Pauline 's attributes . Somehow her ass stayed above the surface as she swam , and her thong bikini , threadbare from all this time spent outdoors , left little to the imagination . It certainly kept the interest of the four men on the boat . Becka was certain that Pauline was aware of it . So far , her strategy for winning had been to use her sexuality-flirting with the men and playing the helpless damsel in distress , or worse , sucking up to the other women when the men were n't around . <p> " She 's certainly got no problem staying afloat , " Becka said . " Wonder how much she paid for those things ? " <p> Jerry laughed . " Remember , all of America might hear you say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The camera crew went chasing off after her . " <p> But even if they did n't hear me , Becka thought , Roberta did . She and Pauline are pretty tight . If she tells Pauline what I said , and Pauline gets offended , it could be me who gets exiled tonight . Shit ! What was I thinking ? <p> Roberta swam ahead . Frowning , Jerry watched her go . Becka noticed the worried lines on his face . <p> " What 's wrong ? " <p> " We may have just screwed up really bad . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Pauline and Roberta are part of Stefan 's clique . So is Jeff . And we just told them we thought Jeff was a threat and that maybe we should vote to exile him tonight . " <p> " Yes , but they were the ones who brought him up in the first place . " <p> " True . But why ? Why would they do that , unless maybe they were testing us ? Find out our plans and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Shit . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> A helicopter roared overhead , filming aerial footage of the race . Becka watched it swoop toward land . Over the last two weeks , she 'd come to hate the island , but despite the treacherous living conditions , she was still impressed and awed by its beauty . It loomed before them , a foreboding but picturesque mass of rocky hills , dark forest and thick jungle . Towering volcanic mountains descended into blue-green bays and white sandy beaches covered with seashells . Far above the mountain peaks were a few thin clouds , but otherwise the sky was clear . If there was a storm on the way , as Becka had been told , then it was still a long way off . <p> They swam for shore and caught up with Roberta . Becka continued staring at the island . Jerry and Roberta followed her gaze . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
