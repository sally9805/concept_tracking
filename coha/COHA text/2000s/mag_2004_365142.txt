Is there anything Botox ca n't do ? The FDA last week approved the anti-wrinkle wonder drug for yet another use : drying out supersweaty armpits ( a condition known as hyperhidrosis ) . In a trial of 322 patients , better than 80% cut their sweating by more than half  --  and these are folks who can sweat through a business suit in minutes . One treatment , which lasts six months , will cost $750 . This brings to five the number of FDA-sanctioned uses for Botox . Can a cure for baldness be far behind ?
