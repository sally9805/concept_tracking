Give David E. Kelley credit for one thing : he 's the one male producer in Hollywood not willing to cede gender issues to women . Judging by girls club ( Fox , Mondays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) , his **28;15431;TOOLONG follow-up to his **27;15461;TOOLONG serial Ally McBeal ( canceled last season ) , we will have to pry gender issues from his cold , dead fingers . <P> As on Ally , the focus is on matters professional and romantic  --  here , about new attorneys Lynne ( Gretchen Mol ) , Jeannie ( Kathleen Robertson ) and Sarah ( Chyler Leigh ) . As on Ally , we see a high-priced law firm , eccentric cases and characters with nicknames like " the Worm . " But do n't think Kelley is only out to cannibalize Ally . He 's also out to give feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon a heart attack . Why else open the pilot with Lynne rehearsing opening arguments in the middle of the night in her skimpy jammies ? Or run opening credits while the friends jog , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a pillow fight ? Reese Witherspoon was more credible in Legally Blonde . <P> O.K. , we get it : girls club ( it 's lowercase , so it 's art ! ) says that feminism today is about both power and femininity . So does The Powerpuff Girls , but it 's easier to walk the line between girl-positive feminism and silliness with little-girl superheroes than with grownup lawyers dressed like Britney Spears circa 1999 . More problematic , girls club is so self-consciously about , y'know , women 's stuff that almost every story defines the characters in terms of gender : Jeannie gets sexually harassed , Lynne is accused of infatuation with a male client , Sarah blurts out an anti-lesbian slur . Lest you miss the X chromosomity of it all , Jeannie even sues on behalf of a woman whose ob-gyn passes out face first into her during an exam . <P> Throw as many darts as Kelley does , and you will occasionally hit a target . The show is sharpest when it looks at the rift between young women and ERA-era feminists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a.k.a. " the Praying Mantis . " " What chance does feminism have in this sweat hole when the strong women become like the men ? " Lynne asks , referring to her older , Type A colleague . Meredith is a harpy who spits her lines like Cruella De Vil , though she hints that she 's more complicated . There 's the kernel of an interesting story here , about young women who are just starting out and have some growing up to do . Too bad Kelley ca n't make the same excuse .  --  By James Poniewozik
