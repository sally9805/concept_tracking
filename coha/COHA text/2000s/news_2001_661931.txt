EDITOR 'S NOTE - This is Part 3 of a five-day serial portraying courage in wildfire 's way . By DAVID FOSTER Associated Press Writer <p> CONCOW , Calif . ( AP ) - It is 2 a.m. , and someone is banging on Ray McCarty 's doublewide mobile home . Rousing himself from bed , he finds a firefighter at his door . <p> The wind has changed , Capt . Darryl Sanford tells McCarty and his son , Richard . The wildfire that more than 1,000 firefighters have battled all day is heading this way . <p> Better pack a few things and be ready to leave , Sanford says . Then he points south , toward a house across the pasture . Anyone at home over there ? he asks . <p> " That 's my landlady , Beverly Brooks , " McCarty replies and volunteers to alert her . <p> As Sanford 's truck rumbles away , McCarty tries the telephone . It 's dead . He drives his pickup over to Brooks ' house , where he bangs on the door and calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chihuahuas . <p> He peers in through the screen door . A living room lamp throws light down the hallway to the right . McCarty can see Brooks lying on her bed in a room at the end of the hall . <p> " Beverly ? Beverly ! " <p> She stirs but does n't awaken , and McCarty decides to let the poor woman be . He 'd visited with her a few hours ago , calming her fears by repeating what everyone else was saying : The fire was heading away from them , toward the northeast . <p> Let her sleep , McCarty figures . If the fire gets close , he 'll come back . There will be time enough . He heads home , grabs the garden hose and starts wetting down brush around the yard . <p> Parked on Stagecoach Lane near McCarty 's house , Capt . Jeff Hawkins keeps watch with his two firefighters , Joe Saunders and Paul Carlos . <p> Behind the hill to the north , wildfire is ripping across the countryside , devouring houses , trees , cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stars are sparkling . There 's no smoke , nor even an orange glow , over the wooded ridge . <p> To Hawkins , the 40-acre pasture between Brooks ' and McCarty 's homes seems much safer than the manzanita thickets he 's seen all day . The field is full of star thistle , 3 feet high and as dry as hay . It burns like gasoline , but any firefighter prefers it to the sustained fire you get in dense brush and timber . <p> McCarty 's mobile home , on the other hand , is tucked back into higher brush and brambles at the pasture 's northern edge . Junk is scattered about the yard . <p> Hawkins sees this kind of thing all the time . People move to the country and want to live amid the trees , not out in the open . They bring their toys , then build sheds and garages to hold everything , but there 's never enough room , so yards fill with boats , kennels , old cars and stacks of lumber . <p> Such clutter is maddening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its potential to burn . They lump all houses into two simple categories : losers and keepers . <p> Is brush cleared at least 30 feet out from the house ? Are gutters clean of leaves ? Is the yard free of flammable junk and firewood ? Are the walls and roof made of fire-resistant materials ? If so , the house may be a keeper . <p> As for McCarty 's house - a definite loser , Hawkins thinks . <p> " If this thing goes , we 're not setting up here , " he tells his firefighters . " It would be nothing but trouble . " <p> Around 2:20 a.m. , the stars begin to vanish . <p> Smoke is curling over the ridge . Glowing embers sail out of the darkness and land in the star thistle . At first , the weeds do n't ignite , and Hawkins sighs in relief . <p> Now comes a gust of wind , another volley of firebrands . They land like tiny bombs , and this time the thistle catches fire . <p> " OK , boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Already facing out toward Nelson Bar Road , Hawkins drives the engine 50 yards forward , to the edge of a spot fire . In the minute it takes his firefighters to charge the hose and start spraying , the fire has spread too much to stop . Other spot fires are breaking out all over the pasture . <p> Hawkins pulls up a few yards , hoses dragging behind the engine , but the fire quickly catches up to them . <p> " Cut the hoses and get in , " Hawkins shouts . Saunders and Carlos pile in , and Hawkins speeds the truck along Stagecoach Lane , away from McCarty 's house and toward Nelson Bar Road . In his rearview mirrors , Hawkins sees only orange . <p> They pull ahead of the fire and look back toward the mobile home . Flames are licking at the house . Brush is burning along both sides of Stagecoach Lane , and McCarty and his son are running around the front yard , trying to get a half-dozen dogs into two trucks . <p> " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what he has to do , but he polls his firefighters anyway : Should we get them ? <p> Absolutely , both reply . <p> The engine roars back up McCarty 's drive , plunging into a cloud of choking smoke . As Hawkins turns the engine around , Carlos and Saunders get out to retrieve the McCartys . <p> Hawkins is not one for macho pretense . He figures any firefighter who claims never to get scared is either crazy or a liar . Fear sharpens the senses . But now , with **29;5391;TOOLONG thoughts running through his mind , Hawkins is edging toward the line that separates healthy fear from mindless panic . <p> It appears McCarty and his son have already crossed it . They 're still trying to round up their hunting hounds , and not making much progress . Flames swirl around the fire engine , and Hawkins ca n't sit still . He twists in the driver 's seat and yells out the window . <p> " Get them in here ! We got ta go ! " <p> The McCartys resist . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to drive out themselves . But Hawkins is adamant : It 's too late for that . All sweat and smoke , father and son tumble into the fire engine 's cab , carrying one favored hound named Bones . <p> The doors slam shut and Hawkins hits the accelerator . Behind him , Ray and Richard McCarty sit silently , staring out at flames churning up from the blackberries . <p> With the windows closed , they hear no more of the fire outside : not the roar of the flames , not the crackling brambles , not the desperate howls of the dogs left behind . <p> Norm Williams jolts awake . Someone 's pounding on the wall of his mobile home . <p> " Your house is on fire ! " he hears a voice shouting . <p> " Then put the son of a bitch out ! " he yells back . <p> He and Lesta spring out of bed , make it to the door . Williams shakes . His wife begins to cry . <p> That fool firefighter got it wrong , Williams thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Flames are in the woods across Nelson Bar Road , right up to the pavement . <p> " Listen , " Williams says . " What we got ta do is keep our heads on our shoulders . " <p> They 're in good shape to make it out of this , he figures . Fire trucks line the road . And the Williamses know the tricks of surviving in wildfire country . They water their lawn , mow weeds in the field and trim branches on trees near the house , which has metal siding and a fire-resistant composition roof . <p> Williams tells his wife to get the family photos and financial records she 'd gathered up earlier and throw them in the truck . He 'll get the motor home out of his workshop . <p> Outside the shop , he finds firefighters standing by three trucks . <p> " Why in the hell are n't you trying to put out the fire ? " he demands . <p> " We do n't use water out of the tankers until it hits a structure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grabs a garden hose . <p> " Do n't do that , you 'll have a heart attack , " a firefighter says . <p> " I been here 74 years , " Williams says . " If I have a heart attack , it 's my heart . If you guys are so goddamn afraid you 're going to burn to death , there 's a faucet at the end of that building and one here , right by you . Turn the goddamn water on and keep cool , or whatever the hell you want to do , since you 're not going to do nothing else , I guess . " <p> He strides away - and there , standing dazed in the road , is Ray McCarty . <p> " Norm , they would n't let me get my dogs out , " McCarty says . " My pickup 's burned up . Everything 's gone . " <p> Gone ? Williams suddenly remembers his other neighbor on Stagecoach Lane . <p> Beverly . Where 's Beverly ? <p> The two men look across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in flame . <p> To be continued . <p> TOMORROW : Thirty seconds too late . <p>  --  <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE - David Foster is AP 's Northwest Regional Writer , based in Seattle . <p> End Adv for Tuesday , Feb. 27 <p>
