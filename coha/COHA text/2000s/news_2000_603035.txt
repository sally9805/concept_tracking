<p> DENVER  --  On Dan Issel 's desk in the new Pepsi Center is a Keeneland sales catalogue . An avid horseman since his All-America playing days at the University of Kentucky , the coach , president and living legend of the Denver Nuggets is always scouting for fresh , young Thoroughbred talent . <p> In September , he went into partnership with three others and purchased four yearlings with an eye toward Churchill Downs and the 2002 Kentucky Derby . " They 're being broken now , " Issel says . <p> Ditto for his young , thin but rambunctious Nuggets . After three years in the NBA 's intensive care unit , they 're back among the living and , Issel boasts like a proud trainer , further along than his aspiring yearlings . " This team , " he says , " is a 2-year-old that has won at 6 furlongs and we 're hoping can go around two turns . " <p> Several signposts already have been passed . For the first time since 1997 , the Nuggets have won more games than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time since 1995 , they 're thinking playoffs . <p> And attendance , which plummeted below 12,000 during the 11-71 disaster two years ago and last season 's 14-36 misstep , is at 15,231 in the new downtown arena  --  and rising . <p> Even former Broncos superstar John Elway is coming to games . The local deity who rallied the crowd with his " Let 's get ready to Mutombo ! " cry as the Dikembe Mutombo-led Nuggets eliminated top-seed Seattle in a 1994 playoff stunner made his first appearance at a game in almost four years last week . <p> " I 've never seen him at a game , " marvels star forward Antonio McDyess , the cornerstone of the franchise . " That makes you feel good . We 've got something to play for now . " <p> That would be a playoff spot , the first step in Issel 's grand plan . The Nuggets go into tonight 's home game against Seattle positioned to challenge Minnesota for the Western Conference 's final playoff spot with a 17-16 mark . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Issel says . " That 's not fun to listen to . What 's really nice is to see the people coming back to the arena . I 'm excited with how much progress we 've made . " <p> Happy return <p> Issel flashes a quick , easy smile these days . He 's clearly rejuvenated in his return to the bench , in sharp contrast to the tortured look he had when he quit the Nuggets 34 games into the 1995-96 season . <p> At the time , Issel , soured by lack of front-office support and turned off by a handful of spoiled players , thought he was finished with the Nuggets . But he was wrong . Twice . <p> In March 1998 , in the throes of a horrific 71-loss season , Issel returned as general manager . Then last September , at the urging of a new ownership group that eventually backed out of its letter of intent to buy the franchise , he returned for a second tour on the bench . <p> Make no mistake  --  this is Issel 's team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over it . In what amounts to a third makeover in the last five years in which seven coaches and 60 players have come and gone , only Bryant Stith and Cory Alexander are holdovers from that 71-loss team . <p> As president , Issel coaxed superstar-in-the-making McDyess back to Denver as a free agent , signed bench leader George McCloud as a free agent , acquired in trades the backcourt of Nick Van Exel and Ron Mercer and rising star forward Keon Clark , and drafted center Raef LaFrentz and forward James Posey , two diamonds in the rough . <p> As coach , the man who has been part of 566 of Denver 's 1,292 victories as a player or coach has generaled the Nuggets to their best 33-game start since 1994-95 , despite an ugly 130-95 loss Monday to the Lakers in Los Angeles . Almost overnight , the Nuggets have more than the mile-high altitude in their corner  --  they have an attitude , especially at home . Denver is 13-5 at the Pepsi Center with wins against the Lakers , Toronto , Minnesota , Sacramento @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're even winning a little on the road ; a team that was 4-62 over the last two years is3-11 this season . <p> " They play hard , " Charlotte coach Paul Silas says . " They 've got good shot-blockers , and Nick has just taken this team over . When he 's on fire , they 'll play with anybody . " <p> Says Van Exel : " We 're definitely competing . We have something special here . " <p> That was evident last week , when the Nuggets hit their first rough patch of the season , losing three of four games and their hold of the No. 8 playoff spot to surging Minnesota . <p> The skid  --  the " middle-season blahs , " Issel calls them  --  prompted Van Exel to call a players-only meeting Friday . The Nuggets responded with an inspired come-from-behind win Saturday against Charlotte , with Van Exel scoring 32 points . <p> " As a young team , we tend to lose focus and not realize what 's important , " says Van Exel , the former Lakers point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's just a matter of time before everybody gets on the same page and understands we can be a good team . If we can stay together for some years , we can have something to be proud of , coming from where we came from , the bottom . " <p> Crossroads ahead <p> The franchise reaches a major crossroads after this season , when Mercer and injured guard Chauncey Billups become free agents . Convincing them to stay in Denver , where Van Exel is locked up through 2006 , McDyess through ' 04 , Posey through ' 03 , and LaFrentz , Clark and McCloud through ' 02 , is critical to franchise stability and credibility . <p> Mercer , the iron horse of the Nuggets who is averaging almost 40 minutes a game , originally was angered when he arrived from Boston and learned the in-limbo ownership situation precluded Issel from offering him a contract extension . But he has n't ruled out signing with the Nuggets . <p> " The chemistry here is pretty good , " Mercer says . " It can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't win , it 's going to go back to what it was . Right now , I 'm concentrating on the season . At the end of the year , I 'll look at all my options . But Denver will be in the mix . " <p> That 's music to Issel 's ear . He 's so passionate about turning the Nuggets back into a winner that he has put his heart even before his wallet ; he has gone almost half a season working on the contract that pays him as club president only . <p> Issel says he is talking to ownership about a multi-year contract as coach . " We 'll get it done in the next two , three weeks , " he says . " If I was somebody they hired to come in and do this from some place else , it 'd be different . But I played there for 10 years . I did TV for three or four . This is my second time around as coach . I 'm the president . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , this is the most important thing in my life . I want to bring them back . " <p> He pours his soul into both jobs . His players notice . " He 's a guy who really battles for you , " McDyess says . " You want to play for him . He gives it 100% . " <p> " Everybody wants to come to work now , " Stith says . <p> His biggest ally is Van Exel , who had a stormy relationship with coach Del Harris in L.A. " He 's like a sense of security for us , " Van Exel says . " He 's a Hall of Famer who has been through the wars . He 's somebody you can talk to all the time . He holds no grudges . " <p> Except against losing . <p> Denver 's new darlings Nuggets Broncos Season Attendance record record 1997-98 11,800 11-71 16-4 1998-99 11,879 14-36 17-2 1999-2000 15,231 17-16 6-10
