/Jan 2006 REVIEW SYORYU HONDA Tai Gallery/Textile Arts , Santa Fe , NM * July 22-30 , 2005 The work of Syoryu Honda demonstrates the unparalleled virtuosity of technique typical of the Japanese bamboo basket makers represented by Tai Gallery/Textile Arts since the late 1990s . The 13 baskets that were in the exhibit display a mastery of the weaving methods developed in Japan 's rigorous craft guilds since bamboo art 's nascence in the Edo period .

Photos/Carolyn Wright . // Honda uses the common madake. a Japanese timber bamboo , and traditional plaiting techniques , such assan-bon nawame ( three-stranded twining ) and the extremely tight ajiro ( twill plaiting , to make undulat ing forms that a re decidedly nontraditiona I and more appropriately described as sculptures than baskets . For the nawame works , he creates a single-strand grid as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grid . The weave flows from very open to extremely tight , emphasizing tension at the bends . Mountain River , 2005 , looks like a woven blanket that has been folded upon itself and twisted , evoking water as it eddies on the surface of a stream . The tripled strands join and separate irregularly , amplifying a sense of motion . In other works , such as Shadow , 2005 , and Prominence , 2004 , the weavings take the form of oval tubes of air that often are whimsical . Prominence appears to be constructed of two intertwined tubes , but in fact is a continuous loop twisted like a child 's finger puzzle . These works stress elegance , balance , symmetry and light , while the ajiro pieces , of tightly woven ( 10 chevrons to the inch ) , nearly flattened tubes , are simpler and more purely sculptural , and the symmetry necessary for structural balance is less evident . Reincarnation , 2004 , a golden , vertical tubular form , is an aptly titled , tangled but lyrical set of intertwined loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a single braid of rope , one looped end protruding through the other , and appears impossibly balanced . An untitled 2005 work in a darker hue borrows the same basic idea , but the braid is twisted upon itself more aggressively , one end suspended horizontally in air , as if defying gravity . These ropelike works are Honda 's most exquisite , abandoning all vestiges of the traditional basket fora delight in form . They compare favorably with works by the elder Japanese master Kenichi Nagakura , who also explores organic shapes . But Nagakura 's basket forms refer directly to nature , suggesting bird 's nests and shells ; Honda has taken a more conceptual route . Now 54 , Honda learned basket-making techniques as a child from his father , who had a basket production business . As a young man , he worked as a basket wholesaler to finance studies in bamboo craft at a vocational school in Beppu . After graduation , in 1978 , he continued to make flower and tea baskets for 10 years , then apprenticed to a master basket maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to gain national recognition for his work . When the Japanese economy nose-dived in the early 199Os , basket makers , never paid well for their work , began to suffer even more financial difficulty . Honda confronted the bamboo wholesalers to press for better pay on the artists ' behalf . In retribution , wholesalers quit buying in 1998 , Rob Coff land , who is the co-owner with Mary Hunt Kahlenberg of Tai Gallery , came upon a basket made by Honda in a store , tracked the artist down to a gas station where he was working and commissioned another . Through the gallery Syoryu Honda has found success again and has since been admitted to major bamboo exhibitions and associations in Japan . His work is in the collections of the Museum of Arts &; Design in New York and the San Francisco Asian Art Museum . - HOLLIS WALKER Photograph BELOW : Aurora , 2005 , madake bamboo and rattan , nawame technique . 19 by 15 by 19 inches .
