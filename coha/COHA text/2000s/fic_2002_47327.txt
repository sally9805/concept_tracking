In the days that summer when his mother had to work cleaning the cottages in Dachenko and Koslan , Anton was being watched by the Shurins . He was twelve and blind , and his mother feared leaving him alone . He spent his mornings working with Oleg Shurin in the tomato patches along the bluff , and in the afternoons he and Oleg took long walks on the dirt paths of the fields and forests around their village . Anton would follow Oleg 's voice or the crackle of his steps through the grass and do his best to map their course in his mind , counting paces and turns , noting sounds and directions and angles of descent or ascent . Beyond the tomato patches and the bluff was a deep ravine leading down to the river , which ran very shallow and calm that year because of the drought . <p> They had finished pruning the plants and pulling the weeds , and the sun was high , but there was still time before lunch , so Anton and Oleg walked down the ravine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his magazines hidden in a metal box . Oleg was three years older and was teaching Anton about women . He had seen and touched and kissed them . They lay in the weedy undergrowth , and Oleg read from the magazines and described the pictures aloud . <p> " - one velvety peach mound cupped in her- " <p> " Wait , Oleg , where do you mean ? " <p> " There . " Oleg took Anton 's finger and touched it to the slick paper , tracing out a vague pattern . Then he took Anton 's palm and pressed it against his chest . " Instead of flat , like us , you know , she 's holding them . Mounds . " Anton could feel Oleg puffing his chest out , but it was still hard and flat : breastplate , bone , sternum . Anton removed his palm and placed it against his own chest , then moved it to his stomach . <p> " Mounds ! Anton turned his face back toward the hottest angle of the sun . It would have been nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's pretty much it . She 's just lying there . " <p> From across the river they could hear hammers striking and echoing where workers were building more summer cottages for the New Russians from Moscow , who were n't Communists . <p> " What about her legs ? What kind of legs ? " <p> " It only shows her hips and the tops of her thighs . There 's the edge of some white cotton panties . The rest is cut off . " <p> " Cut off ? " <p> " You know , not in the picture . A picture can only show so much , Anton . " <p> " How much ? " <p> Over the ravine Oleg 's grandmother started calling them to lunch . <p> " Depends . " <p> Anton had never touched or kissed a girl , and the only thighs he knew besides his own were his mother 's . In Anton 's dreams his mother had heavy , rippled thighs that rubbed together when she walked . They said her hair was reddish blond and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oleg had told him , reddish blond was a good thing to be , and the color of thighs was pink . <p> " Like the belly of a rabbit . " <p> In fact Anton 's mother 's thighs were no longer fatty , though . She had done the Herbalife diet and wasted away to a much smaller presence when she walked or sat beside him . It did n't make much difference , he supposed , and the other women in the village kept telling her she looked wonderful , but Anton missed the soft pillowy squish of her body from his younger years . <p> The metal box clicked open and shut , which meant that Oleg 's magazines were stored away again and the lesson was done . Oleg rustled through the bushes to deposit the box back in its hiding place . Anton stood up and walked down toward the river to give him some privacy ; Oleg liked a little time alone after their lessons . Anton could hear the water moving against the rocks , and it was a different sound from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rush around him as he got closer to the water . He slipped off his sandals and felt his way down the bank with his hands close to the ground , then he waded several steps into the water . It was only knee-deep this summer , but still Anton was forbidden to go near it . <p> Anton stood up to his calves and felt the water swerve in circles around his feet . Something soft , a leaf maybe , drifted between his legs . The current was nearly imperceptible unless he lifted one foot and let it dangle in the flow . Then he could feel the tug and push of the water , affirming his bearings . He was still facing east , still perpendicular to the bank . He turned downstream , unzipped his pants , and relieved himself , listening to distinguish his trickle of water from the rest . <p> " Zzzzzzzz , " Oleg called from the ravine when he was finished . That was the sound of Dr. Nicholson 's drill . Anton made his way out of the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zzzzzz . " Oleg snickered . Anton was going to the dentist tomorrow . Neither of the boys had ever been , but a year ago Anton 's mother had begun cleaning house for an American dentist , Dr. Nicholson , and he was giving them a special rate . Anton felt for his sandals along the bank where he had left them . <p> " Looking for these ? " Oleg tapped Anton twice on the head with the sandals . <p> " Give me them . " <p> " Just kidding . " Oleg put the sandals into Anton 's hand . <p> Anton tried to clear the distress from his face . " I know . " He had been teased often , and by many kids . Oleg was only teaching him to be tough . <p> " I 've got something for you , " Oleg said , pressing some coins into Anton 's palm . " Tomorrow , if you get a chance , see if you ca n't pick me up a copy of Pentxaus . My cousin says he finds them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . " Well . I wo n't be alone , you know ? " How could he buy a girlie magazine with his mother ? <p> " Ah , of course . Your mother by your side . I can see how that 's a problem . " Oleg had started talking this way lately . He was getting ready for high school . <p> " Not that I do n't want to . " Anton held out the rubles for Oleg to take back . <p> " Of course . " Oleg started up the ravine . " Me , if I were going , it 'd be a different situation . " <p> Anton fastened the last buckle of his sandals and hurried after Oleg . " Maybe you could come with us . " <p> " To the dentist ? To the zzzzzzzzz American dentist ? No thanks . ' <p> Anton pushed the fistful of coins at Oleg 's back . " No , just keep the money , " Oleg said . " In case . Just see what you can do . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I could buy some gum for you . " <p> " Kid stuff . " <p> Oleg 's grandmother called for them again from the top of the bluff . <p> " Maybe your mom will run off to the bathroom , " Oleg said . " Leave you waiting next to a newsstand . ' <p> Anton turned the idea over in his mind . It could happen . <p> " Maybe some doll will pick you up at the station , show you a thing or two . " <p> Anton could feel his face starting to flush , and he hesitated , then stammered , " Maybe , maybe Dr. Nicholson has a nurse . ' <p> " Oh , that 's it . I bet he does , some fine thing . She 's going to lean all over you . You 'll forget all about my magazines . ' <p> They were halfway up the ravine by now and had forgotten their ritual . " Wait " Oleg said , turning suddenly and taking Anton roughly by the shoulders . Anton steadied himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , come alone never , " Oleg murmured methodically , spinning Anton around several times on the uneven soil . Then they stood still , waiting for the dizziness to subside , and Anton repeated the chant himself . It was an empty ritual by now . Who would he tell ? Why on earth ? No one had ever shown Anton as much as Oleg had . <p> But the ritual was a carryover from the early days , before they were truly friends , when Anton 's mother first went to work and Oleg and his grandmother took over watching Anton . Oleg had n't trusted him yet back then , which was understandable . The metal box contained considerable treasure . But now the spinning had no effect : Anton could make his way to Oleg 's secret spot alone , in the rain , even in the snow , he supposed . It was sixty-five paces west of the railway bridge , and with the noise of the stream as a guide there was almost no way to get lost . Anton felt as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's footsteps . Now he scrambled up the ravine in the path Oleg snapped through the brush , keeping low to the ground and using his hands for balance . <p> " Where have you been ? " Oleg 's grandmother approached them after they crossed the field and neared her house . She jingled a litde for some reason as she walked . <p> " We caught that rabbit eating at the plants again , " Oleg said . " We were chasing it down " <p> " My boys . Did you catch it ? " <p> Oleg nudged Anton . " Not yet . Maybe after lunch . " <p> Oleg 's grandmother put a hand on Anton 's back and patted it . " I bet you 'll get it next time . Can you catch a rabbit , Anton ? " <p> Anton leaned into her hand . She had a pleasant berry smell . <p> " Well , come on now . I 've got lunch waiting . " She took Anton 's elbow and led him in slow , careful steps toward the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the source . <p> " There 's the gate now . " She guided him into the side yard and paused to pat the little dog . " Privet , Mishul " ' The table would be twelve steps forward , then three right . Anton could find it all very well on his own , but he liked the feel of her , large and soft , against his side . " Here 's our table , Anton . You take this seat right here . " She placed his hand against the chair , and he sat down to their usual lunch in the shade of the root shed . On the table he could smell fried potatoes with pepper and salt , and tomato salad with vinegar . Oleg got close behind him and hummed , " Zzzzzzzzz , " in his ear . <p> " Oleg , you stop that . What is that ? " she demanded . <p> " Nothing . " <p> When she went into the house for more bread , Anton whispered , " What 's the jingling ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's trying to impress Sasha next door now that his wife has died . " <p> Oleg 's grandmother returned . " I hear you 're going to the dentist tomorrow , Anton . " <p> " Yes , tomorrow . " <p> " They have these long metal picks and instruments they stick right into your teeth . " Oleg tapped his fork against the table . <p> " Be quiet , Oleg , " she said . <p> " It 's true " he persisted . " I saw it on television . They drill big holes in your teeth . " <p> Anton put down his bread and ran his tongue along his molars . <p> " See what a coward Oleg is ? But you 're not afraid , are you , Anton ? " <p> " No , " he said , pushing his chin up , but the idea of drills vibrating against his teeth and gums was terrible and foreign to him . <p> Dr. Nicholson worked at a practice for the new rich and the foreigners , and it was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some kind of exchange program for introducing new dentistry to the Russian doctors , and his schedule was booked all the time . Anton 's mother had been working as the cleaning lady at his summer house for almost a year now , and he paid her in dollars , not rubles . He had an apartment in the city and a place back in America probably , and a two-story cottage in Dachenko that he visited only two or three weekends a month . Anton 's mother took care of the garden , which was hard in this dry summer , and she cleaned up before and after him when he visited . The pay was outrageous ; she made more in one month than Anton 's father , before he left them , had ever made in a year . Sometimes Dr. Nicholson paid her extra just to go there in the evenings and turn lights on and off as if someone were living there . <p> Anton 's mother was fascinated by Dr. Nicholson and talked of him to everyone . She came home with fresh stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his cottage . " What kind of dentistry can be done on computer ? And who works at their cottage anyway ? " Dr. Nicholson has a new car , can you imagine , two cars for one man with no family ? " These Americans . " Dr. Nicholson is learning Russian , really learning it . He can talk ! Not just through his secretary , but really talk . Today we sat down for tea together . " She hummed songs all evening after that day . <p> But the most remarkable thing about Dr. Nicholson , according to Anton 's mother , was his teeth . " So white and perfect they 're almost unnatural . No wonder they brought him all this way . It really makes me quite afraid to smile . " <p> The first thing she did , after meeting Dr. Nicholson , was that she came home and taught Anton how to smile without opening his lips . They sat together with their fingers on each other 's mouths for an entire afternoon practicing this . " That 's pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before long you 'll be turning heads yourself . " <p> Anton had gaps between his teeth . <p> By early spring Anton 's mother had saved enough for an appointment of her own . The Herbalife diet was over , and she was thin and , as everyone said , lovely , and she wanted her teeth to be handsome as well . Dr. Nicholson fitted her into his schedule and gave her twenty-five percent off . " The Americans are known for their generosity , " she told Anton . And though she came home that evening saying , " Yes , truly it was rather painless , " her voice seemed tightened by pain as she said it , and she kept getting up in the night , popping open the aspirin bottle . But the neighbors did say it was a great improvement in her smile . <p> And now she had saved enough again to give Anton a turn . She was very proud and pleased at the idea and had already told everyone they knew . <p> " Just wait till you meet Dr. Nicholson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . " I think you 'll really like him <p> Anton lay very still . <p> " You will be nice to him , wo n't you , druzhok ? " <p> Anton wanted to tell her that his teeth were just fine , that they never bothered or hurt him at all . They were hard and clicked together when he chewed ; there was nothing rotten or soft about them . A dentist was quite unnecessary . Dr. Nicholson in general could go back from where he came . <p> But she leaned , thin and new , over him in the bed and brushed his hair back tenderly . " Just think how handsome you 'll be for all the girls . " <p> She stroked her thumbs along his eyelids to make him sleepy . <p> " There 'll be nobody anywhere with teeth so fine , " she said . Anton could tell she was smiling . He could just feel it . <p> They had to start out early in the morning and with good clothes on . Anton 's ironed shirt pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thighs and groin when he walked . But by the time they 'd made it halfway to the train station on the dusty , rutted road , the sun was warm on their necks , and his clothes seemed to stretch out a little with the perspiration . <p> " This is the big day , yes , Anton ? " <p> He did n't want to talk about it . <p> " And you 'll see , it wo n't even hurt a bit . " <p> Anton ran his tongue between his lip and his upper teeth , letting it slip in and out between the gaps . They might be gone by the end of the day . There was no telling what could happen . His breath was fresh , his teeth just brushed and slick . <p> " How handsome you 'll be , " she mused , then stumbled and put a hand on his shoulder to steady herself in the ruts . <p> When they reached the train platform , they stood on the cement with the morning commuters , shuffling their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this every day , right , Anton ? We are truly lucky people . " <p> " Do you go this way to Dr. Nicholson 's cottage ? " <p> " I go the other direction , Anton . I go northwest , which is that way . " She held out his arm a little forward and to the right . <p> " So the city is that way ? " Anton pointed his other hand in the opposite direction . <p> " Good . And show me south . " <p> Anton pointed . <p> " My smart boy . Such a smart boy . " The platform began to quiver , and Anton 's mother moved in close behind him and held his shoulders firmly with both hands to protect him . The elektrichka rumbled in ; it was quieter but seemed to move faster than the regular trains . Soon Anton 's mother was guiding him forward quickly in the shuffle of bodies , and he was pushed up against the backs and shoulders of the commuters . " Watch out , " said an old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she paused and said , " Oh , sorry . " <p> " Here now , darling , quickly . " Anton 's mother tried to guide him to a seat before they all filled up . The train was already thick with the breath and newspaper scent of commuters from towns farther out . " Oh , here we go , Anton . " She patted his hand to a seat . He sat down and felt the thigh of a woman next to him on the bench . She seemed to scoot away from him . He could feel his mother still standing next to him on the aisle , shuffling forward each time someone passed by . <p> " No , you sit , Mom . " He stood up . <p> " I 'm fine , dear . " She put her hand on his shoulder , pressing him downward again . <p> " Really . " He stood up with his legs spread for balance and locked his knees . <p> " Well , all right . Here . " She sat down and shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit on her lap the way children do . He lost his balance and landed on her , sitting there for a moment as she wished . But she had grown smaller , or he had gotten bigger . He felt ridiculous , too large , too awkward , and he pushed away from her , standing back up . <p> " No , " he insisted , and stood hanging on to the back of the bench . <p> And so they stayed like this , she on the seat , he clutching the seatback with one hand and her shoulder with the other , swaying with the motion of the train for over an hour in the morning odors of the passengers . Aftershave , alcohol , cigarettes , coffee . The freshness of his own breath started to make Anton feel separate at first , and then a little nauseated , and his mouth began to water . They passed the stops for V61kovo , Druzhba , and Abramtsevo , and the humming and screeching of the train accelerating and braking each time filled Anton 's thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to sweat at the brow and under his arms . <p> He closed his eyes and tried to breathe deeply for a while , thinking of Oleg 's picture girls and the stream and the sun and the tomatoes and dust which would be there when he returned . He turned Oleg 's coins over in his pocket , stacking them up and letting them slip apart again . It would be nice to be able to help Oleg for a change . It would be nice to be the one who held the treasure . <p> The closer they got to the city , the more crowded the train became , until finally Anton did n't have to hold on to his mother 's shoulder because it was too crowded for him to fall down . When the doors opened at Kurskii Vokzal in Moscow , the warm , damp bodies in the aisle pushed forward with such force that Anton 's mother lost her grip on him , bruising his wrist in one last attempt to snatch him , and she had to call after the babushka next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blind . Hold my boy . " Anton cringed , and the woman grabbed his arm so that her bag banged hard against his thigh . When they reached the doorway and the steps , the woman pushed her bag into the space behind Anton to divide him from the rest of the passengers and called out , " Hold still for a minute , thugs , we 've got a blind boy here . " <p> " There 's the step , there you go , there 's another one , little guy . " She held tightly to Anton 's arm on the platform until his mother arrived . " Thank you . " <p> " Pozhaluista . " <p> Anton 's face burned with humiliation , and he blinked his eyes against the insult of this woman 's hand on his arm . But the air of the open station yard felt cool on his skin and contained a hundred unfamiliar smells . <p> " This city , " Anton 's mother said . I do n't see how people can stand it . Let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform toward the noise of the station buildings . Women in heels clicked erratically around them , people brushed past them and overcame them from behind , and all the while the trains were coming and going with the ding dong dong of the departure announcements . <p> " Where to now ? " <p> " We 'll go down to the metro station and take it through the center , then transfer down to Profsoyuznaya , " she said . <p> " Is it far ? " <p> " We have plenty of time . Hold still , let me wipe your face . " <p> " What direction are we going now ? " <p> " This is- " She stopped walking a moment and turned around a little . " I think this is south , dear . " <p> " That 's south , " a man next to them said . <p> " Oh . We 're going east right now , dear . " <p> They walked on toward the station buildings , and the sound from the loudspeakers got louder . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right where the cafes and kiosks must have been . Some men brushed past them smelling of fish and stale alcohol . They were speaking a strange , jumbled language . <p> Anton inhaled and gathered his courage , then squeezed his mother 's arm . " I 'd like to buy a magazine , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> " For Oleg . Oleg wants a certain ... he wants a car magazine . ' <p> " A car magazine ? What for ? " <p> " I do n't know . He likes them . " <p> " Car magazines . What will it be next ? " She stopped and pulled him out of the line of traffic . He could feel her body leaning in different directions , looking for the right kiosk . Then she led him a few steps to their right , which Anton figured must be south . They were up against the cool metal of a kiosk now ; it was still damp from the morning . A man leaned in over Anton 's shoulder and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . Anton 's mother pulled him to the side again . <p> " What kind of car magazine ? " <p> " Do they have a lot of magazines ? Is it a well-stocked kiosk ? " <p> " They 're all well-stocked nowadays , Anton . What they would n't sell you . Which one do you want ? They have Avtomobil ' from May and July , and the current Motor , and Voditel ' - that one has a lovely purple car . Very strange . " <p> Anton paused . <p> " Well ? What do you think he 'd like ? " <p> " I think ... I think he has those already . I think it 's supposed to have a truck . Something with a truck . " <p> Anton 's mother asked the woman through the window about trucks . They did n't have any truck magazines . <p> " But they have lots of magazines ? " <p> " Yes , Anton . Do you want a different one ? " <p> He could be grown-up like Oleg . They could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , Mom ? " <p> " Anton , stop this . What is this about ? " <p> " I ... I- " A mechanical female voice interrupted him through the speakers over his head , announcing the departure of the next train to Kursk . Anton felt as though he were being swallowed up by her voice , by the vibrating speakers everywhere , by the crush of strangers poking in at him through the dark void before his eyes . " I have to go to the bathroom " he said at last . <p> " You have to go to the bathroom . " Her words came out slowly , evenly , but Anton could hear the frustration welling in them . She pulled him toward her by both shoulders and snapped her words into his face . " Anton . This is n't funny . " <p> He 'd had enough , too . " I know . " <p> " Well , you 'll have to wait till Dr. Nicholson 's . We 're not going in any train station bathroom , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be sick , " Anton lied . He did n't know what he was doing . In his mind a vague plan was struggling to take shape . His muscles stiffened one by one , and a cold tingle swept up his limbs to his throat . He clenched his jaw against the idea of Dr. Nicholson 's instruments and imagined himself taller and broad-shouldered , strong . He imagined himself so big that his mother could n't drag him anywhere . " I 'm going to be sick , " he said again . <p> She sighed . She lightened her grip on his arm . They started walking again , eastward . One two three four five six seven eight . She paused and asked someone about a bathroom . " Inside by the ticket booths , " a man said . <p> " Did n't you go before we left ? " <p> Twenty-nine . Thirty . Thirty-one . " I guess not . " They turned right . Forty-eight , forty-nine , through heavy doors that pushed in both directions , into a heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more announcement bells , a puddle , and down six steps , then around a landing and down seven more . Fifty-six , fifty-seven , to the right . He could find his way back to the kiosk alone . Seventy-four , seventy-five , seventy-six . They stopped . He could take a breath in the bathroom and calm himself , break free of her and find his way back to the kiosk and to Dachenko and the tomato fields and the Shurins . He could do that . She could go see Dr. Nicholson without him . <p> They had neared the bathrooms : the scent of urine and excrement seeped through the air . " We 'll have to wait for help , " Anton 's mother said . She was breathing heavy with disgust . It was an area where no one would choose to stand around . <p> " I can do it alone . " <p> " No . " <p> He shuffled and squirmed . " I 'm sick , Mom . I 'm sick . ' <p> " Excuse me . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They waited . " Excuse me , " she said again to another . " My son needs to go to the bathroom . " No response . He must have walked away . <p> " I can do it myself , " Anton groaned . <p> " I said no . " <p> " Excuse me . " This time her voice was forceful , urgent . And she must have gotten someone 's attention , for it turned soft again . " My son here needs to go to the bathroom . Be kind , would you take him in for me ? He 's blind , you see . " <p> " Well , hello . " The man smelled of chicken soup , yesterday 's chicken soup . <p> Anton 's mother drove a finger into his back . " Hello , " Anton said . " Well , let 's go , then . " <p> Anton 's face was hot with embarrassment . He took the man 's arm , which felt dusty and frail under his textured suit jacket . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked in a low voice as they walked through the door and deeper into the stench . <p> " Yes . Of course . " The floor was wet and slippery . <p> " How did it happen , may I ask ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " The eyes . " <p> Hundred seven . Eight . Nine , right on nine . The room was quiet except for a faucet dripping somewhere . <p> " Do n't like to talk about it ? " <p> Anton said nothing . He did n't know how it had happened . He was born to this . <p> " That 's all right . Here you go . " The man took Anton 's hand and placed it against the cool porcelain of the urinal . " Do n't touch it too much , but here it is right in front of you . Is that all right ? " <p> If there were another door he could slip out of , if he could make himself small , unnoticeable , he could slip away from this old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kiosk . One hundred nine steps was nothing ; it was half the distance from Oleg 's house to the river . And he could ask someone for help if he got lost . He could do it , he could slap his coins down for the lady in the kiosk and say Pentxaus with authority , without fear or hesitation of any kind . He would walk away a man , like any normal man , with the magazine tucked into his pants under his shirt . He would catch the next train to Dachenko and be back in time for lunch with Oleg and Grandma Shurin . And she 'd be sorry , his mother . She would worry and worry . She would think twice about her American dentist . <p> " Is there another door in here ? " <p> " What ? " The man shuffled around a little and came back to Anton 's side . " No . Just the one . " <p> The dripping faucet echoed against the walls and floor around him . Anton felt his face beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem , son ? " <p> There was nowhere he could go . <p> " I need a toile " <p> " Oh , I see . Right : ' He took Anton 's arm aga- and turned him around , but in turning the old man slipped on the wet tile and began to go down . " Oi ! " He clutched at Anton 's torso with both arms , pressing Anton 's head into his hot , damp chest . They wavered a moment , flailing , but did not go down . They stood upright on the tile floor , trembling , without so much as a bumped elbow or knee to knock the thrill out of their bones . <p> All of his numbers were gone , flown from his head . All his bearings , all his points of reference . Anton did n't even know where the door was . He was n't going to get to the kiosk alone , or to the train or Dachenko or anywhere . He was a little boy clutching at an old man in a stinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his mother worrying at the door . And he was not sick at all , though the stench was enough to turn anyone 's stomach , and Oleg was home in the field pulling weeds and dreaming of his girls without so much as a thought for Anton or the coins he 'd charged him with . <p> " Well , are you going in or not ? " the man said impatiently , pressing Anton 's hand against the gritty door of the stall . <p> Anton stood in the growing heat of his face and neck . In his tight pants with his hand on the metal door , he faced the stall like a fate he could n't step into . <p> " Go to hell , " Anton murmured . From behind them came the click of dress shoes and then the sound of someone urinating . <p> " Pardon ? " <p> " You heard me , " Anton whispered . <p> " This is how you treat an old man ? " <p> " Go to hell . " <p> This time the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother did on rare occasion . On the behind . He spanked him . <p> The tears came now ; there was no chance of stopping them . " Pervert , " Anton hissed in one last attempt at manliness . " Get your hands off me . " <p> " What 's going on here ? " the dress-shoes man at the urinal said . <p> " Kids . Kids today do n't know how to behave . ' <p> " Stop touching me ! " Anton cried . " Do n't touch me . ' The old man removed his hand and took a step back , and now Anton was alone against the door of the stall , sinking down . He crouched low on the wet , filthy floor , and the tears rolled out of his eyes . He sucked at the air in unsteady patches . There was no one anywhere who could ever fix this . There was no way he would be cured , no way he was ever going to walk to a kiosk or look at a magazine , no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , dear boy , " his mother 's voice came at the door , and she rushed in to him . She kneeled down on the floor in the middle of the men 's room and folded him in her embrace . <p> " What have you done ? " she hissed at the old man . <p> " He 's crazy , " the old man said . <p> " I just found them like this , lady , " said the man who had been at the urinal . <p> And then the room seemed to clear out and get quiet , and she rocked him there on the floor against her chest , back and forth . She let his sobs erupt in her arms without asking questions . She stroked his hair and the back of his neck and said , " That 's all right , darling . That 's all right . " <p> " I do n't want to go to Dr. Nicholson 's . " <p> " You 're sick , dear , it 's all right .
