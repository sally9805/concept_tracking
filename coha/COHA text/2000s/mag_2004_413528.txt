Silent Pumping Any kind of pump on board a small boat  --  whether a bilge pump , a freshwater pump or even a baitwell pump  --  can drive you crazy with its intermittent cycling . Most manufacturers mount the pumps firmly to the hull or a bulkhead , which acts like a sounding board to transmit noise and vibration throughout the boat . When my freshwater pump kicked on yet again at 3 a.m. because of a faint drip from the sink faucet , I knew I had to find a cure . The solution was to insulate the pump motor using two pieces of automotive heater hose ( 1 1/4 " outside diameter ) . I cut each end of the hose on a 45-degree angle , and then drilled the hose ends to match the holes on each side of the pump base . I secured the pump to the two hoses by holding nuts and washers in place inside the hose while threading machine screws down from above . ( An alternative procedure is to push machine screws up from inside the hose . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws through the hose bottoms . By doing this , I eliminated most of the vibration and noise from the freshwater pump , and I now sleep better at night . Chris Caswell Los Alamitos , Calif . Auxiliary Legs The forward dinette on our express cruiser has a table that sits on two pedestals and drops down to convert to a double berth . Getting in and out of the bunk sometimes caused the forward edge of the table to lift up slightly and disconnect from the forward pedestal . And it would not slip back down into place easily . To solve this problem , I measured the distance from the underside of the table 's aft edge to the sole when it was in the lowered position , and then purchased a length of 1 1/2 " stainless steel pipe that was long enough to cut into two lengths ( PVC pipe would work just as well ) . I cut the pipe into two lengths , each measuring 1/8 " shorter than the height I measured beneath the table . I also purchased two PVC end caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole in the center of each cap , and then mounted each one on a corner beneath the table 's aft edge . I put rubber caps on the other end of the pipes . Now , when we lower the table , I slip the auxiliary legs into the PVC end caps with the rubber cap ends on the sole , and the bunk/table never lifts up when we lay down or get up . Bill Simmons Honey Brook , Pa . Easy Chairs If you , like many boat owners , have aluminum folding chairs for your cockpit , you 've probably found that the hollow aluminum legs soon wear through the rubber end caps , causing gouges and scratches on the deck when the chairs are used . To prevent this from happening , slide off the cap and insert a stainless steel or brass washer into the cap before replacing it on the leg . By sizing the washer to the diameter of the cap , you 'll keep the leg from cutting through and marring your deck . Replacement caps are available at marine hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also are used on the bottoms of canes . Bill Pendleton Ft . Lauderdale , Fla . Engine Gauge Markings Do n't wait for audible alarms to warn you of an impending engine problem . When running , it 's wise to regularly glance at your instrument panel and mentally note any irregularities in normal readings . Distractions at the helm can make it tough for the skipper to recognize " creeping " gauge needles . Create your own set of custom gauge marks . Simply purchase some brightly colored paper or waterline tape that has adhesive on the back side and can be easily shaped with a pair of scissors . Cut a slender arrow point , peel off the backing and adhere it to the outside of the instrument gauge , with the broad end toward the center of the gauge , at the position of your normal running temperature , amperage , rpm , etc . This will give you an easy-to-see reference point , making you immediately aware of any abnormalities . Capt . Jack Salisbury Rocky River , Ohio Shaft Stopper The idea of using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of a transmission coupling failure ( Handyman , January 2003 ) is fine for boats with smaller shafts ; however , the price goes up quickly as the diameter of the shaft increases . A stainless steel hose clamp works very well in some applications and is less costly . Use two with the screw mechanisms on opposite sides of the shaft to prevent vibration .
