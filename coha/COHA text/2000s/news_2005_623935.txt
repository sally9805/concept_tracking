<p> ' Profiles in courage ' by 4 Senate Republicans <p> Editor  --  I would like to commend four Republicans in the U.S. Senate who stood up to President Bush , Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and House Speaker Dennis Hastert and told their party and their country that liberty comes before security . <p> If we are going to show Iraq , the radical Islamic groups and the world that America does what is right , we must follow the Sen. John McCains , who say no to any mistreatment of prisoners regardless of the justification , and the Sen. Larry Craigs , who insist that to be safe , we must guard the freedoms given to us in the Constitution and Bill of Rights . <p> Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , John Sununu of New Hampshire and Craig voted their consciences instead of staying in lockstep with the new Joe McCarthys . Because of it , we are a better country . Do n't be fooled by Frist . His " no " vote to go along with the majority was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures . <p> LAURENCE COHN <p> Livermore <p> Bad news from Iraq <p> Editor <p>  --  If Chuck Huntington 's list of statistics on Iraq ( Letters , " There 's some good news from Iraq , " Dec. 16 ) was intended to be good news , it fell seriously short . <p> The " military source " who provided them failed to answer some important questions , such as what has become of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis made homeless when Fallujah and other cities were largely destroyed by U.S. air strikes . How has the increasing dominance of sectarian militias in certain areas affected the freedom of women ? Has the quality of life for most Iraqis improved ? <p> What no one can measure is the heartbreak endured by the families of the more than 30,000 Iraqis killed so far in this war , or the suffering of the thousands who have been maimed or burned . <p> The Bush administration 's attempt to impose its will on Iraq has brought misery to that country , and the fact that 80 percent of Iraqis want our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> RACHELLE MARSHALL <p> Stanford <p> Unease over economy <p> Editor  --  I do n't know whether to laugh or cry about your Dec. 16 editorial , " An edgy economy . " Laugh at its wide-eyed bewilderment with public concern about the economy , or cry because of its simplistic assessment . Readily available statistics explain the growing unease of most Americans . <p> Despite four years of " recovery , " real wages have declined by 5 cents an hour . Growing productivity has swelled corporate profits , but workers are working harder for less money . Health-care costs for workers continue to rise . The Federal Reserve policy of raising interest rates hits the middle class with a double whammy , keeping wage growth down , while raising costs on the variable-rate interest loans that are fueling the housing boom . <p> The Bush tax policy is working as designed : rewarding the investing class , while keeping the middle class quiet and consuming . <p> It does n't take an economics genius to know why Americans do n't feel optimistic . In the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical issue . <p> JOHN KATZ <p> San Francisco <p> Pro-tax liberals <p> Editor  --  Letter-writer Patty Branton ( " Walking the walk , " Dec. 16 ) brags that liberals are pro-this and pro-that , but forgot ( ? ) to mention their being pro-tax . That may translate into liberals walking the walk all right , but it means doing it with my wallet in their hand . <p> JAMES P. TENNEY <p> Eureka <p> U.S. border ' mission ' <p> Editor  --  The Border Protection Control Act , HR4437 , now before Congress , is designed to stop the entry of 700,000 illegal immigrants annually . It calls for mandatory prison sentences as felons for the people caught . If we were to catch all the illegal entrants , and impose the mandatory prison sentences , we would need to build somewhere around 280 prisons in order to announce " mission accomplished . " <p> This seems about as likely as the total victory in the " war on terrorism " recently promised by our foolish president . <p> ELISE KROEBER <p> San Francisco <p> A big stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tragic incident at the Miami International Airport ( " Panic attack , " Dec. 15 ) shows us once again how far the Bush-haters can contort themselves as they stretch to ridicule the war we fight against terrorists . <p> To Koehler , the " hair trigger " reaction by air marshals in an era of terrorist hijackers amounts to a " flailing , messy overreaction to nothing much . " Nothing much ? I have been on an airplane during an incident where a deranged passenger began to threaten the crew and other passengers , and I can inform Koehler that it is something other than " nothing much . " <p> To Koehler , Miami was just another reason to blame Bush for the circumstances that led to the death of a man we later learned was mentally ill . Of course , Koehler fails to offer how he would prosecute anything as " flailing and messy " as a war . <p> STAN DeVAUGHN <p> Los Altos <p> Hope for Pacific fisheries <p> Editor  --  As one who depends on fish for his livelihood and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial calling attention to the reauthorization of America 's primary fishery law , the Magnuson-Stevens Act ( " A federal fish license , " Dec. 15 ) . <p> Sen. Barbara Boxer has done an excellent job working with both this state 's fishermen and environmentalists . Her leadership has helped get language in the Magnuson-Stevens Act promoting ecosystem-based management  --  critical to our salmon fisheries  --  and to establish the Conservation and Management Trust Fund to assure there will be money for fishery research and restoration so we will have data to know how to avoid overfishing along with the resources to rebuild our valuable fish stocks . <p> LARRY COLLINS <p> Vice President <p> Crab Boat Owners Association <p> San Francisco <p> Port reform <p> Editor  --  Supervisor Aaron Peskin is right on target with his proposal for the June 2006 ballot to reform the San Francisco Port Commission . <p> Instead of malls and giant hotels , we need public access , recreational uses and ideas to make the port financially solvent without simply selling off our unique waterfront to the highest bidder . Reforming the Port Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco <p> Worst in their leagues <p> Editor  --  The 49ers ca n't win games , the SFPD ca n't catch bad guys . The 49ers produce in-house videos in bad taste , the SFPD make in-house videos in bad taste . The 49ers have severe morale problems , the SFPD has the worse morale problem ever . <p> I do n't blame the head coach of the 49ers , I blame the owners . I do n't blame the police chief , I blame the mayor . In Gavin Newsom 's own words , " If the homicide rate does n't go down , I should be recalled . " The only thing that comes to mind is : Where 's Eddie and Willie ? <p> RENNIE O'BRIEN <p> San Francisco <p>  --  ' Little genius ' farce <p> Editor  --  Your Dec. 15 editorial , " The making of little geniuses , " made some excellent points . Most of the videos seem created more to get junior to sit quietly out of mom 's way than to engage him in a real learning experience . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant with the flickering light of a television screen , regardless of program content , can be detrimental . <p> The American Academy of Pediatrics officially discourages any television at all for children under the age of 2 : " Research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant caregivers for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social , emotional and cognitive skills , " reads the policy statement . <p> Perhaps the best rationale for avoiding TV is given by Jerry Mander in his 1978 book , " Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television " : The flashing lights of the TV put the viewer into a passive , hypnotic state . I want my kid engaged , not hypnotized into a glassy-eyed consumer ! <p> LISA TSERING <p> Oakland ( 1-2 ) / Illustrations by Lance jackson / The Chronicle
