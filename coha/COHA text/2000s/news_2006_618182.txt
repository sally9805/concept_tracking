<p> In the world of high school football , a head booster 's work is never done  --  particularly when that booster happens to be a woman . <p> If she 's not passing out Popsicles or painting wet grass , Dana Doster , president of the South Gwinnett High School Touchdown Club , is hanging ads on the stadium wall , ordering takeout pizza for the whole team , or organizing a golf tournament fund-raiser she does n't even play in . ( I get too angry playing Putt-Putt golf , " she said . ) <p> " It 's a full-time volunteer job , " Doster said . " But I would n't do it if I did n't love it . " <p> A graduate of the school to which she now gives practically every minute of her spare time , Doster is aware that she has taken on a traditionally male role in the football program . Being a woman only comes into play , she said , when she has to remember when to stay out of the locker rooms . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she does things like making sure there are plenty of snacks in the football field house . However , she 's not hesitant about jumping behind the wheel of an ATV to haul equipment around the field and she 's learned to watch game film with a coach 's eye . <p> Breaking stereotypes is just an unintended consequence of her taking the job , she said . There was a need for someone willing to tackle the seemingly endless to-do list that comes with the presidency of the Comets ' booster club , and Doster said " yes . " <p> Her biggest reason for accepting was her affection for the Comets athletes , she said . <p> " I 've followed some of these kids since youth league ball , " she said . " They 're like my own kids . I love them . " <p> For others in the South Gwinnett football program , Doster 's gender is largely irrelevant . <p> To coach John Small , what 's most important is that Doster is a " true blue Comet . " ( The school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a great choice , " Small said . " She 's a go-getter and a tireless supporter of the program . " <p> Terry Hollis , Doster 's immediate predecessor , said he had no reservations about nominating Doster to take his place . " Dana does n't mind getting out and banging on doors , " he said . " She 's really good at getting people to help out . " <p> Doster 's presidency broke with an unofficial policy which held that the head of the booster club should not have a son playing on the team , Hollis said . This was to avoid the perception that work in the booster club can translate to more playing time for the booster 's son , he said . <p> Doster 's son Chris is a a junior who plays linebacker and fullback , but Small said Chris Doster 's position on the depth chart was earned well before Dana Doster took over . " She lets us coach , " Small said . " I know she 's got my back and she 's looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Beyond Snellville , though , others see significance in Dana Doster 's presidency . <p> Peggy Johnson , president of the Georgia Athletic Director 's Association , said it is still too rare a sight to see a woman in a leadership role in a high school football program . " Someone had to think very highly of her Doster to give her that job . That 's going against the norm , " Johnson said . <p> That particular gender norm should be challenged more frequently , she said . <p> " It 's time , " said Johnson , who serves as athletics director at Savannah Arts Academy , part of the Chatham County public school system . " It 's not just a man 's world anymore . " <p> Charles Turner , past president of the AD 's association , said three different women headed the booster club , during the 15 years he was athletics director at Cedar Shoals High School in Clarke County . In most schools around the state , however , women served mostly by helping the men who ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there , " Turner said . " They may not have been in the lead for the most part , but they 've always been involved . " <p> Dana Doster was involved in athletics when she was a Comet , but it was as a member of the girls ' softball team . It was n't until after she was married that she caught husband Terry 's addiction to football . <p> While Terry coached their son Chris on youth league teams , Dana helped by scouting the opposition , taping games for Terry to study . He still coaches a team of eighth-graders in the park league that feeds into South Gwinnett , and he also serves as an assistant coach on the ninth-grade squad at the high school . <p> When her older daughter played basketball at South Gwinnett , Dana got involved by serving as the president of the Tipoff Club , which supports the girls and boys teams . <p> Her crossover to head the Touchdown Club seemed a natural transition , said Hildegarde Schmid , a club member who also nominated Doster for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's firm , " Schmid said of Doster . " She gets involved with the boys , and that 's what we 're supposed to be here for . " <p> Doster 's energy has reinvigorated the booster club , Schmid said , noting that meeting attendance has increased . <p> For herself , Doster is reluctant to accept credit for any of the program 's successes . She said she sees her role as continuing South Gwinnett 's tradition of community involvement in Comets football , and she is quick to note that it takes scores of vounteers to make that happen . <p> Nonetheless , she has tackled a man-sized commitment . <p> Doster said the Touchdown Club has about 125 dues-paid members and an annual budget of about $300,000 . Besides the dues , most of the revenues come from fund-raising events , some of which the athletes are required to participate in . <p> Most of the club 's funds are spent on things like team meals , equipment for producing player highlight videos , and paint for the extra touches like the star on the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just about every day  --  especially at this time of year  --  there is something that needs to be done . Doster works as a sales agent for insurance policies to churches and private schools , so her work time is flexible enough to allow her to be involved in most of the football season 's activities . <p> On Mondays , the Touchdown Club usually offers hot dogs to the players after practice . <p> Then there are Popsicle Tuesdays , when club members have Popsicles waiting for the players as they leave the practice field . <p> On Wednesday evenings , a volunteer crew lines and paints the field . This week , they started their work in a light rain , and their task was complicated by the fact that they use a water-based paint . They had to turn on the stadium lights to be able to be finished by 9 p.m . <p> Thursdays are team dinner nights , when the players and coaches eat together , either at a local restaurant or at the field house . In both cases , the restaurants usually donate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets immersed in Comets doings from late morning till late night , usually staying too nervous to eat much of that time . <p> For all that effort , Doster does not see herself as a groundbreaking woman in high school sports . She 'd much prefer to be seen as a Mom who came back to serve her alma mater . <p> DANA DOSTER 'S GAME DAY <p> 7 a.m.  --  Arise . Way too nervous to eat . <p> 7 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.  --  Work the day job . <p> 11:45 to 1 p.m.  --  Pick up cases of sports drinks and bananas at discount warehouse and deliver to Comets field house by noon .
