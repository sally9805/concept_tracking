Nicholas Kaharchek surveyed his seven new polo students moving across the sandy practice field . He grinned as he watched an especially entertaining female named Billie Pearce . In the four years since Nick had started the polo school , he 'd seen his share of companionable stable bunnies and eager polo groupies , but he 'd never seen anything like Billie Pearce . She was neither a stable bunny , nor a polo groupie , nor a rider , by any stretch of the imagination . From what he could determine during their brief conversation following the classroom part of the program , she was a housewife , smelling like fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies and looking good enough to eat in her brand-new black riding boots and cream-colored pants . A woman like that could make a man forget all his troubles . Well , almost . She had " girl-next-door " written all over her , what with those large hazel eyes and a mouth that was a smidgen too wide for her face . She was n't wearing a ring ; he 'd noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-rounded maturity and general satisfaction that he associated with a happy homemaker and motherhood . Not that he considered himself an expert on women , although , by God , he did his best . Nicholas Kaharchek knew horses . It was said he 'd inherited his horse sense from his Cossack ancestry . It was also rumored that the Cossack blood ran hot beneath the calm exterior of his personality -- a rumor many of the local ladies testified to be true . Nick had actually learned a lot about women while handling horses . He knew precisely what tone of voice to use on a high-spirited filly and how to lull even the most temperamental of them into a sense of well-being when startled . He knew how to move his hands just right over horseflesh -- slowly , deliberately , but feather-light , until the muscles quivered like those of a satisfied woman . Yeah , he knew how to play females , and the fact he had money -- lots of it -- did n't hurt . He genuinely liked women , enjoyed their individual uniqueness . He liked the way a woman smelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kiss on the back of her neck , the way she looked sitting across a candlelit table or lying naked on the thick rug in front of his fireplace . And women liked him . They liked being seen on his arm , the fact he was generous to a fault , and they liked the way he treated them . At least most of them . But Nick had a habit of moving on after only a few dates . Less complicated that way , and he was a man who did not like complications . He 'd learned the hard way . He caught sight of Billie Pearce and suspected he was wasting his time , at least as far as polo was concerned . She had about as much business on a polo field as he did at a Tupperware party . He had a feeling teaching Billie Pearce to play polo would be like spitting into the wind . Her horse ambled up to the red , white , and blue beach ball that served as the beginners ' game ball and stopped . His ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a huge horse sigh . The animal obviously had other places he 'd rather be . " Listen up , horse , " Billie said , " I 'm paying forty dollars for a morning of polo . Forty bucks , you got that ? That would pay for a pedicure . The least you could do is pretend to enjoy this . " The horse snorted . " My sentiments exactly , " she muttered . Billie aimed carefully at her beach ball , swung the mallet in a loop over her head , and completely missed her target . The mallet slipped from her grasp and hurtled halfway across the field . " Dammit . " Nick took in the sight with a mixture of disbelief and curiosity . The woman had absolutely no idea what she was doing , and she seemed to be lecturing a horse about polo , though sadly enough the horse probably knew more about the sport than she did . Still , she was cute in an old-fashioned way . She made him think of nice things : the way grass smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp sheets against his body , window curtains billowing in a soft breeze , and the smell of something nice baking in the oven . He retrieved her mallet and guided his horse to her side . " Mrs. Pearce , " he began in a patient voice , " there 's a little leather strap attached to the mallet . If you slip your hand through that strap , it will prevent you from slinging it across the field and committing involuntary manslaughter . " Billie felt a rush of embarrassment . She must look foolish to someone with his expertise , and it was n't easy taking criticism from a man who looked as though he belonged on the cover of GQ , what with his custom-made Argentine-style boots and polo wear that looked as though it had been tailor-made to fit what could only be described as the perfect body . She met his gaze . " Sorry , it was an accident . I was hoping this would be easier , but it 's all I can do to stay atop this horse . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick raised an eyebrow . " I seem to remember you wrote on your application that you 'd been around horses all your life . " " That 's right . " She was n't about to tell him the truth : that she 'd simply lived next door to someone who owned horses . " It 's , uh , been a long time . I 've gotten a little rusty . And the horses are shorter where I come from . " He nodded as though it made perfect sense , which it did n't . His saddle creaked under him as he put weight on his stirrups . " Mrs. Pearce , I do n't mean to discourage you from playing polo , but maybe it would be a good idea for you to take a few riding lessons first . To sort of get back into the swing of it . " Billie looked around and had to admit she was lacking . The other students were much more skilled at managing their horses . One woman in particular had caught her eyes , a stunning brunette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was n't a student ; that much was certain from her perfect posture , and an air of confidence that came from years of training . She and her horse moved across the distant riding arena with such fluidity it looked choreographed . Billie realized Nick was waiting for an answer . " The ad in the paper said you did n't need to be an expert rider , " she offered as explanation . " That 's true , but it helps if you know some of the basics . " Such as which end of the horse you 're supposed to face , he thought . Was this woman for real ? He glanced at his watch and moved his bay gelding away from her . " This session is almost over . Why do n't you take Zeke back to the barn and wait for me ? I 'll give you a lesson in tacking and horse care . " " Um , okay , sure . " Billie glanced down at the stubborn animal , wondering how to coax him toward the barn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Nick said . " Like this . " It looked easy enough . Billy very gently pressed both heels against the horse 's side , prodding him forward . Nick nodded his approval . He had to admit watching Billie Pearce was more interesting than anything else going on in the field at the moment . " That 's right . " Zeke ambled forward as Nick watched . Like most of the polo-school horses , Zeke had been donated . At one time he might have been the pride of the circuit , but he was retired now , and he took his retirement seriously . In his three years ' tenure at the school stable , he had never been known to move faster than a shuffle . Yet , despite being incorrigibly lazy , he was by no means stupid . If forced , he knew when to take the field , when to follow a ball , and when to return to the stable , the latter of which he managed at a faster pace . He carried Billie to the apron of hard-packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and came to a dead stop , jolting Billie forward . She grasped his mane to keep from falling off . Zeke craned his neck , giving her a look of pure disgust . Nick smiled and dismissed the class . Billie watched the other women guide their horses to the barn and dismount with ease . Stable hands appeared out of nowhere , took the horses , and led them inside the barn . A couple of the stablehands looked to be high-school age , obviously working summer jobs . An older man in a baseball cap appeared , and he barked orders at the boys as they rushed about in their work . Billie tried to block out the man 's harsh voice as she sat very still on the horse , waiting , because she had no intention of climbing off Zeke while there was another human being within a twenty-five-mile radius . She had no desire to further embarrass herself and give Nick Kaharchek more conversational fodder for his evening meal . The July sun was high in a cloudless blue sky , and the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Billie like a giant , undulating patchwork quilt of field and forest . Horses stamped their feet and whickered softly in their stalls . The air was heavy with the smells of horse , oiled leather , and baking straw , prompting Billie to think of her childhood in Lancaster , Pennsylvania . Her father had been a small-businessman , but they 'd lived side by side with Mennonite farmers . Good , sturdy people , who were n't afraid of hard labor . They revered their land and their marriages and worked to make them successful . Billie respected them for that , and she envied them because she 'd had to give up on her own marriage . She 'd had no choice . It took two people to make a relationship work , and her former husband had wanted no part of it . Her gaze shifted once more to the brunette woman and her horse , now moving at a faster gait , perfectly attuned to each other . Damn , but the woman was good . Her hair lifted and fell gracefully against her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would she ever be able to ride like that ? she wondered . Billie momentarily closed her eyes and enjoyed the feel of the sun on her back while she listened to the lulling buzz of cicadas singing in the distance . At least she 'd held on to the house after the divorce , she reminded herself , thinking back to her disastrous marriage . Her children might have to make do with a part-time father , but they sure as hell were n't going to lose their home and the sense of stability Billie had fought to give them . " Mrs. Pearce , what are you doing ? " Billie jumped at the sound of Nick 's voice . She watched in awe as he approached the stable on his own horse . He reminded her of a centaur , that mythical creature who was half-man and half-horse . His riding was so fluid it was difficult to distinguish where the man left off and the horse began . He was as skilled as the woman she 'd been watching . Billie envied them both . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could give me my lesson , " Billie said , trying to avoid looking directly into his brown eyes or noting how the sun had bronzed his olive complexion . She did not need to be caught up by his good looks . Kaharchek was definitely not her type . The silent declaration drew her brows together in a frown as she pondered exactly what kind of man would be her type . Well , there was that chemistry teacher with the tortoiseshell glasses who 'd made it plain months ago that he was interested . She suspected he would already have asked her out had she returned his interest . And the manager of the Kroger store made it a point to speak to her several times when she was in the store , pointing out various sales , saving coupons for items he knew she purchased with regularity . But she had n't given either man much thought , because she simply did n't have a lot of time for romance , what with teaching , her children , housework , and gardening , and the list went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to squeeze in a little time for a man , it certainly would n't be for someone like Nicholas Kaharchek . For one thing , they had nothing in common . His father had amassed a fortune in his lifetime and provided well for his only son . It was common knowledge that when the elder Kaharchek had retired , Nick had been content to let a number of talented second cousins run the empire while he concentrated on raising horses and being a hands-on owner of Loudoun County 's most widely read newspaper . Billie respected the paper , but having heard rumors of Nicholas Kaharchek 's various liaisons , she was n't sure she respected the man . Nick dismounted and handed his horse over to a groom as he regarded her . " You can dismount now . " " Easy for you to say . " It amazed him how little she knew . " Just swing your right leg over the horse and hold on to the saddle with both hands . " She hesitated . " That sounds risky . " He saw the doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of horses ? " " Of course not . I 'm not afraid of anything . I killed a spider yesterday . It was big and black and hairy . " She suppressed an involuntary shudder . " Uh-huh . " " Okay , so maybe it was n't hairy , but there was a time I would n't have entered the same room with a spider . I 've grown , " she announced with aplomb . He just looked at her , and she suddenly felt dumb for mentioning the spider . Nick Kaharchek had probably never been afraid of anything in his life . " I just was n't expecting this horse to be so big , " she said , getting back to the subject at hand . " I feel like I should parachute from the back of this animal . " She took a deep breath , closed her eyes , and swung her right leg over the horse . The saddle slid through her grasping fingers , her arms flailed at the air . Nick reached for her , trying to break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-air , and fell against him . There was an exchange of grunts as they both hit the ground with a loud , bone-jarring thud . Somehow , she 'd managed to knock the man off his feet . Worse , she 'd landed right smack on top of him . On top of him , for heaven 's sake ! She simply lay there for a moment , sprawled across the polo god on the hard-packed dirt , breast to chest , zipper to zipper , thigh to thigh . Everything touching . Billie blinked and looked into Nick 's startled eyes . Lord , Lord , he would think she was an idiot for sure , and he would have every right . She had no idea what to do . How would Miss Manners suggest she extricate herself from such a delicate situation without making it worse ? All she could do was apologize profusely and hope he did n't press charges for assault and battery . If only the man did n't feel so good . She tried to remember the last time she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . All her nerve endings tingled , and something low in her belly tightened and coiled and sent a rush of pleasure through her . Lord , do n't let me go and do something stupid like have an orgasm right now , she prayed . " Sorry , " she whispered . " I lost my balance , and then my knees went weak . " " I know the feeling . " " Are you okay ? " Billie asked . " I hope I did n't hurt anything . " " Nothing I 'd want to tell you about . " She gave a mental wince . She 'd made a spectacle of herself in front of him and everyone else by flipping her mallet out like a Frisbee . Now she 'd gone and made a eunuch out of the most eligible bachelor in Loudoun County . " Well , now , " a feminine voice said . " Is n't this cozy ? " Billie glanced up . It was her , the gorgeous creature she 'd watched earlier . Only the woman was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years younger than Billie , but her skin was flawless , as though she pampered it on a regular basis . Nick looked in her direction . " Hello , Sheridan . " The woman tossed Billie a look . " I see Nick has taught you how to dismount . " She had the smile of a movie star . Billie decided somebody had spent a fortune on braces . She searched for her voice . " This is my first lesson . " " I would never have guessed . " Billie suddenly felt small as she took in the mocking smile . Sheridan was the kind of woman who made all other women feel as though they had a huge wart on their nose . Nick gestured . " Sheridan , meet Billie Pearce , my new student . Mrs. Pearce , this is Sheridan Flock , an old , uh , friend . " Billie nodded at the woman and carefully lifted herself to her feet . She made a production of brushing dust from her britches , too embarrassed to look at either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Flock , " she said , finally making eye contact with the woman , refusing to be intimidated . " I watched you riding earlier . You 're magnificent . " " I learned from the best . " Sheridan eyed Nick in such a way it was clear that horseback riding was n't all he 'd taught her . " I 'd best be running along , " Billie told Nick . " Not so fast . Your lesson is n't over . " Sheridan pressed her lips together in annoyance . " Oh , let the poor girl go , " she said . " Ca n't you see she 's had enough for one day ? Why , it 's obvious she 's not cut out for this sort of thing . " Billie immediately stiffened , but her voice was pleasant when she spoke . " It 's true I 'm not as adept as you , Miss Flock , but then , we 're not in competition , are we ? " Sheridan 's smile faltered , but she pretended to ignore Billie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks , and this is the first chance I 've had to ride Clementine . Daddy has been entertaining nonstop since I arrived , so I 've been forced to play hostess . I thought we might go riding like old times . " Nick wore no emotion . " I ca n't , Sheridan . I 'm working . " " You call that work ? " She laughed . " Besides , you 're the boss . You set your own hours . " " Sorry , I 'll have to take a rain check . " Their gazes locked . Billie felt like an intruder . Finally , Sheridan dismounted and handed over her horse to a waiting groom . She left without comment , although Billie sensed her anger , boiling inside . Billie looked at Nick and noted the strange twist to his lips . " Are you laughing at me ? " " This is called a grimace . " Nick demonstrated while he talked . " Let 's start with the basics . Now , this is a saddle . " Billie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was taking up his valuable time . No telling what was going on back at the house , and seeing Sheridan again after all these months had left him shaken . He had enough problems , and Billie Pearce was only adding to them . " This is a stirrup . " " Mr. Kaharchek --  " " Pay attention . Now , you slide it up snug against the saddle like this . This is a girth . You unhitch the girth and the saddle slides off . You can take the saddle pads off the horse at the same time . " He motioned for a stable hand lurking just inside the barn . From the look on the kid 's face -- bafflement and amusement --  he 'd witnessed the whole thing . Nick avoided eye contact . Instead , he handed the saddle to the youth and in turn took a blue nylon halter from him . He pulled Billie toward Zeke 's head . " Always leave the reins over the horse 's neck while you 're removing the bridle . " He placed her hand behind Zeke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown piece . ' You gently slide it over the horse 's ears and --  " He paused when Billie 's face suddenly registered pain . Her face went white . " Something wrong ? " " He'sonmyfoot ! The dumb -- son -- of a horse -- is on my -- foot ! " She tried to shove Zeke , but it was like trying to move Mount Everest . Tears smarted her eyes . Nick reacted quickly ; one firm touch , and the big chestnut gelding calmly shifted away from Billie . She stared wide-eyed at her brand-new riding boot , perfectly branded with the imprint of Zeke 's hoof . She gasped in pain . " My foot is broken . It 's probably shattered . " She glared at the horse . Was she just imagining the smug expression ? She 'd seen that same look on Sheridan Flock 's face . " You did that on purpose , " she accused . She shot a glance at Nick . " He obviously finds it amusing . " Nick had to agree . It did look as though Zeke were smiling . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signaled for the hovering boy to take Zeke away and brush him down before putting him into his stall . " That 's not a damn bit funny , " Billie said as she watched the horse walk away with a jaunty sway of its hips . If body language was anything to go by , the animal clearly thought it was the victor in their little encounter . As for her , jaunty swaying was out of the question . She could n't put any weight on her foot . " I 'll never walk again , " she wailed . " Mrs. Pearce , please calm down . " Nick sighed . Just when he thought things could n't get worse . The woman was really hurt . She 'd probably managed not to sign a release form and would likely sue the pants off him . His insurance company would cancel . His polo school would be history . And she was hurt . That was the worst part . His protective instincts snapped alive . Her pretty eyes were swimming with tears she refused to shed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerent set to her chin , and decided she probably was brave , even if it did n't look that way at the moment . He scooped her into his arms and turned toward the barn . Her mouth popped open in surprise , but he felt her arms circle around his neck as though she realized she had no choice . She pressed against him for support . Just what he needed after having her fall full length against him , coming in contact with him in all the right places . He envisioned her children and their friends coming home at the end of the day to the smell of homemade cookies and tall glasses of milk . He envied them , wondered if they realized how lucky they were . Having been raised by one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the state , he 'd had little opportunity for warm , straight-out-of-the-oven cookies and cold milk . Billie shifted , and the soft material of her tank top brushed against his bare arms . She felt soft and curvy and feminine , a nice contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be thin enough . He owed Zeke a nice red apple . Damn . He had no business thinking how soft and warm Billie Pearce was . She had room mother and PTA spokesperson written all over her pretty face . She would never consider a three-day weekend filled with sun , fun , and great sex . She was different , and she would n't appreciate knowing he was aroused just thinking about her . Inside the barn , Nick plunked her down on a bench . " How does it feel ? " " Smushed . " " Smushed ? " Lord , she was talking like her sixth-graders . " How do you think it feels ? " she snapped . " It feels like a horse crushed it to smithereens . " " We have to get the boot off . " " Oh , no you do n't ! Not without ordering me a morphine drip . " He almost smiled . " Mrs. Pearce , I need to examine your foot . That means I have to pull off the boot . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me drawn and quartered . " Billie sucked in her breath and gripped the bench as he gingerly worked the boot off her injured foot . She closed her eyes , trying to remember the breathing techniques she 'd learned in Lamaze class years before as she prepared for labor and delivery when her children were born . She took a deep cleansing breath and concentrated on the top of Nick 's head . She wanted to touch it , run her fingers through the silky strands . It was the color of black coffee , thick , satiny , falling in lazy waves across his forehead and curling over his ears . Another deep breath . He probably had hair all over the place . Something fluttered in her stomach . She was delirious with pain ; that was the only excuse she could come up with for allowing her mind to run amuck with thoughts of his body . Another cleansing breath . She blew out through her mouth . " What are you doing ? " " Huh ? " Billie blinked and found Nick watching her curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered if he had a sense of humor . Not that the occasion called for it . " I 'm trying to get my mind off the pain . " His look softened . " I 'm sorry . " He eased the boot from her foot and peeled back her sock as she continued to grip the sides of the bench . She really was trying to be brave . He stood , hands on hips , and uttered an expletive . " It 's swollen . " " Imagine that . " Nevertheless , she was relieved to have the boot off . Her foot was beginning to swell and change color , seemingly right before her eyes . Not very attractive . Her only saving grace was that she had taken the time to paint her toenails the night before . That and the fact that Miss High-and-mighty was n't there to witness her second accident of the day . Who was she to Nick anyway ? Billie wondered . " It 's turning purple , " she said . Nick shook his head . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to drive . Someone was going to have to take her to the hospital to get the foot X-rayed . He could ask Arnie Bates , the older stable groom , but the man 's disposition had soured considerably since Nick had caught him smoking in the stable , something that was forbidden . The only reason Nick had n't fired him on the spot was that Arnie 's wife was pregnant , and they needed the money . And because Arnie had needed a break . Someone was going to have to take her home as well , Nick reminded himself . He felt his stomach sink at the possibility that it would , most likely , be him . He could already hear himself volunteering . Not that he was averse to being in the company of a beautiful woman , but he had his own worries -- his cousins . Deedee was alone in his house , and Max was wandering about the property , up to God knew what . Nick almost preferred having Zeke step on his foot to leaving the pair unsupervised . Deedee was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was n't dangerous . Not like Max . Nick glanced at his watch . Eleven o'clock . Chances were , Deedee was still sleeping . He 'd left her a full pot of coffee . Everything should be fineunless she decided to make herself lunch . Slim possibility , he decided . It would n't occur to her to prepare her own food , even if she ate on a regular basis , which she did n't , because she was more interested in keeping her model 's figure . Max , on the other hand , was hiding out and could do a lot of damage if left to his own devices . Nick gave a weary sigh . He would simply have to take his chances where the boy was concerned . At least for now , since there did n't seem to be any choice in the matter . " You 're not going to be able to drive with that foot and you need to see a doctor . " Arnie started past them . " Can you cover for me for a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pearce to the emergency room . " The other man glanced at Billie 's foot . " Yeah , sure . " Billie did n't think the groom looked very happy about it . Nick reached for the boot , handing it to Billie , and , once again , lifted her in his arms . They exited the barn . " What 's his problem ? " she whispered , motioning to the stable groom . Nick shrugged . " He 's having a bad day . Do n't mind him . " Most of the students had left , with the exception of a few who still lingered , talking among themselves , probably comparing notes on their first lesson . Nick looked at the cars remaining in the field beside the barn . " Which one is yours ? " Billie fished in her pocket for her keys . " The green mini-van . " A mom-car , he thought . He could almost picture her with a van full of youngsters , laughing , their metal braces flashing in the sun . He was sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back seat . A simple hospital run , he told himself . They 'd be in and out in no time . Max would n't have time to do much damage . Maybe . In the meantime , Nick would take the first opportunity to convince Billie Pearce to give up polo . He had his hands full in more ways than one , and the last thing he needed in his life was a woman like Billie Pearce . Not even if he was a man who enjoyed a good challenge .
