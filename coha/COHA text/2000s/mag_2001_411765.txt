Section : Nation &; World Investigative Report It may not work . It will cost billions . Why missile defense is a done deal <p> It was a routine evening in the control room deep inside Cheyenne Mountain , near Colorado Springs , Colo. , where U.S. Space Command keeps its eye on the heavens . Then , just after 9 p.m. , alarm lights began flashing . Analysts scrambled . A computerized wall-size map showed the cause  --  U.S. spy satellites had detected the heat pattern of a rocket launch from North Korea . Space Command quickly notified the Pentagon and U.S. forces in South Korea . As it turned out , the launch was no surprise . U.S. intelligence agencies were expecting a missile test , and they had sent surveillance planes to monitor it . Technicians tracked the Taepo Dong 1 missile as it arced over Japan , then splashed harmlessly into the Pacific . <p> Within a few days , though , U.S. intelligence agencies discovered the North Korean launch was a big deal . The rocket carried a " third-stage " booster that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , to U.S. territory . Although the third stage fizzled , this was a profound moment : For the first time , a minor power had demonstrated the potential to reach out and touch America from afar with a ballistic missile . <p> It hardly mattered that the test was a failure . The missile never reached the outer atmosphere , so the North Koreans can not know if it would have survived the punishing re-entry . And the space for a potential warhead was so small that some U.S. officials dubbed it " the golf ball of death . " Still , that launch , on Aug. 31 , 1998 , revolutionized the missile defense debate . It effectively changed the question from whether to build a missile defense system to how to build it . <p> This week , President Bush will discuss a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to set aside constraints on missile defense imposed by a 1972 treaty , contending that September 's terror attacks show the need to counter a possible missile attack . " Had these people had ballistic missile technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for arms control and a leading missile defense advocate , " there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that they would have used it . " <p> But the terrorist attacks cut both ways in the debate over missile defense . What enemy needs intercontinental ballistic missiles , critics ask , when he can use commercial airliners as weapons of mass destruction or can launch deadly attacks by dropping anthrax-laden envelopes into a mailbox ? And now the nation is facing a difficult question of priorities : Should it spend billions of dollars to address its immediate vulnerabilities , or billions to counter a potential future threat from a foreign missile , or both ? The choice is made all the more difficult by a slumping economy that is sending the federal budget toward the red . " How can preparing for what might happen in 2015 possibly compete with preparing for next week ? " asks one intelligence official . <p> A U.S. News examination found that even before the attacks , there were significant doubts within the U.S. government 's intelligence and security agencies about the urgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence agencies believe terrorists are unlikely to acquire ballistic missiles . Instead , the threat is from so-called rogue nations like North Korea , which can be influenced by traditional diplomacy . <p> <p> CIA and Pentagon experts rate the probability of a missile attack against the United States as extremely low . They are far more concerned about a " backpack bomb "  --  a chemical , biological , or nuclear device smuggled into the country . <p> <p> Buried in classified documents , comments by parts of the intelligence community challenged several conclusions in a crucial 1999 intelligence report that upgraded the urgency of the North Korean missile threat . Dissenters say their views have never been aired because of political sensitivities surrounding missile defense . <p> <p> U.S. intelligence experts have pushed back the timetable on North Korea 's missile development over the past two years , although this has not been made public . <p> Early in his term , President Bush outlined an ambitious plan for a missile defense system , envisioning a futuristic arsenal of land , sea , air , and space weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological challenge , say Bush aides , is the same as that of the Apollo moon landing and the Manhattan Project , which produced the atomic bomb . The comparison is apt in another respect : Preliminary estimates suggest that the cost of Bush 's plan will certainly top $100 billion and could easily hit $200 billion  --  more than the inflation-adjusted cost of the Manhattan Project and the moon landing combined . <p> In some ways , missile defense is President Bush 's other faith-based initiative  --  growing out of a conviction that science will overcome profound technological hurdles . In a defense bill still awaiting debate in Congress , Bush is asking for a massive increase in spending for missile defense . But critics contend the plan will break the usual rules for government programs by moving ahead with unproven technology to build a system that has n't been designed yet  --  all of which is a formula for huge delays and cost overruns . <p> National missile defense has an undeniable appeal . In fact , many Americans believe  --  wrongly  --  that the United States already has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s and 1960s gave way to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty , in which Washington and Moscow agreed to forgo large-scale defenses and rely on simple deterrence . President Reagan revived the cause when he proposed to break the ABM treaty and shelter the entire nation with a massive shield , a plan quickly dubbed Star Wars . <p> Interest waned after the collapse of the Soviet Union , yet dreams of missile defense were kept alive by a core group of Republican believers , who began talking about rogue nations and terrorists . They found an unexpectedly powerful weapon in a panel of defense experts led by the man who would become defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld . The Republican-led Congress had created the Rumsfeld commission out of anger at a 1995 " national intelligence estimate , " which concluded that no country other than Russia or China was likely to develop long-range ballistic missiles before 2010 . NIEs , which represent the consensus view of the intelligence community , are supposed to provide the basis for national security planning , and conservatives feared the CIA was downplaying the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and virtually everybody else knew that the 1995 NIE was criticized because it did n't meet the political need to display a threat , " says Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes , then head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . <p> One-two punch . When the bipartisan Rumsfeld report was released , its conclusions were alarming : North Korea and Iran could develop long-range missile capabilities in as few as five years and with little warning . The panel also blasted the CIA 's 1995 analysis . The timing was exquisite : Forty-seven days later , the North Koreans tested their big new missile . <p> At any other time , the impact of this one-two punch might have been temporary . ( After all , thanks in part to U.S. diplomacy , the North Koreans have yet to run another test . ) But this was the bizarre and politically charged year of 1998 . The United States was reeling from terrorist attacks on two U.S. embassies by Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda network and from allegations that China stole U.S. missile secrets . A distracted Clinton administration was embroiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , missile defense was not the kind of issue that anybody was eager to oppose . <p> Taking the heat . The intelligence community , meanwhile , was still smarting from criticism of the 1995 NIE and its subsequent failure to predict India 's nuclear test . So when the 1999 NIE was released , it unsurprisingly followed the Rumsfeld report 's lead . It acknowledged that North Korea , Iran , and possibly Iraq could develop long-range missiles within 15 years  --  but added that the nonmissile threat from weapons of mass destruction was more serious . " They did n't have new information , " says Lee Feinstein , a former State Department official who worked on nonproliferation . " They felt a lot of political pressure from Congress . " The supervisor of that NIE disagrees , insisting the updated estimate was more rigorous than the old one . " We invested a helluva lot of time assessing the technological capability irrespective of motivation and intention , " says John Gannon , then head of the National Intelligence Council , which drafts the NIEs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community disputed the conclusions that the North Koreans had the know-how to build a missile before 2010 . " We had valid objections , " says one former intelligence official , " but it was not possible to roll this thing back . " In fact , the classified version contains numerous dissenting footnotes from the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research and other agencies that were omitted from the unclassified summary , including ones about the odds of inducing North Korea to abandon its missile program through diplomacy . <p> Many missile experts also remain skeptical about the shift . For one , the standard was implicitly changed from what was likely to what was merely possible . The new estimate also set aside questions about the complex infrastructure needed to support a missile launch . " Suddenly , " says former U.S. arms control official Janne Nolan , " missile accuracy does n't matter . Command and control do n't matter . Missiles could just spring out and be launched . Range became the only criterion . " U.S. News has also learned that in subsequent classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea 's weapons development . <p> Still , the 1999 estimate in effect sealed the political debate on the fate of missile defense . " For people who were not enthusiastic about missile defense , there was nowhere to hide , " says one former Clinton administration official . Not long after , Clinton announced his vision of a limited land-based system aimed at a rogue missile threat . But only one of the first three tests was successful , and he deferred any deployment decision to his successor . <p> President Bush has wasted no time . Defense Department planners are now working on a more expansive  --  though still undefined  --  system that would involve land-based rockets , missile-firing ships , satellites , and lasers shot from 747s circling high above enemy territory . <p> Bush aides refuse to be pinned down on what the proposed system might look like , but they are attempting to make a strategic shift from a " threat-based " defense strategy to a " capabilities-based " strategy . " Instead of focusing on who our next adversary might be or where a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must focus on how an adversary might fight , and develop new capabilities to deter and defeat that adversary . " But any threat assessment requires making tough tradeoffs . " Every dollar you spend on missile defense is a dollar less you can spend on other defense needs , " says Democratic Sen. Jack Reed from Rhode Island . <p> Few defense experts doubt the gravity of the threat from weapons of mass destruction . Missiles are an obvious way to deliver these weapons . There is broad support for theater missile defense systems ( like the Patriot system used in the Gulf War ) to protect U.S. forces abroad from short-range missiles . The controversy is over whether these weapons would ever be delivered on long-range missiles against the U.S. homeland  --  and consequently over the need for elaborate defenses . <p> Rogue threat ? Missile technology is clearly spreading to nations like Iraq or North Korea . But even if a rogue state were to develop a functioning ballistic missile , would it choose to actually use it ? Such an attack would almost certainly trigger an overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News has learned that a confidential State Department study prepared for the agency 's senior leadership last year concluded that the U.S. arsenal would in fact deter rogue leaders . Much of the intelligence community agrees . " In terms of scenarios for long-range missiles , no one has come up with anywhere they would use them , and that make sense , " says one U.S. intelligence official . <p> A missile launch would provide an instant " return address . " One Capitol Hill expert says , " The most frustrating thing after September 11 is that we do n't know where to target these people . If they had shot a missile , we would have had them in 20 minutes . " The attacks have brought into sharper focus American vulnerabilities to far less traceable approaches than a missile strike . A nuclear warhead , for example , could be slipped into the country aboard a cargo ship and detonated . Says Owen Cote , an MIT national security expert , focusing so heavily on a missile shield " is like building a $100 billion lock for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of your house . " <p> The Bush team clearly fears the missile capabilities of rogue nations like Iraq or North Korea . " We are probably already vulnerable , " says one Bush administration official . But when pressed , Bush aides admit they are more concerned about the presence of missiles than an actual attack . By possessing a long-range missile , a rogue state might limit America 's freedom of action in defending allies around the world . For instance , a leader like North Korea 's Kim Jong Il might feel emboldened to mount an attack on South Korea if he could hold off American intervention with the threat of a missile strike against the United States . " You always have to ask yourself , Why are countries building ballistic missiles that could threaten the United States or our allies ? ' " says J. D. Crouch , assistant secretary of defense for international security policy . " They 're building them , I think , principally because they want to have leverage over the United States . " A senior administration official puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to deter us . " <p> China syndrome . If rogue states with a handful of missiles are the sole threat , many experts question why the Bush missile defense plan is so ambitious and expensive . " You ca n't justify the full range of what they 're doing with the rogues alone , " says Barry Blechman , a defense expert and former member of the Rumsfeld commission . Many suspect an additional factor : " I think there is an unstated third emerging threat that the system is being developed for . That is China 's ballistic missile capabilities , " argues Kurt Campbell , the Pentagon 's top Asia expert during the Clinton administration . <p> Whether or not it 's built for China , a missile shield could still have unintended consequences . A Chinese missile buildup is now nearly taken for granted . But a classified NIE written last year warns that such a development could have a domino effect throughout the Asian subcontinent , with India building up its arsenal to counter the Chinese threat , and Pakistan responding to keep pace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting aside the ABM treaty might soothe Russia 's long-standing fears about a U.S. missile shield . But Bush 's flexibility in negotiating with Russia has been limited by his ambitious timetable . The administration wants to deploy rudimentary ( and not fully tested ) interceptors in Alaska before 2004 , a date which many believe is motivated more by political than security concerns . Republican supporters " feel that if Bush does n't get re-elected , their dream will die , " says Lawrence Korb , a senior defense official during the Reagan administration . " The rush is to . . . deploy something by 2004 so there is no turning back . " <p> The current debate is one of priorities . And in the wake of September 11 , there are even more demands on the defense budget than before . Says Steve Andreasen , the director for arms control issues on the Clinton White House for eight years , " It 's not whether to defend America ; it 's how . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BLASTOFF . A Minuteman II missile carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : SUMMIT PREP . Rumsfeld and Putin discuss missiles . <p> Missile defense 101 : Vision and realities <p> To defend against a possible missile attack on the United States , the Bush administration is exploring an ambitious array of defenses that might involve land- , sea- , air- , and space-based elements . The system can be divided into two general techniques : midcourse and boost-phase . Some limited testing has been underway , but many components remain on the drawing board . Critics of missile defense argue that the technological hurdles are simply too great for the system ever to function reliably . Supporters concede the challenge but insist that significant advances have already been made and that with enough research , the system will be able to defeat a limited missile attack . Method One : In Testing Midcourse interception <p> Most of the missile defense tests so far have been designed to intercept a missile in the middle of its flight path . While this technology is furthest along , midcourse interception remains an extremely difficult technical challenge . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two techniques and that simple countermeasures could subvert a midcourse system . Elements of the System TABLE * Satellites detect a missile launch and send the information to a command center . One key system will eventually be upgraded with an infrared capability to detect launches earlier , while the other remains under development . * Early-Warning Radar systems scan specific but large areas of the sky and lock onto the missile , tracking it after its launch . These are especially important before the infrared satellite system is completed . @ X-Band Radar uses advanced signal processing technology to determine the real target amid any decoys . Because this system is not yet in place , homing beacons were placed in test incoming warheads to help guide the kill vehicles . @ Interceptors are launched from ground stations after their targets are identified . Their initial trajectories are determined based on the data from satellites and radar . @ Closing in , the kill vehicles separates from the booster and approaches the target , still relying on the ground control trajectory updates . * Discrimination between the warhead and decoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 miles from its kill vehicle switches to onboard sensors will guide it to the correct target warhead . Destruction of the warhead results from the impact of the kill vehicle , which is not armed with any explosives of its own . Countermeasures <p> Incoming missiles are often equipped with some sort of decoy to confuse a potential interceptor . Shown below are balloons that the missile could release in flight . But there is intense debate between missile defense critics and advocates over how easily missile defenses could overcome countermeasures . <p> Critics believe it is easier to design countermeasures than to defeat them . Put differently , countermeasures will be one step ahead of a kill vehicle 's ability to distinguish warheads from decoys . Tests so far have used only the most rudimentary countermeasures . <p> Advocates acknowledge the tests need to be more realistic , but they say that engineers will be able to design systems to overcome simple countermeasures . Countries like North Korea , they believe , are not capable of designing sophisticated decoys . <p> The critical moment comes when the kill vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With information from ground-based radar systems , it must quickly distinguish the real warhead package from balloon decoys that could be released . It if can distinguish the real target , it navigates itself toward the warhead , destroying it upon impact . <p> The decoys work because in space , the Mylar balloons move at the same speed as the warhead , which is encased in its own balloon . The decoy balloons can be heated to confound attempts at detecting the heat of the real warhead . However , decoy technology is difficult to implement , and it is not always successfully deployed . Testing hurdles <p> While some of the military 's midcourse tests have been successful , they have contained several artificial elements . <p> <p> Beacons in the missile help guide the interceptor in place of a planned radar system . <p> <p> Tests have not included missiles with multiple decoys or chaff . <p> <p> They have not yet tested the system against a less sophisticated missile that might tumble to Earth ( rather than fly smoothly ) , which could confuse tracking systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet to be developed , this system garners wider support . It is designed to destroy a missile in the first minutes of its launch . At this point , a missile is burning very hot , presenting a better target for sensors . But the missile is traveling so fast that it outpaces current interceptor rockets . Certain countermeasures might also defeat the interceptor . <p> A One promising option is a laser-guided 747 that could fly near a hostile country and fire on a just-launched missile . <p> B Naval destroyers anchored offshore could also be equipped with powerful missiles ( although today 's ships would need significant alterations ) . <p> C Some missile defense supporters also envision eventually using satellites as a base for a laser defense systems that would have greater coverage . <p> Sources : Ballistic Missile Defense Organization , Center for Defense Information , Federation of American Scientists , Union of Concerned Scientists , Heritage Foundation , High Frontier ; Graphic by Stephen Rountree  --  USN &WR; Reporting by Stephen Rountree , Mark Mazzetti , and Kevin Whitelaw  --  USN &WR; <p> DIAGRAM : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Method Two : On the Drawing Board : Boost-phase interception <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>
