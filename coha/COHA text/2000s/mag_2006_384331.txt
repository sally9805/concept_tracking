" * During sex , try to psychically tell your guy where to touch you next . Did he guess correctly ? * Reminisce about a great sexual experience the two of you shared , then ask your partner to guess which encounter you 're envisioning. * Close your eyes and try to perceive what images or sounds were in your partner 's head the last time you made love . It 's okay if you feel a little goofy doing these activities . You may not end up having ESP , but you 'll have fun trying-which is the whole point ! hear CREATE A SENSUAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CD or classic rock , hot music most definitely leads to hot sex , " Luadzers says .

Choosing a mix of tempos-from slow ballads to harder , faster tracks-will inject variety into the rhythm of your lovemaking , too . JUST BREATHE " Listening to your lover 's breath during sex helps you tune into the rhythm of your bodies , " says DooLittle . Press your cheek to his so his lips are next to your ear , and listen to his breathing rate increase as you make love . Match each other 's breathing to connect on a higher plane . LISTEN UP Sharing an iPod during lovemaking , helps you shut out the rest of the world and simply focus on the eroticism of the moment . " I surprised m my husband by wearing my iPod to bed and loading it with slow soul jams , " says Alexandria , 34 , of Los Angeles . " I 'd bought a headphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphones to listen to . He was so turned on , it was obvious his ears were a big erogenous zone ! " SAY THE WORD Telling your partner how hot he makes you or exactly what you 'd like him to do to you amps up arousal for both of you , says Kerner . It does n't have to be pornworthy dialogue-try simply saying stuff like , " Mmm ... that feels so good " or " Do you want me to do this harder ? " If you 're uncomfortable or shy about putting your intimate feelings into words , start small-classic one-liners like . " Oh ! " and " Yes ! " and " Oh , yes ! " will do the trick . SHARE A BEDTIME STORY " Sexy talk can be a turn-on , but for some people , talking dirty can feel too explicit or embarrassing , and actually be a turnoff , " says Locker . " That 's why listening to an erotic book on CD can be so sexually liberating . " ( You can search for and download hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and words are turning you on , you can enjoy all the arousal yet suffer none of the embarrassment .

She suggests feeding each other strawberries during sex-because biting into a plump , juicy strawberry is a sensual experience all on its own . " The flavors burst in your mouth , resulting in a moment of extreme pleasure , " Edlen-Nezin says . As a bonus , strawberries are full of antioxidants and promote circulation-which means more blood will flow to your genitals , improving arousal . SWEETEN THE DEAL There are tons of erotic chocolate sauces on the market these days , but Luadzers says plain old Hershey 's Syrup will do the trick . Paint it on with a soft brush . ( Worried about the mess ? DooLittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bed . ) KISS AGAIN When you two were first dating , kissing was the main event . It 's time to get back to basics ! Share a deep French kiss for at least 10 minutes before going any further , and enjoy the taste of his lips , his mouth , his tongue . ( Advanced fun : Use your tongues to pass a candy , piece of fruit , or even a sip of wine from mouth to mouth . ) TRY FOOD AS FOREPLAY When you think of aphrodisiac foods , you probably think of oysters . But Martha Hopkins , coauthor of Intercourses : An Aphrodisiac Cookbook , says some of the best aphrodisiacs are often overlooked : " The avocado mimics the curves of a woman 's body , and has a wonderful buttery texture . Asparagus is a classic phallic symbol , and has been used throughout history to enhance sexuality . And pine nuts , especially when toasted , can be a real libido booster . " Try recipes that incorporate these foods ( such as guacamole , steamed asparagus , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes at dinner to put you both in the mood for love later .
