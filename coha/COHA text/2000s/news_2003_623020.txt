<p> We needed beach and we needed balmy . And a good enchilada . <p> I do n't care how unnaturally lovely this Bay Area winter has been . I wanted the sun , food and culture of Southern California . So a friend and I hopped a short and surprisingly cheap flight to the beaches and Mexican food of San Diego . We had one set of ground rules : There would be no zoo visits and no creatures named Shamu . <p> The minute we stepped off the plane and started our way through the refurbished San Diego airport , we could feel the sun and smell the sea . The basic cotton turtleneck , so useful in San Francisco , was a bad decision  --  especially during the tricky bit of navigation required to retrieve luggage . The airport enjoyed a $238 million expansion in 1997 , but you would n't know it from the maddening human tangle at the baggage claim . <p> Spiffing up seems to be a theme in San Diego these days . The whole city got a spit-polish over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing in hundreds of new hotel rooms . Although this is a big convention town , many of those rooms need occupants now . That means several decent air and hotel packages are relatively easy to find on the Internet . <p> We wanted a simple plan that let us fly in , hit the beach and go home relaxed . So we opted for a room high in the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina on tiny , man-made Harbor Island in the San Diego Bay . Sheratons are sort of like Starbucks ; of course a boutique neighborhood coffee shop is better , but sometimes the consistency and convenience of Starbucks is simply easier . The hotel was so close to the airport that we could walk to the front door if we had to . We could see planes take off and land , but we could n't hear them . And just a small shift in our sight line from our balcony provided a better view  --  of palm trees , boats and miles of calm blue water . <p> The location had a couple of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , featuring a hot tub and three bronze dolphins shooting water from their snouts , snaked though a courtyard just outside a marina full of boats . And it was close to plenty of places we wanted to go . <p> It was a short drive to the Gaslamp Quarter , a restored Victorian district downtown with clubs , art galleries and trendy little restaurants spread out on 16 blocks in the shadow of the city 's big waterfront hotels . When we were searching for dinner recommendations and people found out we were serious foodies from Northern California , they sent us there . The area was a little Disney-esque , but the artichoke wonton ravioli and braised short-rib salad at the urban , upscale Chive restaurant did make us feel like we were home . Still , fussy modern food was n't why we came to San Diego . <p> Finding a great beach is easy . From the wilds of Torrey Pines and the spectacular cliffs of Blacks Beach ( the area 's nude hangout ) several miles north of the city , public oceanfront stretches south to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as likely to be offered a bong hit as to get a tan . You can get to many of San Diego 's beaches by bus , but who wants to cruise the beach on public transportation ? Rent a car and you can explore the beaches and , as we did , find some amazing little Mexican dives in this city of 1.1 million . <p> We started with the beaches that rim the tony community of La Jolla , where the people are beautiful and the shops filled with dresses that cost more than our entire tab for the hotel and flight . The prettiest and most-photographed beach in San Diego is La Jolla Cove . The sand is coarse , the sandstone cliffs offer a sense of isolation and surfers love it here . The beach is within the San Diego La Jolla Underwater Park , and divers find plenty of marine life . <p> We wanted a close-up view of some of that marine life , so we battled for parking around nearby Casa Cove . It 's also called the Children 's Pool , because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see a single child . That 's because the beach was covered with seals and sea lions taking naps and barking their heads off . <p> We barreled south to the last beach along San Diego 's shore : Ocean Beach . Tourists do n't usually head here , unless they 're looking for a silver skull ring or a place to run a dog leash-free . The place has a funky appeal , from the string of surf shops ( though the surfing is n't great here ) to the people eating ice cream cones while walking the longest concrete fishing pier on the West Coast . The sand is n't as pretty as at La Jolla , but there are some killer tide pools right under the pier . And if you visit on a Wednesday , you can browse the nearby farmers ' market . <p> Of course , beaches make people want to eat fish , and the locals know to go to Point Loma Seafoods , a freewheeling fish market and restaurant on a tip of land that juts into the Pacific Ocean south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the back of the restaurant were a good sign , and the prices of the platters were even better . It 's easy to get distracted by the high , glass-enclosed coolers full of tuna steaks and local Pacific lobsters ( different from their Maine cousins by a lack of claw and an extra-big tail full of meat ) , but stay focused on lunch . You need to be ready to order the minute you get the attention of one of the people behind the counter . <p> A plate of fried fish and Pacific oysters later , we took off up the hill to visit the National Park Service monument to 16th century Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo . The park offers the best view of San Diego . Some 400 feet up on the cliffs of the Point Loma Ecological Reserve , with the sweeping Pacific on one side and San Diego and its bay on the other , the true beauty of the region is apparent . But the feeling can shift quickly . A fellow standing next to us near the Cabrillo monument pointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat nuclear subs waiting for repair . <p> The U.S. government has long viewed the San Diego area as a key defense stronghold , and as early as 1852 declared Point Loma a military reserve . It is tough to go anywhere in San Diego without seeing battleships , sailors or warplanes . <p> Now , about that Mexican food . One evening , after a great sunset at Sunset Cliffs above Ocean Beach , we wound our way to Old Town San Diego , a tourist draw that borders on Mexican kitsch . A state historic site with structures that date to 1829 , Old Town was the first Spanish settlement on the West Coast . On the corner of the main Old Town plaza is Bazaar Del Mundo , a mini-village with several restaurants surrounding a grassy town square . Locals say the food is good , and the whole thing would be downright quaint if it were n't for the gewgaw shops lining it . Although the mariachi band that plays some nights and the lanterns strung around the place add some charm , it was n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who was born and bred in San Diego directed us down the street to Old Town Mexican Cafe , where , she said , the locals go when visiting relatives force them into yet another trip to Old San Diego . <p> In the window outside what is basically a rollicking margarita and taco place , two women  --  " the tortilla ladies of Old Town "  --  stood rolling dough into balls , patting out corn and flour tortillas , and then tossing them on the grill with a quick , practiced flip of the wrist . Once you endure the inevitable wait for a table , order plenty of tortillas . They 're great for wrapping around carnitas , which can be ordered extra crispy . <p> The peak Mexican food moment came the day before we headed home . We sat down at El Indio , a Mexican restaurant tucked away between Old Town and downtown that started in 1940 , serving taquitos three for a quarter . You stand in line to order , but what it lacks in table service and ambience it makes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shredded beef , cheese enchiladas with perfect red sauce that can be purchased by the pint and steamy green chili tamales that are sweet and savory at the same time . Order extra chips ; people call El Indio from all over the country to get their thick , chili-dusted chips delivered . <p> The food was simple , inexpensive and satisfying  --  especially after all that sand and ocean . I ate at a table outside , feeling the warm night breeze . It was exactly the right way to end a Southern California weekend . <p> IF YOU GO <p> GETTING THERE <p>  --  Several major airlines fly direct from Bay Area airports .
