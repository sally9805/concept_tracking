Fruit sleuths and nursery owners are fighting to save our nation 's apple heritage ... before it 's too late <p> SIXTEEN YEARS AGO , WHEN I WORKED AT THE Planters &; Designers garden center in Bristol , Virginia , old-timers frequently came in and asked for apple varieties called Virginia Beauty and Yellow Transparent . I tried to look them up in fruit tree catalogs , but I could never find them . The more they asked me , the more intrigued I became . Though I came from a long line of nurserymen , I knew little about fruit varieties of the past , a subject called historical pomology . <p> Of course , that was before Henry Morton drove into the gravel parking lot at the garden center in the spring of 1988 . He was wearing blue jeans and a button-down shirt ; I figured he was a customer who had come to buy a rose bush and a bag of manure and be on his way . But Morton , a Baptist preacher from Gadinburg , Tennessee , slapped me on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to sell me a Limbertwig . A Limbertwig ? <p> " Limbertwigs vary in size , shape , color , quality and tree habit , " said Morton , " but they all have one distinguishing characteristic , and that is their distinct Limbertwig flavor . " I must have looked puzzled , so he told me that a Limbertwig was an old-fashioned apple . <p> It turns out that Mr. Morton spread not only the Gospel but some of the best-tasting apple varieties ever grown , many of them old lines or antique cultivars , rescued from the edge of extinction  --  varieties such as Moyer 's Spice , Walker 's Pippin , Sweet Bough , and Black Limbertwig . His 11- by 17-inch price list named some 150 varieties  --  including the Virginia Beauty ( $5 for a five-foot tree ) and the Yellow Transparent ( $5 ) . Our meeting was the beginning of a friendship that would add some poetry to my rootball-toting life . For I would taste these mouthwatering apples at Morton 's hillside nursery , and learn that the dark red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late keepers ( apple parlance for a variety that ripens late and keeps well into the winter ) you could ever sink your teeth into : sweet and juicy , with hints of cherry and almond . Yellow Transparent , also called June Apple , is almost white when fully ripe . Its light flesh cooks up in about five minutes and mattes exquisite buttermilk biscuits . Once I 'd sampled these old varieties , a Red Delicious or a Granny Smith never bore a second look . <p> Largely because of Morton , in 1992 my wife and I opened a small mail-order nursery that specializes in antique apple trees in general and old Southern apples in particular . We started buying stock wholesale from Morton and then reselling the trees . Not surprisingly , Virginia Beauty became one of our biggest hits . <p> Along the way I discovered the sheer magnitude of America 's long love affair with the apple . Today , only 15 popular varieties account for more than 90 percent of U.S. production . That was n't always so . By 1930 , Southerners alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 10,000 flourished nationwide . They came warts and all , some with rough , knobby skin , others as misshapen as a potato , and they ranged from the size of cherries to nearly as big as a grapefruit , with colors running the entire spectrum  --  flushed , striped , splashed and dotted in a wonderful array of impressionistic patterns . <p> Sadly , more than a thousand of these old Southern varieties are thought to be extinct . But Morton , who died a decade ago , and a handful of other hobbyists and independent nurserymen clung to the idea that many of these so-called extinct apple varieties might be living on , hidden from view in some obscure or overgrown orchard . Most of the apple trees platted in the past century , called old-time or full-size , can live 75 years or longer , even under conditions of complete neglect . The apple sleuths questioned elderly gardeners , placed ads in periodicals and , in time , discovered that more than 300 Southern apple varieties were still flourishing . Today , with most pre-World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running out to find other lost varieties . <p> WHEN MY GRANDFATHER , HIMSELF A retired nurseryman , learned of my interest in historical pomology , he handed me a manila envelope full of old fruit lithographs that had belonged to his father . " Dad sold fruit trees back in the ' 20s and ' 30s , he said . " These are from the plate book he used to carry . " <p> When I spread the images out on my grandmother 's pedestal kitchen table , it was as though my family tree were bringing forth fruit in its season . I marveled at the richly colored images of Maiden 's Blush ( waxen yellow with its cheek reddened toward the sun ) ; Black Ben Davis ( deep red , slightly conical , prized for its high-quality preserves ) ; Johnson 's Fine Winter ( orangy red , queerly lopsided  --  yet deemed the " imperial of keepers " ) . I would learn as well that my grandfather 's grandfather , C. C. Davis , started out in the nursery business back in 1876  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he propagated are now considered rare or extinct . <p> In the 19th century , fruit gardens were as common as vegetable or rose gardens are today . " Fine fruit is the flower of commodities , " wrote Andrew Jackson Downing , author of the 1845 Fruits and Fruit Trees of America . " It is the most perfect union of the useful and the beautiful that the earth knows . Trees full of soft foliage ; blossoms fresh with spring beauty ; and , finally ,  --  fruit , rich , bloom-dusted , melting , and luscious  --  such are the treasures of the orchard and garden , temptingly offered to every landholder in this bright and sunny , though temperate climate . " <p> This boast could not have been made 200 years before . When the first colonists arrived at Jamestown , Virginia , in 1607 , there were no cultivated fruit trees in America  --  save for a few scattered Indian plantings  --  only wild crab apples , cherries , plums and persimmons . Taking a bite into a persimmon , Capt . John Smith commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> How much Smith influenced the subsequent introduction of new fruits to America is unknown . What is clear is that many colonists brought seeds , cuttings and small plants on the voyage over from Europe . Among the first to take root here was the May Duke cherry , the Calville Blanc d'Hiver apple , the Moor Park apricot and the Green Gage plum . Over the course of the next 300 years , the New World would experience a virtual revolution in the number and quality of apple and other fruit varieties . <p> " The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add an useful plant to its culture , " Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1821 . But it was less this noble sentiment than necessity , and thirst , that propelled America 's early experiments with fruit . " The apple was not brought to this country to eat , but to drink , " says apple authority Tom Bufford , whose family has been growing them since 1750 . Jefferson 's six-acre North Orchard was typical of family farms of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm orchards averaged about 200 apple and peach trees each , bearing fruit for cider and brandy making , or for use as food for livestock . Farmers made applejack by placing fermented cider outside during the winter and removing the ice that formed , leaving a potent alcoholic liquid . <p> Unlike Europeans , most Americans did not have the luxury of propagating apple trees by cloning existing plants through budding or grafting . Grafting , which can be ex- pensive and is labor intensive , is the only practical way to duplicate the exact characteristics of the parent tree . ( It is done by joining a cutting , called a scion , to a rooted plant , called a rootstock . The scion grows and eventually bears fruit . ) The trees that colonists did bring over from Europe did n't do well in the harsher climate . As a result , most colonists planted apple seeds , which create haphazard results . " Apples have ... a dizzying mlange of inherited characteristics , " writes Frank Browning , a journalist for National Public Radio who penned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tree can produce a broad array of similar-looking apples whose seeds will produce ' daughter ' apple trees that have completely different shapes ... and create fruit with utterly different color , sweetness , hardiness , and shape . " This rich genetic heritage makes the apple the hardiest and most diverse fruit on earth . But propagating apples is unpredictable . <p> A tree grown from an apple core thrown over the back fence usually bears fruit of only passable or inferior quality . But every once in a while , an apple with unusual and desirable characteristics arises . That is what happened time and again in cider orchards of the 17th and 18th centuries , orchards which served , in effect , as vast trial plots for the improvement of imported Old World stocks . Thus emerged , for instance , the small Hewes ' Crab , possibly a cross between an apple of European stock and the crab apple , native to Virginia . In pressing the juice-filled Hewes ' Crab for cider , wrote Philadelphia farmer Henry Wynkoop in 1814 , " the liquor flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many of these pippins , as the tree seedlings were called , thrived . By the mid-1780s , Jefferson could boast in a letter from Paris to the Rev. James Madison : " They have no apples to compare with our Newtown pippin . " In fact , Virginia 's Albemarle County , which includes Monticello , enjoyed a lucrative trade in exporting the Newtown Pippin to England . <p> One of the first American texts on pomology was written by William Coxe and published in 1817 . A View of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees described " one hundred kinds of the most estimable apples cultivated in our country , many of them true natives . And in 1869 , Downing 's revised edition of Fruits and Fruit Trees ( edited by brother Charles , and even today considered the magnum opus of American pomology ) described nearly 2,000 different apples , pears , peaches , plums and a host of lesser-known fruits  --  most of American origin . <p> That was the world in which John Chapman , better known as Johnny Appleseed , spread goodwill and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ohio and Indiana during the first half of the 19th century . The eccentric but resourceful Massachusetts native scouted routes along which pioneers would most likely settle . He bought land along these routes , on which he planted seedlings , which he would willingly dig up to sell to arriving settlers . By the 1830s , Chapman owned a string of nurseries that spread from western Pennsylvania , across Ohio and into Indiana . He died owning 1,200 acres of land in 1845 . Chapman 's story is about " how pioneers like him helped domesticate the frontier by seeding it with Old World plants , " writes Michael Pollan in The Botany of Desire . " Without them the American wilderness might never have become a home . " Chapman 's frontier nurseries no doubt produced many valuable new apples . Perhaps a few of them even made it into W. H. Ragan 's USDA , Bulletin No. 56 , Nomenclature of the Apple , the essential reference for apple aficionados , which in 1905 cataloged more than 14,000 different apple varieties . <p> But the golden age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 20th century . Inexpensive railway shipping and refrigeration enabled orchards to transport apples year-round . Home orcharding declined as suburbs emerged . And when that quintessential mass-market apple , the patented , inoffensively sweet and long-lasting Red Delicious , took hold in the early 1920s , many high-flavored heirlooms were effectively cut out of the commercial trade . Today 's mass merchandisers tend to view apple varieties in terms of color , disease resistance , shelf life and their ability to be shipped long distances without bruising . Grocery stores often stock only one red , one green and one yellow variety , which usually means a Red Delicious , a Granny Smith and a Golden Delicious . And as any consumer knows , those big , beautiful and perfect-looking apples can often taste like sweetened sawdust . Still , the apple remains big business in this country : about 7,500 commercial apple producers in 36 states harvest a total volume of 48,000 tons , second in production only to China . The average American consumes some 16 pounds of fresh apples a year , making the apple second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit . <p> CREIGHTON LEE CALHOUN , JR. , OF PITTSBORO , NORTH Carolina , may be the most influential heirloom apple sleuth on the job today . A retired Army colonel with degrees in agronomy and bacteriology , Calhoun started collecting old apple varieties in the early 1980s . " Early on , it was sort of like a treasure hunt , " he says . " I 'd go knock on doors and ask : ' What kind of tree is that ? ' Most of the time the people would say , ' I have no idea , ' or ' Granny knew , but she died in ' 74 . ' " It took Calhoun two years to locate his first antique apple  --  a Southern variety called Magnum Bonum . In 1983 , he found an old North Carolina apple called Summer Orange , prized for making pies . Calhoun tracked another apple to a farm owned by E. Lloyd Curl in Alamance County , in North Carolina 's piedmont region . " Curl said to me , ' Yeah , back during the Depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They paid me 10 cents for every tree I sold , and this was one of the varieties the nursery had ; they called it the Bivins . ' " <p> Calhoun took a cutting from the tree and grafted it onto one in his backyard orchard . ( One of his backyard trees would eventually host 36 different varieties , each new scion grafted to a different limb . ) In 1986 , Calhoun came across a 1906 catalog from an old North Carolina nursery , which indicated that the Bivins was actually a New Jersey apple called Bevan 's Favorite . It originated before 1842 and sold in the South as a high-quality summer-eating apple . But like so many others , it was neglected and eventually disappeared ; if not for Calhoun , it might have been lost altogether . Eventually , he would rediscover almost 100 lost varieties : apples such as Chimney , Prissy Gum , Dr. Bush 's Sweet , Carter 's Blue ( retrieved from the National Fruit Trust in Kent , England ) , Clarkes ' Pearmain ( grown by Thomas Jefferson ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the conclusion that the South was losing an irreplaceable part of its agricultural heritage , " says Calhoun . So , beginning in 1988 , with the help of his wife , Edith , he poured his research into a book , Old Southern Apples , a veritable bible of old apple information . Calhoun is encouraged by the new interest that his book and the work of other antique apple sleuths have generated over the past several years . <p> " In the past five years , " he says , " people have been breaking out of the Red Delicious straitjacket and becoming more adventurous , seeking out and buying apples of different colors and flavors . " In Washington State , for instance , Red Delicious production has fallen 25 percent over the past five years as commercial growers plant less well-known varieties , such as Braeburn , Jonagold , Gala , Cameo and Pink Lady . <p> WHILE READING CALHOUN 'S long list of extinct varieties , I came across a reference to an apple called the Reasor Green , which I knew from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with surface discolorations known as flyspeck and sooty blotch . ( Nineteenth-century illustrators unabashedly recorded both beauty and blemish . ) But what really caught my eye was the source for Calhoun 's description : the 1887 Silver Leaf Nurseries catalog by my great-great-grandfather C. C. Davis . I had never seen a copy of the catalog , so I eventually got myself over to the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville , Maryland , to check it out . Wearing the required white gloves , I opened it gingerly and began reading my **25;981;TOOLONG " Prefatory " remarks . " We have greatly extended our operations , the past few years , " he wrote , " having confidence that the planting spirit already manifest will continue to increase till every table be fully supplied with wholesome refreshing fruits . " <p> Alas , his optimism would prove misplaced . Of the 125 apple , pear , cherry , peach and plum varieties he describes , only a handful  --  the Winesap and Rome Beauty apples , and the Bartlett and Kieffer pears  --  are still grown widely today . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now grow half of them in my nursery . <p> It is for me a very direct connection to the past . But some antique apple varieties live on in a more indirect form . Another old apple by the name of Rails Genet , for example , was a favorite of Jefferson 's . As the story goes , the third president obtained cuttings of it from his friend , Edmund Charles Genet , French minister to the United States , and gave some to local nurseryman Caleb Ralls . The subsequent Rails Genet variety soon became a popular apple in the Ohio Valley because of its late bloom  --  which allows it to weather late-season frosts . It was crossed by Japanese breeders with the Red Delicious , and the resulting apple , released in 1962 , went on to become the now commercially popular Fuji , which recently overtook the Granny Smith as the third most popular apple in the United States ( behind the Red Delicious and the Golden Delicious ) . As Peter Hatch , director of gardens and grounds at Jefferson 's Monticello , noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that Thomas Jefferson was not only the author of the Declaration of Independence and the father of the University of Virginia but perhaps the grandfather of the Fuji . " <p> My own great-great-grandfather would no doubt be proud to know that I am growing the " Rawle 's Janet " today  --  a variety that he , like many others of his time , misspelled . I suspect , however , that he would be even more pleased to know that I was able to propagate the Reasor Green in the spring of 2001 . For it was my great-great-grandfather , in 1886 , who introduced that very apple to the trade after he found it in a neighbor 's orchard . He grafted it onto existing trees and began selling cuttings , called whips . <p> Had I not read Lee Calhoun 's book , I probably would n't have given the Reasor Green much thought . But when I saw the word " extinct " next to what amounted to a family heirloom , I was motivated to get out of the nursery and see what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with family and any friends who might know where an old Reasor Green tree was still standing . And it did n't take long to get a hot lead . When I told my story to Harold Jerrell , an extension agent in Lee County , Virginia , where the Silver Leaf Nurseries had been located , he said , " Yeah , I know that one 's not extinct . " He recommended that I contact Hop Slemp of Dryden , Virginia . So I called Slemp , a beef and tobacco farmer , who said that he did have a Reasor Green and invited me to stop by for a visit the third week of October when the apples would be ready to pick . Would the Reasor Green  --  the regional pronunciation is Razor Green  --  turn out to be a " spitter , " an apple so bitter that it provokes a universal response ? Spitters , according to Tom Burford , make up a disappointing 90 percent of all heirloom apples . <p> On the appointed October day , my four sons and I headed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of southwest Virginia . By the time we pulled into Slemp 's gravel driveway , the sun was already low in the hazy , autumn sky . Buckets of apples were spread haphazardly in his carport . <p> After a few minutes , the 65-year-old Slemp pulled up in his Ford pickup . We piled into it , headed east for a quarter mile and turned onto a paved road that winds past scattered groves of tulip poplars and Virginia cedars . Finally , we pulled into a farm lane that had several apple trees planted beside it . Stopping at a heavy metal gate , we climbed out and inspected what Slemp calls an " old-timey Winesap , " loaded with dull red apples . I picked one off the tree and took a bite , luxuriating in the snappy , vinous flavor . Then we gathered a couple dozen more to eat later . <p> We got back in the truck and followed the lane a little farther up the ridge . " This here 's the Reasor Green , " Slemp said , pointing to a well-branched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been so dry , most of the apples have already dropped . Usually , this time of year , it 's loaded . " Sure enough , on the ground lay bushels of large green apples , mottled as promised with flyspeck and sooty blotch-dearly the very apple my great-great-grandfather propagated a century and a quarter ago . <p> What does a Reasor Green taste like ? <p> Well , I 'd love to slap you on the back and let you try one of these juicy apples for yourself . But short of your visiting southwest Virginia , that 's probably not going to happen . I can tell you , though , that after visiting with Slemp , we brought a whole bucketful of Reasor Greens home . And for my 39th birthday , my wife made two Reasor Green apple pies . It 's not enough to tell you they tasted like manna from heaven . I give the final word , instead , to my great-great-grandfather . The Reasor Green , he wrote 115 years ago , is one of those fruits " so beneficently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHERE YOU CAN FIND HEIRLOOM APPLES AND APPLE TREES Applesource TABLE Calhoun 's Nursery TABLE Greenmantle Nursery TABLE Sonoma Antique Apple Nursery TABLE Southmeadow Fruit Gardens TABLE Urban Homestead TABLE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : North Carolina heirloom apple detective Lee Calhoun has discovered almost 100 varieties thought to be extinct , including the Magnum Bomun ( nearest the prumers ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Calhoun tends some 450 apple varieties , more than four times the number commercially cultivated in this country . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The author 's great-great-grandfather C.C.
