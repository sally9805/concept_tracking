She had often dreamed of her little sister floating dead beneath the surface of the ice , but tonight , for the first time , she envisioned Hannah clawing to get out . She could see Hannah 's eyes , wide and milky ; could feel Hannah 's nails scraping . Then , with a start , she woke . It was not winter  --  it was July . There was no ice beneath her palms , just the tangled sheets of her bed . But once again , there was someone on the other side , fighting to be free . As the fist in her belly pulled tighter , she bit her bottom lip . Ignoring the pain that rippled and receded , she tiptoed barefoot into the night . The barn cat yowled when she stepped inside . She was panting by now , her legs shaking like willow twigs . Lowering herself to the hay in the far corner of the calving pen , she drew up her knees . The swollen cows rolled their blue moon eyes in her direction , then turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear witness . She concentrated on the hides of the Holsteins until their black spots shimmied and swam . She sank her teeth into the rolled hem of her nightgown . There was a funnel of pressure , as if she were being turned inside out ; and she remembered how she and Hannah used to squeeze through the hole in the barbed wire fence by the creek 's edge , pushing and angled , all knees and grunts and elbows , until by some miracle they 'd tumble through . It was over as suddenly as it had begun . And lying on the matted , stained hay between her legs was a baby . * * * Aaron Fisher rolled over beneath the bright quilt to stare at the clock beside the bed . There had been nothing , no sound to wake him , but afterforty-five years of farming and milking , the smallest things could pull him out of sleep : a footfall in the corn , a change in the pattern of the wind , the rasp of a mother 's tongue roughing a newborn calf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an elbow behind him , the long braid of her hair curling over her shoulder like a seaman 's rope . " Was ist letz ? " What 's the matter ? It was not the animals ; there was a full month before the first cow was due to deliver . It was not a robber ; there was too little noise . He felt his wife 's arm slip around him , hugging his back to her front . " Nix , " he murmured . Nothing . But he did not know if he was trying to convince Sarah , or himself . She knew enough to cut the cord that spiraled purple to the baby 's belly . Hands shaking , she managed to reach the old scissors that hung on a peg near the pen 's door . They were rusty and coated with bits of hay . The cord severed in two thick snips , and then began spurting blood . Horrified , she pressed her fingers to the ends , pinching it shut , wildly looking around for something to tie it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small length of baling twine , which she quickly tied around the cord . The bleeding slowed , then stopped . Relieved , she sank back on her elbows  --  and then the newborn started to cry . She snatched the baby up and rocked it tightly . With her foot , she kicked at the hay , trying to cover the blood with a clean layer . The baby 's mouth opened and closed on the cotton of her nightgown , rooting . She knew what the baby wanted , needed , but she could n't do it . It would make this real . So she gave the baby her pinkie finger instead . She let the small , powerful jaws suckle , while she did what she had been taught to do in times of extreme stress ; what she had been doing for months now . " Lord , " she prayed , " please make this go away . " The rustle of chains awakened her . It was still dark out , but the dairy cows ' internal schedule had them rising at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk , like full moons caught between their legs . She was sore and tired , but knew she had to get out of the barn before the men arrived to do the milking . Glancing down , she realized that a miracle had come to pass : the blood-soaked hay was fresh now , except for a small stain beneath her own bottom . And the two things she 'd been holding when she fell asleep  --  the scissors and the newborn  --  were gone . She pulled herself to her feet and glanced toward the roof , awed and reverent . " Denke , " she whispered , and then she ran out of the barn into the shadows . Like all other sixteen-year-old Amish boys , Levi Esch no longer attended school . He 'd gone through the eighth grade and was now in that limbo between being a child and being old enough to be baptized into the Amish faith . In the interim , he was a hired hand for Aaron Fisher , who no longer had a son to help him work his dairy farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older cousin Samuel , who 'd been apprenticing with the Fishers now for five years . And since everyone knew that Samuel was probably going to marry the Fishers ' daughter soon and set up his own farm , it meant Levi would be getting a promotion . His workday started at 4:00 a.m. , as on all other dairy farms . It was still pitch-dark , and Levi could not see Samuel 's buggy approach , but he could hear the faint jingle of tack and traces . He grabbed his flat-brimmed straw hat and ran out the door , then jumped onto the seat beside Samuel . " Hi , " he said breathlessly . Samuel nodded at him but did n't turn , did n't speak . " What 's the matter ? " Levi teased . " Katie would n't kiss you good-bye last night ? " Samuel scowled and cuffed Levi , sending his hat spinning into the back of the buggy . " Why do n't you just shut up ? " The wind whispered at the ragged edge of the cornfield as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the buggy into the Fishers ' front yard . Levi scuffed the toe of his boot into the soft earth and waited for Samuel to put the horse out to pasture before they headed into the barn . The lights used for milking were powered by a generator , as were the vacuum pumps hooked up to the teats of the cows . Aaron Fisher knelt beside one of the herd , spraying the udders with iodine solution and then wiping them dry with a page ripped from an old phone book . " Samuel , Levi , " he greeted . He did not tell them what to do , because by now they already knew . Samuel maneuvered the wheelbarrow beneath a silo and began to mix the feed . Levi shoveled out the manure behind each cow , periodically looking at Samuel and wishing he was already the senior farmhand . The barn door opened , and Aaron 's father ambled in . Elam Fisher lived in the grossdawdi haus , a small apartment attached to the main building . Although Elam helped out with the milking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man carried nothing heavy ; keep him from taxing himself ; and make him believe that Aaron could n't do without him , although Aaron could have , any day of the week . " Boys , " Elam boomed , then stopped in his tracks , his nose wrinkled above his long , white beard . " Why , we 've had a calf . " Puzzled , Aaron stood . " No . I checked the pen . " Elam shook his head . " There 's the smell of it , all the same . " " More like it 's Levi , needing a bath , " Samuel joked , emptying a fresh scoop of feed in front of the first cow . As Samuel passed him with the wheelbarrow , Levi came up swinging and slipped on a slick of manure . He landed on his bottom in the ditch built to catch the refuse and set his jaw at Samuel 's burst of laughter . " Come on now , " Aaron chided , although a grin tugged at his mouth . " Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left your spare clothes in the tack room . " Levi scrambled to his feet , his cheeks burning . He walked past Aaron , past the chalkboard with the annotated statistics on the cows due to calve , and turned into the small cubby that housed the blankets and bridles used for the farm 's workhorses and mules . Like the rest of the barn , it was neat as a pin . Braided leather reins crossed the wall like spiderwebs , and shelves were stacked with spare horseshoes and jars of liniment . Levi glanced about but could see no clothing . Then he noticed something bright in the pile of horse blankets . Well , that would make sense . If Sarah Fisher had washed his things , they had probably been done with the other laundry . He lifted the heavy , striped blanket and recognized his spare trousers and jewel green shirt , rolled into a ball . Levi stepped forward , intending to shake it out , and found himself staring down into the tiny , still face of a newborn . " Aaron ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron , you 've got to come . " He ran toward the tack room . Aaron exchanged a glance with his father , and they both started after the boy , with Samuel trailing . Levi stood in front of a stool piled high with horse blankets , on top of which rested a sleeping baby wrapped in a boy 's shirt . " I ... I do n't think it 's breathing . " Aaron stepped closer . It had been a long time since he 'd been around a baby this small . The soft skin of its face was cold . He knelt and tipped his head , hoping that its breath would fall into the cup of his ear . He flattened his hand against its chest . Then he turned to Levi . " Run to the Schuylers and ask to borrow their phone , " he said . " Call the police . " " Get out , " Lizzie Munro said to the officer in charge . " I 'm not going to check an unresponsive infant . Send an ambulance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lizzie rolled her eyes . Every year that she 'd been a detective-sergeant with the East Paradise Township police , the paramedics seemed to get younger . And more stupid . " It 's a medical call , Frank . " " Well , something 's out of kilter down there . " The lieutenant handed her a slip of paper with an address on it . " Fisher ? " Lizzie read , frowning at the surname and the street . " They 're Amish ? " " Think so . " Lizzie sighed and grabbed her big black purse and her badge . " You know this is a waste of time . " In the past , Lizzie had occasionally dealt with Old Order Amish teenagers , who 'd gather together in some guy 's barn to drink and dance and generally disturb the peace . Once or twice she 'd been called to take a statement from an Amish businessman who 'd been burglarized . But for the most part , the Amish had little contact with the police . Their community existed unobtrusively within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fluid around it . " Just take their statements , and I 'll make it up to you . " Frank held the door open for her as she left her office . " I 'll find a nice , fat felony for you to sink your teeth into . " " Do n't do me any favors , " Lizzie said , but she was grinning as she got into her car and headed to the Fisher farm . The Fishers ' front yard was crowded with a squad car , an ambulance , and a buggy . Lizzie walked up to the house and knocked on the front door . No one answered , but a voice behind Lizzie called out a greeting , the cadences of the woman 's dialect softening her consonants . A middle-aged Amish woman wearing a lavender dress and a black apron hurried toward Lizzie . " I am Sarah Fisher . Can I help you ? " " I 'm Detective-Sergeant Lizzie Munro . " Sarah nodded solemnly and led Lizzie into the barn 's tack room , where two paramedics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMT . " What have you got ? " " Newborn , emphasis on the new . No pulse or respirations when we got here , and we have n't been able to revive him . One of the farmworkers found him wrapped up in that green shirt , underneath a horse blanket . Ca n't tell if it was stillborn or not , but someone was trying to hide the body all the same . I think one of your guys is around by the milking stalls , he might be able to tell you more . " " Wait a second  --  someone gave birth to this baby , and then tried to conceal it ? " " Yeah . About three hours ago , " the paramedic murmured . Suddenly the simple medical response call was more complicated than Lizzie had expected , and the most likely suspect was standing four feet away . Lizzie glanced up at Sarah Fisher , who wrapped her arms around herself and shivered . " The baby ... it 's dead ? " " I 'm afraid so , Mrs. Fisher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was distracted by the distant sound of equipment being moved about . " What 's that ? " " The men , finishing up the milking . " Lizzie 's brows shot up . " The milking ? " " These things ... " the woman said quietly . " They still have to be done . " Suddenly , Lizzie felt profoundly sorry for her . Life never stopped for death ; she should know that better than most . She gentled her voice and put her hand on Mrs. Fisher 's shoulder , not quite certain what sort of psychological state the woman was in . " I know this must be very difficult for you , but I 'm going to have to ask you some questions about your baby . " Sarah Fisher raised her eyes to meet Lizzie 's . " It 's not my baby , " she said . " I have no idea where it came from . " A half hour later , Lizzie leaned down beside the crime scene photographer . " Stick to the barn . The Amish do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , shooting a roll around the tack room , with several close-ups of the infant 's corpse . At least now she understood why she 'd been called down . An unidentified dead infant , an unknown mother who 'd abandoned it . And all this smack in the middle of an Amish farm . She had interviewed the neighbors , a Lutheran couple who swore that they 'd never heard so much as raised voices from the Fishers , and who could n't imagine where the baby might have come from . They had two teenage daughters , one of whom sported a nose and navel ring , who had alibis for the previous night . But they had agreed to undergo gynecological exams to rule themselves out as suspects . Sarah Fisher , on the other hand , had not . Lizzie considered this as she stood in the milk room , watching Aaron Fisher empty a small hand tank of milk into a larger one . He was tall and dark , his arms thick with ropes of muscle developed by farming . His beard brushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set down the tank and turned to give Lizzie his full attention . " My wife was not pregnant , Detective , " Aaron said . " You 're certain ? " " Sarah ca n't have more children . The doctors made it that way , after she almost died birthing our youngest . " " Your other children , Mr. Fisher  --  where were they when the baby was found ? " A shadow passed over the man 's face , disappearing as quickly as Lizzie had marked it . " My daughter was asleep , upstairs . My other child ... is gone . " " Gone , like down the road to her own home ? " " Dead . " " This daughter who was asleep is how old ? " " Eighteen . " At that , Lizzie glanced up . Neither Sarah Fisher nor the paramedics had mentioned that there was another woman of childbearing age who lived on the farm . " Is it possible that she was pregnant , Mr. Fisher ? " The man 's face turned so red that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's not a prerequisite , sir . " Aaron Fisher stared at the detective coldly , clearly . " It is for us . " It seemed to take forever to get through milking all forty cows , and it had nothing to do with the arrival of a second battalion of police officers . Samuel closed the pasture gate after letting out the heifers and walked toward the main house . He should go help Levi sweep out the barn one last time for the morning , but this once it would wait . He did n't bother to knock . Just opened the door , as if the home was already his and the young woman inside at the stove also belonged to him . He stopped for a moment , watching the sun grace her profile and gild her honey hair , her movements quick and efficient as she fixed breakfast . " Katie , " Samuel said , stepping inside . She turned quickly , the spoon flying up in the batter bowl as she started . " Oh , Samuel . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder , as if she might see an army behind him . " Mam said I ought to make enough for everyone . " Samuel walked forward and took the bowl , setting it on the counter . He reached for her hands . " You do n't look so good . " She grimaced . " Thanks for the compliment . " He drew her closer . " Are you okay ? " Her eyes , when they met his , were the jewel blue of an ocean he had once seen on the cover of a travel magazine , and  --  he imagined  --  just as endlessly deep . They were what had first attracted him to Katie , across a crowded church service . They were what made him believe that , even years from now , he would do anything for this one woman . She ducked away from him and began to flip the pancakes . " You know me , " she said breathlessly . " I get nervous around these Englischers . " " Not so many . Only a handful of policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They may want to talk to you , though . They seem to want to talk to everyone . " She set the spatula down and turned slowly . " What did they find out there ? " " Your mother did n't tell you ? " Katie slowly shook her head , and Samuel hesitated , torn between her trust in him to tell her the truth and the desire to keep her blissfully unaware for as long as possible . He ran his hands through his straw-colored hair , making it stand on end . " Well , they found a baby . Dead . " He saw her eyes widen , those incredible eyes , and then she sank down onto one of the kitchen chairs . " Oh , " she whispered , stunned . In a moment he was at her side , holding her close and whispering that he would take her away from here , and to heck with the police . He felt her soften against him , and for a moment Samuel was triumphant  --  after so many days of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie stiffened and drew away . " I do n't think this is the time , " she chided . She stood and turned off the stove 's gas burners , then folded her arms across her middle . " Samuel , I think I would like you to take me somewhere . " " Anywhere , " he promised . " I want you to take me to see this baby . " " It 's blood , " the medical examiner confirmed , kneeling in the calving pen in front of a small , dark stain . " And placenta . Not a cow 's , from the size of it . Someone had a baby recently . " " Stillborn ? " He hesitated . " I ca n't say without doing the autopsy  --  but my hunch says no . " " So it just ... died ? " " I did n't say that , either . " Lizzie sat back on her heels . " You 're telling me someone intentionally killed this baby ? " The man shrugged . " I guess that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly in her mind . Given such a small window between the baby 's birth and death , chances were that the perpetrator of the crime was the infant 's mother . " What are we talking ? Strangulation ? " " Smothering , more likely . I should have a preliminary autopsy report by tomorrow . " Lizzie thanked him and wandered away from the scene the patrolmen were now securing . All of a sudden this was no longer an abandonment case , but a potential homicide . There was enough probable cause to get a warrant from a district judge for blood samples , evidence that might point a finger at the woman who had done this . She stopped walking as the barn door opened . A tall blond man  --  one of the farm help  --  stepped into the dim light with a young woman . He nodded at Lizzie . " This is Katie Fisher . " She was lovely , in that sturdy Germanic style that always made Lizzie think of fresh cream and springtime . She wore the traditional garb of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black apron that fell just below her knees . Her feet were bare and callused  --  it had always amazed Lizzie to see these Amish youth running down gravel roads without their shoes , but that was how they spent the summer . The girl was also so nervous that Lizzie could nearly smell her fear . " I 'm glad you 're here , Katie , " Lizzie said gently . " I 've been looking for you , so that I can ask you some questions . " At that , Katie moved closer to the blond giant beside her . " Katie was asleep last night , " he said . " She did n't even know what happened until I told her . " Lizzie tried to gauge the girl 's response , but something had distracted her . She was staring over Lizzie 's shoulder into the tack room , where the medical examiner was supervising the removal of the baby 's body . Suddenly the girl wrenched away from Samuel and ran out the barn door , with Lizzie chasing her to the farmhouse porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent one . Lizzie watched the girl trying to compose herself , and wondered what had prompted it . Had this been any ordinary teen , Lizzie would have taken such behavior as an indication of guilt  --  but Katie Fisher was Amish , which required her to filter her thoughts . If you were Amish , you could grow up in Lancaster County without television news broadcasts and R-rated movies , without rape and wife-beating and murder . You could see a dead baby and be honestly , horribly shocked by the sight . Then again , there had been cases in recent years ; teenage mothers who 'd hidden their pregnancies and after the birth had tied up the loose ends by getting rid of the newborn . Teenage mothers who were completely unaware of what they 'd done . Teenage mothers who came in all shapes , all sizes , all religions . Katie leaned against a pillar and sobbed into her hands . " I 'm sorry , " the girl said . " Seeing it  --  the body  --  it made me think of my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " She drowned when she was seven . " Lizzie looked toward the fields , a green sea that rippled with the breeze . In the distance , a horse whinnied , and another answered . " Do you know what happens when you have a baby ? " Lizzie asked quietly . Katie narrowed her eyes . " I live on a farm . " " I know . But animals are different from women . And if women do give birth , and do n't get medical attention afterward , they may be putting themselves in great danger . " Lizzie hesitated . " Katie , do you have anything you want to tell me ? " " I did n't have a baby , " Katie answered , looking directly at the detective . " I did n't . " But Lizzie was staring at the porch floor . There was a small maroon smudge on the painted white planks . And a slow trickle of blood , running down Katie 's bare leg .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
