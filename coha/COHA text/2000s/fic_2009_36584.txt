Mental Illness <p> <p> I lost and found the order of things the year the butteries did n't migrate down from the mountains . Low sky and hot , it was a parched summer , and the days dragged on like the smell of smoke after a fire . The weatherman on Channel 10 claimed that the absence of the butterflies had to do with the virus that killed the carpenter bees the year before ; that it had spread to the larvae of other insects or settled upon the milkweed that the winged creatures ingested . But I think it was just the heat . <p> I think the heavy wet air hung like a thick curtain , stretching from the foothills to the sand hills , a barricade of weather , and would not open for swallowtails or skippers , monarchs or sulphurs , or the faint whisper of hope that might have saved me from my decline . <p> To a casual observer , butteries appear wispy and undetermined , but really they are just as hardworking as the hummingbird or the dirt dauber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mosquito , but they are not idle . They understand that they have places to go . They stretch out those long curved bit of wings as if they enjoy showing off for the wind and the eye of the beholder , but they always realize their destination . They flap and hover , sometimes going more than seventy miles a day . <p> I 've seen streaks of magenta on a butterfly that would make my eyes burn , small smooth spots of black dancing upon yellow wings , and I have been dazed by the sleepy parachuting way they float . But I know better than to be fooled by a buttery ; she 's more than just a pretty face . She is engineered to be efficient and beautiful . <p> They burst forth from egg to caterpillar and eat as quickly and as much as they can digest , growing as large as is possible while shedding several layers of skin . Then they make themselves a hollow place to lie , a safe and protected chrysalis where they wait patiently for the spinning and changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death of what is hard and tight and miserable , they fight their way through webs of silk and dust , a tangle of what they used to be , emerging as something different , something extraordinary , to set sail to the sight of endless sun . <p> The North American butterflies start their descent to Mexico from roosts high in bat caves and along ridges of green hills thousands of miles away . Gliding toward the cool mountains , they are met with predators , pesticides , and fatigue . But millions of butterflies manage a migration and millions make it back . They are brawny and plucky and they will not light in a place or season that is unwelcoming . <p> I knew then , when the earth turned brown and the air stifled any plea sure from the coming together and breaking apart of clouds , when the warmth rose and swelled like tides in the sea , that heat was holding back my resolve and forcing the detour of the bright and brilliant insects upon which , for me , summer is marked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place I had fought to hide and felt no remorse or sadness at my loss , only a tinge of disappointment that I had missed the butterflies . <p> Once fallen , however , I decided in the days of reflection of that colorless season , that if it must be done , summer is a good arrangement of days in which to lose oneself . Not because the Earth with its revolutions and its increased daylight is as welcoming of it as it is in the opposite season , but rather because you 're rarely noticed and thereby given a reprieve from cheerful well-meaning friends who call you or drop by just to make sure you 've have n't bought a gun or hoarded medications . Most people assume you 're on some extended vacation or appear absentminded only because you 're inclined toward leisure . Everybody 's out of touch anyway , so days can pass and no one even misses you ; they just figure you 're hiking at the state park or that you took a day trip to the coast . <p> From Memorial Day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their anxious caregiving on hold , their temptations to worry stored away for winter , while supposing that distant friends and family members are enjoying the long sun and the invitation to go outside . They could n't possibly imagine that anybody they know could be strangled by darkness in such a fair time as this . <p> In the colder seasons it 's different because , unlike in summer , everybody suffers some depression in the winter . It 's just a common reaction to gray days and unfulfilled holidays . We 're sympathetic with the mentally ill during that frozen time because everybody understands how sadness might win out in the hours of darkness . <p> This sense of despondency was not my first experience of falling away from myself . It has happened to me before , and since it does not always fall upon my spirit in one particular period of time , I can not claim to have some seasonal disorder or light sensitivity . I guess one would say that I am simply prone to this kind of thing . Like Mama and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her cold sores , I just have a bent toward the shadows . <p> Usually , the sorrow is manageable . I move through it the way a person moves through a sprained joint or pulled muscle . I simply find another way to step or climb . It hurts , smarts really , but it 's something that can be done . I just try and put the sadness aside , shelve it like a book no longer useful . I know it 's there . It slows me down , but I just choose not to let it stop me . Most of the time that system works . A couple of times it has not . <p> I lost myself the first time when I was only four . I do not recall exactly what happened or how I coped . I only remember feeling very small , arms and legs pulled inside myself , a turtle in its shell , and being passed from one adult 's lap to another , from one set of arms to a broad chest , slung across a hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were an infant or a sack of wheat . <p> My mother says I stopped participating in life , arrested the progress , just after I learned to speak , something that already arrived very late in my development , and she always thought my fall into despondency was because I was afraid of the power of words . She told me once that when I was a child I had never seemed comfortable in conversation , that the nature of my play had always been quiet . She claimed that it concerned her at first , especially when I was silent for so long and then so completely after saying my first words , but that later she simply accepted that I would talk when it was necessary . She decided not to see it as a disability and not to pull me into meaningless speech just to assuage her fears . <p> I can not say if she was right about the cause of the early fit of sadness , but I do remember thinking that hearing the sound of my own voice was frightening in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words coming from my lips and recognized the power of being understood by others , it was as if I suddenly knew I was , because of the privilege of communication , somehow different from everything else in creation . The words I spoke , the ways I could name and organize my thoughts , suddenly set me apart from the trees and the river , insects and birds , the animals to which I had always felt connected . Once I heard them , felt the sounds being created from the combination of my tongue and brain , the power of such a thing saddened me . <p> I did not want to speak because somehow I believed it changed the very nature of who I was in the world . The thought of being separate simply weighted me down and bottled me up . I did not like , nor did I want to own , my voice . <p> I stayed that way , wrapped into myself , for months and I do not recall what finally loosened the words , stretched my limbs , or settled my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my mother , something about a neighbor , a man who died alone in a fishing boat far in the middle of the ocean . Since she had never stopped talking to me , just abstained from trying to pull me in the discussion , she brought the news of the man 's death the way she reported all of the day 's events to me . And somehow , I just recall being struck by how alone he was when he died . I asked a question  --  I do n't even know what it was  --  and heard an answer . My mother did n't seem to be alarmed or relieved at hearing my voice , just continued in the conversation . And afterward , I did not need to be carried any longer . <p> There was another time of silence and sadness tangled together in my life that I remember . I became disordered and lost when I was sixteen and had been recently pregnant . I miscarried at seven months in the autumn season and I simply fell away from myself again . Unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come quick and furious . My spirit was not suddenly lifeless like my distended womb . I did not suddenly feel frozen and still and small , broken by the disappointment of being separate . This loss felt more like a slow pulling of threads , like a tear in fabric , a loosening and widening along the sharp edges of my mind . Just like this time , this last time , at sixteen I hardly even noticed as it happened . <p> Once all the pieces had finally come undone and I was not able to carry on my usual responsibilities , I was taken out of school , kept at home . I did n't go to a doctor or a counselor . Mama did n't have the money or the insurance to cover such a thing . And I figure no one intervened , no one came to the house to try and pull me out or away from my loss , because they all just assumed it was because of the baby and its dying inside me , the sorrow of motherhood and adolescence knotting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it , so they just left me alone . <p> I misspent about a year that time ; try as I may , I can not recall one major event from any of those months as I lay in my bed coloring pictures in children 's coloring books . Not Christmas or birthdays , mine or my mother 's , or New Year 's Eve . I do not remember wide shoulders or fleshy arms or being held or wrapped . That event of brokenness is managed in my memory only by a series of manila pages with pictures of oversized bears and frogs , elephants and fairies , a collage of big smiling fantasies lumbering from drawing to drawing . <p> My mother , not knowing what else to do for me , not able to lift me and walk with me slung about her hip , bought new coloring books from the dime store every week . " Here you go , babe , " she 'd say , placing them near my head on the pillow , and I filled them up and threw them away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to mere stubs of deep clear color , until every page was filled in , every picture painted . <p> Attentive as a nurse , Mama would come into the room , lean across my bed , and wipe off the shards of crayons and the tiny pieces of paper that clung to my blanket and the heel of my hand . <p> " I found a book with fairies and angels , " she said one day , having spent her lunch hour in dime stores downtown , trying to find something , anything , that might lift me away from the sadness . <p> She bought box after box of crayons , book after book of nursery rhymes and storybook pictures , and she would hand them to me with a reassuring hand and a tense shaky smile . And this is the way it went month after month . It became a satisfactory life . <p> Then finally one day  --  a Thursday , I remember  --  I got out of the bed , went to my closet , and pulled out a yellow dress , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . No one was more surprised than I since I had made no plans to recover . But something about the angle of light from the morning sun , the little wax flakes of yellow and green spread all around me , and my mother 's steady chin , lifted me out of my despair and ushered me back into the world . <p> I was thirty-five-pounds lighter , fingertips stained with primary colors , and more than two semesters behind , but it did n't take long before I gained weight , returned to my natural pigmentation , caught up with the other students , and graduated on time . And as I returnect upon my teenage misfortune , I realize it unfolded and stretched away in a manner that is similar to my early childhood event , I still do n't know exactly how it happened or how I overcame it . <p> This last time , the summer time , the time the butterflies stayed away , I was not distracted by pregnancy or the loss of a baby . I was not fretful about being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not suddenly frightened by the sound of my voice or the strength of my words , I simply felt bits and pieces of myself fall aside , like the layers of clothes I shed with the coming of such a hot season . <p> The symptoms at age thirty-three were slow to show themselves . I , along with those who know me best , went weeks without realizing anything was wrong . At first , it was as simple as losing my sense of direction . I could n't remember which way I was going . I could n't place a location in my mind or get a clear picture of a park or building that everyone knew I had been to a million times . I would hear a name or be driving somewhere and suddenly feel as if I were in a town I had never been in , a life that was nothing like mine . <p> " You okay ? " the security guard asked me once as I stood at the edge of the parking lot trying to recall the color and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch me closely . <p> " Do you know who I am ? " I asked , not quite sure what I expected to hear . <p> " You work at the library , " he answered . " I do n't think I 've ever learned your name , " he added . <p> I nodded . " And my car , " I noted , " do you know my car ? " He scratched his head and considered the question . <p> " Blue Toyota , " he replied . " An old one , muffler is a bit too loud . " <p> And then , without hesitation or judgment , he nodded in the direction where I had parked just eight hours earlier . " Third row , about halfway down . " He paused . " It happens a lot , " he said , smiling . <p> But I knew it did n't happen a lot with me . And I began to notice soon that after forgetting directions and the make of my car , I forgot places and events , tiny pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quit caring about things , like knowing where I was , being worried that I was lost , or even the basics like if I brushed my hair or matched my earrings . I did n't care if I talked too loud or answered a person 's questions . I was n't concerned if I ate dinner or if I watered the African violets that lined the windowsill in my upstairs bathroom . It did n't matter if I kept my appointments or changed the litter in the cat box . And then eventually , I did n't even care if I ever left my bed . <p> May unfolded into June . The seniors graduated . The freshmen matriculated . The sophomores and juniors went on international study tours . The professors went on their exotic summer vacations . The cafeteria and fitness center slowed . The campus fell quiet and I just wanted to sleep . <p> Beginning around the middle of the month of June , a few people , coworkers at the library , my mother , a neighbor  --  Mrs. Bishop , who watched me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they suspected that something was not quite right with me . There were an increased number of phone calls from Mama and a few unexpected visits from my attentive neighbor . And yet , for weeks , even though I appeared disheveled and bore no signs of a physical ailment , I managed to convince them I had a virus or was tired from the heat , and for the beginning weeks of that long , hot summer , they mostly left me alone . <p> At work , however , when it soon got around that I was not taking vacation time or had discovered some new summer sport that kept me distracted , when it was common knowledge that I was n't sick with cancer or some other horrible disease , a few of the other staff started to wonder where I was and what I was doing . Having always been a very dedicated and hardworking reference librarian on the university campus , one about whom the others had never complained , it took a while , but not that long , before my colleagues were tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grievances , the director of library services at the school , my boss , Charles Hyde , Charlie , looked at me with a keen eye , watching me in the mornings when I got out of my car , at my desk when I answered the phones , when I walked into the stacks and returned the books that were left on the table . He did n't say anything for the longest time , but after Mary Simpson , the library manager , threatened to quit if he did n't do something about his reference librarian who was no longer doing her job , he waited until late in the afternoon on a Wednesday and called me to his office . <p> I had a bit of time to prepare myself because Jane told me that I had been reported . She walked over to my desk that morning after I had arrived a couple of hours late , fingers covering her mouth as she tried to hide her cold sore , and told me . <p> " Mary 's turned you in , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if anyone was watching . She dropped her hand away from her lips . " She said that you 're taking advantage of the library . " Jane paused , glancing around again . " She said you 're taking advantage of Mr. Hyde . What are you going to do ? " she asked . <p> I shrugged . " I guess I 'll do what ever I have to do , " I replied . <p> Jane nodded and slipped away , her face to the floor . <p> Charlie called me for a meeting later that afternoon . I walked in and he shut the door so nobody else would hear and pulled out the chair for me from behind the file cabinet . I slumped into it . As he headed around to his desk , I could feel his concern , the awkwardness he felt in having to reprimand me . I knew he did n't like doing what he was about to do . <p> Charlie did n't like conflict and he rarely interfered in the lives of his personnel . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to tell me everything about what is going on in your life . If you need a day off or need to be at home , just work it out with the other librarians and do what you need to do . As long as the job gets done , I 'm satisfied . " <p> And that was the way of things in the library . We never bothered him about dentist visits or sick children . We found people to fill in when we needed to be away . We managed our personal lives with one another , without drama or fanfare , and for the most part , there were very few problems . <p> It all changed , however , during that summer . The butterflies were missing and the heat was oppressive and I had tampered with the system . Folks were getting tired of it . Jane and Mary were tired of covering for me . Charlie was forced to become involved . For the director of library ser vices at the university , this was not a pleasurable thing . <p> He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown hair , a nervous habit I had only seen during bud get time and when he had to fire the janitor after finding him drunk and naked sitting in the history section of the library , reading the story of a village in France that was bombed during the war . The old man was weeping and singing verses of French songs , a bottle of red wine tucked under his arm . No one even knew the man who swept the floors and emptied our trash was Europe an and certainly no one expected him to show up to work during parents ' week disrobed and homesick for France . It was sad for everyone and a little frightening for the freshman U.S. history class whose members had been released from class to go to the library and research their midterm papers . Once the incident was reported to the president of the university , there was no alternative , Charlie had to let him go . <p> He sat up in his chair and then back . He nodded his head as if he were conversing with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for him to begin . <p> " A librarian must have use of all her faculties , " Charlie finally said , blowing out a long breath . And then he tapped his left and right forefingers on the edge of his desk as if he were playing the piano . He cleared his throat and glanced up at me with this kind of helpless expression , as if he needed some encouragement that he had done the right thing . <p> I searched his eyes and recognized the look of my mother 's worry . It is , after all , memorized deep in my psyche . Once I saw that , I knew what had to be done . And so without a response , without saying a word of agreement or discontent , I leaned over and picked up the receiver on the phone by his right elbow and dialed the infirmary . <p> Charlie pulled away from the desk and turned his chair to face the window while I made the appointment , a small but genuine show of respect . It was as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes away and it was so small and so kind an action I found myself touched by his tenderness . I received a date and time to see the doctor and I simply hung up the phone and walked out of his office without Charlie saying anything else . <p> I noticed Mary Simpson standing near the corridor that led to Charlie 's office . She smiled sympathetically and I returned the greeting . After all , I felt no ill will toward her for turning me in . With a daughter on drugs and a mother in the nursing home , she had problems of her own . She did n't need to be pulling my load in the library . She was right to report me and I knew it . <p> I returned to the reference section and started reshelving the encyclopedias . Charlie came out of his office , spoke briefly to his manager , probably explaining that the problem had been solved , and walked over to my section . He helped me put up the large atlas that somebody had taken from the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my end from me so that he could place it on the rack . And then Charlie turned to me and nodded as if I had done the right thing . After that , he walked over to the checkout counter and began loading books on the cart . Getting intervention was just that simple . <p> My appointment at the infirmary was the next day . With the academic school year ended and summer school between sessions , there were not that many patients needing to be seen . I went during my lunch period so that I would n't have to ask Mary or Jane to find someone to replace me at the reference desk . I knew I had reached my limit of grace with the library staff . <p> Once on my way , however , it took me much longer than I expected , about thirty minutes , to find the infirmary . Still struggling with the loss of my sense of direction , I could no longer find my way around the university campus . All the paths and signs and buildings seemed strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the clinic was behind the library next to the cafeteria and that the administration building was down a paved road to the right . But I was wrong . The infirmary was beside the personnel office , next to the fitness center , near the center of campus . I had walked past it four times without recognizing it . Because of my loss of orientation within the campus , I was more than a few minutes late . <p> First , I signed in , and then I waited until the nurse , Mary Joe Driver , who reads everything we have in the library about sexual dysfunction , came to the door and called my name . There was no one else in the waiting room and I was glad not to have to share the space with students who might recognize me from the library . <p> Nurse Driver took me to a corner in the hall where she weighed me and took my temperature , my pulse , and the other vitals . Having received my assistance in the library and knowing me professionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while she talked about the university and how everything had changed , the heat , and the incoming freshman class , I wondered whether indifference could alter the basic human functions that she was testing , if my blood pressure and my heart rate were slowed or quickened by the feelings of discontent , and I could n't help but wonder if she read the books she checked out for herself or was trying to figure out the problems of somebody else . <p> I simply answered her questions and participated in the conversation politely . I did not comment about the new president or the new vaccinations required of all students . Inodded and smiled and tried to read the numbers on the thermometer and the scales and the blood pressure monitor . And then she led me to the little examining room to wait for the doctor . <p> In the small room , there were posters about sexually transmitted diseases and tooth decay and an old wallpaper border that drooped in the corners . The room was painted mauve , a kind of dingy purple . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly open so that I could hear the outside noises of lawn mowers and people walking past . <p> I sat and waited for the doctor and thought about all the hundreds of young college students who had sat on this same table learning the news of infections and pregnancies , the complications of eating disorders and binge drinking . Ithought of all of the ways the students figured out how to keep the prognosis from their parents and all of the ways a young person grieves . I thought of all the diseases , all the bad news , all the tests and questions and blood samples and wondered how many people , if any , had come in complaining of feeling lost from themselves . <p> Dr. Simmons , the college physician , a muddle of a man himself , finally came into the room . I had seen him a few times before . Once when I had strep throat and a couple of times because of migraines . I do n't think he remembered me . <p> He asked me what was wrong as he looked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reading glasses and seemed to be studying my face . I told him I thought I was depressed or sad or something that was making me not care about anything . I told him I slept too much and that I was having difficulty remembering directions . He stood over me , nodding and smiling as if he had guessed such a thing , and listened to my heart , took my blood pressure again . He checked my reflexes , shined a tiny bright light into my eyes and asked how long I had been feeling like this . I said a few weeks . And then he sat down on his stool . <p> He glanced back over my medical history and wanted to know if I had been under a lot of stress in recent months , if anyone I loved had died , or if I had suffered a major breakup . To all of these I responded negatively while he chewed on the end of his pen , squinting his eyes at me , and continued making a humming noise while he jotted a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched him as he diagnosed me , as he put together all of the information and came up with a reasonable explanation for my sorrow . Finally , he spoke up , clear and confident of his findings . <p> " Since there is no direct cause for these feelings of discontent , " Dr. Simmons said , just after clearing his throat , " you must be experiencing some hormonal surge . " <p> I must have looked surprised . I know I felt surprised since of all of the reasons I had given myself for feeling this way , the monthly discharge I had been experiencing quite regularly for almost twenty years had not been considered . <p> He closed my chart and continued . " And this surge , just like your cycles , will one day pass . " He seemed quite self-assured , smiled at me , and since I have always been a person who honored the authority of physicians , I decided to believe him . <p> And then , feeling even more confident of his diagnosis , his ability to identify a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I think my smile boosted his confidence . He nodded at me or himself , I 'm not sure , and added that I was probably too easily affected by what goes on around me , that I needed a hobby or a friend and that maybe I should even think about a new profession since the library was known to hamper feelings of enthusiasm and spawn a certain amount of listlessness . <p> He gave me a few samples of sleeping pills , which seemed odd since that was the one activity in which I had not lost interest , patted me on the leg , and wrote a note of reference , sending me to a psychology professor who set up her practice in the storage room behind the campus police office . Nurse Mary Joe Driver called and made me an appointment and I went back to the library feeling no different than I had before I went . I even got lost again , ending up at the science building on the other side of the campus . I eventually made my way back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned . I had my first meeting with the psychologist the following week . <p> Dr. Lincoln was a perky young woman , a recent Ph.D . recipient , and I believe she truly thought she could help me . After taking a long history of my life , filling out three or four forms , she took me into her office and had me sit on a sofa . She studied exactly where on the couch I sat , how I crossed my legs , and seemed even to count the number of times I smiled . <p> After having me explain how I felt by using a number of assessment tools , including a scale from one to ten , with one being , " I want to kill myself , " and ten being " I 'm as happy as I 've ever been , " picking the closest to my feelings using a series of pictures of expressive faces , and having me read a book of cartoons while she measured my laughter , she decided that she could use me in her recently funded research project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could offer . <p> During our second visit , she tried to teach me how to hold off what she defined as " the negative emotion " by having me breathe my fears into a bag and surround myself in some bright color that could shield me from the poison that she said gets into my psyche . It took a few tries before I got the hang of exhaling in a bag . <p> For my color , originally I chose pink , but after having thoughts of being covered in Pepto Bismol , I settled on purple . I surrounded myself in a purple bubble and tried to let the color protect me . I wanted the purple to work . I closed my eyes and saw everything in purple . <p> We met five times and she spent an extra half hour with me during each of our sessions because she said I was an interesting subject , a classic model of study for her research . Dr. Lincoln also informed me during one of our times together that she did n't like her colleagues in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that she was confident that she would one day be famous . <p> For weeks , throughout the entire month of July , I did all of her exercises . I closed my eyes and breathed in the bag and then held it tight and far away . I visualized happiness as a light all around me , lit up like the sky at dusk . I soaked in purple , breathed in purple , even dreamed in purple . <p> I tried her other suggestions . I wrote down affirmations of my self-worth and taped them on my mirrors . I started keeping a journal . I exhaled in long , even puffs . I followed her finger as she sat in front of me and waved it from side to side , trying to hypnotize me . <p> I waited for Dr. Lincoln 's therapy to bring me back to myself , to pull the threads together , but somehow , the contents from my bag of pessimism leaked out the top or spilled through a weak corner or small crack and seeped back into my lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative emotion " and the purple could not save me . And even though I hated to be deemed unsuitable for her research and dropped as her perfect role model , when after more than six weeks she finally asked , I could not confirm that I was any better . <p> After immediately deciding I no longer met her needs , Dr. Lincoln sent me to a therapist , a man off-campus but who was employed by the university , who specialized in group work . After an initial assessment , I was assigned to a group of other professionals who were diagnosed with various and assorted mental illnesses . The doctor seemed to think he could offer instruction to " bridge gaps in socialization , " as he put it , where one-on-one talk therapy had failed . <p> In my appointed group , there was a post office employee with an anxiety disorder and a food ser vice worker struggling with obsessive-compulsive disorder , a campus policeman who was just diagnosed with cancer and who had developed a problem with anger management , and a retired professor whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and who could not stop crying . <p> We gathered on Tuesday nights and we sat in a circle and signed our names to promises of confidentiality that we would n't talk about what happened or who was there . I signed the paper and even though my mother was terribly curious about a man who cried continuously over being left by his wife and had tried a number of ways to learn his name , I never broke the promise . <p> After our fourth meeting , however , I was invited to leave the group when I initiated the discussion that since we were all so open with our pitiful stories of trouble and loss , Dr. Marshall , the psychiatrist in charge , the one who specialized in group dynamics and mental illness , should at least let us read the comments he wrote about each one of us after every session . <p> The postal worker and the grieving professor did n't even realize he was taking notes on them . They had never paid attention to the therapist during our sessions . I , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages in his little notebook filled and turned while we talked about the dark recesses of our minds . I watched him as he smiled and nodded with each entry , always eager to pull us back to a line of thinking he seemed particularly interested in . <p> Although I could see that the doctor was angry at me for voicing my observation , I did n't apologize for what I did . I 'm a librarian . I notice things . I 'm curious . I 'm just made that way . <p> Since I knew the therapist 's work , I asked him if he was gathering material for his third , bestselling How to Get Out of What You 've Gotten In psychology book . The question did n't set well with him or the other group members . The angry policeman stormed out and the chef with obsessive-compulsive disorder began counting spots on the ceiling . The doctor slammed his book closed and it was soon obvious that I was going to be asked to leave . <p> I was somewhat disappointed that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revelations of these deeply troubled people actually gave me some focus . I was fascinated in a way with the ease in which some folks tell things to strangers that they swear they have never before said to anyone . The intimacy in the group , the way the clients listened to one another , the cop and the mailman becoming friends , touched me in some deep and profound way . I started to like my fellow group members . I cared about them and wondered how they were doing when we were n't together . <p> I even found myself feeling a little lighter when I went home after a meeting because there was some brief but clear comfort in knowing that crazy people can appear so normal . We get up , go to our jobs , come home , watch the evening news . We are likely never to be noticed . We look like everybody else . There 's no mark on our foreheads or sticker on our cars . <p> It seems as if those of us fallen away from ourselves , broken or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad day , that we 're just like everyone else . We cook a great dinner . We laugh at jokes . We pass along the mail or arrest a thief or teach a class or help someone with research and nobody suspects a thing . And yet the truth I learned from that group is that we 're only a paint job , one or two light coats trying to cover each other , trying to hide what lies beneath . Everything can appear to be exactly fine until someone rubs it with a little pressure and suddenly the real color starts to bleed through . <p> After meeting those folks in my group , I shall never be surprised again at the people who confess to mental illness . We are the very ones that no one suspects , the very ones who seem to hold it all together and function perfectly in the world . <p> It was about two weeks after being dismissed from Dr. Marshall 's group and about three days after hearing the news that the college professor whose wife had left him committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the new school year was to begin , that it became obvious that the cheap paint splashed over my heart was peeling . I was finding no relief from my problems , no sense of getting closer to myself . What I had tried was not doing the job . <p> " Are you coming to work ? " Charlie called and asked on the Monday I decided to go to the hospital . <p> " I do n't think so , " I replied . I did n't know what time of day it was . I did n't know where I was supposed to be . <p> " Do you want me to send someone over ? " he asked . I considered his offer . <p> " I do n't think anything 's worked , " I said , although I was n't sure why I did . <p> " I know , " Charlie responded . " You 've got good coverage , " he added . <p> I felt confused . <p> " Insurance , " he explained . <p> " Right , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You want me to take you ? " Charlie asked . <p> " No , I 'll figure that out , " I responded , hung up the phone , and called the ambulance . <p> Talk therapy , one-on-one and in a group , sleeping pills , and a pretense that everything was just fine were not working . I knew I had to find help . The butterflies , gone and unaccounted for , the summer dragging on without reprieve , had taken its toll . <p> Excerpted from THE ORDER OF THINGS by Lynne Hinton <p> Copyright 2009 by Lynne Hinton <p> Published in March 2009 by St. Martin
