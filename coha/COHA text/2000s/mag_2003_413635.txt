" By following essential rules of proportion , they can create visual and emotional harmony . A kitchen designer can establish an ergonomic triangular work flow . An airport architect can harmonize ease of access with traffic volume ( we hope ) . If it 's done well , this type of efficient design is more visceral than is apparent to the eye . The design team at Chaparral has created one of the most harmonious express cruisers I 've ever boarded . If you want a boat that expertly blends performance , capability and comfort , the new 310 Signature should be on your " must sea-trial list " for 2004 . The more time I spent aboard , the more I sensed that every feature had been carefully designed for function and long-term durability . Nothing on the boat has been put there simply because it 's a stylish trend . If the feature is included , it works and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design concepts with other sport cruisers in its size range , including models from builders like Sea Ray , but the 310 seemed unique to me because almost everything was in precisely the right place , from stowage compartments to grabrails and drinkholders . I conducted the sea trial on a typical fall morning in South Florida  --  86 degrees and sunny with a slight easterly breeze off the ocean . Scott Leonardo , the general manager of Fort Apache Marine in North Miami , had arranged for me to get aboard the 310 . Joining me for the test was Capt . Brandon Kuhn , who eased the boat away from the dock into the Intracoastal Waterway and then motored south toward Haulover Inlet . The boat was fabulously quiet idling through the no-wake zones ; I measured just 64 decibels at the helm . The 270-hp Volvo Penta 5.0 engines were barely audible , even in what was a serene setting . Although a pair of 320-hp 5.7 engines also are available , the 5.0s were a good match for the 310 ; they delivered a top speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smooth . The Chaparral took tight turns at full throttle by simply dropping the lee rail and turning . There was no propeller cavitation , and the boat followed helm input precisely . The 310 pushed through seas smoothly , and did n't shudder or slam when it traversed boat wakes at speed . At the helm , there 's a bench-style seat with bolsters for both the captain and a companion . Chaparral uses darker shades of fiberglass at the dash to reduce glare , and the helm itself is comprised of multiple molded pod sections for the various instrument groupings . There are removable inserts , so instruments can be easily installed and serviced . Controls and switches are visible and easy to access . The only thing that seemed a bit out of place was the VHF radio , which was positioned below the wheel where it was inconvenient to operate and see . To port of the helm is a curved seat that is either a bench for two or a chaise lounge for one . The cockpit features a wet bar to port and settee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy yet surprisingly lightweight , which means it 's easier to stow . An Igloo cooler nests below the settee , where it 's both secure and easy to reach . Even the standard camper canvas package is simple to stow because it comes complete with a bag designed to help you keep things neat and organized . There are many other sensible ideas on the 310 . For example , the main battery panel is located at the transom just forward of the swim platform . This way it 's easy to manage the transfer from shore power to ship 's power while you 're connecting or removing the cabling . Plus , the battery transfer switches that manage the house batteries and starting batteries are not the typical one-two-both variety . They are set up so you ca n't inadvertently set them to " both , " thereby allowing the starting and house batteries to drain . On that same point , if the starting battery is low , there 's a switch at the helm that will provide extra juice from the house batteries to crank the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's located topside so that you can manage the operation in full view of the connection , averting a potentially messy situation . In the cabin , there 's plenty of light and air , thanks to three hatches and several side ports . The head compartment is to port , and it has an entry door that 's generously wide . Interestingly , the commode is located below a hinged bench seat that doubles as a convenient platform for towels , robes , etc . The space is much better utilized and more pleasing to the eye because of it . It 's a minor design element , but it 's an example of how Chaparral has thought through every inch of the boat . Forward is the galley and main salon , which has a settee that converts to a berth . At the forepeak is the " master cabin " with double berth . There 's also a mid-cabin aft that 's essentially a berth . On many boats of this type , the entrance to this area can feel claustrophobic , but on the Chaparral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the berth itself are bolstered so that it could make a good play area for children . I was only on the Chaparral for a short time , but it felt as if I had been aboard for years . Maybe that 's because everything was where I expected it to be . And everything was amply proportioned and substantial . If you want style in a solidly built boat , take a long hard look at the new 310 Signature .
