It was late October , and Moose County , 400 miles north of everywhere , was in danger of being wiped off the map . In the grip of a record-breaking drought , towns and farms and forests could be reduced to ashes overnightgiven a single spark and a high wind . Volunteer firefighters were on round-the-clock alert , and the congregations of fourteen churches prayed for snow . Not rain . Snow ! Winter always began with a three-day blizzard , called the Big One , that buried everything under snow drifting to ten feet . So the good folk of Moose County waxed their snow shovels , bought antifreeze and earmuffs , stockpiled bottled water and flashlight batteriesand prayed . Late one evening , in a condominium northeast of Pickax City , the county seat , a cat sat on a windowsill , stretching his neck , raising his nose , and sniffing . The man watching him thought , He smells a skunk . They had recently moved to the wooded area with its new sights , new sounds , new smells . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a calm , quiet nightuntil the whoop of a police siren shattered the silence , followed by the honk-honk of a fire truck speeding south on a distant highway . The noise stopped abruptly as the emergencyvehicles reached their destination . Reassured that another wildfire was under control , he went back indoors . The cat was lapping water from his bowl . It was remarkable that he had smelled smoke three miles away , on a night without a breeze , and with the window closed . But Kao K'o Kung , was a remarkable cat ! They had moved to a condominium in Indian Village for the winter : two Siamese and their personal valet , Jim Qwilleran . He also wrote a twice-weekly column for the local paper , the Moose County Something . Now middle-aged , he had been a prizewinning crime reporter for metropolitan newspapers Down Below , as the rest of the United States was known to Moose County . Odd circumstances had brought him to the north country with his two housemates , both adopted after crises in their nine lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sleek , stalwart male with amazing intelligence and intuition . Yum Yum was smaller , softer , and sweeter . Both had the pale fawn fur with seal brown " points " typical of the breed , and their brown masks were accented with shockingly blue eyes . While the female was adored for her dainty walk and kittenish ways , the male was admired for his masterful whiskerssixty instead of the usual forty-eight . By coincidence , Qwilleran was noted for his luxuriant pepper-and-salt moustache . It appeared at the head of his " Qwill Pen " column every Tuesday and Friday and was recognized everywhere he went , A well-built six-foot-two , he was seen walking around town , riding a bicycle , dining in restaurants , and covering his beat . But he had claims to fame other than the unorthodox spelling of his name and the magnificence of his moustache . Fate had made him the heir to the vast Klingenschoen fortune , and he was the richest man in the northeast central United States . Turning his wealth over to a foundation for philanthropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County . After the smoke-sniffing episode , Qwilleran gave the Siamese their bedtime treat and conducted them to their comfortable room on the balcony , turning on their TV without the sound , to lull them to sleep . Then he sprawled in a large chair and read news magazines until it was time for the midnight news on WPKX : " A brushfire on Chipmunk Road near the Big B minesite has been extinguished by volunteer firefighters from Kennebeck . When they arrived on the scene , the flames were creeping toward the shafthouse , one of ten in the county recently designated as historic places . ' Motorists driving on country roads are once more reminded not to toss cigarettes out the car window , ' said a spokesman for the sheriff 's department . ' Roadside weeds and forest underbrush are dry as tinder . ' This is the third such fire in a week . " Qwilleran tamped his moustache , as he often did when harboring suspicions ; strangely it seemed to be the source of his hunches . He thought , Arson for purposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any black-hearted arsonist who wanted to infuriate the populace could torch a shaft house . Yet , locals were reluctant to admit that " it can happen here . " Nevertheless , he had been glad to desert the centers of overpopulation , crime , traffic jams and pollutionand accept the quirks of small-town living . He himself was not inclined to gossip , but he was willing to listen to the neighborly exchange of information that flourished in coffee shops , on street corners and through the Pickax grapevine . At Toodle 's Market the next day , where he bought groceries , the three brush fires were the chief topic of conversation . Everyone had a theory . No one believed the sheriff . It was a cover-up . The authorities were trying to avert panic . The groceries were for Polly Duncan , director of the public library . Qwilleran had an arrangement with her . He shopped for her groceries while she slaved in the workplace . Then she invited him to dinner . It was more than a practical proposition ; Polly was the chief woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dinner-deal was especially convenient in the winter , when he closed his summer placea converted apple barnand moved his household to Indian Village . There he owned a condo , a few doors from Polly 's . He liked a periodic change of address ; it satisfied the wanderlust that had made him a successful journalist Down Below . Indian Village was an upscale residential development in Suffix Township ( which had been annexed by Pickax City after years of wrangling ) . It extended along the west bank of the Ittibittiwassee River . Rustic cedar-sided buildings were scattered among the trees : condominiums in cluters of four , multiplex apartments , a clubhouse , and a gatehouse . Qwilleran had Unit Four in the cluster called The Willows . Unit Three was occupied by the WPKX meteorologist , Wetherby Goode ( real name , Joe Bunker ) . There was a new neighbor in Unit Two ; Kirt Nightingale was a rare book dealer from Boston , returning to his hometown in middle age . ( " What do you suppose is his real name ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , was impressed by his erudition and said , " If we can accept Qwilleran with a QW and a weatherman named Wetherby Goode , we should n't flinch at a Nightingale . And he 's going to be a nice quiet neighbor . " That was important . The walls of the contiguous units were thin , and there were other construction details that were flawed . But it was a good address with a wonderful location and many amenities for residents . Arriving at Unit One with bags of groceries , Qwilleran let himself in with his own key ( Polly was at the library ) , greeted her two cats , and refrigerated perishable purchases . All the units had the same layout : a foyer , a two-story living room with wall of glass overlooking the river , two bedrooms on the balcony , and a kitchen and dining alcove beneath . A garage with space for one vehicle was under the house . There the similarity ended . Polly 's unit was furnishedeven overfurnishedwith antiques inherited from her in-laws . Qwilleran preferred the stark simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decorative accent . When friends asked , " Why do n't you and Polly get married ? " he would reply , " Our cats are incompatible . " The truth was that he would find it suffocating to live with the appurtenances of the nineteenth century . Polly felt the same way about " modern . " They stayed single . Before leaving , Qwilleran said a few friendly words to Brutus , muscular well-fed Siamese , and looked about for Catta , who was younger and smaller . A flicker of movement overhead revealed her perched on a drapery rod . She had the Siamese taste for heights . " Are you guys all set for the Big One ? " he asked . " It wo n't be long before snow flies ! " There was no answer , but he could read their minds . They sensed that he had cats of his own . They knew he had been there before , even feeding them when she was away . But was he to be trusted ? What was that large brush on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed against his ankles ; Catta squealed and hopped about . They knew he had a treat in his pocket . Polly 's harried voice came from the kitchen . " Qwill , I 'm running a little late . Would you be good enough to feed the cats ? Open a can of the Special Diet for him and the salmon in cream gravy for her .... And you might put a CD on the stereo . Not Mozart . " " What 's for dinner ? " " Minestrone and lasagne . " " How about mandolin music ? " Polly had put a butterfly table and two ladderback chairs in one of the large windows , setting it with Regency silver and Wedgwood . After adding a plentiful garnish of Parmesan to the soup , Qwilleran asked , " What 's the latest news in the stacks ? " He knew that the library was the unofficial hub of the Pickax grapevine . " Everyone 's concerned about the brush fires , " she said . " The Big B mine was owned by Maggie Sprenkle 's great-grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shafthouse , she 'd have a heart attack ! " Qwilleran smoothed his moustache . " Has there ever been a threat to a shafthouse in the past ? " " Not that I know , and I 've lived here since college . " " It 's ironic that last night 's incident should coincide with the dedication of the plaques . " Ten bronze plaques , donated anonymously , had been installed at the historic minesites . " That 's exactly what Maggie said . She was the donor , you know , although she does n't want it known . You wo n't mention it , will you ? " " Of course not . " He had already heard the rumor from three other sources . When the lasagne was served , conversation turned to the art center 's new managerBarb Ogilvie , the art-knitter . " A very good choice , " Polly said . " She 's well-organized and has a pleasant personality . She 's going to teach a class , and she 'll be able to do her own knitting on the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . At the craft fair I bought several pairs of her goofy socks for Christmas gifts . " " Not for me , I hope , " Qwilleran said . " By the way , my compliments on the lasagne . It 's one of the best I 've ever tasted . " " Thank you . It 's from the deli , " she said smugly , countering his brash remark about the socks . " Beverly Forfar was never right for the manager 's job , although I liked her as a person . I wonder where she is now . " " She found work in a large university town , I happen to know , " Qwilleran said . " She wo n't have to worry about chickens crossing the road , or tractors dumping mud on the pavement . " " She had a strange haircut , did n't she ? " " Yes , but good legs . " " Help yourself to the sauce , Qwill . Mildred made it . The recipe came from the chef at the Mackintosh Inn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antique Scottish curling stonedid you know ? It 's in a glass case in the lobby , " he said . " Is Nightingale still staying at the inn ? " " No , the moving van finally arrived from Boston , with his furniture and books . How could it have taken them so long ? " " They got lost , " Qwilleran guessed . " They could n't find Pickax on the map . They had a triple load and delivered here by way of Miami and St. Louis . " They had met Kirt Nightingale at a welcoming party in the Village and were impressed by his expertise , although they found him ordinary in appearance and without much personality . He intended to publish his own catalogue and do mail-order business from his condo . Qwilleran , a collector of old books , had asked a question about Dickens , and the dealer said , " If you 're interested , I can get you three volumes of Sketches by Boz for thirty thousand . Two were printed in 1836 and the third a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three or five dollars for a preowned classic at the used book store in Pickax . When he and Polly recalled the incident over dinner at the butterfly table , she said , " Do n't you think it gives us a certain clat to have a rare book dealer in our midst ? " " How much clat do you want ? " he asked . " We already have you and me and the WPKX meteorologist and the publisher of the newspaper and a city councilmemberand the Indian Village developer himself ! " The last name was added with sarcasm ; Don Exbridge was not highly admired by the residents . They blamed him for the thin walls , leaking roofs , rattling windows , and bouncing floors . But it was , they told themselves , a good address . After the dessertfresh pears and gorgonzolaQwilleran built a fire in the fireplace , and they had their beverages in front of the comforting blaze : tea for her , coffee for him . He knew her so well but not well enough to ask , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it been in the house ? How do you store it ? What brewing method do you use ? " She asked , " How 's the coffee , dear ? " She knew he was a connoisseur . " Not bad , " he replied , meaning it was drinkable . " I 'm glad you like it . It 's only instant decaf . " Later , when he was leaving , he noticed a carved wooden box on the foyer table . It was long compared to its other dimensions , and the hinged lid was carved with vines and leaves surrounding the words LOVE BOX . " Where did you get the box ? " asked . " Oh , that ! " she said with a shrug . " On the day the moving van came , I thought it would be neighborly to invite Kirt in for a simple supper , and the box was a thank-you , I suppose . " She had shortened the man 's splendiferous name to a single syllable . " What is its purpose ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter is half-hidden by the leaves . It had belonged to his mother , and he wanted me to have it . It seemed like a rather touching gesture . " " Hmff , " he muttered . " Actually I do n't care for the light oak and stylized carving . It seems rather mannish , and I have a lovely needlepoint glove box that my sister made .... I wish you 'd take it , Qwill . " " How old is it ? " " Early twentieth century , I 'd guess ... But whatever you do , do n't let Kirt know I gave it away ! We 'll put it in a large plastic bag , in case he 's looking out the window when you carry it home . " The glove box looked good on the sleek modern chest of drawers in Qwilleran 's foyerold enough to be interesting but not old enough to look fussy . He immediately filled it with his winter gloves : wool knit , leather , fur-lined . It stood alongside a handmade lamp from the craft exhibita tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and came to investigate . Koko 's nose traced the letters on the lid from right to left . " He reads backwards , " Qwilleran always said . Thenabruptlythe cat 's attention was distracted . He jumped down from the chest and went to a southeast window , where he stretched his neck , raised his head , and sniffed , while his tail switched nervously . Without waiting to hear the scream of the police sirens and urgent bleat of the fire truck , Qwilleran ran out to his van just as his neighbor , the weatherman , was returning from his late-evening report . Qwilleran rolled down the car window . " Joe ! Quick ! Get in ! " Wetherby Goode was a husky , happy-go-lucky fellow , always ready for an adventureno questions asked . Settled in the passenger seat , he asked casually , " Where to ? " " I think there 's another fireto the southeast . Open the window and see if you smell smoke . " " Not a whiff ... but southeast would be across the river . Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That took them to the intersection of Sprenkle and Quarry roads . They stopped and looked in three directions and sniffed hard . There was no traffic on these back roads at this hour . " Go east another mile to Old Glory Road , " Wetherby said . " There 's a mine down there , " Qwilleran said . " Has it occurred to anyone that these fires are at minesites ? " " Well , the theory is that these abandoned mines are bordered by secluded dirt roads that kids use as lovers ' lanes . The chances are that they smoke and throw cigarettes out the window .... You do n't hear of any fires starting in daylight . " Approaching the Old Glory Mine , they could see the taillights of a car receding in the distance . " See what I mean ? I see a red glow just ahead ! " Qwilleran stopped the van and used his cell phone to report a brush fire at Old Glory mine . They waited until they heard the emergency vehicles on the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cat who smelled smoke , " Qwilleran said . " Koko sees the invisible , hears the inaudible , and smells the unsmellable . " " Jet Stream never smells anything unless it 's food , " Wetherby said . Have you met the new guy in Unit Two ? " " I introduced myself out on the sidewalk one day , and we had a few words . I asked what had happened to the Jaguar he drove when he came here . He said it was too conspicuous among all the vans and pickups , so he disposed of it in Lockmaster and bought a station wagon , four-wheel-drive . " " Has he discovered our dirty little secret ? " Qwilleran asked . " If the roof leaks on his thirty-thousand-dollar books , XYZ Enterprises will get sued for plenty . " " The roofs have been fixed ! " Wetherby said . " Just in time for the worst drought in twenty yearswould n't you know ? But you were at the beach this summer when they reroofed the whole Village ! " " How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You missed the fun , Qwill . A few of us got together and vandalized the XYZ billboard at the city limitsthe one that says , ' We stand behind our product . ' A prime example of corporate hogwash ! Well , we went out after dark and pasted a twelve-foot patch over it , saying . ' We stand under our roofs with a bucket . ' We tipped off the newspaper , of course . The sheriff 's night patrol stopped , and the deputy had a good laugh . It did n't hurt that one of the vandals was a city council member . The roofers were on the job the next day ! " Qwilleran said , " That story 's good enough for a drink , Joe . Do you have time ? " " Next time , Qwill . I have to get up early tomorrow and drive to Horseradish for a family picniclast get-together before snow flies . I hear you 're driving a limousine in the Shafthouse Motorcade . " " Yes , and I may live to regret it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
