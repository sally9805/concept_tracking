Oo Chapter One : Hard-Boiled Hardys My skin was burning ! Every breath was like sucking fire straight into my lungs . I pounded on the door , but it was locked from the outside . Now , I love a good sauna  --  most of the time . But 180 degrees ? Give me a break ! " Any great ideas ? " I asked my brother Frank  --  not because he 's a year older than I am , but because he has a long history of thinking us out of trouble . We 'd been on the trail of a notorious people trafficker  --  a really bad , really rich guy . This sleazebag happened to belong to the very exclusive Moscow Health and Fitness Center  --  that 's Moscow , as in Russia . Working with ATAC ( American Teens Against Crime ) in partnership with Interpol , Frank and I had followed Mr. Bigski all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and right into this sauna that was about to broil us alive . Since this particular bad guy had made a specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be teenagers  --  Frank and me , disguised as bait  --  who would track this bad boy down . Well , we 'd tracked him down , all right  --  straight into this sauna . The only problem was , he 'd been onto us  --  maybe from the very start  --  and now Frank and I were the ones who were cornered ! When our mark got up and left the sauna , we waited a minute or two , like any goodinvestigator who 's tailing a suspect . Only then did we try to follow him . That 's when the door refused to budge , and we realized he 'd locked us in ! A quick check of the thermostat showed he 'd jimmied that , too  --  the control lever was gone . While 180 degrees Fahrenheit is n't technically boiling , it was plenty close enough to finish us off . I wondered where the pool boy had gone off to . Mr. Bigski must 've paid him a handsome tip to get lost , I figured . " Okay , big brother , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redwood bench as the waves of heat rose all around us . " Now what do we do ? " " First , I would like to point out , " Frank stated , " that it was your idea to trail this guy to the health club . Not mine . " " This is no time to argue , " I said . He was right , though . It was my idea . " Come on , Frank , you know you 're the brains of this outfit . " " Flattery will get you nowhere , " he said . " Even if it 's true . " " I ca n't even think in this heat . " " Well , if you 'll just stop talking for a minute , I 'll take a stab at it . " He sighed and lowered his head into his hands . The heat kept radiating from the lava rocks , hitting me in little waves ... thwap ... thwap ... thwap ... If it got any hotter in here , I was definitely going to pass out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank . " Right on cue , he cried , " I have an idea ! Got any metal on you ? " " Metal ? Frank , we 're in our bathing suits ! " " Your chain , man . " " This ? This is gold , dude  --  twenty-four carats ! " " Joe , we have n't got time to fool around here . " It hurt me , but I took off the chain and handed it to him . Then I leaned back on the bench and closed my eyes . I was on the edge of fading out , and I had to keep biting my lip just to stay awake . Frank grabbed a towel someone had left behind on the bench and wrapped it around his hand to protect it . Then he reached into the pile of steaming lava rocks , jamming the chain deep into the sauna 's power source . There was a sudden spark , and a loud POP ! In an instant , all the lights went out , and we were in total darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you okay ? " I sure hoped he had n't electrocuted himself trying to save us ! " I ... I think so , " he said in a shaky voice . " I did get shocked pretty good .... " " That was a stupid , stupid thing to do , Frank . " " I did n't see much choice , Joe . Either the heat got short-circuited , or we did . It ought to start cooling off in here pretty soon . " " Aw , our brains 'll be boiled by then ! And meanwhile , we 're still locked in . " " You think so ? Try the door . " " What ? " " Just try it . " I did  --  and guess what ? It opened . Man , that Frank is smart ! How did he know that the lock on the sauna door was hooked up to an electronic release ? " I 've got ta hand it to you , Frank , " I told him . " In this heat , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone an idea like that . " " Ah , it 's nothing . " " Sure you 're all right ? " " Nope . Now could we please get moving ? " A faint glow from the club 's emergency lighting system filtered in . It pierced the steam that rose from the whirlpool and filled the entire pool enclosure . In the dim light , I turned and saw Frank  --  and jumped backward in shock ! His hair was sticking straight up . The ends looked a little charred , and so did his eyebrows  --  but otherwise , he was definitely alive . His eyes were opened wider than I 'd ever seen them . The dry towel that had protected him was charred and smoking as he unwound it from his hand and dropped it on the floor . " Come on , " he said , brushing past me . " Let 's get out of here  --  we 've got to catch that guy before he gets away ! " " You think he 's still hanging around ? " I asked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I were him , I 'd be long gone . " But I was wrong . Again . Because suddenly the door to one of the shower stalls banged open behind me . Instinctively , I ducked  --  and a good thing , too . The gunshot missed my head by inches , ricocheting off the wall and sending pieces of tile flying everywhere . I went into a roll and buckled the guy 's knees . He let out a yelp and went down in a heap , just in time for Frank to yank away his gun while I pummeled him into total submission . " That was n't a very nice thing to do , mister , " I told him . " But then , you 're not a very nice guy , are you ? " He did n't answer . In fact , I 'm not sure he heard me . He looked pretty out of it , thanks to my poor sore fists . " I 'll alert the police , " said Frank , stepping outside and pulling out his cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm fine now , " I answered . Getting off the passed-out crook , I stepped into a shower stall and turned on the cold water . I needed to cool off now , before I passed out myself . " Sure you 're okay , Frank ? " I asked . " You look kind of ... electric . " He ran a hand through his hair , which kept standing straight up anyway . " I 'm fine , " he insisted . " Never felt better in my life . I 'm all ... tingly ! " His whole body shuddered , and I could swear I saw sparks flying . But charged up or not , he was definitely alive , and that was a big relief . " Ahhh , " I said , letting the cold water of the shower pour all over me , while I kept a wary eye on the motionless Mr. Bigski . " You know , you 're right , Frank . I do feel pretty good . And I 've never felt cleaner , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
