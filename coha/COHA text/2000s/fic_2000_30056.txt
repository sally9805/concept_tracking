I can not even think of Manila during the war without drawing in my mind a picture of General Douglas MacArthur . And I can not do justice to the memory of either him or the war without first visiting Manila Bay . It was my first order of business on Sunday . I had arrived the evening before , heading from the airport to a new hotel in the business district of Makati , six miles from old Manila . The travel agent who booked my trip had urged me to stay in Makati , praising its newfound opulence at the hands of Chinese and Japanese investors . She did not steer me wrong . Even though I had been in Manila only a few years before , the bright lights of Makati amazed me . A sparkling circular pool marked the horseshoe entrance to the Esmeralda Hotel , at the center of which was a brightly lit fountain that spewed its geysers twenty feet into the air . I was greeted by smiling , white-coated attendants and in the marbled lobby was passed along to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card processors . They were all very pleasant , and indeed well trained . It was as if I had reached an oasis imported from Las Vegas or possibly Hong Kong . Dinner was exquisite . The Esmeralda was a lovely hotel , but to me it was not very Filipino . The next morning I hired a car , and even on a Sunday we crawled for more than an hour through a vast mass of congestion and construction just to reach downtown Manila . Stuck in the traffic , my heart played little tricks on me . In February 1945 our military forces had come into Manila along the forerunner of this same road . In front of us , the steadily retreating Japanese had burned and raped and murdered in a final orgy of certain defeat , leaving a hundred thousand corpses strewn like foul garbage among pyres that had once been homes . The sight had filled me with hatred . But Manila , fecund and resilient like its people , had recovered , and Japanese businesses had led the way . The metropolitan suburbs had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now choked the streets and byways of the city . Finally I reached downtown Manila and then the American embassy , its high walls and wide lawn and square white buildings connecting me at once to that other era . Not so long ago the embassy had been its very own oasis , an isolated splendor now lost to the glassy modernity of Hiltons and Nikkos and Esmeraldas . After a little negotiation I managed permission to walk along its flat , sprawling side yard to where a low wall overlooked Manila Bay . I strode quickly in the lush grass , at first near the buildings and then across the helicopter pad , and finally in the rear where it approached the vistas of the mammoth bay . My chin was raised like a bird dog 's and my heart was racing with excitement , so anxious was I to be near the bay . My strong gait seemed to surprise the young foreign service officer who had been assigned to accompany me . But I was once a fine athlete and have always been sturdy , even in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him anyway , uninterested in contemporary travelogue , caught up in a moment long ago . He persisted , seeking to make conversation . " Are we in a race , Ambassador Marsh ? The bay 's not going to disappear , you know . " He was certainly no Asia hand . I pointed to the sky above the bay . " How long have you been out here ? Can you not yet read East Asian weather ? " Indeed , the rain was coming . The air clung to me like a gentle blanket as we walked . The sun fell slowly away behind a thick , viscous bank of pillowy grey clouds , leaving them pink around the edges . The wind started blowing in hot and horizontal from the bay , like the breath of some unseen dragon . I knew from other days that I had better hurry , because soon the sky would become a torrent and the streets would flow like rivers and the bay would disappear from view as completely as if it had become full night . I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who was not yet born the first time I had caught this gaze , she had greeted me in her office despite the holiday , and then insisted that I have full run of the embassy grounds . I am retired now , hardly worthy of such attention , but an unspoken , common bond exists among most ambassadors , present and former , that allows these little courtesies . Since I had represented our country in three different Asian nations over the course of my career , she had graciously overlooked the suddenness of my unannounced arrival and insisted that I tour her grounds , even assigning me this young , irritatingly eager seeing-eye escort . Walking with him toward the wall I decided that his probable assignment was to scoop up my corpse and ring some magic bell should I collapse from the heat . But it was he who flinched and squirmed under the steaming sky , not I. By the time we reached the wall he was sweat-drenched , working to hide his irritation at having been called away from his air conditioner . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful , then started pointing out hotels and skyscrapers and ships out in the bay , all the proud and promising changes along Manila 's new horizons . And finally I could take it no more . Young man , " I said , folding my arms and turning my face out to the sea , " if you do n't mind , I would like to be left quiet and alone . " Somewhere behind me he disappeared , fading like a polyester ghost toward the embassy , no doubt glad to be relieved of this dubious mission . My eyes did not follow him , nor did I say good-bye . Instead I stood transfixed , consumed not merely by what was before me but by all that I had seen and lost since I first had held this vision . I was looking out into the bay , but I was swallowed like Jonah into the belly of a different time , another world , indeed another person who used to bear my name . Far against the horizon I could see a faint nipple on the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its right in my vision , now fading through the mist of the distantly approaching rain , was the Bataan Peninsula . The two landmarks are still sacred to me , an old soldier 's wailing wall . In the cruel months following Japan 's invasion of the Philippines , the overwhelmed American and Filipino soldiers fought a rear-guard action down the peninsula , ending up in a last-ditch defense on Corregidor itself , all the while hoping that reinforcements and resupply might somehow arrive and free them from their devastation . Reinforcements did arrive , but more than two years too late . They had been forced to surrender , then march back up the peninsula under the probing bayonets of the conquering Japanese , and then after that had still waited , starving and tormented in disease-ridden prisoner camps . If the reinforcements were late , it is fair to say that they arrived when they did only because General Douglas MacArthur had made a promise to these defenders , his own soldiers , when he escaped from Corregidor on a PT boat , and he did not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allies ' southern advance . Once the Philippines were reinvaded MacArthur made a point of liberating the archipelago in its entirety , single-handedly winning a debate against more senior officers who were calling for him to take only a chunk of the distant island of Mindanao for bases and then proceed northward to Formosa . I did not fight in Bataan or Corregidor , never underwent their terrors , but I was with him after the liberation of Manila as we traveled to the filthy , stench-saturated prisons at Muntinglupa and Santo Tomas , where he greeted the survivors among the soldiers he had left behind . They seemed half human as they stood in their hollow-eyed , pointy-boned , gaunt thousands , staring at their old commander as if he had returned from the dead to anoint them for their suffering . He was at his best on those visits , filled with emotion and bold prose , and when MacArthur was at his best he was better than anyone then alive . They lined up in a pitiful formation for him at Santo Tomas and as he toured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a part of his obsession . Nearer to me as I stood looking at the bay , perhaps only a mile up to my right , was the elegant old Manila Hotel , which for many years before the war had been MacArthur 's home . Another memory leaped out at me as I peered up the coastline , watching it  --  the General running up the hotel steps toward his old penthouse as the battle to recapture Manila still raged around us , joining a machine gun team that was retaking the hotel . His eyes were on fire with fear . It was not fear of death that shone on his face ; I was with him constantly during those long months and I never saw him flinch from the thump and crackle of enemy guns . It was the kind of nauseating dread that one feels when the symbols of his very life are being destroyed . The Japanese , who had taken over his penthouse and used it as a command post , had set it afire as they retreated . Smoke billowed down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning . Bodies of shot enemy soldiers tumbled and fell down the landings . MacArthur had raced forward , impervious . In the living room of his former home the General stepped over a just-dead Japanese colonel who was oozing blood onto the charred carpet and surveyed the rubble and ashes that once had been his defining treasures . He had labored for three years to save them and had arrived only a few minutes too late . Pointing to the smoldering library , where not one book had survived , he managed a wry and yet prophetic observation . " All the treasures that define us have been destroyed , Jay . Do you understand what I mean ? It will never be the same after this war is over . " I did not understand him then , but I do now . For it was also MacArthur who insisted that the history of the world for the next thousand years would be written in Asia . Looking at the burned books , he had seen beyond all our lives . I turned yet again , my eyes searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nearby were Sampaloc and Quiapo and after that Quezon City . And for the first time I felt the weight of my years and the utter loneliness of a dream that but for my own foolishness would certainly have happened . Yes , I was a young man here . And yes , I was in love . And I did not handle it well . It is an old story , unless you 've never lived it . And so I had a mission to fulfill on this trip , one that I had struggled with for more than fifty years . Now that my bones were rattling and my life was mostly lived , I was finally going to see her again . I held no great hopes for this visit , other than perhaps to catch a glimpse of what had been my better self . Thinking of her I found myself again becoming angry , and I knew the anger was directed within . It was a recent phenomenon for me , this bitter disappointment with the man I had become . Make no mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there were prices to pay , and I began paying them at Quezon City . And I paid further at Los Banos . I turned to look southward , where perhaps thirty miles away at a camp near that town , in the middle of the night five months after the war was done , I had been forced to witness the hanging of General Tomoyuki Yamashita . It had been my price for questioning MacArthur 's almighty judgment and his motives . I had seethed mightily as the trapdoor sprung , but it was indeed a brilliant way of reinforcing his infallibility , that I should be ordered to watch and report on all the minutiae of the very action that I had dared to question , and then be rewarded for my acquiescence and continued silence . Fifty-one years ago , to this very day . Yes , I learned the importance of symbols and anniversaries from General Douglas MacArthur . And of arrogance and intimidation , both useful tools . Facing Los Banos , I noticed that my polyestered , seeing-eye foreign service officer escort had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white embassy building . The young fool caught my gaze and jogged out to me as if summoned . There was a new respect or at least a curiosity in his limpid , moonful face as he reached me . " I was just talking with the ambassador , " he said breathlessly . " She tells me that you actually knew Douglas MacArthur . " " I worked for him , " I answered , turning away and looking at the approaching rain . " What was he like ? " " I just felt a drop of rain , " I said , avoiding his question , for it is one that I have seldom seen fit to answer . My silence proceeds from a small but insistent conceit . Many people have claimed that they knew Douglas MacArthur . I knew him better than any of them and so I must say that all of them were wrong . Because I knew him not at all . The General , as he demanded to be called , had no friends . Born like a crown prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his first breath a creature of the army 's rigid structure . People came in categories . There were superiors , who must be wheedled , impressed , and at the proper moment defied . Next came peers , to be intimidated , secretly probed , and then defeated in pursuit of rank and honors . Below them were subordinates , who owed the Great Man flawless performance , from unquestioning loyalty , and frequent adulation . Then out beyond the khaki-sentried gates , on the other side of the bugles and the camp fires , lived the grey , foreign " other world , " a place never , even in his dotage , to be actually lived in but always to be tolerated . For who but they could paint his glory upon the canvas of the nation 's history ? These Other Worlders were in his mind a mixed and unhappy bunch , all in need either of his blanket or his sword  --  unknowing and ten , undisciplined civilians , scheming , malleable politicians , oppressed peoples with their rice bowls and empty hands stretched hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most honorable of them marching toward him through fields of muck with their weapons at the ready , the truly contemptible among them armed only with cameras that needed to be tricked or notepads to be lied into . And finally , always in his waking thoughts like the summer sun 's warmest aurora , was his mother , Pinky . Pinky was the only person who had ever truly known MacArthur . Indeed she was the very force that created him , not merely in the flesh but in the always unsettled , reaching maw of his yearning and domineering spirit . She had lost her two other sons , one to disease and the other to war , and through most of the General 's life seemed to compensate by compelling him to be large enough for all three of their youthful dreams . And certainly he was more than one mere man , although perhaps not in the manner that Pinky had imagined . He was a brilliant and tormented child , Douglas MacArthur , even at age sixty-two , when I first met him . Even yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years later , a few weeks before he died . I rode with him , flew with him , sat through his peacock tirades , lived for his praise , and suffered his abuse as if I were some eager young Polonius . Each day was a roller-coaster ride . I ran the gamut of emotions  --  ever happy to be near his greatness , fortunate to be treated to the wonders of his mind , distressed from time to time at my inability to comprehend the centuries that passed before his eyes even as he studied the mindless mire of a rain-driven rice field , thrilled on the rare occasions he would pat me on the back and tell me how important were my small , throbbing contributions to the advancement of the war and thus the universe . Yes , a young Polonius . Not at the hot gates , where the war belched its ugly , temperamental fury , but in the jeep , on the plane , five people down from the Great One , reading his mail , taking his orders , running his secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered advice . Deferential , as they say . Devoted , to a fault . Glad to be of use . We did have a few things in common . We both were born in Arkansas  --  he by the mischance of army assignments , in Fort Dodge , near Little Rock , where his father served frontier duty as an infantry officer , mine by the sad inevitability of four generations of misguided meanderings , in a tenant house fifty miles to the north , where my own father sharecropped someone else 's cotton along chopped and sunbaked rows of powdered earth scratched from the snake-filled forest . We both were seduced early in our lives by East Asia , gone green and willing like stupefied young lovers to its clamoring energy , its swelter and odd rhythms , and then never shaking its seduction , forever after finding euphemistic reasons to return . We both made careless choices in our women , coming painful and naive to romance and paying a lifelong price for our hesitations . And of course there was the army , that frail gossamer which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzling but terrifying years . And there was also much to divide us . But that came later . Out in the bay the rain approached swiftly , making a wide cat 's paw on the water that crept ever closer . A few drops splashed against my face . I knew I must hurry or be drenched . I began logging toward the embassy building , my escort in tow . As we reached the building a ragged curtain of rain roared across the yard behind us , pulling a full storm behind it as it moved with fury into old Manila beyond the embassy walls . I found myself laughing as the storm passed within arm 's reach of my haven under the building 's eaves . Its timing was perfect , the ideal final welcoming moment of my return . " I 'll leave now , " I said . " Thank the ambassador for her courtesies , will you ? " He had a new mission , though , as if he deserved some payment in kind for having interrupted his Sunday siesta to accompany me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched his expectant face , knowing he would not understand , and sighed out a small reward . " He was brilliant when he spoke of war and history , but he could be stupid with people who manipulated his ego . He was kind , but in the end I found him cruel . He helped me more than any other person . But in truth , he did it for himself . " The young man looked at me as if I had uttered the Riddle of the Sphinx . I ignored his further curiosity , heading into the building and cutting along the corridors until we reached the front portico , where my car still waited . I reconsidered as we walked , and at the car I surprised him . I shook his hand and then held it firmly , watching his eyes grow ever rounder as I spoke . " He killed a man . I could say murdered , but what would be the use ? He killed a great man because of his jealousy and his ego . " " Who ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " MacArthur . " " No , sir . I mean , who did he kill ? " " Why , General Tomoyuki Yamashita , " I answered . " He killed him , with the full blessing and encouragement of the Japanese imperial government . They wanted one thing , he wanted another . And Yamashita became the sacrificial lamb that served them both . I watched it . I was a part of it . " He was looking at me as if I were a different person , not an eminent retired ambassador who had made a fortune on Wall Street but an old man who had brought a bad rain , given over to a vengeful paranoia . " But I 've read about this , sir . A military court convicted Yamashita . And the Japanese would n't have wanted him dead  --  he was one of their greatest war heroes . And anyway , the imperial government was dissolved by the time MacArthur took over the occupation . " " A court ? It was not a court . And the imperial government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know nothing , " I finally let go of his hand . " And Yamashita ? The imperial court hated him ! They had other people to protect , you know . " He chuckled to himself , turning his head for a moment to hide a smile , and I knew that in his eyes I now had become an old fool . Diplomatically changing the subject , he pointed to the deep scar that to this day lags across my right cheek like an ugly bolt of lightning . " I hope you do n't think I 'm rude , sir . But did you get that in the war ? " Now , that was indeed rudeness . I opened up the car door . " I got it here in the Philippines . " I climbed into the car . " Good day , young man . I really do have to go ! " I left him puzzled and speechless in the driveway , waving slightly as we pulled out into the still ravenous rainstorm . As usual I had said as little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it mattered . It all would have taken too much energy to explain , and it would not have been in his bureaucratic training to comprehend . I urged the driver onward . The rain would soon stop , but the traffic had already been brought to a waterlogged standstill . I had an appointment in Quezon City that had taken me more than thirty years to arrange . And I had no desire , ever again in my life , to try and explain to resistant ears what led up to those final hours that left Tomoyuki Yamashita dangling from a rope at Los Banos.
