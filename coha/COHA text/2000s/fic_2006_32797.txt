Chapter One Flotsam The storm wrecked Sam 's carefully planned solitude . The next morning , Sam hiked to the small beach below her house to see the damage . She followed a trail through the redwoods , those ancient trees that stood like sentinels around her property . They had been growing on this remote stretch of California coast for centuries , even millennia . Mist softened her view of the trunks as if a gauzy shroud hung over the green-needled branches with their dark cones . The world had become muted after the fury of last night 's thunder , rain , and winds . Sam came out onto the beach under an overcast sky the color of pewter . Seagulls cried as they wheeled beneath the clouds . Through the shreds of fog that hung over the beach , she saw the sea , a froth of green and ivory cream , thick and restless . Flotsam from last night 's storm had scattered across the beach in soggy clumps . Sam walked past driftwood and kelp , her hands scrunched in the pockets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled its heating system and warmed her body , but the chill air on her face bit like ice . So Samantha Abigail Harriet Bryton wandered across her private stretch of sand , hidden from the rest of the coast by cliffs that cupped the beach and extended promontories into the water . She felt at home here . Her name made her think of the cocktail parties , society pages , and chic clothes of her parents ' world , or else a pair of spectacles hanging off the end of her nose . None of those qualities described her , except perhaps the last , before surgery had corrected her vision . To escape all that , she just went by Sam . Contrary to its reputation as a sunshine state , California had weather that turned cold and foggy up here near the Oregon border . Sam missed the warmer climates down south , but she had no wish to return to the hard-edged , fast-paced world she had fled . She had begun to heal these past six months since she had left the biotech corridors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than face a life that compromised her sense of right and wrong . Wind blew her mane of shaggy yellow curls across her eyes . She passed rocky tidal pools with orange starfish draped across them , half in the water . Tiny octopuses hid under the rocks . Oystercatchers strutted among the pools , foraging for limpets and mussels , their red beaks fluorescent against the dull gray morning . Waves rolled into the beach , mottled in blue , green , and foamy white , swirling across the sand and rounded stones . Most petered out a few feet short of where she walked , but some came far enough to eddy around her hiking boots and soak the ankles of her jeans . The icy water gave her a jolt . Sam felt one of her moods coming on , the desire to rebel against the technology she had forsworn when she resigned her job last year . This morning she had deliberately left her mesh glove on her desk at home , and she had ripped the chips out of her clothes . Well , all except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be completely uncivilized . She supposed she was n't rebelling all that much , given that her ability to communicate with the world was only half a mile away , in her house among the redwoods . But she valued her isolation here , on the wild beauty of her beach . Last night 's storm had left a mess , though : tree branches rounded into smooth shapes , shards of wood , a broken ring made from metal , tatters of cloth , bits of machinery ? Cloth ? Machinery ? Sam went over to a pile of metal fragments . They definitely came from a human-built object , possibly a ship . Uneasy , she peered out at the ocean . The mist obscured her view , but she thought more debris was bobbing beyond the breakers , in the swells rolling toward shore . The water had never had this much junk , not even after other storms . Curious now , she stripped to her underwear and blouse , goose bumps rising on her skin in the cold air . Drawing in a deep breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah ! " Sam gasped as waves crashed around her knees and sprayed water into her face . Exhilarated , she spread her feet wide , bracing herself against the force of the waves and the slight undertow that tried to pull her under . She loved the ocean , loved its power and surging beauty , even its chill temperature , surely no more than fifty degrees now . Usually she jogged in the morning , but today she would swim instead . She could n't stay in too long ; a few minutes would invigorate her , but any longer without a wetsuit and she risked hypothermia . Her muscles tightened as she forged onward . Water swelled around her thighs , her waist , and higher , and she had to jump with the waves to keep from being knocked over . When it reached her breasts , she began to swim , riding up a swell and down the other side as it rolled past . After the first shock of the water , her body was adapting , which made the chill recede . Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she submerged , her body tingling from cold . She jumped through the next waves . In the valley between the swells , she swam with powerful strokes , until she made it past the point where the waves no longer broke . Now that she could see the debris more clearly , she caught her lower lip with her teeth . This was the wreckage of a vessel , possibly a small yacht given the quality of wood floating around her . She found a section of metal with a date stamp : July 2032 . That made it less than a year old . She stroked past broken planking , baffled . This had been a bad storm , yes , but it should n't have wrecked a vessel . If the yacht had smashed against the rocks north of here , the pieces would have been more dispersed now , unless it had happened on a promontory right here , this morning . She peered at the cliff jutting into the water a few hundred meters to the north . Although she saw no indication a ship had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the debris this way . The overcast was beginning to clear , and a V-shape of birds flying south made dark lines against the sky . From behind her , watery sunlight slanted through the mist . The cold had begun to bother Sam ; perhaps it was time to head back in to shore . Then an anomaly caught her attention . A glint came from farther out , different from the many ways sun reflected off seawater . With a powerful kick , she headed for it , stroking through the chill water . She soon saw what caused the reflection . A large section of hull floated out here . The remains of a metal rail hung off one side and some cloth had caught on the wood . With dismay , Sam realized the " cloth " was a man sprawled facedown . Water lapped over the makeshift raft , soaking him , bathing his face and then ebbing away . Kicking hard now , afraid the man would drown if he had n't already , Sam came alongside the hull . She grabbed the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his neck . With relief , she felt his pulse , steady but slow under her palm . Sam hoisted herself up and got her elbows onto the raft so she could see better . He was probably in his mid-twenties , with skin and hair so pale , they seemed almost translucent . He looked like a corpse . She might have been wrong about his pulse-but no , he was breathing , low and shallow , unconscious but alive . Sam pushed a straggle of hair out of her face . She had to get him to shore fast ; he could die of exposure out here . Towing him on the raft would probably be safest ; although she had taken a lifesaving course in college , that had been twenty years ago and she was n't certain she could keep his head above the water without help . Sliding into the ocean , she hooked her arm over the metal rail and pulled the rough underside of the hull onto her hip . Then she headed for the shore , using a side kick she practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she had thought . Towing in the makeshift raft was harder than she expected . She struggled through the water , making so little headway that she questioned if she could reach the shore . For every few feet she gained , the waves grew larger , which moved her forward but made it harder to control the raft . Her arms tired , and her legs ached with the strain of kicking hard enough to propel the hull . She might soon be too cold to pull even herself through the water , let alone the raft . She could drown . Sam thought of releasing the raft and swimming into the beach . She would run for help . But it was no good ; if this man died because she could n't get him to the shore in time , she could n't live with herself . Keep going . The swells continued to grow . She rode up the back of one , higher and higher , four or five feet into the air . Wind blew across her soaked blouse and she shivered . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she threw her arms over the raft , grabbing the man , holding him tight on the water-soaked hull . Then the wave crashed down in a whirl of froth and seaweed , throwing the raft with it , battering them with bits of debris . Sam clung to the precariously tilting hull , covering the man as best she could . She prayed he did n't breathe in too much water . The wave rolled on , leaving them in the valley between swells . Mercifully , the raft had n't flipped . The next wave loomed above her , but this time she was better positioned to catch it . She scrambled onto the hull , lying across it and the man , ready to ride into shore as she had often done as a child on mini surfboards . She had lost her touch , though . The wave curled over in a pipe and crashed on top of her , wrenching away the raft . The backlash caught Sam and she floundered under the water , buffeted on all sides . Holding her breath , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom , she pushed off with a great shove and shot up until she flew out of the water up to her hips . On another day , it would have been fun , but right now she could think only about the injured man . She caught the next breaker and body surfed into shore . As the wave dwindled into a tame wash , she jumped up and ran through the foam and tangles of kelp . The raft had swept up a few yards away , its passenger lying across it , his hair plastered against his head . Sam 's clothes lay crumpled in a heap a few hundred yards farther up the beach . Sam sped to the raft and dropped down next to it , shaking with the cold . When she felt the man 's pulse under her hand , she gulped with relief . At least she had n't drowned him . With barely a pause , she scrambled to her feet , ran to her clothes , scooped up her jacket , and raced back . Sand flew as she skidded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She spread her jacket over the man , covering as much of him as possible with the heat-controlled garment . Right now he needed the warmth far more than she did . Her check showed no obvious sign of injury . His slender , athletic build made her think of a runner , and his white pants and shirt could have come from a sports rack in any department store . He carried no wallet or mesh glove . The bluish tinge of his lips frightened her ; he could die of the cold as easily as by drowning . Sam sat back on her heels . Her house was half a mile away , up a rocky trail . She lived miles from her nearest neighbor , and she had purposely left her glove at home . Rejecting technology was all well and fine as long as she did n't need it . She could have linked her glove into the local mesh and called in help . She did n't want to leave the man here while she ran to the house . Although she had paid an exorbitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , right now she would have given anything for a trespasser to show up . Well , she had to do something or she would freeze herself , which would n't help him any . She could sprint home for her glove and make the contact while she ran back here . Sam leaned over the man and brushed his dripping hair back from his face . " I do n't know if you can hear me , but I will be back as soon as I can . I promise . " The man groaned . Startled , Sam sat back . He opened his eyes , his gaze unfocused , his wet lashes making star patterns around his blue eyes . It seemed odd he would awake now , when he had been drifting in the water for who knew how long . Then again , if anything could jolt him awake , her onerous method of hauling him in to shore probably fit the bill . Or maybe her voice stirred his response . Whatever the reason , he was conscious . " Can you hear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face blank . Sam set her hand on his shoulder . His wet shirt felt thin under her palm . " Are you hurt ? " No answer . She was even more uncertain now whether to leave or stay . A wave swirled around them , reminding her the tide was coming in . Standing up , she tried to drag the raft farther up the beach , but without the buoyancy of the water , she had a lot more trouble . After pulling it only a few inches , she had to stop , her arms aching . Her rescued prince did n't stir , and her concern was edging into alarm . Sam knelt next to him . " Can you move at all ? " She expected him to continue staring at nothing , but this time he did move , pushing up on his elbows and lifting his head . With erratic motions , he leaned his weight on one hand and nudged a dripping lock of hair out of his eyes . He jerked eerily , as if he were a marionette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white trousers . The cloth had turned translucent in the water , delineating the planes of his chest . He was obviously in good shape . " Hello , " Sam said . His eyes scanned the beach , his head turning until he was looking at her . " Hello ? " he said . " Are you all right ? " she asked . " All right . " Sam could n't tell if he was answering or repeating her question . His face was hard to read . The regular features and smooth skin had an unnatural perfection , like a statue without the character lines or quirks created by life . " Can you tell me what happened ? " she asked . He tilted his head . Sam tried again . " Is anyone else out there ? " No answer . Maybe he had hurt his head during the wreck . " I can go back to my house and call a doctor . " More to herself than him , she added , " I think I should . " She rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the jacket on . I 'll be back with help . " " No . " That one word seemed to cause him great effort . With labored movements , he rose to his feet . He was n't too tall , only about five foot eight , half a foot taller than Sam . She watched him with concern . " You should sit . " " Please do n't call a doctor . " His eyes never blinked . That made her wary . " Why not ? " " I feel fine . " He did n't look fine . " Are you sure , Mister ... ? Continues ...
