Saturn and Jupiter rise to prominence as the Geminids hit their peak . by Martin Ratcliffe and Alister Ling // &gt; The sky 's crown jewel , Saturn , is well placed for observing in mid-evening . On December 17 , the Ringed Planet lies opposite the Sun and rises in the east at sunset , hence the term opposition . Its steady yellow ember is at its brightest because the glorious ring system is tilted at its maximum toward us . You may never see Saturn at a better time . Not far behind , the bright beacon Jupiter - the largest planet - is relatively high in the east by late evening . Eager observers who sneak a peek too early , though , are bound for disappointment from the turbulent view caused by Earth 's lower atmosphere . It 's always fun to watch shadows on Jupiter 's cloud tops , and this month there are some chances to catch pairs of shadows . The big event this month , if you have tickets in hand , is the total solar eclipse from southern Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next affordable total-eclipse chase is more than three years away across Africa and Asia . Get ready for a night of bright shooting stars : The Geminids hit their maximum on December 13/14 at 4 A.M. EST . Just before dawn under a dark country sky you 'll probably see more than 80 meteors per hour . This may seem like a mere drizzle compared to the roaring Leonids last month , but as one of the year 's best , the Geminids offer a good consolation if you were clouded out of the action in November . Meteors occur when cometary dust slams into Earth 's upper atmosphere  --  the Geminids typically burn up at a fiery rate of 22 miles per second ( 35 km/s ) . The dust that causes the Geminids is denser than that of other meteor showers and , consequently , yields lots of bright streaks and trains visible in binoculars . Mercury returns to the evening sky toward the end of the month . The speedy little inner planet appears surprisingly bright if you have n't seen it before . The trick is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right place . You 're lucky in that there are no nearby stars bright enough to steer you astray . Early risers looking east about 6 A.M. local time will already be familiar with the brilliant morning star - our sister planet Venus . But this month , there 's something new . If you 're wondering what the nearby orange star is , surprise - it 's Mars . All month , the fainter rusty fleck floats in the same binocular field as the blazing white Venus . Note the contrast between ruddy Mars and blue-white Spica to its upper right . The crescent Moon adds a touch of class on the mornings of the 1st and 30th . Observers in Japan on the 30th can witness the Moon move in front of Mars . Winter in the Northern Hemisphere officially begins on December 21 at 8:14 P.m . EST , though in many places the snow has already settled in . The solstice marks the shortest day of the year , when the Sun reaches its southernmost point in the sky among the now invisible stars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise at sunset - mute testimony to winter 's upcoming reign . The Owl and the Cigar Photograph Saturn appears bigger and brighter than at any time in the past 30 years . NASA and the Hubble Heritage Team ( STScI/AURA ) Photograph December Photograph December Photograph December Photograph December // As if 25 years ago was last week , the view of the Owl Nebula is still sharp and fresh in my mind 's eye . With my 4.5  --  inch Tasco reflector , I knew I had either discovered a comet or found the Owl . It just could n't be the nebula , I thought , because it was supposed to be one of the toughest objects in the Messier catalog to see . But with further observation I knew M97 sure was n't a comet . What I saw is emblazoned in my memory : a slightly offset baseball diamond with the nebula at home plate . A telltale photograph at our club 's observatory quickly confirmed that it was the planetary nebula , nestled just below the bowl of the Big Dipper . These ethereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying star , but in a small telescope they often resemble ghostly cousins of gas giant planets . The lesson I took with me from this incident of astronomical mistaken identity was that you ca n't always trust a guidebook 's description . I think you 'll find that the large dark eyes that give the nebula its name are a challenge even in larger telescopes . From the suburbs I 've been able to just barely see the Owl in a 4.5-inch scope , but a high contrast filter makes it much easier . Just before this writing , the Owl 's low-power neighbor - the edge-on , starburst galaxy M108 - was invisible through a veil of light pollution . But with good skies and patiently acquired observing skill , there is a lot to see in M108 . At first I picked up at 35x what I thought was the stellar nucleus of the cigar  --  shaped object . But after bumping the power up to 145x in my 4.5-inch scope , I noticed the star is not actually at the center of M108 , so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the trick observers use to better capture faint objects - M108 appeared brighter in the middle next to a darker patch with another lighter blob on the following side . Photograph Photograph Two dark , circular patches give the Owl Nebula its nickname . James McGaha Photograph The edge-on spiral galaxy M 108 is experiencing a burst of star formation . David Ratledge // If you get a chance to see M108 in a large scope , do n't miss it . The surface detail begins to pop out as the mottled texture becomes increasingly defined . The darker patches are caused by an enormous amount of dust blocking radiation from the core , electrified by hundreds of supernovae . M108 is a starburst galaxy , yet no power-producing supernova has been seen within it . When a massive star runs out of fuel , it collapses and blows itself apart with an energy output rivaling the radiative emissions of its entire parent galaxy . But the dust enshrouding this particular edge-on galaxy is so thick that even a prodigious intensity of light is absorbed . With a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearing in the dust to give observers a treat . In December , Saturn reaches its best opposition since the early 1970s . It is now brighter than it 's been in years , shining at magnitude - 0.5 . That means it outshines all the stars in the sky except Sirius the Dog Star , which shines a full magnitude brighter , and Canopus , which lies deep in the southern sky . Jupiter also joins the winter planetary feast , rising in the eastern sky in late evening . By the middle of December , the fluttering streaks of the Geminid meteor shower should appear . The shower 's radiant lies midway between the two giant planets . So there are astronomical events all month to capture the imagination and pique curiosity . Photograph Saturn 's rings now tip wide open , making details easier to see . SO-Telescope , NAOJ // Before you turn your scope to Saturn , do a final check on Uranus as soon as the sky darkens . At magnitude 5.9 , it 's easy to find even with binoculars . It glows to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delta ) ) Capricorni . This month Uranus lies quite close to the 5.1-magnitude star Mu ( ( mu ) ) Cap . Later in December the gas giant falls lower in the western sky and gets lost in the evening twilight . Once Uranus falls from view , turn to the opposite side of the sky to catch Saturn sitting above the eastern horizon . From night to night throughout the month , you can track the planet 's motion as it moves toward Zeta ( zeta ) ) Tauri , one of the " horns " of Taurus the Bull . By the end of December , Saturn lies within the same field of view as the Crab Nebula ( M1 ) . It will cross in front of the nebula in early January . The opposition date for Saturn is December 17 . By definition , Saturn then lies exactly opposite the Sun in the sky , and so appears due south at local midnight . The planet is also eight months away from perihelion , its closest approach to the Sun . Consequently , Saturn appears at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disk also appears at its largest at opposition , spanning 21 " . The rings extend this girth to 47 " along their major axis . The minor axis of the rings varies in width throughout Saturn 's orbit around the Sun , depending on our viewing angle . Sometimes disappearing when they 're edge-on , the rings ' minor axis currently spans 21 " , the maximum possible when viewed from Earth . An opposition with Saturn at a relatively close 748.5 million miles from Earth is a good time to catch some saturnian satellites . Titan is the brightest at magnitude 8.3 , and may be spotted orbiting Saturn nearly twice this month . During the first few days of December , Titan passes south of the planet . Then for a period of three to four days each following its southern passage , you 'll find Titan first to Saturn 's east , then north , west , and back to south again , a cycle repeating every 16 days . This month you can watch one of the moons fade as it orbits Saturn . Iapetus varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at magnitude 10.2 when west of the Ringed Planet and magnitude 11.9 to its east . During December Iapetus travels from the west of Saturn on December 1 , when it shines at its brightest , to the east of the planet by year 's end , dimming as it goes . See if you can detect the fade . The change in brightness results from half of Iapetus being much darker than the opposite hemisphere . Iapetus orbits Saturn with the same face pointing toward the planet , just like our Moon does as it circles Earth . Consequently , the hemisphere we see of Iapetus constantly changes during its orbit . Other moons within reach of 6-inch scopes ( some with smaller scopes ) are Tethys , Dione , and Rhea , in order of increasing distance from the planet . They shine at magnitude 10.2 , 10.4 , and 9.7 , respectively . With an 8-inch scope , Mimas , glowing at magnitude 12.9 , should be visible under good sky conditions . Of all saturnian satellites visible in amateur scopes , Mimas lies closest to the Ringed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon after 10 P.M. local time for observers near a latitude of 400 north . By midnight it stands clear of the horizon , which enables reasonably good views through a telescope . Above Jupiter lies the pair of stars Castor and Pollux in Gemini the Twins . They rise two hours before Jupiter . By the end of the month , things improve for early evening viewing because Jupiter rises more than two hours earlier . At magnitude - 2.4 , Jupiter outshines Saturn , and scintillates like a stunning jewel between the constellations Leo and Cancer . Even nearby Regulus - one of the four ist-magnitude stars along the ecliptic - appears dim in comparison . During December Jupiter 's apparent diameter grows by nearly 10 percent , reaching 44 " across on the 31st . The planet 's apparent size will continue to grow until it reaches opposition this coming February . During the next four months , the best of this gas giant is on display . During the long , dark hours of winter nights the entire globe of Jupiter can be observed in one night ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter as soon as it climbs to a decent altitude . Small telescopes will reveal the major features of the jovian atmosphere : the equatorial belts , the Great Red Spot , and dark Photograph With Jupiter now approaching opposition , look for ever-increasing details in its cloud belts . Kim ZuSsman Photograph // spots . Larger scopes will show more subtle features like the delicate , fine-structured belts , smaller spots , and festoons . Check the planet every 30 minutes or so and the features will have moved noticeably . Some four hours later the hemisphere visible in the early evening will be on the far side of the planet and you 'll enjoy an entirely new hemisphere . Watching such a parade requires patience , one of the attributes of a good observer . Developing an expert eye for details simply requires practice . You can begin practicing right away . You will find the experience rewarding - even more so if you carefully record what you see . The relative positions of the jovian satellites vary from night to night , and we see the result as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals which moon is which . lo orbits Jupiter most rapidly , in less than two days , followed by Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto . Callisto takes more than 16 days to orbit the planet once . Venus and Mars continue their attractive morning conjunction in the predawn sky . A fine crescent Moon joins the pair on December 1 . Set your alarm on November 30 for the early morning hours to catch Venus standing 20 south of the Moon . Mars stands just 20 west of Venus . Before dawn the trio shines some 80 east of Spica , the brightest star in the constellation Virgo the Maiden . Venus glows at magnitude - 4.6 . With a telescope , follow the fattening crescent as the illuminated portion visible to earthbound observers grows from 21 percent to 44 percent . Simultaneously , the apparent size of the venusian disk shrinks from 44 " to 28 " as the planet recedes from Earth . Mars remains diminutive this month , spanning only 4 " . Few surface details can be seen on such a small disk . Watching it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting aspect of the Red Planet during December , as it brightens slightly during the month to magnitude 1.6 . Catching Gems This regular meteor shower peaks over a weekend this year . Conditions should be favorable for North American observers - if skies are clear , of course . Early on the morning of December 14 , many bright meteors will streak across the sky . By drawing the trails back along their track , you can identify the position of the radiant . As its name indicates , the shower radiates from a point within the constellation Gemini the Twins . Conditions are good for the Geminids once the gibbous Moon sets , shortly after 1:30 A.M. local time on December 14 . With the radiant high in the sky , large numbers of meteors should be visible . The expected hourly rate if the radiant were directly overhead in a pitch-black sky is 120 meteors per hour . Actual observed rates will be less than this figure . But even lower rates will produce , on average , at least one meteor per minute under ideal conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a town or city with significant light pollution , likely cutting the number seen down by at least half of the rate for observers at a dark , clear site . The best place to look is about 50 up from the horizon and at least 40 away from the radiant . This shower would be as well known as the Perseids if not for its occurrence during the cold winter months . However , if you brave the chill you can expect an exciting night that many less adventurous observers will miss . The peak lasts for quite a long time , with the shower active up to 10 hours on either side of the peak , so most of the world should get a decent show . You can see Geminid stragglers for up to 10 days , from December 7 to 17 . A Lunar Harbinger The ancient flooded terrain of Oceanus Procellarum is home to the Harbinger Mountains ( Montes Harbinger ) . This cluster of mountains lies northeast of the brilliant crater Aristarchus . Near the mountains lies the incomplete crater Prinz , a 29-mile-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago . During sunrise across this area many subtle features , such as domes and rilles , become easily observable under the low-angled lighting . An extended rille runs from the northeastern wall of Prinz out to the west and then turns abruptly north . Aristarchus and Schroter 's Valley tend to overshadow this region , but closer scrutiny will offer a look at an almost buried ancient feature of the lunar landscape . Watch for sunrise around the region on December 16 . Photograph On December 4 , parts of Africa and Australia will see a total solar eclipse . Jeffrey C. Bell Photograph The isolated Harbinger Mountains lie near the prominent crater Aristarchus . David Mansbridge A Geminid meteor pierces the heart of Orion the Hunter . Mirco Villa // Into the Moon 's Shadow Few sights match the almost other  --  worldly beauty of a total solar eclipse . Eclipse chasers often travel great distances for a fleeting glimpse of the Sun 's ethereal corona and darkness at midday . Well , unless you live in southern Africa or Australia , it 's time to pack your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sun along a narrow swath that crosses parts of Angola , Zambia , Namibia , Botswana , Zimbabwe , South Africa , and Mozambique . After a long trek across the Indian Ocean , the Moon 's shadow touches land again in South Australia . The eclipse ends at sunset near the border between New South Wales and Queensland . Totality lasts at most 1 minute and 32 seconds in Africa , and just 33 seconds in Australia . However , weather prospects favor Australia , where late autumn usually brings hot , sunny , and dry days . A Fly on the Bear 's Back Destined to remain out of the headlines , Comet C/2001 RX14 ( LINEAR ) will nonetheless provide a nice diversion for galaxy hunters in Ursa Major . Its soft roundish glow should brighten past 1I th magnitude , well within reach of a small scope under a dark sky . With memories of spring 's Ikeya  --  Zhang to keep you warm , pick a dark , moonless night anytime in the first week of December . Because it 's so far north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for observers in much of the Northern Hemisphere . However , it grazes the horizon in the evening , so you 'll have to wait until at least midnight to have it rise above the horizon murk . Its path almost parallels the bottom of the Big Dipper 's bowl , bringing it close to the modestly bright galaxy NGC 3877 near the bright star Chi ( ( chi ) ) UMa . RX14 ( LINEAR ) is just P south of the galaxy on the nights of December 20 through 22 , but the almost Full Moon makes this a lesser event for visual observers . On the other hand , it 's worth getting to know NGC 3877 in its own right . At magnitude 11 , this galaxy 's long axis spans 5 ' ' . Bump up the power because it lies less than one moonwidth south of Chi UMa . On the New Moon weekend of December 6 , the comet shares the same low-power field as the 12th-magnitude galaxy NGC 3595 . Compare their shapes and textures , and use at least a 6-inch scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull 's Back Thanks to its fairly eccentric orbit , the main belt asteroid 349 Dembowska is now much closer to Earth than usual , which means it 's brighter than its discovery number would suggest . This month the 10th-magnitude space rock is well within the reach of a small scope from the city suburbs . Jump up to northern Taurus and the 5th-magnitude star Psi ( ( psi ) ) Tauri , about a binocular field northeast of the Pleiades . Then use the chart to zero in on the rock , which has a diameter of 90 miles ( 140 km ) . With an albedo of 0.34 , meaning it reflects 34 percent of the sunlight that hits it , Dembowska is as reflective as Earth and some seven times more so than the Moon . Because there are a number of background stars of similar brightness , do n't jump on the first suspect . Make a quick sketch of the field stars and then come back in a night or two to see which one has moved . If you have an 8-inch telescope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NGC 1514 a shot . It 's located not quite 2 deg north of Psi Tau . If conditions are good , you should see a patchy pale circular disk surrounding a 9th-magnitude central star .
