The week junior died , the temperature dropped to fourteen below and stayed there . The seats on my Honda felt like they were made of plywood , and the engine groaned before turning over , a low sound like some Japanese movie monster waking up after a thousand-year sleep . I had long underwear on under my suit , but I could still feel my legs numbing up . Four miles to the funeral parlor , and the heater never did kick in . <p> After it was over , we all went back to Louise 's for food . There was a big ham her sister , June , had brought down from Madison , and the girls , Maddy and Chris , were there with their husbands and kids . Louise had made chicken and seven-layer salad and brownies , and there was plenty to drink , too . I went to work on some wine and also took responsibility for the music . I played Willie Nelson 's Stardust album , because I remembered Junior had liked it , and because I did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it and pointed out toward the porch , where a lone person stood all bundled up smoking a cigarette . " What am I supposed to do now ? " she said . <p> " We all knew this was coming . It has to be a bit of a relief . " I did n't quite know what she was driving at . <p> " Not about Junior-that is a relief . " She pointed again . " I mean about him . About Clay . " <p> I sipped some more wine . It was good stuff-better than I 'd buy for myself . I get the Mediterranean red , which is cheap but drinkable . " A man who 'll step outside for a cigarette in this weather has to really love to smoke " I said . " I might join him : ' <p> " I do n't think he has any plans , " she said . " Neither of them did . And now that Junior is gone , I 'm afraid he 's just going to stay . " All along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Clay and Junior . They 'd met at a support group-I knew that . Coffee , cookies , a musty room in the basement of some school . The spring before , with Junior 's health deteriorating fast , he 'd moved back into the house , and Clay had come along . They looked the sameskinny and getting skinnier , big , hollowed-out eyes . Going through the same hell , it was easier to have each other there . I do n't believe they were being boyfriends together , exactly-they were both too weak . Mostly , they watched TV , drank sodas , and smoked cigarettes , counted out each other 's pills . It was a good thing that Clay was around , particularly these last months , since it took some of the burden off Louise . But now I could see the problem . <p> " Ca n't he go home to his people ? " <p> " His people do n't want him . They disowned him a long time ago . <p> " Maybe he should have thought about that when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't go through it all again . You do n't know how bad it was . With your own son , that 's one thing . A person can do it . But I 'm really afraid . You know how you read about old people , and when their spouse dies , they just suddenly lose their own desire to live ? " She looked at me . Our problems were different . I had drunk myself out of this marriage ten years ago , but it did n't mean we were n't in love . <p> " You think he 's going to die now ? " <p> " I do n't think it , I know it . And I wo n't have it happen here . There 's only so much a person can do . " <p> " What do you want from me ? " I said . <p> " Tell him he has to leave . " <p> I looked out at the figure on the porch . It was cold enough to freeze birds right out of the air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of moving right beyond his body " Me ? " <p> " Please , Lenny ? " she said . <p> The twins , Kayla and Kaylin , ran past us giggling , each of them clutching ham sandwiches . " Those girls sure can eat , " I said . " Maddy might want to think about putting them on a diet . " <p> I used to have a nice little house-painting business . After I sold that , I drove truck for R. C. Reynolds up in Cedar Rapids , mostly routes in the Midwest . Paper products . Then I started to get back trouble , LA and L-5 to be exact , and at fifty I went on disability . I was already out of the house , set up in my own place out here by the river . It flooded the first year , bad , and you can still see the marks on walls where the water came to . I drank beer at the time , and I remember how when I came back from a week on Louise 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in the middle of the living room like barrel-shaped aluminum fish . Insurance eventually took care of most of it , but I learned fast that life by myself was n't necessarily going to be a big bachelor party . <p> My second day in the house , before the flood , Louise came by with a bunch of dinners in Tupperware , each labeled neatly across the top : " Lasagna , " " Meatloaf , " " Soup Beans , " and " Chinese ! I did n't know what she meant by that last one , and I never did open it to see what was inside . It 's still there . When I want Chinese , I 'll usually go into town and head to Ding 's for the lunch special . <p> For a couple of days after the funeral , I thought about it . I did n't want to get involved , particularly , but I did want to be helpful . This Clay person and I had at least one thing in common , which was that we 'd been disowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my case it was drinking and causing scenes , in his it was having sex with men . We did n't have to do these things . I knew that Junior 's getting sick was more or less inevitable . Before he ever turned up back in Iowa City from San Francisco , I figured there was something wrong . He was still healthy then , still shiny and optimistic , talking about how he was going to write children 's books , signing up for classes at the University . But I understood why he was back , and Louise did , too . And when he started to lose weight and get sick , we did n't ever even say the word , but we all knew . He was taking almost forty pills a day by the end . <p> I went by to see Clay . It was a weekday , and Louise was at work up at the hospital . I had a drink first , of course-Early Times on the rocks . It was good , but it did n't prepare me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun shining , the air was like a smack in the face . The river was solid as concrete , and the spidery limbs of the naked trees made me think of cracks in a windshield . I wondered if weather like this made them shut down completely , or if underneath it all they were still growing . <p> Clay was watching television in the living room . " Hey , " he said , when I came in . <p> " Hey yourself . " I stood over him . His cigarettes were on the coffee table , along with a can of Pepsi and a partially completed crossword puzzle . He was in jeans and a short-sleeved shirt that was too big for him , and that it occurred to me might have been one of my old ones . " You want to get out of here for a while ? Go get one of them three-dollar coffees ? " <p> He grinned , showing teeth as yellow as a horse 's . He needed a shave , too . " All right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We did n't talk in the car . I found a space right out front to the Coffee Company , fed the meter a couple of quarters , and we went in . He got a cappuccino , and I had a Siddartha , which the sign translated as " breakfast blend . " <p> " That 's a novel by Hesse " Clay said . <p> " I know it . " We headed away from the counter up front and back into an unoccupied sofa that looked like it had come straight from some old lady 's attic without any vacuuming in between . He sat on that , and I settled onto a chair opposite . There was a little table in between us . " It 's still a dumb name for a cup of coffee . " Someone walked past us with a teapot on a tray . " You know what ' chai ' is ? " I said . " It 's Japanese for ' tea : You order ' chai tea , ' that 's like asking for a ' sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was relatively quiet-a couple of tables away a grad-student type was clicking away at his laptop . A middle-aged woman was reading a book . Light jazz drifted down from hidden speakers somewhere above us . <p> " I think I can guess what this is about , " Clay said , finally . <p> " What ? " <p> " Well , when Louise had that trouble with the dishwasher , she called you to come look at it . And you fixed it the next day . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " And you fixed that step out front last fall . " <p> " I can do a couple of things . " <p> " You want me to go . " <p> " It 's not me that wants it , exactly . " <p> " Right . I get it . " <p> I was thinking how easy this was . He understood the situation . I took another sip of coffee and felt something nice and comfortable kick in , like it does after the first drink of the evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen ? " <p> Clay leaned forward . I could see all the bones in his face . <p> " Lenny , " he said . " There is no place . " <p> " Sure there is . Do n't you have a friend you could stay with ? " His eyes held on to mine . " Junior was my friend . Junior was everything . " <p> " I appreciate that . But Junior is gone . You knew this was going to happen-both of you did . Did n't you ever talk about it ? Did n't you ever plan ? " <p> " No " he said . " We did n't plan . " <p> " Well , that was n't that smart , then , was it ? " " Maybe not . " <p> " You ca n't expect my wife to take care of you : ' <p> " I wo n't bother anyone . She wo n't even notice I 'm there . " " What are you going to do ? " <p> " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about . There was really just one thing I did up until last week , and that was take care of Junior . Without him , I 'm kind of at a loss . ' He laughed nervously . He had a very deep voice , croaky from all the smoking he did . <p> " What about your folks ? " <p> " They do n't know where I am , and they never will . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . " It sounds like a tough situation . I 'm just here to tell you that you need to find alternate accommodations . Let 's say in a week , all right ? Louise-my wife-this past year has been hard on her , as you can imagine . " <p> " You think this has n't been hard on me ? " For a second , I saw something rise up in him , a tough-sonofabitch independence that turned on a yellow light in his dead eyes , then went away . I recognized it , and I respected it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to the corner of his mouth . <p> " I tell you what I said . " You can come camp with me , temporarily . The important thing is that we get you out of Louise 's hair . It 's not a permanent solution , but I can live with it for a little while . " After I 'd said it , I was a little sorry . But it was out there , and I was n't going to take it back . <p> " I do n't think so . " He stared down at the table . " Where will you go , then ? " <p> He did n't answer . His face looked all clammy . <p> " You okay ? " <p> " Coffee is hard on my stomach . " <p> " Then you should n't drink it . " <p> " I like to drink it . " <p> " I 'm giving you an out here , " I said . " Be careful , because I do n't have to do it . But I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " All right , " he said , so quietly , I could barely hear . <p> I dropped Clay back at Louise 's and told him he could move in the next day . Then I went to the library and did some reading . After that I headed over to the Deadwood and drank a couple more Early Times and started chatting up Nicole , the bartender . She 's got enormous patience when it comes to me . One time she even drove me home , and it 's not remotely on her way . I was so drunk , apparently , I started reciting Shakespeare , and I do n't know any . She put me to bed and everything . <p> " Cold enough for you ? " I said . <p> " Come on , Lenny , " she said . " I do n't get paid enough to listen to ' cold enough for you . ' " <p> " You ever know anyone with AIDS ? " <p> " Yeah . " She lit up a cigarette and offered me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Graduated a few years ago with a degree in art , still trying to figure out what to do with it . " Why ? " <p> " I 'm taking in a roommate . Friend of my son 's . " <p> " I 'm so sorry . I heard about him . " <p> " It 's okay . Life was n't treating him so good . Now we got this other guy on our hands , see . You think it might be dangerous ? " <p> " Not if you practice safe sex . " <p> " That 's not even funny . I mean silverware and stuff . Dishes . Just breathing the same air . Stuff hangs . I saw this program once where they showed what a sneeze does . Droplets in the air . You ever heard of ' HAART ' ? " <p> " ' Heart ' like valentines ? Like the kind that are always getting broken ? " <p> " It stands for ' Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy . " ' <p> " I know some of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . " <p> " You mean pills . " <p> I nodded and pointed to my glass , which was empty . I could feel a pretty good glow getting started , too , and I had an idea . The Early Times bottle behind the bar was about half full . I decided I would spend the afternoon killing it off and that would be itafter that I was through with drinking . I 'd always known that someday I 'd quit , and today seemed as good as any other . " I know a little something about the cocktail approach myself , " I said . <p> Nicole smiled prettily . She had on big hoop earrings and a black turtleneck that showed off those small , high breasts of hers . <p> " What do you know about it ? " <p> " I know that it only works for so long . " <p> I spent the whole afternoon at the Deadwood . Around dinner time , I drunk-drove over to the house , passing by the time and temperature sign outside the First National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark sky . As I parked , I was conscious of all the normal lives around me in those 1920's-era houses , and I leaned on my horn just to wake them up a little . Ours was on Bank Street , a nice screened porch out front that I 'd done quite a bit of work on over the yearsjacked it up where it sagged , painted it , put in new steps . Louise 's car was in the driveway-we drive the same model , though hers is a few years newer-so I knew she was home . I also knew she would n't want to see me like this , but that never stopped me before . <p> She was in the kitchen , but she came out to the living room when she heard me come in . She 'd changed out of her work clothes into jeans and a big green T-shirt , and she had a knife in her hand . " Was that you honking ? " she said . <p> " Hell , no . Louis Armstrong is out there . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' <p> " You are sauced . Go on home . And try not to kill anyone on the way . " <p> " I 'm celebrating . " <p> " What ? " She gave me a puzzled look . " What are you celebrating ? Did the price of whiskey go down ? " She moved past me and gave the door a shove , since I had n't closed it all the way . " I do n't even want to think about the next heating bill . ' <p> " Where is he ? " I said . <p> " Upstairs , resting . " <p> " I quit drinking this afternoon . " <p> " Go look in the bathroom mirror , then come back and say that again . <p> I needed to go anyway , so I plowed through the kitchen and into the little powder room we have off it . The temperature in there was a good twenty degrees colder than the rest of the house , but the plumbing was n't froze up yet , and the toilet flushed just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his age . Still had all his hair , only some of it gray . Could have used a shave and a haircut . I picked a fleck of something out from between my upper teeth and tried to remember the last thing I 'd had to eat . It looked vegetable , but I did n't think I 'd had any . <p> When I came back out , she was chopping mushrooms . <p> " What 's for dinner ? " <p> " You can take home the rest of that ham Maddy brought . It 's in the fridge . And the seven-layer salad-there 's plenty , and it needs to be eaten soon . Did you do anything at all about what I asked ? " <p> " Asked ? " <p> " Oh , Lenny . " <p> I picked a mushroom off the table and popped it whole into my mouth . " Of course . He 'll be out of here tomorrow . " <p> " He will ? Where is he going ? " <p> " Never mind about that . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Call me for the tough jobs . " The mushroom was dry in my mouth , and I stuck my head under the faucet to get some water to wash it down with . <p> She put down the knife . I saw that she was crying , just a little . " Thank you " she said , in a tiny voice that just about broke me down , too . " You do n't know . " <p> " At least things will be easier for you around here . " <p> " It 's like some strange shadow he left behind . With the wasting , they even look the same . " <p> " It 's okay , " I said , " I 've got everything under control . " I reached out for another mushroom and knocked the entire cutting board to the floor . <p> I slept until noon the next day . Then I called to see if Clay was ready , and he was , so I drove over to pick him up . He was dressed in jeans he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Iowa sweatshirt . He had two duffel bags full of clothes and an oversized leather briefcase . " Going to the office ? " I asked . <p> " Meds , " he said . <p> I stopped at Hy-Vee first so we could get some food , as I did n't have anything around the house . " What do you like ? " I said . " How about we cook up some chili ? Put some meat on those bones of yours . " <p> We bought hamburger , chili mix , beans , canned tomatoes , Minute Rice , a 12-pack of Pepsi , Pop-Tarts , chocolate chip cookies , Steak-Umms , some frozen burritos , and a dozen bananas , among other things . When we passed by the beer aisle , I first looked the other way , then picked out a six of O'Doul 's . My head felt like donkeys had trampled it during the night , but the feeling was n't an unfamiliar one , and in a way , I sort of savored it , since I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were headed for the checkout line , it seemed to me Clay was getting antsy . <p> " They got a bathroom in this place ? " he whispered . <p> " Probably . You got ta go ? " <p> " Uh-huh . Bad . " <p> " Ca n't it wait ? " <p> " I do n't think so . " <p> I flagged down a kid who was on his way to shelve some bread . He pointed back toward Frozen Foods , and Clay hurried off . I paid for the groceries and stood by the entrance reading the little notices posted there on the bulletin board . Tractor for sale . AKCregistered Collie pups . A trailer for rent in Tipton . Hockey skates , barely used , $20. 1 thought about how Junior and I used to skate together sometimes , and then I tried to remember where our skates might be , or if they 'd gotten thrown away somewhere along the line . Finally , Clay showed up . His face did n't have much color to begin with , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You all right ? " I asked . <p> " I do n't really want to talk about it . " <p> " Jesus Christ , " I said . " All right , let 's go . " <p> Clay cleaned himself up , and we had dinner , which I thought came out pretty good . We ate the way I always ate , in front of the television . Afterwards , I dug around the basement and found the skates . I brought them up and asked him what size his feet were . He was in the middle of taking two blue pills . That briefcase of his was divided up into sections , color-coded . Some of the pills had to be taken before meals , some with them , and some after . Others were for first thing in the morning or last thing before bed . <p> " Ten , " he said . <p> " Bingo . " I held out the box . " Try these on . " <p> Something like a smile flickered over his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me of those scrambled cable channels I sometimes found myself watching late at nightmost of the time there 's nothing there , but every now and then , like magic , the picture would come in clear as day . " Junior told me he used to play hockey . I got weak ankles . " <p> " What 's the difference ? " I said . " I got a bad back . We could still lace ' em up and give it a shot for fifteen minutes or so . That river out there , it 's like glass . " <p> " You 're nuts ; " he said . " Look at me . " <p> " Come on . Believe in yourself . " I held out the box , and he took it . Just the effort of lacing them up wore him out-I could see it . <p> He was breathing hard and sweating , and leaning forward he farted , which I made a point of laughing at to make him feel okay . I was sorry . Those ankles were like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazis did . His feet might have been tens , but he still swum in the skates , and it just made me think of Junior , and how I 'd used to take him up to the field house Sundays to play with the Rec league , what a solid young man he 'd been . I started thinking hard about whether I had anything to drink in the house . <p> " I 'm not much of an athlete , " said Clay , attempting to stand . " I play a pretty good game of backgammon , though , if you 've got it . " He teetered for a moment , then fell back onto the sofa . " We going ? " <p> " It 's too cold , " I said . " I do n't know what I was thinking . But maybe if this breaks over the next day or two , and you 're still here , we could . " <p> I set him up in the guest bedroom , and he was asleep by ten . I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my junk , old magazines and fishing tackle , a TV I 'd been trying to repair on and off for years , a dusty 1985 IBM-clone computer ( no hard drive ) and amber monitor that never did work right in the first place , but that I 'd hung on to because I do n't know why . I wondered what the hell I 'd gotten myself into . I was feeling irritable , so I brushed my teeth , and when I was done I swished Listerine around in my mouth , but instead of spitting , I swallowed . That tasted truly awful , but it also gave me a sudden view of myself as no better than those kids you read about huffing paint , so I made myself a pot of coffee and drank half of it while watching a lunatic Australian on television prance around the desert picking up snakes . And all the while , I could feel the cold outside pushing in at the walls . Nature is hostile , no matter how hard we try to convince ourselves the opposite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gone twenty-four hours without a drink in years , and my body was in rebellion . Or maybe it was the flu . My stomach was loose , and I was running a low fever . Clay planted himself in my living room and did pretty much what he 'd been doing back at the house , which was watch daytime TV and smoke , only here he did n't have to go outside . He did a fair amount of coughing , too . For a while , I came out and joined him , and we sat and stared at the shows together-he liked the crime ones , when they were on , but he also did n't mind the talk onesbut then I started to feel shaky again , and I went back to bed . About an hour later I woke up , and he was sitting on the edge of my bed , staring down at me . <p> " What 's your problem ? " I said . <p> " I was just wondering if there 's anything I could do for you " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mix a good martini ? " <p> He laughed . " Probably . It 's been a while . Junior used to tell me about a place he went to in San Francisco-the Zam Zam Room . Some strange old codger bartended , and he made the best martinis on the planet , but you had to be really careful . Like , if you looked at him the wrong way , he 'd throw you out . So you put your money on the bar and just waited to be spoken to . After he made you your drink , he 'd tell you where you were allowed to sit . If you just went to a table and sat without him telling you , that was it-you would n't get served . " <p> " You were n't out in San Francisco ? " I asked . <p> " Me ? No . I grew up in Moline . I never been west of Sioux City . Been to New York a couple of times . I liked that . ' I saw that face of his flicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted no part of . <p> " Okay , listen , " I said . " It 's nice of you to ask , but do n't come in here again without knocking , all right ? " <p> He stood . " That was a joke , then , about the martini ? " <p> There were ants crawling around inside my eyeballs ; I felt all jittery . " I 'm reforming my life , " I told him . " This here what I 'm going through , it 's the necessary pain . " <p> For dinner , we had leftover chili . I washed mine down with two cans of O'Doul 's , and Clay had his usual Pepsi . We were n't talking , we were just eating . Then right in the middle of taking a bite , he put his fork back into his bowl and started to cry . I was n't sure where to look . I had another bite , but what appetite I 'd managed to convince myself I had was gone . There were visible cobwebs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember them next time I vacuumed . <p> " Sorry , " he said , when he 'd more or less pulled himself back together . <p> " Yeah , well . Sometimes it can all get to be a lot . " " I wish I could skate . " He was on verge of losing it again . " I wish a ton of things . I never even got to be in a real love affair . Me and Junior , it was just a couple of young guys in old men 's bodies . " <p> " Hey , hey . This is his father you 're talking to . I do n't need to hear that . " <p> He sniffed , blew his nose into one of the paper towels we were using as napkins . " Why do n't you live at the house with Louise ? " <p> " She asked me to leave . I was n't very reliable . Used to disappear sometimes for a couple of days at a time . I might have hit her once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need ? A project . " <p> " I know it . " <p> " I 'm serious . You ca n't sit around watching TV all the timeyou 'll turn into a blob . What can you do ? " <p> " Nothing , " he said . " Last six months , it was all about Junior . Giving him sponge baths , cleaning up his messes , helping him in and out of bed , just everything . " <p> I 'd been in denial about this . When I had stopped over , which was n't often , they usually had him already out on the sofa , cleaned up and ready to receive visitors . I had n't wanted to know what went on behind the scenes . " You think that 's where you 're headed ? " <p> He stirred his chili and did n't answer . <p> Then I got another idea . I was full of them these days . " What about that book he was working on ? Do you know anything about that ? Maybe you could finish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an artist . I could put you two together . She 's a very good friend . What was it called ? " <p> " A City Dog . Louise has it . " <p> " That 's great . Kids love dog stories . My grandkids do-all of them . Nothing better than a dog story . What do you say ? " <p> " You do n't understand . I have no talent . junior was a good writer . He was musical , too . Some people just are n't born with that . " <p> This was news to me . I tried to think of one musical thing I could remember Junior doing . I tried to think of one thing I could remember him writing . I could vaguely remember some finger paintings on the refrigerator door , but I suspected these were Kayla and Kaylin 's , and it worried me that last week and thirty years ago were n't more clearly separated in my mind . <p> " Well , you think about it . I 'll write down this girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call . Might be a nice tribute to Junior , and maybe you could sell it and make a little money . I 'm guessing you do n't have any , right ? " <p> I could see sweat coming out on his face , and I was conscious of it on my own , too . " I got some in the bank . Not much . I get disability . " <p> " Me , too , " I said . " God bless the government . Will you think about it ? " <p> " Yes , sir , " he said . <p> " That 's all I want to hear . " <p> He went to bed early again , and again I stayed up . This time I watched The African Queen , but seeing Bogart toss back whole mugs of gin made me change over to a biography of Rock Hudson , which was only slightly less depressing . Louise used to tell me I looked like him , back when we were dating , after I got out of the Army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because who would have ever pegged him for gay ? And yet there it was , right on the TV , about how he was going out to sex places and bath houses , and all the while pretending that he was married to that sexy Susan St. James . Louise had n't known the first thing about Rock Hudson , and I had n't known the first thing about my own son , and I wondered if anyone really knew anything about anything , or if we were all just making it up , blind people walking through the world with our arms outstretched , guessing . <p> I slept hard , but not well . I dreamed burglars were coming-I even heard them open the sliding glass door to the living room . They took everything-the TV , my computer , the furniture , my great-grandpa 's revolver from when he was security on the Union Pacific Railroad . They took all the silverware , even though it was just stuff I 'd picked up at Target . They took all the framed family photos Louise had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but I stayed put in my bed , huddled , pretending to be asleep , not coming out until I was sure they 'd left . When I did , I found they had n't closed the door . Snow-it was snowing in my dream-drifted in and filled half the living room , sparkling and fine like sifted sugar , and I had to shovel it out . <p> I awoke conscious that it really was cold in the house , and I pulled on some sweats and slippers . In the living room , the door was open , although just a crack , and there was no snow . I pushed it shut , shivering , went to the thermostat , and cranked up the heat . Only then did it occur to me how quiet everything was . Just the sound of the furnace cranking on and warmed air breathing up out of the vents . <p> I did n't need to check his room . I put on jeans and boots and a parka and hat and gloves , got a flashlight , and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little worn path that leads there , and at the end of it I nearly stumbled over a pair of high-top sneakers . Playing the light out onto the ice , I saw a shape about forty yards upriver , where Clay appeared to be lying flat on his back . <p> I tested the ice with one foot before stepping onto it , even though it was frozen hard enough to support an eighteen-wheeler . Then I walked out to him . He 'd put on the skates again , apparently outside , which seemed miraculous , given how cold it was . <p> Yet somehow he 'd gotten them laced and tied . He was bare-chested-his shirt and undershirt lay on the ice a few feet away , and his rib cage stood out prominently , descending fast to an almost nonexistent stomach that ended where his too-large khakis began .

His eyes were closed as if he were asleep , and an unlit cigarette jutted up casually from between his lips . The ice nearby was all marked up from where he 'd wobbled around on those things , those skates of my son 's . <p> I went inside to call Louise , late as it was . <p> Author Affiliation
