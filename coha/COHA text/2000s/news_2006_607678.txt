<p> When Deane Beman , former commissioner of golf , acquired the land for the Tournament Players Club at Avenel , he said , " This is the greatest parcel of land left on the East Coast to build a world-class golf course . " A Washingtonian , Beman touted the chance to create a course that might someday rival its neighbor , Congressional . He played down the fancy political and real estate footwork that allowed the PGA Tour to buy the entire property for $1 . Beman talked aesthetics while his Tour counted the cash . <p> Before any earth was moved , architectural consultant Ed Sneed drove around the property in a cart explaining how Avenel would be his homage to Augusta National and the design ideas of Bobby Jones . There 'd be natural amphitheaters on every hole : a spectator 's paradise . The sixth hole at Avenel would be a mirror image of the 13th hole at the Masters . What a sylvan idyll . <p> After Avenel opened , I asked Tom Kite to evaluate what had been done with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the dreams of creating a course that would be a poor man 's Tour-stop version of the Masters . <p> " It 's not a bad course , " he said , " except for the 10,000 trees they cut down that never should have been touched . " <p> So , before any pro ever hit a golf shot at Avenel , the Tour 's deeds shouted far louder than its words . Why not strip-mine a virgin forest ? After all , bulldozers are cheap . And the folks who live in the development around the course get a better view . <p> For the last 20 years , the Tour has proved it would always suck the last buck out of the enthusiastic Washington golf public rather than put one extra cent back into the Avenel complex . Every time fans endured quagmire parking lots , or were stuck in traffic for hours , the Tour promised remedies . But it never did anything  --  except pray it would never rain again in Washington in June . <p> As long as we shelled out big dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lickliter II , that 's exactly what we got the next year , too . No matter how many pros said Avenel was a tricked-up dog track , not fit for their games , with bumpy greens that ruined their putting strokes , the Tour did little except trim the grass . And sell another 100,000 tickets the next year . <p> The PGA Tour may be technically " nonprofit " in its financial structure , because it has a charity component , but its true purpose is to maximize the income of its members  --  the pro tour players . When the Tour first came to Washington in 1980 , the 125th man on the money list made $20,000 . By last year , the 125th man made $627,000 . Not bad for charity work . <p> So we should have suspected  --  long ago  --  that the callow , ungrateful PGA Tour would betray the trust of Washington 's legion of ultra-loyal golf fans one last spectacular time . But Commissioner Tim Finchem truly outdid himself . <p> As recently as last week , sponsors of the Booz Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tour . If pro golf would invest $25 million in its substandard Avenel factory , then Booz Allen would make a six-year commitment ( with a value of more than $40 million in purses and ad time ) to remain the sponsor of the Washington event through 2013 . <p> Then , on Friday , the Tour dropped a bomb out of the blue on Washington golf . Finchem , who worked here for years and knows every detail of this city 's quarter-century contributions to golf , notified Booz Allen Hamilton that , starting in ' 07 , the Avenel event would be held after the Tour Championship that is played in late September . <p> In other words , pro golf would henceforth come to Washington around the start of October , not around the start of June . <p> This is like saying your major league baseball event is being moving from July to November . Or your NFL game will be switched from December to March . For even the most ardent fans , much less players themselves , the golf season ends with the fat-purse Tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like moving a snowball fight to hell . <p> Can you say " out of season " ? Or " Who 'll be left to play in it ? " Or " Who will pay to watch it ? " <p> Golf in October is minor league fare anywhere . But it 's double dead in D.C. If you think Avenel 's greens are as pockmarked as a parking lot in June , wait until you see ' em in October . If the Booz Allen had been held here last October when most local courses were blighted , burned-up dirt tracks , we might have seen the first PGA event with 18 temporary greens . <p> This is what Washington gets for supporting the PGA Tour for the last 26 years  --  with about 2 million tickets sold , often at rip-off prices in comparison to the weak quality of the fields . This is what Washingtonians get for giving far more than a million hours of volunteer work to the Tour . In a typical summer , 1,500 golf lovers give 50,000 free hours to make the Tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting the Presidents Cup in its infancy when nobody else wanted it very much . Now the event borders on being world-class . Do n't bother to thank us local fans , volunteers or RTJ Golf Club . <p> Booz Allen officials , who did n't know the Finchem cigar would blow up until they lit it , now use the euphemism " disappointed " to describe their plight . With a little more time , however , they 'll get the real message . Booz Allen Hamilton has been told , in effect , " Take October and cross your fingers that it works or we 'll find another sucker . . . er . . . sponsor . " <p> " I was not happy about being surprised , " understated Ralph Shrader , the chairman of Booz Allen Hamilton . At least , after a few days , he has removed most of the Acme explosives powder from his face and no longer looks like Wile E. Coyote . <p> In the end , Finchem had to make a tough business call . Jack Nicklaus always wants a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping a few bucks into the Tour with a gimmick called the FedEx Cup competition . In return , FedEx wants the tournament it sponsors in Memphis to get the date that Washington has usually held . So , the Tour picked Graceland over the nation 's capital . Smart , real smart . If the Tour had a brain , FedEx would n't have a box small enough to ship it . <p> " What happened last Friday is all about the money , " said one of the key Washington golf figures who has supported the Avenel event throughout the years . " What astounds me is that the Tour does n't understand how important Washington is to golf . A lot of decisions get made in this government that could impact a business that depends on a nonprofit structure . " <p> Golf believes it 's all grown up now and can act as imperious as baseball . Who needs a market with more than 5 million people ? Golf thinks it can disrespect the same people who helped it climb the ladder to its success . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets too old to carry the sport on his back . <p> In that instant , golf will meet the same people on the way back down to " minor sport " that it spurned on the way up . Then the PGA Tour will wish it had an entrenched June date here , rather than a tacky fling with FedEx in Memphis . <p> But , by then , Washington may tell the Tour what the Tour just told Washington : Drop dead .
