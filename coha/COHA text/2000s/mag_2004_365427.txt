Chief executives of U.S. companies that sent the most service jobs overseas last year saw the greatest boost to their own paychecks , according to a study released last week by think tanks Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair Economy . Those CEOs got an average 46% raise , to $10.4 million , while CEO compensation at a broader swath of companies averaged a 9% jump , to $8.1 million , suggesting that CEOs personally benefit when companies hire cheaper workers abroad . " It 's a flashy finding , " says Paul Oyer , associate professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business . " But these are two separate issues , and there 's no reason to think they 're related . " In fact , a 1998 study by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign economist Kevin Hallock , published in the American Economic Review , found no causal relationship between layoffs and CEO pay increases , even though the two often happen together .  --  By Barbara Kiviat             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
