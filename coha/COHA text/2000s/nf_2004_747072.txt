Section : Features : Argentina Neighborhood assemblies and factory takeovers in Argentina <p> In December 19-20 , 2001 , the Argentine public unleashed a new form of civic expression and unexpectedly discovered its potential to effect political change . During this historic 48-hour period , thousands of people spontaneously took to the streets to protest their country 's disastrous economic state and forced then-President Fernando de la Ra to resign . <p> The display of outrage was the climax of a tense situation that had been building for many years . By early December 2001 , Argentina was struggling with severe unemployment , record-breaking levels of poverty , and a government and economic system in ruins . After more than 10 years of what had appeared to be economic stability , Argentina defaulted on more than $140 billion in loans from the international lending community , including the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank and private investors from all over the world . This massive default caused Argentina 's economy to crash and prompted the banks to put an immediate freeze on accounts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period prior to the crash , Argentina enjoyed highly amicable relations with the same lenders . In fact , throughout the decade of the 1990s , many individuals and institutions in the international economic community viewed Argentina as a model of neoliberal economic development , a prototype frequently recommended to underdeveloped nations by the IMF/World Bank . <p> The centerpiece of Argentina 's " success story " was Finance Minster Domingo Cavallo 's controversial convertibility program , instituted in 1991 to calm hyperinflation . International economists lauded Cavallo 's response to Argentina 's economic insecurity , calling convertibility , which pegged the Argentine peso to the US dollar and made these currencies interchangeable in Argentina , a " revolutionary " solution for developing countries . When the crisis exploded , the program 's fundamental flaws were revealed . <p> The Argentine people took to the streets not only to protest De la Ra 's failure to live up to his campaign promises to eliminate corruption in government and reactivate the sluggish economy , but also to express their anger at having been led down a treacherous path for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . A remarkable number of social , political and cultural movements were born out of the extraordinary evenings of December 19 and 20 , 2001 . Among the most exciting are the neighborhood assemblies and worker-led factory recuperations . Local Organizing <p> Neighborhood assemblies were formed when groups of people , many of whom had lived next door to each other for years as strangers , gathered in central locations in their neighborhoods on the first unforgettable night of protest . Pulled out of their homes by the necessity to do something in the midst of the economic and political crisis that was destroying Argentina 's cultural and social fabric , neighbors began to share and discuss common problems , debate ideas and listen to each other as they met for the first time in plazas , parks and on street corners . This randomly assembled melange of individuals - women , men and children of all ages , backgrounds and experiences - soon realized that together , as an organized whole , they formed a powerful force that could work to reclaim the centrality of the pueblo argentino in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neighborhood assemblies , concentrated mostly in the capital city , were formed with a commitment to gender equality and horizontality . Without formal leadership positions or designated roles , they have been able to function with surprising efficiency and equity . Since the December 2001 explosion of activism , many people who had never been involved in social or political movements , particularly middle-class women , have been finding their political voice . <p> Initially , neighborhood assemblies held their meetings at the same outdoor locations where they gathered originally . After several months of braving harsh weather and contending with the noise and commotion of the city streets , many began taking over abandoned buildings and converting them into public meeting places . The Asamblea del Cid Campeador , a large , active assembly in a middleclass residential neighborhood in Buenos Aires , is one example of this trend . In July 2002 , the group " recuperated " a deserted bank building . Since then , the space has become a thriving community center where neighbors come to participate in free daily workshops in yoga , tango @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political events , including debates , panels and street festivals . Serving as an essential outlet for both incipient and veteran activists , the neighborhood assemblies provide a welcoming space for free expression and political action . <p> This widespread surge in involvement is particularly striking given Argentina 's history of violence against political activists . The period from 1976-1983 , when Argentina was ruled by a brutal military junta that kidnapped , tortured and " disappeared " approximately 30,000 " subversive " citizens , including students , factory workers , union leaders and clergymen , inflicted permanent damage on the psyche of the Argentine people . During this time , citizens were instructed to keep quiet , toe the line and mind their own business , and they sought refuge in the supposed safety of their own homes . Even after democracy was restored in Argentina in 1983 , the legacy of the military 's scare tactics remained , and broad-based political activism was kept to a minimum until late 2001 . <p> The neighborhood assemblies were immediately integrated into a larger , growing political movement made up primarily of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ' groups known as piqueteros for their tactic of forming human roadblocks ( piquetes ) . While each group maintains an individual focus , they often come together at marches and rallies or to celebrate significant events related to their shared goals : establishing a central role for citizens in the overhaul of Argentina 's failing political system and destructive neoliberal economic policies , promoting more direct democracy at all levels of government , and expanding the efforts of autonomous citizen groups that work toward the creation of alternative solutions outside of government . On December 19 , 2002 , to commemorate the first anniversary of the civil uprising , these groups organized thousands of people in an " urban picket " outside of the Central Bank and Stock Exchange in downtown Buenos Aires . Neighborhood cacerolazos ( banging pots and pans in the streets in protest ) followed in the evening . On the next day , more than 40,000 people , including members of human rights organizations , student groups , political parties and neighborhood assemblies , filled the Plaza de Mayo once again . There they held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by police violence during the original mobilization and to celebrate the force of their unprecedented movement . <p> In the weeks and months leading up to Argentina 's highly contested presidential elections , held on April 27 , 2003 after more than 15 months under the leadership of interim President Eduardo Duhalde , neighborhood assemblies ran their own campaigns to raise awareness of the various voting options and to encourage people to get involved in shaping their country 's future beyond casting an obligatory vote at the ballot box . <p> Although many assemblies initially opposed all of the candidates running , the eventual winner , Nestor Kirchner , has surprised people with his willingness to listen to their demands and work collaboratively with different activist groups to transform their country . With Kirchner now settled in the Casa Rosada , Argentina 's presidential mansion , the neighborhood assemblies continue their community-based organizing and are increasing pressure on the new government to enact rapid changes . <p> Across the country , in the months since the political turmoil abated , both the number and size of the assemblies have significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooptation of these supposedly nonpartisan spaces by left-wing political parties . Some observers take the lower visibility and smaller numbers as signs of a weakened movement and predict that the assemblies will not be around much longer . Those that remain , however , have demonstrated a remarkable commitment to their fight and hold firmly to their belief that by working for change over time they will achieve their goals for a renewed Argentina . Recuperating Work Spaces <p> The neighborhood assembly movement is just one of many unique forms of activism that has sprung up during this dynamic and complicated moment in Argentine history . Years before the neighborhood assemblies developed , the first seeds of a large-scale movement for change were already being planted in factories across the country . When severe economic recession put thousands of factory jobs in jeopardy , workers across Argentina decided they could no longer sit back and watch their livelihood slip away . Rather than stand by passively as factories closed , the machinery was auctioned off and thousands of people were let go without receiving the months of back pay they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decided to " recuperate " the shops where they had been employed . This consisted of small groups of committed workers occupying factories and restarting production using leftover machinery and materials , paying out of pocket to purchase whatever else they needed . <p> One of the trailblazers in this growing movement was IMPA , a metallurgical factory in Buenos Aires that was recuperated and converted into a workers ' cooperative in 1998 . Zanon , a ceramics factory in the southern region of Patagonia , and Chilavert , a printing press in the province of Buenos Aires , are just a few of the more than 160 factories that have followed suit , in the process preserving more than 10,000 jobs . Each factory has a different story , a unique internal culture , and a particular management style that the workers developed together . In many cases , the employees formed cooperatives and eliminated hierarchical management structure . Everyone earns the same base salary and all major decisions are voted on in regular assembly meetings . <p> The first series of recuperations paved the way for a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the factories ' successes , providing a network through which workers have been able to share their experiences and lessons learned , both positive and negative , throughout the course of this difficult adventure . With the support of the neighborhood assembly movement , left-wing political parties , the independent press and other community organizations , the recuperated factories have been able to defend their right to genuine work and have expanded production in Argentina 's slowly growing economy . In the case of IMPA , which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary under worker control , production has tripled and the payroll has expanded from 50 to 172 workers after a difficult and uncertain beginning . Rebuilding Social Cohesion <p> Under the leadership of President Kirchner , a formerly unknown Peronist governor of the sparsely populated southern province of Santa Cruz , the future is beginning to look brighter for the assemblies , the factories and the nation . In his first six months in office , Kirchner won public support for his efforts to address the widespread corruption afflicting many of Argentina 's government agencies and pursue an ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearances during Argentina 's " Dirty War . " As a result of his removal of corrupt Supreme Court justices , untrustworthy police and military chiefs , and his attempts to reopen trials against war criminals , Kirchner 's credibility soared . He gave audiences to individuals and organizations from across the political and socioeconomic spectrum , hearing voices that had been ignored by past administrations and recognizing the immediacy of people 's needs , particularly those of unemployed workers and the newly impoverished middle class . <p> Kirchner 's approach to improving Argentina 's dire economic situation contributed to his broad public support . Polls in fall 2003 showed his approval ratings near 80% , an unprecedented figure in a country that so recently suffered widespread public disaffection with its historically dubious political system . As a presidential candidate , Kirchner made clear his intention to improve economic conditions by bolstering domestic industry and exports , creating jobs in both the public and private sectors , and expanding regional trade relations , particularly through enhanced MERCOSUR agreements . He shunned former President Carlos Menem 's strategy of blindly following IMF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called for the government to increase austerity measures , cut back on social spending , and immediately repay its substantial foreign debts . In fact , with popular Finance Minister Roberto Lavagna by his side , Kirchner successfully negotiated an agreement with the IMF that drastically reduced the fund 's demands for compensation to banks and privately owned utilities for losses due to the peso 's devaluation . The agreement reduced primary fiscal surplus requirements and established a debt repayment schedule that would not deplete the country 's reserves . Kirchner emphasized his refusal to spend the country 's limited funds on debt repayment when the money is urgently needed to feed millions of unemployed Argentines . <p> Countless obstacles remain for Kirchner and his cabinet , who inherited a social , political and economic crisis the likes of which Argentina has never seen . Menem-friendly politicians , who maintain a powerful voice in Congress and in provinces across the country , have attacked Kirchner for demonstrating " left-leaning tendencies " and resisted his efforts to institute reforms to the old system , from which they personally profited . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery , most people have yet to see or feel the improvement , and unemployment persists . The government still needs to negotiate billions in privately held debt , and initial offers have been strongly rebuffed . Finally , in the face of continued police oppression , some of the more radical autonomous activist groups have begun to identify Kirchner as a threat to their movements , as the middle class , more satisfied with Kirchner than with past leaders , is no longer as sympathetic to their situation . <p> The winds of change are blowing in South America , with Lula in power in Brazil and Chvez holding strong in Venezuela . In Argentina , where citizens are reclaiming the public 's centrality in national decision-making , faith in government may slowly be restored . <p> Pulled out of their homes by the necessity to do something in the midst of the economic and political crisis that was destroying Argentina 's cultural and social fabric , neighbors began to share and discuss common problems , debate ideas and listen to each other as they met for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When severe economic recession put thousands of factory jobs in jeopardy , workers Argentina decided they could no longer sit watch their livelihood slip away . Rather than stand by passively as factories closed , the machinery was auctioned off and thousands of people were let go without receiving the months of back pay they were owed , workers came together in a few unprecedented cases and decided to " recuperate " the shops where they had been employed . <p> By Carolyn Sattin <p>
