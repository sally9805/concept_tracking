1 Going Out // When you met a girl from another factory , you quickly took her measure . What year are you ? you asked each other , as if speaking not of human beings but of the makes of cars . How much a month ? Including room and board ? How much for overtime ? Then you might ask what province she was from . You never asked her name . // To have a true friend inside the factory was not easy . Girls slept twelve to a room , and in the tight confines of the dorm it was better to keep your secrets . Some girls joined the factory with borrowed ID cards and never told anyone their real names . Some spoke only to those from their home provinces , but that had risks : Gossip traveled quickly from factory to village , and when you went home every auntie and granny would know how much you made and how much you saved and whether you went out with boys . // When you did make a friend , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had nowhere to stay , you shared your bunk despite the risk of a ten-yuan fine , about $1.25 , if you got caught . If she worked far away , you would get up early on a rare day off and ride hours on the bus , and at the other end your friend would take leave from work  --  this time , the fine one hundred yuan  --  to spend the day with you . You might stay at a factory you did n't like , or quit one you did , because a friend asked you to . Friends wrote letters every week , although the girls who had been out longer considered that childish . They sent messages by mobile phone instead . // Friends fell out often because life was changing so fast . The easiest thing in the world was to lose touch with someone . // The best day of the month was payday . But in a way it was the worst day , too . After you had worked hard for so long , it was infuriating to see how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes late one morning , or taking a half day off for feeling sick , or having to pay extra when the winter uniforms switched to summer ones . On payday , everyone crowded the post office to wire money to their families . Girls who had just come out from home were crazy about sending money back , but the ones who had been out longer laughed at them . Some girls set up savings accounts for themselves , especially if they already had boyfriends . Everyone knew which girls were the best savers and how many thousands they had saved . Everyone knew the worst savers , too , with their lip gloss and silver mobile phones and heart-shaped lockets and their many pairs of high-heeled shoes . // The girls talked constantly of leaving . Workers were required to stay six months , and even then permission to quit was not always granted . The factory held the first two months of every worker 's pay ; leaving without approval meant losing that money and starting all over somewhere else . That was a fact of factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a factory was easy . The hard part was getting out . // The only way to find a better job was to quit the one you had . Interviews took time away from work , and a new hire was expected to start right away . Leaving a job was also the best guarantee of getting a new one : The pressing need for a place to eat and sleep was incentive to find work fast . Girls often quit a factory in groups , finding courage in numbers and pledging to join a new factory together , although that usually turned out to be impossible . The easiest thing in the world was to lose touch with someone . // * * * // For a long time Lu Qingmin was alone . Her older sister worked at a factory in Shenzhen , a booming industrial city an hour away by bus . Her friends from home were scattered at factories up and down China 's coast , but Min , as her friends called her , was not in touch with them . It was a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was working , she did n't tell anyone where she was . She simply dropped out of sight . // Her factory 's name was Carrin Electronics . The Hong Kong-owned company made alarm clocks , calculators , and electronic calendars that displayed the time of day in cities around the world . The factory had looked respectable when Min came for an interview in March 2003 : tile buildings , a cement yard , a metal accordion gate that folded shut . It was n't until she was hired that she was allowed inside . Workers slept twelve to a room in bunks crowded near the toilets ; the rooms were dirty and they smelled bad . The food in the canteen was bad , too : A meal consisted of rice , one meat or vegetable dish , and soup , and the soup was watery . // A day on the assembly line stretched from eight in the morning until midnight  --  thirteen hours on the job plus two breaks for meals  --  and workers labored every day for weeks on end . Sometimes on a Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . The workers made four hundred yuan a month  --  the equivalent of fifty dollars  --  and close to double that with overtime , but the pay was often late . The factory employed a thousand people , mostly women , either teenagers just out from home or married women already past thirty . You could judge the quality of the workplace by who was missing : young women in their twenties , the elite of the factory world . When Min imagined sitting on the assembly line every day for the next ten years , she was filled with dread . She was sixteen years old . // From the moment she entered the factory she wanted to leave , but she pledged to stick it out six months . It would be good to toughen herself up , and her options were limited for now . The legal working age was eighteen , though sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds could work certain jobs for shorter hours . Generally only an employer that freely broke the labor law  --  " the very blackest factories , " Min called them  --  would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first week on the job , Min turned seventeen . She took a half day off and walked the streets alone , buying some sweets and eating them by herself . She had no idea what people did for fun . Before she had come to the city , she had only a vague notion of what a factory was ; dimly , she imagined it as a lively social gathering . " I thought it would be fun to work on the assembly line , " she said later . " I thought it would be a lot of people working together , busy , talking , and having fun . I thought it would be very free . But it was not that way at all . " // Talking on the job was forbidden and carried a five-yuan fine . Bathroom breaks were limited to ten minutes and required a sign-up list . Min worked in quality control , checking the electronic gadgets as they moved past on the assembly line to make sure buttons worked and plastic pieces joined and batteries hooked up as they should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sang with the other women on the line . Sitting still made her feel trapped , like a bird in a cage , so she frequently ran to the bathroom just to look out the window at the green mountains that reminded her of home . Dongguan was a factory city set in the lush subtropics , and sometimes it seemed that Min was the only one who noticed . Because of her , the factory passed a rule that limited workers to one bathroom break every four hours ; the penalty for violators was five yuan . // After six months Min went to her boss , a man in his twenties , and said she wanted to leave . He refused . // " Your performance on the assembly line is not good , " said Min 's boss . " Are you blind ? " // " Even if I were blind , " Min countered , " I would not work under such an ungrateful person as you . " // She walked off the line the next day in protest , an act that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her boss and asked again to leave . His response surprised her : Stay through the lunar new year holiday , which was six months away , and she could quit with the two months ' back pay that the factory owed her . Min 's boss was gambling that she would stay . Workers flood factory towns like Dongguan after the new year , and competition for jobs then is the toughest . // After the fight , Min 's boss became nicer to her . He urged her several times to consider staying ; there was even talk of a promotion to factory-floor clerk , though it would not bring an increase in pay . Min resisted . " Your factory is not worth wasting my whole youth here , " she told her boss . She signed up for a computer class at a nearby commercial school . When there was n't an overtime shift , she skipped dinner and took a few hours of lessons in how to type on a keyboard or fill out forms by computer . Most of the factory girls believed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , but Min was different . " Learning is better than not learning , " she reasoned . // She phoned home and said she was thinking of quitting her job . Her parents , who farmed a small plot of land and had three younger children still in school , advised against it . " You always want to jump from this place to that place , " her father said . Girls should not be so flighty . Stay in one place and save some money , he told her . // Min suspected this was not the best advice . " Do n't worry about me , " she told her father . " I can take care of myself . " // She had two true friends in the factory now , Liang Rong and Huang Jiao'e , who were both a year older than Min . They washed Min 's clothes for her on the nights she went to class . Laundry was a constant chore because the workers had only a few changes of clothes . In the humid dark nights after the workday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dormitory bathrooms carrying buckets of water . // Once you had friends , life in the factory could be fun . On rare evenings off , the three girls would skip dinner and go roller-skating , then return to watch a late movie at the factory . As autumn turned into winter , the cold in the unheated dorms kept the girls awake at night . Min dragged her friends into the yard to play badminton until they were warm enough to fall asleep . // The 2004 lunar new year fell in late January . Workers got only four days off , not enough time to go home and come out again . Min holed up in her dorm and phoned home four times in two days . After the holiday she went to her boss again , and this time he let her leave . Liang Rong and Huang Jiao'e cried when Min told them her news . In a city of strangers , they were the only ones who knew about her departure . They begged her to stay ; they believed that conditions at other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay would be the same in the end . Min did not think so . // She promised she would return for a visit after she got paid at her new job . Min left that same day with a few clothes in a backpack and the two months ' wages that the factory owed her . She did not take her towels and bedding with her ; those things had cost money , but she could n't bear the sight of them anymore . // In ten months on the assembly line , Min had sent home three thousand yuan  --  about $360  --  and made two true friends . // She should have been scared . But all she knew was that she was free . // * * * // In the village where Lu Qingmin was born , almost everyone shared her family name . Ninety households lived there , planting rice , rape , and cotton on small plots of land . Min 's family farmed half an acre and ate most of what they grew . // Her future appeared set when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rural life : A family must have a son . Min 's parents had four girls before finally giving birth to a boy ; in those early years of the government policy limiting families to one child , enforcement was lax in much of the countryside . But five children would bring heavy financial burdens as the economy opened up in the 1980s and the cost of living rose . As the second-oldest child , Min would bear many of those burdens . // She disliked school and did poorly . As long as she could remember , she was in trouble . She climbed the neighbors ' trees to steal their plums ; if she was caught she got a beating . Once when her mother ordered her to do chores , Min refused . " There are so many people at home . Why do I have to do it ? " Her mother chased her for a quarter mile and hit her with a stick . // She was good at having fun . She learned how to swim and to drive a truck ; she loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have fallen every way there is to fall , " Min said . " But you ca n't think about that . " She was her father 's favorite . One summer , he rented a truck and she traveled the countryside with him , selling watermelons from their farm . They drove during the day and slept in the truck at night ; it became one of Min 's fondest memories . Most migrants associated the place they came from with poverty and backwardness , and some were even reluctant to say the name of their village . But long after Min came to the city , she still talked about her hometown as if it were something beautiful . // In the late 1990s , both of Min 's parents went out to work to earn money for their children 's schooling . Her father worked in a shoe factory on the coast , but poor health drove him back . Later her mother went out for a year . Min boarded at a middle school in a nearby town but returned home every weekend to cook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Almost all the young people in her village had gone out . When Min was still in middle school , her older sister , Guimin , went to work in a factory in Dongguan . Soon after , Min failed the national high school entrance exam and her parents considered having her go out , too . Guimin phoned home and urged them to keep Min in school ; Guimin 's factory wages , she said , would help cover the tuition . Their parents agreed , and Min enrolled in a two-year vocational high school . That made her one of the most educated people in the village  --  more educated than Guimin , who had sacrificed her own schooling to help the family . // Guimin came home for the 2003 lunar new year holiday and took Min away with her when she left . Min had one more semester of school , but she wanted to save the tuition and get a jump on the job hunt . She was thrilled to be leaving home ; she had never ridden on a train or seen a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things , and see the world , " she said . // In Dongguan , Guimin rented a cheap hotel room for Min and found her a job in a Japanese factory that made liquid crystal displays . Min worked there for a month and left . She had never been in a place where she did n't know anyone , and she was so lonely she could n't bear it . She returned to the hotel and found a job at another factory but did n't take it . Her sister offered to continue paying for the hotel room , but Min felt herself becoming a burden . At a bus station , she spotted a help-wanted flyer for a quality-control job on the assembly line of an electronics factory . She dialed the number on the ad  --  many were just scams to trick migrants out of their money  --  and the person who answered the phone gave Min directions to the factory . It was a three-hour bus ride to the southeast tip of Dongguan and Carrin Electronics , the place where Min spent her hard year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Min realized the place was worse than the Japanese factory she had just left behind . But it was too late to turn back , and she did not want to ask her sister 's help again . She was getting used to being on her own  --  it was better that way . //
