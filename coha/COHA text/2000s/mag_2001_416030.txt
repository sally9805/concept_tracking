" ... I BEGAN MY CAREER BEFORE I WAS AWARE OF MAGAZINES AND THE POWER THOSE IMAGES HAVE ON YOUNG WOMEN ... " Photograph // The life of a supermodel often conjures images of diva designers , bacchanalian parties and jet-set extravagance . This stereotype makes models a symbol of excess , the poster children of hedonism . But when we look at the human behind the caricature , the question arises : How does a person caught up in the swirl of celebrity , money and parties at a young age manage to keep a sense of balance ? The question is even more pressing when you consider that the industry is littered with people who were n't able to survive the onslaught . Even while she was an unwilling symbol of over-thetop glamour , Christy Turlington was an anomaly in the fashion world , a polite professional who avoided arrogance and attitude . " Christy 's uniqueness is a combination of maintaining personal dignity and a very firm grip on manners , " explains Kurt Markus , a photographer who has worked with Turlington for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She reaches down to a resource that comes from her family and early years . She is a rock . " Education and charity have been important aspects of Turlington 's life . After spending 10 years in the spotlight of the beauty culture , she chose the anonymity of life as a student at New York University . She enjoyed studying literature and religion and graduated cum laude with a degree in philosophy . Turlington has responded to the wealth her beauty has given her by working tirelessly for charities that support children ( Art Inspiring Hope ) , education ( Intercambios Culturales of El Salvador ) , animal rights ( PETA ) and several anti-tobacco campaigns . Most important , she has had to face tobacco addiction , illness and death . When she quit smoking and subsequently gained 10 pounds-and the reproach of the industry-her response was insightful . " It led me to rethink my career . I would rather be 10 pounds heavier , tobacco-free and happy , " she said . Later , after her father died of lung cancer and she was diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local and national anti-smoking campaigns . " She did several commercials for us , " says Susan Islam of the American Cancer Society . " She was doing it because she lost her father , and that made a real difference . I think it has more impact when a celebrity devotes that much time because they have a personal interest . " Turlington finds much of her strength in yoga , meditation and Ayurveda , an ancient holistic science from India . Many of the Ayurvedic principles are based on discovering your balance as an individual . The philosophy holds that every person is a hybrid of the three elements called doshas ( vatta , pitta and kappa ) . Understanding your unique combination can help you choose how to exercise and what to eat . Finding the flexibility and balance that is required for good mental health is a challenge we all face . Psychology Today recently interviewed Turlington about how she has maintained her equilibrium in a life of extremes . How have you dealt with loss in your life ? Yoga has helped me to see death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been my experience so far . Yoga has been the best tool for managing stress and life 's challenges . Everything from my studies to my father 's death was eased by my practice of it . How long have you been practicing yoga and how did you start ? I went to my first yoga class at 18 . A friend was doing it , and I admired the discipline and focus . I decided I wanted that positive focus in my life to help me cope with the erratic lifestyle my career perpetuates . It was , and remains , an invaluable source of energy and inspiration for me , and all of my efforts in life , both personal and professional . How have you adjusted your life according to Flyurveda ? It has been an organic evolution . Through my practice of yoga I was drawn to Ayurveda , a sister philosophy , and also to things that are generally better for me . My diet , and also the way that I respond to the world and the world to me , has gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reflect who you are ? I am a vata/pitta , which means that my constitution is generally pitta , hard-working , a leader , but I also have a vata imbalance , which is revealed in my skin type . I have dry skin and a small bone structure , a lot of creative energy and I speak very quickly . This is just a snapshot of how dosha qualities affect me physically , but Ayurveda is a very complex science that is 5,000 years old . We all have all three doshas and all five elements of nature in each of us in varying degrees , which makes each of us an individual . You left the catwalk in 1994 and returned to school in 1997 . Did you feet you were tired of the beauty culture ? I have n't left modeling completely ; I just took a step out , and I now have the rare luxury of picking and choosing how to spend my days . I wanted to explore so many other interests that I had and still do have , and that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to school but never expected it would be so hard or take so long . At 26 , I knew I was ready and that the transition would only become harder , so I just did it . It was the best thing I ever did , apart from quitting smoking , and it gave me so much self-knowledge . It allowed me to see that I could do whatever I wanted to do going forward . Studying philosophy and religion seems miles away from the modeling routine-was it something you wanted to do for a while ? How did your studies shape your perspective on what you wanted to do when you graduated ? Everything I read in school , from Nietzche to Hannah Arendt and Victor Frankel , helped shape the way I see the world , but I was particularly drawn to religious , mystical , spiritual texts and scripture , which reiterated the essentials of life that I hold valuable . My study of religion , philosophy and art , plus my practice of yoga and my career as a model , all brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have learned and applied it to my businesses , Sundari and Nuala . How is your clothing specifically designed for yoga ? Nuala was designed for the lifestyle of yoga , not just the practice of postures that most people associate with yoga , but the clothing had to withstand a vigorous practice as well . It was important for me to make clothes that transcended the boundaries of the workplace and working out , the external and internal experiences , travel and home life . Why do these activities need to be contradictory ? I designed the collection for my lifestyle , and I have found that many women were also searching for the same thing . You started a modeling career at 14 years old . How did you maintain a sense of balance and continue to develop as a person in that atmosphere ? I only modeled after school until 16 and then summers until 18 when I graduated , so I always maintained a fairly normal life as a teen . Photograph // However , I was living a double life of sorts , with travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to NYC at 18 , but my mother frequently accompanied me until I was an adult . After being associated with the rise of the " supermodel , " how did it feel to move away from the spotlight and the fashion industry ? That was one of the best things I ever did . I needed more intellectual stimulation , which I found the spotlight a distraction to . Without it , I could further evolve as a person . What did you learn about women 's relationship to beauty from the time you spent in the fashion industry ? Nothing . I think each woman has her own relationship to beauty . I began to understand this after I made the decision to step outside the profession to continue my studies . Life teaches you your opinion about these matters , not modeling . It just is not real or broad enough to provide the answers to those questions . How were you able to avoid many of the difficult body-image issues that models deal with ? I guess I am fortunate in that I have maintained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career before I was aware of magazines and the power those images have on young women . And , when I was in the midst of that world and working with talented people , I simply entrusted them to worry about the way I looked . You have been active with many charities-which ones are most important to you ? There are so many important causes in the world , but I have learned that I can be most effective through my anti-tobacco work . It has been great because it has turned so many personal negatives into positives for me . I was addicted to tobacco for many years and then lost my father to lung cancer due to his addiction to the substance . Now I can share my experience and struggle and encourage others to take better care of themselves . I also continue to help a variety of other not-for-profit , grassroots organizations in areas involving children , education , the environment and animal rights , but given my time constraints and desire to focus on making the most impact , anti-tobacco remains my platform . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her family are from there , so I wanted to help when the war ended and the country was going through transitions . I continue to support cultural- and health-related organizations and earthquake relief . We are doing a story in this issue about how obsession with the culture of beauty can make healthy romantic relationships problematic . Have you ever experienced this ? I think a relationship is not healthy if too much emphasis is focused on beauty . Obsession of any kind is intrinsically unhealthy . What are some qualities you look for in an ideal partner ? Openness , kindness , compassion , adventure , humor . What do you value most in your closest relationships ? The same , but I will settle for two or three .
