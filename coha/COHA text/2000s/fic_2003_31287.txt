Chapter One : The Drowning Women around me were screaming , running , and somebody was shouting , trying to get my attention . They 'd left their clothes upon the rocks where they were beating out the yellow stains that their husbands ' sweat had left in the armpits of the shirts . Soapsuds were still on their arms . I could hear the pitter-patter of their feet on the gravel that had been washed over thousands of times by the river , or covered completely when heavy rains swelled the river and made it impossible for us women to gather there . I saw when Pam hiked her skirt above her thick , scarred knees and kicked off her broken-down sneakers , so she could run faster . The other woman , whose baby always had one hand in her mouth and the other wrapped in her mama 's skirt , violently shook the infant 's hands away . I saw Carol 's breasts swinging from side to side underneath her red T-shirt . Her dark nipples protruded because the water from washing had flattened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't hurt from flapping like that against her stomach . It was n't till I saw Pam grab the small body in the blue shirt , which had a hole in the front , that I noticed my baby was missing from under the tree where I had left him sleeping . " Mi baby , mi baby ! Oh , mi God , mi baby ! " I cried , pushing my way between the women who were pulling my boy 's body out of the water . " Timothy , Timothy . " The women , all mothers themselves and much older than I was , would n't let me near my baby 's soft body , which they had placed on the sand . Pam , although I 'm sure she 'd never done anything like this before , pressed her mouth , her chapped lips , against my baby 's pink lips and tried to force some of her air into his lungs . But his little three-year-old body did n't move , could n't move . Another woman tried to press his chest and force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im upside down and let the water out , " someone I could n't see shouted from behind . My baby , Timothy , who squealed each time I bathed him and did n't play in the water like most babies like to do , had awakened , left the shade tree where I had put him to sleep , walked to the bank of the river , and drowned in water that was scarcely high enough to wet my skirt . All river women , and not one of us knew how to save a drowning boy . They pressed his chest . They blew air into his mouth . Mattie pressed her ear against his chest and said she heard no beats . Someone prayed . Another woman cried . They looked at me as if I were the river and not the mother . They would n't let me touch him . They did n't want to accept that my baby had walked into the water when I was n't looking and drowned . The river had filled his little lungs with water and smothered the air he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pushed away the women who were holding me back . I simply wanted to hold his soft body in my arms one more time before it began to stiffen . They asked me what I saw , what I heard . They were impatient , like roosters trying to get at hens . Someone said the word " police . " I do n't know how it happened . The current was n't really strong . I had n't yet lost any sheets , nor any of Timothy 's or Grams 's clothes . The current was n't strong . " You did n't see de bwoy walking to you ? You never see him when he fall into de water ? " they asked , but I know I did n't see my boy 's head bob back up to the top of the water , or hear the gurgle deep in his throat when he tried to say " Mama " and swallowed water instead . I did n't see his arms , in the little blue T-shirt , reach out in the air and then drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I see the water push his body , facedown , into the soft gray sand on the bank of the river before pulling him out again , and then depositing him again . I did n't see the ripples in the water or the air bubbles his breath formed in the water . I did n't see him drown . While I was rocking my baby one last time , I heard another woman say she was going to the main road to flag down a car , since the one ambulance would n't come out here to pick up the body of a dead boy . I held him . His body was limp in my arms , not yet rigid but stiffening slightly . There was nothing in his face , nothing in the eyes that somebody had closed , but which I opened slightly with my fingers . The water from his clothes dripped down my arms , streaking and tickling , mingling with the soapy water on my body . I fell to the ground , the sand and the rocks hard against my legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled back as if he were just looking at my face , as if he had been looking at me and fallen asleep with my face printed on his mind . My salt water mingled with his river water . I whispered the name " Mommy Kelithe , " the way he said it , as if one name was never enough . I held his body tight , and when the car came , somebody led me to it . I remember Timothy 's body , soft and wet against my chest , and the tickling of water from my eyes rolling over my cheeks , falling gently on the wet body of my son . This is what I would have told my mother , if only she had asked .
