<p> ST . PAUL  --  Maggie Loftus thought her day could n't get any worse when IRS agents told her that her tax returns were being audited . <p> Then they told her that the paid preparer who had done her taxes was suspected of submitting dozens of false claims that boosted clients ' refunds and defrauded the government of more than $8 million . <p> For her , the bottom line was expensive : more than $5,000 in tax repayments , plus interest and penalties . <p> " I was totally shocked that a professional tax person could have done something like this to me , " says Loftus , a single mother of three and former client of the preparer based in St. Paul . " I had no idea that there was anything that was n't right . " <p> Today , as paid preparers complete more than 60% of the individual tax returns filed by Americans , questions are increasingly being raised about the reliability of those preparers , as well as about the federal government 's limited oversight of the tax-preparation field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings against alleged problem preparers found that thousands of taxpayers have been hit with repayment demands and penalties since 2001 as the IRS moved to recover millions of dollars in tax losses . The victims , some of whom offered a rare inside look at their tax woes , often include immigrants , military recruits and others unfamiliar with the tax system . <p> Many of the preparers have been accused of using improper deductions and credits to inflate the size of tax refunds in apparent efforts to attract new clients and increase profits , the court records show . Others charged a percentage of the inflated refunds as their fees . <p> Most tax preparers are reputable , and it is all but impossible to quantify how many clients have been victimized by the unscrupulous or inadequately trained . But Richard Speier , acting chief of IRS Criminal Investigation , says , " The proportion of our work in this area has increased steadily over the last five years . " <p> In a sign of the problems taxpayers may face , five of 19 tax-preparer offices selected for undercover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigative arm of Congress , produced returns that had up to nearly $2,000 in unwarranted refunds . But in two cases the returns cost taxpayers more than $1,500 in refunds . <p> An earlier GAO analysis in 2003 warned that while the number of taxpayers " poorly served " by paid preparers is probably small , even a small percentage " can translate into millions of affected taxpayers . " <p> Disaffected may be more accurate . <p> In Brandon , Fla. , Judith Moss says it cost her roughly $50,000 to repay the federal government and make up other losses after her tax preparer , Linda Borden , incorrectly told her that expenses for her home television and dining room table were tax-deductible . <p> " What she did was wrong , and she hurt me and a lot of people , " Moss says of Borden , who did Moss ' taxes from 1995 to 2003 . <p> Borden , who has since been barred from preparing federal tax returns , is scheduled for a May trial on criminal tax charges . Borden and Clarence Counts , the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment . <p> At the Marine Corps Miramar and Camp Pendleton bases in California , about 600 recruits fell victim in 2001 to preparers from Western Tax Services and other firms that boosted refunds by improperly claiming deductions for such things as barracks furniture . Six of nine preparers subsequently charged by federal authorities pleaded guilty to tax charges . <p> " They found out this was a target-rich environment : young men and women who in many cases had never had to do their taxes before , " says Maj. Jerry Stevenson , a Marine Corps lawyer who alerted the IRS and helped recruits clean up their tax mess . <p> And in St. Louis , Joe and Dorothy Reid had to repay the IRS after investigators found evidence their preparer , Charles Eden , had improperly claimed a $6,141 refund on their 2001 tax return . Eden made similar claims on other clients ' returns , court records show . <p> " We were mad at him , because what he did was n't right . It was very difficult for us , " Dorothy Reid says of Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison for his guilty plea to a tax charge . <p> Typical cases <p> Large tax-preparation chains have n't escaped the problem . In January , Ella Mae Peterson , a 20-year veteran H &R; Block preparer in St. Louis , was sentenced to 18months in prison for her guilty plea in a tax-filing case . She allegedly cost the federal government more than $6.5 million by preparing returns with false business deductions and other fictitious entries , court records show . <p> Peterson was also ordered to pay more than $840,000 to H &R; Block and several individuals to cover losses from fraudulent returns . <p> The cases are typical of the more than 500 indictments and injunctions that the IRS and the U.S. Justice Department have filed against tax preparers and tax-plan promoters since 2001 . <p> The cases often involve preparers who have cost the government millions of dollars in tax losses . For instance , Borden allegedly promoted a tax scheme in 22 states that defrauded the IRS of more than $15million , according to Justice . <p> Alternately , some preparers overlook or neglect to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxpayers can be victimized at either end of the scale , " says Kevin Brown , who heads the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division . <p> The 2003 GAO report estimated that 12% of taxpayers who had used paid preparers had little or no confidence that they had not overpaid Uncle Sam . <p> " The average taxpayer needs to know that the person they 're going to has some minimum level of competency , " says National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson , whose IRS office helps taxpayers resolve problems with the agency . <p> Competence and reliability <p> But competence and reliability can be hard for taxpayers to determine , in part because of limited government oversight . <p> As recently as 1990 , most federal tax preparers were certified public accountants , attorneys or so-called enrolled agents , trained in tax law and authorized to practice before the IRS . Most of those professionals are licensed by the federal government or the states . In some cases , they are required to take regular tax-education courses . <p> However , an IRS-promoted push to expand electronic tax filing has indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparers who operate from homes , storefronts or other businesses . As of 2003 , as many as 600,000 unenrolled preparers were at work nationwide , according to an estimate by Olson 's office . <p> Unlike attorneys or CPAs , unenrolled preparers typically are neither licensed nor regulated . And the IRS rarely checks their work . <p> Moreover , some unenrolled preparers have limited expertise and offer tax preparation solely as a sideline to attract clients for other services , such as car or furniture sales or even check cashing . <p> " Most people would be astounded to find that while their barber or manicurist is licensed , their preparer may not be , " Francis Degen of the National Association of Enrolled Agents , a group of licensed tax professionals , told the Senate Finance Committee last week . <p> Federal investigators since 2001 have increased civil and criminal investigations and cases against suspected problem preparers . But , faced with limited resources and multiple priorities , the IRS generally focuses on the most serious cases , Speier and Brown said . <p> Although at least six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taxpayers too often face a " buyer beware " standard . <p> Since 2002 , she has pushed for IRS rules that would require unenrolled preparers to register , take competency tests and attend regular tax-education classes . <p> Several accounting and other tax industry groups , including the National Association of Tax Professionals , say they would support some form of regulation . A pending congressional measure introduced by Sen. Jeff Bingaman , D-N.M. , and co-sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats would require new federal oversight . <p> But the IRS has greeted Olson 's proposal with the same wariness Maggie Loftus showed when the investigators knocked on her door . Asked to explain , the agency cited an April 3 interview in which IRS Commissioner Mark Everson told Gannett News Service : " I 'm reluctant at this point to take on the regulation of tax preparers more directly given the multitude of challenges we face . " <p> ' Taxpayers are being harmed ' <p> Olson , however , says she crafted her plan to avoid any increased costs for the IRS . She notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees on tax preparers . <p> " I 'm baffled why this is not being done . I believe taxpayers are being harmed , " Olson says . <p> Loftus counts herself among the victims . The 40-year-old office manager and her then-husband had their 2001 and 2002 tax returns done by Nash Sonibare , 46 . He is an unenrolled preparer and Nigerian immigrant who is the subject of civil and criminal tax investigations . <p> Sonibare allegedly told clients he was a certified public accountant . <p> He is n't , the records show . <p> Sonibare prepared a 2001 tax return that court records show claimed a $1,500 education credit for the couple . Loftus says neither attended college at the time . <p> The tax returns prepared by Sonibare claimed a $4,250 loss from a home business in 2001 and a $5,416 loss for a molding business in 2002 . Loftus says her ex-husband did n't own a business . <p> Loftus , who describes herself as unfamiliar with federal tax regulations , said she signed the returns without checking them closely . Although she recalls asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court records show totaled more than $5,200 for the two years , " It seemed like he knew what he was doing . " <p> " I was totally shocked when I saw the papers when the IRS contacted me , " says Loftus . " I do n't know where all that information came from . " <p> Based on that contention , Loftus is trying to convince the IRS she was an innocent spouse who should be allowed to refile accurate tax returns . But she 's had to make repayments while her claim is considered . So far , says Loftus , she 's repaid nearly half of the more than $5,000 owed , even as she supports three children by herself . <p> Loftus is n't the only former client who blames tax troubles on Sonibare , who began working as a preparer in 1995 . Many are African immigrants who speak limited English and have " little knowledge of the complexities of the Internal Revenue Code , " a court record shows . <p> So far , federal investigators have completed audits of 88 tax returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax years . " All resulted in additional tax due , " an average of roughly $2,652 per return , according to a court declaration by IRS agent Nona Bosshart . <p> In March , U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank issued a temporary restraining order barring Sonibare from preparing tax returns . After investigators presented evidence that he ignored the order , the judge authorized marshals to change the locks to Sonibare 's office . <p> In a court affidavit , Sonibare attorney James Snyder stressed that each client who signed the tax returns completed by the preparer had , in the eyes of the IRS , taken an oath that the information on the forms was " true and correct , and complete . " <p> Sonibare and Snyder did not return calls seeking comment . However , a court record shows Sonibare told IRS agents in 2003 he never prepared false tax returns and said : " This is America , you 've got to do everything by the law . " <p> Loftus said the tax mess has taught her a lesson she said should be heeded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely at who 's doing your taxes . " <p> " I 'm always really worried about tax time now , " she says . " I 'm always afraid the government is going to come after me .
