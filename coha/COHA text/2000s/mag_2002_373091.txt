A matched set of articles published online by the British science journal Nature last week seemed calculated to provide succor to both sides in the simmering stem-cell debate . In one study , University of Minnesota researchers isolated bone-marrow cells from adult mice , grew them in dishes and injected them into mouse embryos , where they developed into nerve , liver and other types of cells . In the other study , scientists from the National Institutes of Health did similar work with stem cells from mouse embryos , which developed into brain cells that produce dopamine and could be used to treat Parkinson 's disease . <P> Proponents of human therapeutic cloning hailed the NIH study as proof that scientists need to work with stem cells taken from embryos . Foes cited the Minnesota work as proof that the same results can be achieved without embryos . <P> Nature says it was n't trying to influence the stem-cell debate and that it often pairs related articles . ( These two will be printed in the July 4 issue . ) The editors also insist that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Senate is stalled on two competing cloning bills  --  was simply to avoid being scooped by its rival , Science . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Kluger
