His Spider-Man mask may be off , but Seabiscuit star TOBEY MAGUIRE is still poised to spend the summer in the winner 's circle // IN THE WORLD-UNTO-ITSELF otherwise known as Hollywood , Tobey Maguire is unavoidable . He 's the topic of conversation during drinks at the Four Seasons ( " Can you believe that he fired his longtime agent ? " shudders a rival talent rep ) . He 's on everyone 's lips over dinner at a chichi restaurant in Beverly Hills ( " I hear Sony is n't giving him his $17 million for Spider-Man 2 until he 's done filming , " whispers one studio executive . " He 's getting scale until the last day . And anything over budget is on his head " ) . Even a non-drinking , non-eating health nut has something to say about him ( " He 's no vegan , he just pretends to be " ) . If you 're focusing on the details of the chatter about Maguire , you 're missing the point . It 's not what people are saying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying it . After all , this is a place so small that switching zip codes merits a farewell party , and Maguire has made a far more dramatic move . In the summer of 2002 , he migrated from critics ' darling in such movies as The Cider House Rules , Wonder Boys , and The Ice Storm to gargantuan movie star , thanks to a little blockbuster called Spider-Man . This summer , Maguire has traded in his slinky superhero suit for a set of racing silks to star as real-life jockey Red Pollard in the Gary Ross-directed Seabiscuit . Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand 's best-selling book about the thoroughbred champion , the $86 million movie , opening July 25 , is clearly designed more for Oscar voters than popcorn munchers . But in a season filled with second-rate sequels and oversize comic-book heroes , Universal 's Depression-era drama could end up being that rarest of pleasures : a serious summer flick that rakes it in at the box office . Which would make Maguire , once again , the summer superhero . OF COURSE YOU WANT THE DETAILS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which for the most part are , sorry to say , false . Maguire is getting paid ( to the tune of $12 million for Seabiscuit and $17 million for the Spider-Man sequel ) . And he 's a vegetarian , not a vegan-as evidenced by the dairy-filled latte accompanying the late lunch he 's scarfing down at his Beverly Hills production office . " Would you like a corn dog ? " the 28-year-old actor asks politely , offering up a tofu puppy . " You might want to try one . They 're very tasty . " Okay , so it 's a glutinous take on the real thing , but it 's good to see Maguire eating . Despite intense bulking up for Spider-Man 2 , which he 's currently filming , and intense portioning down for Seabiscuit ( for which he shed about 20 pounds ) , Maguire has yet to break out of his amorphous adolescent build . Seated behind a giant desk in a looming black leather chair , the 5-foot-8-inch actor looks like he 's hanging out on a set from Big . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he 's conducting an interview while scuba diving . The grand effect is that this yoga-practicing , teetotaling , meat-eschewing actor is ... kind of a dork . Make that a dork with serious acting chops . Ross , who directed Maguire in 1998 's Pleasantville , compares him to Hoffman and Pacino . He wrote the part of Seabiscuit 's troubled jockey Pollard specifically for Maguire . " It was flattering to think that he was writing with me in mind , " says the actor . " Gary knows me well , and I think he wrote it to my strengths . " Which would be ? " Well , you know , being ... resilient , a tough survivor , having his guard up a bit but being capable of being open as well . " Ross concurs : " He embodies all the contradictions that are inherent in Red Pollard , a prizefighter who carried a worn-out copy of Shakespeare in his pocket . Tobey is a gentle soul who is unbelievably tough . " The son of two young parents who split soon after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cook ) , Maguire spent most of his childhood shuttling between relatives on the Western seaboard . He was an intensely shy child ( he would throw up on the first day at a new school ) , so his mother offered him $100 to put toward acting classes ; by the time he reached ninth grade , he had decided to skip school and act full-time . Soon there were parts in such TV shows as Blossom and the occasional TV movie , enough to enable him to modestly support himself . While his childhood had been nomadic , Maguire 's career was fiercely focused . " I think of it like Tobey was always famous , and then fame just caught up with him , " says actor and close friend Kevin Connolly , who costarred with Maguire in the shortlived 1992 Fox sitcom Great Scott ! " He 's always had a certain confidence . " His spate of directors over the years since are inclined to agree . " He 's not your prototypical action-handsomehero guy , " says John Patterson , who directed Maguire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borchardt Story . " He 's got something else going on . He 's highly intelligent and thoughtful . " Adds director Curtis Hanson , who worked with Maguire in perhaps his most lauded role , playing the troubled James Leer in 2000 's Wonder Boys : " Tobey is very serious about his work and very smart about his career path . In Pittsburgh I where Wonder Boys was filming , he was already plotting how to get the part in Spider-Man . He loved the character , knew what he could do with it and what it could do for him . If Tobey were a racehorse , his name might be Premeditated . He 's in it for the long run . " Indeed , Maguire does n't pretend to be overwhelmed by his sudden fame : " I had an idea of it , and I chose it and pretty much it 's okay . I 'm pretty impenetrable about boundaries . " He continues : " And I always have been . I saw a clip that made me laugh-I was 17 and did a TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting there saying " Well , you know , I 'm just here to do my job , and I just work hard and do the best that I can . ' I was 17 , and I sounded virtually the same as I do now . " Single-minded , yes ; unconsciously so , no . In 1995 , Maguire hit a period of intense questioning . He landed a role in the Liv Tyler movie Empire Records but abruptly left the production mid-filming . " It 's not like I quit acting , " Maguire says , eliding over the details that led to his decision ( Empire director Allan Moyle did not respond to interview requests ) . " I just told my agent I was n't interested in anything unless it was great . I just needed to figure out what was going on and ask myself what life was and why I was doing things . I needed to figure out all my priorities . " Pretty extraordinary for a kid of 19 . More extraordinary is that the philosophical questioning seems to have paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acting fold , landing parts that were all , arguably , great : 1997 's The Ice Storm and Woody Allen 's Deconstructing Harry and his first big starring role , in Pleasantville . " I would n't say I was totally freaked out , " Maguire allows of being a leading man . " But I was 21 , and I think a couple people said to me-as if it was encouraging or something-'Wow , how does it feel ? You 're carrying a $40 million movie . ' Now that kind of stuff does n't bother me at all , but that was the first time I was the lead , and I was aware of it , and I 'm working with Joan Alien and Bill Macy , so it was a bit intimidating and nerve-racking . " Adds Ross , who was making his feature directorial debut : " I think we were both a little nervous ... but Tobey 's talent has never been different . He just has a lot more control over what he 's doing now ... and his work ethic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bulletin board of his character where he wrote down the motivation of every single scene . It was so detailed that sometimes I 'd go there , look at the bulletin board , and say , " Where are we now ? ' ' " Even at this point in his career , says Maguire , " I consider myself a student . A young actor learning my craft . " IF IT 'S A HIT OF ADRENALINE YOU 'RE AFTER , HEAD NORTH from Maguire 's L.A. office to the Santa Anita racetrack , with its art deco clubhouse and its pristine course . Out front , Jeff Bridges , who plays Seabiscuit owner Charles Howard ( Academy Award winner Chris Cooper rounds out the film 's star trio ) , is rehearsing a stirring speech about his little-horse-that-could with Ross . " One third of the time you 're doing an action movie , and the rest of the time it 's an intimate character piece , " says Ross . The action-movie third is out on the track , where a pack of horses are galloping-no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt at more than 30 miles an hour . The horses complete their laps , trailed by camera trucks trying to keep out of their way and capture the scene at the same time . But that 's just part of the problem confronted by Ross , who knew that the movie 's credibility hinged on the track scenes ' feeling authentic . Equines , it turns out , do n't adjust well to the rigors of filmmaking . To name a few logistical problems : The horses take only three strides to go from 0 to 30 mph , while it takes a camera mounted on the back of a truck one sixteenth of a mile to do the same . Forget about placing cameras on the track : The glint of the sun on a lens could easily spook these edgy half-ton babies . ( The solution : Some jockeys complement the trucks by wearing tiny cameras on their helmets . ) And forget multiple takes , says producer Frank Marshall . The thoroughbreds can run only a short distance at high speed , and then it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , needs to be tightly coordinated . Every morning , the filmmakers and on-set horsemen-including Hall of Fame jockey Chris McCarron , who served as the movie 's horse-and-race consultant-spend an hour charting every turn as if it were a chess game . Pale pink and sherbet green My Little Pony toys subbing for the real thing are manually moved along a 50-foot makeshift oval laid out in the Santa Anita betting hall . The doll standing in for Seabiscuit is easily identifiable : It 's the one with a tiny stuffed dog on his back . Laughs Marshall , who 's overseeing the racetrack camera crew , " It 's a highly technical operation here . " Meanwhile , out on the real track , the activity is far more organic . After one perfect take , the jockeys dismount . With an average height of 5 foot 2 and dressed in brilliant silks now splattered with mud and a **28;2803;TOOLONG brown , viscous coating , they look like a cross between a lollipop kid and a geisha who 's weathered a bad night . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused look . " There 's horse shit everywhere . " That 's polite compared with what can go on in the inner sanctum of the jockeys ' locker room . Behind these closed doors , many a panicked rider who has n't quite dropped to racing weight-around 115 pounds-performs a last and desperate rite called flipping ( otherwise known as puking your guts out ) . Maguire insists that his own weight loss , though , did not involve any flipping . Between Spider-Man and Seabiscuit , he says , " I know a frightening amount about training and how to achieve certain results . " And while he already had some riding experience thanks to his role in 1999 's Ride With the Devil , he needed to concentrate on getting " jockey " lean . So for two months , six days a week , four hours a day , he worked out under the eye of McCarron , conditioning himself on a machine called the Equicizer . " Tobey 's a perfectionist , " notes Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens , who costars as famed rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jockey . " TO HEAR OTHERS TELL IT , IT WAS also around this time that Maguire became a bit of an egoist . As he was finishing up Seabiscuit , Sony 's Spider-Man 2 was entering preproduction . The actor was tired , an old back injury was flaring up , and he asked the studio to rearrange the movie 's shooting schedule to accommodate him . The studio made it easier on him than he 'd anticipated . A couple of days later , they replaced him with The Good Girl 's Jake Gyllenhaal . And a couple of more days later ... Maguire suddenly developed second thoughts . In stepped Ron Meyer , the president of Universal and , coincidentally , the father of Maguire 's current girlfriend , Jennifer . Meyer reportedly was crucial in helping the actor make amends with the studio , and Spidey was back in business . Says Columbia 's copresident of production , Matt Tolmach , " Tobey 's been incredible ; the movie is , knock wood , going perfectly ; and we could n't be happier . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , Maguire fired the Gersh Agency 's Leslie Siebert , who had represented him for seven years , and hopped to CAA , the agency cofounded by Meyer . Weeks later , even Maguire seems unclear on what happened . He claims his riding duties on Seabiscuit did n't cause his back to act up . " For whatever reason , " he says , " because of my particular thing , the bent-over posture on a horse opens up my inflamed area . When you get up into a good gallop , it 's not so bad . " Maguire also insists he was n't trying to dodge his responsibilities ( he 's contractually obligated to three Spider-Mans ) . " I was never trying not to do Spider-Man 2 , " he says , choosing his words more carefully than usual . " There was some miscommunication , some misunderstanding , and I did n't communicate as ... um ... as early and as thoroughly as I should have . " But , he adds , " it 's all water under the bridge , the vibe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth is , Maguire knows he needs the Spider-Man franchise . " It 's not generally what I would pursue , " he allows . But when he was first presented with the Spider-Man projects , " at that point , there was an aspect of wanting to have less opposition at studios and more invites . " Well , that 's worked out . Every studio wants the Spider-Man magic for its movies , and the first-look producing deal Sony gave Maguire is making him something of a force behind the screen as well . Since its inception a few years ago , Maguire 's company has produced Spike Lee 's 25th Hour , and Maguire himself hooked up with old friend Connolly to help him produce his short film Whatever We Do , which is now being rewritten as a feature . " I was going to do this on my video camera , " says Connolly , " and suddenly Tobey gets involved and I have Nick Cassavetes doing a rewrite on the script and Robert Downey Jr . starring . Any of Tobey 's friends can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds . If Maguire is n't around , it 's only because " his life is scheduled down to the minute . " Which does n't leave Maguire much time to enjoy his newfound wealth and status-let alone take a long-needed vacation . Ask him what he likes to do during his free time and he looks perplexed . " You mean a day off , day off ? Like I do n't have to read anything ? I do n't have to watch a film for any kind of purpose ? " He pauses . " I like eating popcorn and other little treats at the movie theater . I like hanging out with my friends , playing videogames , board games , going to tropical locations . " Unfortunately , there are no tropical locations anywhere in Maguire 's near future-Spider-Man 2 will be filming until October-and he admits to being run-down . " Actually , I 'm trying to force myself into taking downtime , because otherwise I 'll work all the time , " he says . But he has no complaints . " I love working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances doing much more important things ... " He pauses to finish off his corn dog . " You know what ? I 'm just making movies .
