A monthly update of the best desktop PCs , notebooks , printers , monitors , graphics boards , and modems // IT 'S GETTING TOUGH to tell the cheetahs from the alley cats on our TOP 30 desktop charts . Four-legged speed typically comes paired with fearsome prices , but we 've recently started seeing some very fleet systems prowling our midrange chart . Normally , the hottest new machines debut on the power chart and then migrate to the midrange Top 10 as they grow older and cheaper . This month , two fast models debut on the midrange chart . Micro Express tops our midrange list with its new $1499 MicroFlex-700A ( AMD Athlon-700 power inside ) , while Quantex snares third place with a fast new Pentium III-667 system , the SM667 , at $1749 . The money you save has to come from somewhere ; where are these vendors cutting their costs ? STRAY CATS SHOW CLAWS-AND FLAWS COMPARED TO THE big cats occupying the power chart , the MicroFlex and the SM667 scrimp on some components , but depending on what you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MicroFlex uses an ATI Rage Pro graphics card , which was merely middle-of-the-road a year ago but remains more than adequate for business use . MicroExpress includes a DVD  --  ROM drive , but it 's an older , 6X version . For its part , Quantex supplies a lower-quality 17  --  inch monitor-no Trinitron here . Neither bundles any pricey business software , and you certainly do n't get extras such as a Zip or CD-RW drive , or even a network card . These systems are great if you need something fast and lean-and you want to put off upgrades for another day . However , remember that those upgrades-a new graphics board here , a removable media drive there-can cost much more when purchased off the shelf than when obtained as part of a system bundle . BONUS BUSINESS FEATURES TWO NEW ACER MODELs-the AcerPower 4400 and AcerPower 8600-feature extras that corporate buyers expect . Acer not only equipped each with a case lock , but added chassis intrusion detection as well . A button under the exterior panel connects via a wire to the motherboard ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an IS manager via the company network when anyone opens the system , thereby protecting the company 's investment . The 4400 also includes a network interface card with Wake  --  on-LAN , a feature that lets you or your MIS guru boot it remotely for software installations during off-peak hours . Neither Acer PC made it onto the charts this month , but you can read reviews of them at PC World Online . Other units on our charts do offer some of these corporate features , including the Dell OptiPlex GX100 and the Gateway E-1400 , both of which made our Top 10 Budget PCs chart . Corporate features can differentiate companies ' product lines . Dell 's OptiPlex models include them , but its Dimension PCs do not . Other corporate-focused lines are Compaq 's Deskpro , Gateway 's Enterprise , HP 's Vectra , and Micron 's ClientPro . For the home , Compaq offers the Presario line , Gateway the Essential , HP the Pavilion , and Micron the Millennia . While remote diagnostic and monitoring features are rarely necessary for home users , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may support hundreds of PCs . They may not always make the charts , but systems such as the AcerPower units receive bonus points in our grading system for providing these business extras . - Joel Strauch POINT YOUR browser to www. pcworld.com/to for late  --  breaking reviews of desktop computers .

Only the best products land on the Top 10 charts , which are refreshed monthly . System configurations are shown as tested . Vendors may have since changed components . What does the overall rating mean ? This 100-point scale reflects results from our hands-on evaluations and performance tests . A score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70s is above average . What does the PC WorldBench 98 score mean ?
