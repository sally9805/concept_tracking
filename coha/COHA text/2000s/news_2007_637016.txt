<p> Responses to " Black history month : Reunion pays homage to all-black school , " AJC Gwinnett News , Feb. 6 <p> Historical Society should get in on this <p> A ( Hooper-Renwick School ) reunion such as this would be a perfect opportunity for the Gwinnett Historial Society to interview and record those who attend so the history of the time will never be lost or swept under the rug . <p> Unlike most reunions where people boast of their individual accomplishments , at this reunion all can boast on the progress they made as a whole , besides the personal accomplishments . <p> The only question I have is what took them so long to celebrate what must have been at the very least an extremely confusing time . <p> BRUCE WILCOX , Lilburn <p> Hooper-Renwick reunion a great idea <p> How excellent ! There 's nothing like paying tribute and giving honor when and where it 's due . <p> Thank you to Rick Badie .

This recognition is long overdue in many cases . <p> I can also appreciate the Hispanic recognition . <p> What I do n't understand is the recognition of just two groups when the United States has numerous groups , and each is equally important . <p> If we have appreciation weeks and months for some , there should be appreciation for all . Some groups never get credit . What about the numerous Chinese immigrants coming to Gwinnett or the doctors coming from India ? Our country prides itself on diversity , yet only a few groups are put on a pedestal for a period of time each year . <p> Martin Luther King Jr . represented equality .

I knew those kids loved Connie , and their " Conniefest " was awesome . <p> Thank you also for your piece concerning Hooper-Renwick School . My son attended the school from 1996 to 2000 , and I am sorry to say I never knew the origins of Hooper-Renwick . I am proud and happy to know these origins and still very proud of the work Hooper does . <p> While we fought tooth and nail to keep our son out of Hooper at the beginning , when their work was done , Hooper-Renwick and its staff had done a marvelous job . My husband and I and our son cried as he departed this great institution for Berkmar High , where he graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planners , developers need to look to the Chinese <p> Since we lack innovative visionaries in Gwinnett County 's leadership , we probably should borrow from those who have sucessfully dealt with similar situations . <p> I strongly suggest that city planners and developers research how the Chinese are transforming their cities , and doing so quite successfully in improving the quality of life for its residents . Start with Shanghai as a case study and take the cues from that point . <p> The county government , in concert with development leaders , needs to create a holistic plan and development road map for Gwinnett and develop this in stages accordingly . ( If such a plan exists , then its implementation needs to be more effectively managed . ) <p> We can not continue to allow each business development to just develop what it thinks is necessary , without understanding impact to the county at large . Infrastructure components such as roads , health services , utilities ( water , electricity , sanitation ) , education facilities , recreational resources must be all part and parcel of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all its parts need to work in concert for the good of the entire body . <p> So we want to build shopping malls . Then have a comprehensive vision and blueprint for developing these . Too many eyesore mini-malls , adjacent to each other , with limited connectivity between them . <p> It seems where there is a vacant piece of property , the solution is to put a building of some type on it without adequate consideration for impact and integration on the surrounding communities . <p> It seems every developer does that which is right in his own eyes . Encourage developers to pool their resources and work together instead of allowing each developer to drive and steer the development of the county to his own limited ends . <p> Until such approaches are seriously considered then we will continue to trap ourselves into paralysis . Paraphrasing a verse from the Bible , " Without a vision , the people perish " <p> GLENN STEVENS , Lilburn <p> Coach 's concern has impacted so many lives <p> I want to thank you for the wonderful article about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes all out to get his players noticed , AJC Gwinnett News , Feb. 11 ) . <p> My son , Louis Nava , wrestled at Dunwoody High School under Reggie . You have no idea how blessed we have been to have Reggie in our lives and the wonderful impact he had on Louis . <p> Unfortunately , Louis was murdered in a carjacking in June of 1998 , but Reggie has always been there for our family , and it has meant so much to us the way he has kept Louis ' memory alive . <p> Justin Thomas , the young man going to Georgetown , received the Louis Nava Award this past year , and I had the honor of presenting it to him at the Meadowcreek Athletic Banquet . The Louis Nava Memorial Fund also had the privilege of sending six of Reggie 's players to football camp this past summer . It means so much to us to be able to support what he does for his athletes . He always has what 's in their best interest , first and foremost . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the friendship we have with Reggie is something we truly cherish . This past summer , my brother , Reggie , and my 16-year-old son all went fishing in Monticello . He continues to have such a positive impact on my younger children . <p> Thank you for writing such a deserving piece on a remarkable man . We need more people like him in the educational setting who truly care about our kids and want them to see the potential they have inside of them . <p> LAURA B. LYNN , Dunwoody <p> Others should adopt barber 's perspective <p> Thank you for ( " All the world 's problems get solved , one haircut at a time , " AJC Gwinnett News , Feb. 1 ) . It shows that there are still people in this world with a heart and core values . <p> Mr. Douglas Dubose would be a good candidate to be a missionary , doing the work of the Lord . I think his point of view on life needs to be copied by a lot of people . He is a true mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pray for success with his church . ... <p> I am a white male in his 30s , and a man like Dubose who lives for Christ and is obedient to God lives for a melting pot because every man and woman is a child of Christ . Neither nationality nor skin color makes a difference . Just like the Bible says : " Love thy neighbor . " <p> We need more barbershops and people like Mr. Dubose . <p> JACK BEAVERS , Canton <p> Area needs hotline to help people find pets <p> I live in North Carolina now but used to live in the Atlanta area and I lost a dog there . A neighbor was visiting us recently from Gainesville and brought the newspaper , and I was attracted to the story of the teacher 's kindness ( " Teacher 's kindness reunites man , dog , " AJC Gwinnett News , Jan. 28 ) . <p> Looking for dogs in the Atlanta area is a real problem . I think there ought to be some central hotline in the Atlanta area people can call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pets and should be in the phonebooks . If people were more educated about finding pets or finding owners , the shelters might be less crowded . <p> The animal shelters and humane societies are two different groups . Sometimes they have a file for lost-and-found animals and will take the name and number and description of an animal in case someone is looking for it . <p> However , if a dog has been rescued by an individual , the animal may be taken to the area where the person lives or works . It will end up in a different place , even a different county . People do n't know to check all the animal shelters . There is DeKalb , Fulton , Hall , Forsyth , Rockdale , Gwinnett , Cherokee and others . <p> Shelters often do not tell people they have their dog because people do n't describe the dog the same way . The shelters have so many animals coming in , it would be a full-time job . The only way to find out if they have your dog is to go look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only days before they are put up for adoption , and as time passes and space is limited , many are euthanized . <p> There are also rescue groups that take certain breeds . These people do a lot for animals , but one thing I do n't think they do enough of is try to find their original homes . They have them neutered and adopt them out . <p> A pet owner also should notify as many vets as possible and take a picture flyer . These could be all over the Atlanta area , not just in the place where the dog was lost . <p> Just because a dog had on a collar and tags when lost does n't mean they can be identified if they are taken to a shelter . Sometimes dogs slip out of their collars or the tags are obsolete . A call to animal control with the rabies tag information might work , but often the dog is found over a weekend when that information is not available . <p> I actually visited many shelters looking for my dog and at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers engraved , and I took down these numbers and called people . They had not been notified . Do n't assume anyone will do this for you . <p> One of the best ways these days to protect your pet is to have it " chipped . " This microchip will be easily put in the folds of its neck with a needle ( like a shot ) by a vet . The chip is about the size of a grain of rice . If a dog is hurt and taken to a vet , the vet can run a wand over its neck and a number will come up . The number is registered with the company who makes the chip , and the owner is identified . I wish I had known more about this before I lost my dog . <p> My dog Cleo was an older female beagle who was deaf . She had gotten out of our car when my mother had left the door open at a parking garage at Northside Hospital . We were away on a trip at the time and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we returned . My mother thought since she had on a tag and a collar someone would call . No one did . <p> A witness told us they saw her being picked up in a car right in front of the hospital on April 9 , 1999 . There were flyers on every pole , an article in the paper , all kinds of vets notified and many visits to the shelters , etc. , but the person never tried or did n't know how to try and help this dog find its way home . Many people think a dog has been dumped and some are , but many are just lost . <p> I hope Oreo gets well . <p> SHARLA GARDNER , Jamestown , N.C. Photo : Oreo/ImageData*
