Hollywood agents do n't get pity . They get 10% . But spare a kind thought for Johnny Depp 's agent , Tracy Jacobs . For more than a decade , her client  --  one of the world 's best actors and best-looking human beings  --  has consistently turned down glamorous leading-man roles in large , profitable movies so that he could play a chorus of memorable ( to those who saw them ) character parts , like Cesar , the Gypsy horseman in The Man Who Cried , or Bon Bon , the Cuban transvestite prostitute who smuggles prison contraband in his rectum in Before Night Falls . Only Crispin Glover 's representatives have suffered more for their percentage . <P> " Tracy 's taken a lot of heat over the years , " says Depp . " She has bosses and higher-ups , and every time I take on another strange project , they 're going , ' Jesus Christ ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl ? When does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change ? When is he finally going to do a blockbuster ? ' " <P> In 2003 Depp did his blockbuster , Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl , which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and earned Disney $305 million . His Captain Jack Sparrow did n't kiss or shoot anybody , and he kind of sashayed through most of the film , but Pirates proved that with the right material , Depp can be a huge multiplex draw . His long-suffering agent did n't want him to take the part . " He was pitched the movie without a script , " recalls Jacobs . " They basically said , ' We 're going to make a movie out of this theme-park ride . Want to do it ? ' And he said , ' Great ! I 'm in . I believe in the idea . ' I just thought , What idea , you lunatic ? " <P> Now that he has blockbuster status and a surprise Screen Actors Guild award , prestige scripts are piling up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of owe it to the writer , I think , " he says  --  but he has no plans to try to fashion them into any kind of sensible mainstream career . Why start now ? " Nothing changes , " says Depp , who is in Wales shooting The Libertine , in which he plays the Earl of Rochester , a 17th century poet and pornographer who reportedly died of syphilis . " The challenge for me is still to do something that has n't been beaten into the moviegoing consciousness . Otherwise what am I in it for ? <P> The dough ? Well , the dough is cool , but I do n't want to be 85 years old and have my grandkids go , ' Ewwww . Grandpa did some dumb s . ' I 'd rather have them say , ' Wow , man , you 're nuts ! ' " <P> As proof of his willingness to be thought insane , Depp 's first post-Pirates movie is Secret Window , in theaters this Friday . He plays Mort Rainey , a successful writer being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends , for reasons too crucial to the plot to fully explain , Mort manically consumes the equivalent of Iowa 's annual corn harvest . But that 's not the crazy part . " Much of the first half of the movie is just Mort in a cabin by himself not doing things , " says Secret Window 's writer-director , David Koepp , a man you would expect to have a vested interest in making the movie sound a bit more dynamic .
