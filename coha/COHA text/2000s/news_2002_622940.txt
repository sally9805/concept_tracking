<p> In the rocky sand of the high desert , the engine of a 26-ton armored personnel carrier rumbles to life and the big machine 's rear hatch drops to the ground . <p> Ten dirty , dusty Marines run screaming down the ramp into the sand and sprint 20 yards . They drop with several thuds behind scrub brush and sand mounds ; their rifles , machines , rocket launchers and mortars quickly point at an unseen enemy . <p> " Get up , " barks a sergeant . " Do it again ! " <p> Some of the guys moan , others joke as they dust the ever-present sand from their M-16s and climb back aboard the tracked vehicle and prepare to assault the desert again . <p> It 's dirty , repetitive work designed to simulate actual combat conditions . Here at the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms , Marines fire real bullets , real tank shells explode on hillsides and helicopters fire real missiles onto fake targets . <p> Training has stepped up a notch these days , as talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pushed almost to full strength , and many of the slots are being filled with young privates right out of boot camp . <p> " Getting a lot of new guys tells me something is going on , " said Capt . Kevin Norton , commander of Kilo Company , of the 3rd Battalion , 4th Marine Regiment . <p> The Marines do n't like to talk about Iraq . They like to say they train to fight anyone , any time . But the specter of another go-round with the Iraqis is on everyone 's mind . <p> " You have to make your men believe they could go to war tomorrow , " Norton said . " It does n't matter where it is . If you 're in Okinawa , you tell them they could fight in Korea . You have to take this seriously . " <p> GULF WAR EXPERIENCE <p> If there is a war in Iraq , it will be familiar territory for a lot of Marines and soldiers . The ranks of the senior noncommissioned officers and officers are filled with people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . <p> Norton , for example , was an enlisted man last time , in the artillery . <p> He teaches his men the importance of adapting to the desert terrain of the combat center , which is nearly identical to that of Iraq . Sometimes you have to get a pickax to pound through solid rock , other times use sand bags to shore up foxholes surrounded by loose sand . <p> " You 've got to get them deep into the sand , deep enough so that a tank can roll over your position and not kill you , " said Norton , as the rattle of a .50-caliber machine gun echoed across the rocky hills . <p> And then there 's the fog of war , which he knew intimately from his experiences in Iraq in 1991 . With his artillery battery firing shell after shell , somehow an Iraqi infantry unit stumbled upon them . The Marines scrambled for rifles that had been set aside . As it turns out , the Iraqis were there to surrender . <p> " The only thing this one guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " Norton said . " That night , the Marines offered up their ponchos to help these guys keep warm . But it was all a learning experience . " <p> Master Sgt. D.L. Sawyer , who drove an armored assault vehicle in the Gulf War , said Vietnam veterans used to be somewhat reluctant to talk about their experiences , because of all the negativity surrounding the war . These days , he said , Gulf War vets use their knowledge to expand training . <p> " I know one guy who makes his men practice five words in Iraqi every day , " Sawyer said . <p> ESSENTIAL COMBAT TASKS <p> Lt. Col. B.L . McCoy , commanding officer of 3rd Battalion , said the training focuses on the basics  --  the idea being to ingrain essential combat tasks into each Marine , so they operate efficiently in the event of war . <p> He stresses leadership most of all , because the squad leaders and platoon commanders are the ones who must mold the young Marines and keep them alive on the battlefield . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things like getting personal affairs in order , so the Marines know their families are safe and secure without them . And training the combat corpsmen  --  the Marines ' version of medics  --  who will tend to the wounded . <p> McCoy said the corpsmen , who are actually sailors in Marine garb , spend time at trauma centers and some are soon to go to a cadaver lab . <p> " The first time they see a sucking chest wound should not be on the battlefield where lives are at stake , " McCoy said . <p> No matter where they might fight , the Marines need to go into battle " with a happy heart , " McCoy said . <p> So the Marines spend time in the desert , going from range to range , practicing different skills . They hang out with tanks , the high-tech M-1 Abrams , and learn how to communicate with the crew , how to help direct fire and how to stay out of the way of the 65-ton behemoths . <p> " This tank is dangerous , " barked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will kill you . If you 're behind it and this thing starts backing up , it 'll roll right over you and your weapon and not even register it . Stay alert . " <p> Staff Sgt. Nick Papaditch , platoon sergeant with the 1st Tank Battalion , brought a half-dozen tanks to the range for the infantry to work with . He , too , fought in the Gulf War . <p> IRAQIS UNDISCIPLINED <p> " I do n't want to tell this to the troops , because I do n't want anyone to be over-confident , but I 'm not worried a bit about fighting the Iraqis again , " he said . " They have no battle discipline and they broke ranks . " Which means they simply cut and ran . <p> If anything , he said , the Iraqis might have gained more from their brief encounter with U.S. troops . Officers and NCOs in the Iraqi military , he said , are most likely teaching their soldiers how to fight Americans , and how to deal with U.S. battle tactics . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank warfare , Papaditch said . The M-1 is superior to any other tank in the world , he said . Its 120mm cannon is controlled by a computer that takes into account everything from wind direction to ammo temperature when the trigger is pulled . The vehicle has high-tech optics and other devices to turn night into day . <p> BAY AREA GRUNTS <p> Still , the war will be won or lost with the individual fighting men , the infantrymen who call themselves " grunts . " Several members of the 3rd Battalion are from the Bay Area . They 're a bunch of young , fresh-faced kids from Oakland , San Francisco , Santa Clara , pretty much all over . But they hold their well-worn weapons with an easy grace and exude an air of confidence . <p> " We 've got a whole lot of new guys , " said Austin Olivieri of Oakland , all of 21 himself . " We 're trying to bring them up to speed . " <p> William Riggs of Benicia is one of the older guys . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 . <p> Like many of the Marines , up and down the ranks , Riggs is married . He said he and his wife do n't talk too much about the possibility of war . <p> " She 's doing all right with it , " he said . " Our wives pretty much know this is always a possibility . When they marry us , they have to take the whole package . I try to keep her informed about where we are with all this , but the bottom line is , if we go , we go . " <p> The Bay Area is well known , of course , for its anti-war activism , but most of the Bay Area Marines said they encountered no problems with anyone because of their military service . <p> Lawrence " Doc " Santos , 21 , a Navy corpsman , said he never talks about the military with his friends when he goes home to San Francisco on leave . He said he would get too much grief . <p> But Riggs said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anti-war protesting , and gotten only friendly questions about why he joined and what he does . <p> LIFE TURNED AROUND <p> The Bay Area group was ambivalent about life in the Marines . " There are good days and bad days , " Riggs said with a shrug . <p> But Olivieri said the Marines had turned his life around . <p> " I did a 180 with my life , " he said . " I like it that people are proud of me , now . " <p> Markos Eugenios , 21 , of San Jose , said he likes to know that the work he does makes a difference . <p> " It 's not just about earning a paycheck , " he said . " I 'm doing something with my life . " <p> With that , the men disperse , back to their training . They carry huge packs , along with their mortar tubes and buckets of 7.62mm machine-gun ammo . <p> After a quick bite of MREs ( Meal , Ready to Eat ) , they 're back with the tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out where to stand when that big cannon goes off . <p> As some finish that training , there 's some down time . But there 's no time to waste these days , so another sergeant gathers his squad leaders around and gives the word : " Work ' em . " <p> The men hustle back to their squads and fire teams , and hustle them into the brush and sand . Here , they practice patrol tactics , rifles at the ready , moving in a quick but light-footed step . <p> As a cannon booms from the other side of the hill , the men fan out and work their way down into the valley . <p> The battalion commander , McCoy , said his men need more time in the field and more ammo to help their training . Money is always an issue , he said , and there never seem to be enough bullets and artillery shells to go around . <p> So the Marines improvise . They get old bowling pins from bowling alleys and set them out in the desert , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Overall , though , I think things are going very well , " he said . " You can always do more , and that 's what keeps me awake nights . " <p> E-mail John Koopman at **33;3973;TOOLONG
