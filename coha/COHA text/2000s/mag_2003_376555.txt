The back of the Scion xB looks as if it had been chopped off in a body-shop accident . But take the runt for a spin , and you may be smitten . Scion is Toyota 's new youth-oriented brand , and the xB , starting at $14,165 , delivers a combination of style , pluck and Toyota-backed quality that teenagers ( or parents footing the bill ) may find tough to beat . The xB is another reason Toyota is on track for a record fiscal year . In its first half , the six months ending Sept. 30 , global revenues rose 8% to $75.4 billion , and profits soared 23% to $4.8 billion . The xB 's boxy shape lends the car a roomy feel inside , and its cloth upholstery , uncluttered cockpit and attention to tactile detail raise the standard for such a low-priced car . Toyota crammed it with features : antilock brakes , power windows , air conditioning and a six-speaker stereo . Rough spots : the car 's suspension jolts the spine , and the noisy 108-h.p. engine wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city traffic . Since Scion 's launch on the West Coast in June in a phased U.S. rollout , Toyota has sold more than 4,000 xBs ( and more than 2,300 of the hatchback xA ) , exceeding the carmaker 's initial expectations and suggesting that this pug 's legs may be longer than they look .  --  By Daren Fonda
