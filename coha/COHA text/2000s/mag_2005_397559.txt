An ambitious young magazine editor and a tormented photographer together discovered a Marilyn Monroe nobody knew <p> ONE AFTERNOON IN 1955 I WAS STARING INTO A GLASS OF SCOTCH AT the Gladstone Hotel in Manhattan . I had downed several , but they failed to subdue my panic . I was jammed up , and my only hope , sitting across the table and smiling serenely , was my friend Sam Shaw . <p> As a young editor at Redbook I had been praised and promoted , which led me to overreach so far that my job was now hanging by the thinnest thread - Sam 's connection to Marilyn Monroe . <p> After leaving Hollywood to study at the Actors Studio , Marilyn retreated from the spotlight . For the first time in her flashbulb life she was dodging photographers and reporters . <p> After two dozen movies , a headline marriage , and a headline divorce , she was in New York to prepare for parts like Grushenka in The Brothers Karamazov . The papers dug out all the clichs about comedians who want to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year Itch , Marilyn on the subway grate , an updraft billowing the white dress over her hips . She avoided the press almost entirely , and that made her even more desirable . A hard-to-get Marilyn was news . <p> My crisis began when I did something way out of character . I saw an ill-lit print of her in an Actors Studio class , covered by a camel 's hair coat and no makeup . A line flashed through my head : THE MARILYN MONROE YOU 'VE NEVER SEEN , and with no hesitation I persuaded my boss to engrave it on the July cover , which went to press 10 days before the rest of the magazine . I was jumping out of a plane without knowing if the parachute would open . <p> As I took the plunge , I knew who would be with me - my best friend , the photographer Ed Feingersh , who knew all about parachuting . Some of his daring must have rubbed off on me , and we sat in Costello 's saloon planning our assault on Fortress Marilyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me that while he was a daredevil , Eddie had no gifts as a stalker . The first afternoon he waited for hours in the lobby of Marilyn 's hotel , took a minute to make a phone call , and returned to find some kids waving the little Kodak Brownies that were the ubiquitous inexpensive camera of the day : " She posed for us ! " <p> With blank pages looming in the July issue , I called Sam , a photographer who wanted to be a movie producer and had worked hard at friendships with Hollywood 's rising generation , among them Elia Kazan , Marion Brando , and Marilyn . Sam and I had once shared an office , and he agreed to help . <p> At the Gladstone , Sam had called Marilyn on the house phone . As usual she was running late . We were nursing our drinks when a tall , tanned man looked into the room and headed for the table . <p> " Sam , how are you ? " said Joe DiMaggio , sitting down . " Marilyn told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , avoiding reporters as usual , DiMaggio had been seen leaving divorce court in obvious sorrow and anger . Now here he was , fresh from his former wife 's room , talking , almost babbling about her with a schoolboy smile on his face , telling Sam how happy he was that she was away from " that movie crowd . " Moreover , the notoriously jealous DiMaggio was pressing him to see more of Marilyn . " She wants you to take her antiquing again , " he said , getting up to leave . He gave me a quick nod and smile . <p> A few minutes later Sam put me on the house phone , and in that familiar breathy voice , Marilyn agreed to do the picture story , suggesting we meet for a drink the next afternoon . <p> " Why , " Marilyn asked soon after we sat down , " do they print things about me that are n't true ? " <p> It was not a rhetorical question or a complaint . We were in a cocktail lounge , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled expression , waiting for an answer . Up close , her face was pale and fragile , with no Technicolor glow , and her eyes had none of the confidence that radiated from the screen . <p> Within minutes it was clear she had no small talk , no social defenses . Sam had told me , if you ask , " How are you ? , " she will stop to think instead of coming back with an automatic " Fine . " And when she asked a question , she waited for an answer . <p> " Why do they make up stuff ? " she persisted . <p> I took the plunge . " Because pictures of you sell papers and magazines , and when there 's no excuse for running them , they 'll print rumors and gossip , anything they can get . " Something pushed me to go further : " They do n't mean to hurt you , just use you . " <p> She looked at me with a flinching smile that said she knew all about being used . It set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publisher of Look , telling of a visit to Twentieth Century-Fox in the late 1940s , when a studio head remarked , " We have a new girl on the lot with something unusual . Instead of sticking straight out , her tits tilt up . " He sent for Marilyn , who came in smiling , and he lifted her sweater to show what he meant . She never stopped smiling . <p> We talked about Sam for a while , and then Marilyn said , " There 's another reason I 'm doing this : Your magazine never made fun of me . " Her eyes brightened . " Even gave me an award . " <p> I felt accepted and at the same time burdened with her trust . The most famously sexual woman in the world was being childlike and vulnerable but also using her openness to get what she wanted for a few days : my loyalty . All her life that mixture of innocence and guile had apparently drawn protectors and betrayers , many of them the same people . <p> It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a call from Milton Greene , a mediocre photographer and world-class hustler who had persuaded her to form a partnership with him called Marilyn Monroe Productions . We can do the story , he said , but only with a photographer on his payroll . I told him to get lost , and when Eddie and I met Marilyn the next day , I related the shakedown attempt . She frowned , and we started on our story . ( It took her a while to get the full picture , but eventually she fired Greene for mismanagement . ) <p> I told Marilyn we wanted to show her as she really was : no poses , no blowing kisses to the camera , no studio setups , just a straight look at her life . <p> In the heyday of 35mm cameras and available light , Eddie worshiped Henri Cartier-Bresson , whose pictures were being shown not only in magazines but in museums . His idol would not allow prints to be cropped , and neither would Eddie . The " decisive moment " was framed in the photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like taking slices off a Renoir or van Gogh . At a time when Italian and French films were showing up Hollywood fluff , Eddie and others were transforming traditional frozen magazine pictures with on-the-fly realism . The world was going grainy . <p> Alone among them , Eddie wanted to go beyond witnessing an event with the camera , to enter it and show how it looked from the inside - risking himself for moments nobody had ever seen . He took pictures while crawling with patrols in Korea , lashed to the periscope of a diving submarine , jumping from a plane with paratroops . Back home , on a racetrack with Irish Horan 's Lucky Hell Drivers , he crouched , elbows hugging his body , between boards tented at a 45-degree angle while speeding cars careened by so close he could see the ply marks on their tires . <p> Short , thin , and stooped , with a face far from handsome , Eddie was magnetic for everyone who knew him . He was as passionate about friendship as work . He was an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting moments take him wherever they would . Costello 's was more home than hangout . He must have had an apartment or room somewhere , but in all our years as close friends , I never saw it . He got his mail and phone messages at Costello 's and spent every evening in town at the bar , as people he knew came and went , moving a few feet to a table for food and later , if the mood was right , slipping coins into the pay phone to ask some young woman to call her friends while a few of us brought over a bottle to drink and flirt away the night . His energy was unending . He would spend hours talking excitedly , gesturing , scrawling his version of Thurber dogs on napkins , getting up to pace around , crouched like Groucho in a serpentine glide . Life with him was never at a standstill . <p> Tracking Marilyn , Eddie 's camera was telling more than we knew at the time . The public Marilyn was keeping appointments - fittings for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circus , meetings with lawyers and agents ( Twentieth Century-Fox had suspended her for decamping ) , a grand entrance in white furs at the opening night of Tennessee Williams 's new play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof . Before going out , she put on a performance with the stopper from a bottle of Chanel No. 5 , stroking her skin in sensuous delight . <p> But between moments of being seen , there was another Marilyn , suddenly drained of energy , like the air being let out of a balloon . She sat in a darkening hotel room with drink in hand and went out on the terrace to stare unseeing at the Manhattan skyline . Eddie 's shutter kept clicking , and rolls of 35mm film filled up with images of THE MARILYN MONROE YOU 'VE NEVER SEEN : withdrawn and alone . He never asked her to pose . She hardly knew he was there . <p> Marilyn had never been in a subway . Wrapped in the camel 's hair coat , her famous hair subdued , she walked to the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody recognized her . Eddie 's camera kept clicking while she stood strap-hanging on the uptown local . No heads turned . <p> Back up on the street , Marilyn looked around with a teasing smile . " Do you want to see her ? " she asked , then took off the coat , fluffed up her hair , and arched her back in a pose . In an instant she was engulfed , and it took several shoving , scary minutes to rewrap her and push clear of the growing crowd . <p> The two Marilyns kept fading in and out . At the costume fitting she arrived as the Star , commanding a swarm of tailors , seamstresses , and hangers-on until the Other abruptly emerged and burst into tears of frustration over some detail of the garment . Eddie 's camera got it all , showing her rising tension against a visual jangle of wire hangers in the background . He framed the scene in the fragmented hall-of-mirrors unreality Orson Welles had created around Rita Hayworth for the finale of The Lady From Shanghai . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the day , and we took her to Costello 's . By then John McNulty had been writing about the place in The New Yorker for years , but the proprietor , Tim Costello , managed to keep it from changing . A stern look over his teacup at the back table was more effective than the rules committee of any private club . Costello 's never went trendy in the way a cabdriver once said of another saloon , " Nobody goes there anymore . It 's too crowded . " <p> Behind the long bar was a blackthorn walking stick that had been broken over John O'Hara 's head by Ernest Hemingway , no one remembered why . On the facing wall were huge drawings on beaverboard by James Thurber , so valued by Tim that he had had them inked over , varnished , and , when he was forced to move his establishment next door , carefully removed and remounted . The panels were brown with age and tobacco smoke . <p> Thurber had filled the walls with images of cowardly canines ( a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge women ( " I 'm leaving you , Myra , you might as well get used to the idea , " says one in the clutch of an Amazon several times his size ) . Such self-mocking masculinity suited the place . Tim did not abide noisy , pugnacious drunks . <p> Marilyn was wearing a black sleeveless blouse and striped slacks . She sat next to the Thurber drawings at a table across from the bar . <p> Tim , usually wary of strangers , was clearly intrigued by the blaze of blonde hair at our table and , in a rare gesture , came over to take the orders himself . <p> " A screwdriver please , " Marilyn said . <p> Tim was expressionless . <p> " Vodka and orange juice , " she added . <p> Tim kept looking at her . " We do n't serve breakfast here , " he said . <p> " O.K. , " Marilyn said agreeably , " vodka on the rocks . " <p> Tim gave the order to his brother Joe at the bar and went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the men 's room , Tim stopped him . <p> " Who is she ? " <p> Eddie smiled . " Marilyn Monroe . " <p> Tim 's face darkened . " I ask a civil question and you get smart . " <p> Eddie smiled again and Tim went back to his paper . <p> In the hour there no one else gave Marilyn more than a quick look . As she was leaving , a photographer at the bar tapped Eddie on the arm . " If you come back later , " he stage-whispered , " bring your little friend . " <p> The pictures in Redbook , with my text and captions , showed an unfamiliar , vulnerable Marilyn in soft shades of black and gray . The opening spread contrasted her solitary sadness with a long shot of 200 photographers almost trampling the elephant she was riding at the circus . <p> In their days together , despite the disparity in looks , I could see Eddie and Marilyn were much alike . They both were somehow more directly connected to life than the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie was given to self-parody to mask the pain of being defenseless against daily living and , like her , desperate to make full use of the gifts such an open nature provides . <p> Just as Marilyn dreaded looking less than perfect in front of the cameras and was always late , so Eddie obsessed over what he did behind the camera and would let no one else develop or print his pictures . <p> Each held on to an ideal of Art as if it were life itself , and , as it turned out for both of them , it was . Marilyn 's movies and Eddie 's pictures made those who saw them feel more alive but at the same time fear for their safety , sensing the price that would have to be paid for their luminous openness . <p> Before the year was out , the Third Avenue el in front of Costello 's was torn down , removing the pillars Tim 's regulars would use to steady themselves while hailing cabs in the morning hours . <p> Marilyn 's stay in New York led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a conventional wife and mother in Connecticut while making a few movies that showed acting ability as well as amplitude of flesh and spirit . <p> Eddie got married , too , and then he was in the crisis of his life . <p> The Cliff was a bar on Twenty-third Street . Eddie used his last dime for the phone call , and I went down to keep him from going over the edge . <p> It had started to go bad a couple of years after the Marilyn story . After my wedding we saw each other less , and so it came as a surprise when he told me he was getting married . She was a blank beauty with high cheekbones and an impervious air who drifted through our times together in a detachment that seemingly spurred Eddie to pour all the energy he used to put into finding the perfect picture into solving her mystery . <p> At their wedding I was behind the camera , looking at incongruous images of a picture-book bride in white alongside Eddie 's dark suit and sheepish smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The marriage lasted a few months , during which he gradually worked less and less , then finally stopped altogether before his bride floated out of his life , leaving behind only her enigmatic stare . <p> After he called that evening , we sat for hours , trying to figure out what he could do , now that he was too paralyzed to do the one thing in life he was meant to do . Finally , I suggested an answer : " Come work for me . I need a picture editor . " <p> I was the editor of Redbook by then , and the idea made sense . If Eddie could no longer take pictures , he could imagine them , match photographers to subjects , and help them do good work until he could start doing his own again . <p> For a few months it went well . Once in a while , when he was excited about an assignment , I would say without looking at him , " Of course , you 'd be perfect for it , " or , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would freeze for a moment before his eyes went blank and he shook his head . <p> He cut down on his drinking , but the depression got worse . Gradually he came into the office less and less and finally not at all . Then came a phone call from a woman who had been in love with him for years . He had arrived at her door the evening before and died in his sleep during the night . <p> Over the years I had urged Eddie to try a psychiatrist , but my pleading could not break through his certainty that suffering was inseparable from his gift , that he could not escape one without losing the other . In today 's world he - and Marilyn , for that matter - might have been kept going by medication , but back then there was no such lifeline . <p> Ever since , those who loved Eddie 's work have tried to get museums to give him the recognition he deserves . But it has been no easier to help him in death than it was during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so closely held , scattered and disappeared , magnificent pictures lost forever . <p> Yet something of him remains alive , linked forever with that other lost soul . On Web sites , in many languages , people are selling prints of a few of those pictures Eddie took of Marilyn that week in 1955 . The negatives were found in a warehouse three decades after his death . <p> Marilyn has inspired rescue fantasies in legions of writers , among them Norman Mailer and Gloria Steinem . Toward the end of his life Arthur Miller looked back and saw himself that way . " I spent five years trying to keep her from falling off the cliff , " he told an interviewer in 2004 while justifying After the Fall , the nasty piece of self-pity he wrote soon after her death . <p> As Eddie 's would-be savior , I am left with no such soothing consolation , only an abiding sense of loss . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " Between moments of posing and primping , " remembered the author , " there was another Marilyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " Why , " Marilyn asked , and waited for an answer , " do they print things about me that are n't true ?
