SIMPLE SOLUTIONS Headnote be a better parent Headnote Your tension may be taking a toll on your kids . Here 's how to break the cycle . By Cindy Schweich Handler Photograph Fend off freak-outs ( yours and theirs ) by telling them why you 're frazzled. // It 's 6 p.m. and I 'm hammering away at my home computer at warp speed . This project is due first thing tomorrow morning , my three kids have studiously ignored their homework , and dinner ai n't exactly cooking itself . Suddenly my 11-year-old , Jay , bursts in with late-breaking news : He 's trained his guinea pig to stand up . " Cool ! " I say , then-remembering my deadline- " OK , now scoot . I want to be alone ! " I holler like a possessed Greta Garbo . Within minutes doors slam and his little sister screams , " Make him give back my goodie bag ! " Then she 's in tears . And I 'm screaming at them both . " My stomach hurts , " whines Jay , eyeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the face my 13-year-old makes when I 'm running late and go off on my **64;546;TOOLONG soliloquy . And it 's the expression Jay wears when he asks me the same math question three times before I realize he 's talking . We all have days when we 're so harried , we do n't notice that our kids are catching our stress . Yup , your jangled nerves are contagious . From the time they 're mere tots , kids can sense-and react to-your tension . " Research shows that when stressed parents frown , avert their eyes , and tighten their muscles , their babies can pick up on that and cry or withdraw , " says Lynne Siqueland , Ph.D. , a child psychologist at the Children 's Center for OCD obsessivecompulsive disorder and Anxiety in Plymouth Meeting , Pennsylvania . As they grow older ( up to about age 10 ) , " kids are more egocentric and often think they 're the cause of a parent 's foul temper , " says Maurice J. Elias , Ph.D. , author of Emotionally Intelligent Parenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomachaches , headaches , and a lack of concentration , or cause them to be clingy or argumentative . " Kids past the age of 10 , he says , grasp that life 's pressures make their parents worry , but they often feel responsible for finding solutions , or they try to swap roles and become caretakers long before their time . Either way , when they sense that their parents are distracted by tension , they become sad and withdrawn . None of which is to say that you should plaster a smile on your face whenever your child is around . " You should n't act like the world is a sunny place where everything always goes well , " says Kate Kelly , author of Living Safe in an Unsafe World : The Complete Guide to Family Preparedness . A better idea , says Kelly : Model effective ( and sane ) ways of managing life 's daily challenges . That 's where our three-step plan comes in . Read on to learn healthy habits that 'll squash your stress and protect your kids from its effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace on the home front . Do end runs around predictable stressors and you 'll make your home a lowstress zone . Here 's how : * Create a " no surprises " policy . Been away from home all day ? Call in on your way home and get a rundown of the day 's events so you can prep yourself . " I call my stay-at-home husband from the road so I know if one of the kids has gotten sick during the day , or if my twin babies need to eat right away , " says Katherine Spring , a managing director at a Chicago public relations firm . " This way I know what I 'm walking into . " * Segue from work to family . At the end of killer workdays , grab a minibreak between your boss 's and your children 's demands with a quick pick-me-up : Get a latte to go , listen to your favorite Sting CD on your way home , or take a fiveminute stroll around the block to decompress before you walk in the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marker on the commute home and use it to shift gears . " When I see a certain fork in the road , I imagine I 'm leaving a concrete jungle and entering an idyllic setting with a path , and that my family 's waiting for me at the end , " says Robert Billingham , Ph.D. , a father of four and professor of human development and family studies at Indiana University at Bloomington . For you , the mental image may be as simple as that of changing from work clothes into jeans . * Plan for your personal rush hours . During less hurried moments , get chores out of the way so you 're less stressed when life speeds up . " Every Sunday night , I put enough snacks in plastic bags to last at least three or four days so I can assemble my kids ' lunches in a flash , " says Rona Novick , Ph.D. , a child psychologist at Schneider Children 's Hospital in New Hyde Park , New York . " If I had to count out pretzels every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give your child what he ca n't get anywhere else : your time . By focusing on your child , you let him know that you value him . The result ? He 'll feel more secure and better able to handle stress-even when you 're the source . And you 'll benefit too : Having that " memory bank " full of time together helps put problems in perspective and reminds you that you 're loved . How to make it happen : * Just hang out . Find a block of time every day when you and your child can read , talk , wash Barbie 's hair in the , sink , whatever-no matter what . " It can be just five or ten minutes , " says Billingham . " It 's better to be realistic and consistent than impractical and disappointing . " And create routines that bring you together . " On most Sundays , our family hikes , bikes , and , if the weather allows , builds snow sculptures , " says Anne Ducey , the mother of three kids aged 11 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way to remember we 're a family . " * Unplug . If you 're , say , waiting in line at the amusement park , turn off anything that rings , beeps , or otherwise connects you to the office or other duties . Similarly , if you work at home or regularly bring paperwork home with you , try to keep it out of the family 's communal area so it does n't distract you . * Get giddy . Tim Gillman , a father of two in Ann Arbor , Michigan , uses the ten-minute wait for the school bus every morning to play I Spy with his 6-yearold and give him piggyback rides . " Fun is a potent antidote for stress , " says Elias . STEP 3 : Show your child how to handle stress . " Have an attitude that says Life has tougher days and easier days , but I 'm a competent person who can handle it , " ' says Novick . And chances are , when your kids are reacting to your stress-or anyone else's-they 'll fall back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : * When the going gets tough , be tough enough to admit it . The computer 's down , Dad 's out of town , and the baby 's sick . Think your kids do n't notice you 're frazzled ? So talk about it , giving just enough details to let them know why you 're stressed and how you 're going to handle your problems . For instance , if a work deadline has made you crabby , consider saying " My boss expects me to have an important paper on his desk tomorrow , and it has to be just right , so I 'm feeling kind of tense . But I 'm going to work on it more tonight , then get up a little earlier in the morning and give it another look , and I 'll be back to normal by tomorrow night . " And encourage your kids to tell you when they feel stressed out . Younger children may have an easier time expressing themselves by drawing pictures . For older kids-who like to keep their emotional lives private-save general questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more likely to open up when you 're not face-to-face . * Be the Answer Lady . When you 're in a jam , come up with proactive alternatives . For example , the next time you and your kids are stuck in traffic and you 're grumbling about how you 'll never get out of this mess , catch yourself and add , " If there 's an accident , we should be moving soon . Otherwise we 'll take the first exit . " * Do n't make " harried " your default mode . When you 're in a rush , it 's natural to , say , tie your child 's shoes for her and half-carry her to the car . But if you make a habit of doing things for her that she can do herself , she may believe you think she 's incapable . Then when you need her to act independently , she may become tense because she thinks she ca n't meet your expectations . The solution : Leave a cushion of time , or just relax and accept that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantra . Debbie Cortigiani , a Basking Ridge , New Jersey , mother of two , repeats , " Serenity now ! " a famously silly Seinfeld line-under her breath when her kids are fumbling around and she 's running late ; it makes her want to laugh instead of scream . * When all else fails and you go nuts , say " I 'm sorry . " " Those two little words limit stress because they let children know up front it 's over , " says Billingham . " It also shows that we all make mistakes and that we can go on from there . And it 's a great way for your kids to see how to treat others when they lose it too .
