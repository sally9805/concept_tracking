His brow creased , Art Shibayama gazes across a wide green field strewn with slabs of concrete . <p> The barracks that housed families like his are gone . So is the barbed wire , and the armed guards . <p> Still , a recent visit to this chunk of flat South Texas land stirs painful memories more than 50 years old . <p> Shibayama recalls the fear and confusion that shook him when , at age 13 , he was whisked from his native Peru , stuck below the deck of a transport ship and dropped at the gates of an internment camp in a country he 'd only heard about . <p> His 2 1/2-year imprisonment made him part of a horrifying , little-known story from World War II : 2,264 Latin American residents of Japanese descent forcibly deported to the United States , primarily to be exchanged for Americans held by Japan . <p> After the war , Peru would n't take most of the deportees back . Shibayama had to fight deportation to war-torn Japan for many years , finally winning the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif . <p> His resentment toward the U.S. government deepened over the years , ultimately leading him back to the place where his freedom was stolen 56 years earlier . <p> He returned to Peru in November as a 70-year-old retired service station owner to be the subject of a documentary on the experience of the Japanese Latin American internees . <p> He came back with hope in his heart - hope of raising awareness about what happened and of spurring Congress to compensate the victims . Time is short ; many already have died . <p> " I 'm here , " Shibayama said softly , the wind kicking up his wispy silver hair , " so the people know what happened - so this kind of thing wo n't happen again . " <p> Shibayama 's father was among the Japanese who began streaming into Peru around 1900 , many drawn by work on sugar plantations . The population swelled to more than 25,000 by 1941 , according to " A Fence Away from Freedom : Japanese Americans and World War II , " by Ellen Levine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and merchants . Shibayama 's father owned a business that made dress shirts . <p> Their prosperity is believed to have fueled racism and contributed to the Peruvian government 's cooperation in the U.S. plan to bring them north . <p> Leading up to the war , Shibayama lived with his parents and five younger siblings in a five-bedroom brick house in Lima , Peru . They had a maid and a chauffeur . He played basketball and baseball and attended private school . <p> Everything changed on March 1 , 1944 . <p> All Shibayama remembers is suddenly being on a ship guarded by soldiers carrying machine guns . They landed in New Orleans and were loaded on a train to Crystal City , 120 miles southwest of San Antonio . <p> The eight-member Shibayama family was given two rooms in a three-room barrack . <p> U.S. federal agents stood guard on towers . <p> Shibayama 's parents put on a brave face . <p> " They tried to act like everything was normal , " he says . <p> Across the western United States , the government was forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spy for the enemy . <p> Meanwhile , the U.S. government urged many Latin American countries to arrest Japanese residents so they could be brought north . Thirteen countries complied ; most of the deportees came from Peru . <p> By many accounts , the United States organized and financed the program with the goal of trading the deportees for U.S. citizens captured by Japanese forces . <p> " The U.S. cited the safety of the Panama Canal as the rationale for this removal , but the use of the Japanese as pawns for exchange was not overlooked , " according to " Confinement and Ethnicity : An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites , " published by the National Park Service in 1999 . <p> The majority were held at the Crystal City Internment Camp , run by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service rather than the War Relocation Authority like other camps . <p> The 290-acre former migrant labor camp was expanded to house 3,500 prisoners , but at one point about 4,000 people were crammed into its cottages and shelters . Most were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> In two prisoner exchanges , in 1942 and 1943 , more than 800 Japanese Latin Americans were sent to Japan , according to the victims ' rights group Campaign for Justice . <p> Most who remained at the war 's end faced an unbelievable bind : Their homelands would n't allow them to return , and yet they were told they could n't stay in the United States . <p> The U.S. government , contending they were illegal immigrants who entered the country without passports or visas , would let them leave the camp only for deportation to Japan . <p> Most went . Some had never even seen their ancestral land before . Years later , some told of living in poverty and going hungry in the devastated country . <p> But 365 Japanese Peruvians , with the help of an attorney who took up the cause , fought deportation , according to " Years of Infamy : The Untold Story of America 's Concentration Camps , " by Michi Nishiura Weglyn . The Crystal City camp stayed open until late 1947 , more than two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Shibayamas , finally escaped by going to work for a frozen-foods processing plant in New Jersey that had used the labor of German POWs during the war . <p> Again , the Shibayama family lived in barracks . <p> " It was just like camp , " said Shibayama , who was then 16 . " Only there were no fences . " <p> The boy who once dreamed of taking over his father 's textile business in Peru spent the next 2 1/2 years laboring over a garden and heaping frozen spinach onto a conveyor belt , often for 12 hours a day . <p> The family then moved to Chicago and applied repeatedly to become legal residents . <p> In 1952 , when Shibayama was 21 , he received a draft notice from the U.S. Army . <p> " Here I 'm fighting deportation , " he says . " If I refuse to go , they might deport me for sure . So I went . " <p> He served for 16 months in Germany and France during the Korean War but was not granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a U.S. citizen and make a life for himself , his wife and two children in San Jose , Shibayama never shook his disdain for the government . <p> His anger grew when he and other Japanese Latin Americans were denied the $20,000 in redress granted to Japanese-American internees in 1988 . The government 's explanation ? The Latin Americans were not citizens or legal residents when they were interned . <p> Ten years later , the government settled a class-action lawsuit by agreeing to pay them $5,000 each . <p> " This was a tragic chapter in the history of our nation , " then-Attorney General Janet Reno said at the time . " It 's time to right this wrong and close the book . " <p> Some , like Shibayama , opted out of the settlement to fight on for equal reparations . <p> " I thought that was like throwing a bone to a dog , " he says . <p> When he met Grace Shimizu , Shibayama knew he had a partner in battle . <p> Reeling from a final letter denying him compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiences of former internees . <p> Shimizu got involved on behalf of her elderly father , a Crystal City internee . In 1991 , she formed the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project in her hometown of El Cerrito , Calif. , and five years later started the nonprofit Campaign for Justice to press Congress for redress . <p> " The money is a symbolic thing , " she says . " This is about getting the U.S. government to acknowledge what happened , and it 's about getting a sincere apology . " <p> Her activism helped inspire the Wartime Parity and Justice Act pending in the U.S. House . The measure by Rep. Xavier Becerra , D-Los Angeles , would provide $20,000 for each victim and an official apology . <p> Becerra 's bill never made it out of the immigration subcommittee last year , but he reintroduced it in February . <p> The legislation also calls for the government to provide $45 million for an educational program about the U.S. internment camps . The money was promised under the 1988 Civil Liberties Act but never rendered . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese Latin Americans just a few years ago . <p> " This is one of the things that smacks you in the face and cries out for a remedy , " he said . " I love this country and I love what we stand for . I do n't think we stand for kidnapping people , holding them hostage and using them as trade bait in exchange for Americans caught by our foreign enemies . " <p> Rep. Ciro Rodriguez , who represents the district that includes Crystal City , vowed to keep pushing the bill despite last year 's failure . <p> " These things sometimes take time , " he said . " But the truth is with us , so I think eventually we 'll be able to pull it off . " <p> First they must repeat the story . <p> Many Americans are aware of the internment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans and immigrants during the war . But the plight of the Japanese Latin Americans is seldom told . <p> Since last year , Shibayama and Shimizu have been holding news conferences to discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary . <p> With independent filmmaker Casey Peek following along with a video camera on his shoulder , Shibayama and Shimizu toured what little remains of the Crystal City camp : an old wooden barrack moved into town and converted into a home , a swimming pool filled in with concrete and overgrown with weeds . <p> Now a senior citizen with a round belly and fine lines sprouting from his eyes , Shibayama stiffened as he read from a granite-block memorial , put up as a reminder " that the injustices and humiliations suffered here as a result of hysteria , racism and discrimination never happen again . " <p> Peek , a community organizer in the San Francisco Bay area , and his colleague , Irum Shiekh , a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley , are producing the film with a $50,000 grant from the state-funded California Civil Liberties Public Education Program . <p> They plan to show it at California universities later this year . <p> " A lot of the community does n't know about the Japanese Latin American experience and the challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program 's director . " We wanted to make sure that story got out to be known to all . " <p> For Shibayama , that 's a big part of it . <p> But not all . <p> " I want the government to admit that they did something wrong , " he said . <p> " That this , " he said , " was a war crime .
