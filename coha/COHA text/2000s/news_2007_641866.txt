<p> With the Kobe Bryant trade talks apparently on hold for now , Bulls general manager John Paxson should turn his attention to Pau Gasol and gauge the chances of making a deal for the Memphis Grizzlies big man . <p> Gasol is n't nearly as talented as Bryant and I ca n't see any scenario in which fans at the United Center would begin chanting his name , but he 'd give the Bulls their first legitimate low-post scorer since Eddy Curry was dealt a little more than two years ago  --  and would come at a much cheaper price than what the Los Angeles Lakers are asking for Bryant . <p> Gasol , 27 , is close in age to other members of the Bulls ' young core , and his addition likely would make them serious contenders to reach the NBA Finals for the next five years or so . He 's exactly what the Bulls need , a big man with a well-rounded offensive game . He can score on a variety of moves in the low post and step out to knock down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points and 9.8 rebounds in 36.2 minutes last season . He shot 53.8 percent from the field and 74.8 percent from the free-throw line . Gasol also would give the Bulls a player capable of drawing fouls and getting easy points from the free-throw line . He had 400 free-throw attempts last season in only 59 games . The only player on the Bulls ' roster to have that many free-throw attempts was Ben Gordon ( 440 )  --  and he played in all 82 games . <p> Gasol is n't a great defender , but he 's big enough to make his presence felt and is a decent rebounder . His pluses far exceed his negatives . <p> Of course , the first thing Paxson has to do is discover if the Grizzlies have any interest in trading Gasol . Paxson talked with the Grizzlies about Gasol before last season 's trading deadline , but it became apparent that they had no interest in making a deal then . <p> Although it 's unlikely the Grizzlies would be willing to pull the trigger on a major deal at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , Memphis has a new general manager ( Chris Wallace ) and coach ( Marc Iavaroni ) , and they might be more receptive to trading Gasol . <p> As solid a player as the 7-foot Spaniard has been during his six years with the franchise , he 's not the type of player who can create interest in a marginal market . If the Grizzlies continue to play before modest crowds at the FedEx Forum , trading Gasol might be the team 's best option from a business standpoint  --  especially considering he makes nearly $14 million this season and has an additional three years for better than $49 million left on his contract . <p> If the Grizzlies get off to a slow start , the chances of the Bulls dealing for Gasol get considerably better . <p> So what would it take to make a deal ? If I 'm Paxson , Luol Deng still is an untouchable and so is Gordon in this scenario . I 'd put together a package built around Tyrus Thomas , a younger , much cheaper player who could spark some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andres Nocioni , another player and a pick might get a deal done under the right circumstances . <p> ROOKIE WATCH <p> LUIS SCOLA <p> Houston Rockets F <p> The power forward from Argentina was a popular pick for Rookie of the Year before the season but has gotten off to a slow start . Entering Friday night 's game against Milwaukee , Scola , 27 , was averaging 3.4 points and 4.6 rebounds in 18 minutes . Spurs guard Manu Ginobili , a fellow Argentine , warns against rushing to judgment on Scola . " He 's got a lot of moves , great ability to score in different ways , " Ginobili said . " Right now is just a learning curve to understand the system , the team , the league , the refs , teammates , opponents . Everything is so new . But he 's a very good player and a smart guy . " <p> BIG NUMBER <p> 15 The quarters it took for Nets starting center Jason Collins to break into the scoring column this season . Collins converted a lefty put-back of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-expecting them to stop the game , give me the game ball , have some balloons and streamers ready for me , " Collins said . <p> THE LAST WORD <p> " We have a rule that has been consistently enforced , and my determination at that time was not to make a special exception for the Suns . It 's something that I ca n't apologize for , but I can understand how people would feel that the enforcement of the rule had consequences . " <p> david stern , NBA commissioner , when asked about the suspensions of Suns players Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw for leaving the bench area during an altercation in last season 's playoffs at a news conference announcing Phoenix as the site for the 2009 All-Star Game <p> FAST BREAKS <p> Holding pattern <p> NBA holdouts are rare , but it appears that Anderson Varejao of the Cavaliers could be sitting out for a while . The team and restricted free agent are no closer to a deal now than they were weeks ( or perhaps even months ) ago . <p> With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , SI.com reported recently that Varejao is willing to accept a one-year deal for the mid-level exception ( $5.3 million ) . The Cavs , though , have no interest in a one-year deal because that would mean Varejao could become an unrestricted free agent next summer . According to Cleveland-area media reports , the team is looking to sign the 6-10 power forward to at least a three-year deal for a little more than $6 million a year . <p> " We have continually conveyed that we value Anderson as a core member of this basketball team , " Cavs general manager Danny Ferry said . " Once he declined the one-year qualifying offer $1.2 million , we thought it was in our short- and long-term interests to extend what is considered a very fair market-value offer to Anderson and try to keep him as a member of this team for several years to come , and we communicated that to him . " <p> New role <p> It appears the Mavericks ' Jason Terry is an early favorite to win the league 's Sixth Man Award this season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas , Terry has shifted to the bench . Heading into Saturday night 's game at Portland , he was averaging 23 points ( second on the team ) and shooting 59.7 percent from the field . <p> " Terry is really playing some good basketball for us , " Mavs coach Avery Johnson said . <p> Terry has gone to the bench without complaint . <p> " It does n't matter to me if I start or come off the bench , " he said . " I just want to win a championship . " <p> Cold Heat <p> After Friday night 's home loss to the Suns , the Heat , the 2006 NBA champ , has dropped a remarkable 18 consecutive games dating back to April . <p> For the record , the Heat lost the last two games of the 2006-07 regular season , was swept by the Bulls in four games in the playoffs , went 0-7 in the preseason last month and has dropped the first five games this season .
