Prologue What does history recognize ? A dish made of a hundred sparrows - a plate of mouths . Fourteen years since her arrest . 1991 . Madame Mao Jiang Ching is seventy-seven years old . She is on the death seat . The only reason the authorities keep postponing the execution is their hope of her repentance . Well , I wo n't surrender . When I was a child my mother used to tell me that I should think of myself as grass - born to be stepped on . But I think of myself as a peacock among hens . I am not being judged fairly . Side by side Mao Tse-tung and I stood , yet he is considered a god while I am a demon . Mao Tse-tung and I were married for thirty- eight years . The number is thirty-eight . I speak to my daughter Nah . I ask her to be my biographer . She is allowed to visit me once a month . She wears a peasant woman 's hairstyle - a wok-lid-cut around the ears - and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly . She does that to hurt my eyes . She was divorced and remarried and now lives in Beijing . She has a son to whom my identity has been a secret . No , Mother . The tone is firm and stubborn . I ca n't describe my disappointment . I have expectations of Nah . Too many perhaps . Maybe that 's what killed her spirit . Am I different from my mother who wanted the best for me by binding my feet ? Nah picks what I dislike and drops what I like . It 's been that way since she saw how her father treated me . How can one not wet one 's shoes when walking along the seashore all the time ? Nah does n't see the whole picture . She does n't know how her father once worshiped me . She ca n't imagine that I was Mao 's sunshine . I do n't blame her . Therewas no trace of that passion left on Mao 's face after he entered the Forbidden City and became a modern emperor . No trace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother tells the daughter that both her father and she hate cowards . The words have no effect . Nah is too beaten . The mother thinks of her as a rotten piece of wood that can never be made into a beautiful piece of furniture . She is so afraid that her voice trembles when she speaks . The mother ca n't recognize any part of herself in the daughter . The mother repeats the ancient story of Cima-Qinhua , the brave girl who saved her mother from a bloody riot . The model of piety . Nah listens but makes no response . Then she cries and says that she is not the mother . Ca n't do the things she does . And should not be requested to perform an impossible task . Ca n't you lift a finger ? the mother yells . It 's my last wish , for heaven 's sake ! Save me , Nah . Any day a bullet will be put into my head . Can you picture it ? Do n't you see that there has been a conspiracy against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your father 's funeral and what he did ? He just brushed fingers with me - did n't even bother to shake my hand . It was as if he questioned that I was Mao 's widow . He was aware of the cameras - he purposely let the journalists catch the scene . And the other one , Marshal Ye Jian-ying . He walked past me wearing an expression as if I had murdered the Chairman myself ! Your father warned me about his comrades . But he did n't do anything to protect me . He could be heartless . His face had a vindictive glow when he made that prediction . He was jealous that I got to go on living . He would have liked to see me buried with him , like the old emperors did with their concubines . One should never have delusions about your father . It took me thirty-eight years to figure out that sly fox . He could never keep his hands away from deception . He could n't survive a day without trickery . I had seen ghosts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The omniscient Mao . Full-of-mice-shit . You are a historian , Nah . You should document my role in the revolution . I want you to demonstrate my sacrifices and contributions . Yes , you can do it . Forget about what your father will think about you . He is dead . I wonder what 's happened to his ghost . I wonder if it rests in its grave . Watch out for his shadow . The hands to strangle me are creeping up fast . I can feel them at my throat . That 's why I am telling you this . I am not afraid of death if I know my spirit will live through the tip of your fountain pen to the lips of the people , generations to come . Tell the world the story of a heroine . If you ca n't print your manuscript in China , take it outside . Do n't let me down . Please . You are not a heroine , Mother ! I hear my daughter fire back . You are a miserable , mad and sick woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father said , you have dug so many graves that you do n't have enough bodies to lay in them ! Their dinner has turned cold . Nah stands up and kicks away her chair . Her elbow accidentally hits the table . A dish falls . Breaks . Pieces of ceramics scatter on the floor . Grease splatters on the mother 's shoe . You have killed me , Nah . Madame Mao suddenly feels short of breath . Her hand grips the edge of the table to prevent herself from falling . Pretend that you never had me , Mother . You ca n't disown your mother ! Well , all my hope is gone . I am exhausted and ready to exit the stage for good . The last curtain time will be tomorrow morning at five- thirty when the guards change shift . They are usually dull at that time . The old guard will be yawning his way out while the new guard yawns his way in . It 's dark outside . A beautiful black night without stars . The prison officials have put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my will . I have saved enough handkerchiefs and socks to make a rope . The rubber walls emit a terrible smell . But all is fine with me now . Tomorrow you will read about me in the news : Madame Mao Jiang Ching committed suicide by hanging . The day to mark is May 14 , 1991 . Am I sad ? Not really . I have lived an extraordinary life . The great moments . . . Now as I think about them for the last time , they still make my heart hammer with excitement . . .
