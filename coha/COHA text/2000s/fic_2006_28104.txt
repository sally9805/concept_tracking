Chapter One THE WESTCHESTER MALL STARBUCKS Monday , March 2nd 10:30 A.M. " Ayyy-men ! " Alicia hooted . " Ayyy-men ! " echoed the others . " Jinx ! " Claire giggled for the first time since she had been expelled . The girls looked at one another , then snickered into their palms . They were wearing what Claire and her best friend , Layne , secretly referred to as " black-tie sweats " - those velvety , two-hundred-dollar tracksuits that Massie described as " casual-cute . " Claire , on the other hand , was " casual casual " in a long-sleeved red tee and the nail-polish-stained Citizens of Humanity jeans she 'd " borrowed " from OCD 's lost and found before Christmas break . " What ? " Her heart started to race . " Do n't you say ' jinx ' here ? Is it a Florida thing ? I could teach it to you . " Massie knit her freshly waxed eyebrows . " Silly rabbit , jinx is for kids . " Everyone snickered again . " Should we tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , whatevs . " Massie shrugged . " Jinx is so second grade , " Alicia explained . " We 're all about apple-C now . " " Oh , okay . " Claire used her **25;849;TOOLONG things- up-for-me tone , hoping they could fast-forward to something that did n't make herfeel like a foreign-exchange student . Kristen sighed . " Apple-C is the keystroke on a Mac that- " " I know . " Claire suddenly got it . " It 's the shortcut for copy , so you say it when someone is copying you . " She would have finished with a duh but if jinx was second grade , duh was probably pre-K . " Moving on . " Massie jiggled the mountain of ice inside her plastic cup . " Here 's to the Pretty Committee and the endless shopportunities that lie ahead . " " To the Pretty Committee and the endless shopportunities that lie ahead . " The girls clinked , then drank . " Apple-C ! " Claire practically shot out of her seat . " That was a toast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't count . " " Oh . " Claire gulped her hot chocolate , accepting the burn on her tongue as punishment for being so stupid . It had been six months since her family moved from Orlando to Westchester . Six months of living on the Blocks ' estate , and six months of proving herself to the Pretty Committee . Finally , Claire was an official member , with an exclusive standing invitation to sleepovers , shopping trips , and five-way calls . But no matter how much fun the girls had together , she would wake up the next morning and need to impress them all over again . It was as if their leave-in conditioners seeped into their hair follicles while they slept and clogged their brains , permanently erasing " cool Claire " from their memories . There had to be something she could do to earn their full-time respect-but what ? The more she tried to figure it out , the more elusive the answer became . " We 're living the American dream ! " Dylan poked her finger though the creamy swirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kristen huffed . " But for me , this is a nightmare . " She slammed her complimentary tap water on the table , ignoring the splash . " I hear ya ! " Claire gushed . " This place is so expensive they should call it Sixbucks . I 'd much rather be in the OCD cafeteria . I 'm over the Westchester . " " Ehmagawd ! " Kristen recoiled . " Seriously ? " Claire stiffened , hating herself for saying the wrong thing-again . How could she have expected them to understand that at the mall she was just the new chick with a bad haircut , an empty wallet , and last year 's jeans ? But at school she was the mysterious outsider who , against all odds , had been accepted into the Pretty Committee . And that made her special . " That was a joke , right ? " Massie looked deep into Claire 's eyes , silently urging her to take it all back . " You do n't really want to be back at OCD , do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge smile . " This ... " She opened her arms and turned to face the mall . " ... is a total fantasy ! " Claire silently thanked her parents for giving her three years of community theater acting lessons . " I would love to share said fantasy . " Kristen sighed . " But I have to do this . " Her biceps twitched as she lifted the black Prada messenger bag the girls had bought her for her twelfth birthday . She turned it upside down and an avalanche of textbooks tumbled out . A History of Western Philosophy , Philosophy Made Simple , Philosophy for Dummies , and The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy were among the titles . Everyone stared . " My mom is forcing me to study philosophy until I 'm back at school , " Kristen explained . " She wants me to figure out the meaning of life so I 'll know exactly what I 'm throwing away . " Her blue eyes began to fill with tears . " Her words , not mine . " " She 's probably mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sumatra to her glossy , light pink mouth . Kristen sniffled . " What was I supposed to do ? Miss out on our first boy-girl field trip because my parents could n't afford it ? Puh-lease ! " " You told them you were going away with your soccer team , then hopped a bus to Lake Placid . " Alicia pinched off a piece of her low-fat blueberry muffin . " And while you were there , you got expelled and lost your scholarship . " " Yeah , I saw that episode , " Kristen hissed . " No need for the recap . " Massie put an arm around her and gave her a loving squeeze . " I thought it was very brave . " " Me too . " Alicia grinned . " Same , " Dylan added . Kristen tugged a chunk of her short blond hair . " Why does it seem like I 'm the only one who got punished ? " " Because you are , " Dylan smirked . " My mom ca n't be mad at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been hooking up with Mr. Myner in Lake Placid , I never would have run away . You guys never would have chased after me , we never would have gotten lost in the woods , and we 'd be napping in science lab right now . " " Well , I got punished . " Claire slouched . " My dad woke me up at six thirty a.m. this morning and made me shower and get dressed , like I was going to school . " The girls made pouty frowns to show how sorry they felt about Claire having been denied her beauty rest . " Then , " she continued , " at exactly seven thirty I had to go out in the cold and stand by the Range Rover for five minutes and act like I was waiting for Isaac to carpool me . " " Seriously ? " Dylan 's green eyes were wide with disbelief . " Yup . And the worst part was ... " Claire pointed to Massie. " ... your bedroom light was still off . " Massie accepted a congratulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Claire leaned forward . " My dad asked Layne to e-mail me our homework . I have to do it all . Every night ! And that 's the only time I can use my computer . Which , by the way , he moved into the kitchen . " Everyone gasped . " But the worst part is , I ca n't ride my bike to Cam 's , and I have n't seen him since Lake Placid . " She paused to count on her fingers . " That was five days ago ! " " He 's a guy . " Alicia tossed her long black hair . " Make him come to you . It 's less pathetic . " Claire ignored the jab . " He 's not allowed . No visitors until I 'm back in school . Not even Layne . " " Well , I can do whatever I want , " Massie smirked . " As long as I prove it 's educational . " " How is shopping educational ? " Kristen asked . " Figuring out my change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kristen rolled her eyes . " If the school board does n't let us back in , my dad 's gon na sue , " Alicia announced . " When are they meeting ? " Claire asked eagerly . " April second . " " They better change their minds . " Kristen ripped her crumpled napkin . " Or I 'm getting home schooled . " " I do n't care if we do n't go back . " Massie glossed her lips with Baby Aspirin-the latest delivery from Gossip Girl . " I want to try boarding school in Switzerland . " " Me too . " Alicia nodded . " Ehmagawd , same ! " Dylan sounded utterly shocked by the coincidence . " Well , I 'll be going to Abner Doubleday Day , " Claire moaned . " Ew ! " Alicia gasped . " Public school ? " Claire nodded slowly . Alicia checked over her shoulder , leaned forward , and whispered , " ADD is full of juvenile delinquents who steal your lunch , then force you to buy it back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the top-again-made Claire shudder twice . " They hate private-school girls there . They think we 're spoiled . " " What do they know ? " Dylan pushed back her cuticles with the corner of her American Express gold card . " Zzzzzzzz , " Massie fake-snored . " Can we puh-lease go shopping now ? " " Given ! " Alicia clapped . " I 'll be here studying . " Kristen moped . " I 'm getting quizzed tonight on Socrates . " " We 'll pick you up on our way out . " Massie reached into her burgundy leather wallet , pulled out a twenty-dollar bill , and tossed it on the table . " For me , the meaning of life is a Frappuccino and a cinnamon biscotti . Study that . " " Thanks ! " Kristen beamed . The girls pushed back from the table and threw their bags over their shoulders . Claire waved goodbye to Kristen , then followed Massie , Alicia , and Dylan into the bright atrium . " Let 's go to Juicy , " Dylan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neiman 's . " " Let 's start at BCBG and we 'll work our way left , " Massie insisted . " Do n't worry , we wo n't miss a single store . " Claire stuffed her hands in her empty pockets and yawned . Her parents did n't need to ground her for getting expelled . Being sentenced to a lifetime at the mall was punishment enough . ( Continues ... )
