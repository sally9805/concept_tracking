<p> NEW YORK  --  This is a tale of two Leos . <p> Actually , this is a tale of two pairs of Leos . <p> The first two Leos are the first films in almost three years from movie star and teen idol Leonardo DiCaprio , who cruised to international superstardom on a blockbuster called Titanic , a film that broke all the records and rules at the box office . <p> The two films are the dark epic Gangs of New York from legendary director Martin Scorsese , which opens everywhere Dec. 20 , and the light and breezy Catch Me If You Can from equally legendary director Steven Spielberg , which opens everywhere just five days later . <p> No movie star in memory has had two such high-profile films open in the span of one week . <p> And then there are the two other Leos . There 's the official Leo , the one who co-stars , filmmakers and friends insist is the real Leo , a serious actor who proved himself in such edgy films as This Boy 's Life and What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination . <p> Then there 's the tabloid Leo , who lives the high life , dates the world 's most beautiful women ( most famously and formerly Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen ) and is referred to as a " legendary hell-raiser " as he carouses with strippers , showgirls and supermodels . <p> At last , DiCaprio , 28 , is ready to talk about all four Leos  --  as well as a certain doomed ship that sent his notoriety soaring as it sank to the bottom of the sea . <p> " Titanic completely transformed my life , " says the lifelong Los Angeles resident , sporting a wispy mustache and goatee . " I would suddenly find myself being chased by four or five different paparazzi in places that I had been driving my whole life or walking in my whole life . Any place that I went , somebody would leak stories about me being there . In retrospect , I probably should have just  --  " <p> DiCaprio stops cold . <p> " I was about to say maybe I should have stayed in my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a kid in my mid-20s and do whatever I wanted to do and have different experiences in life . I do n't regret anything . But it was certainly a learning experience for me . It made me focus more on the decisions that I made as an actor . " <p> But for many Titanic fans , DiCaprio was n't an actor : He was a crush , a pinup boy for a million teenage girls . <p> " What a strange rite of passage he has been forced to go through , " says Daniel Day-Lewis , DiCaprio 's co-star in Gangs of New York . " It 's as if he were born with the advent of Titanic and is now somehow forced to bear a burden for the success of that film . But Titanic bears no relation to the great work that he 'd done some years before that . He 's never given a bad performance that I have seen . " <p> Another Gangs co-star and longtime friend , Cameron Diaz , says she always thought it odd that Leo agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edgier fare . Like DiCaprio , Diaz knows the perils of a pretty face . <p> " People need to put labels on actors to keep them at a level that 's comfortable , " Diaz says . " People get uncomfortable if they think that somebody who is good-looking has talent , too . It has nothing to do with the person they 're judging . But it makes the people who are being judged have to work a little bit harder . " <p> Which , by all accounts , DiCaprio is doing . " In fact , I had to stop him from doing more , " says Scorsese , whose troubled Gangs kept DiCaprio busy on location in Italy for longer than even the marathon Titanic . " I would be saying , ' Come on , let 's move on to another scene . ' " <p> Scorsese says an oft-repeated Italian report that he had to admonish his star in front of the crew because of his late-night carousing was false . " Nobody believes me , but I swear it 's not true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not startle those who have seen him in similarly sympathetic roles in Titanic and the subsequent The Man in the Iron Mask . In Gangs , he plays a dashing , penniless 19th-century orphan who links up with the gang leader ( Day-Lewis ) who killed his Irish immigrant father . <p> The real eye-opener is Catch Me If You Can , in which DiCaprio plays real-life ' 60s con man Frank Abagnale . He not only portrays seductive street kid Abagnale but also all of the roles Abagnale impersonated , including a pilot , a surgeon and a lawyer . <p> And he does it convincingly . <p> " That was in large part thanks to the days that I spent with the real Frank Abagnale , " DiCaprio says . " He understood whatever those hidden mechanisms are that convince people to trust you . " <p> Knowing who is conning you and whom you can trust is essential to anyone who becomes suddenly famous , DiCaprio says . <p> " There are people that come into your life who are better actors than you think , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DiCaprio says grimly . " Considering the number of people that came into my life ( after Titanic ) , I did a pretty good job of fending off a lot of the weirdos . " <p> The good news , DiCaprio says , is that you become even closer to the people you trusted before the explosion of renown . " It got me closer to the people I already knew . " ( One of his famous buddies is Tobey Maguire of Spider-Man fame . ) <p> " Leo loves his grandma and his mom a lot , " Diaz says , giggling at the corniness of her words . " Leo 's the nicest guy ever . " <p> OK , OK . We get it . But what about that wild Las Vegas casino birthday party last month , reportedly featuring scantily clad showgirls and openly smoked pot ? <p> Is n't any of that true ? <p> " There 's a grain of truth in everything , " DiCaprio says . " Once you 're put in the media spotlight , people really exaggerate encounters you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their own agendas , and they want to heighten things to extremes that were n't the reality whatsoever . They want to promote their restaurant , their hotel , their club . " <p> DiCaprio attributes his absence from the screen not to a hedonistic lifestyle , but to travel , to learning about global warming ( he narrates an upcoming PBS special on the topic ) , running his production company and to " being a guy in his mid-20s doing everything else that a normal guy would be doing . " <p> But surely being a sex symbol has its advantages . After all , most of those girls who had Leo posters on their walls are now of age . <p> " I do n't think about stuff like that , " DiCaprio says . " The whole phenomenon that happened after Titanic , with me being splashed all over the media , was truly something that I never sought out . Those girls grow up ; I grow up . And it would just become boring and repetitive for me , as an actor , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses his Titanic leverage to ensure that he works with only the best directors . He has seen great scripts diminished by second-rate directors , and second-rate scripts elevated by great directors , so he figures that watching the director is the smartest way to go . Still , the script had better be good , too . <p> " I do n't want to do a recycled version of something I 've seen a million times before , " DiCaprio says . " What I 'm not excited about is your typical action film . I often wonder , with all the money and all the resources in Hollywood and all the talent that can be tapped into , why ca n't there be a writer out there who can actually weave some intelligence into some of these mundane , ridiculous action movies that I see all the time ? " <p> DiCaprio is even less enamored of contemporary comedies . " If I did a comedy , it would have to be something that was reality-based , because I just do n't think anything else is funny . Slapstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to have some feeling and attachment for the characters to even laugh . I played a cameo in one real comedy , Celebrity . I liked it , because I believe the worlds that Woody Allen creates in his movies . " <p> And if all goes according to plan , the hunky heartthrob hell-raiser Leo someday will be forgotten . <p> " Ten years from now , I want to look back and say that I portrayed a variety of characters in films people still talk about , " he says . " What I do n't want is for people to say that I never took any chances as an actor . Because I think I do . "
