PURPOSE : The purpose of this study was to evaluate an objective measure of knee joint stiffness in older adults with and without knee osteoarthritis . <p> DESIGN : Methodological study of the modified pendulum test . SAMPLE : A convenience sample of community-dwelling older adults ( n=41 ) . <p> METHODS : Knee angle oscillation data were collected with a VICON motion analysis system and were used to calculate stiffness and damping coefficients and measures of joint stiffness . <p> FINDINGS : Although some testing problems were encountered early in the study , useable data were obtained from 29 participants . Within-participant variability for calculated stiffness and damping coefficients was low ( 0.55% and 8.92% , respectively ) , whereas the between-participant variability was high for both the stiffness ( 99.45% ) and damping ( 91.08% ) coefficients . <p> DISCUSSION : The modified pendulum test is a reliable method for evaluation of knee joint stiffness . This method can be used in collection of outcome data for future intervention studies addressing joint stiffness . <p> Nearly 49 million Americans , one out of every tour adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among people older than 65 years of age , symptomatic knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) is the most commonly occurring type of arthritis ( CDC , 2003 ) . OA is a chronic condition involving joint cartilage and bone and soft tissues in the hand , back , hip , and knee . Although providers have long thought of OA as a degenerative , ' wear and tear ' disease , we now know that it is a dynamic metabolic process triggered by numerous biochemical and mechanical insults to the joint ( Felson , 2004 ) . Characteristics of OA include joint pain , tenderness , stiffness , limited movement , crepitus , occasional effusion , and some local inflammation without systemic involvement ( Brandt , Doherty , &; Lohmander , 1998 ) . Although OA-related joint pain has been associated with loss of function and decreased quality of life , there has been very little research regarding the specific influence of OA-related stiffness on functional limitation . One possible reason for the lack of studies addressing this issue is the limited availability of a valid and reliable objective measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely upon self-reported subjective feelings the patient is experiencing . In the absence of an objective measure , they may not be able to clearly identify the outcomes of nursing interventions such as range of motion exercises , the application of heat , alternative treatments such as tai chi or the efficacy of medications used to treat OA . <p> The purpose of this study was to evaluate an objective measure of knee stiffness using the modified pendulum lest in a sample of older adults with and without symptomatic knee OA . This objective measure utilizes knee angle oscillation data to calculate stiffness and damping coefficients using an elementary spring-mass system model . It is thought that these coefficients accurately reflect the severity of stiffness , a clinical sign of OA . The stiffness coefficient represents the mechanical resistance of the joint to movement ( elastic stiffness ) , and the damping coefficient represents the angular velocity-dependent mechanical resistance of the joint to movement ( viscous stiffness ) ( Brandt et al. , 1998 ; Oatis , 1993 ; Oatis , Adonizio , Gillum , &; Kousen , 1995 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restricted joint motion associated with knee stiffness . Background <p> The presence of stiffness , particularly in the morning , is considered to be a distinguishing feature of both OA and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . However , in practice this symptom has been difficult to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively ( Altman , 1991 ; Altman et al. , 1986 ; Hazes , Hayton , &; Silman , 1993 ) . Although the term " morning stiffness " is often used to describe arthritis-related stiffness , both clinicians and people with arthritis recognize that stiffness also occurs at other times of the day following periods of immobilization ( Hazes et al . ) . <p> Subjectively , stiffness is described as a feeling of resistance to movement , slowness in moving the joint in the morning or after staying in one position too long ( Hazes et al. , 1993 ; Helliwell , 1995 ) . The Western Ontario McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) is the most commonly used assessment tool for subjective OA-related stiffness . This disease-specific questionnaire is designed to assess pain , stiffness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell , &; Stitt , 1988 ) . In the WOMAC , stiffness is described as " a sensation of decreased ease in moving your joint " ( Bellamy et al . ) . Participants completing the questionnaire rate the severity of their stiffness " after first awakening in the morning " and " after sitting , lying or resting later in the day " ( Bellamy et al . ) . Although the WOMAC has been used in the evaluation of OA stiffness and in studies to determine treatment efficacy , the test-retest reliability of this measure is low ( 0.41 ) . As a result of the limited reliability of this subscale , stiffness is most often cited as a secondary outcome with pain relief being the primary focus of most interventions . <p> Objectively , stiffness is defined as the measurable resistance to passive motion within a normal range and plane of function ( Haigh , McCabe , Halligan , Blake , 2003 ) . Some of the earliest studies measuring joint stiffness were done with joints in ( he hands of people with RA ( Backlund &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part , 1988 ) . Researchers used a weighted pendulum and arthrograph to measure resistance to passive motion in the second metacarpophalangeal joint in people with RA compared to normal people . They found that elastic stiffness , the resistance due to the lack of elasticity in the joint and surrounding tissues , contributed 90% of the total stillness as opposed to much smaller contributions by viscous stiffness and fractional stiffness ( related to rough or uneven surfaces ) . They also found that increased stiffness was associated with age , RA , and male participants when compared to female participants . Subsequently , researchers refined the technique and tested both knee and hand joints ; however , they were unable to replicate the previous findings ( Helliwell , Howe . &; Wright , 1987 ; Thompson . Wright , &; Dowson , 1978 ) . This discrepancy was attributed to variations in the testing procedures . <p> Today , objective knee joint stiffness can be measured using the Wartenburg modified pendulum test with electronic data collection tools . The pendulum test was first used by Wartenburg ( 1951 ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee as a measure of spasticity in the lower extremities of people with neuromuscular conditions ( Bajd &; Vodovnick , 1984 ; Fowler , Nwigwe , &; Ho , 2000 ; Wartenburg ) . During the original pendulum lest , participants were asked to sit on a table with legs hanging freely . The examiner then raised their relaxed leg to a horizontal position and then released the leg to swing freely . Indications of increased spasticity were noted when there were irregularities in the motion of the swinging leg and a decrease in the number of oscillations ( Wartenburg ) . <p> Subsequently , Wartenburg 's original technique was modified to measure mechanical resistance of the knee and surrounding structures , indicator of stiffness in the knee joint ( Brown et al. , 1988 ; Oatis , 1993 ; Oatis et al. , 1995 ) . The modified version of this test is designed to minimize the amount of resistance from contracting muscles . By using the modified pendulum test and a goniometer for data collection , researchers were able to determine the level of stiffness in a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Later Oatis el al . ( 1995 ) refined the procedure by using a motion analysis system for improved accuracy . A comparison of knee joint stiffness in participants ( 77 = 11 ) with radiological evidence of knee OA and participants with no known pathology ( n = 8 ) revealed a significant difference in objective stiffness ; however , the small sample size suggests the need for further investigation . <p> The modified pendulum test has been used with young adults as well as older adults with knee OA ( Brown et al , , 1988 ; Oatis , 1993 ; Oatis et al. , 1995 ; Ricard , Butterfield , Draper , Schulthies , &; Myrer , 1996 ) . For example , Oatis found this relatively simple test to be a highly reliable ( ICCU &gt; 0.85 ) and valid measure of stiffness when used with healthy young men . Similarly , Ricard el al . used the test for young athletes , and Brown et al . successfully tested older adults . <p> For this study , we used the standardized modified pendulum lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Oatis , 1993 ; Oatis et al. , 1995 ) . Objective measures of stiffness such as the modified pendulum test offer an accurate and reliable measurement of stiffness and have the potential to be useful in the future for determining the efficacy of treatments . Although the electronic device used to collect the data in this study is not readily available to clinicians and is not portable , smaller more portable measurement devices will make this objective test feasible for nurses in the future . Methods Design and Sample <p> This study was designed as a test of the feasibility and reliability of the modified pendulum lest with a beginning convenience sample ( n = 41 ) of both men ( n = 11 ) and women ( n = 30 ) older than 50 years of age with ( n = 29 ) and without ( n = 12 ) a diagnosis of knee OA . Although all participants were tested , useable data were obtained from only 29 of the original 41 participants . These groups were comparable in demographic characteristics ( see Table 1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinics in a rural Midwest community . By posting flyers in the examination rooms instructing interested people to call the researcher , we were able to recruit most of our participants . In addition , 6 participants were recruited after an arthritis presentation provided to a church-based community group . <p> All potential participants were screened using the Mini-Mental Status Exam ( Folstein , Folstein , &; McHugh , 1975 ) . A score of 24 or higher demonstrates that the individual is mentally competent to follow instructions and carry out requested activities . Anyone scoring lower than 24 would have been excluded from the study ; however , no one was excluded for this reason . Other exclusion criteria included the following : ( 1 ) a diagnosis of RA or other rheumatic disease other than OA that can affect the knee ; ( 2 ) any neurological condition that might impair the muscles surrounding the knee , such as stroke or Parkinsons disease ; ( 3 ) a previous knee injury ; and ( 4 ) total joint replacement of the knee . We had one person who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eligible participants were also asked to complete a WOMAC questionnaire . The WOMAC total score ( range 0-96 ) provides information regarding the level of disability being experienced by these participants ( Bellamy et al. , 1988 ) . In the WOMAC lower scores indicate lower levels of disability ( McConnell , Kolopack , &; Davis , 2001 ) . Approximately one third of this sample were asymptomatic for OA , with no disability ( WOMAC scores of 0-10 ) ; one third were mildly affected with limited disability ( WOMAC scores of 1-59 ) ; and one-third were moderately or severely disabled ( WOMAC scores of 60-96 ) . By recruiting participants with all levels of disability , we were able to obtain a wide range of stiffness data . <p> Following informed consent , participants were instructed to come to the Teaching Hospital at College of Veterinary Medicine on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia for testing , where the motion analysis equipment was located . In addition to the modified pendulum test , participants completed the WOMAC ( Bellamy et al. , 1988 ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Short Battery of Physical Performance Tests ( Guralnik et al. , 1994 ) ; however , these results are not reported here . The entire testing procedure took approximately 1 hour to complete . Participants were given a monetary stipend for their participation . Data Collection <p> For data collection , we used the VICON motion analysis system located in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital . This campus building has convenient parking and is easily accessible for older participants . We escorted the participants from the waiting room to a dressing room . In the dressing room , they changed into athletic warm-up pants with snaps on the legs supplied by the researcher . We then escorted them to the testing area and up a gently sloping ramp to the top of the horse treadmill , where the testing table was located . The horse treadmill was used only as a surface on which the table was placed . Participants were asked to sit on a stable table with their legs hanging down . Although the table was sturdy , it was also portable so it could be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidebars were available during the testing process for safety , and our research assistant provided stand-by assistance . At the stall of the session , participants sat with their legs relaxed . By unsnapping the pants only on the leg to be tested , we were able to apply passive reflective markers with the least amount of body exposure . Markers were applied at the lateral epicondyle of the femur ( approximating the knee joint ) , at the lateral malleolus ( approximating the ankle joint ) , and on the lateral side of the greater trochanter ( approximating the hip joint ) . These markers are small spherical devices attached to the skin using double stick tape and elastic wrap . For the participants , the approximate elapsed lime from their first sitting down to the start of the testing was 15 minutes . <p> The modified pendulum test is a performance measure that requires correct positioning of the participant 's leg in a position so that it hangs freely over the edge of the table . The lower leg can then be manually raised and released by the researcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg segment as it relates to the knee joint is best described using an elementary mechanical model ( Meirovitch , 1986 ) ( see Figure 1 ) . The upper leg or thigh is considered to be a stable segment ; therefore , it is supported by an extension on the table placed al 75 angle ( Oatis et al. , 1995 ) . The lower leg and foot represents the displaced segment . Similar to the motion of a pendulum , the lower leg and foot swings through a smaller are with each successive oscillation until the leg and foot return to the original starting position ( see Figure 2 ) . <p> The VICON motion analysis system used in this study to collect data consisted of three high-speed ( 120 H 2 ) cameras , a VICON data station , and a computer ( see Figure 3 ) . As the lower leg oscillated ( swung freely ) , the cameras captured the motion of the markers . These data were then transmitted to the VICON data station and computer for storage and for display in video and graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the relaxed musculature and inert tissue of the knee rather than any active resistance or assistance by the participant ( Oatis , 1993 ) . Results <p> Although we were able to complete testing on all 41 participants , data from 12 participants were not useable . This reduced our actual sample size to 29 participants with useable data . We followed the same testing protocol for each participant ; however , we learned that some participants were unable to remain relaxed throughout the procedure resulting in data that we were not able to use in our calculations . This inability to relax resulted in data we were unable to use from 11 participants . In addition , we experienced problems with the equipment during some of the data collection sessions resulting in loss of data from one participant . <p> During the modified pendulum test it is necessary for participants to remain relaxed so that their leg swings freely when released . For the first few participants , we verbally indicated the beginning of the test by saying ( he word " drop . " Use of this cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to evoke a startle response resulting in some guarding of the limb swing and inadequate data . We then revised our procedure indicating the start of the testing by saying " ready " , then allowing time for the person to relax their leg prior to releasing it to swing . This method was effective in most cases . Other techniques we used included having participants close their eyes , take deep breathes , and think about a pleasant time and place . <p> When we determined that the participant was assisting with the swing or obstructing movement voluntarily , we repeated the trial ( see Figures 4 and 5 ) . For some participants , this led to increased fatigue and anxiety . We tried to complete a minimum number of trials so as to limit participant burden ; however , at limes participants who wanted to do well on the " test " would ask us if they could try again . <p> We also encountered some technical problems with the equipment . The markers had to be within the range of the camera lens with no obstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , we experienced missing data points . Similarly , if the participant or researcher had on reflective jewelry or athletic shoes with reflectors , we found that we had extraneous data points that needed to be removed prior to calculations . When these problems occurred , they were corrected and the trial repealed . <p> Calibration of the motion analysis system is vital to accurate data collection as well . On one occasion , we were not able to adequately calibrate and lost data from several trials on one individual . As with any computer system , there were times when the computer would freeze , and we would have to reboot and recalibrate the equipment . <p> Because of the fact that this testing procedure was quite lengthy ( 1 hour average ) , we worked together in accurate placement of the markers , in determining any problems with visualizing the markers , and in processing the data as quickly as possible . Fortunately , no participants related undue fatigue or pain . <p> We collected several types of oscillation data : frequency , amplitude , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the data from the modified pendulum test , we were able to determine the mechanical resistance of the knee similar to the resistance that exists in a spring that is changing shape . Mechanical resistance has both a displacement-dependent characteristic ( stiffness coefficient ) and a time-dependent characteristic ( damping coefficient ) . These computed values are used by mechanical engineers to describe resistance to motion using the spring-damper model ( Meirovitch , 1986 ) . These coefficients describe the resistance of knee joint to bending and the time-dependent nature of that resistance . <p> The following formulas were used for the calculation : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> where k is the resistance coefficient ( expressed as Nm/rad , Newton meters per radian ) , I is the moment of inertia of the leg-loot segment at its center of mass , and ? is the natural frequency of the oscillation . The moment of inertia for ( he leg-foot segment is obtained through the use of anthropometric measurements from each participant including total body weight and length of the leg-foot segment ( Oatis , 1993 ) . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Newton . meters per radian per second ) and ? is the viscous damping factor calculated using the angular displacement of the knee over time ( Dates , personal communication , January 8 , 2002 ) . We used the Bodybuilder software designed specifically for human motion analysis in the collection of the motion data . We also used MATLAB computer software designed for interactive computation . It is capable of taking the raw VICON data and completing the mathematical computation of the stiffness and damping coefficients . <p> The within-participant variability for the stiffness coefficient had an estimated standard deviation of 0.45 . Using the variance components estimated , we found that the within-participant variance accounted for 0.55% of the variance , whereas the between-participant variance accounted for 99.45% of the variance . This meant that most of the variation in the stiffness coefficients in this sample was between participants rather than among trials . <p> Similarly , the within-participant variability for the damping coefficient had a standard deviation of 0.05 . Once again we used the variance components and found that 8.92% of the variance was within participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damping coefficient was more variable than the stiffness coefficient , but the reliability was still high for both measures . By using the average of three trials for each participant , we did our best to minimize the effect of the within-participant differences in trial data . <p> We administered the WOMAC questionnaire as a screening tool to assure that our participants had a wide range of disability . Following the study , we found that the total WOMAC score was not significantly correlated to the stiffness or damping coefficient ; however , there was a small correlation between the stiffness coefficient and the self-reported stiffness rating as measured by the Stiffness Subscale ( r = 0.36 , p = 0.05 ) using Pearson product-moment correlation . No significant correlation was found between stillness and damping coefficients and a self-reported diagnosis of OA . <p> The privacy of study participants was protected through appropriate data management procedures . We coded all data using a participant number without name or other identifying information . Discussion <p> Knee stiffness is a common symptom among older adults , especially those with OA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , therefore , experience a decrease in their ability to function and in ( heir overall quality of life . Although stiffness is reported by individuals subjectively , the objective measurement of stiffness has been difficult . The modified pendulum test offers a testing technique for stiffness that has the potential to become a valuable tool in the testing of interventions for stiffness . <p> In this study we tested the feasibility and reliability of the modified pendulum testing procedure . Overall , we found that we were able to use this test with people who were mobile enough to climb up on to a high table and allow their leg to be manipulated . The technique also requires that participants remain completely relaxed during the swing period . We found that a majority of our participants were able to relax , thus providing adequate oscillation data as did Brown el al . ( 1988 ) . For people who are severely disabled , especially those who are wheelchair bound , this test would probably not be as feasible . Additional work needs to be done to develop data-gathering techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting . <p> The VICON motion analysis system has been shown to be a reliable and accurate tool for stiffness data collection ; however , it is a large expensive piece of equipment with limited availability for healthcare providers . This poses a problem for future researchers and clinicians who may want to address stiffness in new intervention studies and assess the outcomes of these interventions . The development of smaller , more portable devices for data collection is under way . However , the modified pendulum test is readily available to clinicians as a lest of joint mobility . The next step in this research area is to further refine the technique so that it is more readily available to clinicians . <p> Although there was a small correlation between the screening WOMAC stiffness rating and the stiffness coefficient , the relationship of an individual 's perception of their stiffness and their actual objective joint stiffness remains unclear . Similarly , we did not find a significant correlation between a self-reported diagnosis of stiffness and the stiffness or damping coefficients . This may be due to the fact that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of OA , but many are asymptomatic and/or undiagnosed . Therefore , determination of true disease state is difficult . <p> Knee stiffness continues to impact the lives of millions of Americans with and without OA , especially adults older than 50 years of age . It is vital that stiffness be considered in functional assessment . When taking a nursing history from patients , nurses need to consider limitations in function and the factors that contribute to these limitations . Subsequently , plans of care should address issues such as pain and stiffness that influence physical functioning . Nursing interventions commonly used to combat joint stiffness and pain are range of motion exercises , heat to the joint , joint massage , and appropriate use of pain medication . Until we are able to measure stiffness accurately and consistently , if will be impossible to determine the impact of these interventions objectively . <p> The modified pendulum test offers us an objective method for the measurement of knee joint stiffness . In future , this valuable tool could be useful in measuring stiffness before and after an intervention . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the greatest needs in the field of orthopaedic nursing is the development of tools that can measure the outcomes of our nursing interventions objectively . Orthopaedic nurses are in a unique position to guide the entire research community in the design and testing of interventions to improve physical function and quality of life of older adults .
