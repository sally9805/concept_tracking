<p> Gabriele Mariotti has always had nimble hands , an amazing eye for detail , and a knack for drawing the most out of a fine swath of cloth . <p> But these days , the Italian tailor speaks with hesitation . He has difficulty moving his left hand and shoulder . He needs help climbing the stairs of his home in the Sunset District of San Francisco . <p> In mid-March , a sign was posted on the window of his shop in Mill Valley , announcing its closure due to a family emergency . A stroke had paralyzed the left side of his body . He has since regained some movement , but his body is stiff and his hand feels clumsy . <p> His health had been excellent  --  no history of high blood pressure or high cholesterol  --  but his father and grandfather had strokes . <p> " It 's like a car that runs all the time for years , " he said . " And then one day it does n't work anymore . " <p> Mariotti , 70 , grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s , he moved to the Bay Area and became a success story . For 36 years he has run his small shop , Giovanni of Italy , at the Strawberry Village shopping center  --  serving customers in southern Marin . It was too costly to change the name of the shop when he bought it from another tailor , so many of his customers assume that Giovanni is his first name . <p> " He has beautiful hands . His hands did such wonderful work . . . . He put my daughter through school , " said the tailor 's wife , Ana Maria . " Your hands have to be very precise , like a painter 's . It 's an art , I think . And if you enjoy it , you do it with passion . " <p> She is struggling to pay the bills , including the rent on his shop , while he tries to recuperate with physical therapy . <p> " He 's a very determined man . He loves his trade , " she said , trying to stay calm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a lot of pressure to be in business , and I do n't think he needs that . " <p> The tailor views the shopping center beside Highway 101 as a village  --  a place where he feels at home with shopkeepers . " When I go there , everybody knows me and I know them , " he said . " I like the interaction of the customers  --  good and bad . People come in , they talk about movies . We tell stories . We make a funny . " Some of his customers are from families who have brought clothes to him for three generations . Mariotti loves seeing a high-quality fabric or finely stitched piece of clothing . " Molto bene , " he would whisper and nod . Very well done . <p> He misses the simple things : stopping by the deli for coffee , buying a Lotto ticket at the market , dickering over the price with a customer . <p> " Have you ever known a tailor to die rich ? " he would ask . <p> He was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Beach to buy amaretti . And he would show up at Marin Joe 's restaurant in Corte Madera to sip a glass of wine and banter in Italian with the owner , Romano Della Santina . <p> " He 's a simple guy , very conscientious . A hard worker . He was doing beautiful work and did n't even charge that much , " Della Santina said . " He 's a terrific guy with a lot of talent . I love the guy . " <p> Although frustrated , the tailor has clung to his sense of humor . <p> " He 's the authentic Italian , " his wife said . " No matter how old he is , he 's always looking at girls . He 's very flirtatious with the nurses . They know he just likes to do that for fun . " <p> And he still has a flair for language . His native tongue is Italian , but he also speaks Spanish and English . " The beautiful thing is that he speaks the three languages together at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . He would laugh , too . " <p> One client , Suzanna Schomaker of San Rafael , dropped by his shop with her alterations on the way to her office in San Francisco . Mariotti would n't charge her for quick and easy items like fixing a shoulder strap on a bra . <p> " The very funny thing about him was that he was so hard to understand . His wife would be the interpreter , " Schomaker said . " And they 're so in love . Imagine working with someone 24 hours a day , seven days a week  --  and still acting like they just met . " <p> Mariotti 's wife calls him Amore . They talk mostly in her native tongue : Spanish . <p> He grew up in the village of Loreto Aprutino in the Abruzzo region in central Italy . He was the eldest of three children . His father served in the Italian army in World War II and was taken prisoner in Africa . At age 9 , Gabriele became the man of the house . <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mother made bread to feed the family . Gabriele picked fruit and divided it with his mother , brother and sister . <p> After the war , his father returned home and sent Gabriele to a village tailor , where he served an apprenticeship for eight years . <p> " Tailoring is like an art . You never finish learning , " Mariotti said . " You keep learning from the new styles coming . " <p> At 21 , he moved to Caracas , Venezuela , in search of work and fun . " Going to South America , I felt free , because the customs for men and women are very free , " he said with lust in his eyes . " It 's not like living in a village . " <p> Several years later , he returned to Italy . In 1963 , he boarded a passenger ship for America , landing in New York . He stayed in Baltimore for four months before heading to the Bay Area . <p> He lived in San Mateo and worked for a year for a custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for a year in Belmont , and then briefly as a manager at Macy 's in Palo Alto . <p> Ana Maria grew up in El Salvador . In 1957 , she joined her mother in San Francisco , where she went to school and worked for an insurance firm before snagging a long-term job with Wells Fargo . <p> Mariotti met his future wife at a party in San Francisco in 1969 . " At the time , I was like a butterfly . But I kept looking at her , " he said . <p> " He did n't speak Spanish very well . Just the bad words , " she joked . " I straightened him out . " <p> She took him to the opera , but he was asked to leave because of his snoring . They ate at their favorite restaurant , Fugazzi , and then went dancing . They hiked in the hills and watched sunsets . <p> In 1972 , they were married at her mother 's house in the Sunset District . A year later , they bought a house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have one daughter : Rosanna Maria Mariotti , 26 , a science teacher at San Francisco 's Lincoln High School . <p> " My husband was a very hard-working man . He worked for at least 12 hours a day , " his wife said . " It saddened me that he came home very late . I did n't know that something worse was going to happen . That 's life . " <p> At his shop , Mariotti 's wife handled most of his paperwork and customer relations . " If he was n't satisfied with his work , " she said , " he 'd tell the customers , ' I want to do it over again . Would you mind waiting a few days ? ' " <p> Before his stroke , the tailor used to enjoy walking in Golden Gate Park . He loved to garden and work on his daisies . Once in a while , he would meet with a handful of other Italian tailors in the city . Mariotti used to wear a business suit to work . In recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of wearing a tie each day . <p> " We would have lunch once in a while . He did a lot of work for me , " said customer Henry Timnick . " There 's something about Old World competence . The tailors are gone , and it 's a shame . The last of the great artisans with their hands . " <p> The stroke hit on the morning of March 14 , when Mariotti was at home . The tailor spent the next three weeks at St. Mary 's Medical Center on Stanyan Street , where Dr. Stanley Yarnell presided over his care . <p> " He could n't move his left side . He could n't see . He could n't eat . He was more vegetable than anything , " his wife said . " For a while he could n't even drink liquids . They had him on an IV . . . After a few days , he was beginning to move his hand . It 's a blessing . He could barely speak , but his mind was sharp . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was n't able to have their pieces ready for them . " <p> He was put on a rigorous program of occupational , speech and physical therapy . Medicare and supplemental insurance paid for his hospital stay , but he does not have long-term disability insurance . <p> Two weeks ago , he returned home , where he receives physical therapy four mornings a week . He has been able to start flexing his left hand , but it is not agile . " I can probably do an easy job , but not what I 'm used to , " he said . " To do a fine job , the tailoring is very precise . I need my left hand . " <p> Mariotti insists that he will be back to work in a matter of weeks or months . But his wife does n't know if he will ever work again . <p> " I keep him walking and doing exercises . I keep him engaged in conversation . He 's learning to go up and down the stairs , " she said . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . " <p> When he gets discouraged , Mariotti cuddles Bebe , a stray cat that showed up at the house nine years ago . Bebe 's tigerlike coat reminds him of a cat that was lost in the war when he was a boy . <p> " Each day I feel a little more equilibrium , " Mariotti said after walking across the living room with a cane and his wife 's arm to steady him . " What I could n't do yesterday , I can do tomorrow . " <p> So the shop lights remain off . A couple of potted plants and a small American flag sit in the window . A few unclaimed alterations wait on hangers . <p> " We may have to close the store for a while , and if , God willing he goes back to work , we 'll reopen it . And hopefully the shopping center will have a space for him , " she said . " At least those are his dreams . And I say , ' Yes , that will happen .
