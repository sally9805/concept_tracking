// New England/Canada Maritimes All traces of winter are behind us now . When the ground is warmed to 60 degrees , it 's time to plant out tender seedlings like melons , pepper and eggplant . Fall peas must be in by mid-July ; I plant them between my garlic rows and marvel over the transition from garlic to pea patch when the garlic is harvested several weeks later .

While the garlic is curing , transplant ' Long Keeper ' tomatoes . Keep planting beans and summer squash . In late July , start carrots , beets , radishes , kale , mustard , spinach and turnips . Southern Interior June offers a chance to get ready for the bounty of your summer garden . Mulch any plants that need help beating the summer heat .

Record notes on your spring garden , and get a jump on fall by placing orders for any perennials or bulbs that you will need . Gulf Coast The weather and the harvest are both heating up ; consider sharing your bounty with a local food pantry or homeless shelter . It 's time to seed those crops that demand warm soil , including okra , Southern peas and Malabar spinach . Try sunchokes ( Jerusalem artichokes ) where crops like bush beans have fizzled in the heat .

Many devices , techniques and chemicals have been created to help battle garden enemies , yet the most-effective , single thing we can do to ensure disease-free , bountiful harvests is surprisingly simple : Walk through your gardens every day and carefully inspect the plants .
