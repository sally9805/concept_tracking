Dory Yacobian parks her minivan , pulls out a cell phone and checks on her lasagna . Using her phone to control the oven at home , she adjusts the bake time , plops the handset into her purse and greets her daughter coming out of school . " It alleviates so much stress to be able to walk in the door and have dinner ready and waiting , " she says . " I love this . " <P> Yacobian is one of 20 working mothers in the Boston area currently living with Jetsons-style kitchens as part of a pilot program sponsored by the Internet Home Alliance , a consortium of companies trying to figure out how to make the kitchen of tomorrow a must-have today . The cell phone  --  controlled cooler/oven comboa Whirlpool Polara souped up by IBMis just one component . Each family also has an Icebox FlipScreen ( a TV with a DVD-CD player and Internet access that hangs from a kitchen cabinet ) and a Whirlpool refrigerator equipped with a wireless Web tablet . Everything is networked to the family PC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the Yacobians of Needham , Mass. , this means more fat cables running up from the home office in the basement and a bunch of new network devices around an already cluttered desk . But it also means more home-cooked meals on Dory 's " crazy days , " when she commutes to a part-time job . <P> As I watch the Yacobians experiment with their cutting-edge gear , it 's hard to decide whether I 'm glimpsing the future or just an adventurous family getting the most out of some free toys . They 're certainly having fun with the stuff . Paige , 9 , plays a helicopter-flying game on the Icebox while Stuart , 11 , stands nearby , using the tablet 's browser to start his science homework . Later their mother takes over the Icebox to print
