Chapter One The eleventh day Meehan was in the MCC , the barbers came around to 9 South ; two barbers , a white one for the white inmates , a black one for the rest . Each dragged a chair behind himself , with a guard following , and they set up in opposite triangles of the communal room , which was shaped like a six-pointed star , the cells outside that , in two facing lines in sword hilts sunk into five of the star 's crotches : the exit to the concrete room where the elevators came was at the sixth . So that was another difference from state or county jugs ; no separate room for the barbers to ply their trade . After eleven days , Meehan was thinking he might write a monograph on the subject , was already writing it in his head . Never put anything on paper in stir : that was one of the ten thousand rules . Of course , the primary difference between the Manhattan Correctional Center , which was where bail-less federal prisoners in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waited before and during their trials , was the attitude of the guards . The guards thought the prisoners were animals , of course , as usual , and treated them as such . But in this place the guards thought they themselves were not animals ; that was the difference . You get into a state pen , any state pen in the country-well , any state Meehan had been a guest in , and he felt he could extrapolate-and there was a real sense of everybody being stinking fetid swine shoveled into this shithole together , inmates and staff alike . There was something , Meehan realized , now that he was missing it , strangely comforting about that , about guards who , with every breath they took , with every ooze from their pores , said , " You 're a piece of shit and so am I , so you got no reason to expect anything but the worst from me if you irritate my ass . " These guards here , in the MCC , they buttoned all their shirt buttons . What were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a federal charge before , and he did n't like it . He did n't like how inhuman the feds were , how unemotional , how you could never get around the Book to the man . Never get around the Book . They were like a place where the speed limit 's 55 , and they enforce 55 . Everybody knows you enforce 70 . Shit . From now on , Meehan promised himself , no more federal crimes . And this one was a wuss , this one was so lame . Him and three guys , whose names he would no longer remember , had a little hijack thing , off a truckstop , Interstate 84 , upstate fifty miles north of the city , there was no way to know that truck held registered mail . Not a post office truck , a private carrier , no special notices on it at all . The truck Meehan and his former allies wanted , from the same carrier , was full of computer shit from Mexico . Meehan was n't looking forward to making that plea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how long , here he was in the MCC , downtown Manhattan , convenient to the federal courts , thinking about his monograph on the differences between federal and non-federal pounds . There were a number of ragheads on 9 South , Meehan presumed either terrorists with bombs or assholes who strangled their sisters for fucking around , and they all lined up to get their hair cut by the white barber . Johnson , a white inmate who 'd been friendly and palsy with Meehan since he got here and who Meehan took it for granted was a plant , came over to help him watch the barbering , the two of them seated at one of the plastic tables in the middle of the communal room . " Every time , " Johnson said , " those guys are first in line , get their hairs cut , never does any good . " Meehan , polite , said , " Oh ? " " Their hair grows too fast , " Johnson told him . " It 's something about the sand or something , where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haircut haircut , end of the day they 're back the way they were , they still look like a Chia toy . " " Chia toys take water , " Meehan said . " And sparrows take shit , " Johnson said . What was that supposed to mean ? Meehan watched the piles of curly black oily hair mount up around the raghead in the chair , like they were gon na finish with a Joan of Arc here , and it occurred to him to wonder , as it had never occurred to him to wonder in a state pen , how come barbers were such a total criminal class . Everywhere you went , the barbers were inmates who happened on the outside to be barbers , so this was how they made bad money and good time on the inside , but the question was , how come so many barbers were felons ? And what kind of federal crime can a barber pull ? Maybe what happened , every jail around , whenever a barber was gon na finish his time , the word went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes on the barbers , we need one May 15 . Could be . A guard came into the block . His tan uniform was so neat , he looked like he thought he was in the Pentagon . Maybe he really was in the Pentagon ; who knew ? The guard came over to Meehan : " Lawyer visit . " That was a bit of a surprise . There was n't much Meehan and his lawyer had to say to one another . But any distraction was welcome ; rising , Meehan said , " I 'm with you . " Johnson , friendly and genial , said , " Expecting good news ? " " Maybe I 'm being adopted , " Meehan said . Turned out , he was . ( Continues ... )
