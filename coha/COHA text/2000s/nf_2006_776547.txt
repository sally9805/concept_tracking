SPEARHEADING WEALTH // This book is about the future of wealth , visible and invisible-a revolutionary form of wealth that will redesign our lives , our companies and the world in the years now speeding toward us. // To explain what that means , the pages ahead will deal with everything from family life and jobs to time pressures and the mounting complexity of everyday life . They will grapple with truth , lies , markets and money . They will cast surprising light on the collision of change and anti-change in the world around us-and inside ourselves . // Today 's wealth revolution will unlock countless opportunities and new life trajectories , not only for creative business entrepreneurs but for social , cultural and educational entrepreneurs as well . It will open fresh possibilities for slashing poverty both at home and around the globe . But it will accompany this invitation to a glowing future with a warning : Risks are not merely multiplying but escalating . The future is not for the fainthearted. // Today e-mails and blogs bombard us . EBay makes marketers of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are launched to help cure breast cancer , multiple sclerosis and dozens of different diseases . Other drugs are belatedly pronounced too dangerous and yanked off the market . Robots go to Mars and land with exquisite precision . But computers , software , cell phones and networks constantly fail . Warming warms . Fuel cells beckon . Genes and stem cells trigger bitter controversy . Nano is the new techno-grail. // Simultaneously , criminal street gangs from Los Angeles roam across Central America and build a quasi-army , and thirteen-year-old aspiring terrorists depart France for the Middle East . In London , Prince Harry dresses as a Nazi even as anti-Semitism re-rears its disgusting head . AIDS wipes out a generation in Africa , while strange new diseases in Asia threaten to sweep across the world . // To escape-or at least forget-what appears like chaos , millions turn to television , where " reality TV " fakes reality . Thousands form " flash mobs " and gather to beat one another with pillows . Elsewhere , players of online games pay thousands of dollars in real money for virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castles or maidens . Irreality spreads . // More important , institutions that once lent coherence , order and stability to society-schools , hospitals , families , courts , regulatory agencies , trade unions-flail about in crisis . // And it is against this background that America 's trade deficit soars to unprecedented levels . The national budget staggers drunkenly . The world 's finance ministers wonder out loud if they should risk triggering a global depression by recalling the billions they have lent to Washington . Europe celebrates itself for expanding the European Union-but German unemployment hits a fifty-year high and the French and Dutch overwhelmingly reject the proposed E.U. constitution . Meanwhile , China , we 're told-again and again-is certain to become the next superpower . // The combination of economic high-wire acts and institutional failures leaves individuals back home face-to-face with potentially devastating personal problems . They question if they will ever receive the pensions for which they have worked , or whether they can afford the rocketing costs of gasoline and health care . They agonize about appalling schools . They worry about whether crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How , everyone wants to know , will this seeming chaos affect our wallets ? Will we even have a wallet ? // FAD OF THE MONTH // Not only do ordinary mortals find it hard to answer these questions , so do the experts . Corporate CEOs succeed one another like passengers pushing through a rush-hour turnstile : merging , divesting , kowtowing to the stock market ; pursuing core competence one month , synergy the next , the latest management fad a month later . They study the most recent economic forecasts , but many economists themselves are befuddled as they wander around in a cemetery of dead ideas . // To decode this new world we need to cut through the chatter of rear-window economists and business pundits who prattle about " business fundamentals . " We need to probe below the obsolete obvious . In these pages , therefore , we will focus on the unexplored " deep fundamentals " on which the so-called fundamentals themselves depend . // Once we do , things look different , less crazy , and previously unnoticed opportunities pop out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only part of the story . And chaos itself generates new ideas . // Tomorrow 's economy , for example , will present significant business opportunities in fields like hyper-agriculture , neurostimulation , customized health care , nanoceuticals , bizarre new energy sources , streaming payment systems , smart transportation , flash markets , new forms of education , non-lethal weapons , desktop manufacturing , programmable money , risk management , privacy-invasion sensors that tell us when we 're being observed-indeed , sensors of all kinds-plus a bewildering myriad of other goods , services and experiences . // We ca n't be sure when these will or will not turn profitable or how they will converge . But understanding the deep fundamentals will reveal the existence , even now , of new needs and previously unidentified industries and sectors-a huge " synchronization industry , " for example , and a " loneliness industry . " // To forecast the future of wealth , we also need to look not just at the work we do for money but at the unpaid work all of us also do as " prosumers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock most people to learn just how much unpaid output we all produce every day . ) We 'll look , as well , at the invisible " third job " that many of us hold without even knowing it . // Because prosuming is set to explode , the future of the money economy can no longer be understood , let alone forecast , apart from that of the prosumer economy . The two , in fact , are inseparable . Together they form a wealth system . And once we understand this-and the channels by which the two feed each other-we gain piercing insights into our private lives now and into the future . // LOOSENED CONSTRAINTS // New wealth systems do n't come often , and they do n't travel alone . Each carries with it a new way of life , a civilization . Not just new business structures but new family formats ; new kinds of music and art ; new foods , fashions and standards of physical beauty ; new values ; and new attitudes toward religion and personal freedom-all of which interact with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spearheading just such a new civilization built around a revolutionary way of creating wealth . For better and worse , billions of lives around the world are already being changed by this revolution . Nations and whole regions of the globe are rising or declining as they feel its impact . // Today millions of people around the world dislike or even hate America . Some fanatics wish to incinerate the United States and everyone in it . The reasons they give range from its Middle East policies and its refusal to sign various international treaties to what they regard as its imperial ambitions . // Yet even if peace reigned in the Middle East , even if all the world 's terrorists turned pacifist and democracies flowered like dandelions , the rest of the world would still view the United States with trepidation at best . // This is because the new wealth system the United States is developing , by its very nature , threatens old , embedded financial and political interests around the world . Moreover , in the United States the rise of the new wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women , racial and ethnic minorities , gays and other groups . // Because America 's emergent culture promotes greater individuality , it is seen as a threat to community . Worse yet , because it has loosened some of the traditional sexual , moral , political , religious and lifestyle constraints placed on the individual during earlier economic eras , it is seen as dangerously seducing the young into nihilism , license and decadence . // In short , the combination of revolutionary wealth and the social and cultural changes so far associated with it may have more to do with global anti-Americanism than the usual litany of reasons cited by the media . // The revolutionary wealth system , however , as we 'll see , is no longer an American monopoly . Other nations are racing to catch up . And it is not clear how long the United States will retain its lead . // GUITARS AND ANTI-HEROES // The roots of revolutionary wealth can be traced to 1956-the year when , for the first time , white-collar and service workers outnumbered blue-collar workers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor force was arguably the kickoff point for the transition from an industrial economy based on manual labor to one based on knowledge or mind work . // The knowledge-based wealth system is still called the " new economy " - and for convenience we will at times continue to call it that here-but the first computers , still huge and expensive , actually were migrating from government offices into the business world by the mid-1950s . And Princeton economist Fritz Machlup , as early as 1962 , showed that in the 1950s knowledge production in the United States was already growing faster than the gross national product . // The 1950s are often pictured as a deadly dull decade . But on October 4 , 1957 , Russia launched Sputnik , the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth , triggering a great space race with the United States that radically accelerated the development of systems theory , information science , software programming and training in project-management skills . It also promoted an emphasis on science and mathematics in U.S. schools . All this began pumping new , wealth-relevant knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change as well . Just as the industrial revolution centuries ago brought new ideas , art forms , values and political movements , along with new technology , so did the knowledge economy in the United States . // Thus the 1950s saw the universalization of television and the introduction of Elvis Presley , the Fender Stratocaster electric guitar , and rock ' n ' roll . Hollywood shifted from heroes and happy endings to surly anti-heroes played by actors like James Dean and Marlon Brando . The literary Beats and their hippie followers glorified " doing your own thing " -a precision attack on the conformity valued in industrial mass societies . // The 1960s were marked by Vietnam War protests and the rise of movements for civil rights , gay rights and equality for women . By 1966 the National Organization for Women was pointing out that " today 's technology has . . . virtually eliminated the quality of muscular strength as a criterion for filling most jobs , while intensifying American industry 's need for creative intelligence . " NOW demanded the right of women to participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the economy generally . // While the world 's media focused on these dramatic events , almost no attention was paid to the work of top scientists , funded by the Pentagon , on an obscure new technology called ARPANET-a forerunner of what became the world-changing Internet. // Given this history , the common belief that the " new " economy was the product of a 1990s stock-market bubble , and that it is going to go away , is ridiculous . // GIGGLE NEWS // History records endless examples of " revolutions " that replaced old technologies and even governments without significantly altering society itself and the people in it . By contrast , real revolutions replace institutions as well as technologies . And they do more : They break down and reorganize what social psychologists call the role structure of society . // Today traditional roles are changing at high speed in many countries transitioning to knowledge economies . The roles of husbands and wives . . . parents and children . . . professors and students . . . bosses and workers . . . in-laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as economic implications . At issue are not merely a person 's tasks or functions but the social expectations that come with them . // On and off the job , the result is rising ambiguity , high uncertainty , complexity and conflict as tasks and titles are continuously renegotiated . We see stress and burnout as the roles of doctors and nurse practitioners , lawyers and paralegals , police and community workers are challenged and redefined to a degree not seen since the advent of the industrial revolution . // Revolutions also smash boundaries . Industrial society set a clear border between life at home and life on the job . Today , for the growing millions who work from home , the line is blurred . Even who works for whom is becoming unclear . Robert Reich , former U.S. secretary of labor , points out that a significant part of the labor force consists of independent contractors , free agents and others who work in company A but are actually employees of company B. " In a few years , " says Reich , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what data and who gets what portion of a particular stream of revenues over what period of time . There may be no ' employees ' at all , strictly speaking . " // Academic boundaries are eroding , too . Against enormous resistance , more and more work on the campus is becoming transdisciplinary. // In pop music , borderlines between grime , garage , rock , Eastern , hip-hop , techno , retro , disco , big band , Tejano and a variety of other genres disappear in " fusion " and " hybridization . " Consumers turn into producers by remixing or " sampling " sounds from different bands , different instruments and different vocals into " mash-ups " - the musical equivalent of collages. // On TV in the United States , the once-clear line between news and entertainment is being erased as " giggle anchors " joke between headlines and studio audiences applaud . Advertisers insert their messages and products into the story lines of dramas or sitcoms , thus vaporizing the border between entertainment and marketing . &lt; //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
