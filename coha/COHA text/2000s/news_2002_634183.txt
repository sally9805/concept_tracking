<p> In a church basement recently , a group gathered to decide if 18-year-old Elizabeth Breen should graduate from their school . <p> They did n't measure her knowledge of biology or her grasp of American history . No one required her to spell correctly . In a 10-page " thesis , " Elizabeth only had to explain what she learned about herself at the Chicago Sudbury School and why it was time for her to leave . <p> " When I left traditional school at 15 , although I was fully capable of naming all the provinces in Canada , or demonstrating the Pythagorean theorem , I had almost no social skills and no sense of self-worth , " said Elizabeth , once the top student at her former high school near Joliet . " I walked in damaged and scared of the world and myself , and this environment has been the catalyst for my growth and change . " <p> That , in a nutshell , is what the Sudbury School says it 's all about . Founded on the notion that kids learn best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school on Chicago 's North Side lets students set their own schedules , play when they want and focus on academics only when it suits their fancies . It is one of about 20 private schools worldwide that subscribe to a philosophy developed at the Sudbury Valley School , started in Massachusetts in 1968 . <p> The Chicago school opened in Joliet in 1997 and relocated last year . It has 12 students , ages 8 to 13 , and three alumni , including its newest graduate , Elizabeth . School leaders rent space in a church basement , but hope to find a permanent home and expand to 120 students . <p> " Traditional education thinks , at best , that kids are vessels to be filled . At worst , it thinks kids are lumps of clay to be sculpted , " said Michelle Patzke , one of the school 's founders and staff members . " That worked well in the industrial age , but today we do n't need to be stuffed with information . " <p> So , what then , are these kids learning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several staff members and students gathered around a rectangular table in a small , overheated room in the church basement . <p> " Point of order , " one gum-cracking preteen called out . <p> " I want to give testimony , " another boy said , slouching so low that only his head was visible across the table . <p> A classmate walked in as the slouching boy spoke , Walkman blaring . Another classmate rapped out a beat with makeshift drumsticks on the table . Occasionally , a staff member ( there are no " teachers " at Sudbury ) politely asked the students to lower the music or tone down the drumming . <p> The morning 's session of the school 's judicial committee had begun . Once a day , students and staff meet to investigate infractions of school rules and mete out punishments . Once a week , they take on larger school issues and each student has a say . They weigh in on budgeting decisions . They vote on the firing and hiring of their staff . <p> This day , the group cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Patzke admitted her sin and went to great pains to make sure the kids learned a lesson  --  no one , even the staff , is above the law . <p> " Even though we 're free , " a student , Chaz Colson , 12 , later explained , " we have consequences . " <p> That 's just what Patzke likes to hear . <p> " I do n't think there 's anyone that puts the responsibility on kids the way we do , " she said . <p> The school bills itself as a working democracy , and Sudbury devotees have strong notions of responsibility and choice . The staff does not push kids to read at a certain age , and it does n't require them to memorize multiplication tables . But it does make demands . Students must take responsibility for their actions . Students must think for themselves . <p> Intense and dogmatic , Patzke preaches hard and the kids soak it up . Many sound a lot like Brittanie Ari , a wiry pre-teen who recently left a Chicago public school for Sudbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Brittanie , who came to school around 11 a.m. on a recent day and went straight to one of four computer terminals to send e-mail . " They were teaching me what to think , not how to think . " <p> Patzke helped start the school after taking a hard look at her own formal education  --  which included a University of Chicago Law School degree . She was a success by society 's standards , she decided , but she had never questioned her chosen path . Her disdain for traditional education is palpable . <p> " I was a high-class follower , " said Patzke , who sports a no-frills ' 70s hairstyle and tinted , oversized glasses . " Here the message is , ' It 's your life . What do you want to make of it ? ' " <p> *** <p> Each day , Sudbury 's 12 kids answer that challenge in their own unique ways . <p> While the judicial committee met , a few kids gathered in front of the school 's four computers . One listened to music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent instant e-mail messages to a friend . Later , six students gathered for a meeting of the American Girl club , which had intricate rules , a sign-in sheet and dues  --  a model they picked up in school meetings . <p> School is officially open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. , but students can come and go as they please , so long as they stay at least five hours . Structured classes are available when requested  --  Elizabeth did an acting internship with the Steppenwolf Theatre and Patzke has taught math  --  but they are pretty rare . <p> Only occasionally , students say , do they head to one of the bookshelves that line the cavernous room , and ask a staff member for help with math , history or whatever topic interests them . <p> Because of that , Clara Natkin , a stylish 11-year-old , admits feeling behind other kids in traditional schools . And Chaz says she sometimes misses having homework and winning respect by earning A 's . <p> Even Patzke admits students will have gaps in their education , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you do in life there are gaps , " she said . " What matters is being able to come up with a plan " to deal with the gaps . <p> Despite that rationale , several parents said they have sent their kids to the school with some trepidation . <p> " You have to have skepticism , " said Lawrence Breen , Elizabeth 's father . " We wondered if she was learning , if anyone would accept this education . " <p> It took a year for Elizabeth to persuade her parents to try Sudbury , which costs $5,000 a year . Breen and his wife grew up in traditional schools . He 's an electrician and Kathleen Breen owns a trucking company near Joliet . <p> " I grew up thinking you had to learn these academic things , but I found how sorely wrong I was . These children learn it , but at their own pace , " Lawrence Breen said . " This school gives them the opportunity to explore instead of sitting behind a desk learning what someone else wants them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Elizabeth . Though she took no formal classes , she taught herself enough math to do well on the SAT , earning math and verbal scores in the 80th and 90th percentiles . <p> And graduates of the Massachusetts Sudbury school seem to have options when they graduate . An analysis by a Boston College psychologist found that 50 percent of its graduates went to college , including a few to the country 's most selective schools . Another 25 percent did some post-secondary schooling , including ballet and vocational training . <p> Still , the Sudbury model has not really taken off nationally . Though it has spread , it touches only a minute fraction of the school population . <p> " My take is that most parents wo n't let their kid go anywhere near a Sudbury school , " said Richard Reynolds , an associate professor of education at Eastern Connecticut State , who has visited a Sudbury school in Connecticut . " They like the structure of traditional schools , they like to think of their kids in class , doing grade-appropriate material all day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sudbury education could limit its graduates ' career choices and access to the coveted " American dream . " But for some people , he added , it 's worth the risk . <p> " A lot of us go through life without giving many important issues a second thought , without stopping to think , " Reynolds said . " These are people who say ' I 'm not going to do that . I 'm going to make my own choice . ' "
