After graduating from Utah State University with a wildlife management degree , Bob Wharff went to work for Deseret Land and Livestock Ranch as its wildlife biologist . Then came the cruel winter of 1992-93 . " That winter was so hard on the mule deer I felt I had to do something , " says Wharff . So he volunteered his time with the Mule Deer Foundation and served as the mule deer representative on the board of the then-nascent Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife ( SWF ) of Utah , a grassroots group committed to being the political voice of the state 's hunters and fishermen . Today , the SFW in Utah is a 10,000-member-strong force with a potent reputation . ( Earlier this year , three Utah gubernatorial hopefuls attended a fund-raiser banquet looking for just three minutes of this powerful voting group 's time . ) Wharff decided to duplicate this model in neighboring Wyoming ( he moved to the town of Evanston three years ago ) and is now executive director of the year-old Wyoming SFW . Wharff recognized that Wyoming did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sportsmen at the capitol in Cheyenne . " Most Wyomingites do n't have the chance to get to Cheyenne for meetings , " says Wharff . " The state is too spread out and most folks can not take a day off to go to the capitol . " At the start , a lot of critics labled Wharff as an outsider who was trying to change the state . But over time , he 's made it clear that his group is committed to helping Wyoming sportsmen . In just a year , SFW in Wyoming has grown to 1,500 members and six chapters statewide . His goal is to boost the membership to 15,000 and 12 chapters . " People were misinformed that we were trying to come in here and change things , " says Wharff . " But I think it 's clear that we 're a sportsmen 's group , and you can either get on board and help us get things done , or not .
