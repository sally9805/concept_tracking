The supernova of A.D. 1006 was the brightest in history , and its appearance was noted worldwide . But only now are astronomers figuring out exactly what everyone saw . // BY FRANCIS REDDY // Nearly a thousand years ago , the sudden appearance of the brightest star in history puzzled and frightened sky-watchers around the world . The new star of 1006 was a nearby supernova , the visible display of a star 's complete destruction . At peak brightness , the supernova outshone Venus and even briefly rivaled the Moon . Just how bright it was , however , has been a major puzzle . Modernday brightness estimates range more than three magnitudes , or a factor of fifteen . Recently , however , a team led by Frank Winkler of Vermont 's Middlebury College observed the expanding blast wave and its interaction with the space around it . From this the team found the supernova 's peak brightness , while drawing a convincing picture of how this massive star died . A supernova explosion radiates so much energy - more than 5 billion times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly , the entire galaxy in which it occurs . Such an explosion transforms a star into a shell of hot gas that initially expands at speeds of 6,000 miles ( 10,000 kilometers ) per second or more . The kinetic energy contained in this expanding shell is ten times the energy radiated in the blast . By the time a supernova reaches maximum brightness , about two weeks after the bang , our planetary system would fit inside the shell easily . Stellar debris races into the interstellar environment , creating a shock wave that compresses and heats any gas it plows into . The shock expands for many thousands of years , ultimately affecting a bubble of space more than a thousand lightyears across before it loses its identity in the thin matter drifting between the stars . On May 1 , 1006 , observers around the world noticed a brilliant new star in the constellation Lupus . Historians have found accounts of the event in Egypt , Iraq , Italy , Switzerland , China , and Japan , and additional references may exist in France and Syria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ali ibn Ridwan ( 998-1061 ) , who saw the event as a child of eight . His narrative , based on records by older observers , described the star as " a large circular body , two and a half to three times as large as Venus . " The sky , he wrote , was shining because of its light , while its intensity was " a little more than a quarter that of moonlight . " Ibn Ridwan gave the positions of the Sun , Moon , and planets when the star first appeared , which helped establish the date . He noted that the star disappeared when the Sun came within 60 of its position . That corresponds to a visibility period of about three months . From his site in al-Fustat , now within modern Cairo , the star was above the horizon only during the day by the time it disappeared from sight . Because Venus at its brightest can be seen by day , this suggests the star was fainter than Venus .

JAY SMITH // Astrologers in Europe and Asia also noticed the new star . A significant observation comes from the Benedictine monastery at St. Gallen in Switzerland . Its chronicler noted " a new star of unusual size appeared , glittering in aspect , and dazzling the eyes , causing alarm . . . . It was seen likewise for three months in the inmost limits of the south , beyond all the constellations which are seen in the sky . " To modern astronomers , the implication that the star was just barely above St. Gallen 's mountainous southern horizon helped pinpoint its location . In China , the blazing star raised fears that it portended warfare and ill-fortune . Chinese astrologers watched it for three months before it disappeared into the Sun 's glare , which agrees with other reports . Yet they went further : According to the records , the imperial sky-watchers recovered the star as it emegred from the Sun 's glare in December 1006 and monitored it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supernova 's brilliance , modern astronomers could n't locate the site of the explosion until 1965 , when radio surveys turned up a potential source . It is a bubble of million-degree gas about the apparent diameter of the Full Moon . At radio and X-ray wavelengths , it resembles a ring . This phenomenon , called limb brightening , occurs because our line of sight intersects more hot gas along the shell 's edge than through the middle . Like many shell-type supernova remnants , the ring shows two bright arcs . Astronomers attribute these to asymmetries either in the interstellar environment or in the explosion itself . Photograph ZOOMING IN ON THE FILAMENT that appears brightest in visible light shows clearly where the shock wave , moving outward at more than 6 million miles per hour , is colliding with thin interstellar gas . FRANK WINKLER , MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE/CTIO SHOOTING DEEP IN HYDROGEN LIGHT reveals the supernova remnant 's full extent - a million-degree bubble of gas appearing about as big as the Full Moon . ( Image processing has left artificial patterns around all the bright stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio and X-ray emission comes from the northeast and southwest arcs . In the mid-1990s , instruments on the Roentgen Satellite ( ROSAT ) and the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics ( ASCA ) glimpsed remarkable processes occurring there . Speeding electrons produce a characteristic radiation called synchrotron emission when they spiral through intense magnetic fields , such as those associated with a supernova shock wave . Satellite observations of the bright arcs in the 1006 remnant revealed electrons accelerated to energies of more than 200 trillion electron volts . By comparison , that 's about a billion times the energy of a medical X ray . Such dramatic accelerations support the long-held view that supernova shocks produce the hyper-fast particles known as cosmic rays . At optical wavelengths , however , the remnant looks very different - in fact , it 's hardly there . A few delicate wisps of gas , prominent only in the red light characteristic of hydrogen , occur along the shell 's northwest edge where radio emission is weakest . And that appears to be it . Hoping to dig deeper into why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frank Winkler teamed with Knox Long from the Space Telescope Science Institute to investigate .

Note how the filament has moved outward relative to the stars seen through it . ( This image also can be seen in stereo using red/green glasses . ) FRANK WINKLER , MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE/CTIO/F . REDDY // " Young supernova remnants provide us with an opportunity to learn about an exploded star before its debris becomes hopelessly mixed up with the interstellar medium , " Winkler says . Observations at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory ( CTIO ) in Chile have uncovered additional arcs of gas and a shell of faintly glowing hydrogen surrounding the spot where the star exploded . The shell forms an almost perfect circle , flattened slightly in the northwest where the brightest filaments lie . This is probably where the shock wave is encountering interstellar gas of slightly greater density . Even the remnant 's spectrum looks peculiar . The visible nebulosity of most supernova remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nitrogen , and sulfur , as well as hydrogen . Yet the 1006 remnant glows almost exclusively in the light of hydrogen . In fact , it was only the second such remnant to be identified . ( The first was the remnant from the " new star " studied by Tycho Brahe in 1572 . ) So what 's going on ? Shocks without collisions The first element to understand with the 1006 remnant is the shock wave : a hot soup of electrons and ions and their associated magnetic fields called a plasma . In this plasma , particles rarely collide with each other . Physicists call this situation a " collisionless shock . " The moving shock wave of plasma slams into the electrically charged particles . In a magnetic field , charged particles can move only in spiral paths , so the plasma 's fast-moving magnetic field ensnares and energizes any ions and electrons it encounters .

KNOX LONG , STScl/NASA/CXC // Turbulence may drive particles repeatedly across the shock , pumping up their energy with each passing . Astrophysicists suspect this process , called Fermi acceleration , leads to the creation of high-energy cosmic rays . The second part to comprehending the 1006 remnant is understanding the nature of the interstellar gas outside the shock . It consists primarily of atomic hydrogen at a temperature of about 100 kelvins . This cool neutral gas slips unaffected through the tangled electromagnetic environment at the shock , but once inside , it encounters particles with temperatures of tens of millions of degrees . Collisions with these high-energy electrons and protons ionize the neutral gas and break it apart . When energized by electron strikes , the gas emits well-defined red hydrogen spectral lines . What makes hydrogen-dominated supernova remnants such uninteresting objects at optical wavelengths is the paucity of interstellar matter around them . The region beyond the 1006 remnant may hold as few as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . In the vicinity of bright supernova remnants like the familiar Cygnus Loop , the gas density is at least a thousand times higher . When a supernova shock slams into dense clouds of interstellar gas , it engulfs the gas and triggers a secondary shock that works its way through the cloud . This heats and ionizes the gas , which cools by radiating the energy we see . Filaments of ionized hydrogen can occur only right at the shock front , Winkler notes , " because once the shock wave passes through , the gas no longer emits light . " In fact , most supernova remnants lack any substantial visible component . Thus , the 1006 remnant is actually more typical of supernova debris than the shreds of delicate nebulosity found in the Vela or Cygnus loops . How far ? Looking for correlations , Winkler and Long compared their optical images to radio maps and X-ray data . They found that the remnant 's structural details correspond well across wavelengths , which supports the idea that the strongest emission at all wavelengths stems from shock-accelerated electrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the brightest visible filaments in the northwest part of the ring . Spectral observations indicate the shock is moving at about 1,800 miles ( 2,900 km ) per second - nearly one percent the speed of light - so the distance between the filaments and the X-ray peak shows that neutral gas begins to emit X rays roughly a century after the shock blows through . The key to solving the question of how bright the 1006 supernova was , however , lies in pinning down its distance . Winkler , Long , and Middlebury College undergrad Gaurav Gupta used CCD images collected over eleven years to measure how fast the brightest filaments in the shell are expanding . They found a shift of 280 milliarcseconds per year in those places along the arc where the filaments are well defined . The brightness and duration of the 1006 supernova suggest it was a Type Ia event . These supernovae originate in binary systems , where matter flows from a normal star and accumulates onto a white dwarf companion . The added mass ultimately destabilizes the dwarf , completely destroying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing the rate at which the shell is expanding and its true velocity , Winkler 's group calculated a precise distance . The result - 7,100 light-years - also must be the distance to the exploded star . " By knowing this distance and the standard luminosity of Type Ia supernovae , we can calculate , in retrospect , just how bright the star must have appeared to eleventhcentury observers , " Winkler says . In modern terms , the supernova shone at - 7.5 magnitude , or fifteen times as bright as Venus but much less than the Full Moon 's brightness ( which is - 12.7 magnitude . ) Ali ibn Ridwan compared the new star to both objects . " He 's talking about using Venus and the Full Moon as benchmarks on a scale and is trying to describe where the star appears relative to them , " says Winkler . The early evening sky of midMay 1006 was dominated by these three objects . " It 's taken a long time to interpret what he meant , but now I think we 've finally got it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Affiliation Francis Reddy is a freelance writer and museum exhibit consultant .
