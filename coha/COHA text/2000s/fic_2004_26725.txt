Chapter OneThou shall not stuff pictures of thy husband down the garbage disposal . I made a mental note to add this to my list of personal commandments . I 'd put it right after " Thou shalt not eat more than two pints of ice cream in one night " and just before " Thou shalt never wear the correct size jeans . " Priorities and all . I opened the cabinet under the sink and stared at the root of my problem . My newest commandment was n't a result of sudden regret at the loss of the photos . Instead it came from the fact that by stuffing pictures of the two-timing weasel down the disposal I had caused the sink to clog . Little Kodak bits of my husband 's head floated around the sink 's stainless steel basin . I found an odd sense of peace seeing Kevin Quinn drowning  --  even one-dimensionally  --  but I could n't risk Riley seeing the pieces . I fished them out and shoved them in the trash can . I stared at the stack of prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . It had been taken soon after I met Kevin . I 'd been twenty-one and fresh out of college when Officer Kevin Quinn pulled me over for speeding . Being somewhat desperate  --  since I 'd already gotten two tickets in the previous six months  --  I faked being sick . I still remember with startling clarity the mad dash I 'd made toward the tree line , where I 'd given a fair imitation of that Exorcist girl  --  without the head spinning , of course . Officer Kevin let me off , but later that night showed up at the off-campus apartment I 'd shared with my cousin Ana with a pot of chicken soup . Looking back , I should 've taken the ticket . We looked so disgustingly happy in the picture I was holding . Kevin , the weasel , had n't changed much in the last eight years , at least physically . He was still one sexy piece o ' man . Six foot , three inches . Short , jet-black wavy hair . Clear green eyes . And a smile that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years older than me , a widower with a seven-year-old son and a boatload of baggage , but when he looked at me with those vivid green bedroom eyes , smiled that mischievous smile  --  I 'd never had a prayer of escaping , heart intact . Okay , I admit it . I had n't wanted to  --  until recently . I looked down at my younger , nave self . My mother liked to think all her kids looked like movie stars . According to Mom , my younger sister Maria was the spitting image of Grace Kelly . My older brother Peter ? George Clooney . And amazingly , there was some resemblance in a slightly out-of-focus way . Mom , however , never specified who I looked like  --  she just kept telling me I had a face for the movies . Which left me wondering if I had more in common with that Exorcist girl than just that incident with Kevin . But I did n't think so . Or at least I hoped not . Unlike my sister , I 'd never be movie-star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... pumpernickel . But I 'd never minded . My heart-shaped face had its own unique charm I 've grown fond of during our twentynine years of cohabitation . As I looked at the picture , I realized I had n't changed much since I met Kevin either . My shoulder-length brown hair was still styled in that same nondescript bob . My lips were still too full , my smile too wide . Though they could pass for brown most of the time , my eyes remained a dark muddy green , but nowadays they had tiny lines creasing their corners . Kevin had said I was beautiful . And I 'd believed him . Until two days ago . Sighing , I split the photo in two . Tucking my half into my robe pocket , I dunked Kevin 's half into the full sink , enjoying it almost as much as I would dipping a Krispy Kreme into hot chocolate . As I tried to figure out what to do about the sink full of water , the phone rang . I checked the clock . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge to my voice that was sure to frighten any telemarketers . " Nina ? " Did n't sound like a telemarketer , and although the female voice sounded oddly familiar , I could n't place it . " Yes . " My tone still warned that I was in no mood to buy a time-share in Costa Rica . " It 's Bridget , " she said . " Tim and I got your message and your card . Thank you . " My mouth dropped open . I 'd called and left a message on her machine the other day , but I had n't expected her to call me back . Not for a while , at any rate . Not with all she had going on . I wrapped the phone cord around my finger . " I was so sorry to hear about Joe . " Bridget 's father-in-law , Joe Sandowski  --  " Farmer Joe , " as I used to affectionately call him  --  was found dead in one of his cornfields early last week . Ordinarily the death of a man as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , according to the local paper , there had been something ( which was never specified , and left inquiring minds wanting to know ) found at the scene that indicated his death had been anything but natural . " Thanks , " Bridget said . " We 're sorry too . " An irrepressible sadness tightened my throat . Although I had n't seen Joe Sandowski in years , he 'd played a pivotal role in my life . His love for the outdoors had rubbed off on me to the point where I 'd gone to college for landscape design . Soon after graduating I had opened my own run-of-the-mill landscaping business , which , through a quirky twist of fate , two years ago had morphed into what it was now : Taken by Surprise , Garden Designs . TBS was one of a kind in this area of Ohio , in the country really . We specialized in surprise garden makeovers ... Continues ...
