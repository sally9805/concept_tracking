Mercury has spent the last 25 years in scientific exile . Now , with two new spacecraft in the works , this little planet steps to center stage . Maybe it 's too small , or perhaps it looks just a little too much like the moon . Whatever the reason , minute Mercury rarely enjoys the limelight . Pluto aside , Mercury remains the least-studied and leastappreciated planet in the solar system . Despite its proximity to the sun , Mercury tops very few " Best of ... " lists . It 's not the smallest planet - Pluto wins that contest . Nor is Mercury the hottest - that title goes to neighboring Venus . And it makes the " Top 10 planets in the solar system " list largely because there are slots to spare . At first glance , little distinguishes Mercury from any other rock in the solar system . It bears no icy rings , and no active volcanoes disturb its surface . It 's not a potential abode for life and probably never will be . People have never been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwater - the Gobi Desert of the solar system . To top it off , Mercury proves notoriously difficult to study . Viewed from Earth , Mercury never ventures more than 280 from the sun . This makes it visible to the naked eye only during morning or evening twilight , and then only low in the sky . Professional astronomers have it worse , observing the planet during daylight when it 's higher in the sky . Most operators of large telescopes shudder at the thought of risking million-dollar optics for a fleeting glance at a small , barren rock perilously close to the sun . That 's why the Hubble Space Telescope is forbidden to look at Mercury , lest the eyes of the most famous telescope in history get damaged . Radar offers the safest way to view Mercury , but that gives about the same resolution as Earth-based optical observations of the moon .

A year ago , NASA announced funding for the fullscale development of the MESSENGER probe to Mercury , set to launch in 2004 . Not to be outdone , the European Space Agency plans an even more ambitious mission to the innermost planet late this decade . ( See " BepiColombo : A European Flair , " page 43 . ) Both missions aim to answer some long-standing puzzles about this enigmatic planet . MESSENGER - short for MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry and Ranging - marks NASA 's first return to Mercury since Mariner 10 . That pioneering mission , which flew past the planet a total of three times in 1974 and 1975 , sent back the first glimpses of Mercury 's surface . Yet Mariner 10 photographed less than half the surface , leaving scientists with a desire for more images that has gone largely unsatisfied over the last quarter century . " Much of Mercury has n't even been seen , " says Ralph McNutt , Project Scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is the first time we 'll get high-resolution images of the unseen half . It will be like getting the first good images of the back side of the moon . " In past missions to other solar system objects , photos of the " other half " often revealed exceptional surprises . For instance , the first images of the moon 's far side divulged a surface largely devoid of the dark , lava-filled basins visible on the Earth-facing hemisphere . More striking were the giant volcanoes on Mars , which remained undiscovered until the fourth mission to the Red Planet . " When we 've had other first glances , it is often not representative , " says Clark Chapman , a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado , and member of the MESSENGER science team . " The other half is largely terra incognita . " Even so , Mariner 10 revealed some very odd phenomena . MESSENGER and BepiColombo will visit a world where the temperature difference between night and day can reach over 1100 deg Fahrenheit ( 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some more than a mile high , stretch across the surface , presumably a result of the planet shrinking as it cooled . Giant impacts blasted the pockmarked crust , marring it with craters . The largest of these impacts left the Caloris basin , some 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) in diameter . Mercury 's " year , " which lasts 88 Earth days , is almost exactly 1.5 times as long as its rotation period . Coupled with the planet 's eccentric orbit - it differs from a circle more than any planet besides Pluto - this gives rise to some startling effects . As Mercury passes perihelion , its closest approach to the sun , its orbital speed surpasses its rotational speed . That makes the sun appear to halt its motion in the sky and reverse direction , only to return to its course as the planet slows in its orbit . This phenomenon , known as retrograde motion , is similar to the effect seen as one car passes another on the highway . Even though both vehicles are traveling in the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car appear to move backward momentarily . Photograph The brightest crater an Mercury ( at bottom center ) , measures 25 miles across and is named Kuiper after the famed planetary scientist . // In light of recent discoveries of Jupiter-like planets orbiting close to their parent stars , Mercury 's existence as a dense , rocky world orbiting close to the sun is as important to understand as why our planet is covered with water . It is , as Chapman calls it , an end-member planet , whose very existence brackets the spectrum of planet formation . To understand Mercury , why it is so dense , what it 's made out of , and why it has a magnetic core , is essential to understanding our solar system as a whole , says Chapman . " It is extreme in a bunch of ways , " explains Chapman . " It is at the end of the spectrum in terms of bulk density , it is at the end in terms of distance from the sun , and it is also at the end in terms of temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in science , one often learns from studying the extremes . " And there is still much to learn . " To the uninitiated , " adds Chapman , " it looks a lot like the moon - but it is quite different . " The formation and evolution of Mercury remain almost completely unknown , and the MESSENGER science team believes they may hold the key to understanding planet formation . Mercury represents the ideal physical laboratory . It is like , and yet completely unlike , any of the other terrestrial planets . " As a laboratory , Mercury changes the properties enough to test the generalities of our models " says Sean Solomon , Director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , and Principal Investigator on the MESSENGER mission . But Mercury 's proximity to the sun makes getting there difficult . At a distance of 35 million miles , the sun holds Mercury deep in its gravitational well . The change in velocity needed to get from Earth 's orbit to Mercury 's orbit makes a trip to the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard enough to lift a oneton spacecraft out of Earth 's grip at 6.9 miles per second , but the craft must then accelerate an additional 11 miles per second to match Mercury 's much faster 88-day circuit around the sun .

These plains range from fairly smooth to chock-a-block with craters . Photograph BepiColombo : A European Flair The European Space Agency has big plans for its own mission to Mercury . Under development as a " cornerstone " mission , BepiColombo promises to be one of ESA 's most important long-term planetary projects . Named after Italian mathematician and engineer Giuseppe " Bepi " Colombo , who calculated the Mariner 10 spacecraft 's trajectory , the mission aims to answer many of the same questions as MESSENGER . But it plans to do so in a unique way . Preliminary studies envision sending three separate probes to the planet . The Planetary Orbiter will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments that will examine Mercury from a polar orbit . A smaller Magnetospheric Orbiter will house seven instruments and observe the planet 's magnetic field and its interactions with the solar wind . Finally , a Surface Element will land near one of Mercury 's poles . Its suite of instruments includes a camera , a seismometer , a detector to analyze chemical composition , and a package to measure the temperature , density , hardness , and heat capacity of Mercury 's " soil . " The Surface Element should operate for at least a week and the orbiters for about 12 months . BepiColombo will use a different tack to gain the energy it needs to reach its orbit around Mercury . Although the flight path will take it past both Venus and Mercury for gravity assists , the spacecraft will also use a new ion propulsion system to provide a small but continuous acceleration for many months . A standard chemical propulsion system will ultimately place the spacecraft into orbit , Scheduled for launch in 2009 , the mission will take two-and-a-half years to reach Mercury . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshest craters on Mercury . These rays appear similar to those seen on Earth 's moon . Photograph Mercury 's south polar region displays innumerable craters that chronicle the iron-rich planet 's violent history . NASA , JPL // Until Chen-Wan Yen , at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , figured out how to use gravity assists to get spacecraft to the inner planets , the cost in mass and propellant made getting a probe into orbit around Mercury prohibitive . After the Mariner 10 flybys , NASA shelved further missions to Mercury , in part because the agency did n't know how to get a craft into orbit without using vast amounts of fuel . With their atmospheres to help slow the arrival of incoming spacecraft , Mars and Venus became easier targets . Yen , however , changed all that . Like a sailor on the high seas , she devised a plan to use the natural forces generated by the planets to guide her ships into port . But instead of wind , Yen uses the gravitational energy of other planets to carry spacecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink the spacecraft 's orbit so we can get to Mercury and allow for an easy capture , " says Yen . " MESSENGER is the most challenging because the energy change involved is large and the number of gravity assists one can consider are many . " This time , NASAs orbiter will allow a far more detailed study of the surface , making the added challenge worth the effort . Scheduled for launch in 2004 , MESSENGER will steal energy from Venus and Mercury , making two flybys of each planet , before finally settling into orbit . With each visit , the craft siphons an infinitesimal amount of the planet 's orbital energy to speed it on its way and ultimately maneuver into Mercury 's orbit . This greatly reduces the number and duration of rocket firings , cutting the mass and total cost of the mission . Of course , nothing in life is totally free . What MESSENGER saves in fuel it spends in time - nearly five years ' worth - before reaching orbit in 2009 . " By the time we reach orbit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury mission , " says Solomon . " After Mariner 10 , there was a great deal of interest in a Mercury orbiter , but nobody then knew how to put a craft into orbit around Mercury using conventional propulsion . " Even with all the help along the way , the spacecraft still requires a lot of oldfashioned rocket power . " MESSENGER , for the most part , is a flying fuel tank , " says McNutt . " This is a very massconstrained mission , and it 's a hard mission to do . " But the MESSENGER science team certainly believes it is a mission worth doing . The team hopes to answer some fundamental questions about Mercury 's composition and evolution in an effort to tie together competing theories of how planets form . For one thing , Mercury , although just slightly larger than the moon , is nearly as dense as Earth . Larger planets use gravity to compress their material , which increases their overall density , but Mercury 's small size indicates that the bulk material of the planet must contain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know almost nothing chemically about Mercury except that it is incredibly dense , " says Solomon . " How did it get this way ? " Planetary scientists have concocted a number of theories to explain the high density . If Mercury formed near the sun , only the elements capable of condensing out of the solar nebula at high temperatures , like iron , would have been incorporated into the planet . Or , perhaps the sun 's searing heat burned off the crustal material , leaving only a cinder of iron and nickel . It is even possible that a giant impact knocked off the lighter crust as well-as the underlying mantle , unveiling the metallic core .

" We know the bulk density of Mercury , but as for actual minerals on the surface , we really do n't have a clue , " says Chapman . And those clues are important to understanding the formation of the planet , according to McNutt . " The spectrometers will give us our first good look at the properties of the surface , " he says . " Potentially , there is a rich scientific harvest to come out of this . " The team also hopes MESSENGER will answer other pressing questions about surface materials . In 1991 , radar images showed highly reflective regions deep inside craters near the poles of Mercury . " We want to know what this material is , " says Solomon , " and we are applying a number of remote sensing techniques to find out . ' The top culprit may be surprising : " The best guess is that water ice lurks just inches below the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mercury 's axis tilts exactly 90 to the planet 's orbit around the sun . At the poles , therefore , the sun remains forever on the horizon , and the bottoms of deep polar craters never see sunlight . Ice that collected there , from comet impacts or other sources , would never melt , even on one of the hottest planets in the solar system . Photograph Seeking the Volcanic Plains Bright and colorful may not be words normally associated with Mercury , but it all depends on how you look at it . More than two decades after the Mariner 10 flybys , Mark Robinson of Northwestern University and Paul Lucey of the University of Hawaii reanalyzed the old data to create color maps showing differences in composition across the planet 's surface . The images reveal a dynamic planet that likely once experienced lava flows and explosive volcanic eruptions . Planetary scientists had long suspected that Mercury experienced a volcanic past , though they had no way of knowing for sure . Venus , Earth , the moon , and Mars all have large tracts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon possess large volcanoes . Although black-andwhite images of Mercury revealed smooth plains that appeared similar to the lava-filled lunar maria , looks can be deceiving . Robinson and Lucey 's images , created from Mariner 10 data at two wavelengths , helped make the case . An area near the crater Rudaki ( labeled R in the false-color image ) makes a good example . Suspected lava flows west of ( above ) the crater appear red , which suggests a low amount of titanium . This stands in marked contrast to its surroundings - a key sign that lava flooded the region and buried material of a different composition . A more explosive origin appears likely for material near the Homer basin ( labeled H ) . Robinson and Lucey suspect that a weakness in the crust became a fissure that allowed magma to reach the surface , where it erupted explosively . The boundaries of the blue material to the upper left of the basin appear diffuse ; just what would be expected from such an eruption . - R , T.

The sequence of four planet flybys ( and two firings of the onboard rocket ) will allow the spacecraft to match the innermost planet 's orbital velocity . At both Mercury flybys , MESSENGER will approach the planet near the terminator ( the dividing line between day and night ) and depart from the day side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen by Mariner 10 and help plan observations once the spacecraft achieves orbit . 61 MESSENGER arrives at Mercury for the final time on April 6 , 2009 . The spacecraft will fire its engine once again to achieve orbit around the enigmatic planet . MESSENGER 's science team plans to put the spacecraft into a highly eccentric , 12-hour long orbit that comes within 125 miles of the planet 's surface at closest approach and goes out as far as 9,440 miles . THe mission should last at least one Earth 's year . // Perhaps more important is Mercury 's magnetic field . According to Solomon , the other two small objects in the inner solar system exhibit only weak signs of magnetic activity . The moon once had a magnetic field , and Mars shows evidence of having had one early in its history , but neither object currently possesses a global magnetic field . Mercury , on the other hand , halfway in size between the moon and Mars , has an active and relatively strong magnetic field . Why tiny Mercury should be magnetically active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planetary scientists think that planets require a liquid core to sustain such a field , but the smaller the planet , the faster it cools . Mercury , by all rights , should have a core as cold and dead as the moon 's . Yet the magnetic field persists . According to the science team , this may result from the existence of elements like sulfur that , when mixed with iron , lower the melting point and keep the core molten . Determining the state of Mercury 's core is one of the primary goals of the mission . Mercury 's magnetic field also creates the only other Earth-like magnetosphere in the inner solar system . " Mercury has a miniature Earth 's magnetosphere , " says Solomon . The magnetosphere interacts with the solar wind , creating a physics experiment studied in detail , so far , only on Earth . " The dynamics are very similar to Earth 's magnetosphere , but much faster , " according to Solomon . Mercury should provide an extraordinary physics laboratory . Planetary astronomy aside , it has been a proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mercury in the last century supported the theory , because it explained perturbations in Mercury 's orbit that were unexpected in Newton 's classical theory of gravity . MESSENGER , as the first artificial satellite to orbit this close to the sun , may provide more information . " By simply having a spacecraft that near the sun , we will be learning things relevant to gravitational physics , " says Solomon . After 25 years of neglect , humans are finally rekindling their interest in Mercury . MESSENGER and BepiColombo stand to answer some of the most vexing questions in planetary astronomy . With new planets being discovered around other stars every month , developing a detailed understanding of our own solar system becomes even more important . Mercury , long ignored as the boring sibling in a solar system burgeoning with superstars , is finally drawing attention . The next decade should bring Mercury 's moment in the sun .
