Chapter Nine Fifty-two-year-old Winifred Johnson never entered the lobby of her employer 's apartment building on Park Avenue without feeling intimidated . She had worked with Adam Cauliff for three years , first at Walters and Arsdale , and then she had left with him last fall , when he started his own company . He relied on her from the beginning . Even so , whenever she stopped by his apartment , she could n't help feeling that one day the doorman would instruct her to use the delivery entrance around the corner . She knew that her attitude was the result of her parents ' lifelong resentment over imagined slights . Ever since she could remember , Winifred 's ears had been filled with their plaintive tales of people who had been rude to them : They use their little bit of authority on people like us who ca n't fight back . Expect it , Winifred . That 's the kind of world it is . Her father had gone to his grave railing against all the indignities he had suffered at the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in a nursing home , where complaints of supposed slights and deliberate neglect continued unabated . Winifred thought about her mother as the doorman smilingly opened the door for her . A few years ago it had been possible for her to move her mother to a fancy , new nursing facility , but even that had n't stopped the endless flow of complaints . Happiness  --  even satisfaction  --  did not seem to be possible for her . Winifred had recognized this same trait in herself and felt helpless . Until I smartened up , she told herself with a secret smile . A thin woman , almost frail in appearance , Winifred typically dressed in conservativebusiness suits and limited her jewelry to button earrings and a strand of pearls . Quiet to the point that people often forgot she was even around , she absorbed everything , noticed everything and remembered everything . She had worked for Robert Walters and Len Arsdale from the time she graduated from secretarial school , but in all those years neither man had ever appreciated or even seemed to notice the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about the construction business . Adam Cauliff , however , had picked up on it immediately . He appreciated her ; he understood her true worth . He used to joke with her , saying , " Winifred , a lot of people had better hope you never write your autobiography . " Robert Walters overheard him and became both upset and unpleasant . But then Walters had always bullied her unmercifully ; he never had been nice to her . Let him pay for that , Winifred thought . And he will . Nell never appreciated him . Adam did n't need a wife with a career of her own and a famous grandfather who made so many demands on her that she did n't have enough time for her husband . Sometimes Adam would say , " Winifred , Nell 's busy with the old man again . I do n't want to eat alone . Let 's grab a bite . " He deserved better . Sometimes Adam would tell her about being a kid on a North Dakota farm and going to the library to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better , Winifred , " he 'd joke . " When someone built a three-story house in our town , folks drove twenty miles just to get a look at it . " Other times he would encourage her to talk , and she found herself gossiping with him about people in the construction industry . Then the next morning she would wonder if perhaps she had said too much , her loquaciousness enhanced by the wine Adam kept pouring . But she never really worried ; she trusted Adam  --  they trusted each other  --  and Adam enjoyed her " insider " stories about the building world , tales from her earlier days with Walters and Arsdale . " You mean that sanctimonious old bird was on the take when those bids went out ? " he 'd exclaim , then reassure her when she became flustered about talking so much . And then he 'd promise never , ever to say a word to anyone about what she had told him . She also remembered the night he had said accusingly , " Winifred , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she had told him , yes , even giving the name . And that was when she really began to trust him . She confided that she was taking care of herself . The uniformed clerk at the lobby desk put down the intercom telephone . " You can go right up , Ms. Johnson . Mrs. Cauliff is expecting you . " Adam had asked her to pick up his briefcase and his navy jacket on the way to the meeting today . Being Adam , he had been apologetic about the request . " I left in a hell of a rush this morning and forgot them , " he explained . " I left them on the bed in the guest room . The notes for the meeting are in my briefcase , and I 'll need the jacket if I change my mind and decide to meet Nell at the Four Seasons . " Winifred could sense from his tone that he and Nell must have had a serious misunderstanding , and hearing it only bolstered her certainty that their marriage was heading for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought about the meeting scheduled for later in the day . She was happy that the location for the meeting had been moved to the boat . She loved going out on the water . It seemed romantic , even when the purpose was strictly business . There would be just five of them . In addition to herself , the three associates in the Vandermeer Tower venture  --  Adam , Sam Krause and Peter Lang  --  would be attending . The fifth was Jimmy Ryan , one of Sam 's site foremen . Winifred was n't sure why he 'd been invited except that Jimmy had been pretty moody lately . Maybe they wanted to get to the heart of the problem and sort it out . She knew they all would be concerned about the story that broke in today 's newspapers , although she did n't feel any concern herself . In fact , she was rather impatient about the whole thing . The worst thing that ever happens in these situations , even if they get the goods on you , is you pay a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , and the problem goes away . The elevator opened right onto the apartment foyer , where Nell was waiting for her . Winifred saw the cordial smile of welcome on Nell 's face fade as soon as she stepped forward . " Is something wrong ? " she asked anxiously . Dear God , Nell thought with sudden alarm , why is this happening ? But as she looked at Winifred , she could almost hear the knowledge filtering through her being : Winifred 's journey on this plane is completed .
