Texas Governor George W. Bush always makes reference in his stump speech to a " gap of hope . " It was never quite clear what he was talking about until last week , when he fell into it somewhere between New Hampshire and South Carolina . <P> In defense of the Bourgeois Bubba , it ai n't easy figuring out who you are while you 're under a national microscope and Dad 's golf buddies are wondering what you did with their $68 million . Having initially positioned himself as a centrist and then taken on water , he essentially attacked Arizona Senator John McCain for being  --  a centrist . At this rate of decompression , Bush will be dipping snuff and driving a pickup by week 's end . <P> In contrast , it was a house party last week on McCain 's Straight Talk Express . And if you asked the right people , you found out that as Bush and his brain trust fish for a South Carolina strategy , McCain 's was in place 18 months ago , long before he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham , 44 , a local rising star and one of the few souls who came out of Lewinsky looking better than he did going in . It was Graham , the House Judiciary Committee member and former Air Force prosecutor , who introduced McCain at rallies last week with a terrific down-home twang . And it was Graham whom McCain pointed to every time a desperate Bush tried to tar the Senator as a Clintonian liberal . <P> " They 're going to try to tear him down , " Graham said as we cruised through catfish country . " But they 're going to have to go through me to do it . And I do n't take kindly to Clinton comparisons . " <P> It was July 1998 when Graham got a call from McCain , a man he 'd never met . He 'd heard McCain was considering a run , but as he hoofed it over to the Senate side , he had no idea what was up . <P> " He said he was proud of the way I was handling myself with impeachment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building it around a new dynamic , " says Graham . " Embrace reform , admit that money is a problem in Washington , and put a hero back before the public eye with a Republican name behind it . " <P> McCain knew Bush would be flush early on because of his daddy 's name , so his bargain-basement strategy was to focus on New Hampshire and South Carolina . " If I do this , " McCain told Graham , " I 'm gon na need a guy like you who can help me in South Carolina . " <P> Graham was flattered but not bagged and said he 'd sleep on it . He was no fan of McCain 's failed effort that year to whack tobacco with a gargantuan sin tax . But he liked him well enough to lay out how to win South Carolina : go strong on the military and the restoration of dignity to the White House , hammer away at the Big Money interests in Washington and deliver the same straight message regardless of the polls , the day of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lie to one and you lie to all , Graham says , because cousins call cousins in South Carolina . <P> " He said things I 'd been dying to hear from a leader , " says Graham , who , like McCain , knew the G.O.P. was fat , slow and confused , kind of like Rush Limbaugh in his prime . " Nontraditional Republican things like campaign-finance reform , paying down the debt , Social Security restructuring , not going the way of huge tax cuts . "
