<p> Forty-four years ago , Catholic candidate John F. Kennedy , trying to ease voter worries about a Vatican coup d'etat , insisted that he would not take orders from Rome . <p> Now , some U.S. bishops are taking Roman Catholic politicians to task for not being Catholic enough . <p> The question of how Catholic politicians should balance their faith 's demands and their public responsibilities has taken on new life this year with the presidential candidacy of Democrat John Kerry , a Catholic who backs abortion rights , and a pivotal Senate race in Colorado that includes three Catholic candidates . <p> On Friday , a top Vatican cardinal made it clear that Rome is serious about the issue , suggesting that priests should deny communion to politicians who support abortion rights . <p> In the United States , doctrinally conservative bishops including Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput are attempting to assert moral authority while many Catholics ignore their teachings and feel betrayed by the clergy abuse scandal . <p> On April 14 , a Chaput column in the archdiocesan newspaper suggested that Catholic politicians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> His comments provoked a strong response from Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar , an abortion- <p> rights backer and the Democratic favorite in the Senate race . <p> Salazar , a devout Catholic , said he opposes abortion but does not want to impose his religious morality on others . He also said he does n't think the archbishop should create litmus tests for Catholics . <p> The Republican candidates for Senate , Peter Coors and Bob Schaffer , are Catholics who oppose abortion rights . <p> By week 's end , Salazar and Chaput had not met to discuss the matter , but they likely will soon . Chaput sent Salazar a letter requesting a meeting several weeks ago , said Sergio Gutierrez , the archdiocese 's spokesman . <p> The clash casts light on complex questions : How involved should religious leaders be in politics ? Is abortion a foundational issue that trumps Catholic teaching on capital punishment , Third World debt relief and opposition to the Iraq war ? Do bishops look partisan , namely Republican , by selectively emphasizing church teachings ? <p> ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church on all the issues , ' Chaput told The Denver Post in his first interview since the controversy spawned by his column . ' But the right to life is a foundational one on which the others are built . If you are wrong on this basic , intrinsically evil issue , you are building your house on a false foundation that will crumble . ' <p> Chaput said he was not telling people how to vote , as some have charged , but informing people ' of the gravity of the moral issues that are at stake . ' <p> He said those who have brought up the priest abuse scandal in the wake of his comments are blowing ' dust on the air , ' clouding the abortion question . <p> While Chaput said church leaders should be ashamed for failures during the scandal , he contended that does n't mean the church should be silent now . <p> ' The fact that you 've sinned does n't mean that you ca n't speak about sin , ' he said . ' If people choose not to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's their choice . But the worst thing in the world would be for us to become cowards because we have clay feet . ' <p> Chaput 's colleagues believe the issue needs exploration . The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops created a task force last year to study what steps to take against Catholic politicians who take stands in opposition to church teachings . <p> Options range from barring politicians from holding campaign events at church schools and hospitals to excommunication . It 's not clear whether standards will come before the November election . <p> Kerry , meanwhile , is swept up in what one commentator dubbed ' wafer watch . ' St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke has warned Kerry not to take communion if he attends Mass in the archdiocese . <p> Kerry says he personally opposes abortion but supports the rights of others to have one . He argues that church doctrine allows Catholics the freedom of conscience to choose . <p> Chaput , in another column last week , argued that conscience ' is never just a matter of personal opinion or private preference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church 's ' sacred and certain ' teachings in matters of conscience . <p> The stakes are high : America 's 65 million Catholics represent more than one-fifth of the population . <p> Chaput 's forays into politics are not new . He has written about it for years in his archdiocesan newspaper column and has frequently met with Colorado politicians to press the church 's positions . <p> Gutierrez said the majority of feedback about the latest column has been positive . <p> Other responses , including one from Diana Flahive , founder of Colorado Concerned Catholics , were not . The lay group is affiliated with Voice of the Faithful , which formed in Boston in the wake of the abuse scandal . <p> Flahive argues that politicians who support the death penalty and deny medical help to the poor , for instance , are not being held up to the same bright light of the church . <p> ' If there is a litmus test that we Catholics are supposed to be passing to be considered faithful , I think the church should lay them out clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions , and in the end they can make a list in the newspaper of who is faithful and who is n't , and they can deny the Eucharist to us . I 'm tired of the innuendoes . ' <p> In an interview , Chaput emphasized that his statements about politics are not partisan , and he defended his right to enter the public arena . <p> ' A religion that is not involved in politics from my point of view is n't a religion , because politics is human relationships in the broader society , ' he said . <p> Gutierrez said Chaput believes that the defense of ' innocent human life ' extends to the death penalty , euthanasia and attacks on innocent civilians during war . <p> Chaput was to speak Saturday at a rally at the Capitol against state budget cuts that hurt the poor . <p> But Chaput said he would never vote for a candidate who supports abortion rights , regardless of that candidate 's stand on other issues . <p> ' I do n't trust people who say they are right on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right of the unborn , ' Chaput said . <p> The difficulty for voting Catholics is that neither major U.S. political party meshes seamlessly with church teaching , said the Rev. Tom Reese , editor of the Jesuit magazine America . And not all bishops , he said , agree that abortion should be a litmus-test issue . <p> ' Some would argue that if you 've got a Democrat who will support good health care and child care and welfare for single mothers , that he in fact will reduce the numbers of abortions more than a Republican who talks a lot about being against abortion but never delivers , ' Reese said . <p> By taking a stand now , Catholic bishops are trying to reclaim political ground taken over in recent years by evangelical Protestants , said David Leege , a University of Notre Dame political scientist . <p> ' They are grasping at ways they can provide moral leadership again , ' he said . <p> For Catholic politicians , how their faith squares with their public responsibilities can often feel like a tug-of-war of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Republican , one Democrat , neither marching completely in line with their church . <p> State Sen. John Evans , R-Parker , the assistant Senate majority leader , said he is constantly challenged to stay consistent with the faith ingrained in him . <p> ' If you are going to belong to an organization or be something , you 've got to work at aligning yourself with those values and beliefs , ' Evans said . ' Is it hard ? It is very hard , because the temptation is always there to pull off those things and do the politically correct thing , or maybe the thing that gets you the most votes . ' <p> Evans opposes abortion rights but supports exceptions for rape and incest , a conclusion he reached ' not without a lot of pain and thought . ' The Catholic Church does not believe in any exceptions when it comes to abortion . <p> Evans supports the death penalty but differentiates abortion and capital punishment , arguing that abortion involves the taking of an innocent life . <p> State Sen. Paula Sandoval , D- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she makes decisions based on what 's best for her constituents and the state . <p> She said she , too , struggles with abortion , saying she is neither ' pro-life ' nor ' pro-choice . ' She said she wants more alternatives to abortion for pregnant women , but she is not willing to say the 1973 Roe vs . Wade decision supporting abortion rights should be overturned . <p> Sandoval said she opposed capital punishment when she was younger , but has changed her mind - again , reflecting the people she represents . <p> ' You can say your faith influences you , but in the end , you really have to weigh everything and decide what 's best in the particular situation , ' Sandoval said . <p> Bishops ' attention to Catholic politicians is part of a larger concern in the church hierarchy : that Catholics as a whole are n't as bound to the church . <p> In a study in early 2000 by American Catholics in the Public Square , a quarter of surveyed self- <p> identified Catholics said they relied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 38 percent replied ' somewhat , ' 14 percent said ' not much , ' and 21 percent said ' not at all . ' <p> Other evidence suggests a disconnect between the church and the faithful . Citing opinion polls , the group Catholics for a Free Choice says two-thirds of Catholic voters think abortion should be legal . <p> There are signs the church still can hold sway . In late 2002 , one poll found support for going to war with Iraq dropped by almost 10 percentage points among Catholics after pollsters mentioned the church 's opposition to the war . <p> At the same time , the abuse scandal may have eroded bishops ' credibility to take a stand on moral issues , some observers believe . <p> Christopher Koenigs , a 50-year- <p> old Denver lawyer and a Catholic , suggested as much in a letter to Chaput after the archbishop 's April 14 column , which Koenigs interpreted to be targeting Salazar 's candidacy . <p> ' You are right that power always has moral implications , ' Koenigs wrote . ' Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States have used their power to hide rather than expose the gross misconduct of priests for whom they were responsible . ' <p> In conclusion , Koenigs wrote that he plans to take $ 1,000 he normally gives to the archbishop 's annual fundraising appeal and give it to Salazar 's campaign instead . <p> Eric Gorski can be reached at 303-820-1698 or egorski@denverpost.com.
