" Ginger , you there ! " Even for my mother this was a strange way to start a conversation . The ringing telephone had cut my shower short . I secured the towel wrapped around me . " Where else would I be Monday at eight-thirty in the morning ? " A mere fashion assistant at la Mode magazine , I was supposed to be at work in half an hour . But my boss was my best friend from college , and Sam would n't be in until eleven . " Then why you do n't answer the phone quickly ? I rang and rang ! I worry nobody home ! " My mother was still shouting . I thought I heard traffic in the background-the same rapid-fire honks that were coming in through the open window . Why was she calling from the street ? What was she doing on my street ? I spun toward the window , my wet hair whipping me in the face . There , directly below on the sidewalk , was her black head and bright green Chanel suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did something happen ? Is something wrong ? " " Nothing not wrong in Milwaukee . " " Then what are you doing in New York ? " I asked , somewhat relieved . " I come to fix your life . " I laughed in surprise . " And how are you going to do that ? " " I gon na find you a good Korean husband . " " What ? " I said , not because I did n't hear her but because I could n't believe the inevitable had arrived already . It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Korean mother in possession of a single adult daughter is in want of a professional Korean son-in-law . This maxim is so incontrovertible , this proclivity so genetically hardwired , it was a veritable miracle I 'd made it this far , to my twenty-seventh year , unhitched . " Open the door , " she said . The inevitable was n't my succumbingto her matrimonial wishes-I needed a husband like Gloria Steinem needed a name tag-but my mother 's attempting to fix me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'd fended her off by claiming to be too busy to think about men . Not an entire lie . Though , instead of studying , I was occupied coming up with excuses to give my dissertation adviser , eluding chatty freshmen who wanted to discuss the papers they were writing for me , and cursing the admissions people who believed me when I said in my application that I wanted to be an English professor . I 'd also managed to bat down a bachelor she lobbed at me several months after I left Madison . But now I had no excuse , no protection . Almost a year in Manhattan , fourteen months since I 'd abandoned my dissertation on unpublished subversive female texts , I still did n't have Life Plan B. My job , a stopgap measure , was anything but demanding , and my mother knew that my evenings and weekends were free . I dropped the phone , and tempted though I was not to let her into the building , I held down the button on the wall that would release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk-in closet that passed for my apartment . Boxes of books stood against the wall where the movers had stacked them . The bed was a jumble of pillows and twisted sheets . Clothes , shoes , and magazines carpeted the wood floor and adorned the secondhand couch . Beer bottles , some upright and others on their sides , occupied the kitchen counter like a small army on furlough the morning after . The slovenliness would n't have surprised my mother , but the beer bottles stoppered with cigarette butts would . I did n't have a lot of time . It was a fourth-floor walk-up , and my mother was fifty-nine , but she was in great shape . I grabbed a shopping bag , and with my arm swiped everything on the counter into it . The sound of shattering glass was sort of exhilarating . I was trying to pluck out a plate from the bag , when the phone rang again . " Ginger , you are what apartment ? That why I call in first place . " I gave her the number , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saks bag to the door , down the hallway , and to the garbage chute . I hated contributing perfectly recyclable bottles to a landfill , but apparently , when things came down to the wire , I cared more about saving my butt than the environment . My mother did n't approve of drinking or smoking , and I did n't want to discuss my unladylike behavior . It was better that she continued living in the dark . A policy I generally adhered to . " Mom , did it work ? " I asked into the intercom , wiping the sweat on my brow with the back of my hand . Through the curtainless window , the summer sun was doing its best to make the studio unbearable . " I still wait for the buzzer . " " Huh , that 's strange . I 'll try again . " I 'd managed to turn the fan around so it was blowing the stale air out the window when she knocked . I opened the door wide . She was flushed from the climb up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From her short , puffed-out hair that made her head look disproportionately big to her bone-thin , impeccably dressed body , she was , to my mind , the Korean Nancy Reagan . I took her suitcase from her and reeled backward from the unexpected weight . " I have to go to work , " I said by way of greeting . " I happy to see you too . " She stood on her toes-even with heels on , she was a half-foot shorter than me-and pecked me on the cheek . Regretting my brusqueness , I started to wrap my arms around her , but she shrugged them off . " You wet . " She walked around me and into the apartment . Readjusting my slipping towel , I followed her to the couch but remained standing . I shifted my weight from foot to foot , unsure of what to say or do . I certainly was n't going to bring up the husband thing . Her relentless drive to get me to the altar was mortifying , and her Asian man I wanted to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't know about my discriminatory taste , just as she did n't know about the non-Korean men I 'd mamboed with in the past . ( I did n't dance with them for long-and I made sure they understood I was not long-waltz material . ) I could n't tell her . When my older brother , George , defied her and married a white woman , my mother made me promise she would n't lose me the same way . Granted , I was only fourteen when I made this vow , hardly a legally binding age . But I was all she had . My father left us when I was four . She waved me out of the way . Sitting in an elongated triangle of light coming in from the window , she surveyed the apartment . It was the first time she was seeing it ; I 'd insisted on moving without her help . The sun made her squint and brought out the wrinkles around her eyes . She looked tired , stooped a little , the way she had after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison and temporarily into her house . I 'd been planning on staying longer on campus , treading water until I figured out my next step , but she and the movers appeared at my door the first Saturday after I formally bailed from my program . Slowly , she shook her head and clucked her tongue . " What a dump , " she pronounced . A real estate agent , she was probably thinking of the house I could buy in Milwaukee , paying the same monthly mortgage as I was paying rent . " You can do better . " " Not on my salary . " As it was , she was helping me with the rent , along with food , utilities , and miscellaneous extravagances . Fashion assistants earned well below the median income of college graduates , and perforce lived beyond their means . " No , never on your salary . " She got to her feet and tugged on my cheek . It hurt . " But with doctor salary , yes . " She smiled . Here we go , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good doctor for you , " she said with the bravado of a car salesman . It was the same tone she 'd used pitching the bachelor ten months earlier . Though back then , I had n't been surprised . I 'd known she would spring into action as soon as I left grad school , which was one reason I 'd loitered for as long as I did . That time it was over the phone . " Ginger , I do n't ask you to walk to Ohio , " she 'd cooed . " I pay for plane ticket . Just let him meet you . I buy you new dress . " Meeting me , of course , was to fall in love with me . " He good-looking , he engineer , and he second son . " My father was a first son . " I do n't care about birth order , " I said , stalling for time . Telling her I was feeling too down to meet anyone would have been too unprecedented an admission . She knew , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive spin on things , mustering a cheerful front for her , but she called me weekly , at unpredictable times , catching me hungover , sleeping , or moved by a tampon commercial . As hard as I tried to contain my bewilderment at the lack of achievement in my life , sometimes the truth leaked out . " You do n't care ? You should . First son has to live with parents . You think I only care what he does for living . But Mommy think of everything . " I could imagine her tapping her finger against her head . " That why you should trust me . I get you only the best . " " But he lives in Ohio ! " I blurted out , thankful for the escape clause . Homing in on the fact that her network of Korean acquaintances with eligible sons was limited to the Midwest , I added , " I 'm not going to move . I just got to New York . So what 's the point in meeting him ? " To my astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , and canceled the plane ticket . I thought she relented not out of kindness or fair play , but to give me time to get back on my feet , so I could score an accomplishment , become someone a Korean mother would consider " only the best " to marry her son . I was wrong . Or maybe I was just taking too long , because here she was in my crowded studio . I looked heavenward for succor . " You do n't say something ? " " Like what ? " I asked reluctantly . She shrugged , still smiling . " How about thank you ? " " I have n't even met him . " " So you want to ? " " Let 's discuss this later . I have to get to work . " She frowned . " But your bloom is almost over . " " In the next eight hours ? " As often as I 'd heard that Korean saying , the English translation now stung . I could n't pretend , as I usually did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , I was the oldest assistant in the fashion department by four years . Everyone my age , like Sam , was an editor . " Do n't break up my heart , " she said , furrowing her brow . " You came at a bad time . You should have consulted me first . " " If I do that , you tell me not to come , you busy . " She had a point . " But why did you take such an early flight ? " She wrinkled her nose and twisted her mouth to one side . " I did n't . I came yesterday . " " You did ? Where did you stay ? " As aggravated as I was , I could n't help but feel hurt that she 'd flown all this way and not seen me first . " Mrs. Oh , " she answered . " She moved to New Jersey when you little girl . We always do parknic together . You remember her ? " I nodded . Mrs. Oh talked loudly and laughed a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Ph.D . program . The Ohs had a son . " Is n't their boy 's name Bob ? " My brother and I used to get a kick out of saying his name . Bob Oh . Bah-bo means fool in Korean . My mother vigorously nodded . " Bob . Bobby . That right . He medical doctor now . Lives here . Handsome like his father . " " He 's the good doctor you just mentioned ? " She nodded . She must have recently reconnected with the Ohs ; otherwise she would have tried to set me up with Bob instead of the guy in Ohio . There was nothing like a single daughter to motivate you to hunt down old friends . I shuddered to think how many others she 'd looked up . " I think you wasted your money flying out here . I doubt we 'll like each other . " " Do n't say that . You do n't know . " The summer my father left and my mother started working , I occasionally spent afternoons at the Ohs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when no one else was around , but he was always after my dolls . He also picked his nose . " I know . " She opened her mouth , then closed it , thinking better of whatever she was going to say . Wagging her head , she instead said , " Even so , it not wasted trip . I stay until I get you a husband . " I waited for her to laugh , wink , give some sign she was only joshing . It did n't come . I looked back at her suitcase . She was her own boss at the real estate company ; she could stay indefinitely . I closed my jaw to speak . " How many men do you have lined up ? " She refused to look me in the eye . " Mother ? " " Let 's talk later . Like you said , you got ta go to work . " She put an arm around my waist and bussed me on a spot just below my shoulder-that was where she came up to on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , later . You have to get ready . " She started to push me in the back , steering me toward the bathroom . I tried to resist her , but she was stronger , and then she started to tickle me . She knew all my soft spots .
