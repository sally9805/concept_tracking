Leah <p> Kenny , Stop , Pleeeease ! Kennnnyyy ! " I cried for my life . It was n't even about the baby anymore because I was sure it was dead . There was no way it could have withstood the blows Kenny delivered directly to my stomach . Not to mention his dragging me around on the concrete floors . My poor baby was gone . I was feeling weaker with each punch . I was losing consciousness , and I realized Kenny was trying to kill me . <p> " Please , Kenny , do n't kill me , " I said with what little energy I had . " Please . " <p> Kenny turned me over on my back and straddled my neck and upper chest . He looked in my eyes as I gagged for air . He was blurry to me . In fact , everything was blurry . I turned to my right and the door to one of the guest bedrooms was opened . The furniture in it looked like it was floating . All of the colors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapes on the windows and the multicolored Oriental rugs on the hardwood floors blended together , forming one big rainbow cloud . When I looked up at the recessed lights that lined the ceiling in our hallway , I felt nauseous . I wanted to close my eyes to avoid the dizzy feeling I had , but I was afraid if I did I would die . So I fought with all my might to keep my eyelids from drooping . And just as I was beginning to give up on trying to stay alive , I felt Kenny 's weight lift off me and heard him walking away from me and down the stairs . I felt a sense of relief , as I believed he was finished with me . <p> I had a moment to think about everything I had done to end up in the position I was in , and I wondered if it was worth it . Was it really worth my life ? I wished I could turn back the hands of time , but I could n't , and before I wasted any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I could do to get help . <p> Relief was short-lived . As I lay there on the cold hardwood floor , clinging to consciousness , I could faintly hear Kenny 's footsteps once again on the steps . <p> I opened my eyes as much as my strength would allow and saw Kenny pouring what I figured was gasoline on every step as he walked backward down our spiral staircase . I wanted to protest , to try to plead for my life , but I had no energy at all to do or say anything . I felt completely paralyzed , helpless , as good as dead . <p> " This 'll teach you to wear a wire on me , bitch ! " Kenny yelled . <p> Then I heard the sound of the gasoline can being dropped at the bottom of the steps and , seconds later , a loud poof . A panic came over me . My mind was telling me to get up and run , but my body would n't move . I thought about my mom and how she 'd tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Had I listened to her , I would not have been preparing to meet my death . I thought about Nasir and wondered what he would say and how he would feel once he found out that I was gone . I wished I could have had one last moment with him . Even if it was just to say good-bye . My life nearing its end , I began to muffle the Twenty-third Psalm . <p> " The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters . He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake . Yea , though I walk through the valley of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me . Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over . Surely goodness and mercy shall follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever . " <p> I closed my eyes . I thought about the date : May 30 , 2008 . So my tombstone would read Leah Cecily Nicole Baker , July 17 , 1983 , to May 30 , 2008 . Then I had second thoughts . I 'm not ready to die and especially not like this . I want to fight . I want to fight badly . But I ca n't . Please , God , spare my life . Please , God , intervene . Please do n't let today be my last . <p> Copyright 2009 by Meosha Coleman <br> Continues ...
