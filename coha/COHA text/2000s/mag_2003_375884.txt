Alistair Campbell , Prime Minister Tony Blair 's powerful communications director and the man accused of " sexing up " the British case for going to war in Iraq , did his best last week to defend himself and his boss . He appeared to be smooth and understated at the investigation into the apparent suicide of David Kelly , the former government weapons expert who shared with a BBC reporter his doubts about the government 's case for war , got dragged before parliamentary committees and then took his own life . Campbell had a denial ready for the central question of whether he had influenced the words used in the British claim that Iraq could deploy weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes : " I had no input , output , influence upon them whatsoever at any stage in the process . " But the case is hardly closed . There has been plenty of testimony about meetings , some including the Prime Minister , devoted to the worried search for evidence to harden the case for war . <P> Further roiling speculation was senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with Kelly in February , before the scientist talked to the BBC . Kelly told Broucher that if Britain invaded Iraq , Kelly would " probably be found dead in the woods . " Kelly was upset that he had told Iraqi scientists that there would be no repercussions if they cooperated with the U.N. , and Broucher surmised that Kelly agonized over betraying his contacts . The revelation brought the investigation face to face with Kelly 's pain . The emotional pitch will remain high at least until late this week , when Blair is scheduled to testify .  --  By Helen Gibson
