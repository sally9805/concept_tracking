Chapter One May 2003 Brussels , Belgium In one of his trademark conservative suits , Gino Malko strolled through the rue Sante-Catherine area in the heart of the lower city , enjoying the cool sunlight of the northern spring as he swung his special ebony cane with the silver handle . From time to time , he threw back his head , shut his eyes , and let the sun warm his face , somehow avoiding the other walkers as if he had built-in radar . Eventually , he turned into a caf , Le Cerf Agile , and sat at an outdoor table covered in white lace . The eager waiter bustled over . " Good morning again , monsieur . Another fine day , eh ? " he asked in English . " Your usual ? " " Thank you , Ruud , " Malko said , smiling , playing his role . Malko was a heavy tipper , so the waiter returned quickly with caf au lair and a Belgian pastry . Malko nodded his appreciation , poured from the two silver pitchers , stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his ease to watch the passing throng of locals , NATO personnel , businessmen , tourists , and EU staff members . It was early for tourists , but the fine spring weather had attracted a swarm . He was on his second pastry when he spotted the target . He casually picked up his cane and moved naturally into the stream of pedestrians . Apparently , the density of the crowd forced him to hold the cane upright . In the normal course of things , he bumped into one or two people , including his target , expressed his horrified regrets each time , and finally , as if the crush were too much , turned back toward the caf . A woman screamed . Everyone looked in her direction . Near her , a tall , slender man with a Mediterranean complexion had collapsed on the sidewalk , his hand clutching his chest . As Brussels ' thick traffic surged past , people converged . They shouted in French , Flemish , and English . " Give him air ! " " Call the paramedics ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor-stand aside ! " Now back at his table at the caf , Malko sipped coffee and chewed his pastry and watched as the doctor dove into the riveted throng . The spectators whispered into one another 's ears and peered down . As Malko finished his pastry and dusted his fingers , a shiver of horror swept around the circle . Almost immediately , a man in shirtsleeves fought his way out , dialing a cell . His face was pink with excitement . " There 's been a tragedy on the street in the rue Sante-Catherine district ! " he reported in French . " Heart attack-a doctor just said so . What ? Yes , he 's dead . Important ? Hold your hat : It 's EU Competition Commissioner Franco Peri ! Get it on the air at once . Yes , the lead . Pull whatever else you have off ! " Gino Malko smiled , left euros on the lace-covered table , and headed off , cane swinging . He would be back in his hotel in five minutes . Checked out in ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 2003 The University of California Santa Barbara It was after nine o'clock in the morning , and Campbell Hall was crammed with students sitting in row after row , rising toward the back of the amphitheater . Liz Sansborough studied them as she gave her last lecture of the summer term . There was something about their indifferent , interested , scrubbed , dirty , sleepy , alert faces that radiated hope . They reminded her of her years at Cambridge , when she was their age and searching for a clue , too . She would probably continue to search until she keeled over from work and the occasional but necessary martini . The fact that they showed up class after class made her optimistic that they would not quit the hunt either . " Marx claimed violence was the midwife of history , " she told them . " But fascism was n't created by an aristocracy any more than communism was by a peasantry . Both were the result of political ideologues , from Trotsky and Lenin to Hitler and Mussolini , and each political system was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' overkill ' out of ideological intoxication-a substitute religion , if you will-to create a new world and a new human . In the cases of Stalin and Hitler , they used terrorism and violence not only against other armies but against civilians , including their own , just as dictators do today . Saddam Hussein , Osama bin Laden , the Taliban , and the al-Qaeda network are modern examples . " She paused to let the summary sink in , then smiled . " All right , now it 's your turn . Where do you think all of this fits in with what we 've been talking about in terms of the psychology of violence ? " She watched their feet shuffle and their gazes lower . The hands of the usual suspects shot up , but she wanted someone else to show some mettle . " Come on , brave-hearted souls , " she coaxed . " Who wants to take a wild stab ? " A few more hands rose . " All right , you look as if you 'll have something interesting to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating chart for such a large lecture class , and although she recognized the twentysomething , she was unsure of her name . The young woman had a sheet of pale blond hair that hung straight , masking half her face . She tossed her head to free her eyes and mouth , perhaps even to breathe . She said earnestly , " Adult aggression and violence can stem from early-childhood experience , Professor Sansborough , but that 's not always the complete explanation . " " Go on . " " In fact , that explanation could be construed as too easy , " she said , gaining confidence . " A cheap shot . ' Good ' people sometimes get seduced into violence by situational forces . They ... they get caught up in a violent moment , and their real selves sort of get lost . " She stopped , groping for more . Liz nodded . " In other words , their personal identities get suspended in a kind of moral disengagement . They use justification and interpretation to legitimatize their actions . Ergo , the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and how an average person can wind up doing something despicable and violent and evil that they 'll never forget and may never be able to forgive themselves for .... " For Liz , the rest of the lecture sped past . When it was over , she was feeling wired . She gathered her notes and stuffed them into her briefcase . She was not supposed to have taught today . In fact , she should be in Paris right now , taking some vacation time with Sarah and Asher . But in the end , she had been unable to make herself leave this final lecture of the summer session to her assistant . It was too important . In it , she summarized everything her students should have learned , and if they paid attention and went back over their notes , each had a very good chance of not only doing well on the test but actually learning the material . The lights dimmed in response to California 's latest energy worries , and the auditorium emptied quickly . As they often did , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her office . " But should n't the ' good ' person resist the power of the mob ? " one asked . Tall eucalyptus trees swayed in the ocean breeze . The air smelled fresh , of sea salt and sunshine . Liz breathed deeply , enjoying the summery morning , enjoying her life . " Absolutely , " she agreed . " But with that , we 're getting into ethics . " " It 's not an easy thing to do , " another said quietly . " To resist , I mean . " " Right , " said a third . " When the surf 's up , sometimes you 've just got ta dive in . " " And sometimes not , " Liz reminded them . She liked their questions . They were thinking , which was the major point of an education , as far as she was concerned . " Ask yourselves what it takes to say no when everyone else is insisting yes . Once you start to consider how you 'd like to behave , you begin to build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , and you will face them . " " I 'm really glad you did n't get sucked completely into the TV thing , " the youth who liked surfing said . " I mean , it 's great you 're still teaching . " " I ca n't imagine I 'll ever quit , " she assured him . " Now that we 've got a professional producer and crew for the series , I have more time for you . " They smiled and peppered her with questions about the new episodes on the Cold War that would be aired . " You 'll have to be patient , " she told them . " I 'm sworn to secrecy . " They liked that and laughed . When the small group reached the psychology building , she shooed them on their way . One young man was particularly sweet . He had a crush on her and was often among the group that stayed late . Tongue-tied , he managed to mumble , " Great lecture , Dr. Sansborough , " before shuffling off . Liz pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The building was faded pink concrete , utilitarian , without pretense , which she liked . The corridors bustled with staff and students . When she arrived at her office , Kirk Tedesco was inside , leaning back in her chair , his big Rockports propped up on her desk . He was reading TV Guide . He lowered it and grinned . " Hi , babe . How was the howling mob ? " Her office was cluttered with books and papers . Kirk was the calm in the center of the research storm . She smiled in greeting . " Sharp as little tacks . " She closed the door and dropped her briefcase onto the floor next to her gym bag . " Right . In your wildest . " Kirk was a psych professor , too , specializing in personality disorders . He was so easygoing that his scholarship was on the light side , but he was friendly and fun , and she had grown to depend on his companionship . " No , really , Kirk , " she told him . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . I 'm glad I stayed for them . Paris can wait until tomorrow . " He picked up TV Guide again and waved it at her . " Nice article in here about you and the new season . " She took it from him , pleased . The first four shows for this new series were in the can , the next three were being filmed , and she was researching future ones . Her gaze ran down the story : Sansborough 's Cold War Series Is Back ! One word-and a simple image-said it all . Last month , posters that read " July 29 " in scarlet red , with " Top Secret " stamped across in black , plastered New York City 's bus shelters . No photos . No title . But to aficionados , it was a code that sent shudders of delight that the wait for Dr. Liz Sansborough 's sleeper hit , Secrets of the Cold War , to return was almost over . A Compass network executive revealed that among the chilling Cold War situations to be aired was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . Also on tap was a hushed-up FBI scandal that included a KGB defector who was a master of disguise . In just three years , Dr. Sansborough 's series has grown from a local cable show into an underground sensation . As for next season , the psychology professor tantalized us with the prospect of juicy details about some of the Cold War 's most elusive and deadly players-global assassins such as the renowned Abu Nidal and lesser-known , but many say mythical , figures like the Carnivore and the Abbot .... " Good coverage , " she agreed , and tossed it back at him . " It 's more than that . Someday your face is going to be as famous as Julia Roberts 's . You 're already a hell of a lot prettier . " " And you 're full of blue sky . " But she grinned , grateful , because he had been a reluctant supporter of the series . The window in her office looked back over the campus , north toward the sawtooth peaks of the Santa Ynez Mountains . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She peeled her shirt over her head and stepped out of her trousers . " Nice jogging bra , " Kirk said . " Nice thong bikini . " She ignored him and stepped into her running shorts . " Are n't you getting bored ? You drop by to see me do this three or four times a week , you and your lame excuses . You 've got too much time on your hands , Kirk . Hey , you did n't even bother with an excuse this time . " She pulled her hair back into a ponytail and slipped a band around it . " Definitely not bored . And I have a very good excuse . " He lowered his feet to the floor and advanced on her . He was a square man , early forties , nice big shoulders , going a little soft in the middle , which she found endearing . " Go away . " She shook her head , amused , and knelt to tie the laces of her shoes . " This is my jogging time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetizing in shorts than in that prison jumpsuit you wear for karate . " With his cheerful face , freckles , and red hair , Kirk was easy on the eyes . They had arrived at UCSB in 1998 , the recipients of two brand-new chairs funded by the prestigious Aylesworth Foundation . In the same department , and single , they had gravitated toward each other and become friends . The rest had developed slowly . " So tell me what your excuse is . " She jumped up and lifted her knees , loosening her muscles . " The dean 's summer bash . This afternoon , remember ? It begins at three o'clock . Want to meet there , or are you going to let me pick you up ? " " Let 's meet . " She patted his shirt and gave him a quick kiss on the lips . He grabbed for her , and she dodged . " You 're going to get all sweaty , " he warned , eyes twinkling . " Looking forward to it , too . " She found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipped her keys into her fanny pack , he ambled to his office . Eagerly , she ran down the stairs and out into the hazy California sunshine . Paris , France When it was ten o'clock in the morning in California , it was seven o'clock in the evening in France . As Liz Sansborough left for her run in Santa Barbara , some six thousand miles away Sarah Walker and Asher Flores strolled across the lobby of their Latin Quarter hotel , holding hands . They were a handsome couple , somewhere between the ages of thirty-five and forty . He had curly black hair and a strong face , with the kind of sharp gaze that was never fully at rest . She was tall and lanky , with short auburn hair . A dark mole just above the right corner of her smiling mouth gave her a dramatic air , and the small finger on her left hand was crooked , hinting at some past athletic endeavor gone amiss . They had arrived in Paris the night before and checked into her cousin 's favorite hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , had postponed her arrival until tomorrow . Neither Sarah nor Asher was the type to wait around . They had gone sight-seeing , visiting the Louvre and other traditional tourist places for which they had never had time , and returned to change for dinner . The night portier caught sight of them through the glass lobby door . He pulled it open and bowed . " Mademoiselle Sansborough , " he greeted her . " A pleasant surprise . I did not realize you were staying with us again . " Sarah shot him a smile as she headed out under the awning . " Sorry , but I 'm not Liz Sansborough . She was delayed .
