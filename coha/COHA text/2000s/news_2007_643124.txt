<p> MEXICO CITY - In the 14 years since a car crash left him paralyzed from the chest down , Joaquin Alva has not let anyone deter him from his dream of walking again . <p> So when a Mexico City-based health-club chain barred him from using its facilities , the 31-year-old federal government worker decided to teach the company a lesson in disability rights . <p> He 's achieved more than that . In a country where the disabled have long lived on the fringes of society , suffered discrimination or simply been ignored , Alva has made their plight headline news . And in the process , he 's shamed the government into enforcing , in his case , its much-touted new laws protecting disabled rights . <p> It took five months . But faced with a lawsuit , government fines and a public relations nightmare , Sports World agreed to make its 10 health clubs disabled-accessible within three months . <p> It also has accepted Alva 's proposal to provide 30 free memberships for the disabled , including 15 members of Mexico 's Special Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A decade ago , such a settlement would have been unthinkable here . <p> Mexico has come a long way in legislating disability rights since the first law on the subject took effect in the capital city in 1995 , activists and experts say . <p> But the laws are not uniformly enforced , and the country has a long way to go to catch up with others such as the United States . <p> " This is huge . How many cases like this never come to light ? " Alva , who uses a wheelchair and walks with the aid of elbow crutches and leg braces , said after the company issued a public apology on national television . <p> Source of inspiration <p> Amalia Gamio , the disabilities coordinator of the National Council to Prevent Discrimination , a quasi-government agency that brokered Alva 's settlement , asked the same question . <p> She and others expressed hope that Alva 's decision to press his case would inspire other disabled victims of discrimination to file complaints with the federal government . <p> Nationwide , Gamio said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Former President Vicente Fox , who governed from 2000 to 2006 , opened the first presidential office for the disabled . <p> In 2003 , he sponsored a law that created Gamio 's agency , an autonomous body that defends the rights of all minority groups . <p> The government ratified a regional treaty , enacted several laws and hosted the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities . <p> But the government 's efforts have not yet had the impact that advocates for the disabled had hoped . <p> " In Mexico , we 're still at the very beginning , " said Gamio , a doctor with a speciality in rehabilitation medicine . <p> The government , she said , should start by enforcing existing laws , beginning with imposing mandated $60 fines for parking in disabled spaces . <p> " The people who do that know nothing will happen to them , " she said . " It 's great to have campaigns to sensitize people to the issue , but frankly , it 's more effective to fine them . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Starting in 2003 , all federal agencies were ordered to make their facilities disabled-accessible within five years . But the law exempts those offices with budgetary problems , the vast majority . <p> Efforts applauded <p> Still , some U.S. activists say the Mexican government should be applauded for taking the first steps toward helping the disabled . <p> " While it may take some time for Mexico to implement its intentions and the new laws , the fact that it has stepped forward on an international scale to represent these kinds of principles is very significant , " said Lex Friedan , senior vice president of The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research of Houston . <p> Friedan , who helped draft the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act , said it took the U.S. decades to create comprehensive legislation . <p> " I 'd say Mexico has moved forward very quickly , " he said . <p> Mexican officials acknowledge they are hampered by a lack of information . <p> The country 's 2000 census puts the disabled population at 1.8 million , but the survey 's method has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile , estimates Mexico 's disabled population at 10 percent , or about 10 million people . <p> Funding for training in special education is also scarce . <p> Though legislation dating to the 1990s requires all schools to adapt to the special needs of disabled children , most still lack such services . As a result , only 33,000 of the 320,000 disabled children recorded in the census attended regular schools in 2003 , and most do not attend school at all , according to government figures . <p> Surviving on handouts <p> Many end up like 22-year-old America Parra , who spends her days selling gum at a smoggy intersection in the capital . <p> Parra , who has cerebral palsy and is confined to a wheelchair , attended a private special-education school for four years . But her scholarship ran out , and her mother , Isabel Aguilar , was forced to quit her job selling flowers to take care of her . <p> " She 's very intelligent , " Aguilar said as she wheeled her daughter toward a prospective customer at a red light . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , they 'd mistreat her . " <p> The mother and daughter share a tiny cinderblock-and-tarpaper shack in a former squatter 's colony . <p> They survive on charity from motorists and government handouts . <p> In 2000 , Mexico City 's leftist-run municipal government began providing $70 monthly pensions to the disabled , which Aguilar uses to buy her daughter adult diapers and other supplies , including tires for her wheelchair . <p> But Alva , who forced the health-club chain to accept the disabled , is critical of the program . <p> He says it reinforces the idea that people with disabilities are helpless . <p> Instead , he argues , the money would have been better spent building specialty clinics . <p> " Charity wo n't resolve the cycle of poverty " affecting 90 percent of Mexico 's disabled , he said . <p> In comparison , Alva says he has been fortunate : He attended private college , holds a midlevel job at the federal Government Secretariat , which oversees internal security in Mexico , and drives an adapted Volkswagen Jetta . <p> Until his experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered discrimination . <p> But the activist group he founded in 1997 , Together Step by Step , has given him a window into the problems facing other disabled Mexicans , starting with the lack of basic infrastructure . <p> Alva said his organization has built more than 1,500 wheelchair ramps on Mexico City 's sidewalks with private funding . <p> " There 's a solution for everything , " said Alva . " But you have to stop seeing it as a cost , and instead see it as a human right . " ## Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
