<p> Military nuclear activities at Hunters Point shipyard , dating from World War II , have come back to haunt San Francisco and slow up the Navy 's transfer of land to the city . <p> The Navy , at the behest of concerned Bayview and Hunters Point neighbors , is digging deep into its secret atomic past , trying to find any hot spots that it may have missed in the cleanup at former laboratories , buildings and other locations used for testing or disposing of radiological materials . <p> At stake are city plans to develop housing , commercial space and parks for an area where unemployment is staggeringly high . <p> Before the plan proceeds , the Community First Coalition , an organization made up of residents , shipyard artisans and environmental groups , wants to assure a high-priority nuclear cleanup at the 500-acre former base . <p> Many people in the neighborhoods , particularly African American residents , worked at the shipyard or are children of those workers . They point to hundreds of cancers and other illnesses that they connect with asbestos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLION AND COUNTING <p> The federal government placed the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard on the Superfund list of the nation 's worst toxic waste sites in 1989 . Since then , about $300 million has been spent on cleanup , but none of the shipyard 's six parcels has received a sign-off . City Proposition P demands that the land be cleaned to the " highest practicable standard . " <p> The Navy is running newspaper ads searching for former workers whose stories might fill in important blanks in the real life history of nuclear experiments and dumping . So far , more than 100 people from around the United States have responded . <p> " If they do n't look for the radioactive materials , they wo n't find them . The Navy had radio-logical labs all over the place , " said Lynne Brown , a founder of the Community First Coalition . <p> " Someone developing the land , they could come across it . If it rains , the water goes into the ground and grass grows , bringing up the contaminants . A child could roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a building roof that never had been investigated . We know there is nuclear waste in a big landfill and in bay fill . " <p> MORE RESEARCH REQUIRED <p> In January , the Navy notified the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that it had more work to do to complete an important radiological assessment , dating back to 1939 , before it could present land for transfer . <p> Playing into the decision were objections from the EPA , the state and neighbors that the Navy had done an inadequate job on the past research . <p> The decision followed an unexpected discovery in late December : three boxes of documents from C. Sharp Cook , a high-ranking physicist based at the shipyard who was compiling a book when he died . <p> Navy officials already knew they needed to remove old radium dials buried in bay muds , and investigate possible radioactivity in nearby molten metal heaps and several buildings . There may be radioactive waste in a 46-acre landfill . <p> The officials do n't believe that the new information will turn up unknown radioactive hazards , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't detected anything emanating from inside the landfill that would be an immediate threat to human health , " said David DeMars , the Navy 's remedial project manager for the shipyard restoration . <p> LAND TRANSFER ON HOLD <p> City officials expected a transfer of the first parcel , A , by this spring . Yet the Navy needs to first finish cleanup , then get approval from regulatory agencies . The Navy 's decision to further investigate its radiological past will slow down a transfer by at least six months . <p> The city has reached tentative agreement with a developer , Lennar/BVHP Partners , to develop on Parcel A  --  about 20 percent of the shipyard . This first phase includes building 1,600 houses , at least 32 percent for low-moderate and middle-income residents , and constructing 300,000 square feet of commercial space , 34 acres of parks and open space , and six acres of land dedicated for community health care , education and job training . <p> The Community First Coalition , however , wants to create a different reuse plan that would require developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly benefit residents . They are crafting a plan where the city would build a higher percentage of affordable houses and rentals , and offer construction and cleanup jobs in Bayview and Hunters Point . <p> The Navy bought the shipyard from Bethlehem Steel Co. and took it over just 11 days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor . By 1945 , it had grown 11 times in size to 597 acres , employing more than 18,000 men and women and supporting its own newspaper , church and fire department . <p> LITTLE BOY 'S DEPARTURE POINT <p> The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was shipped in pieces from Los Alamos , N.M. , to the shipyard , its departure point by ship . The bomb was assembled in the Pacific Ocean , according to the Defense Department . <p> The shipyard became the center of the nation 's early nuclear program , housing the West Coast site of the Naval Radiation Defense Laboratory , established in 1946 to study the effects of nuclear weapons and develop countermeasures . The lab operated on nearly three dozen sites on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 600 civilian personnel worked there . <p> Cloaked in secrecy , the scientists produced ionizing radiation with nuclear accelerators , and conducted experiments on animals using a wide range of radionuclides , according to records . Besides nuclear warfare projects , they also worked on biological and chemical warfare projects , documents say . <p> " I had no idea there were any hazards that had anything to do with bombs . ' Radiological ' to me when I was 22 seemed to have a lot more to do with radio than radiation , " said Janice M. Gale , who worked in the nuclear lab 's library for seven months in 1948 . <p> " They 'd say , ' Oh , we had a spill today . ' I did n't know what a spill was . Had we had health and safety measures , that would have clued me in . I had no idea there was anything toxic at the shipyard . I never heard the word ' decontamination . ' It was a shipyard , and they repaired the ships , I thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacted the Navy in response to the ads to tell her story . She would come to the gate every morning , walk directly to her desk , and get to work . " We did n't do much tromping around . It was understood that you came to work and stayed in your place . They never mentioned war work . I thought they were doing pure research . " <p> Between 1946 and 1970 , the test animals , paint from the hot ships , clothing and other radiated waste were put into 55-gallon steel drums , among the 47,500 barrels coming from U.S. activities nationwide . They were dumped in a 365-square-mile area four to 15 miles southwest of the Farallon Islands , where they broke and corroded . <p> Also left behind in bay fill and the on-site dump were luminescent dials , gauges and deck markers containing radium-226 , which decays to radon gas and radioactive lead , both carcinogens . There were spills , fires and heavy rains , which moved around the radioactive materials . <p> DEEP BLUE WASTELAND <p> At the shipyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A-bomb tests in 1946 and 1947 . Seven months after the Independence was hit , the still radioactive vessel was the first one brought to San Francisco for further decontamination . In the dry docks , workers would flush the salt water systems with acid and sandblast hulls down to the metal . Most went into the bay . <p> The Independence was moored at the shipyard and used as a nuclear waste storage dump as well as a test lab for decontamination studies . In 1951 , the Navy sunk it about 30 miles off Half Moon Bay . At least 10 other target ships were sunk farther out to sea . <p> From 1955 to 1969 , the military consolidated the nuclear lab near Crisp Avenue in the multistory , windowless Building 815 , which was sold to a private party in 1979 and now is leased by a records storage business . At the time , the lab drains emptied into two 10,000-gallon steel holding tanks , then to the city sewer system . <p> The Navy leased most of the shipyard to Triple A , a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to June 30 , 1986 . <p> Despite the widespread use of the shipyard for radiological activities , the EPA , which has oversight authority , says its independent scanning on most of the shipyard , not including the landfill , has n't turned up residual radiation . <p> " Just to put to bed any concerns would be a good thing , " said the EPA 's Superfund cleanup manager , Claire Trombadore , about the new historical information . " I would be very surprised if they found anything . " E-mail Jane Kay at jkay@sfchronicle.com.
