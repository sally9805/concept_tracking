At that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! <br> <br>  --  Pride and Prejudice <br> <br> Less than a year into the marriage that made her mistress of one of England 's finest houses , Elizabeth Darcy knew she still had much to learn about the place she now called home . Of one thing , however , she was certain . <br> <br> A ghost haunted Pemberley . <br> <br> She was not a ghost in the traditional sense . She did not moan , or shriek , or rattle chains . She did not cause rooms to grow cold , objects to fall , or fires to sputter . She did not manifest at midnight to pace on creaking floorboards , visiting in death the rooms she had occupied in life . <br> <br> Yet the continued presence of Lady Anne Fitzwilliam Darcy was as real and pervasive as that of any spectre . And far more difficult to exorcise . Though her corporeal form had been laid to rest nearly twenty years earlier , she inhabited the estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long that her daughter-in-law wondered whether she would ever escape it . <br> <br> Elizabeth had known coming into her marriage that she entered a family and a house with a long , respected history . She had embraced that history , and her new place in it , as she had embraced her husband and the life he had offered her when they wed . She had thought she was prepared for her new role as mistress of Pemberley . She had not realized that the previous occupant had not yet vacated it . <br> <br> " You are  --  you are certain , ma'am ? " <br> <br> Elizabeth left the corner of the small parlor and crossed to a spot nearer the center of the room . " Yes , " she assured the housekeeper . " Quite certain . I would like the desk moved over here , facing the window . " <br> <br> " Of course . I will summon the footmen directly . " Despite her statement , Mrs. Reynolds made no move . The white-haired housekeeper lingered in the doorway of Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing to say more but holding back out of deference to her employer . <br> <br> Circumstances had prevented Elizabeth from spending much time at Pemberley since marrying Fitzwilliam Darcy nine months ago , but in that period she had come to respect Mrs. Reynolds 's intelligence and opinions . One did not casually dismiss the concerns of a trusted servant with twenty-five years ' tenure , and the housekeeper 's advice had proven critical in easing Elizabeth 's adjustment to overseeing a house far grander than the ones she had known growing up . Mrs. Reynolds was both extremely capable and unquestionably loyal to the Darcy family . <br> <br> Sometimes too loyal . Guessing the source of the housekeeper 's reservations , Elizabeth nevertheless asked , " Is there any reason not to move the desk , Mrs. Reynolds ? " She resigned herself to the anticipated reply . <br> <br> " Her ladyship preferred it in the corner . At certain times of year , this part of the room receives very strong sunlight . Lady Anne found the glare unpleasant . " <br> <br> Lady Anne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household , had also found the Wedgwood breakfast set superior to any of Pemberley 's many others , particularly the Royal Worcester china Elizabeth had thought to use last week . The fortnight previous , she had learned that the pattern of the music room 's wallpaper was the only possible one that could adequately complement the view from that chamber 's windows . The bird motif of the conservatory , another selection of her predecessor 's , Elizabeth did not dare touch . Further , Lady Anne 's taste in decorating had apparently been matched by equal excellence as an art collector , hostess , domestic manager , and philanthropist . As a result , Elizabeth had begun to find the glare of Lady Anne 's perfection growing unpleasant . <br> <br> " Thank you for the information , but I do not care to face a wall when I write , " she said . " I would much rather look out . Pemberley has such beautiful grounds . I am exceptionally fond of the south garden . " <br> <br> Mrs. Reynolds smiled wistfully . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  selected all the plants and put them in the ground with her own hands . But I am sure you already knew that . " <br> <br> " It might have been mentioned to me previously . " <br> <br> The housekeeper withdrew , and minutes later two footmen arrived to relocate the rosewood writing desk . As weary as she had become of most things related to Lady Anne , Elizabeth had to concede her own partiality for this particular furnishing . The graceful Chippendale piece practically beckoned one to take a seat and invent cause for correspondence . <br> <br> The footmen lowered the desk to rest in its new position , then replaced the items they had removed from its top during the transfer . As soon as they left , Elizabeth rearranged the quill stand , wick trimmer , and wax jack , the latter of which she managed to drop in the process . She seemed to be dropping a lot of things lately . She bent to retrieve it  --  a motion more difficult now than it had been mere weeks ago  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then slid into place rather than trust herself to lift . <br> <br> She sat at the desk , admiring the prospect from its chair . From her new vantage point , she could see not only the river and valley , as she could previously , but also the south garden . Though Michaelmas approached , the roses yet held their own , the marigolds vigorously announced their intention to stay until kissed by frost , and the morning glories climbed heavenward . The blooms ' gentle perfume wafted through the open windows , dominated by a particularly sweet fragrance . As she attempted to identify it , her husband entered . <br> <br> She held her breath as he silently noted the desk 's new location . Though Darcy had given her leave to make any changes in the house she wished , and had especially encouraged her to remake Lady Anne 's former rooms into her own , she could not escape consciousness of the fact that any alteration of hers severed another small tie to the mother he had lost at far too young an age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving birth to his sister , Georgiana . Their father , George Darcy , had left most of his beloved wife 's effects untouched , and his son had made minimal changes in the six years since he inherited the estate . Out of sensitivity to her husband 's feelings , and those of Georgiana , she hesitated to adapt much at Pemberley to her own taste . A lifetime stretched before them  --  time enough for a gradual transformation . She need not sweep in and obliterate all traces of the first woman he had loved . If not yet secure in her role as Pemberley 's mistress , she was secure enough in Darcy 's affections to share them with his mother 's memory . <br> <br> If only that memory were not so idealized . Lady Anne had been loved not only by her family , but also by friends , neighbors , tenants , and servants . She had been a paragon of grace and lived an idyllic life . How Elizabeth would ever find her own place here , she could scarcely imagine . <br> <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You shall enjoy a finer view . " <br> <br> She exhaled . " I am glad you agree . Mrs. Reynolds so disapproves that I thought I might have to move the desk myself . " <br> <br> " I hope you jest . No mistress of Pemberley should be pushing furniture across a room , but especially not one in your condition . " <br> <br> " Of course I jest . If the servants mutinied , I would have prevailed upon you . " <br> <br> " And if I resisted ? " <br> <br> " I might have threatened to name this baby something ridiculous , such as Nancy . " <br> <br> " Nancy Darcy ? You would never saddle a daughter of yours with such a singsong name . Besides , you carry a boy . The Darcys for countless generations have fathered boys as their first offspring , so it only stands to reason that we would continue the family tradition . " <br> <br> " Very well , then . Quincy Darcy . " <br> <br> " You do not frighten me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> <br> " Enough . We shall name him something that sounds well with Darcy . Richard , perhaps . " <br> <br> " Nay , not Richard . That , I could not countenance . " <br> <br> " It is a perfectly respectable name . In fact , it is the name of the physician I wish to engage for your lying-in . Dr. Richard Severn . " <br> <br> " The London doctor ? I thought we agreed our child would be born here ? " <br> <br> " I will arrange for him to stay at Pemberley during your confinement . He already divides his time between London and Bath , where he is at present , so I am certain he can be persuaded to come to Derbyshire this winter . " <br> <br> " Should we not meet Dr. Severn first ? What if we do not like him ? " <br> <br> " He has an excellent reputation . " <br> <br> " So does the village midwife . " <br> <br> His expression grew shuttered . " I do not want to entrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not want to entrust it to a doctor I have never met . " <br> <br> He regarded her quietly a moment , his air grown serious . " Very well , " he said finally . " When we have concluded our visit with the Bingleys , we will return home via Bath  --  provided you feel well enough to prolong our travel . " <br> <br> " Our little Darcy has been behaving herself much more of late . " <br> <br> " I am glad to hear it . You have looked rather green these many weeks . " <br> <br> " I feel quite better . " The morning queasiness that had plagued the early weeks of her condition had nearly abated  --  a fact for which she was grateful . Her sister Jane , who had just delivered her first child , had suffered nausea right up until the day she was brought to bed . Though Elizabeth remained hypersensitive to scent , only a few smells yet set her insides quaking . " In fact , just now I am famished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <br> <br> " It is only half past ten . " <br> <br> " Your child can not yet tell time . " She headed toward the bellpull , discovering on her way a folded sheet of paper on the floor . Certain it had not been there during her conversation with Mrs. Reynolds , she took it up . <br> <br> " What have you found ? " Darcy asked . <br> <br> " A letter . " <br> <br> " On the floor ? The servants are seldom so careless . " <br> <br> The note was sealed with the cinquefoil symbol from the Darcy crest . She turned it over and discovered her name on the front : Mrs. Fitzwilliam Darcy . She smiled softly . Had her husband , intending some surprise , dropped it for her to find ? " It is addressed to me , " she said , studying his expression closely . <br> <br> " Indeed ? " His countenance remained open , revealing mild interest but betraying no prior knowledge of the note . " From whom ? " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sudden appearance , after all . Now that she looked at it again , the handwriting resembled Georgiana 's more than his , but was not quite his sister 's hand , either . <br> <br> Her curiosity piqued , she broke the seal and unfolded the paper . The lines began neatly but became progressively uneven and blotted . She quickly scanned to the end , then lifted her gaze to Darcy in astonishment . <br> <br> " It is from your mother .
