Fall Out Boy Folie Deux 3 stars CRITIC 'S CHOICE PUNK-POP First it was Green Day with American Idiot . Then it was My Chemical Romance with The Black Parade . Now it 's Fall Out Boy 's turn to make their Big Album . After raising the stakes on 2007 's Infinity on High , they do it again , with an even greater payoff . Just check out this disc 's epic centerpiece , " What a Catch , Donnie , " which pours on the strings and a choirful of guest vocalists from Elvis Costello to Panic at the Disco 's Brendon Urie . Then they turn around and get funky with Lil Wayne one moment ( " Tiffany Blews " ) , psychedelic with Pharrell the next ( " w.a.m.s . " ) . But songs like " America 's Suitehearts , " one of Folie 's commentaries on fame , show that while FOB may be a big-boy band now , they can still deliver the punk-pop hooks . Brandy Human 3 stars R &B-POP; After releasing her best disc ever , 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life hit the skids : She became a judge on America 's Got Talent and triggered a fatal car accident two years ago . It 's good to have her back on the pop scene -- and off the has-been trail -- with her fifth studio album . The former golden girl of Moesha deals with her tarnished image by revealing just how human she is . On " Camouflage " she refuses to hide her flaws from a lover , while on the title cut , the emotional highlight , she pleads , " Save me from myself . " Another ballad , " Torn Down , " sounds less about the unbreakable strength of a relationship and more about Brandy being a real survivor . Common Universal Mind Control 3 stars RAP Common has always been able to move minds with his socially conscious rap , but now he 's concerned about moving booties . While the club-ready results ( with most beats by the Neptunes ) do n't match the inspired -- and inspiring -- heights of 2005 's Be or 2007 's Finding Forever , it 's nice to hear Common cut loose and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still got more going on in his head .

BOX QUICK CUTS MUSIQ SOULCHILD OnMyRadio This R &B; singer still has an aversion to spaces between the words in his titles . It 's a quirk that may be getting a little old on his fifth album . But the sensitive soul of tracks like " DeserveUMore " and " Until " still satisfies . 3 stars THE FIREMAN Electric Arguments The Beatles and Wings are n't the only groups Paul McCartney 's blessed . He 's also paired with producer Youth in this experimental outfit . Their third disc -- the first with vocals -- can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars RANDY HOUSER Anything Goes Houser has already had a taste of major success in Nashville , cowriting Trace Adkins 's hit " Honky Tonk Badonkadonk . " But he 's better when going for the heart with ballads on his country debut . 2 stars TRAVIS Ode to J. Smith It 's hard to be a U.K. band when the Next Big Things just keep coming , some of them actually living up to the hype . Still , these veterans should n't be overlooked with the atmospheric alt-rock on their sixth studio CD. 3 stars BOX CATCHING UP WITH ... LADY GAGA * With her Top 5 hit " Just Dance , " this singer , 22 , has found The Fame from her clubby debut . ON HOW SHE GOT HER NAME My producer said I was so over the top and theatrical , like Freddie Mercury , so he used to call me Gaga after the Queen song " Radio Ga Ga . " ON HER AVANT-GARDE FASHION My intention is to one day have the Lady Gaga exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors to a $3 bra from Conway . ON A CLOTHES ENCOUNTER WITH THE POLICE I was on my way to perform at Lollapalooza in Chicago . I was on my bike and I had on hot pants . This cop was like , " You look totally inappropriate . There are children around here . " He was trying to arrest me , but he just ended up giving me a citation .
