Vocal Hero Bjrk 's latest , riskiest album is mostly instrument-free . Sound weird ? Sure . But it may make you violently happy , by Chris Willman BJRK Medlla ( Elektra/Atlantic ) Bjrk and Lars von Trier did n't really see eye to blind eye when he directed her in Dancer in the Dark a few years back , but the mercurial singer might have absorbed more of the contrary filmmaker 's ethos than she realized . With his Dogma 95 " Vow of Chastity , " von Trier dismissed supposed artificialities like sets , props , and scoring . In the similarly austere yet extravagant Medlla , Bjrk ditches bourgeois frills like strings and drum machines in favor of , exclusively , the human voice . Well , near exclusively ; perhaps still wary of complete dogmatism , she allows cameos on a few tracks by the odd bass synthesizer , piano , or ( now she 's getting carried away ! ) gong . But aside from those passing instrumental cheats , Bjrk is taking a big , fat Gregorian chance on full-on a cappella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason no major rock figure has attempted an all-vocal album since Todd Rundgren 's A Cappella in 1985 , a moderately amusing if literally long-winded experiment in vocally mimicking real instruments . There 's a little of that sort of ear trickery in Medulla ; five numbers utilize Rahzel , formerly of the Roots , as a human beat box , and one has frequent Philip Glass vocalist Gregory Purnhagen credited as a " human trombone . " But mostly , these voices are meant to sound like voices , whether Bjrk is wailing against the Icelandic Choir 's wall of sound or madly multitracking herself like The Matrix 's Agent Smith . Besides all these mass exhalations , there 's a lot of flesh , bone , and blood in the lyrics , too ( " Smooth soft red velvety lungs are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully through a nose ... " ) . She 's like a convert to nudism , suddenly convinced that " gear " is the equivalent of a heavy coat in May . Beware : Her evangelistic zeal is so strong , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park in your birthday suit too . Bjrk began recording the album with those darned old instruments before her au naturel epiphany , but only a couple of tracks belie their origins as conventional pop songs . Most easily digestible is the peppy , nearly hiphop-flavored " Triumph of a Heart " tucked away at disc 's end , as if a reward for making it through the more challenging passages . Leading up to that , you get a few sinister-sounding examinations of human behavior whose growling , gulping , or moaning will alienate some ears . " Submarine " has guest Robert Wyatt warbling for help in queasy falsetto , sounding like Carl Wilson trapped under ice . Her strikingly beautiful Olympics song , " Oceania , " is more rapturously aquatic , the computer-enhanced choir behind Bjrk suggesting a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins . Here she imagines herself as the sea itself , proud of all the belegged creatures she 's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years . It 's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not to sound like the Manhattan Transfer or Bobby McFerrin . " Well , duh-but if that was hardly a danger , there was every likelihood that the album 's synths-for-larynxes quid pro quo would be remembered as a stunt , at best , instead of one of her best efforts . To anyone approaching Medulla with that apprehension , we offer these four words : Do n't worry , be happy . <p>
