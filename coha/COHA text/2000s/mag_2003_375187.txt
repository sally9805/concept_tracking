If Alan Greenspan is so worried that deflation  --  falling prices for goods and services  --  could hurt the economy , why is it that so many prices seem to be going up ? <P> It all has to do with what you 're measuring . The core Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , which the Fed chairman watches , is up only 1.5% ( and could turn negative , the Fed warns ) , but it does n't include volatile food and energy prices . The cost of services , which includes out-of-pocket expenses that you notice most , has risen nearly twice as much as the core CPI  --  2.8% in April over the year before . Car insurance rose 9% , consumer health premiums 8% , college tuition 7% . Altogether , services make up about 24% of household spending . Then there 's housing , which accounts for 32% of spending . It rose 2.2% . <P> Offsetting these increases is a 1.7% drop in prices for goods like cars , clothing and computers , which account for 23% of spending . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept prices low . That 's something a dentist or restaurant owner , with less flexible rent and labor costs , ca n't easily do . Food and energy prices ( the remaining 21% of spending ) have been rising ( energy sharply ) over the past few months but are expected to fall later this year . If you include them , the overall CPI was up 2.2% in April . <P> Another problem with the inflation data is the mythical average household . If you spend a lot on health care or have three kids in college , your reality will not match the norm . To adjust for changes in demographics and spending habits , the average is recalculated every two years . But it still lags some trends . Cell phones and Internet access are significant new expenses for many families that are n't adequately captured in the latest CPI . And today 's cost-of-living adjustments do n't reflect looming shocks , like the $78 billion cumulative deficit that state governments will soon be making up with hikes in taxes and fees . For many workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2% raises  --  if they get any raises at all .  --  By Jyoti Thottam
