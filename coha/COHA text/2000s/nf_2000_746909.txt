Section : IN CONTEXT Healthcare and Public Policy <p> The egregious fact that people are suffering , and in some cases dying , as a consequence of processes not directly connected to health care , elicits neither rebuttal nor response .  --  R. G. Evans and G. L. Stoddart ( n1 ) <p> <p> One day I am going to die  --  maybe tomorrow , maybe thirty years from now . Right now , I do n't want to die tomorrow . There are too many things I want to do . In thirty years my story might well be different ; then I may be ready to die . My mother recently died . She slipped away three months shy of her 93rd birthday . She had reached the point where she wanted to die . I remember her becoming angry with God and saying , " Is n't it my turn to come on Your list ? " But even when she reached that point , on her good days I could tell that she might have enjoyed going a bit further . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her early nineties . So , she died . Just as you will die and I will die . <p> Medical professionals , for the most part , do n't like people to die . So it makes sense for them to find the cures for the leading causes of death . In the most recent update from the National Center for Health Statistics 's FASTATS , the leading cause of death in the United States in 1997 was heart disease , from which 726,974 people died . Cancer was next with 539,577 deaths . Then there was a big drop to deaths from stroke ( 159,791 ) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 109,019 ) . ( n2 ) <p> In this column I will look at three questions : With respect to resource allocation , to what degree should " leading causes of death " influence us ? Should our resources be focused primarily on the medical causes of death , or would we do better to look at a wide array of intermediate causes ? If we opt to focus on fostering healthy and flourishing lives rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at leading causes of morbidity ( and the root causes for that morbidity ) rather than leading causes of death ? Dealing with the leading causes of death . <p> At first blush it makes sense to go after those leading diseases with a vengeance . From a personal perspective , I would be foolish not to want to see progress made in the treatment of heart disease . I had my own heart attack in 1994 , followed by triple by-pass surgery in 1995 . I am more than thankful for the incredible technology and the skilled hands and minds that worked on me . But I am also a teacher and a policy analyst , and I am forced to ask how we might best allocate the vast resources of today 's America . <p> Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. ; cancer is the second . That is true overall , but malignant neoplasm is the leading cause of death in the 45-64 age bracket , then is outpaced by heart disease in the over-65 group . In age groups 1-24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents , especially motor vehicle accidents . Interestingly , in the early and probably most intense career years ( ages 25-44 ) , the numbers of death by suicide ( 12,402 ) plus the number of deaths by homicide and legal intervention ( 8,752 )  --  a total of 21,154 deaths  --  exceed the number of deaths by heart disease ( 16,513 ) by 4,641. ( n3 ) <p> My guess is that far more medical dollars , including public health dollars , go into the treatment and prevention of heart disease and cancer , which affect primarily the elderly and middle-aged , than go into the treatment and prevention of accidents , suicides , and homicides . These data give us two bothersome questions . First , are there limits to what we as a society should be spending for those who are nearing the end of life ? Second , if we pursue cures for cancer and heart disease , would it make more sense to go after the most immediate cause ( some immediate etiological agent such as a gene , a germ , or a particular carcinogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoking , etc. ) , or the structural causes ( e.g. , those socio-economic factors that lead people to engage in , or be subjected to , unhealthy places or lifestyles ) ? For the present , I will look only at the second question , because in honestly approaching the second , I think we shall also get at an answer to the first . <p> It might sometimes serve a better purpose not even to try to pinpoint a cause of death . I was saddened when I read my mother 's death certificate . These were the " causes of death " : " electrolyte abnormalities , atrial fibrillation , and congestive heart failure . " All of those causes are probably correct . They are also poignantly wrong . She died of old age , the co-morbidities associated with old age . Her death certificate brought to mind a passage from John Steinbeck : <p> The Mexican Sierra has 17 plus 15 plus 9 spines in the dorsal fin . These can easily be counted . But if the sierra strikes hard on the line so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly escapes and finally comes in over the rail , his colors pulsing and his tail beating the air , a whole new relational externality has come into being  --  an entity which is more than the sum of the fish plus the fisherman . The only way to count the spines of the sierra unaffected by this second relational reality is to sit in a laboratory , open an evil  --  smelling jar , remove a stiff colorless fish from the formalin solution , count the spines , and write the truth .... There you have recorded a reality which can not be assailed-probably the least important reality concerning either the fish or yourself. ( n4 ) <p> If attacking only the proximate causes of death seems to be a poor use of resources , it might make more sense to look at what contributes to such causes . Backing up : looking at what leads to the cause of death . <p> In 1974 Henrik Blum wrote a popular and influential book that provided a classic schematic for looking at the contributing causes to both good and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behavior ( or lifestyle ) , the environment , and the healthcare system itself . Influencing those four factors are the broader characteristics of the larger population , its cultural systems , the global and regional ecosystems , and the natural resources of the area. ( n5 ) This schematic formed the basis for looking at the entire socio-ecological system as the focus for improving the health of populations . <p> As a matter of historical record , it seems that the least contributory factor to the health of the overall population is the healthcare system . In reference to the work of McKeown in 1976 , Robert Evans points out that McKeown 's " central point  --  that the major decline in mortality from most infectious diseases predates effective therapy  --  remains unchallenged . " ( n6 ) In an illustrative graph he shows that the death rate from tuberculosis was 4,000 per million in 1840 . It had dropped to 2,000 per million 40 years later , in 1880 , when the tubercle bacillus was finally identified . It had dropped to slightly less than 500 deaths per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dropped a bit more to approximately 250 per million with the beginning of BCG vaccination in the mid 1950s. ( n7 ) Obviously , something else was happening . I 'm reminded of a passage in an old book  --  a book that the modern practitioner I am sure would find a delight to read  --  that readily grants credit to modern scientific medicine for much of what has been done . But the author , Rene Dubos , hastily reminds us that " by the time laboratory medicine came effectively into the picture the job had been carried far toward completion by the humanitarians and social reformers of the nineteenth century . " ( n8 ) He continues with an illustration that I use in my own classes : <p> When the tide is receding from the beach it is easy to have the illusion that one can empty the ocean by removing water with a pail . The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century. ( n9 ) <p> Our social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be onto something : create healthy environments . To do so requires a systems perspective . What is it that really causes heart disease , cancer , suicide , HIV , homicide , and so on ? We seemed to be on the right track , but we stopped short . The healthcare system quite seriously looked at the Blum model , but something funny happened on the way to the forum . Instead of looking out into the larger social and ecological systems for the " causes " of health and illness , the establishment looked to the individual , as if to say , " Aha ! If you would but improve your lifestyle , that is , stop smoking , stop drinking , stop overeating , choose a cleaner place to live , stop beating your wife , and so on , then you would lead a healthier life . " By turning back the search for root causes of disease to an examination of individual actions , the healthcare system in effect simply created new product lines that it could sell to the public. ( n10 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . No one should escape personal responsibility for doing what one can do for oneself . I accept that as a given . The notion that one can " bootstrap " oneself to health and wealth is so ingrained in our society  --  and so much a part of the extraordinarily prosperous self-help industry  --  that I 'd be foolish to assert that there is not at least something to it . I do wish that the bootstrap philosophers would also recognize that there are many hands that go into making the bootstraps and guiding and supporting the hands that do the lifting . <p> We even seem to be gaining some ground environmentally . If I 'm not mistaken , our lakes and rivers are cleaner than they were in the 1960s . We are working to preserve and restore wetlands . We work to clean the air by reducing hazardous emissions . We are working at it . But it is not easy , and it is not done with unanimity . And we have so far to go . Looking beyond the causes of morbidity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance  --  United States , 1997 , from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , found there to be six leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States  --  motor vehicle crashes , other unintentional injuries , suicide , pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases in adolescents , cardiovascular disease , and cancer . They go on to provide a detailed description of the individual behaviors that contribute to them . Among them are failing to use seat belts , failing to use helmets , consuming alcohol , carrying weapons , fighting , using tobacco , using cocaine and other drugs , failing to use condoms , eating poorly , and so on. ( n11 ) The authors are absolutely right . Stop the poor behaviors and adopt the good behaviors , and everything will be all right . In many cases it looks as though lifestyle and the environment are going to continue to be the dominant culprits . But we must go far beyond those individual behaviors to get at the " cure . " <p> In the first paragraph of his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... poverty is bad for you . As Sophie Tucker said , ' I 've been poor , and I 've been rich . Rich is better . ' " ( n12 ) We know that people at the upper end of the socioeconomic scale live longer and healthier lives . Actually , those who live the longest are white , educated , and well-to-do females . ( I forget whether they live even longer if they are married . But for men , marriage definitely contributes to longevity . ) <p> If we are truly to create healthy populations , we must create ways in which all people can have better lives . This is not by any means a political statement calling for an equal distribution of wealth . It is an appeal to look for means to improve the lot of those who have the least among us . A former student  --  a surgeon and the director of a refugee hospital in Pakistan  --  told me in a recent e-mail that he and his wife , an OB-GYN physician , are engaged in a project of improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if women have the knowledge , they will be able to empower themselves to entirely new roles in their society . That is precisely the approach that duGuerny and Sjoberg found in their study of gender relations and the HIV/AIDS epidemic . One of their strategies as a short-term goal , which I view as both a short- and long-term goal , is to " focus on women 's education and vocational training , in order to enhance women 's economic independence . " ( n13 ) <p> In short , if we want to improve health behaviors , we have to find the structural obstacles to improving healthy behaviors . A short list of some of those structural obstacles includes illiteracy , low pay , poor working conditions , poor housing , and adverse environments . But the greatest socio-structural obstacle is our tendency to view the world in terms of us and them . We know how to treat " us , " thank you . But " them , " well  --  you know how they are ! The greatest challenge of our age is to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cordially invite comments , questions , and suggestions . Simply e-mail me at bruder@cl.uh.edu . <p>
