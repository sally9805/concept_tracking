<p> On Wednesday morning , with only five days left before the big show , Iris Love placed a telephone call . <p> " This is Iris Love , " she said slowly . " I 'm the dachshund dog fancier/archaeologist who has used dachshunds who have worked with me in my excavations . I 'm the person who is giving a party at Tavern on the Green this Sunday , Feb. 8 , for dachshunds , show dogs and dogs in general . " <p> Her introduction and invitation to her annual party  --  a central feature of the pre-Westminster social whirl  --  having been placed , Dr. Love rang off . There was much , much more to do . All across the city , visitors were arriving and preparations were beginning for the 128th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show , which begins its two-day run this morning at Madison Square Garden . The show will be televised , as it is every year . But the peculiar social dance that precedes it  --  unique in all of sporting , often parodied and particular to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private homes . <p> In an expansive penthouse on the Upper East Side , Janet B. York , an erstwhile sex therapist who uses a tiny sculpture of one of her dogs as a door knocker and who has a likeness of another dog printed on a pillow on her bed , spent the week directing a staff of walkers , washers , breeders and administrators to prepare for her own annual party , which was scheduled for Thursday night to avoid competing with Dr. Love 's . <p> Forty miles out on Long Island , Kim Silva was making her own preparations . These were measurably less elaborate . Ms. Silva , who reluctantly followed her older sister into the dog-handling game , had just bought a new outfit for herself , shopping during breaks from classes at Dowling College and her job at a nearby pet supply store . <p> Such is the breadth of devotion among those who call themselves the dog people . Dog people have in common that they brook no dissent on a singular matter . <p> " If you love dogs , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of Lhasa apsos and a resident of Long Island . " If not , you 're not . " <p> Last week , the dog people converged on New York from points far removed : California and Europe and Colorado and elsewhere . <p> On Wednesday , while Dr. Love honed her invitation list , Ms. York drove her dogs 60 miles north of the city to Middletown , N.Y. , for a training session . For company , she had Hans Boelaars , 54 , a breeder from the Netherlands , and her Cavalier King Charles spaniels . <p> The spaniels stand below knee level , with floppy ears and long , furry tails . Their heads are characterized by white streaks between black and brown eye patches , giving each animal the appearance of an aged Mr. T. The star of the group answers to the name Ch . Pippeloentje V. H. Lamslag , or Pippen for short . He is 6 years old and , like his breeder , a native of the Netherlands . Thus the name . <p> After the trip upstate , Mr. Boelaars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York sat in a padded rocking chair in her kennel , a converted kitchen with cages and mounted blow-dryers and an inclined miniature treadmill . Ms. York , who has short , dark hair and deeply tanned skin , wore slip-on shoes and a belt buckle depicting a spaniel in golden bas-relief . The dogs hopped around her , stealing her seat when she rose to go downstairs to her office , used for promoting her sculptures and the dogs ' careers . <p> Outside the kennel room , Ms. York walked past sculptures of spaniels , done in acrylic and bronze . One , called Cecile on the Stairs , depicts a dog looking upward , " the way Cecile used to wait for me by the stairs , " Ms. York said . Another depicts Pippen with a soccer ball . " The reason he 's with a soccer ball is his favorite game is soccer . " <p> Downstairs , she passed a den decorated with dioramas of cavalier spaniels in Christmas scenes . There were display cases full of dog knickknacks , and a dog mask hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pippen , " Ms. York said , sashaying down a hallway , holding an imaginary leash at arm 's length , " it 's breathtaking . " <p> But there was no time for that . Ms. York 's party , which has long dwelled in the shadow of Dr. Love 's Central Park gala , was hardly a day away . Ms. York wondered aloud whether her featured guest , Joseph H. Sulkowski of Nashville , would find the courage to make a speech . This was cause for distress , as the whole theme of the party centered on a new painting by Mr. Sulkowski . Ms. York had seen his work in the publication Dog News  --  " To me , it 's my Bible , " she said  --  and had a group portrait of her spaniels commissioned . <p> The next morning , Mr. Boelaars , the Dutchman , rose early . He stood on a sofa , draped a curtain over the painting in preparation for its unveiling and declared himself in need of a vacation . One of Ms. York 's assistants canvassed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan Keeslar , a resident of Queens who once traveled to ply his horseshoeing craft before settling into the more lucrative and stable enterprise of dog walking , arrived and gathered five of the spaniels . He clasped a metal hook around five leashes imprinted with a telephone number in the 212 area code and took the dogs down the elevator . <p> " This party is ridiculous , " Mr. Keeslar said . " It 's a couple of hundred millionaires with between 4 and 40 dogs . Most of the owners are n't even there with the dogs . " <p> In that regard , however , Ms. York stands apart from much of the crowd at exhibitions by handling her own dogs . Many of the wealthy owners hire professional dog handlers , who are easy to recognize because they tend to pull the bits of dried liver used to excite the dogs from their own mouths rather than from their pockets . <p> Most of those who handle their own dogs , like Karen Mills-Heron , a schoolteacher from Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , who competes at weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ms. Silva , the college student from Long Island , shows her owns bull mastiffs , waist-high dogs that weigh more than 100 pounds and produce slobber by the cup . <p> School and work left Ms. Silva little time for preparation last week . During a lunch break on Thursday , she sat in the kitchen of her parents ' home with Rosie , the dog she planned to show at Westminster , training her eyes on a game show on television . <p> The Silva family got its first bull mastiff in 1990 , and Kim 's sister Heather Silva , who is engaged to a fellow professional dog handler , took to the dogs quickly . Kim stayed with a grandmother during shows but eventually began participating in junior showmanship exhibitions , where her poise  --  not that of the dogs  --  was judged . <p> On Thursday , Heather was expected to arrive from Colorado to compete at Westminster , but Kim was doing little to prepare for her own performance . She told her professors that she would be out of class , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sofa , let her hair fall before her face and tugged at her sweatshirt . <p> " It 's crazy , it 's a very long day , " she said of Westminster . " It gets hot . The people come , and they just want to see your dog , and you do n't want to talk to anybody . " <p> That evening , as Heather Silva and her fiance touched down on Long Island , the festivities were beginning on the Upper East Side . Ms. York had specified that the new portrait of her dogs should be painted in a Renaissance style , so , in keeping with the theme , the lobby was filled with actors in Shakespearean attire , checking coats and making a ruckus . The elevator operator wore a wig , doublet and pelt , perhaps intended to evoke the elevator operators of Elizabethan times . <p> Inside the apartment , waitresses held trays high and in one hand to negotiate the crowd . Pippen roamed freely , though the other dogs were locked in the kennel . <p> Mr. Sulkowski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was screwing up his courage to make a speech . Over his painting hung the curtain , tucked in more carefully than the Dutchman had left it . Mr. Boelaars himself was , once again , nowhere to be seen . <p> Mr. Sulkowski spoke of his influences ( Leonardo da Vinci ) , his career ( intended initially to focus on portraits of humans ) and the crowd . <p> " A lot of them are Renaissance-type characters , " Sulkowski said . " They 're in so many things . They 're just interested in living life . Let there be no mistake , they 're passionate about one thing . Dogs . " <p> Nearby , Rita Remondi , an owner of German Shorthaired Pointers in town from Santa Rosa , Calif. , spotted Tina Truesdale , she of the boxers and affenpinschers ( " Very wealthy , " Ms. Remondi said in a stage whisper ) , in a dress unzipped nearly to her navel and her hair pulled back tight enough to appear painful . They clasped hands and sipped white wine . <p> Before Westminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest on Friday at the Hotel Pennsylvania , a dog handling workshop for children at the Plaza Hotel on Saturday and , of course , Dr. Love 's party in Central Park . <p> This moment , though , belonged to Ms. York , or to Mr. Sulkowski , or to Pippen , or maybe all three . The lights dimmed . Trumpets sounded an evensong . <p> In the back of the room , by the grand piano , Ms. Shein , the the Lhasa Apsos owner , addressed a waiter . <p> " What 's this ? " she said . <p> " Salmon , " he said . <p> " You might as well eat , " Ms. Shein told the waiter . She turned and watched as Ms. York and the Tennessean stood on a window ledge , higher than the crowd , her arm on his shoulder , smiling , the center of attention . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
