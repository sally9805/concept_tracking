I wish Giovanni would kiss me. // Oh , but there are so many reasons why this would be a terrible idea . To begin with , Giovanni is ten years younger than I am , and-like most Italian guys in their twenties-he still lives with his mother . These facts alone make him an unlikely romantic partner for me , given that I am a professional American woman in my mid-thirties , who has just come through a failed marriage and a devastating , interminable divorce , followed immediately by a passionate love affair that ended in sickening heartbreak . This loss upon loss has left me feeling sad and brittle and about seven thousand years old . Purely as a matter of principle I would n't inflict my sorry , busted-up old self on the lovely , unsullied Giovanni . Not to mention that I have finally arrived at that age where a woman starts to question whether the wisest way to get over the loss of one beautiful brown-eyed young man is indeed to promptly invite another one into her bed . This is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why , in fact , I have decided to spend this entire year in celibacy. // To which the savvy observer might inquire : " Then why did you come to Italy ? " // To which I can only reply-especially when looking across the table at handsome Giovanni- " Excellent question . " // Giovanni is my Tandem Exchange Partner . That sounds like an innuendo , but unfortunately it 's not . All it really means is that we meet a few evenings a week here in Rome to practice each other 's languages . We speak first in Italian , and he is patient with me ; then we speak in English , and I am patient with him . I discovered Giovanni a few weeks after I 'd arrived in Rome , thanks to that big Internet caf ? at the Piazza Barbarini , across the street from that fountain with the sculpture of that sexy merman blowing into his conch shell . He ( Giovanni , that is-not the merman ) had posted a flier on the bulletin board explaining that a native Italian speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right beside his appeal was another flier with the same request , word-for-word identical in every way , right down to the typeface . The only difference was the contact information . One flier listed an e-mail address for somebody named Giovanni ; the other introduced somebody named Dario . But even the home phone number was the same . // Using my keen intuitive powers , I e-mailed both men at the same time , asking in Italian , " Are you perhaps brothers ? " // It was Giovanni who wrote back this very provocativo message : " Even better . Twins ! " // Yes-much better . Tall , dark and handsome identical twenty-five-year-old twins , as it turned out , with those giant brown liquid-center Italian eyes that just unstitch me . After meeting the boys in person , I began to wonder if perhaps I should adjust my rule somewhat about remaining celibate this year . For instance , perhaps I could remain totally celibate except for keeping a pair of handsome twenty-five-year-old Italian twin brothers as lovers . Which was slightly reminiscent of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nonetheless ... I was already composing my letter to Penthouse : // In the flickering , candlelit shadows of the Roman caf ? , it was impossible to tell whose hands were caress-But , no. // No and no. // I chopped the fantasy off in mid-word . This was not my moment to be seeking romance and ( as day follows night ) to further complicate my already knotty life . This was my moment to look for the kind of healing and peace that can only come from solitude. // Anyway , by now , by the middle of November , the shy , studious Giovanni and I have become dear buddies . As for Dario-the more razzle-dazzle swinger brother of the two-I have introduced him to my adorable little Swedish friend Sofie , and how they 've been sharing their evenings in Rome is another kind of Tandem Exchange altogether . But Giovanni and I , we only talk . Well , we eat and we talk . We have been eating and talking for many pleasant weeks now , sharing pizzas and gentle grammatical corrections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new idioms and fresh mozzarella. // Now it is midnight and foggy , and Giovanni is walking me home to my apartment through these back streets of Rome , which meander organically around the ancient buildings like bayou streams snaking around shadowy clumps of cypress groves . Now we are at my door . We face each other . He gives me a warm hug . This is an improvement ; for the first few weeks , he would only shake my hand . I think if I were to stay in Italy for another three years , he might actually get up the juice to kiss me . On the other hand , he might just kiss me right now , tonight , right here by my door ... there 's still a chance ... I mean we 're pressed up against each other 's bodies beneath this moonlight ... and of course it would be a terrible mistake ... but it 's still such a wonderful possibility that he might actually do it right now ... that he might just bend down ... and ... and ... Nope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good night , my dear Liz , " he says . // " Buona notte , caro mio , " I reply . // I walk up the stairs to my fourth-floor apartment , all alone . I let myself into my tiny little studio , all alone . I shut the door behind me . Another solitary bedtime in Rome . Another long night 's sleep ahead of me , with nobody and nothing in my bed except a pile of Italian phrasebooks and dictionaries . // I am alone , I am all alone , I am completely alone . // Grasping this reality , I let go of my bag , drop to my knees and press my forehead against the floor . There , I offer up to the universe a fervent prayer of thanks . // First in English . // Then in Italian . // And then-just to get the point across-in Sanskrit. // Chapter Two And since I am already down there in supplication on the floor , let me hold that position as I reach back in time three years earlier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found me in this exact same posture : on my knees , on a floor , praying . // Everything else about the three-years-ago scene was different , though . That time , I was not in Rome but in the upstairs bathroom of the big house in the suburbs of New York which I 'd recently purchased with my husband . It was a cold November , around three o'clock in the morning . My husband was sleeping in our bed . I was hiding in the bathroom for something like the forty-seventh consecutive night , and-just as during all those nights before-I was sobbing . Sobbing so hard , in fact , that a great lake of tears and snot was spreading before me on the bathroom tiles , a veritable Lake Inferior ( if you will ) of all my shame and fear and confusion and grief . // I do n't want to be married anymore . // I was trying so hard not to know this , but the truth kept insisting itself to me. // I do n't want to be married anymore . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to have a baby . // But I was supposed to want to have a baby . I was thirty-one years old . My husband and I-who had been together for eight years , married for six-had built our entire life around the common expectation that , after passing the doddering old age of thirty , I would want to settle down and have children . By then , we mutually anticipated , I would have grown weary of traveling and would be happy to live in a big , busy household full of children and homemade quilts , with a garden in the backyard and a cozy stew bubbling on the stovetop . ( The fact that this was a fairly accurate portrait of my own mother is a quick indicator of how difficult it once was for me to tell the difference between myself and the powerful woman who had raised me . ) But I didn't-as I was appalled to be finding out-want any of these things . Instead , as my twenties had come to a close , that deadline of THIRTY had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that I did not want to be pregnant . I kept waiting to want to have a baby , but it did n't happen . And I know what it feels like to want something , believe me . I well know what desire feels like . But it was n't there . Moreover , I could n't stop thinking about what my sister had said to me once , as she was breast-feeding her firstborn : " Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face . You really need to be certain it 's what you want before you commit . " // How could I turn back now , though ? Everything was in place . This was supposed to be the year . In fact , we 'd been trying to get pregnant for a few months already . But nothing had happened ( aside from the fact that-in an almost sarcastic mockery of pregnancy-I was experiencing psychosomatic morning sickness , nervously throwing up my breakfast every day ) . And every month when I got my period I would find myself whispering furtively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you , thank you for giving me one more month to live ... I 'd been attempting to convince myself that this was normal . All women must feel this way when they 're trying to get pregnant , I 'd decided . ( " Ambivalent " was the word I used , avoiding the much more accurate description : " utterly consumed with dread " . ) I was trying to convince myself that my feelings were customary , despite all evidence to the contrary-such as the acquaintance I 'd run into last week who 'd just discovered that she was pregnant for the first time , after spending two years and a king 's ransom in fertility treatments . She was ecstatic . She had wanted to be a mother forever , she told me . She admitted she 'd been secretly buying baby clothes for years and hiding them under the bed , where her husband would n't find them . I saw the joy in her face and I recognized it . This was the exact joy my own face had radiated last spring , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to send me on assignment to New Zealand , to write an article about the search for giant squid . And I thought , " Until I can feel as ecstatic about having a baby as I felt about going to New Zealand to search for a giant squid , I can not have a baby " // I do n't want to be married anymore . // In daylight hours , I refused that thought , but at night it would consume me . What a catastrophe . How could I be such a criminal jerk as to proceed this deep into a marriage , only to leave it ? We 'd only just bought this house a year ago . Had n't I wanted this nice house ? Had n't I loved it ? So why was I haunting its halls every night now , howling like Medea ? Was n't I proud of all we 'd accumulated-the prestigious home in the Hudson Valley , the apartment in Manhattan , the eight phone lines , the friends and the picnics and the parties , the weekends spent roaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying ever more appliances on credit ? I had actively participated in every moment of the creation of this life-so why did I feel like none of it resembled me ? Why did I feel so overwhelmed with duty , tired of being the primary breadwinner and the housekeeper and the social coordinator and the dog-walker and the wife and the soon-to-be mother , and-somewhere in my stolen moments-a writer ... ? // I do n't want to be married anymore . // My husband was sleeping in the other room , in our bed . I equal parts loved him and could not stand him . I could n't wake him to share in my distress-what would be the point ? He 'd already been watching me fall apart for months now , watching me behave like a madwoman ( we both agreed on that word ) , and I only exhausted him . We both knew there was something wrong with me , and he 'd been losing patience with it . We 'd been fighting and crying , and we were weary in that way that only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the eyes of refugees . // The many reasons I did n't want to be this man 's wife anymore are too personal and too sad to share here . Much of it had to do with my problems , but a good portion of our troubles were related to his issues , as well . That 's only natural ; there are always two figures in a marriage , after all-two votes , two opinions , two conflicting sets of decisions , desires and limitations . But I do n't think it 's appropriate for me to discuss his issues in my book . Nor would I ask anyone to believe that I am capable of reporting an unbiased version of our story , and therefore the chronicle of our marriage 's failure will remain untold here . I also will not discuss here all the reasons why I did still want to be his wife , or all his wonderfulness , or why I loved him and why I had married him and why I was unable to imagine life without him . I wo n't open any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on this night , he was still my lighthouse and my albatross in equal measure . The only thing more unthinkable than leaving was staying ; the only thing more impossible than staying was leaving . I did n't want to destroy anything or anybody . I just wanted to slip quietly out the back door , without causing any fuss or consequences , and then not stop running until I reached Greenland . // This part of my story is not a happy one , I know . But I share it here because something was about to occur on that bathroom floor that would change forever the progression of my life-almost like one of those crazy astronomical super-events when a planet flips over in outer space for no reason whatsoever , and its molten core shifts , relocating its poles and altering its shape radically , such that the whole mass of the planet suddenly becomes oblong instead of spherical . Something like that . // What happened was that I started to pray . // You know-like , to God . // Chapter Three Now , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I have introduced that loaded word-GOD-into my book , and since this is a word which will appear many times again throughout these pages , it seems only fair that I pause here for a moment to explain exactly what I mean when I say that word , just so people can decide right away how offended they need to get . // Saving for later the argument about whether God exists at all ( no-here 's a better idea : let 's skip that argument completely ) , let me first explain why I use the word God , when I could just as easily use the words Jehovah , Allah , Shiva , Brahma , Vishnu or Zeus . Alternatively , I could call God " That " , which is how the ancient Sanskrit scriptures say it , and which I think comes close to the all-inclusive and unspeakable entity I have sometimes experienced . But that " That " feels impersonal to me-a thing , not a being-and I myself can not pray to a That . I need a proper name , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reason , when I pray , I do not address my prayers to The Universe , The Great Void , The Force , The Supreme Self , The Whole , The Creator , The Light , The Higher Power , or even the most poetic manifestation of God 's name , taken , I believe , from the Gnostic gospels : " The Shadow of the Turning " . // I have nothing against any of these terms . I feel they are all equal because they are all equally adequate and inadequate descriptions of the indescribable . But we each do need a functional name for this indescribability , and " God " is the name that feels the most warm to me , so that 's what I use . I should also confess that I generally refer to God as " Him " , which does n't bother me because , to my mind , it 's just a convenient personalizing pronoun , not a precise anatomical description or a cause for revolution . Of course , I do n't mind if people call God " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again-to me , these are both equal terms , equally adequate and inadequate . Though I do think the capitalization of either pronoun is a nice touch , a small politeness in the presence of the divine . // Culturally , though not theologically , I 'm a Christian . I was born a Protestant of the white Anglo-Saxon persuasion . And while I do love that great teacher of peace who was called Jesus , and while I do reserve the right to ask myself in certain trying situations what indeed He would do , I ca n't swallow that one fixed rule of Christianity insisting that Christ is the only path to God . Strictly speaking , then , I can not call myself a Christian . Most of the Christians I know accept my feelings on this with grace and open-mindedness . Then again , most of the Christians I know do n't speak very strictly . To those who do speak ( and think ) strictly , all I can do here is offer my regrets for any hurt feelings and now excuse myself from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcendent mystics of all religions . I have always responded with breathless excitement to anyone who has ever said that God does not live in a dogmatic scripture or in a distant throne in the sky , but instead abides very close to us indeed-much closer than we can imagine , breathing right through our own hearts . I respond with gratitude to anyone who has ever voyaged to the center of that heart , and who has then returned to the world with a report for the rest of us that God is an experience of supreme love . In every religious tradition on earth , there have always been mystical saints and transcendents who report exactly this experience . Unfortunately many of them have ended up arrested and killed . Still , I think very highly of them . // ( Continues ... ) //
