Worldcom investors are in a world of hurt . They should have listened to a dead analyst , not a live one . In fact , the WorldCom bankruptcy has a lot to teach us about analyzing companies , and now , as the markets are searching for a bottom , is a great time to put those lessons to use . <P> Not long ago , Jack Benjamin Grubman was on top of the world . The Salomon Smith Barney telecommunications analyst was pulling down $20 million a year , and every big investor knew Grubman was the " ax , " the one man who could make or break any stock in his industry with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down . Today Grubman is in the gutter . WorldCom was one of his favorite stocks . Investors are livid , and regulators are looking into whether he violated professional ethics by touting telecom stocks for the investment-banking fees they would earn for his firm . <P> I have a more basic beef with Grubman : I question not his ethics but his analysis . ( Since when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In congressional testimony , Grubman declared that the job of a stock analyst is " to make judgments about the future prospects of companies . " In other words , by projecting past growth rates and forecasting future trends , analysts like Grubman seek to figure out what a company will be worth down the road . <P> Benjamin Graham ( who died in 1976 ) would not have applauded Grubman . Graham  --  market-stomping money manager , finance professor at Columbia , mentor to Warren Buffett  --  was the greatest investment mind of the 20th century . <P> He insisted that the analyst 's job is , first and foremost , to figure out what a stock is worth right now . He believed in comparing a company 's share price to its existing assets and past earnings . Only after determining a stock 's value today would Graham entertain guesstimates of what it might earn tomorrow . Anchoring his analysis in reality gave Graham what he called " the margin of safety . " As he wrote in his classic The Intelligent Investor , " Operations for profit should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> How does this relate to Grubman ? His mistake was n't that he guessed wrong about WorldCom 's future ; the company was lying about its numbers . His mistake was that he ignored the present . <P> Even as WorldCom 's future kept looking rosier to Grubman ( see chart ) , its balance sheet , its " now , " was imploding . At the end of 1999 , the company claimed $10.3 billion in current assets and $30.3 billion in current liabilities and long-term debt . By year-end 2001 , current assets had shrunk to $9.2 billion , while current and long-term debt had swollen to $39.2 billion . Graham liked companies whose current assets were at least twice their current liabilities . This measure , called the current ratio , tells you the working-capital cushion a company has at its disposal . Graham also believed that long-term debt should not exceed working capital . WorldCom 's working capital sank to a negative $8 billion in 2000 even as its long-term debt was burgeoning  --  to more than $30 billion in 2001 . WorldCom was making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But Grubman kept hollering " buy , " all the way down to $6 a share . ( Grubman did not respond to my requests for comment ; a Salomon Smith Barney spokeswoman says Grubman " now admits that his thesis was wrong . " )
