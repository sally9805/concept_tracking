Franois Truffaut called them " privileged moments " : brief shots that offer snapshots of the soul in a glance or caress . A Very Long Engagement , Jean-Pierre Jeunet 's first film since the immensely popular and affecting Amlie , is full of those moments . In adapting Sbastien Japrisot 's novel set in World War I and its chaotic aftermath , Jeunet and writer Guillaume Laurant have taken virtually the whole book and thrown it onscreen at a breathless , speed-reading pace . A fabulous image will appear , hurtle into your busy brain , then give way to the next . <P> The story is simple enough . An innocent soldier , Manech ( Gaspard Ulliel ) , has been exiled to no-man's-land by his superiors and is presumed dead . His fianc  --  lovely , crippled Mathilde ( Amlie 's Audrey Tautou )  --  does all she can to find him . It 's a fable of the noblest obsession , reflected in Tautou 's poignant brown eyes . But it 's just a part of Jeunet 's grand , sad and comic panorama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Can a movie have too much good stuff ? Not when it 's stuffed like this one . A bayoneted German soldier dies , and we literally see his last breath . A flashback to the childhood of Mathilde and Manech shows that he already loved her back then : if the crippled girl wants to see the sea from the top of the local lighthouse , he 'll carry her up . <P> These and a hundred other privileges fight for your attention . So pay attention to this congested movie miracle . The headache it gives you will vanish soon enough ; it 's the heartbreak you 'll take home .  --  R.C.
