I am standing in line for Walt Disney 's It 's a Small World ride , holding my four-year-old daughter in my arms , trying to entertain her as the serpentine line of parents and children moves slowly toward the flat-bottomed boats emerging from the grotto to the music of an endless audio loop . Suddenly Annie jerks taut in my arms and points into the crowd . " Daddy ! I saw Mama ! Hurry ! " I do not look . I do n't ask where . I do n't because Annie 's mother died seven months ago . I stand motionless in the line , looking just like everyone else except for the hot tears that have begun to sting my eyes . Annie keeps pointing into the crowd , becoming more and more agitated . Even in Disney World , where periodic meltdowns are common , her fit draws stares . Clutching her struggling body against mine , I work my way back through the line , which sends her into outright panic . The green metal chutes double back upon themselves to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I push past countless staring families , finally reaching the relative openness between the Carousel and Dumbo . Holding Annie tighter , I rock and turn in slow circles as I did to calm her when she was an infant . A streaming mass of teenagers breaks around us like a river around a rock and pays us about as much attention . A claustrophobic sense of futility envelops me , a feeling I never experienced prior to my wife 's illness but which now dogs me like a malignant shadow . If I could summon a helicopter to whisk us back to the Polynesian Resort , I would pay ten thousand dollarsto do it . But there is no helicopter . Only us . Or the less-than-us that we 've been since Sarah died . The vacation is over . And when the vacation is over , you go home . But where is home ? Technically Houston , the suburb of Tanglewood . But Houston does n't feel like home anymore . The Houston house has a hole in it now . A hole that moves from room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people who know me . At thirty-eight years old , I have sent twelve men and women to death row . I watched nine of them die . I 've killed in defense of my family . I 've given up one successful career and made a greater success of another . I am admired by my friends , feared by my enemies , loved by those who matter . But in the face of my child 's grief , I am powerless . Taking a deep breath , I hitch Annie a little higher and begin the long trek back to the monorail . We came to Disney World because Sarah and I brought Annie here a year agobefore the diagnosisand it turned out to be the best vacation of our lives . I hoped a return trip might give Annie some peace . But the opposite has happened . She rises in the middle of the night and pads into the bathroom in search of Sarah ; she walks the theme parks with darting eyes , always alert for the vanished maternal profile . In the magical world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next corner as easily as Cinderella . When I patiently explained that this could not happen , she reminded me that Snow White rose from the dead just like Jesus , which in her four-year-old brain is indisputable fact . All we have to do is find Mama , so that Daddy can kiss her and make her wake up . I collapse onto a seat in the monorail with a half dozen Japanese tourists , Annie sobbing softly into my shoulder . The silver train accelerates to cruising speed , rushing through Tomorrowland , a grand anachronism replete with Jetsons-style rocket ships and Art Deco restaurants . A 1950s incarnation of man 's glittering destiny , Tomorrowland was outstripped by reality more rapidly than old Walt could have imagined , transformed into a kitschy parody of the dreams of the Eisenhower era . It stands as mute but eloquent testimony to man 's inability to predict what lies ahead . I do not need to be reminded of this . As the monorail swallows a long curve , I spy the crossed roof beams of the Polynesian Resort . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emptiness that haunts us every day . And all at once that is not good enough anymore . With shocking clarity a voice speaks in my mind . It is Sarah 's voice . You ca n't do this alone , she says . I look down at Annie 's face , angelic now in sleep . " We need help , " I say aloud , drawing odd glances from the Japanese tourists . Before the monorail hisses to a stop at the hotel , I know what I am going to do . I call Delta Airlines first and book an afternoon flight to Baton Rougenot our final destination , but the closest major airport to it . Simply making the call sets something thrumming in my chest . Annie awakens as I arrange for a rental car , perhaps even in sleep sensing the utter resolution in her father 's voice . She sits quietly beside me on the bed , her left hand on my thigh , reassuring herself that I can go nowhere without her . " Are we going on the airplane again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I answer , dialing a Houston number . " Back home ? " " No , we 're going to see Gram and Papa . " Her eyes widen with joyous expectation . " Gram and Papa ? Now ? " " I hope so . Just a minute . " My assistant , Cilia Daniels , is speaking in my ear . She obviously saw the name of the hotel on the caller-ID unit and started talking the moment she picked up . I break in before she can get rolling . " Listen to me , Cil . I want you to call a storage company and lease enough space for everything in the house . " " The house ? " she echoes . " Your house ? You mean everything ' as in furniture ? " " Yes . I 'm selling the house . " " Selling the house . Penn , what 's happened ? What 's wrong ? " " Nothing . I 've come to my senses , that 's all . Annie 's never going to get better in that house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're making things worse . I 'm moving back home for a while . " " Home ? " " To Natchez . " " Natchez . " " Mississippi . Where I lived before I married Sarah ? Where I grew up ? " " I know that , but " " Do n't worry about your salary . I 'll need you now more than ever . " " I 'm not worried about my salary . I 'm worried about you . Have you talked to your parents ? Your mother called yesterday and asked for your number down there . She sounded upset . " " I 'm about to call them . After you get the storage space , call some movers and arrange transport . Let Sarah 's parents have anything they want out of the house . Then call Jim Noble and tell him to sell the place . And I do n't mean list it , I mean sell it . " " The housing market 's pretty soft right now . Especially in your bracket . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " There 's an odd silence . Then Cilla says , " Could I make you an offer on it ? I wo n't if you never want to be reminded of the place . " " No ... it 's fine . You need to get out of that condo . Can you come anywhere close to a realistic price ? " " I 've got quite a bit left from my divorce settlement . You know me . " " Do n't make me an offer . I 'll make you one . Get the house appraised , then knock off twenty percent . No realtor fees , no down payment , nothing . Work out a payment schedule over twenty years at , say ... six percent interest . That way we have an excuse to stay in touch . " " Oh , God , Penn , I ca n't take advantage like that . " " It 's a done deal . " I take a deep breath , feeling the invisible bands that have bound me loosening . " Well ... that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop because you run off to Disney World . " " Do I want to hear this ? " " I 've got bad news and news that could go either way . " " Give me the bad . " " Arthur Lee Hanratty 's last request for a stay was just denied by the Supreme Court . It ' s leading on CNN every half hour . The execution is scheduled for midnight on Saturday . Five days from now . " " That 's good news , as far as I 'm concerned . " Cilla sighs in a way that tells me I 'm wrong . " Mr. Givens called a few minutes ago . " Mr. Givens and his wife are the closest relatives of the black family slaughtered by Hanratty and his psychotic brothers . " And Mr. Givens does n't ever want to see Hanratty in person again . He and his wife want you to attend in their place . A witness they can trust . You know the drill . " " Too well . " Lethal injection at the Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seventy miles north of Houston , the seventh circle of Hell . " I really do n't want to see this one , Cil . " " I know . I do n't know what to tell you . " " What 's this other news ? " " I just got off the phone with Peter . " Peter Highsmith is my editor , a gentleman and scholar , but not the person I want to talk to just now . " He would never say anything , but I think the house is getting anxious about Nothing But the Truth . You 're nearly a year past your deadline . Peter is more worried about you than about the book . He just wants to know you 're okay . " " What did you tell him ? " " That you 've had a tough time , but you 're finally waking back up to life . You 're nearly finished with the book , and it 's by far the best you 've ever written . " I laugh out loud . " How close are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got up the nerve to ask you about it . " I start to lie , but there 's no point . " I have n't written a decent page since Sarah died . " Cilla is silent . " And I burned the first half of the manuscript the night before we left Houston . " She gasps . " You did n't ! " " Look in the fireplace . " " Penn ... I think you need some help . I 'm speaking as your friend . There are some good people here in town . Discreet . " " I do n't need a shrink . I need to take care of my daughter . " " Well ... whatever you do , be careful , okay ? " " A lot of good that does . Sarah was the most careful person I ever knew . " " I did n't mean " " I know . Look , I do n't want a single journalist finding out where I am . I want no part of that deathwatch circus . It ' s Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney of Harris County , and my old boss . " As far as you know , I 'm on vacation until the moment of the execution . " " Consider yourself incommunicado . " " I 've got to run . We 'll talk soon . " " Make sure we do . " When I hang up , Annie rises to her knees beside me , her eyes bright . " Are we really going to Gram and Papa 's ? " " We 'll know in a minute . " I dial the telephone number I memorized as a four-year-old and listen to it ring . The call is answered by a woman with a cigarette-parched Southern drawl no film producer would ever use , for fear that the audience would be unable to decode the words . She works for an answering service . " Dr. Cage 's residence . " " This is Penn Cage , his son . Can you ring through for me ? " " We sure can , honey . You hang on . " After five rings , I hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somehow convey more emotional subtext than most men could in two paragraphs : reassurance , gravitas , a knowledge of ultimate things . " Doctor Cage , " it says . My father 's voice instantly steadies my heart . This voice has comforted thousands of people over the years , and told many others that their days on earth numbered far less than they 'd hoped . " Dad , what are you doing home this time of day ? " " Penn ? Is that you ? " " Yes . " " What 's up , son ? " " I 'm bringing Annie home to see you . " " Great . Are you coming straight from Florida ? " " You could say that . We 're coming today . " " Today ? Is she sick ? " " No . Not physically , anyway . Dad , I 'm selling the house in Houston and moving back home for a while . What comes after that , I 'll figure out later . Have you got room for us ? " " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear my father shout , then the clicking of heels followed by my mother 's voice . " Penn ? Are you really coming home ? " " We 'll be there tonight . " " Thank God . We 'll pick you up at the airport . " " No , do n't . I 'll rent a car . " " Oh ... all right . I just ... I ca n't tell you how glad I am . " Something in my mother 's voice triggers an alarm . I ca n't say what it is , because it 's in the spaces , not the words , the way you hear things in families . Whatever it is , it 's serious . Peggy Cage does not worry about little things . " Mom ? What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . I 'm just glad you 're coming home . " There is no more inept liar than someone who has spent a lifetime telling the truth . " Mom , do n't try to " " We 'll talk when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she belongs . " I recall Cilla 's opinion that my mother was upset when she called yesterday . But there 's no point in forcing the issue on the phone . I 'll be face to face with her in a few hours . " We 'll be there tonight . Bye . " My hand shakes as I set the receiver in its cradle . For a prodigal son , a journey home after eighteen years is a sacred one . I 've been home for a few Christmases and Thanksgivings , but this is different . Looking down at Annie , I get one of the thousand-volt shocks of recognition that has hit me so many times since the funeral . Sometimes Sarah 's face peers out from Annie 's as surely as if her spirit has temporarily possessed the child . But if this is a possession , it is a benign one . Annie 's hazel eyes transfix mine with a look that gave me much peace when it shone from Sarah 's face : This is the right thing , it says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love you more , " I reply , completing our ritual . Then I catch her under the arms and lift her high into the air . " Let 's pack ! We 've got a plane to catch ! "
