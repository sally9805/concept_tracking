The U.S. government has spent four years and more than $135 million building a case in federal court that cigarette makers profited over the course of a half-century by lying to the American public about the dangers of smoking and racking up generations of addicts in the process . The proposed penalty  --  $130 billion  --  would pay for a recovery program for every cigarette addict in the U.S. for the next 25 years . <P> When the Justice Department abruptly changed course last week , reducing the penalty sought to $10 billion , critics cried foul , charging it was a reflection of the Administration 's ties to the tobacco industry , including a Justice Department with a handful of high-level political appointees who used to belong to law firms that represented Big Tobacco . " The public has to be on the lookout for clandestine negotiations , " says Matthew Myers , a witness in the case and president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids . <P> But speculation that politics was behind the move is " exactly wrong , " a career Justice Department prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught off guard in February by a circuit-court ruling that severely limited the payout they could seek from Big Tobacco , said Justice Department officials . Under the racketeering statutes cited in the case , the government could not recommend a penalty for any past wrongdoing and instead was restricted to proposals geared to prevent and restrain future action . Prosecutors scrambled to adjust their case . The solution , based on recommendations by longtime Justice lawyers , was to ask the court to demand an initial $10 billion payment , then appoint a monitor to review the behavior of the industry and recommend a suitable penalty every year until the cigarette makers stop their misdeeds . Ted Wells , a lawyer for Philip Morris USA , calls the plan a " last-minute , desperate attempt " to save the case . But Justice lawyers say that far from staging a retreat , they are betting on the " virtual certainty " that the tobacco industry wo n't change its ways in one year and thus will be liable for steep penalties for years to come .  --  By Brian Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
