Near the town of Coldwater in Tate County , Miss. , where the kudzu hills rise gently from the Delta flatlands in the west , there 's a gravel track that runs through stands of scrub oak and pine to reach a dusty clearing : two single-wide trailers , a small vegetable patch , a bluetick hound sleeping in the lee of a faded green Lincoln . Music is in the air  --  the fierce , hypnotic boogie known as hill-country blues  --  because this is the headquarters of the North Mississippi Allstars . <P> A hot little blues-rock band that 's bringing the sound of the Mississippi hills to a brand-new audience , the Allstars are three men in their 20s , two of them white and one black : Luther Dickinson , who sings and plays snaky slide guitar ; his brother Cody , a monstrously talented drummer ; and their friend Chris Chew , who adds fleet-fingered bass and the vocal harmonies he learned at the Rising Sun Baptist Church in nearby Hernando . The Allstars spend most of their time on the road ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past 18 months alone ) , fusing the punkish energy of juke-joint blues with rock-guitar solos and hip-hop beats  --  and getting neo-hippie kids twirling to old Mississippi Fred McDowell tunes and hard-core kids moshing and crowd surfing to primal Robert Johnson licks . Their debut CD , a raucous collection of hill-country standards called Shake Hands with Shorty , is generating ecstatic reviews , and though purists complain that the Allstars play adulterated blues , most folks in north Mississippi ( and on college campuses ) are n't interested in museum-ready music . They 'd rather dance . <P> It 's a muggy Tuesday afternoon , and electric blues is pumping out of a ramshackle red barn that sits in the weeds 50 yards beyond the Dickinsons ' trailer homes . Outside the barn , a few people are drinking beer and swapping tall tales about mysterious guitar pickers and the talismanic powers of black-cat bones . Inside , Luther and Cody are jamming with two legendary blues families : the sons and grandsons of R.L. Burnside , 72 , and of the late David ( " Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the walls , a gallery of American icons  --  Betty Page , Casey Jones , Father Flanagan , Mississippi John Hurt  --  keep watch as Cody , a skinny 24-year-old with Prince Valiant hair and a powerful chest , works a zebra-striped drum kit . With his mouth open , head cocked and eyes scrunched in an expression of mind-bending wonder , he sets up a martial beat taken from the fife-and-drum bands that have been playing in these hills since the Civil War , then dances around it with virtuoso rock and jazz accents . Luther , 27 , his soft features framed by thick black curls , finger picks his Gibson hollow body and uses a bottleneck slide to make it skitter and howl . Garry Burnside locks in to the groove on bass ( Chew is off working today , driving a truck for Williams-Sonoma ) , David Kimbrough Jr . adds a slinky guitar part , and Kenny Kimbrough wails on a conga . The instruments chase each other around the barn , hanging on a single chord and repeating a riff over and over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dirt . This is trance music  --  the kind of sonic moonshine that has been served up for decades in the juke joints of north Mississippi  --  and it raises a question : How did these shaggy Dickinson kids learn to play it so well ?
