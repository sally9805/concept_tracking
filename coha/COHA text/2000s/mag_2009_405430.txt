As Do the Right Thing turns 20 this month , its director looks back . Spike Lee will now take your questions . What impact would you say that Do the Right Thing had on race relations in America ? Aqeel Kameelah FORT LAUDERDALE , FLA . Well , it did n't end it . Laughs . I do n't know what film will be able to do that . I think maybe a better question might be , Can you still do films today dealing with race in the so-called , quote-unquote , postracial world we live in ? I do n't even know what that is when people say that . It would be a different movie , but I do n't think that subject matter has been exhausted . Do people still ask you why Mookie threw the garbage can through the window at the end of the movie ? Jason Geller NEW YORK CITY Not as much . It has died down somewhat after 20 years . What we wanted to do is to have people have serious discussions and debates about this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the intent from the beginning . How do you respond to young people , especially with the election of Barack Obama , who believe racism is not as significant as it was for older generations ? Martin Zacharia , CHICAGO It might not be as significant , but it still has significance . I will admit that younger people have different attitudes about race than their parents and grandparents , but race is still with us today , and it 's going to be a while before it 's totally eradicated . That 's why I still have issues with this term postracial society , which is not the case at all . Has there ever been a topic that you wanted to make into a movie but did not or could not because of certain cultural or financial constraints ? Marie Fatil , MIAMI The constraint has been money . It 's always money . I wanted to do a biopic on Jackie Robinson . I want to do a biopic on Joe Louis and Max Schmeling . I want to do a biopic on James Brown . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make money on it , they 're not going to give you the money . Simple as that . Are there any other African-American figures whose story you want to make into a movie ? Taffany McElvine CHANDLER , ARIZ . I would love to do one on Harriet Tubman . I think maybe one day a slave epic . Apart from Roots , which was on television , I do n't think there 's been a serious film dealing with slavery in this country . It would need alternative means of finance . It 's not something that you could get made through the traditional Hollywood system . Are you conscious of the doors you 've opened for many African-American actors , and do you plan to continue to cast new faces in upcoming projects ? Elise Woodson LOS ANGELES Oh , yeah . What she 's talking about did n't happen by accident . That was the plan , to give young , talented people -- and not just black -- a chance . And not just in front of the camera but behind the camera too . It 's all part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make ? Nachi Kamatkar PITTSBURGH , PA . Here goes two . The first one : She 's Got ta Have It . The next one would be Malcolm X ; the pressure was on Denzel Washington , who played the title character and me to do that . We did n't have a lot of money to do it . How important to you are the critics ' reviews of your films ? Do you still look at them or care ? Jeffrey N. Golub , SEATTLE There are some very well educated critics in cinema , people who can write who understand cinema . Unfortunately , those people are the minority . So there are reviews that I do read . No one I want to name right now . Are there any up-and-coming American filmmakers you admire ? Cathy Collins , LOUISVILLE , KY . There 's this new film coming out called Black Dynamite , which is a spoof of the black-exploitation films . It 's by a young African American , Scott Sanders . Everybody should look out for this film . It 's hilarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think the Knicks are going to win a championship anytime soon ? Kathleen Jill , BROOKLYN , N.Y . If we get LeBron James after next season , we 're definitely going to get a ring . Within two or three years , the Knicks are going to be world champions .
