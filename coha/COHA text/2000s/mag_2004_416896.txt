/2005 MY MOTHER STARTED MAKING ARRANGEMENTS AS soon as she got out of the hospital . She made an appointment to go to the lawyer and I drove her there . We parked right in front of the lawyer 's office and I helped her out of the car and up onto the sidewalk . She had a cane and was n't used to it . She signed a will . It started off saying how she was " of sound and disposing mind and memory " and not acting " under duress of any person . " She was n't under duress of another person ; she was under duress of being sick . She had had a tumor taken out of her . She told the lawyer what to do about her savings and will and retirement . She made a living trust so if she became incapacitated or incompetent-those were the lawyer 's words-all of us kids could write checks and have power of attorney and medical attorney . A couple months later I was talking to my aunt on the phone . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surgery . When we started talking about them coming to visit again I said they ought to come soon . My aunt did n't say anything for a second , then she said , she said it reluctantly , " Have you thought about funeral arrangements ? " When I had packed to come down to my mother 's that time , the way I had been doing for months , I had packed clothes I could wear to a funeral because I was going to stay " for the duration " we called it , that is , until my mother died . My mother had told us she wanted to be cremated . The hospice people had said it was better if you could fill out the paperwork in advance . We filled out what we could , everything except the time of death , which we had to wait for . It felt terrible to wait for that , as if we wanted it to happen . I do n't remember when I stopped hoping my mother would remain alive . I go over and over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if by thinking differently , as if by my remembering what was not I can remake or change what happened . I think " what if- , " " what if- , " " if only- . " I could n't see her dying then . I only see her start to die in retrospect . In retrospect she dies over and over again . I do n't remember if there was one day or a certain incident or something someone said or if it was just a gradual slip from actively hoping because I believed , to not allowing myself to think because I was afraid , to realizing that the arrangements we were making were not for her recovery but for final things . SOMETIMES WHEN I WENT TO see HER I CAUGHT A van at the airport . The van took me to a mall then I waited there for an hour or so until another van got me . It went via all these other little towns and places that were n't even towns , just gas stations or rest stops and people would be waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-there were only a few rows-because I did n't want to talk to anyone . Sometimes I 'd listen to tapes and look out the window . It was beautiful : wide , clear skies , rich orange and red and blue and purple sunsets . Rarely cloudy . I could feel hot dry air when the driver opened the door to let someone in or out . When I got to my mother 's house it was almost night . I got my bags and paid the driver and walked up the driveway . The porch light was on and through the slats in the living room curtain I could see her sitting on the couch . Before , she would have met me at the airport or come outside and waved when she heard the van drive up , but she did n't anymore . The front door was ajar . I pushed it open with my bags and said , " Hey Mom ! " She was standing up by then , as if she 'd tried to walk to the door to meet me , but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half sitting against the arm of the couch . She was trembling . I dropped my bags and I put my arms around her . " You 're shaking , " I said . The way she shook it felt like holding a bird . " Mom , are you cold ? Can I get you something ? " " Oh no , I 'm just fine , " she said . I was wearing a T-shirt . She was wearing a sweater . It was yellow and orange and blue and she looked small in it . We sat on the couch and she asked me about my trip . I said it was fine , all right . I 'd taken it several times by now , but she liked to hear about the other people in the van , about the places we 'd dropped them off , or what the sky looked like when we were on the drive . Photograph // She 'd wanted to stay up to see me in , but she needed to sleep . I helped her into her nightgown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't shaking anymore . I told her to call me if she needed help , then I kneeled down beside the bed and kissed her goodnight . THEY SAID SHE WOULD N'T GO BALD BUT OF course she did . When she brushed her hair ir came out so she started using a comb . She combed it as gently as she could but still it came out , first strands of it then handfuls then clumps of it like a rabbit or a cat . It was on her pillow and sheets when she woke up in the morning . It was on the towel she used after her bath . It was around the bathtub and in the dryer filter , the back of her chair , the collars of her clothes . They said it would grow back as soft as a baby 's . She started wearing those winter ski caps she had lying around . There was a dark green one and a navy one and several others . They were some poly-cotton blend you could buy at Kmart three in a pack like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the wash . She 'd had them for the occasions when she 'd had to run out in the snow for the post or fill the bird feeder , and also for the times when we came home because we never had hats and she wanted us not to get cold . Her friend who used to cut her hair gave her a catalogue from which she could order hats . It was a mail-order clothing company started by a cancer survivor who wanted other women to be able to have nice-looking headwear . In the catalogue pictures they looked like normal women who might have cancer , white and black middle-aged women . They were n't perfectly shaped girls in their twenties or models . They looked confident and strong and they smiled strong , serious smiles . They looked like they decided , by gum , to beat this damned thing and that they had . A few of them actually were bald . Their faces were smooth and there was that eerie look on their skin when it has no hair , but they all were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or puffy cheeks from chemo or that yellow-orange look . None of them had oozy gums or looked like they were about to vomit blood . The hats were all natural fabrics , cotton and wool , and natural dyes and colors . There were dense , heavy weaves for winter and light , airy ones for summer . The styles had been inspired by traditional designs that the catalogue described : a Breton peasant woman 's beret , an Elizabethan ladies ' cap , an Australian outback hat with flap , etc. , as if you might wear one even if you were n't bald . For years my mother and I had gone clothes shopping together for me : back-to-school outfits when I was a kid , a nice coat or sweater for Christinas when I was in college . But we never shopped together for her until she got sick . We looked at the catalogue and talked about the colors and styles , which ones looked like her and which ones were definitely not her . We laughed about some of them . She did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the simple , classic ones . We talked about what she could wear at home and what she would like to wear when she went out as if she would go out again . We talked about how many to get , how long it would take for her hair to grow back . She liked one of the berets , but only if they had it in light blue , not the peachy color it was in the photo . The cap with the brim would be nice but only in cotton , not wool , because that would make her itch . She wondered if they were stretchy and if you could throw them in the wash or had to hand wash or get them dry-cleaned . We ordered several of them . My mother hoped they would arrive before my brother did on his next visit . She said she did n't want to have to wear one of those old ski caps for him and she certainly did n't want him to see her bald . We have pictures of her at Christmas . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . There 's a glass of her Gatorade on the table beside her and she 's wearing her dark green Kmart ski cap . The ones we ordered from the catalogue slipped down her smooth shiny head to her browless eyes and did n't keep their shape so she went back to ski caps . When we took them off they were full of flakes and patches of skin . Her skin , despite all the creams and lotions we put on it , was flaking off too . After she quit the chemo , her hair started coming back . By the time she died , her head was covered with light blonde hair as soft as a baby 's . MY MOTHER USED TO TAKE LONG , HOT BATHS . SHE 'D take a paperback , close the door and sit in the tub for what seemed like hours and read what she called her bathtub books , mysteries by Agatha Christie , Ngaio Marsh , Dorothy Sayers , Tony Hillerman . She did n't like the violent ones or the ones with sex . She liked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd learn something about English vdlage life between the wars , Aztec history , Flemish food , or Navajo spirituality . She always knew the end before it happened . When she got out of the tub her skin looked pink and soft . Even if it was early , like 7 o'clock , she 'd get into her bathrobe and sit down and watch TV with me or clip and file her fingernails or read or talk with me . One time when my sister , who was an art history major , came home from college , I took a picture of her sitting on the toilet , her head in her hand like Rodin 's " Thinker , " and Mom in the tub beside her , reading a mystery novel . They knew I was taking the picture and they tried not to laugh . We all thought it was hysterical . My brother was away at college , too , and I was still in high school . I was living alone with my mother in a studio apartment . My mother 's hair is long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became hard for my mother to bathe herself I helped her . At first I sat in the bathroom with her . I sat on the floor and washed her back and thinning hair and I helped her get in and out of the tub and I dried her . Her hair was falling out and her skin was becoming so loose from the weight she was losing . Along her arms where they had drawn her blood and put in the chemo were bruises . They were purple and yellow when they got old , but blue and dark when they were new . At first I would help her get in and out . She would hold on to my arm and the side of the tub and lower herself in slowly and I would help her . One time I offered to read to her in the tub but she said not to . Her reading in the tub when we were kids was as much about getting away from us as it was about reading . Now she was glad to have us , the children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm grateful you 're here , " she said to me . Once she said , " I feel sorry for people who do n't have daughters . " Sometimes we sat and did nothing at all . She sat and soaked and put in more hot when the temperature cooled and swirled it in around her . We brought her bubble bath and oils and mineral salts . We got her sea sponges and a blow-up terry cloth pillow to lie back on . When she was finished I 'd her help her stand and step from the tub and dry her and help her put her nightie on . Later there was the porta cath that you had to be very careful around . You had to keep it dry and clean . Then later , when she was no longer able to get up if she sat down , we got her a bath seat and installed a moveable showerhead . Finally we washed her with sponges in bed . We would remove her wet diaper and wipe her with a baby wipe and put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotion on . Some of the time she looked at us , but most of the time her eyes were away or closed . Sometimes she would moan and we would think she was trying to say something then this too stopped . ONE NIGHT WHEN I HAD GONE BACK HOME FOR A FEW days , my sister called me on the cordless phone from Mom 's backyard . We were doing this more because we never knew when she would wake up and hear us and we were saying things we did n't want her to hear . Sometimes it seemed her hearing had gotten more acute . She 'd hear things we did n't think she could . Sometimes she heard things the rest of us could n't . My sister had brought the cordless phone a few months earlier because if Mom heard the phone ring , she would n't just let it ring or take a message , she 'd try to run for it . In any event , she did n't get to use the cordless much . It was late when my sister called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could picture her out back under the dark New Mexico sky , the huge white stars far above her . I wondered if she had the cigarettes . Neither of us really smoked anymore , but one night when Mom was back in the hospital , we 'd driven home via the drive-thru liquor store , which we totally loved the idea of because it was so horrible , and got a six-pack of Corona and some cigarettes , something really shitty like Merit Lights , and taken them , home to Mom 's and gone out back and smoked and drank and were bad girls together . There was something about smoking together-while our mother who had smoked a couple packs a day until her fifties and was lying tonight in a hospital bed across town dying of cancer-that was like giving the finger and saying " fuck you " to the cancer . It was a stupid thing to do , but it let us get loud and laugh and feel better for a while . So my sister was calling me from where we 'd gotten loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom to bed then gone to bed herself but before she was asleep Mom called her and she went into Mom 's room and Mom said , slightly perturbed , but matter-of-fact , " Will you please take that monkey out of my room ? " There was a monkey chattering on her night table and it was keeping her awake . I do n't know if my sister tried to tell our mother that there was no monkey , or if my sister acted like she saw it , if she picked it up or coaxed it away with a peanut or a toy , or if she trapped it or chased it or whatever you would do with a monkey , but after a while the monkey left and my mother said now she was finally going to get some sleep . Our mother was on a ton of drugs , more and more of them as things went on : pain meds , narcotics , dope . But seeing the monkey was more than the drugs . It made us understand that her brain stem was shutting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less and less . The world she needed to know of was another . It was a world we could not understand or go to and she was going there without us . SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT THERE . Once her voice went high like a child 's voice . Though she was old and bald and her skin hung loose and her cheeks sunk over her toothless mouth , she suddenly sat up and said , in a singsong voice like a girl playing hideand-seek , " Where are you ? " Then with sudden strength , she pushed herself up from her pillows , threw the covers back and swung out her pale , skinny legs from the bed and shot to the floor . I did n't stop her . I followed her . " Where are you ? " She looked around the bed . " Where are you ? " " I 'm here , " I said , " beside you . " She kept moving as if she had n't heard me . She dashed to the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked behind the bookshelf . " Are you here ? " " I 'm beside you , " I said . She laughed , " Not you ! " then went on breezily . " I know where you are . " Then she said again in that child 's voice , " Where are you ? Where are you ? " I followed her as she scurried around her room . Her nightgown was loose around her . Every day she was losing more weight . She opened and closed the bedroom door . " Are you there ? Are you there ? Where are you ? " My mother was back in her childhood . I tried to imagine her there , a girl in the 1930s playing hide-and-seek with her sisters . Later when she could not get out of bed , she asked me once , " Who are all these people coming to help me ? " " Jo Marie ? " I said , naming one of her hospice nurses . " No . " She sounded puzzled . " Michael ? " Another nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hairless skin looked soft . " Who are all these people coming to help me ? " I named the rest of her nurses , then her doctors and neighbors and friends . None of them were who she meant . After a while she got quiet and we just sat there . She was staring intently , seeing something . " It 's Daddy , " she said . " It 's Daddy and other people I do n't know . They 're coming to help me . " My mother 's father , whom she had always loved , had died nearly 30 years before . A few weeks earlier , when my mother still had periods of lucidity , my brother had sat beside her bed and she had told him she 'd been dreaming of her father . She dreamt her father was standing near , in front of her . He did n't say anything , just smiled . She said she thought he was waiting for her . I want to think that how her dying looked to us , the trembling and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , but that some other part of her was helped by something kind . Perhaps it was her father who came to help . SHE BECAME VERY RESTLESS AT NIGHT . HER DOCTORS gave her drugs for this and I gave them to her with her other meds and talked to her until she was calm then told her goodnight and tucked her in and turned out the light and stayed with her until she slept . I sat by her bed in her father 's chair until I heard her breathing evenly . Then I went to the living room to read or to bed in my room across the hall . I kept the light on in the hall the way she 'd done for me when I was young . I kept open the door to her room so I could hear her . Sometimes in her sleep she 'd twitch or jolt or cry out loud and I would jump from the couch or stumble from bed and run and try to soothe her . " It 's OK , Mom , I 'm here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand or smooth her brow and talk to her quietly until she settled down . Sometimes as soon as I touched her she would be calm again . One night she kept waking up . I 'd stay with her until she seemed OK again then I would go back to bed , but then just as I was drifting off , she 'd whimper or cry or weep again and I would run across the hall again and touch her arm and tell her it was OK again until she settled down . After this happened several times , I brought the blankets from my bed into her room . I laid them down on the floor beside her bed and whenever she jolted or shouted I reached up to her and touched her arm and said , " It 's OK , Mom , it 's OK , " and she would rest . I slept on her floor like that for days . I remember lying in the dark and seeing , in the dim light from the hall , the tops of the medicine bottles lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a kid and waking up and seeing her there with a glass of water or warm wet wash cloth or whatever it was I needed . I remember the shape of her body in the bed . Sometimes , when 1 could only dimly see , she did n't look sick , she only looked , with the even rise and fall of her breath , like someone sleeping . But other times her breath was short and ragged and I could see and hear her hands twitch over the edge of the sheet as if she was looking for something . I would see the shine of sweat on her face as she gurgled and gasped and held her breath . I 'd count to 10 or 20 and become afraid . Then I would hold my breath too as if to better hear when she would breathe again then I would be relieved . The nurses said this was Cheyne-Stokes respiration . They said that it began before the end . They said they often died when they were sleeping . ONE MORNING SHF , WOKE UP WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Is everything ready ? " My brother and I were with her . We 'd been watching her sleep . Her skin was shiny , her eyes were bright , her hands were scrabbling across the sheet . " Is everything ready ? " she asked again . Her voice was livelier than it had been tor days , impatient as a child . " Is everything ready ? " " Yeah , " my brother said . " Everything 's ready , Mom . " " Oh good . " She sounded relieved . When she lay back against the pillows she looked old again . She did n't have her dentures in . I fluffed the pillows around her . " Good ... " she kept saying , " good ... " Then she drifted off , then just stared . Her eyes were cloudy and her hands were limp on the sheet , then suddenly she sat up again and was doing that scrabbling thing with her hands . " Is everything ready ? Is everything ready ? " She sounded frantic . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking in short , quick sentences . " Everything 's ready , Mom . Everything 's taken care of , " my brother said . I straightened her cap and wiped her face clean with a baby wipe . I put my hand on her forearm and her twitching slowed . " Yeah , Mom . Everything 's all taken care of . You do n't have to worry about anything . " She looked relieved again for a second then got that blank look again then suddenly almost shouted , " Ready to go ? " My brother was with her right away . " Ready when you are ! " He said this cheerily , the way she used to sound when we were young and eager to be going away to a movie or a park or a baseball game of my brother 's or a road trip . She used to make our road trips , when she would drive us across the country to follow our father 's work , into games . We 'd play the License Plate Game or Road Signs or Scenery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been for her . I did n't know how liberated , how happy , she later felt when she was able to go on driving trips to places she wanted to see , not just to follow our father . " You bet ready , Mom , " my brother said again . " Everything 's ready ! " " When . " She said it more like a statement than a question . " Whenever you want , Mom ! " Now I was sounding cheery too , the way you do with a baby to make them feel safe even though they do n't understand what you 're saying . " Yeah , Mom . Whenever you want is fine by us , " my brother said . " ... How about Saturday ? " she said . " Saturday ? You wan na go Saturday , Mom ? " She looked at us . Her eyes were wide . " Saturday OK with you ? " my brother asked me . " You bet , " I said . " Everything 's taken care of . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty is gon na come home with me and Chris- " " Who ? " These names of her cat and my partner , names from recently in her life , were puzzling to her . " Everything 's fine , " my brother jumped in . " We 're all ready when you are . " " Are we all packed ? " My brother looked at me . " You 're packed , Mom . But all of us are n't going , just you . But you 've got everything you need . " " Oh , thank you ... There wo n't be so much traffic on Saturday ... " " Whenever you want , Mom . Saturday would be fine . " This took place on a Wednesday or a Thursday , I ca n't remember exactly , but at least a couple days before Saturday . Everyone thought she would be dead by then . My brother and I were acting as if , were hoping , when she talked to us like this , that on some level our mother understood that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had always worried , especially after our father left , about us feeling abandoned . She worried about money , about how to support us . She did n't want us to feel alone or left . We hoped , we wanted to believe , that we could let her know she did n't need to worry about us anymore , that she could leave . We wanted to believe she could , somehow , decide or have some choice about the time , that her dying could be good , in her right time . We wanted to believe there was some thing that she could know and that she was trying to tell us . She did n't die that Saturday . She lived days longer than anybody thought . Then when she died it was not peacefully or easy , it was hard . As long as she tried to put it off , and though we had told her we were ready , we were not . Sidebar <p>                  @ @ @
