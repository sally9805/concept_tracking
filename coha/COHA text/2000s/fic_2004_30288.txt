Chapter One I did n't want to write a book with a hero and a villain , but Sontag kept making it hard for me . She is not a likable writer-but then she does n't intend to be . She 's elitist and condescending toward those less informed than she is ( i.e. , everybody ) and gratingly unapologetic about it . Intimidation , which I 'll grant is an indispensable critical weapon , she uses remorselessly . So does Kael . The difference is that Sontag uses it charmlessly-but then she does n't intend to be charming . ( Charm , she almost seems to feel , is for pipsqueaks . ) All that erudition impresses me , though there 's a big difference , as anyone who 's hung out with academics can tell you , between erudition and insight , erudition and taste . But my quarrel with Sontag is n't about her generally impeccable taste , and you would have to be crazy to say she lacks insight-her criticism is brilliant . I 'm getting off on the wrong foot by even using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a critic I revere , a magnificent critic . When I complain about her , you should keep in mind the caveat Nietzsche proffered once at the end of a ( much more bitter ) attack on Wagner : " When I use harsh words against the cretinism of Bayreuth , the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians . Other musicians do n't count compared to Wagner . " Obviously I ca n't be that categorical , since for me there is one critic who counts compared to Sontag , and though my aim in putting them side by side is to illuminate the work of each , honesty and ethics command me to admit right here what will be obvious anyway , which is that I do n't feel the same way about them . I revere Sontag . I love Kael . Loved . I met her when I was a young man just out of college who knew her work practically by heart ; she was near sixty , and over the twenty-three years she had left , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I 've had the opportunity more than once . Her voice does n't draw me as Kael 's voice did ; in fact it frequently puts me off . In my scale of enthusiasms , Kael 's humanity and her virtuosity trump Sontag 's loftiness , and it 's a constant temptation to use Kael as a cudgel to bonk the smirk of self-esteem off Sontag 's face with . I hope I can avoid it . It is n't useful , and it isn't-to use an unfashionable term that never fell out of fashion with either of them-honorable . What one achieved does n't diminish the other 's accomplishment . When in this book I place Sontag and Kael next to each other as perfect foils in their approaches , their purposes , and their personalities , the last thing I want to imply is that I 'm running a contest . One of the pleasures of being in my position is that I do n't have to choose . A few fundamental parallels sharpen their differences that much more . Both were Westerners who came east , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Kael began her career in the Bay Area and wrote for years as an establishment outsider ; Sontag was younger and far less formed when she left the West . Both concentrated in philosophy , a background that did n't hurt either one 's powers of argument ; Sontag 's career owes more ( or at least owes it more visibly ) to her formal education , in that she writes with a less seat-of-the-pants , more philosophical bent . Both were secular ( very secular ) Jews , heirs to an intellectual intensity that has gotten deflected , in the case of so many modern thinkers , from sacred works to cultural ones ; both exemplify what Sontag sometimes calls Jewish moral seriousness . ( Kael would have hated the phrase , but she would n't have disputed it . ) Both were single mothers , and there 's nothing like the need to support a child , as Kael once said , to jump-start one 's ambition . A final parallel they share only with each other . Though they barely knew each other , they were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States from the amazing era of cultural and political exuberance in the 1960s to the era of ossification that set in during the 1980s . After that , Kael stopped writing and Sontag shifted most of her attention to her fiction . I 'm using critic here to mean " commentator on art . " Sontag objects to the term and does n't consider herself a critic in the sense of " evaluator of art , " since she generally avoids taking on work she dislikes . This is one of their major differences . Kael was happy in the role of evaluator , and evaluation is how she gets to insight . She never lost her excitement about the this-weekness of this week 's movie , and while it may provide some enlightenment about last week 's movie or next week 's movie , this week 's movie-the work at hand-is what she 's there for . For Sontag , the work at hand ( which is nearly always a great or important one-the evaluating is finished before she sits down to write ) is a stepping stone : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger conclusions . Kael is a reviewer down to her toes ; her responses are specific . Sontag is an aesthetic theorist , if not always a systematic one . You can see the contrast easily in their approaches to the chestnut about what 's appropriate to theater and what 's appropriate to film . Kael is a pragmatist , and the question of domain does n't interest her much : " Filmed plays , " she writes , " are often denigrated , somewhat dishonestly , by people who learn a little cant about what is said to be proper to the film medium and forget about the pleasure they 've been getting from filmed plays all their lives . " She deals with the issue brusquely , impatient to move on , in her 1962 " Is There a Cure for Film Criticism ? " an evisceration of Siegfried Kracauer 's Theory of Film that is also one of her funniest attacks on theory in general . The whole debate about domains strikes her as misguided , since " what motion picture art shares with other arts is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , have exclusively . " Responding to Kracauer 's notions about what is " genuinely cinematic " ( big objects , for example ) , she snaps , " Who cares whether the objects on the screen are accessible or inaccessible to the stage , or , for that matter , to painting , or to the novel or poetry ? Who started this divide and conquer game of aesthetics in which the different media are assigned their special domains like salesmen staking out their territories-you stick to the Midwest and I 'll take Florida ? " " Who cares ? " may be a rhetorical question , but in this case it 's one with an answer : aesthetic theorists-specifically , Sontag , who devoted a substantial essay to the subject in 1966 . Sontag 's own views are n't any more prescriptive than Kael 's ( " there is no reason to insist on a single model for film ... it is no more part of the putative ' essence ' of movies that the camera must rove over a large physical area than it is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visual " ) , yet the question " What is the difference between theater and film ? " so needles her that she has to spend twenty-three pages worrying it out-doggedly , cogently , and , whatever Kael might think of the effort , fascinatingly . Kael is down-to-earth , and she likes it there . Sontag heads off on a quest in the other direction , with an impulse that borders on the religious , she 's searching for truth . Consider their use of a single word , serious ( and its derivatives seriousness , seriously ) . In 1988 Sontag told an interviewer , " Sometimes I feel that , in the end , all I am really defending-but then I say all is everything-is the idea of seriousness , of true seriousness . " She has no higher term of praise . It encapsulates everything that most affects her in art and in thought , and it recurs in her writing over and over : " No one who loves life would wish to imitate her dedication to martyrdom .... Yet so far as we love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it , nourished by it " ( " Simone Weil , " 1963 ) . " Still another use for silence : furnishing or aiding speech to attain its maximum integrity or seriousness " ( " The Aesthetics of Silence , " 1967 ) . " Artaud changed the understanding of what was serious , what was worth doing " ( " Approaching Artaud , " 1973 ) . " When I denounced ... certain kinds of facile moralism , it was in the name of a more alert , less complacent seriousness . What I did n't understand ... was that seriousness itself was in the early stages of losing credibility in the culture at large . ... Thirty years later , the undermining of standards of seriousness is almost complete " ( " Thirty Years Later ... , " 1996 ) . As Lionel Trilling observed of the Princess Casamassima , " Seriousness has become her ruling passion . " ( And , as he added , it 's also " her fatal sin , for seriousness is not exempt from the tendency of ruling passions to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serious , but you would n't know it from her vocabulary . Seldom does she use the word any way but ironically , as a term of derision-not serious but " serious . " " I could n't persuade friends to go see Charade .... The word had got around that it is n't important , that it is n't serious . " " Faces has the kind of seriousness that a serious artist could n't take seriously . " Of Jack Nicholson : " When he tried to give a quiet performance in The King of Marvin Gardens , he was so self-effacingly serious that he was a dead spot on the screen . " Of The Hindenburg : " Robert Wise brings all his flatulent seriousness to this endeavor . One gasbag meets another . " An emblematic usage occurs in one of her earliest essays , the 1956 " Movies , the Desperate Art " : " Representations of Americans in foreign films always feel wrong to an American audience . It is true we are shallow , but we are not carefree and irresponsible , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses as a commendation ( " the Great Work ... proposes satisfactions that are immense , solemn , and restricting " ) , on Kael 's tongue becomes a withering insult . Or take vulgar and its derivatives . Sontag uses the word as you 'd expect her to , pejoratively . " I do find much promise in the activities of young people .... And I include , not least of all , their interest in taking drugs-despite the unspeakable vulgarization of this project by Leary and others , " she wrote in " What 's Happening in America ( 1966 ) . " ( A special-case exception occurs in " Notes on ' Camp ' " : " The new-style dandy , the lover of Camp , appreciates vulgarity . " ) To the extent that vulgarity is the opposite of self-seriousness , Kael is willing to give it the benefit of the doubt . " How can you embrace life , " she demands of Woody Allen 's somber Another Woman , " and leave out all the good vulgar trashiness ? " " There 's no vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vulgarity is not as destructive to an artist as snobbery , and in the world of movies vulgar strength has been a great redemptive force , canceling out niggling questions of taste . " Kael might have been talking about Sontag when she wrote , " I do n't trust critics who say they care only for the highest and the best ; it 's an inhuman position , and I do n't believe them . " Her own appetite for what she called trash was , according to her , half of what made her ( and makes each one of us ) a critic . " I think the sense of feeling qualified to praise and complain in the same breath is part of our feeling that movies belong to us , " she wrote . " Going to the movies was more satisfying than what the schools had taught us was art . We responded totally-which often meant contemptuously , wanting more , wanting movies to be better . " Next to Kael 's catholicity , Sontag 's high-mindedness-her horror of the vulgar and the low-makes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumont . That 's a little unfair to Sontag ( and to Margaret Dumont ) , since the truth is that Kael is just as fixed on standards as Sontag is . Both are , preeminently , lovers of literature whose enthusiasm for cinema-a secondary enthusiasm , they both avow ( Kael more insistently , as a matter of fact ) - left them feeling seduced and abandoned as the art collapsed late in the century . True , Kael enjoyed trash , and enjoyed saying she enjoyed it , but she also fiercely upheld the distinction between trash and art . ( This was one of her beefs with the auteurists : " How can they , with straight faces , probe for deep meanings in these products ? Even the kids they 're made for know enough not to take them seriously . " ) Sontag generally avoids having to make the distinction at all by restricting her writing ( especially after Against Interpretation ) to art she esteems ; for her , what she esteems and what 's great are one and the same . From all the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat through a lot of it at the movies ) . The upshot is such a puritanical view of art- " I 'm an incorrigible puritan , " she freely admits-that for years it overshadowed her commitment to pleasure . Would she have found Kael vulgar ? It 's hard to imagine her surrendering herself to Kael 's style , which is everything hers isn't-exuberant , excessive , intimate , emotional , and , of course , funny . ( According to Leland Poague and Kathy A. Parsons 's Susan Sontag : An Annotated Bibliography , 1948-1992 , though , she did once express admiration for Kael 's criticism , in a 1980 interview with a Polish periodical . ) Sontag 's own critical style is such a model of detachment that at its most extreme it can suggest intelligence uninflected by personality . Something has been left out of these essays , you may feel ; something 's missing . And it 's true , something is : the phenomenal world , the world that bursts forth in all its " good vulgar trashiness " in Kael 's criticism-Sontag has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallows in the phenomenal world ; it 's a journalistic medium by nature . Not even the most world-embracing art-not even Shakespeare-can give you the vista of the world that you get through a movie ( though obviously it can give you something more ) . This journalistic side was fuel for Kael . Movies , she was fond of pointing out , show us how we live our lives and , by providing models of behavior ( social , professional , erotic ) , how to live our lives . " And if it be said that this is sociology , not aesthetics , " she wrote early on , " the answer is that an aesthetician who gave his time to criticism of current movies would have to be an awful fool . " Ideas alone were n't enough for her . Critical prose ca n't survive on ideas alone . It needs something more to give it traction ( or to give you traction ) , some poetry or some journalistic observation or at least some humor . Otherwise it dries out and turns into scholarship-which is fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reward the general reader . ( Insofar as it does , it 's something more than scholarship . ) Fortunately , Sontag provides it . Her meticulously worked sentences give off a soft glow . Continues ...
