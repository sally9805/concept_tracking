When the Bushes arrived for coffee Saturday morning , Bill Clinton was still nursing a paper cut on his finger . He had sliced it during a packing frenzy in the wee hours of Friday , and his friend Harry Thomason had tried to close the cut with Super Glue . Sorting his stuff through the night  --  an usher said the White House felt like a 7-Eleven all week  --  Clinton told a story about every gewgaw he was piling into boxes marked LIBRARY , CHAPPAQUA and WASHINGTON . <P> After a week of rolling parties for everyone from the Cabinet to the cleaning crew , parties so emotional that even Ironman John Podesta puddled up , it came down to saying goodbye to the household staff , which was rumored to have resented the Clintons since Day One . But everyone cried , even Hillary . She hugged one steward so long they segued into a waltz . Clinton gave them all his usual body slam . Another steward said , " I 'm really going to miss you , but I hear the next people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bushes moved into the Blue Room for coffee , the awkwardness that usually attends these rituals was missing . Bush and Clinton have little in common  --  not intellectual curiosity , not ideology , not attention span . But in December , when George W. Bush with his sports-jock patter made his first postelection visit to Clinton with his rock-star genes , they just clicked . The new guy had no questions about Third World debt . He wanted to know what made the place tick and how you mainline yourself into the nation 's bloodstream . Clinton told Bush he was lucky to know already where the light switches were and to have hired people who had been there before . Bush asked Clinton what he thought about Bush 's calling him " the Shadow " during the campaign . Had it spooked Gore ? Must have , Clinton said ; he did n't ask me to appear with him , did he ? Pretty smart , hey ? Bush laughed , scrunching his shoulders . <P> The Shadow developed nearly as much affinity for Bush in two hours as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later told friends , " Bush really connects . It 's a mistake to underestimate him . " And after seeing Clinton in May , at St. Patrick 's Cathedral for John Cardinal O'Connor 's funeral  --  Clinton reaching across four mourners to grasp Bush 's hand during the Sign of Peace  --  Bush said , " I do n't always respect the guy , but you got ta like him . " Maybe they see the scamp in each other . At the Inaugural Day coffee , it was as if old friends were back in town . When Chelsea seemed teary amid the hubbub , Bush put an arm around her shoulders .
