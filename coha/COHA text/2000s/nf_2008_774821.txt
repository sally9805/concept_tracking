Welcome to Guyland // The ignominy of boyhood ; the distress Of boyhood changing into man ; The unfinished man and his pain . - william butler yeats // " A Dialogue of Self and Soul " ( 1933 ) // Jeff is 24 , tall and fit , with shaggy brown hair and an easy smile . After graduating from Brown three years ago , with an honors degree in history and anthropology , he moved back home to the Boston suburbs and started looking for a job . After several months , he found one , as a sales representative for a small Internet provider . He stays in touch with friends from college by text message and email , and still heads downtown on weekends to hang out at Boston 's " Brown bars . " " It 's kinda like I never left college , " he says , with a mixture of resignation and pleasure . " Same friends , same aimlessness. " // Andy is 17 , a high-school senior in the San Diego area . Affable , slightly chubby , and wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the moment , he 's waiting to hear to which University of California campus he 'll be accepted . Or if he 'll be accepted . Once a reasonably good student , he says he now worries that he 's spent so much time playing video games and hanging out in online communities that he has n't studied hard enough and that his grades have suffered . " I just get kinda lost in there , your know ? " he says . " My parents think I 'm doing homework all the time , so I sorta keep it a secret . " While he was hoping for UCLA or Santa Barbara , he is also sending in a few applications to other , less competitive state colleges , just in case . " My parents are going to freak if I do n't get into UCLA , " he says , wincing. // Brian is 21 , a senior chemistry major at Indiana . Serious and earnest , he is putting himself through school by working two jobs off campus-waiting tables in a local restaurant on weekends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he is not in class or lab . An honors student , he wakes up at about six every morning so he can study in quiet in his dorm room . // His freshman roommate , Dave , still a friend , has approached college life somewhat differently . A business major , Dave usually wakes up around noon , hangs out at his fraternity house playing video games with his fraternity brothers until dinner , and then heads out to the local bars for the night . He estimates that he drinks five nights a week , parties all weekend , and studies only the night before finals , if then . He had been putting himself through school gambling online , but he ran into a streak of bad luck and now owes about $12,000. // We sit together in one of the many snack bars around campus . " I do n't understand Dave , never did , " Brian says . " But he 's my friend anyway , and he invites me to the cool parties , which , I confess , I never go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he does n't understand me ? I think it 's great to want to have a career and all , but Brian is , like , so tight , you know . He 's such a go-getter . He does n't get that college is about parties and fun-oh , and did I mention the drinking ? " He laughs . // Jason graduated from Dartmouth almost five years ago . Now 26 , he works in finance in Boston and shares a Back Bay apartment with five other guys with whom he went to school . He runs and works out , stays fit , and dates lots of different women-all in their early twenties . At night , he hangs out at the " Dartmouth bars " of Boston . " Hey , college was supposed to be the best years of your life , right ? " he explains , with only a trace of defensiveness in his voice . " So where is it written that it has to end when you graduate ? College is forever , man . That 's what the admissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forever is now . " // These are some of the young men you will meet in this book . They 're among the nearly 400 I 've interviewed over the past four years-on college campuses , in neighborhood bars and coffee shops , in Internet chat rooms , and at sports events . Most of them are college educated , from good homes in reasonably affluent suburbs and urban areas . Most are white , but I talked with plenty of Latino , African-American , and Asian-American guys . Most are middle class , but I also made sure to talk with high-school grads who never went to college but instead worked in auto body shops , served in the military , and opened small businesses . Most were straight , but I spoke with quite a few gay and bisexual guys as well . // In another era , these guys would undoubtedly be poised to take their place in the adult world , taking the first steps toward becoming the nation 's future professionals , entrepreneurs , and business leaders . They would be engaged to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for futures as civic leaders and Little League dads . Not today . // Today , many of these young men , poised between adolescence and adulthood , are more likely to feel anxious and uncertain . In college , they party hard but are soft on studying . They slip through the academic cracks , another face in a large lecture hall , getting by with little effort and less commitment . After graduation , they drift aimlessly from one dead-end job to another , spend more time online playing video games and gambling than they do on dates ( and probably spend more money too ) , " hook up " occasionally with a " friend with benefits , " go out with their buddies , drink too much , and save too little . After college , they perpetuate that experience and move home or live in group apartments in major cities , with several other guys from their dorm or fraternity . They watch a lot of sports . They have grandiose visions for their futures and not a clue how to get from here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty , they 're likely to paper over it with a simple " it 's all good .
