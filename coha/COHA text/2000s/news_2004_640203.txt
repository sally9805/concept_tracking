<p> HOUSTON - About four years ago , on the eve of Super Bowl XXXIV , San Francisco sports writer Ira Miller gave his formal presentation advocating the candidacy of a former 49ers player for the Pro Football Hall of Fame . <p> Rising from his chair , Miller looked around the room , uttered the words ' Joe Montana ' and sat back down . By the time Miller had returned to his seat , the campaign was over , the quarterback assured of being elected to the Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio , in his first year of eligibility . <p> If only every choice were so easy . History may repeat itself Saturday , when representatives from Detroit and Denver address the 39-member selection committee and invoke the names of Barry Sanders and a former No. 7-wearing quarterback from Colorado . <p> But such slam dunks are very much the exception to the rule when it comes to granting each year 's Hall pass . The rules stipulate that three to six new members be selected each year . The process has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the milder terms used . <p> Each year there seems to be more than a little bit of controversy , so while Sanders and John Elway seem to be locks for the class of 2004 , by the time the meeting concludes after some three , four or five hours of deliberation , there are likely to be some hurt feelings . <p> ' The way I look at it is like this , ' Sports Illustrated writer Peter King said . ' Everyone 's name who comes up is definitely worthy of a deep discussion and consideration . But the bottom line is that it 's the Pro Football Hall of Fame - not the Pro Football Hall of the Very Good . ' <p> The 39-man board - right now , it is all men - meets on the eve of every Super Bowl . The committee has one media representative from each of the 31 NFL cities , with New York having two participants because of the Jets and Giants . In addition , there are six at-large voters with the 39th given to the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Denver is Denver Post columnist Woody Paige . Post NFL writer Adam Schefter is the voting member from the PFWA . <p> This weekend , at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston , the group will be considering a list of 15 finalists , those players having been pared from an original list of 60 to 70 possibilities . <p> Last year in San Diego , as the committee pondered the candidates , one of them , running back Marcus Allen , awaited the news in an adjoining hallway . <p> ' It 's a tough time . You 're sitting there , and what you 've strived for your whole athletic career is right in front of you , ' he said . ' A guy would come out and say , ' Marcus , you made the final 10 , ' then he 'd walk away . Ten minutes later , someone would come out and say , ' Hey , it 's looking good . ' <p> ' But you 're there , and what if all of a sudden they do n't call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Any person , including a fan , can nominate any player , coach or administrator for consideration for the Hall of Fame as long as , in the case of players , he has been retired at least five seasons . To ensure that older players are considered , there is a Seniors Committee , which names two players from before 1979 to be included in the list of 15 finalists . <p> A player must receive 80 percent of the vote to be named . Finalists are eliminated during a series of votes . <p> Each voter has statistical information on each of the finalists . When a player comes up , one of the board members usually gives a presentation stating the player 's case for the Hall . Sometimes , as in the case of Montana , not much more than saying the name is needed . <p> Most of the time , however , there is a series of discussions , with a great deal of back-and- <p> forth between advocates and opponents of any particular player . The nature of those arguments can be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player deserves to be in the Hall of Fame when a similar player at the same position is not . <p> Sometimes , in the tradition of New York 's Tammany Hall , Richard Daley 's Chicago or anywhere else there are backroom goings- <p> on , politics playing a role , with board members pledging support for each other 's candidates , whether immediately or at some point in the future . <p> ' I think there are some blocs , ' said Mike Preston of The Baltimore Sun . ' Guys who think alike or come from the same place , like the ones who covered the old AFC Central Division . ' <p> While wondering if he would be elected last year , Allen considered the idea that journalists , who from time to time have been known to have prickly relationships with athletes , hold the key to his entry into the Hall of Fame . <p> ' That 's always been challenging for a lot of players to comprehend and understand , ' Allen said . ' There are always political reasons - one person may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's always a little bit of apprehension and fear because of that . ' <p> Len Shapiro of The Washington Post said he has heard of cases where writers let it be known they should be talked to because they held a Hall of Fame vote . <p> ' I 've never done it , ' he said . ' But there are times when you 'd definitely think about it - when someone treats you like a jerk and you 're thinking , ' Do you think you 'd ever get my vote ? " <p> Feelings do matter <p> Even without testy interpersonal relationships , the process can be powerful . <p> ' There are some guys who you just know when their name comes up that there are going to be sparks flying , ' Preston said . <p> In 2002 , one of those names was Art Modell , the longtime owner of the Cleveland Browns who moved the franchise to Baltimore in 1996 . The journalist-presenter for Modell was Cleveland Plain Dealer writer Tony Grossi . <p> While board members say Grossi was professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly endorse Modell 's candidacy because of the impact the move from Cleveland had on the city . <p> Modell was n't elected and has n't been a finalist since . <p> ' Everyone knows Art Modell has done a lot of great things for the league , but I wonder if he knew that the move to Baltimore would probably come with a price , ' said ESPN 's John Clayton , a 12-year member of the committee . ' I do n't have that passion about the Cleveland-Baltimore controversy , but I do n't know how high I 'd have him on my list . I 'm not sure he would have made it anyway . That 's the subjective nature of what we do . ' <p> Sometimes voters are persuaded by the credentials of other committee members . Paul Zimmerman of Sports Illustrated , a former pro football player , is regarded as the expert on line play . Last year , during the discussion on offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman ( no relation ) , the former Broncos star was compared favorably with Anthony Muoz , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position in NFL history . <p> ' When that happened , ' Preston said , ' ( Paul ) Zimmerman just yelled out , ' Oh come on ! ' - I said to myself , ' Uh , oh , Gary 's in trouble . " <p> Gary Zimmerman was not elected . He is one of the 15 finalists again this year . <p> That 's not the case with another finalist from last year , former Broncos linebacker Randy Gradi- <p> shar . <p> ' I probably could have done a better job trying to get Gary in , ' Paige said . ' I really put my heart into trying to get Randy in last year because I thought it would be his last chance . I thought Gary was going to be a slam dunk or have other chances . ' <p> Monk under scrutiny <p> This year , one of the most animated discussions likely will center on former Washington Redskins wide receiver Art Monk . <p> Fifth on the league 's all-time <p> receptions list with 940 , Monk has been caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lofton along with John Stallworth and Lynn Swann of the Pittsburgh Steelers . <p> While none of that trio has more catches , they have been regarded by most voters as more dynamic players than Monk , largely a possession receiver during his NFL career . Each has been elected to the Hall of Fame , Lofton last year . <p> King says wide receiver is the most difficult position to judge when it comes to selecting for the Hall . Swann won four championships with the Steelers , and was a brilliant postseason performer whose four catches for 161 yards won him the MVP of Super Bowl X. But he did n't get King 's vote . <p> ' I look at Swann like I do ( former New York Yankees outfielder ) Roger Maris , ' he said . ' In the regular season , he only averaged something like 2.6 catches a game . Roger Maris did something great for one season ( hitting 61 home runs in 1961 ) . Swann did some great things in the playoffs , but does that make him a Hall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he covered the New York Giants and talked with the team 's coaches about the Redskins , he was told they were first concerned with Washington 's running game and then wide receiver Gary Clark , who played alongside Monk . <p> ' Now , if your biggest rival is telling me that they think there are two offensive entities more threatening than you , how can I vote for you to be in the Hall ? ' King asks . <p> Shapiro has been on the committee for 20 years and has presented Monk as a finalist on four <p> occasions . <p> ' It 's been frustrating because to me , there 's no question he belongs , ' Shapiro said . ' It 's a maddening process . Sometimes I 've simplified the presentation , sometimes I 've used endorsements from others . Maybe I 'll be more forceful this year , but really I think I should just say to everyone , ' Come on , it 's time . " <p> No clear measure <p> Even with the politics and heated discussions , participants say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halls . <p> ' In our process we have discussions , there 's an educational process , you have a chance to weigh things better . It 's not just some cold , proxy vote like baseball , ' Clayton said . ' And I think that aspect of it is very important , because football is n't a statistics- <p> oriented game like baseball . Just looking at numbers does n't help you in football . ' <p> Certain numbers , like Montana 's four Super Bowl championships , or 40,551 passing yards , or Elway 's 47 fourth-quarter and overtime comebacks , leap from the page . But how does one measure the candidacy of , say , a defensive end , particularly when statistics on sacks , now the standard for the position , were n't kept before 1982 ? How does someone gauge which interior offensive linemen , perhaps the most anonymous position in the game , excelled throughout their career ? <p> ' I 'd like to convene a panel of some of those guys , just to see how they go about deciding , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Warren Moon , said he too is curious about what takes place during the committee meetings . Eligible for selection in 2005 , Moon , who threw for 49,325 yards in a 17-year NFL career , may get a chance to experience the process next January in Jacksonville , Fla . <p> " People ask me if I deserve to be there and I tell them it 's not up to me . It 's out of my hands and I have no control over it , " Moon said . " The only control I had was playing as hard as I could on Sunday afternoons . "
