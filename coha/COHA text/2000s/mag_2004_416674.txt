Ramon Flick has no desire to risk diarrhea , vomiting , multi-organ failure or death . So when he studies lethal Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus , he does so wearing a spacesuit inside a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory , a " hot zone " that uses negative air pressure , special door seals , disinfectant showers and autoclaves to contain the most deadly viruses in the world . Flick , who runs a new 1,600-square-foot BSL4 lab at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston , is one of an elite crew . Fewer than 50 people in the United States have BSL4 lab experience , because until recently there were only three facilities , one at Ft . Detrick in Maryland , another in San Antonio , Texas , and a third at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . That 's about to change : Since 9/11 and the anthrax scare of 2001 , hot labs have been hot items in government science budgets . Last year , the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease received the largest funding increase in NIH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labs . NIAID and the University of Texas are building a gigantic 13,000-square-foot , $167 million BSL4 lab , right next to Flick 's " baby " lab . Similar state-of-the-art facilities are sprouting up in Massachusetts and Montana . In all , the national square footage of BSL4 lab space will jump an order of magnitude when these labs open in 2008 , and the number of people needed to work in them will septuple , from 50 to 350 . Most scientists agree that three Level 4 labs were n't enough , but many say the correction is too massive , and that the proliferation of labs is more likely to endanger than protect . Even Flick admits , " Yeah , it 's overkill . " Perhaps the most chilling objection to the uptick in biolabs is that they will increase the chances of a deadly outbreak , either by the release of a pathogen out of a lab , or by the admittance of a terrorist into one . Some of the BSL4 biodefense work will attempt to make viruses more deadly in order to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , argues Richard Ebright , a Rutgers molecular biologist who sits on several biodefense think tanks , we 're inviting spies to use our work against us . This possibility has fueled a firestorm over background checks for hot-zoners . It has also led to deep soul-searching among the scientific community about whether BSL4 research should be open science or secretive security work . A recent National Academy of Sciences report on biotechnology and terrorism argued that hot-lab science be kept in the open realm of NIH peer review . But it also recommended a new form of scientific censorship : Grant proposals should be pre-screened , and any deemed to be a security threat by generating information useful to terrorists should be nipped in the funding bud . Others say biodefense research should be classified . " It should be taken out of NIH and put into the Department of Defense , lock , stock and barrel , " says Ebright . If secrecy hampers progress , though , public health may suffer most .  --  WILLIAM SPEED WEED HOMELAND SECURITY OR PRIVACY INVASION ?

This new consent form ( above ) has sparked a heated debate among scientists . Two leading hot-zoners weigh in . " The background check is essential , and it needs to be expanded . Otherwise , we 're going to fill these labs with Al Qaeda plants . The current assessments are de minimus screening . "  --  Richard Ebright , molecular biologist , member of the Institutional Biosafety Committee " There 's no way I 'm going to sign the consent form , because they can release my information to anyone . It 's one thing to prove we do n't have a criminal record , it 's another to be treated as a suspect .
