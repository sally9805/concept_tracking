THE TAKEOVER // A decade before 9/11 , the worldwide surge in Islamic fundamentalism and its virulent hatred of the West was largely unrecognized in America . We did not notice when some of the most prominent radicals moved to this country and set up operations just across the river from the World Trade Center . Those early militants , ignored in their new chosen homeland , would become the role models and inspiration for some of the World Trade Center and Pentagon hijackers in 2001. // Brooklyn 's Atlantic Avenue is only thirty minutes away by the Number 4 train from the World Trade Center . Before September 11 , a nearby waterfront promenade offered postcard views of the twin towers . But these two New York neighborhoods might as well be different countries . The sterile and overbuilt financial center on the tip of Manhattan that was rendered into a giant open-air cemetery covered by tons of twisted debris is quintessentially American . The mile stretch of Brooklyn seems a much closer cousin to downtown Cairo than Wall Street . It is a neighborhood overcrowded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone just arrived from Lebanon or Syria , they might feel at home along those gritty and packed streets . Many Muslims , in traditional robe and turban , crowd near the Islamic community centers and bookshops , Middle Eastern restaurants , grocery stores and bakeries , smoke shops , translation services , and hairdressers . Some men gather in small groups at outdoor caf ? s , sipping minted tea and smoking from bubbling hookahs , large , standing water pipes filled with fruit- and herb-infused tobacco . Women in layered skirts and head-covering scarves , babies in tow , walk several paces behind the men . Quavering Arab music blares from several record stores . On Fridays , the Muslim day of prayer , when the mosques fill , overflow crowds by the hundreds throw down small prayer rugs on the sidewalk and prostrate themselves toward Mecca . // The mosques range from lavish Ottoman-style buildings to basements of car service garages . But the best known house of worship is Masjid al-Farooq , located on several floors of a run-down commercial building . The second-floor sanctuary is bathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worn **26;819;TOOLONG carpet . Worshipers line up shoulder to shoulder , creating human stripes across the carpet , all facing Mecca and praying . Incense sticks resting in cracks in the plaster walls fill the room with a sweet smell . Racks along the back wall hold a collection of workingmen 's shoes : Nike sneakers , paint-spattered construction boots , worn-out wing tips , scuffed thick-soled shoes of civil servants . Among the crowd of ? migr ? s are African-Americans , young men with knitted skullcaps or baseball caps turned backward . // The imam , the mosque 's prayer leader , stands in a simple brown robe behind a plain wooden lectern , reading verses from the Koran . Many of the faithful-men in their twenties from Yemen , Egypt , Jordan , and the West Bank-gather in the hallway after the service . They trade information about jobs at cab companies and at construction sites , and pass along tips on cheap rooms for rent and religious activities for Arabic-speaking newcomers . Some discuss the attack on the World Trade Center three days ago , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic . // This Arab mecca in the heart of New York is not a recent phenomenon . The migration had started in the early 1900s as Arabs fled persecution in the Ottoman Empire . Some set up shop not far from their stop at Ellis Island-on Manhattan 's Washington Street and Brooklyn 's Atlantic Avenue . In the 1930s , and again after World War II , there were waves of new immigrants . Manhattan 's high prices drove most newcomers to Brooklyn . " This area is known as an Arab enclave throughout the world , " boasts Sam Moustapha , a co-owner of the family-run Oriental Pastry and Grocery Company . // It is a neighborhood where Arabs are not timid about embracing political sentiments that often seem continents removed from nearby Manhattan . Many of the local businesses have long displayed prominent anti-Israeli , pro-intifada signs and banners . Even in the immediate wake of 9/11 , a flyer posted outside al-Qaraween 's Islamic bookstore , next to a mosque , declared , " Allah is great-may justice come to the infidels . " At the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon were stamped over with the crosshairs of a sniper 's rifle scope . // A small convenience store had a half dozen posters plastered on the wall behind the counter . They were grainy black-and-white blowups of young men , all holding weapons , wearing kaffiyehs wrapped around their heads and covering their faces like Bedouins in a sandstorm . All that was visible were the intense stares of angry young Arab militants that Americans have now come to know too well . Arabic writing was scrawled on the posters . They were tributes to suicide bombers . Each of the men on the wall had blown himself apart in a terror attack against Israel . When asked about the posters and why they were on display , only miles from where thousands of Americans and foreigners lay dead from a suicide mission , the clerk pretended he did not speak English . More questions were answered only with grunts and dismissive waves . // Further down the block , at the sixty-five-year-old Damascus Bread and Pastry , Arab men have been eating and arguing politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticky dates , nut-filled pastries , and an amazing assortment of pita bread , some of which is put to good use right outside by a falafel vendor . Inside the tiny room , dense with thick and heady smoke from hours of chain-smoking , Egyptians , Syrians , Jordanians , and Lebanese sit , packed elbow to elbow , discussing the terror attacks . Many have lived through years of crises , including four Arab-Israeli wars , the arrests of local Hamas bomb makers , the nearby murder ten years earlier of radical Jewish activist Rabbi Meir Kahane , the Gulf War , and the now legendary neighborhood tales of the first World Trade Center bombers who lived and worshiped along these very streets . // Five young men at the counter , cradling cell phones and packs of cigarettes , were not as reticent as the others to talk to a stranger . Yes , the World Trade Center attack was terrible . But America must have known how hated it was , and that such a strike was surely coming . One slammed the Formica counter so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mudlike coffee flipped over . How could America support the terror state of Israel , he asked , and then cry foul when the underpowered struck back ? // On this unusually warm autumn day , only days after the September 11 attacks that pushed America into a world it did not seek nor for which it was prepared , walking along Atlantic Avenue , one can still see the buildings that once served as rallying grounds for the neighborhood 's militants . These were the places that fueled the activism that eventually led to attacks like 9/11. // At one end of a block , where the elevated subway train casts deep angular shadows over the intersection of Foster and McDonald avenues , an Arabic chant blares over a loudspeaker every Friday , sounding the call to prayer at the Abu Bakr Siddique mosque . Except for a fortresslike entry , the building does n't look much different from other wood-frame houses nearby . But it was here that Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman , the blind extremist Egyptian cleric now serving a life sentence for seditious conspiracy for the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City landmarks , tunnels , and bridges , preached his violent rhetoric . Rahman had immigrated to the United States in 1990 and inexplicably cleared Customs although he was on a domestic terrorist watch list . // Virtual solitary confinement in a federal prison hospital in Rochester , Minnesota , evidently did little to temper his hatred . In 1998 , from his cell , he smuggled out a fatwa , a religious order , urging his followers to " cut all links with the United States . Destroy them thoroughly and erase them from the face of the earth . Ruin their economies , set their companies on fire , turn their conspiracies to powder and dust . Sink their ships , bring their planes down . Slay them in air , on land , on water . And with the command of Allah , kill them wherever you find them . Catch them and put them in prison . Lie in wait for them and kill these infidels . They will surely get great oppression from you . God will make you the means of wreaking a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support you against them . " That fatwa has become part of the curriculum in more than thirty thousand Islamic religious schools in Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , and Yemen . // At the other end of the block , just a few hundred yards from the mosque , is a simple red-brick house at the corner of Ocean Parkway and Foster . One can not tell from the outside that until 1997 it was the headquarters of Kahane Chai , the militant Jewish group . That was the same year the State Department branded it a terrorist organization . Kahane Chai was devoted to the teachings of Rabbi Meir Kahane , gunned down in Manhattan by an Arab immigrant in 1990 . The rabbi preached a strident racism that attracted adherents in local Jewish neighborhoods . Among them was a young doctor , Baruch Goldstein , the former Brooklyn resident who in 1994 slaughtered twenty-nine Muslims while they prayed in a West Bank mosque . // But on this day , with the sun setting in less than an hour , the interest is in the remnants of the Alkifah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The center used to be nestled behind one of the ordinary-looking storefronts along Atlantic Avenue . Its stated purpose was to raise money so local Muslims could join the fight against Soviet forces in Afghanistan . Federal officials say the now shuttered center was a gathering place for Islamic terrorists , the first American base for Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network . The center was where key personal relationships were forged between men of different nationalities who shared bin Laden 's extreme interpretation of Islam . // In the mid-1980s , the Alkifah Center was a neighborhood hub on Atlantic Avenue . It started out as a single desk in the al-Farooq mosque around 1986 and then moved into a grungy second-floor apartment in a building a few doors away at 566 Atlantic Avenue , above what is now a perfume factory . That tiny space had barely enough room for a desk , a few chairs , a phone , and a fax machine . Although many in the neighborhood recall that the Alkifah Center ran on a shoestring , documents submitted in U.S. court cases revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts during its heyday of the late 1980s and early 1990s. // The center 's director was Emir Mustafa Shalabi , a young Egyptian immigrant with a shock of red hair . Shalabi was infused with the same religious fervor for the Afghan cause that roused many young Muslims who regarded it as a holy war to liberate an Islamic country from communist domination . Neighbors began calling Alkifah the " jihad office . " Shalabi invited Sergeant Ali Mohamed , a former Egyptian army officer and U.S. Army Green Beret , to the center 's basement offices under the al-Farooq mosque . Armed with official U.S. Army videotapes and military documents marked " Top Secret , " Mohamed conducted a series of weekend " training " classes and a two-week-long intensive seminar . Almost all the volunteers were Arab immigrants . They bought $600 one-way fares as a sign they were willing to give their lives for Islam . // At those training classes were such future terrorists as El-Sayyid A. Nosair , the Egyptian immigrant later charged with killing Rabbi Kahane ; Mohammed Salameh and Clement Rodney Hampton-El , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Mahmud Abouhalima , Sheikh Rahman 's part-time driver , found guilty of conspiracy in the 1998 East African embassy bombings that killed fifty-nine and wounded more than five thousand . Sergeant Mohamed himself would eventually plead guilty to conspiring to bomb the East African embassies . // Even when the Soviets humiliatingly withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 , the turmoil of the civil war to which Afghanistan fell victim echoed in Brooklyn , and Shalabi kept Alkifah open . The religious fury of many young Arab men who had fought the Soviets now turned against secular Arab governments and , ultimately , America , with its military presence in the Persian Gulf and its support for Israel . Also , the mujahedeen , or holy warriors , in Afghanistan were now fighting to create a strict Islamic state admired by many of the younger men in Brooklyn . // The turning point for the Alkifah Refugee Center came in 1990 when Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman arrived in Brooklyn . An almost legendary cleric whose extreme rhetoric had incited the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat , Rahman had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealthy Saudi mujahedeen leader , Osama bin Laden . As word of Rahman 's interest in the center spread in the Muslim community , hard-core fundamentalists flocked to it . // Emir Shalabi , who was the American representative of the Afghan Services Bureau , a recruiting organization cofounded by bin Laden , had sponsored Rahman 's entry into the country . Shalabi took the blind sheikh into his house , gave him a part-time driver , helped him move to an apartment in Bay Ridge , and even paid for his food and telephone bill . He also made the sheikh an integral part of his Afghanistan campaign . And when the al-Farooq needed a new imam , the fifty-two-year-old Sheikh Rahman , with the support of Shalabi , was selected , and started delivering the fiery sermons that condemned anti-Islamic practices and tyrannical foreign governments . Before long he denounced other mosque members , including some Yemenis who sold pork , beer , and pornographic magazines in local grocery stores . // Not long after the sheikh 's arrival , there was a power struggle at the Alkifah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office 's donations to his militant supporters in Egypt . Shalabi refused . He remained loyal to the man who had originally inspired him , Abdullah Azzam . A Palestinian professor of Islamic studies in Jordan , Azzam was a mentor to Osama bin Laden . Azzam had visited America often in the 1980s , urging support for the war in Afghanistan . // Others in the tightly knit Arab community in New York and Jersey City , where the sheikh moved after feuding with Shalabi , say there were rumors that Shalabi had stolen money from the jihad office and might be involved in counterfeiting . Despite the whisper campaign , which Rahman fostered , Shalabi refused to relinquish control of the fund-raising . Rahman 's supporters began complaining that Shalabi had become " an internal problem . " A vicious quarrel over political direction and leadership-the organization 's very soul-was under way . //
