FOR 30 YEARS , SOME WIDE-EYED DREAMERS HAVE BEEN CHISELING A 745-MILE ROUTE THROUGH THE CANADIAN ROCKIES . THE RESULT IS A LABOR OF LOVE SET TO BECOME ONE OF NORTH AMERICA 'S MOST MAGNIFICENT LONG TRAILS . // To the north of the Lower 48 , there 's a trail that tickles the spine of the Rockies and is possibly the most spectacular long  --  distance hiking route in North America . This trail weaves back and forth some 745 breathtaking miles between the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia , traversing country far grander and wilder than any contiguous mountain wilderness in the United States . If tacked onto the northern terminus of the Continental Divide Trail ( CDT )  --  as some believe it should be  --  the combined routes would create , without a doubt , the most eye  --  popping , jaw-dropping , challenging wilderness trail on Earth . And chances are , you 've never heard of this amazing footpath . It 's called the Great Divide Trail ( GDT ) , and because it winds through big , rough country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails , particularly those outside the national parks , the GDT is less pronounced and signed than those in the Lower 48 . The hiking season is short and the weather volatile . Snow can fall at any time of the year , conceals much of the route through June , and remains on high passes well into July and August . Prolonged , heavy rain is common . Many streams must be forded , often near their glacial source , which makes for frigid water and daily fluctuations in flow that may halt your progress . Biting insects buzz through the air in squadron strength through much of the hiking season . Black bears , grizzlies , and even wolverines are all along the route , so food must be safely hung at all camps . Resupply points and potential rescue sources are remote . Sound daunting ? It is , but if you can handle the fact that the trail is a work in progress and that periodically you 'll be challenged when it vanishes into the wilds , the reward is well worth the effort . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most magnificent settings in North America . That the GDT exists at all is a testament to the dedication of some hikers who 've refused to let a 30-year-old vision die . The idea of a Canadian Rockies trail originated in the mid-1960s when the Girl Guides ( Canada 's equivalent of the Girl Scouts ) first floated the idea . Inspired , a Parks Canada consultant , Jim Thorsell , led a summer 1967 trail-use survey , which found that a Great Divide Trail was doable and that " the time is now right .... " The idea languished due to Parks Canada officials ' concerns about increasing visitation . Thorsell , meanwhile , continued to champion the idea and in 1970 , he published the Provisional Trail Guide and Map for the Proposed Great Divide Trail . The following year , the Canadian Rockies Trail Guide was published , which also contained a description of the route . The publicity led federal officials to express support for the GDT , but 9 years after the concept surfaced , there was nothing to show for it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-distance trail . Their advocacy led the Alberta provincial government to recommend a system of trails stretching southward along the Continental Divide . The idea caught the attention of a college student named Cliff White , who knew of Thorsell 's research . During his first year at the University of Calgary , he met several others who also were intrigued by the long-trail concept , so they " put in for a government youth grant to study the GDT 's possible routing . We qualified , and in 1974 , six of us took off to do a trail survey , " he says . It was " the original shoestring trip , " says White , who 's now a conservation biologist at Alberta 's Banff National Park . " We got to hike all over and get paid for it  --  kind of . There were three groups of two . We had three old cars we wrestled down muddy back roads , then we 'd spend days hiking around , surveying the terrain . " The downside was the food budget , which was only $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous stuff , like textured vegetable protein , " team member Jenny Feick remembers . " And we put a lot of miles on those boots , surveying more than 2,000 square miles on both sides of the Rocky Mountain Divide , from Banff to the Montana border . " The students plotted and surveyed every feature , natural and cultural , along the proposed route . Immediately following what Feick calls " that magnificent summer " of 1974 , she and fellow " Gang of Six " members Dave Higgins and Mary Jane Cox formed the nonprofit Great Divide Trail Association ( GDTA ) . For the next 11 years , the GDTA organized volunteer trail crews that established and marked nearly 100 miles of track spanning the 245-mile stretch between Banff and Waterton Lakes National Park on the Montana border . " It was easy to get government approval on the Alberta side , but impossible in British Columbia , " says James Prescott , an active GDTA volunteer since the late ' 70s . " Basically , they 'd say , ' Just because you run a trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now it wo n't be clearcut . ' " In 1986 , the trail stalled close to the British Columbia border . Meanwhile , Parks Canada officials gradually warmed to the idea of the GDT , in part due to a new permit system that controlled backcountry users ' numbers . As a result , the current hiking route utilizes preexisting paths and rugged cross-country routes in the national and provincial parks of Mt . Robson , Jasper , Yoho , Banff , Mt . Assiniboine , and Peter Lougheed , before heading southward through Height of the Rockies and Elk Lakes Provincial Parks . Farther south , in the Forest Reserves of the Highwood , Crow 's Nest Pass , and Castle regions , the route remains a patchwork of power line cuts , two-track roads , and cross-country bushwhacks . " The Great Divide Trail is n't dead , " says Prescott , " but it 's been on life support for a long time . " So what are the chances that this route will someday become a well-established path like its Lower 48 cousin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be combining with a citizen groundswell to offer renewed hope . Organizers point to a more enlightened environmental attitude in British Columbia 's provincial government , which could allow for a protected trail corridor southward . The GDTA , as well , is waking from a long dormancy . A new guidebook , Hiking Canada 's Great Divide Trail may further hasten the resurrection . " After doing the trail , Julia and I decided it would be a waste to simply ' can ' all that information , " says author Dustin Lynx , who thru-hiked the GDT with his wife in 1996 . " So I put it together into a guidebook . " One interesting twist to Lynx 's well-organized , thorough guide is that it highlights a scouted route that extends some 170 miles north beyond the GDT 's traditional end in Mt . Robson Provincial Park . The extra miles would carry hikers through the Willmore Wilderness to Kakwa Provincial Park , beyond which there 's another 125-mile stretch that leads to Monkman Provincial Park . " From what I 've seen , the area around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorges as major obstacles , but I think it 'll make fabulous hiking , " says Lynx . Those committed to the GDT say that the key to completing the project will be a strong constituency of hikers who are willing to step forward and tell land management officials to finish this trail . " We 've always had a dedicated core of people who 'll do the trail work , " says Higgins . " What we need now are organizers , people willing to work with government and motivate local grassroots support for the southern sections of the trail . " Here 's how you can help : * Contact the Great Divide Trail Association ( www.greatdividetrail.ca ; as we went to press , this Web site was in the process of being developed ) . The group organizes trail crews beginning in mid  --  June . No phone calls , please . * If you 're a student who is considering a career in land management , recreation , environmentalism , or even politics , inquire about a GDTA internship. * If you 're an energetic retiree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the story of the GDT , it 's that trails , particularly grand ones , are n't created with the stroke of a pen , nor even the swing of a thousand Pulaskis . They 're living entities that need nurturing . They 're the realization of many accumulated voices and visions . And certainly , the Great Divide Trail is one grand vision that should n't be allowed to die . <p>
