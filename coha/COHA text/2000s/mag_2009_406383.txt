UNMOTIVATED AT SCHOOL My 11 - year- old son gets good marks at school and seems to thrive on his many activities . The problem is that he refuses to buckle down and get work done in class . He says he would prefer to do the work at home , but that just is n't possible with his busy extracurricular schedule . I have explained to him that hockey , Scouting and the other things he likes to do come second to school , but none of it seems to be sinking in. * Why does he have problems settling down to do his work at school ? That 's the real question here . I wonder if it 's because he needs some downtime : Maybe he 's saving his school work to do at home so that he can take a break from his busy extracurricular schedule . A project that 's due tomorrow is a great excuse not to attend tonight 's hockey practice . Or it could be that he sees school as an ideal time to relax , away from his active home life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his extracurricular activities and see if his attitude changes . - Kathy Lynn , parent educator TOE-WALKING My three-year-old daughter still walks on her toes - not just occasionally , but all the time . Our paediatrican has said there 's nothing to worry about as long as we start to see an improvement , but so far nothing has changed and I 'm starting to worry . * Infants and toddlers just learning to walk may intermittently go up on their toes . By age three , however , almost continuous toe-walking is not the norm and calls for some further evaluation . This may need to be done by a paediatric neurologist or a paediatric occupational therapist ; your regular paediatrician can give you a referral for these . If no physical reason can be found for your daughter 's toe-walking , it should be corrected with therapy to prevent the cords in her legs from tightening any further . - Diane Sacks , paediatrician TODDLERS AND TV My husband watches adult television shows like CSI and Law &; Order around our two-year-old son . He says our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what we watch , but I disagree . What age should parents start limiting what kind of TV their kids are exposed to ? * It 's a good idea to prevent young children from being exposed to violence , whether it 's in real life or on television . Research shows that young children are not able to process the information they see on television in the same way as adults can . They do n't have the experience to place what they see in context or make critical judgments about it . After watching violence on TV , young kids can become aggressive or fearful , and they might expect that interactions in real life will be like the negative ones they see on TV . Start setting limits on your son 's TV viewing now , and you 'll find it 's easier to enforce those limits as your son gets older . Remember , two-yearolds are very social , so take advantage of this developmental stage . Rather than watching TV while your son is still awake , do something together as a family , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or game , or playing with toys . These activities will further your son 's development while strengthening your family bond . You can save the TV watching for after he has gone to bed . - Ruwa Sabbagh , psychotherapist STILL WEARING PULL-UPS Our four-year-old , who is fully potty trained , refuses to wear underpants . She is still wearing Puli-Ups . We try to encourage her to wear panties , telling her that she 's a big girl and that other girts wear them . When we do try to put panties on her , she cries and fights with us . Any suggestions ? * Although your daughter is fully trained , she may not trust herself . Maybe she had an accident and is worried it will happen again . Whatever is motivating her preference for PuIlUps , she clearly is not ready for panties and there 's no point fighting with her over what she 's wearing . So let her set the agenda . When she 's ready for panties , she will let you know . In the meantime , to keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new big-girl underwear , making sure she knows they can stay in her drawer until she wants to wear them , KL PIERCED EARS It 's a long-standing tradition for baby girls In my family to have their ears pierced , but I 'm wondering if there are medical reasons we should wait until our daughter is older . * I am generally a big fan of family traditions - but this one , not so much . If you have a choice , I would recommend delaying this until the child is old enough to care for the piercings herself . With any puncturing , there is the risk of infection ; however , if it 's done under sterile conditions by a technician with experience in piercing infants ' ears , and there is proper aftercare , the risk of problems is extremely low . Choose earrings with gold posts to decrease the chance of an allergic reaction . Then apply rubbing alcohol or antibiotic cream twice a day for a week or so to protect the site . Finally , the posts should be rotated each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new earrings should not be removed for at least four to six weeks . ( Feel free to write me again when your daughter is a teen and is piercing other body parts ! ) ds EXPECTANT AND FEARFUL My sister-in-law is expecting her first child , and she is so afraid of getting sick that she 's taken to going out as little as possible and even limiting the number of visits from family and friends . I do n't think this is healthy for anyone in that household . Can you give me some insight to pass along ? * Having a first baby is often both a joyful and quite stressful time for the pregnant mother , who may feel overwhelmed at the task of ensuring she and her baby survive the pregnancy and delivery . It sounds as if your sister-in-law is quite scared and may believe the actions she is taking are the most helpful for her and her unborn baby . If you 've had a baby yourself , you might reassuringly share your experience of being pregnant with her , particularly by recounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can help her by acknowledging any similar worries you had and encourage her to talk with you about her own fears . Be careful not to judge her feelings or decisions , and try to help her to see herself as strong and healthy enough to fight off whatever comes her way and keep her baby safe . You might suggest that she talk about her worries with her medical practitioner , who might in turn be able to recommend a mental health professional if it seems indicated . While this situation is causing you concern , ultimately you will have to respect your sister-in-law 's wishes . Take heart that a pregnancy lasts only nine months , and hopefully she will return to her usual self once she has the experience of delivering a happy , healthy baby . RS
