49 BINJAI PARK , OCTOBER 17 , 1910 <p> Herr Tierney lounges in the luxury of his English friend 's rattan chair , savoring a cigar . He sweats heavily , a bodily constant that frustrates the German doctor beyond English expression and civil conversation . <p> The sunset is splendid . A real bloody one , the sun eking out an operatic gasp in a last swoon over bougainvillea . Tierney savors that bit of theater , as well as the two gin and tonics that make the tragedy go down more easily . <p> With eyes half-closed , Tierney feels for his sweating glass on the white iron table to his left . It is a good time of day for the island , he reasons slurrily , better than the insufferable heat of noon , when his white pants stick to him like lychee juice . At his practice in Hamburg , Tierney took a special pride in the immaculate white of his doctor 's coat . Since moving to Singapore , however , ungainly sweat stains have grown to permanently discolor the coat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth-clenched scrubbing , oil soap in one hand , spotted coat in the other , can remove . <p> Earlier that day , mid-heat , Herr Tierney was examining his armpits in consternation when a foreigner unfamiliar to him entered the office with a stricken look and a sweeping gait . The man melted to the counter and looked a long while at Tierney before speaking haltingly in a French accent . <p> " Hello , excuse me , are you the doctor , I- " he began , so softly that Tierney was forced to lean over the counter to hear him . " I , I have it , I mean , how do you say , I have these bumps , and I have never seen this kind of bumps before . Maybe you know , maybe you have lived here a long time , and seen many things like this ? " <p> Tierney simply stared agape , unable to understand anything the man was saying . Since the man 's entrance , in fact , Tierney had only been able to focus on the light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth worked around its words : thin lips coming together , then parting delicately , gracefully mispronouncing each English word . <p> " My name is Monsieur Benoit , " the lips began again , after the pause impregnated by Tierney 's gaze became uncomfortable . " I have been in Singapore for one month only . I told Madame Bencouer , my cousin who is keeping me here , that I am having this terrible disease , and she says to come to you immediately , that it might be the dengue fever . " <p> " What 's that ? Dengue fever ? " Tierney stammered , confusedly , until he made the necessary connection . " Ah , yes . Madame Bencouer . Dengue fever . " The tall , well-endowed madame had sent him several dengue fever patients in the past , and a quick look at the shy Benoit in one of the clinic 's back rooms confirmed Tierney 's hunch . The symptoms inspiring the madame 's mistaken prognosis were , once again , merely mosquito bites . <p> " I am so sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said later as he paid for the visit . " I am just so nervous about being in this place with all of these sicknesses for the first time . When I wake up with all of these bumps , I think- " <p> " Please , call me Herr Tierney , not Doctor , " Tierney begged Benoit . When he left his practice in Germany ten years ago , Tierney had resolved to leave his doctor title there , too . The request typically unnerved Tierney 's first-time patients , who would rather their doctor feel more comfortable with the word " doctor . " But Benoit hardly blinked at the strange petition . <p> " Of course . And I am Monsieur Benoit , " the wonderful Benoit blushed and repeated , as Tierney , wide-eyed , watched him walk out . <p> Now , on his friend 's verandah in the growing dark , Tierney smiles at the memory of Benoit , making a note to inquire about the gentleman the next time he calls on the Bencouers . The man 's high forehead betrayed an intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baser aspects , such as the ludicrous medical assertion about dengue fever . <p> The more he thinks about Benoit , the more Tierney 's thick fingers itch to probe the French man 's scalp . An amateur phrenologist , Tierney is notorious for choosing subjects with uniquely shaped heads at expatriate parties , a practice that receives a mixed response from its audience . Usually Tierney finds Americans more enthusiastic about the experiment than other nationalities . <p> " Well , I never ! " the plump , red-ringletted Mrs. Williams giggled at the Tanglin Club last week , after Tierney pronounced her head similar in texture to some of Germany 's fiercest criminals . The Williams had moved from Chicago to Singapore six months earlier . <p> " Oh , but you must believe it , Mrs. Williams , " Tierney said dramatically , and a little loudly , sloshing red wine on the carpet . " Thanks to the hard research of an excellent German scientist 's experiments , we now know it is possible to determine different dispositions and , ah . . . what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . tendencies ! Yes , dispositions and tendencies , by the bumps on the head . " <p> A waiter passed by with a plate of little sausages , and Tierney paused in his lecture to take four . In between bites he continued . " Your head , dear lady " - bite-  " has the same grooves " - bite-  " as a cerain prner Friz , who murrerred hi wife . " <p> " What ? " his audience , a Swedish couple and Mr. and Mrs. Williams , demanded in one voice . <p> " For Pete 's sake , Doc , swallow your food first , " Mr. Williams said , with a look of disgust . Hal Williams was one of the youngest married men in Singapore 's expatriate circle , whose weakness for long lunches and young secretaries at the bank where he worked was already notorious among the circle 's gossips . <p> Tierney glared at the " Doc " reference before continuing , in an injured tone , " I simply said that your wife 's head bears a remarkable resemblance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who murdered his wife . Mrs. Williams 's head has organs of secretiveness and firmness that are quite largely developed . " <p> At this , the Swedish couple burst out laughing . Hal turned ashen and steered his wife to the food table . <p> On his friend 's dark porch now , Tierney scratches his own head . He feels a belch welling up from his constitution 's deepest caverns , and unabashedly lets it soar through the night . The eruption shakes his British host from a reverie involving his wife 's best friend in a swimsuit . <p> " What in God's- " the Englishman , known to close friends as Toddy , shouts , springing from his rattan chair as though a python has just been found under his hindquarters . Such a disaster did , in fact , take place precisely two weeks earlier , in the master bathroom , when Toddy 's children and wife heard his screams and ran to find a naked father and husband dancing over the tiles in panic , the black menace coiled meekly in the toilet bowl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone involved in the affair was sworn to secrecy at breakfast the next day , with severe threats of lashing if any of them ever mentioned it in public . Unfortunately , his wife , Helen , told Tierney about it the next day at lunch , and Tierney 's drunken presence at the British Officers ' Club party later that night resulted in the story 's widespread dissemination . <p> Annoyed at the resurfacing of the indignity 's memory , Toddy sits stiffly back down in his chair and reprimands his friend . " Just because we live in Asia does n't mean you have to act like a local , " he tells his guest in a high whine , to which Herr Tierney gives a small burp in apology . <p> TIERNEY 'S GOURMET , 222 ULU PANDAN ROAD , OCTOBER 17 , 2001 <p> " Emma , please . " Mrs. Walker sighs at her seven-year-old 's panties on display for the rest of the grocery store , the bottom half of the little girl 's Laura Ashley dress held above her head like a protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now keep it there . " She returns to the cereal aisle with her list . <p> Muesli or Mueslix ? Mrs. Walker racks her brains , does some research : reading the nutritional information on both boxes twice , then squinting at the pictures on the front . Emma frowns also , agonizing over all the potential grabbings the store presents . To take a pumpkin from Tierney 's Halloween display or a pear from the pile to her right ? She blinks in the glare of the store 's fluorescent light and moves in on the pears , her mother 's head bowed in indecision behind her . <p> Emma forces her hand in through pear cracks and grabs the fattest one . After a harrowing moment of tip , the pyramid topples . Oblong fruit crashes around Emma in folds , splatting and circling lazily around other customers ' feet . <p> " Emma ! " Mrs. Walker 's voice thunders over the Muzak . " What in God's- " <p> She grabs the wrist of Marie , the Walkers ' maid , who has been studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involuntary embrace . " You 're supposed to be watching her , " Mrs. Walker hisses . " You know how out of control she gets in this store . Please , Marie . I need your help here . Okay ? " <p> Marie fights out of the throes of the confidence . Nodding at Mrs. Walker , she edges backwards towards the pyramid of oranges that Ah Wei , the neurotic teenage daytime manager of Tierney 's , spent forty-five minutes stacking that morning . Luckily Marie catches herself before a second spill brings the unstable Ah Wei to the scene . His hopelessness at any level of emergency has only heightened Emma 's crises at Tierney 's in the past . Blissfully unaware of the pears spinning around the produce section , Ah Wei now sits perched in the personnel booth , listening to Chopin on his Discman , trying to calm himself with pre-calculus homework . <p> Emma , meanwhile , begins a tantrum at a noise level that perks the ears of old Mr. and Mrs. Cheong in Aisle 3 . <p> " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to- " <p> The sentence turns scream as her mother lifts her up like a small suitcase and deposits her in the grocery cart . Mrs. Walker resumes the shopping and wheels her daughter away , ignoring the spilled pears , abandoning the Muesli/Mueslix matrix . <p> Marie , behind the pair , glances desperately at the Filipino dried mangos as they pass them in Aisle 4 , everyone 's favorite aisle . In this hallowed corridor , narrow and gorged with sugar and foil , Emma panics over her need for Jolly Ranchers while Mrs. Walker discreetly indulges her habit of two gummy worms from the pick-a-mix . Were he still alive , it would undoubtedly be the favorite aisle of Herr Tierney himself , who prized above all other sweets the six different kinds of licorice on the third shelf of Aisle 4 , next to the jellybeans . <p> But neither Marie , nor Mrs. Walker , nor Emma , sees the six varieties of licorice via frozen foods . Only Ah Wei , who hates licorice , shakes his head as he stacks the packets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muzak on pause . For his part , Herr Tierney is in Hamburg , six feet underground and ten thousand kilometers from Singapore , as he has been for the past sixty years . <p> THE TANGLIN CLUB , 59 ORCHARD ROAD , OCTOBER 17 , 1910 <p> Tierney takes a deep breath before delivering the punch line : " Four Malays to kill it , three Chinese to bury it , and five hundred Indians , to bring it back to life ! " <p> The red faces and swinging diamonds surrounding Herr Tierney roar in appreciation at the joke . he is grateful for the response , knowing many of them have heard it before ; perhaps it was one of them who first told it to him . he worries momentarily about the Dutch ambassador 's wife , who is a Javanese woman of Chinese descent , but even she is showing teeth . Tierney does not notice her whisper a few terse words into the Dutch ambassador 's ear as soon as Tierney is caught in conversation by the British girl to his right . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , the one place where they can make you a shepherd 's pie , or a , sorry-where are you from ? " The girl speaks so quickly that Tierney asks her to repeat the question , and then , still uncomprehending , to repeat it one more time , a little slower . <p> " Ah . " Tierney catches it the third time . " Miss ... " <p> " Grout . " <p> " Miss Grout . If you had lived here as long as I have , you would know that the Chinese and Malaysian chefs at this place can not cook anything that is not Chinese or Malaysian . Any sort of German schnitzel-yes , I am from Hamburg- " Tierney plows on despite Miss Grout 's obvious desire to interject something about Germany . " Or even Italian pasta , I 'm afraid , is out of the question . Much better to go with the Shanghai noodles or the shark 's fin soup . " <p> Miss Grout wrinkles her nose in disgust and rams half a roll into her mouth . Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have simply fallen in love with mahjong ! " Miss Grout persists , to the back of Tierney 's head . Tierney ignores the comment and steels himself to frustrate the rest of the girl 's attempts at conversation for the remainder of the evening . <p> Luckily , an American diplomat , a Mr. Kent , on his left , proves a much more entertaining dinner companion . <p> " Are you a poker man , Tierney ? " Kent asks , with a sideways grin on his face . <p> " I have been known to play a few cards . " Tierney finds himself smiling easily back at Kent , mainly out of relief that he has escaped conversation , for now , with Miss Grout . <p> " Well , I tell you what , me and some of the other boys have a real good time ... there 's a few of us who get together a couple times a week and play a round or two at the Imperial Room they got here . " <p> Kent leans back in his chair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games I played in Hong Kong , whew ! Nice rooms , real nice , with drinks and girls , and real good players , too . Now , the last time I was there , this one Indian guy , dressed real fancy , some kind of prince or something , shows up , and I tell you what , I did n't think that guy was gon na know an ace of hearts from a two of spades , but he beat the pants off of all of us other guys , and straight , too . Oh , you shoulda seen the look on the face of one poor little French fella , real small , who lost five hundred dollars that night to Rahambooley or Rattatula or however the hell you say it . " <p> Kent takes a gulp of his wine , then goes on . " But you know , after watching that prince up close the next couple of nights , I think I picked up on his strategy , his game plan . " Kent lowers his voice to a whisper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . Bluffing each hand sounds imbecilic to Herr Tierney , but he is enjoying Kent 's company so much he simply changes the topic as quickly as he can . <p> " Will you be joining us on our next hunt in Malaysia , Mr. Kent ? " Tierney asks , certain that Kent is the type to go in for the melodrama of a tiger hunt . Although Tierney despises the affairs-sweating through what feels like a full-body khaki corset , enduring long tramps through the jungle , sleeping fitfully in some British civil servant 's hill station house before rising at dawn the next day-he considers the expeditions critical in assuring his social prowess , and has never turned down an invitation . <p> Kent considers the question for five chews of steak , then swallows and replies . " I do n't think so , old man , but thanks . There 's a delegation from Japan arriving this weekend , and next week my wife and I are entertaining friends from home who are on a tour of Asia . The wife would never forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants . " Kent whistles . " Tierney , I tell you what , I have never seen Betty get so angry at anyone the way she gets at some of these local fellas we 've got working for us at the house . Now I tell her that everyone 's got their own culture and their own way of doing things , and if it runs in their blood to be damn lazy it 's not their fault . But you 've got to draw a line somewhere . We had to let our kitchen boy go last week for being smart back to Betty about cleaning dishes . I tell you what , it 's hard for our women here . You married , Tierney ? " <p> Tierney shakes his head . <p> " Well , sometimes I think that 's the way to do it . Hell , I 'm starting to think that old Millford 's got the right idea . " <p> They both look over in the direction of Edward Millford , a rubber exporter who spends half the year at home in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half traveling , with ten women in every port , or so the gossips say . Kent shakes his head as he and Tierney witness Millford simultaneously pat the knee of Eleanor Smithwick , the seventeen-year-old daughter of the British ambassador , and engage in deep conversation with the ravishing Mrs. Giorgio to his left . <p> Just as Tierney opens his mouth to try and change Kent 's mind about the hunt , a gentle brushing by his ankle gives him pause . he leans under the table to shoo away the fat cat that often haunts the Club 's dining rooms . In the murky light of an under-tablecloth world , Herr Tierney gasps in horror at the discovery : the touch on his heel is none other than the toe of the awful British girl next to him . he stares unbelievingly at the uninvited thing massaging his foot . As though underwater , he distantly hears her nasal voice droning nonchalantly to Mrs. Adhiwiyogo at the table above , her high-heeled shoe abandoned on the floor next to Tierney 's nose and a bit of shepherd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 , 2007 <p> Mrs. Walker 's slender heel eases onto the brakes as the sleek Mercedes pulls up at the gate . After a few false starts with the remote control , the car glides into the driveway like a seal coming ashore , dripping with the ten-minute shower that had pounded the windshield all the way home from Tierney 's Gourmet . <p> " Emma , do n't just run to the house , give us a hand with the groceries , please . " <p> Mrs. Walker swings her hip around to close the car door and hands the keys to Marie . " Marie , go ahead and start unloading these bags inside , will you ? There 's something I need to tell the gardener before he leaves . " <p> Mrs. Walker approaches the old Indian man , who is bent double over a bougainvillea bush , pulling a weed from the damp earth . he hears her crashing through the jungle grass and looks up skeptically . Conversation between them has no real precedent . <p> " Hello , Mr. Rahamtullah , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I just have a question about the orchids on the back porch . They 're not looking great , and I wondered if you could try and do something with them . " <p> " Orchids , orchids , " Mr. Rahamtullah mutters . It is not his business to tend to the orchids . They had agreed four months ago that he would work solely on the yard and the potted plants around the pool , not anything on the porches or inside the house . She went so far as to draw him a map , which he keeps in a bureau drawer at home . Every now and then he takes it out and shakes his head at the carefully penciled sketch , amazed at how far irrelevant attention to detail can go in a woman like Mrs. Walker . <p> He nods his head now at her latest request and bends down again to finish weeding . <p> " Oh , and- " She is making starting-talking noises . he heard the same noises coming from his wife that morning at breakfast , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way that he now bends over the bougainvillea and ignores Mrs. Walker . he uses this strategy for all women making starting sounds , and it works better on Mrs. Walker than it did on his wife at breakfast , as Mrs. Walker soon stops making starting sounds and starts speaking in whole sentences . <p> " We 're going to be leaving on Sunday to go back to America for Christmas , " she blurts . " Please come work as usual on Tuesday , and we will pay you as soon as we get back . " <p> Mr. Rahamtullah grunts . Mrs. Walker can not decide whether the noise is directed towards the weed he is pulling or made as an affirmation of her remark . <p> " Excuse me , Mr. Rahamtullah . I would appreciate it if you would just look me in the face when I 'm talking to you ? " <p> Mr. Rahamtullah 's face rears up then , stony as Emma 's after Mrs. Walker has made a motherly request that unwittingly carries some sort of personal injury . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker lies weakly , after a century of awful eye contact passes between them . " For the beautiful job that you 've done on our flowers out front . " She flees then , tripping slightly over the grass in her high heels . Mr. Rahamtullah sees her flowered dress safely inside the door . Then he sits down in the shade of a rain tree , and takes a long sip of water from his large plastic Coke bottle . <p> 8 UTONG PATAR STREET , OCTOBER 17 , 1910 <p> Herr Tierney lies sprawled across his hammock on his own verandah . A glass of gin lies overturned underneath him , the liquid already summoning a long line of six-legged pilgrims . Cocooned helplessly in the rocking rope , Tierney takes deep and voluminous gulps of night air heady with the scent of orchids . His bleary vision sees double moths in the lamplight , and he breathes dizzily , trying to shake off the memory of the coatroom incident at the Tanglin club two hours earlier . <p> He was emerging from the bathroom , blowing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Tierney found himself tugged into the confines of the coatroom , face-to-face with the by now infamous Miss Grout . She was breathing heavily , and her hair was mussed . <p> She had the advantage of surprise on Tierney , and with surprising force for her thin frame she shoved him in between a mink coat and a silk wrap . Tierney gagged at the overwhelming perfume scents both garments reeked , and lightheadedly spiraled , then crashed with a thunk onto the floor . The girl evidently took this as a sign of compliance , and threw herself onto Tierney , kissing his brow and running trembling fingers along his torso , calling him such contradictory endearments as " my poor little doctor " and " my big fat German man . " <p> As soon as his hindquarters hit the floor of the coatroom , Tierney regained full consciousness . Placing the frantic British woman to the side as one would a small cat , Tierney stood up , the silk wrap draped over his right shoulder like a military decoration . <p> Before Grout could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook and fled the Tanglin Club , stumbling the two miles back to his house . <p> Now fully escaped from the girl and the clinging coats , Tierney lies in his hammock and groans. he moves with a huge heave to rest on his side , feeling the hammock 's knots press into his fleshy torso and throbbing head . he suddenly regrets the absence of clothing between himself and the rope . <p> This state of nature is not unusual for Herr Tierney at home , though he normally avoids the hammock when unclothed . He delights most in patrolling the house as he was born : his bare beer belly and its enormous brown birthmark on display for all the geckos and ants crowding his cabinets . <p> Tierney kept servants for a time , but they all quit after he refused to clothe himself around the house . he would not even stoop to trying on the sarong that one of his maids , an older Indonesian woman named Astari , begged him to wear . <p> " God made cold countries for civilized people to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaim to no one in particular , but loud enough for everyone on the first floor to hear , " and the same Great Mind made tropical climates for the mad races , who cover themselves needlessly with heathen scraps of cloth , and force every rational man from the cold countries who comes here to go mad and wear clothes as well . Leaving it up to good Christian doctors like myself to come here , sacrificing a good life in Germany , with family , and friends ... " <p> Here Herr Tierney would taper off , bobbing mindlessly in seas of homesickness and nostalgia , until the inevitable resurfacing of Herr Miller 's memory . Miller , a rival since grade school , had ruined Tierney 's practice in Hamburg with a few choice accusations about the doctor 's sex life , which then made a Berlin cousin who could secure Tierney a liner ticket to Singapore within the month extremely useful . <p> At this painful recollection , the repatriated doctor would break his reverie and resume his lecture to the servants or , in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not permit any of you , " he would say , even louder than before , " to drive me mad enough to put on clothes in a country hot as hell . My poor mother would cry like she did the day I left Germany to think that her youngest son has lost his mind on this goddamn island . " <p> With the cook , the maid , and the driver departed , Tierney finds himself without anyone to prepare his mangoes in the morning , or bring him his Straits Times , or a back massage at five o'clock . he relies instead on the generosity of the expat community , who communally pities the lone German , and enjoys talking about him as soon as he leaves their houses . Tierney stays with various friends for days on end before he regains the courage to return to his overgrown bungalow , steaming among the vines , jackfruit trees , and an old British predecessor 's forgotten orchids . It is not so much the chaos of the garden or the dishes or the unkempt rooms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has developed a mossy , moldy , rat-poison , ripe-fruit odor that turns his stomach as soon as he is halfway up the driveway . <p> Suddenly , through the discomfort of his own sweat , the rope 's unrelenting hold on his flesh , and the incoherence of his drunken mind , Tierney inhales a heavenly odor that causes him to struggle to sit up in the hammock . Such gropings , however , do nothing , and he fights in the twine like a man drowning , until a soft voice from across the porch arrests all motion . <p> " Herr Tierney ? " <p> Tierney gasps at the unmistakable French accent . he can barely make out a blurry human figure next to the stone Buddha statue that he purchased in Siam six months ago . <p> " This is too rude . I am so embarrassed , to come here now , to your home , when you are not working , but I am really afraid that there is such a big matter here that maybe it can not wait until morning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have only come to Singapore to see my cousin and to buy some things to take back to my shop in Paris . " <p> Tierney hears a half-choking sound , a combination of sob and gasp , from the shadow . he shakes his head , sucking in the night air to summon some sobriety . The humidity , however , does nothing for his drunken state but add to his lightheadedness . Tierney 's eyes widen as the man begins moving towards the hammock . <p> " It is just this terrible thing with itching and skin coming off that I have had since early this evening , Herr , and I do not know what to do . " <p> An elbow is thrust in Tierney 's face . In the moonlight , Tierney can barely see the peeling skin , clearly from nothing more serious than a bad sunburn . But before he can reassure Benoit with the news and prescribe aloe , he finds his lips acting autonomously , not forming words but pressing against Benoit 's hot skin and , disregarding mosquito bites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . Benoit does not move , but three minutes later , murmurs , " J'ai craque ! " and tumbles into the hammock with Tierney . <p> 569 GALLOP ROAD , SINGAPORE , OCTOBER 17 , 2001 <p> When the phone rings , Mrs. Walker jumps and the Scotch she is pouring sloshes onto the counter that Marie should have , but did not , wipe down this morning . Watching Marie cleaning the car outside , Mrs. Walker makes a mental note to remind her once again of her kitchen duties . She picks up the phone and sighs into the mouthpiece . <p> " Hello ? " <p> " It 's Dave . " <p> " Hi . " <p> " Look , I 'm running a little late at the office , but I should still be back in time for dinner . Do you think Marie can hold it until 7:45 ? " <p> " Mmm .

" <p> " Well , Emma had swimming lessons at the Tanglin Club until four , and then we picked up some groceries at Tierney 's . " <p> " Sounds like fun . " <p> " Mmm . " Mrs. Walker is suddenly desperate to end the call . " Okay , Dave , see you around eight , then . Oh , and Dave-do n't forget to ask John Singh about the flights for Christmas . " <p> " Right .

She moves from the table to retrieve a House magazine , proceeding up aqua-carpeted stairs into the master bedroom . The magazines lie in a heap to the left of the bed , on top of a large Tupperware container . <p> Mrs. Walker picks them up , frowning , and looks for a label on the container . She prides herself on a permanent-marker masking-tape system that has organized all of the Walker odds and ends on each of their fifteen moves in the past twenty years of marriage . <p> This container is unlabeled , however , so she opens the lid , and finds pictures . Of course . She remembers tossing them in this container last January , to get the bedroom ready for a friend coming to housesit . <p> She starts sifting through the prints now , recollecting the vacation in Phuket last Christmas , Emma sunburned and saronged , David 's arm around the waitress . They had been forced to veto a couple of Christmas card pictures due to the presence of a Thai or Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures as well . Mrs. Walker gives a short dry laugh , drains her glass , and looks through the pictures more swiftly , Singapore blurring into Germany two years ago and trips to the Alps , then Sweden the year before that , the two years in Texas ... A startling joke shot of herself , veiled , in Dubai , where they had spent six months in ' 92 , then home for the summer at her parents ' house , then Christmas at David 's parents ' house , Emma grinning on a horse at summer camp in North Carolina . <p> She gets to the last of the heap and begins to replace the lid when she notices some larger prints at the bottom of the box . The first is an ambitious shot of forest , black and white , intentionally blurry . Unbelievable . Mrs. Walker grins like Emma at the memory . Her photography class in college , the year before she met David . <p> Most of the pictures are fuzzy , earnestly artistic attempts to express the sidewalk at Sarah Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker comes across five stuck together . She carefully peels the first one off the top-an upsidedown shot of her roommate , Grace , naked on the bed-and sucks in her breath at the shot below . It 's Mrs. Walker , then Claire Burney , posing in the dorm , in a boyfriend 's sweatshirt , long , dark hair down , face pale from the New York winter , eyes staring unabashed at the camera she holds . Mrs. Walker resists the sentimental pricks at the back of her eyes that the alcohol , more than anything , is urging . She tries to scrape herself off the top , and the picture rips in two . She can only make out paw prints in the snow on half of the picture below . <p> A noise from the bathroom distracts her , the sounds of shattering glass and rustling papers . Emma , Mrs. Walker intuits . She shoves the pictures off of her lap and hurries to the door of the bathroom , where she freezes . <p> Two monkeys perch on top of the sink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other is shitting on David 's hand towel .

She takes a deep breath , then motions to it , hissing , " Go ! Go ! Get ! " The monkeys do n't move . The two sides stare at each other for a tense twenty seconds . " Get the fuck out of my bathroom ! " Mrs. Walker finally yells , her voice breaking in the middle . The vandals screech weakly and leave , hopping and sliding a little over the tiles . <p> Mrs. Walker takes one long step to the window once they are gone , and locks it . She goes to the mirror and begins touching up her mascara , sees that the monkeys have ruined her favorite talcum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty tub and sinks into it , starts crying . She cries the way Emma did when David killed a gecko on the porch , the first week after they moved to Singapore . <p> 8 UTONG PATAR STREET , SINGAPORE , OCTOBER 18 , 1910 <p> When Tierney awakes the next morning , he finds himself sprawled across the old tennis court in his front lawn , drooling onto the clay . he wipes his mouth quickly . Benoit is throwing bits of the decaying court at monkeys gathered on the other side . He waves at Tierney and comes to his side of the court . As he approaches , Tierney , wincing through a hangover worsened by sleeping on a clay court for four hours , notices that Benoit has on his bathrobe , a Christmas present from Tierney 's father the year before he left Hamburg . <p> " Oh . " Benoit glances down at the bathrobe in response to Tierney 's inquisitive look . he sits down cross-legged next to the befuddled German . " I , ah , I found it in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ! Come ! " Benoit springs up playfully . " I have made a breakfast dans la portique . " <p> Tierney follows him in a daze . he is trying to recollect what day it is , if patients are expecting him ; he does not think of last night , fearful of what he may recollect . <p> The porch is laden with all sorts of imperishable goods Tierney had forgotten for years in the moldy cabinets : canned peaches , canned cherries , licorice from home , oatmeal . he notes a large jackfruit on the table with raised eyebrows . <p> " I bet you did not even know you had that fruit ! " Benoit says . <p> Tierney , overwhelmed by the proceedings , can do nothing but sit down and begin to eat breakfast as though he and Benoit share the meal every morning , the tennis court each night . he begins to ask Benoit to pass the tin of cashews when they both hear the rumble of a car in the driveway . It stalls a few times on its approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested midair , dripping slowly onto the table . Tierney waits for the liquid to pool , then rises abruptly to meet the visitor . <p> The groaning hotchkiss does not even bother stopping in front of the house , but pulls up right next to the porch . Toddy steps out , shrieking wildly . Tierney takes one look and , not bothering to explain to Toddy the breakfast , Benoit , or his own bareness , sprints to the back bedroom . <p> Tierney finds the bottle he is looking for and huffs back out . Toddy is lying on the tile floor , breathing shallowly . <p> Benoit looks as panicked as the first day he met Tierney . " Mon dieu ! The man fainted as soon as you left ! " Tierney takes a glass of water from the table and throws it in Toddy 's face . Toddy sits up , sputtering , and silently swallows the two pills that Tierney hands him . <p> " Now , old boy , do us a favor and go and lie down in the back bedroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a polite nod to Benoit , then stands up trancelike and leaves the porch . <p> " Do n't worry about him , he is fine , " Tierney tells the openmouthed Benoit . " But before he wakes up , I suggest that you hide yourself or put some clothes on and go home , so that I can tell Toddy , if he mentions it , that it was his very high fever that imagined you here . Otherwise Toddy will talk to his wife , who will talk to every foreigner on this goddamn island , and I will become a grocer or a garbage man after all of my patients refuse to see a doctor who eats his breakfast with an equally indiscreet Frenchman . " <p> " Of course , " whispers Benoit , his eyes on the spot where Toddy lay two minutes earlier . " But what about your British friend , will he be all right ? " <p> " No question , " pronounces Tierney . " It is more of a mental affliction than a real injury . After Toddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been running over here , convinced that he is bitten by a snake , when it is really just an ant bite or a bump into furniture , or something unpleasant that his wife has said . It is impossible to argue with him and , as his friend , quite disturbing to witness . I am more of a phrenologist than a psychologist , but I would say that most foreigners in Singapore suffer from some form of hypochondria . " <p> At this Benoit blushes and looks away . <p> " I give my patients , " Tierney continues , " more placebos and sleeping pills than I like to admit . That 's why our friend Toddy will be sleeping very soundly in just a few minutes . " <p> Benoit gets up from the table and looks at Tierney in awe . <p> " You are an incredible man , one of the most wonderful men I have ever met . When can I see you again ? " <p> " Do you go with Madame Bencouer to the Tanglin Club ? " <p> Benoit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreigner there as well , sometimes more than when I am out in the street , you know , near the fishermen , in a local market , watching people . " <p> Tierney shakes his head in consternation . " They are a mad race here , and it is better for you to avoid contact with locals as much as possible . I am telling you this as your doctor . But it is up to you , of course . And , I think , if we are very careful , we can continue this habit of , how would you call it , rendezvous ? " <p> Benoit blushes and runs to Tierney. he holds the huge man in his trembling arms , sighs , lets go . " Yes , Doctor . I will come and have a wonderful can breakfast with you again soon . " Then he picks up his clothes from off the floor and walks out of the driveway , naked , with the clothes bundle in one hand , pausing every now and then to extract gravel from his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back bedroom . He gives his sleeping friend a light pat on the back . <p> " Well , Toddy , I am going to get ready for the day . " He notices an ant crawling across the man 's face and generously squishes it onto his forehead . " I hope we will be seeing you looking more lively when I return . " <p> 569 GALLOP ROAD , SINGAPORE , OCTOBER 17 , 2001 <p> " When 's Daddy coming home ? " Emma asks , as she dunks her spring roll into soy sauce , watches it absorb the liquid , putting up a few air bubbles in protest , then drown in the shallow Chinese bowl . <p> Mrs. Walker looks up from her food and , as usual , responds more sharply than she intends . " I do n't know , Emma , I already told you that . He said he would be here at quarter to eight . " <p> Emma takes a few noodles and swings them experimentally from her chopsticks , bored . She spies a gecko on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closer look at the creature . Her sock feet slip on the slick marble , and she falls , knocking her head against the Chinese dresser on the way down . <p> Mrs. Walker gets up from the table when she hears Emma 's wail , and bends down over the sniffling seven-year-old . " Emma , if you 'd just take a second to think . Here . " She gives her a hand and uses a soy-sauced napkin to wipe away the tears . " Now , is your head okay ? Just a little bump . " <p> Emma hiccups a yes , drawing raggedy breaths . " I want Marie . " <p> " What ? " <p> " I want Marie . I wan na watch TV with Marie . " <p> " No , Emma , you need to finish your dinner first . " <p> " Finished . " <p> " Well , I do n't think it 's a good idea . " Mrs. Walker sorely resents the TV they gave to Marie last Christmas . " How about we watch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want Marie ! " Emma begins crying again , but in an angrier tone , when she sees her mother 's frown . " I want Marie ! " <p> As the screams escalate , Mrs. Walker surrenders . " Fine . Fine . " <p> She sits back down at the table , and the little girl trots out of the dining room . <p> The long pine table seems to go on forever . Mrs. Walker sighs and turns up the dial that controls the brightness of the chandelier as far as it can go . She takes a Good Housekeeping from the table , sits down , and starts flipping through recipes for Christmas cookies and pages of American family holiday activities : snowing , skiing , caroling . She wonders if David remembered to ask about the tickets home . She suddenly recalls the way David acted around his secretary at the company 's holiday party last year , and shivers . She examines her watch . 9:30 p.m . " Damn it , Dave , " she whispers at the mirror across the dining hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . <p> She takes the glass to the living room , grabbing the day 's mail on the way , and spreads it out on the sofa . Bill , bill , ad , Christmas card , and " The Weekly Expat . " Inside the publication is a small feature on an American Women 's Association trip to the Malaysian rain forest , and a page promoting the annual Tanglin Club Halloween Party . She skips to the back and checks the mahjong time at the Club next week , then notes a small ad taken out by Tierney 's Gourmet in the lower right-hand corner . <p> Get your Thanksgiving Turkey before it 's too late ! American turkeys flown in , 100% white meat , the REAL taste of home ! Below it is the price and the Tierney 's icon , two mustached men in aprons waving at the reader . <p> Tierney and Benoit , cartoons on the page looking at Mrs. Walker , do not feel alive . Tierney does not sweat , and Benoit does not smile . Their glossy resemblances are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . Unbreathing , the three watch each other uneasily until Mrs. Walker takes the wine upstairs to the master bedroom , draws a bath , and calls her sister in Michigan . <p>
