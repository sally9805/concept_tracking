Debut // March 18 , 1939. // In a studio on West 46th Street in New York City , a band was playing Rimsky-Korsakov 's " Flight of the Bumblebee . " It was a simple place , a room with couches and lamps , hung with drapes to muffle the echo from the walls . This was a big day for the musicians , who were recording for the first time . // A skinny young man listened as they played . The previous night , at the Sicilian Club near his home in New Jersey , he had asked if he could tag along . Now , as the band finished playing , he stepped forward and spoke to the bandleader . " May I sing ? " he asked . // The bandleader glanced at the studio clock to see if they had time left , then told the young man to go ahead . He chose " Our Love , " a stock arrangement based on a melody from Tchaikovsky 's Romeo and Juliet . Standing at the rudimentary microphone , he launched into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it everywhere Our love is like an evening prayer ... I see your face in stars above , As I dream on , in all the magic of Our love . // Unseasoned , a little reedy , the voice was transmitted through an amplifier to a recording device known as a lathe . The lathe drove the sound to a needle , and the needle carved a groove on a twelve-inch aluminum-based lacquer disc . The result was a record , to be played on a turntable at seventy-eight revolutions per minute . // The bandleader kept the record in a drawer for nearly sixty years . He would take it out from time to time , with delight and increasing nostalgia , to play for friends . The music on it sounds tinny , a relic of the infancy of recording technology . Yet the disc is kept in a locked safe . The attorney for the bandleader 's widow , an octogenarian on Social Security , says the singer 's heirs have demanded all rights and the lion 's share of any potential income derived from it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable piece of musical history . Its tattered adhesive label , typed with an old manual machine , shows the recording was made at Harry Smith Studios , " electrically recorded " for bandleader Frank Mane . Marked " #1 Orig. , " it is the very first known studio recording of the thousand and more that were to make that skinny young man the most celebrated popular singer in history . For , under " Vocal chor. by , " it bears the immaculately handwritten legend : // Frank Sinatra // A year after making that first record , at twenty-five , Sinatra told a new acquaintance how he saw his future . " I 'm going to be the best singer in the world , " he said , " the best singer that ever was . " // A Family from Sicily // Io sono Siciliano ... " I am Sicilian. // At the age of seventy-one , in the broiling heat of summer in 1987 , Frank Sinatra was singing , not so well by that time , in the land of his fathers . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Palermo 's Favorita Stadium , " that I love you dearly for coming tonight . I have n't been in Italy for a long time-I 'm so thrilled . I 'm very happy . " // The crowd roared approval , especially when he said he was Sicilian , that his father was born in Sicily . Sinatra 's voice cracked a little as he spoke , and he looked more reflective than happy . At another concert , in the northern Italian city of Genoa , he had a joke for his audience . " Two very important and wonderful people came from Genoa , " he quipped . " One ... Uno : Christopher Columbus . Due : mia Mamma ... " // This second crowd cheered , too , though a little less enthusiastically when he mentioned that his father was Sicilian . " I do n't think , " he said wryly , " that they 're too thrilled about Sicilia . " It was a nod to northern Italians ' feelings about the island off the southernmost tip of the country . They look down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as all the world knows , it is synonymous with organized crime . It is the island of fire and paradox , the dismembered foot of the leg of Italy . Sicily : at ten thousand square miles the largest island in the Mediterranean , a cornucopia of history that remains more remote and mysterious than anywhere in Europe . // The island 's story has been a saga of violence . Its ground heaved to earthquakes , and its volcanoes spat fire and lava , long before Christ . Its population carries the genes of Greeks and Romans , of Germanic Vandals and Arabs , of Normans and Spaniards , all of them invaders who wrote Sicily 's history in blood . // " Sicily is ungovernable , " Luigi Barzini wrote . " The inhabitants long ago learned to distrust and neutralize all written laws . " Crime was endemic , so alarmingly so that a hundred years ago the island 's crime rate was said to be the worst in Europe . By then , the outside world had already heard the spectral name that has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that word is as much a mystery as the criminal brotherhood itself , but in Sicily " mafia " has one meaning and " Mafia " - with an upper case " M " - another . For the islanders , in Barzini 's view , the word " mafia " was originally used to refer to " a state of mind , a philosophy of life , a concept of society , a moral code . " At its heart is marriage and the family , with strict parameters . Marriage is for life , divorce unacceptable and impossible . // A man with possessions or special skills was deemed to have authority , and known as a padrone . In " mafia " with a small " m , " those who lived by the code and wielded power in the community were uomini rispettati , men of respect . They were supposed to behave chivalrously , to be good family men , and their word was their bond . They set an example , and they expected to be obeyed . // The corruption of the code and the descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth century , the Mafia with a capital " M , " though never exactly an organization , was levying tribute from farmers , controlling the minimal water supply , the builders and the businessmen , fixing prices and contracts . // Cooperation was enforced brutally . Those who spoke out in protest were killed , whatever their station in life . The Mafia made a mockery of the state , rigging elections , corrupting the politicians it favored , and terrorizing opponents . From 1860 to 1924 , not a single politician from Sicily was elected to the Italian parliament without Mafia approval . The island and its people , as one early visitor wrote , were " not a dish for the timid . " // Frank Sinatra 's paternal grandfather grew up in Sicily in the years that followed the end of foreign rule , a time of social and political mayhem . His childhood and early adult years coincided with the collapse of civil authority , brutally suppressed uprisings , and the rise of the Mafia to fill the power vacuum . // Beyond that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background in Sicily . The grandfather 's obituary , which appeared in the New York Times because of his famous grandson , merely had him born " in Italy " in 1884 ( though his American death certificate indicates he was born much earlier , in 1866 ) . Twice , in 1964 and in 1987 , Frank Sinatra told audiences that his family had come from Catania , about as far east as one can go in Sicily . Yet he told one of his musicians , principal violist Ann Barak , that they came from Agrigento on the southwestern side of the island . His daughter Nancy , who consulted her father extensively while working on her two books about his life , wrote that her great-grandfather had been " born and brought up " in Agrigento . His name , according to her , was John . // In fact he came from neither Catania nor Agrigento , was born earlier than either of the dates previously reported , and his true name was Francesco-in the American rendering , Frank . // Sicilian baptismal and marriage records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surviving grandchildren establish that Francesco Sinatra was born in 1857 in the town of Lercara Friddi , in the hills of northwest Sicily . It had about ten thousand inhabitants and it was a place of some importance , referred to by some as piccolo Palermo , little Palermo . // The reason was sulfur , an essential commodity in the paper and pharmaceutical industries , in which Sicily was rich and Lercara especially so . Foreign companies reaped the profits , however , and most locals languished in poverty . The town was located , in the words of a prominent Italian editor , in " the core territory of the Mafia . " The town lies fifteen miles from Corleone , a name made famous by The Godfather and in real life a community credited with breeding more future American mafiosi than any other place in Sicily . It is just twelve miles from the Mafia stronghold of Prizzi-as in Prizzi 's Honor , the Richard Condon novel about the mob and the film based on it that starred Jack Nicholson . // It was Lercara Friddi , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . Francesco Sinatra 's hometown spawned Lucky Luciano . Luciano was " without doubt the most important Italian-American gangster , " according to one authority , and " head of the Italian underworld throughout the land , " according to a longtime head of the Chicago Crime Commission . One of his own lawyers described him as having been , quite simply , " the founder of the modern Mafia . " // Luciano , whose real name was Salvatore Lucania , was born in Lercara Friddi in 1897 . Old marriage and baptismal registers show that his parents and Francesco Sinatra and his bride , Rosa Saglimbeni , were married at the church of Santa Maria della Neve within two years of each other . Luciano was baptized there , in the same font as Francesco 's first two children . // In all the years of speculation about Frank Sinatra 's Mafia links , this coincidence of origin has remained unknown . Other new information makes it very likely that the Sinatras and the Lucanias knew each other . The two families lived on the same short street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . Luciano 's address book , seized by law enforcement authorities on his death in 1962 and available today in the files of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , contains only two entries for individuals who lived in Lercara Friddi : one a member of his own family and the other a man named Saglimbeni , a relative of the woman Francesco Sinatra married . Even if the Sinatras and the Lucanias did not know each other , Luciano 's later notoriety makes it certain that the Sinatra family eventually learned that they and the gangster shared the same town of origin . Kinship and origins are important in Italian-American culture , and were even more so in the first decades of the diaspora . // As a boy , Frank Sinatra could have learned from any of several older relatives that his people and Luciano came from the same Sicilian town . He certainly should have learned it from Francesco , who lived with Sinatra 's family after his wife 's death and often minded his grandson when the boy 's parents were out . // Francesco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after Luciano had become an infamous household name and Frank Sinatra an internationally famous singer . Sinatra himself indicated , and a close contemporary confirmed , that he and his grandfather were " very close . " Late in life , he said he had gone out of his way to " check back " on his Sicilian ties . And yet , as we have seen , he muddied the historical waters by suggesting that his forebears came from Sicilian towns far from Lercara Friddi. // That the Sinatra family came from the same town as a top mafioso was not in itself a cause for embarrassment . The reason for the obfuscation , though , may be found in the family involvement with bootlegging in Frank Sinatra 's childhood and , above all , in his own longtime relationship with Luciano himself , the extent of which can now be documented for the first time . // * * * // There was only one school in Lercara Friddi , and few people there could read or write . Francesco Sinatra was no exception , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a local woman his own age , when both were in their early twenties , and by the time they turned thirty , in 1887 , the couple had two sons . As the century neared its close , thousands of Sicilians were going hungry , especially in the countryside . There were food riots , and crime was rampant . // In western Sicily , the Mafia 's power had become absolute . Palermo , the island 's capital , spawned the first capo di tutti capi , Don Vito , who would one day forge the first links between the Sicilian Mafia and the United States . His successor , Don Carlo , operated from a village just fourteen miles from Lercara Friddi . Some of the most notorious American mob bosses-Tony Accardo , Carlo Gambino , Sam Giancana , Santo Trafficante-were , like Luciano , of western Sicilian parentage. // By 1889 Francesco and Rosa had moved to a working-class suburb of Palermo . Two more sons were born there , but died in infancy , possibly victims of the cholera epidemic that ravaged the neighborhood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to leave the island in the next twenty-five years , many going to Argentina and Brazil and , increasingly , to the United States . // Francesco Sinatra joined the exodus in the summer of 1900 . At the age of forty-three , he said goodbye to Rosa and their surviving children-there were by now three sons and two daughters-and boarded a ship for Naples . There he transferred to the British steamer Spartan Prince , carrying a steerage ticket to New York . At Ellis Island , on July 6 , he told immigration officials he planned to stay with a relative living on Old Broadway in Manhattan . He had $30 in his pocket . // Francesco found work , and soon had enough confidence to start sending for his family . His eldest son , Isidor , joined him in America , and Salvatore , just fifteen and declaring himself a shoemaker like his father , arrived in 1902 . Rosa arrived at Christmas the following year , accompanied by Antonino , age nine , and their two daughters , Angelina and Dorotea , who were younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America-was to father the greatest popular singer of the century . // The Statue of Liberty smiled , Frank Sinatra would say in an emotional moment forty years later , when his father " took his first step on Liberty 's soil . " For many Italian newcomers , however , the smile proved illusory. //
