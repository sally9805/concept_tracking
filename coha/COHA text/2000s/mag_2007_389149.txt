INVENTOR : STUART MINICA **34;4416;TOOLONG Makes archers stealthier and more accurate with some well-placed magnets **27;4452;TOOLONG Air-Rest COST TO **30;4481;TOOLONG $50,000 **27;4513;TOOLONG 6 year **30;4542;TOOLONG PROTOTYPE PRODUCT 5 Stuart Minica spies a white-tailed buck 30 yards away , silently raises his bow , takes aim , and illustrates a problem that 's plagued archers since the bow was invented . As the arrow slides along the rest , leaving the bow with a noisy thwack , the deer starts and instantly disappears into the underbrush . An arrow rest , which keeps the arrow level until its release , creates noisy friction that slows the arrow and spooks the game . Fed up , Minica , a 31-year-old mechanical engineer who lives near San Antonio , Texas , devised a way to simply float the arrow in midair instead . His Air-Rest uses a powerful but light wraparound neodymium magnet , which reacts with a magnetic insert that can be glued into the hollow of a standard arrow . As the arrow is drawn , it slides noiselessly on a piece of felt until the magnets interact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air-Rest for several months , " says Kelly Garmon , the owner of HawgLite , an online archery-accessory company . " When I go hog-hunting now , I do n't miss a shot . " It may not create bull's-eye shooters overnight , says Anthony Licata , deputy editor of Field &; Stream magazine , but " it 's a very clever device , and one of those " Why did n't I think of that ? " products . " Minica , whose wife calls him a " missing person " during bow season , struggled through at least 10 prototypes  --  " pulling all-nighters at my friend 's machine shop , " he recalls  --  before he perfected the triangular shape , which places the magnets closer together than its circular predecessor did , creating a stronger magnetic field . The design nailed , Minica last year became a semifinalist in the History Channel 's Modern Marvels Invent Now Challenge . Now he 's tweaking an upgrade , which has a slot on the top for quick loading . It took nearly three years to adjust for the magnetic-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind . " Someone a long time ago realized that you could store energy in a curved limb of a tree and launch a projectile , " he says . " Five thousand years later , it 's neat to be a part of its improvement . " BOX HOW IT WORKS Strong magnets in the Air-Rest react with a magnetic insert glued into the arrow body to float the arrow precisely in the center of the rest until released .
