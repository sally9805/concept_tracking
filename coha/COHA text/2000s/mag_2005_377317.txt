Keanu Reeves got a star on the Walk of Fame a couple of weeks ago . The stars are kind of devalued currency these days  --  Reeves ' is No. 2,277  --  but Shia LaBeouf , who plays Reeves ' sidekick in the new movie Constantine , came out to watch the ceremony anyway . He did n't have a lot of company . " There 's about one or two people that he invited , and the rest are Hollywood execs , " LaBeouf says , sounding a little stunned . " His mom was there , and one guy from his band , and then a bunch of fing execs . Francis Lawrence , who directed Constantine and me were just sort of looking at each other . " <P> Here 's what they were thinking : Keanu Reeves is one of the most famous and , since the Matrix movies , one of the richest people in a city where fame and money are the major natural resources . But could he also be one of the loneliest ? <P> You wo n't find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reeves . On set he has a reputation as a workaholic who keeps to himself . Just ask the people who made Constantine . " I 've worked with him for a year and a couple of months , but I do n't really know him that much , " says LaBeouf . " I do n't think he hangs out with other humans that much . " Says Lawrence : " Do I really know Keanu after working with him ? No . I know things about him : he 's hardworking , he 's generous , he 's a sweet , sweet guy . But it 's all just sort of on the surface . " Erwin Stoff , Reeves ' manager and a producer on the movie , has known the actor since he was 13 , and even he 's still guessing . " Keanu is a really private person , " Stoff says . " He 's sort of perfected for himself a way of keeping a distance from people . " <P> Reeves is notoriously inscrutable onscreen as well as off . His face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His voice has a certain forced , hollow depth , like a 12-year-old trying to sound grownup . His talent is hard to pin down , which is one reason a lot of critics think he does n't have any . But they 're wrong . Reeves can handle goofball comedy ( the Bill &; Ted movies ) , high drama ( River 's Edge , My Own Private Idaho ) , cockle warmers ( Hard Ball ) and the occasional romantic comedy ( he really should have wound up with Diane Keaton in Something 's Got ta Give ) . <P> But Reeves really scores in high-concept , high-budget action films , where his signature earnest gravitas and world-weary innocence turn what could be standard-issue , effects-heavy tent poles  --  Speed , the Matrix movies , the underrated Point Break  --  into genuinely compelling entertainment . Something about that mysterious reserve , the total earnestness , the unwinking way he commits to the most absurd scenarios , makes free falls from planes and wire-fighting cyberninjastics feel like a philosophy lesson . Industry scuttlebutt has it that Will Smith was offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you picture the Fresh Prince taking on Agent Smith ? He would have turned The Matrix into Wild Wild West : smirky , expensive and empty . Truly , Reeves is the One .
