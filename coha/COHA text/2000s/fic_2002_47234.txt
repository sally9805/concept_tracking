Steven Utley 's Silurian Tales are time-travel stories that take us to an age that does n't seem as glamorous as , say , the Jurassic period , but there 's still good drama to be had from the age when trilobytes ruled the Earth . ( Ruled ? ! dJ The last one we published was - Cloud by van Gogh " in our December 2000 issue , but others have appeared elsewhere and Mr. Utley says he is working on a full book 's worth of these stories . He hopes to have them finished before the next ice age . Meantime , we have this one to chew on ... <p> THE BOAT TAKING ME upriver broke down the first afternoon out of Stinktown . Doug , the boatman , ran in close to the bank , apologized for what he said would be only a slight delay , and disappeared belowdecks to fuss with his malfunctioning motor or balky galley slaves , whichever . Till now , I 'd kept pretty much to myself , and so had the other passenger . Which suited me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent some time in sickbay - jumping through a spacetime anomaly is about as much fun as riding in a spin dryer full of rocks - and I still felt rotten . I was behind schedule , too , which made me feel rottener . There had been a third passenger when we set out , a bland-looking fellow who got off before we even left the marshes behind . The whole time he 'd been aboard he just sat on a crate and played a recorder , with a beatific look on his face . He played well , coaxing out of that simple instrument of his what I supposed was something by Mozart , or maybe one of the B 's . Given my druthers , he 'd 've stayed and played , and the other passenger would 've gone over the side . As soon as he 'd gone , though , The Other Passenger approached with a sort of ducking and bobbing movement , like a stray dog wanting to make friends . There was no way I could pretend not to notice him , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my earbook and let him introduce himself as Ellis something or something Ellis ( he mumbled ) , tell me his specialty ( something botanical ) , and make a joke appropriate to our situation ( never mind ) . I replied in kind , skipping only the joke . It really was like feeding a stray dog : he brightened appreciably and stopped mumbling . He said , " I found the propelling idea for my own line of research in one of Kelly 's early monographs . " " Whose ? " " Ivan Kelly . He did a lot of pioneering work here on the evolution of soil and the part mid-Paleozoic terrestrial organisms played in the transformation of sterile regolith into real soil . " " Oh , " I said blankly , " him . " " But Kelly also got stranded far inland once and had to eat whatever he could find for a few days . You know , primitive plants and invertebrates . I want to prove that people could live off the land here indefinitely if they had to . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not just the thought of eating slime and bugs . I 'm a surveyor , not an ecologist , but even I know this is a delicate ecosphere . I do n't think people should be making a real effort to find out what there is to eat here . " " There 're already things here eating each other and the plants . " " Take it from a guy who 's seen bulldozers mow down forests and mountains in an afternoon . Human beings always end up taking bigger bites than anything else . " " I know . That 's why , back in our own time , the world is n't any too homelike anymore . People 've made it so . The day will come , though , when a few people here decide not to go back . A few determined , resourceful people could live here . " " I do n't think anybody could survive here very long . There 's no wood for fire or tools . No soil to grow crops in . " " You 'd hardly need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted was to eke out an existence as a huntergatherer . If you were willing to jettison all the trappings of civilization . " He dared to sneer slightly , and when I did n't immediately assault him , he broadened it . " You mean like computers , television , government ? " " I mean books , music , art , and science and technology . " " Maybe the kind of people I have in mind would n't want all those things . Maybe they 'd know better this time . They could make this into a very different Earth . " " This is already a very different Earth . " He 'd come a good way from mumbling in just a few short minutes ; now he spoke with an intensity I had to begun to find creepy . I decided to cut the conversation short and remarked that I really was hopelessly behind in my work and without further adieu stuck in the earbook . It was actually a novel , but he could n't know . He nodded , backed away , retreated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenery . The Paleozoic landscape is a very nearly bare stage , with a thin fuzz of greenery along its edges . It looks as unpromising as a teenager 's first mustache . There 's nothing like it to make you mix your metaphors . But if there had n't been much to look at while the boat was moving , there was even less now that it had stopped . Ellis must have debated with himself for all of five or six minutes before deciding that I was a lesser evil than boredom . When I saw him start to sidle forward again , I pointedly gazed off into the middle distance and looked rapt . He moved by me and went to the bow , as though that was where he 'd been intending to go anyway , and pretended to admire the scenery from that end of the boat . The sun climbed down the sky . Doug emerged from belowdecks , with so much machine gunk on him he resembled an old-time minstrel , and told us , " Guess we 'll be spending the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Stinktown for help ? " " I could , but I 'm a civilian contractor , and I have my reputation to consider . " " Like your boat breaking down in the middle of nowhere wo n't affect your reputation . " He smiled tightly . " I can fix the engine , but it 's gon na take a while longer . " He held up his grimy hands . " Either one of you feel like cooking dinner ? " I looked at Ellis and shrugged and said , " I 'll cook . " You spend any time in the field , you better know how to fix dinner . But I quickly added , " This once . " Ellis shrugged in turn , trying to look casual . " I 'll cook tomorrow . " Doug said , " Okay , good , " and went below again . I went below , too , to the tiny galley . The stores were the usual desiccated stuff , but I flung together this and that and called it an onion souffl6 , and Doug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the doubt once we 'd crammed ourselves into the eating area . He 'd evidently immersed himself in solvent , because he came to dinner looking spotless and smelling faintly , not unpleasantly , of chemicals . When he had cleaned his plate , Ellis said to Doug , " Are we going to be here very long tomorrow ? " " As long as it takes . " " Then I want to look around . There 's an ideal spot at that bend ahead . That bank 's bound to have submerged hollows , perfect hideouts . " " Hideouts for what ? " " Fish . " Doug looked just about as incredulous as I felt . " Be right back , " said Ellis , and bolted from the table . He returned dragging , I swear , fishing tackle , which he unloaded untidily in our midst . " First let me show you my rod . " " Not on your life , " I said , but he went ahead and showed off his rod , and his net , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal baggage allowance for this junk . " " I 'm one of those rare individuals who 's truly able to combine pleasure and research . " " What pleasure ? " " Everyone must have their pastimes . " " I agree . That 's why I brought lots of music and " long , dense nineteenth-century novels . You can listen to music and read practically anywhere . Fishing , though . " " You do n't fish ? " " I was born and raised in a Kansas wheat field . " " So you do n't know the first thing about fishing . " That struck me as serious talk from someone I was becoming more and more convinced did n't know the first thing about anything . " The idea 's to get the fish on the hook , is it not ? " " Ostensibly , " Doug cut in . I looked at him in surprise ; he lifted a shoulder in a half-shrug . " Definitely , if you 're fishing for your supper . I like fishing , too . Or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at peace with everything . " " Everything except the fish , I guess . " " I bear the fish no malice . Unless I was hungry , I always released the ones I caught . I enjoy fishing for the sake of fishing . " " I see . It 's a zen exercise . " We had been ignoring Ellis . " Here and now , " he cut in resentfully , " I 'm going to catch fish for food and study . " He opened a leather case , and its contents lay gleaming in the light from the overhead . " I made all of these lures myself , to experiment with . " He pointed to some nasty  --  looking bare barbs . " Those 're just for raw bait , of course , for fish that hunt by smell or taste . But these - " he indicated several colorful tied flies It - are designed to attract those that hunt by sight . And this - " a bulletlike thing " - is for fish that hunt by sound . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have vibration sensor organs . " He motioned for me to hold out my hand , then picked up the bullet-like thing , gave it a twist , and dropped it into my palm , where it lay humming and tickling insistently . " My ex traded me in for one of these , " I said , " only larger . " Doug had been regarding Ellis 's battery of lures with undisguised skepticism . Now he said , " I hate to be the one to have to tell you , but there is n't a fish on Earth now with the physical or mental equipment to snap at one of your lures . " " I guess we 'll find out if that 's true . " I said , " I 've heard reports - no , maybe they 're only rumors something , anyhow , about freshwater sharks . " " Pseudosharklets , " Doug said , " little things , about as long as your hand . They have jaws , and they eat invertebrates . " " Would n't be much sport in catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doug said , " is in standing hip-deep in muddy water for hours . " " Very relaxing , I 'm sure . " Once again we were ignoring Ellis . " Well , " he announced , " I have a more serious purpose than sport . I am , as the saying goes , after bigger fish . " " Read my lips , " Doug said . " There are no big fish here . If you pull anything bigger than my hand out of this creek or any other body of water here in the Paleozoic , I 'll eat it . " " Good ! " I did n't like the way he said that . Not at all . " I 've been thinking a lot lately , " he went on , " that everybody could use a change from the same old foodstuffs . " Doug looked at him suspicioulsy . " What 's wrong with the same old foodstuffs ? We 've got all my favorites . " Ellis wrinkled his nose . " Dried vegetables , rice , oatmeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number of possible combinations is astronomical , the practical combinations are limited . I 've been experimenting . " Doug shook his head . " Do n't like the sound of that word , experiment . Do n't like it at all . " I nodded agreement . " Not where food 's concerned . " " Hear me out . I volunteer to do lunch if you 'll give me a free hand . " " Hell , no , " Doug said . " What he said , " I said . Ellis was clearly disappointed . " I do n't get it . I bet , ordinarily , back home , you guys 'd eat almost anything . Stale pizza , undermicrowaved frozen food . " " We knew what that stuff was , " said Doug . " You 're as bad as little kids . " " There 's also the matter of nutrition , " I said . " What about vitamins and minerals ? Protein ? " " Well , that 's part of my project , too . I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind ? " Doug asked . " Suitable for use as human food . This is not off-the-wall stuff . It is n't just paleobiological research I 'm interested in . I 've always been fascinated by the history of food . I 've always wondered who figured out things like how to make bread or what you had to do to an olive to make it edible . " " How about who figured out how to turn a cow into a meat bar ? Ellis pretended I had n't spoken . " And fugu ! What about fugu ? Who figured out which part of the blowfish is edible and which part 'll kill you dead ? " " Maybe people in some Japanese fishing village , " Doug said . " Blowfish was all they could catch that week , and they were starving . " " Well , even if they were , you 'd think as soon as the first couple of people keeled over dead - " " Well , maybe it was some Japanese nobleman who just rounded up a bunch of peasants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to see what happens . What 're they gon na do ? The choice 's between maybe being poisoned if they comply or definitely getting their heads lopped off if they do n't . " " Well , be that as it may , " Ellis said , " I propose to see what I can do with the materials available locally . Back at Stinktown , I sampled the fish , shellfish , seaweeds . Here - " " Yuck , " said Doug , " seaweed ! " " It 's the same stuff you find wrapped around sushi - 11 " Yuck , " said Doug , " sushi , " but Ellis kept right on talking . " - or it 's its ancestor , anyway . " " How can you be sure , " I asked , " those things are n't all loaded with defensive toxins ? Or that one of those ugly little fish is n't the Paleozoic equivalent of fugu . You want to poison yourself , do n't let anybody stop you . But do n't be wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've devised a few simple tests to determine the presence of toxins . However , this is not a sophisticated biota , relative to what we know back in our own time . In four hundred million years , land plants will have evolved all sorts of chemical defenses against parasites and things . The little stems we see here , though , they 're just barely plants as it is , They do n't even have roots . They have n't evolved the complex range of chemical defenses their descendants need because there is n't the horde of parasites here . " " Does n't mean that some preadapted sprig could n't put us all in our graves , " Doug said . " It does n't even have to kill us , it might just give us the runs . " " I want to give it a try , all the same . I promise you that I shall never set anything before you that I have n't subjected to rigorous chemical analysis . " Ellis looked from Doug to me and back . " Come on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say yes or no now , sleep on it . " He gathered up his junk , somehow without putting out anyone 's eye , and left us sitting . " Do n't know about you , " Doug said , " but I 'm not inclined to be one of his guinea pigs . " " Think I 'll pass , too . " I put my tongue between my molars for a second . " Still , he 's got a point , has n't he ? The knowledge of what 's edible and what 's not might come in handy . Survival in the wilderness and all that , What if our boat were to break down in the middle of nowhere ? " " Oh , " said Doug , " that 's funny . Ha , ha . " His pocket beeper went off . " That 's for the radio . Must be a weather report . " He worked himself free and rose from the table . Over his shoulder , he let me have it between the eyes with one last Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three of us spread pallets on deck , and Ellis tried to launch us into conversation again , but Doug told him to shut up and go to sleep . Their voices were the only sounds under the black starshot Paleozoic sky ; the exchange was jarring . I tossed and writhed and do n't remember sleeping at all , though at one point I noticed that the moon had suddenly changed position . Then - again , suddenly I heard the engine turning over . I opened my eyes and saw the sun hovering its own diameter above the eastern horizon . The engine stopped . I sat up and looked around . I was alone on deck . Doug was in the galley , brewing coffee and mixing oatmeal and dried fruit . " Engines fixed , " he said as he handed me a cup . " Then we can be on our . merry way . " " Not just yet . " " Christ . What 's the problem now ? " " There 's still something I 've got to take care of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 " Said he was going grocery shopping . " " Uh oh . " " Do me a favor , help me keep an eye on Nature Boy this morning will you ? " I sat down heavily . " He 's really a flake , is n't he ? " " You - we probably do n't know the half of it . " " Did he take all that ridiculous fishing gear with him ? " " Nope . Just a net and a couple of plastic buckets . Anyway , we do n't want him wandering off or getting hurt . " " We do n't ? " " Have some oatmeal . " After breakfast , I went up on deck . At first there was no sign of Ellis , but then I saw him wading well upstream ; every now and then he 'd bend down , reach into the water , and put something into one of the buckets . My first impulse was to yell at him to get out of the goddamn water . Then I thought , So what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe it 's Latin , for " big ugly water bug with an attitude . " No such luck , though . I tired of waiting to see him pulled under and plugged in my earbook and went back to The Way of All Flesh . Thus far , it had gone kind of like an Anthony Trollope novel with bamboo splints shoved under its fingernails - Samuel Butler suffered from no deficiency of bile - but now it had a somehow soothing effect . I found myself enjoying it even more , Ellis having provided me with a face for Butler 's unlovable main character . Doug came on deck after a while and busied himself checking the crates lashed amidships , then went into the wheelhouse , came back out , went below , came back up , went back into his wheelhouse , fiddled with the radio , came back out , etc . I had n't figured him for the anxious type , but you just never know ; if anyone had a right to be antsy , it was me . He kept looking downriver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wristwatch , too . Finally I called to him , " Do n't worry , I 've had my eye on him the whole time , he 's right over yonder , " and pointed to Ellis . Doug glanced in that direction and nodded to me , but he made no attempt to summon Ellis , just went into a new cycle of repetitions , wheelhouse , deck , look around , check the time . The morning wore on . Ellis returned lugging his now-filled buckets and went straight down into the galley . A little before noon , he reemerged and proudly announced that luncheon was served . I took my time getting up , and Doug , whom I could see in the wheelhouse , hesitated as well before bestirring himself . Down in the galley , Ellis set steaming plates before us . " What is it , " I asked , " creamed spinach ? " " of course not . The green stuff 's a water plant . " " I 'm not eating pond scum , " Doug said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ellis looked at me smugly . " Protein , you know . " Doug said , " I 'm not eating this stuff , whatever it is . He pushed the plate away , reached around to grab things out of the food locker , and stuck a slice of meat bar between two crackers . " Come on , " Ellis implored me , " just taste it . Look , " and he conveyed some green slime from his own plate to his mouth . I watched carefully to see that he swallowed . " Quite tasty , really . " " That trick did n't work for my mom , it sure 's hell wo n't work for you . " " Do it for science . " I muttered a curse under my breath and picked up my fork . Doug smirked at me around his mouthful of meat bar sandwich . The green stuff tasted a little like turnip greens ; Ellis had used a lot of vinegar and tossed in dried shallots , too , which I thought was cheating . I resisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have condiments on him that time he 'd got lost in the wilderness . Instead , I gingerly sampled the fish , and after chewing and swallowing , I said , " Tastes like anchovies , only saltier , oilier . Fishier . " " Nonsense , " Ellis said happily . " It 's an estuarine fish- the Paleozoic equivalent of catfish . " Picking at my food , I inexorably reduced the volume on my plate . Ellis ate with unabashed gusto . He had finished two big helpings by the time I was down to my last couple of bites . Doug washed down his repast with a beer and left after favoring me with another smirk ; to Ellis he said only , " Cook cleans up . " Ellis gave me a big smile , revealing a bit of green stuff stuck on an eyetooth . " Finish up , " he said , " there 's dessert ! " I draw a merciful veil of silence over what followed . Afterward , I left him in the galley and went on deck . Doug was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You waiting for a tow ? " I said , but he only shook his head . I tried to take up my novel where I 'd left off . Ellis appeared after a time and approached me , smiling . The bit of green stuff was still stuck to his smile . " Well , " he said , " was Kelly onto something , or was n't he ? " I cut off Samuel Butler in mid-tirade and said , " Yes , Kelly was a genius . And you are truly worthy to take up his mantle . Forgive me for having ever doubted it . " " I just meant - since you obviously were n't completely revolted - " His face had fallen slightly , and in spite of myself I felt I owed him something . " No , I was n't revolted . In fact , I did manage to clean my plate , so I guess compliments are due to the chef . My compliments , chef . A word of friendly advice , though . Do n't go into the catering business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I admit it is n't fun food . The point is , you now know you could survive here if you had to - live off the land . " I thought that was still pretty arguable , but all I said was , " Well , let 's hope I never have to . " " What 's that ? " I became aware , all at once , of a faint drumming sound . it quickly grew louder and resolved itself into the beating of helicopter blades , and I turned to see a Navy machine approaching us - low and fast , purposefully , like a barracuda - from the direction of Stinktown . Ellis saw it at the same moment . He looked stunned . Then he screamed , " Goddammit ! " and leaped over the side of the boat . He flailed through the shallow water and scrambled , muddy and trailing algal filaments , onto the bank . He ran a short distance in one direction , then in another , paused to look up at the helicopter , ran several more yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a foot of the ground , and three bluejackets jumped out and quickly closed on him . Ellis ran in a circle , then stopped suddenly and plopped down on the ground . Even at that distance I could see that he was crying like a baby . The bluejackets scooped him up , not ungently , and half-led , half-dragged him toward the helicopter . Crouching in the door of the helicopter was a young Navy officer and another man , a civilian I vaguely recalled from Stinktown . The bluejackets loaded Ellis into the helicopter , the civilian patted him reassuringly on the arm , then looked our way , smiled , gave us the thumbs-up . I looked around to see Doug acknowledge with a wave , though he was n't returning the smile . The helicopter rose , turned , pointed itself , and flew away , back toward Stinktown . I watched until the machine had dwindled to a dot , then went over to Doug and demanded , " Now what the hell was that all about ? " " Ellis was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . He told me he was going upriver to do field work . I thought he was traveling sort of light , but he 'd done a good job of faking his authorizations . Anyway , they turned the camp inside out looking for him , climbed all over the headlands . They were about to start dragging the marsh when somebody thought to send out an A.P.B . I got it after dinner last night and radioed back I 'd wait here until they came to collect him . " " So he was really going to go off into the wilderness and try to live on slime and bugs . " I spread my hands in a gesture of disbelief . " Is n't screening supposed to keep lunatics out of Paleozoic time ? " " Just the obvious ones . " " How obvious do they have to be ? " He had no answer for that , so I said , " Well , you might at least 've told them to come get him before I had to eat goddamn pond scum for lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as he turned to go into the wheelhouse , " for making fun of my boatmanship . " Far inland , the river separates into its tributaries . Bands of color mark some of the confluences ; the waters rushing down from ancient highlands are relatively clear , those meandering across the peneplain are turbid and brown . And would n't you know it , we ran aground on a sand bar Doug swore had n't been there the trip before . He said he could rock us off , but it would take a little while . Strangely calm , I nodded and glanced up at the sky . It was almost noon . " While you 're rocking , " I said , " why do n't I whip us up some lunch . " He nodded absently . " Good idea . You know where everything is . " " Yep , pretty much . " I went to the galley and tossed all of Doug 's meat bars through a porthole . Then I went looking for Ellis 's net and buckets .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
