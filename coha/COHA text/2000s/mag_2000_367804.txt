Visualize this : Timothy Draper , the gonzo venture capitalist from Silicon Valley , swoops into a South Central Los Angeles church to preach the gospel of school vouchers to a group of black ministers . He is introduced  --  by his own advance man  --  as " an instrument of God 's hand , like Rosa Parks . " Never mind that this is a 42-year-old multimillionaire preppie known to ski in boxer shorts and throw Frisbees at conferences , who even dressed as Batman to inaugurate a Manhattan office . Today , Draper tells the assembled pastors , he is ready to spend at least $20 million of his fortune to " fix education . " Moreover , he adds , " it wo n't cut into my lifestyle one bit . " <P> If Draper lacks the common touch , he makes up for it in chutzpah . " I 'm a freedom fighter , " he says , explaining why he is bankrolling a campaign to pass an initiative that would require the state to offer a $4,000 annual voucher to any parent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . The measure , which will be on California 's November ballot , is likely to spark the most heated and expensive proposition campaign in the U.S. , with vigorous opposition from Governor Gray Davis , the California Teachers Association , PTAs and groups such as the California Business Roundtable . The sideshow could influence the presidential race in the most golden state of all , inciting greater Democratic turnout to fight the measure . Voucher advocates may try to persuade George W. Bush to endorse it  --  and risk alienating moderates . <P> This week Draper , a prominent Bush fund raiser , will launch the campaign for the proposition with a $4,000-a-head cocktail party at his home in a wealthy community outside San Francisco , along with rallies in San Diego , Los Angeles , Fresno and Sacramento . Overseeing the effort are Joe Gaylord , longtime strategist for Newt Gingrich , and Pat Rosenstiel , a former Midwest political director for Steve Forbes . But few if any big names are expected to high-five with Draper at his campaign podiums . So far , such school-choice advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have raised $100 million to send poor children to private schools , are steering clear , as are Bush and other elected officials . <P> Draper 's initiative is different from Florida 's voucher law , signed by Governor Jeb Bush but now under court challenge . The initiative would not target low-income families or subpar schools . " If it were for just one type of person , it would mean more bureaucracy , " he says . Draper 's polls show that an across-the-board voucher has more chance of passage . Indeed , Bishop Charles Blake , of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ , where Draper met with pastors , endorses the measure , which would be a boon to his 230-pupil Christian academy . But the Rev. Cecil Murray of the First African Methodist Church , fears " it would siphon off people of privilege from public schools and subsidize that siphoning . " Families of the more than 600,000 California children already in private school would be eligible for an estimated $2.4 billion a year in vouchers . People like Draper , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George W. , could qualify for all four of his children .
