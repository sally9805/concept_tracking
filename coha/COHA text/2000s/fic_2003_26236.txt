Outside her bedroom window , the blanket of fallen leaves moved - one footstep at a time . Cindy Swyteck lay quietly in her bed , her sleeping husband at her side . It was a dark winter night , cold by Miami standards . In a city where forty degrees was considered frigid , no more than once or twice a year could she light the fireplace and snuggle up to Jack beneath a fluffy down comforter . She slid closer to his body , drawn by his warmth . A gusty north wind rattled the window , the shrill sound alone conveying a chill . The whistle became a howl , but the steady crunching of leaves was still discernible , the unmistakable sound of an approaching stranger . Flashing images in her head offered a clear view of the lawn , the patio , and the huge almond leaves scattered all about . She could see the path he 'd cut through the leaves . It led straight to her window . Five years had passed since she 'd last laid eyes on her attacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he was dead , though she knew he 'd never really be gone . On nights like these , she could have sworn he was back , in the flesh . His name was Esteban . Five years , and the horrifying details were still burned into her memory . His calloused hands and jagged nails so rough against her skin.The stale puffs of rum that came with each nauseating breath in her face . The cold , steel blade pressing at her jugular . Even then , she 'd refused to kiss him back . Most unforgettable of all were those empty , sharklike eyes - eyes so cold and angry that when he 'd opened his disgusting mouth and bit her on the lips she saw her own reflection , witnessed her own terror , in the shiny black irises . Five years , and those haunting eyes still followed her everywhere , watching her every move . Not even her counselors seemed to understand what she was going through . It was as if the eyes of Esteban had become her second line of sight . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mind of her attacker and see things he 'd seen before his own violent death . Stranger still , she seemed to have a window to the things he might be seeing now . Through his eyes , she could even watch herself . Night after night , she had the perfect view of Cindy Swyteck lying in bed , struggling in vain with her incurable fear of the dark . Outside , the scuffling noise stopped . The wind and leaves were momentarily silent . The digital alarm clock on the nightstand blinked on and off , the way it always did when storms interrupted power . It was stuck on midnight , bathing her pillow with faint pulses of green light . She heard a knock at the back door . On impulse , she rose and sat at the edge of the bed . Do n't go , she told herself , but it was as if she were being summoned . Another knock followed , exactly like the first one . On the other side of the king-sized bed , Jack was sleeping soundly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . Cindy saw herself rise from the mattress and plant her bare feet on the tile floor . Each step felt colder as she continued down the hall and through the kitchen . The house was completely dark , and she relied more on instinct than sight to maneuver her way to the back door . She was sure she 'd turned off the outside lights at bedtime , but the yellow porch light was burning . Something had obviously triggered the electronic eye of the motion detector . She inched closer to the door , peered out the little diamond-shaped window , and let her eyes roam from one edge of the backyard to the other . A gust of wind ripped through the big almond tree , tearing the brownest leaves from the branches . They fell to the ground like giant snowflakes , but a few were caught in an upward draft and rose into the night , just beyond the faint glow of the porch light . Cindy lost sight of them , except for one that seemed to hover above the patio . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly changed direction , came straight toward her , and slammed against the door . The noise startled her , but she did n't back away . She kept looking out the window , as if searching for whatever it was that had sent that lone leaf streaking toward her with so much force . She saw nothing , but in her heart she knew that she was mistaken . Something was definitely outthere . She just could n't see it . Or maybe it was Esteban who could n't see it . Stop using his eyes ! The door swung open . A burst of cold air hit her like an Arctic front . Goose bumps covered her arms and legs . Her silk nightgown shifted in the breeze , rising to midthigh . She somehow knew that she was colder than ever before in her life , though she did n't really feel it . She did n't feel anything . A numbness had washed over her , and though her mind told her to run , her feet would n't move . It was suddenly impossible to gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments was she strangely at ease with the silhouette in the doorway . " Daddy ? " " Hi , sweetheart . " " What are you doing here ? " " It 's Tuesday . " " So ? " " Is Jack here ? " " He 's sleeping . " " Wake him . " " For what ? " " It 's our night to play poker . " " Jack ca n't play cards with you tonight . " " We play every Tuesday . " " I 'm sorry , Daddy . Jack ca n't play with you anymore . " " Why not ? " " Because you 're dead . " With a shrill scream she sat bolt upright in bed . Confused and frightened , she was shivering uncontrollably . A hand caressed her cheek , and she screamed again . " It 's okay , " said Jack . He moved closer and tried putting his arms around her . She pushed him away . " No ! " " It 's okay , it 's me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch her breath . A lone tear ran down her face . She wiped it away with the back of her hand . It felt as cold as ice water . " Take a deep breath , " said Jack . " Slowly , in and out . " She inhaled , then exhaled , repeating the exercise several times . In a minute or so , the panic subsided and her breathing became less erratic . Jack 's touch felt soothing now , and she nestled into his embrace . He sat up beside her and wrapped his arms around her . " Was it that dream again ? " She nodded . ( Continues ... )
