How an architecture-loving couple in L.A. set out to restore pedigreed properties that once belonged to Charlie Chaplin and Cecil B. De Mille . Photograph Photograph DE MILLE HOUSE For Lisa Lyons and Richard Grossman ( left ) , the De Mille house is their latest project and magnum opus . Their architect Brian Tichenor , of Tichenor &; Thorp , fondly dubs the circa-1914 mansion a " midwestern Italianate Revival , " because its downstairs public spaces ( original living room , above ; staircase under renovation , top right ) far outstrip the private upstairs rooms in grandeur . De Mille himself ( top left ) had a great appreciation for the august facade . Photograph DE MILLE HOUSE Photographs then and now reveal the faithful restoration work under way . A 1947 image ( above ) shows Cecil B. De Mille and his granddaughter Citzie in the atrium ; the breezeway at rear led to the Chaplin house next door .

The iron balcony railings have been removed for restoration . // THIS IS NOT , STRICTLY SPEAKING , a Hollywood story , but like most narratives set in this part of the world , it has its share of big-screen touches . It begins with our principals meeting cute ( as we say in film treatments ) . He was an art consultant and writer , she an art consultant and curator . Both were based in Minneapolis , although it was in New York that they were set up by a mutual friend-on the corner of Spring Street and West Broadway , to be specific . What their friend did n't know was that they had more in common than art and the Land ofTen Thousand Lakes . Architecture , for starters . Lisa Lyons calls it a " disease . " Richard Grossman describes his affliction in terms of the houses he inhabited before he met Lisa : a " two- to three-hundred-year-old " adobe outside Santa Fe , a turn-of-the-century Victorian in Minneapolis , a Tudor Revival " with walk-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he occupied an early Prairie School house in Minneapolis , a handsome compound of brick and stone that the couple happily settled into after they married in 1987 . " It was built by Kees and Colburn and influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright , " Lisa recalls fondly . " The rooms were beautifully proportioned . " When Richard acquired the residence , some rooms were also tricked out in French provincial wallpaper and orange shag . " We peeled off layers of bad stuff and brought the house back to its best self , " he says . " I always get drunk on the spaces of houses , on that kind of pure architectural form . So if I 'm in one house that 's really great , but then I see another place . . . . " But we 're getting ahead of our story Suffice it to say , the process of renovation has become a necessary preoccupation for the house-besotted couple , who have gone on to remake five residences together . In 1989 , Lisa was offered a job as director of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Richard relinquished the Prairie School house to resettle in California.While renting near the beach , they started looking around for their own place . If " looking around " is the term.They took fourteen months and went through some three hundred houses before chancing on the Castillo del Lago . The castle , as it 's known , is a Spanish Colonial Revival palace built in the 1920s , whose plumb lines and octagonal tower would look comfortable in 18th-century Bogota but happen to grace a scrubby knoll above Lake Hollywood . " As a piece of architecture , it was a work of genius , " says Lisa ( now a consultant in contemporary art to the J. Paul Getty Trust ) , running a hand through her two-inch buzz cut . " Very severe but very romantic . " She is perpendicular on a canary yellow sofa in the modern family room of the couple 's current residence , four moves after the castle . Richard is perched on the other sofa with Floyd , the couple 's three-year-old Australian terrier . Attired in matching nubby brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandarin air . ( About a year after they acquired the castle , Richard began work on a trilogy of novels modeled after Dante 's Divine Comedy ; he is now completing the third installment . ) When Richard was n't writing and Lisa was n't visiting artists ' studios , they made their own contributions to the castle , rewiring , chasing leaks and generally looking after the place . Until 1993 , that is , when a classic Spanish Revival down the hill came on the market . The house was designed in 1927 by Roland Coate , a California architect known for his graceful revival treatments . " It had a wonderful U-shaped courtyard , " remembers Richard , " with a colonnade and sunken fountain . " " And a pool that the pool man loved , " Lisa adds . They made arrangements to sell the castle , which was promptly snapped up by a performer named Madonna . ( This is a Los Angeles story , remember . ) Madonna 's embellishments to the property would include red and ocher stripes around the octagonal tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa can only describe as " very sad for us . " Photograph CHAPLIN HOUSE Grossman and Lyons have restored the northern Spanish Revival villa Charlie Chaplin owned from 1918 to 1919 ; the next year De Mille acquired it . The loggia was lovely then ( above , in a 1921 film still ) and remains so now ( above left ) ; the living room ( left ) was used by De Mille as a screening room and office . // They had the distraction of their new residence , which bore its own scars . " An interior decorator had turned it into a French-Italian fantasy , " says Lisa . " He 'd brought in a muralist who painted the floors , ceilings , every surface in the house . It looked like- " " Like Brice Marden on psilocybin , " suggests Richard . " It was like a setting for an MTV video . Or a Victoria 's Secret catalogue-those lingerie colors , " Lisa offers . They interviewed a number of architects for the rescue effort , but only two came recommended by several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm grounding in both landscape design and restoration , having set to rights everything from the eccentric Capitol Records Building in Hollywood to Paul Williams 's historicist houses . " They clearly knew the architecture and loved it , " says Lisa . " And since the house had a very good lot , the notion that they also understood landscape was perfect . Brian Tichenor has an amazing depth of knowledge of historical architecture . He 's also an absolutely beautiful draftsman . " Tichenor 's wife and partner , Raun Thorp , supervised the interior architecture and detailing , down to the selection of lighting and hardware . Tichenor and Thorp spent some three years applying chemical peels to the lingerie-colored surfaces , mending a remodeled wing and repairing the courtyard . Lisa and Richard , who lived in the house during the rescue effort , insist that the payoff outweighed the privation . And yet , and yet . . .
