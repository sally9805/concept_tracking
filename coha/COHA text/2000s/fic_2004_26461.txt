Chapter One Ship 's Eyes Sailing toward dawn , and I was perched atop the crow 's nest , being the ship 's eyes . We were two nights out of Sydney , and there 'd been no weather to speak of so far . I was keeping watch on a dark stack of nimbus clouds off to the northwest , but we were leaving it far behind , and it looked to be smooth going all the way back to Lionsgate City . Like riding a cloud . The sky pulsed with stars . Some people say it makes them lonesome when they stare up at the night sky . I ca n't imagine why . There 's no shortage of company . By now there 's not a constellation I ca n't name . Orion . Lupus . Serpens . Hercules . Draco . My father taught me all their stories . So when I look up I see a galaxy of adventures and heroes and villains , all jostling together and trying to outdo one another , and I sometimes want to tell them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've glimpsed all the stars ever discovered by astronomers , and plenty that have n't been . There 're the planets to look at too , depending on the time of year . Venus . Mercury . Mars . And do n't forget Old Man Moon . I know every crease and pockmark on that face of his . My watch was almost at an end , and I was looking forward to climbing into my bunk , sliding under warm blankets and into a deep sleep . Even though it was only September and we were crossing the equator , it was still cool at night up in the crow 's nest , parting the winds at seventy-five miles anhour . I was grateful for my fleece-lined coat . Spyglass to my face , I slowly swept the heavens . Here at the Aurora 's summit , shielded by a glass observation dome , I had a three-sixty view of the sky around and above the ship . The lookout 's job was to watch for weather changes and for other ships . Over the Pacificus , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant flicker of a freighter , ploughing the waves toward the Orient . But boats were no concern of ours . We sailed eight hundred feet above them . The smell of fresh-baked bread wafted up to me . Far below , in the ship 's kitchens , they were taking out the first loaves and rolls and cinnamon buns and croissants and Danishes . I inhaled deeply . A better smell than this I could n't imagine , and my stomach gave a hungry twist . In a few minutes , Mr. Riddihoff would be climbing the ladder to take the watch , and I could swing past the kitchen and see if the ship 's baker was willing to part with a bun or two . He almost always was . A shooting star slit the sky . That made one hundred and six I 'd seen this season ; I 'd been keeping track . Baz and I had a little contest going , and I was in the lead by twelve stars . Then I saw it . Or did n't see it . Because at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been . I raised my spyglass again and , with the help of the moon , caught a glimpse . It was a hot air balloon , hanging there in the night sky . Its running lights were n't on , which was odd . The balloon was higher than us by about a hundred feet , drifting off our starboard bow . The burner came on suddenly , jetting blue flame to heat the air in the balloon 's envelope for a few seconds . But I could n't see anyone at the controls . They must have been set on a clockwork timer . Nobody was moving around in the gondola . It was deep and wide , big enough for a kind of sleeping cabin on one side , and plenty of storage underneath . I could n't ever recall seeing a balloon this far out . I lifted the speaking tube to my mouth . " Crow 's nest reporting . " I waited a moment as my voice hurtled down through the tube , one hundred fifty feet to the control car suspended from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was Captain Walken on watch tonight , and I was glad , for I much preferred him to the other officers . Some of them just called me " Cruse " or " boy , " figuring I was n't worth a " mister " on account of my age . But never the captain . To him I was always Mr. Cruse , and it got so that I 'd almost started to think of myself as a mister . Whenever I was back in Lionsgate City on shore leave and my mother or sisters called me Matt , my own name sounded strange to me at first . " Hot air balloon at one o'clock , maybe a half mile off , one hundred feet up . " " Thank you , Mr. Cruse . " There was a pause , and I knew the captain would be looking out the enormous wraparound windows of the control car . Because it was set well back from the bow , its view of anything high overhead was limited . That 's why there was always a watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a set of eyes up top . " Yes , I see it now . Well spotted , Mr. Cruse . Can you make out its markings ? We 'll train the light on it . " Mounted at the front of the control car was a powerful spotlight . Its beam cut a blazing swath through the night and struck the balloon . It was in a sorry state , withered and puckered . It was leaking , or maybe the burner was n't working properly . " The Endurance , " I read into the speaking tube . She looked like she 'd endured a bit too much . Maybe a storm had punctured her envelope or bashed her about some . And still no sign of the pilot in the gondola . Along the length of the speaking tube I heard tinny murmurings from the control car as the captain conferred with the bridge officers . " It 's not on the flight plan , " I heard Mr. Torbay , the navigator , say . ( Continues ... )        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
