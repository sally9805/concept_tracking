From Official Review <p> A Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) report issued this past September generated concern about marketing violent entertainment to children ( see " Dateline Washington " CR , October 2000 ) . The report also helped focus attention on the information parents have at hand to monitor what is purchased for their kids . The following , excerpted from the FTC report , surveys the three relevant parental rating systems to provide some helpful perspective on the workings and shortcomings of these systems .  --  Ed . <p> <p> The Motion Picture Industry Self-Regulation System : The motion picture rating system , which was established in 1968 as a joint venture between the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) and the National Association of Theatre Owners ( NATO ) , was crafted following a pair of U.S. Supreme Court decisions upholding the power of states to regulate children 's access to materials protected by the First Amendment . To curtail a proliferation of local censorship boards , the major film studios and theaters created a single , nationwide rating system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have agreed not to distribute a film without a rating . As a result , the vast majority of films are rated . A high percentage of parents are familiar with motion picture ratings ( surveys show more than 90% awareness ) and a large majority ( more than 70% ) find the ratings useful . <p> The Rating Process . The motion picture industry has put in place a formalized rating system ( including an appeals process ) that is designed to impose a measure of objectivity and consistency across the broad array of subjects and styles encompassed by modern filmmaking . Although this system been criticized over the years , it has remained intact for more than 30 years and is well established with the American public . <p> The current categories for film ratings , as defined by the MPAA and NATO , follow : <p> G : General Audiences  --  All ages admitted . Signifies that the film contains nothing most parents will consider offensive for even their youngest children to see or hear . Nudity , sex scenes , and scenes of drug use are absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond polite conversation but do not go beyond common everyday expressions . Recent examples : Chicken Run ; Fantasia 2000 . <p> PG : Parental Guidance Suggested  --  Some material may not be suitable for children . Signifies that the film may contain some material parents might not like to expose to their young children  --  material that will clearly need to be examined or inquired about before children are allowed to attend the film . Explicit sex scenes and scenes of drug use are absent ; nudity , if present , is seen only briefly , horror and violence do not exceed moderate levels . Recent examples : The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle ; The Kid . <p> PG-13 : Parents Strongly Cautioned  --  Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13 . Signifies that the film may be inappropriate for pre-teens . Parents should be especially careful about letting their younger children attend . Rough or persistent violence is absent ; sexually-oriented nudity is generally absent ; some scenes of drug use may be seen ; some use of one of the harsher sexually-derived words may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfect Storm ; Big Momma ' s House . <p> R : Restricted  --  Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian ( age varies in some jurisdictions ) . Signifies that the rating board has concluded that the film may contain some adult material . Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking their children to see it . An R may be assigned due to , among other things , a film 's use of language , theme , violence , sex or its portrayal of drug use . Recent examples : Gladiator ; Shaft ; The Patriot ; Me , Myself and Irene . <p> NC-17 : No One 17 and Under Admitted . Signifies that the rating board believes that most American parents would feel that the film is patently adult and that children age 17 and under should not be admitted to it . The film may contain explicit sex scenes , an accumulation of sexually oriented language , and/or scenes of excessive violence . The NC-17 designation does not , however , signify that the rated film is obscene or pornographic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : None . <p> Each film assigned a rating other than G also receives a brief explanation for the film 's rating , e.g. , " Rated R for terror , violence and language , " or " Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi violence , some sexuality and brief nudity . " <p> The Classification and Ratings Administration ( CARA ) determines the ratings and explanations . Qualifications for membership in CARA are parenting experience and no connection to the film industry . Currently , CARA has 12 members ( known as raters ) , and two Co-Chairs , all of whom are approved by , and serve at the discretion of , the President of the MPAA . <p> Review of Advertising for Content and Rating Information . The motion picture industry 's sell regulatory system is the only one of the three examined by the Commission that includes substantive review and pre-approval of advertising . For a film to use the MPAA-trademarked rating , all advertising materials for a film , including all television and radio commercials , print advertising , Web sites , and trailers ( previews shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Advertising Administration . The Advertising Administration does not approve advertising for products related to motion pictures , such as action figures , toys , clothing , or other licensed products . <p> Review by the Advertising Administration is designed to accomplish two goals . The first is to ensure the accurate dissemination of the rating symbol in all advertising for a film . MPAA rules require that a film 's letter rating be displayed in all advertising . The Commission 's review suggests that the Advertising Administration generally achieves this goal . <p> The Advertising Administration 's other goal is to ensure that the content of a film 's advertising , regardless of the film 's rating , is appropriate for even the youngest audience . <p> The Commission 's review indicates that the Advertising Administration is less successful at meeting its second goal . Theatrical trailers illustrate the point . The Advertising Administration approves two types of trailers , which , based on the Commission 's review of studio media plans , appear to be the first widely disseminated advertisements for a film . The first type , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general audiences and can be shown before any feature film . According to the MPAA , " There will be , in ' all audiences ' trailers , no scenes that caused the feature to be rated PG , PG-13 , R , or NC-17 . " The second type of trailer is for restricted audiences and can be shown only before films rated R or NC-17 . <p> A review of materials submitted to the Commission suggests that , although the Advertising Administration restricts the material allowed in all audience trailers , it ; does not require the studios to remove everything that would cause a movie to be given a rating more restrictive than G. Trailers are approved by the Advertising Administration and shown in theaters long before a film is rated ; consequently , for these " teaser trailers , " the Advertising Administration has no way to know what will cause the raters to rate a film PG or higher . And CARA raters do not evaluate trailers or other advertising . <p> The Commission found numerous examples when trailers approved for " all audiences " contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engender criticism by parents . " For example , the " all audience " trailer for I Know What You Did Last Summer contained verbal references to mutilations ( references to decapitation and to a person being " gutted with a hook " ) and drug use . A trailer for Scream 2 contained a verbal reference to mutilation ( that a woman had been stabbed seven times ) and several visual depictions of violence against women ( women being pursued by a masked , knife-wielding killer ) . <p> Television advertising also is affected when material causing a rating more restrictive than G is not edited out of an " all audience " trailer . Television commercials for movies generally are shortened versions of the trailers ; they thus may contain some of the same violent material . <p> The Music Recording Industry Parental Advisory Labeling Program . The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) created a parental advisory program in 1985 in response to concerns of parent groups about children 's exposure to music with mature themes . Under the program , music recordings that contain explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sex , or drug use , are identified with parental advisory label . <p> The RIAA describes the parental advisory label as a tool for record companies to use to alert parents to explicit lyrics . The decision to label a recording is made by individual record companies and their artists . RIAA members , as well as nonmember companies , use the advisory . <p> The Labeling Process . Unlike the film and electronic game self-regulatory systems , the recording industry labeling program does not have a rating board to determine which music recordings should display the parental advisory label . Nor does the RIAA provide standardized procedures or other guidance as to when a recording should display a parental advisory . Instead , the decision is made by each company for its own products . According to the RIAA , with about 60,000 recordings released each year , the artists and recording companies themselves can make the labeling decision most efficiently . In addition , the RIAA believes that because the parental advisory label is meant to flag for parents any potentially offensive material , it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company to make the labeling decision . Therefore , to report on the labeling process , the Commission reviewed the practices of the five major recording companies . <p> According to the recording companies , the decision to label is subjective , and often made on a case-by-case basis . None of the companies has adopted written policies or guidelines defining " explicit " content in music and none memorializes why a particular recording received the advisory . <p> One company reported that its employees , often in partnership with the artists involved , make " good faith judgments about what kinds of lyrics and depictions parents might find offensive , because of racial epithets , vulgarities , curse words , sexual references , violence , and drug descriptions . " Another company evaluates the content of every recording on the basis of various factors , including , but not limited to : explicit exhortations of sex , violence , illicit drug use , or suicide ; exhortations of violence against any specific named real person or peace officer ; offensive language generally and use of objectionable words ; overall impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial/minority stereotyping . " The ultimate judgment call of whether the content of a recording warrants the parental advisory label is made in light of the message and identity of the artist , the current social climate , and , perhaps most importantly , straightforward common sense , " the company said . <p> Documents from the three remaining companies suggest that they evaluate the content of a recording based on a cursory review of the lyrics . According to these companies , they may decide to label a recording as soon as they hear a number of expletives in one song , without listening to an album 's entire content . One company explained that because the RIAA system involves a single label , a more thorough analysis is unnecessary , and that " the process is not distinctly tailored to differentiate among " violent content , sex , language , or any other reason as the basis for stickering . " <p> If a company and/or an artist determines that a recording contains explicit content , the RIAA recommends using the label on the packaging of all cassettes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the RIAA , the label should measure 1 ' x 5/8 " and should be part of the permanent packaging under the cellophane shrink wrap , rather than a peel-off sticker . <p> ' Clean ' Versions . Although not specifically recommended by the RIAA , the recording companies routinely create and sell edited or " clean " versions of the explicit-content labeled recordings . According to one recording company , an edited version " provides listeners with the option of purchasing an artist 's work without the explicit content as identified by the recording company and ... provides an alternative to retailers and other media outlets that opt not to sell , disseminate or promote the unedited versions of the stickered recordings . " Explicit or unedited versions of recordings usually outsell the edited version , often by over 10 times . <p> In creating an edited version , one company states that it often works closely with the artists to determine the necessary changes . In some recordings any explicit content is simply taken out , while in other instances new lyrics or sounds are added to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a case-by-case basis with the focus centered on the deletion of any explicit content while making minimal changes to the artistic expression . <p> Although the lyrics on the two versions may vary , the CD packaging often does not , except that the explicit version bears the parental advisory label . When the CD packaging itself contains " explicit content , " the artwork used for the explicit and edited versions may differ . Similarly , when the packaging for both versions lists the songs , the edited versions often replace any profanity in song titles with asterisks . <p> Access to important information about explicit recordings . The parental advisory label covers a wide range of content , including violence , sex , and/or drug use , without regard to the fact that some parents may be more concerned with certain types of explicit content than with others . Although the RIAA agrees that parents need information about recordings to be able to make intelligent listening choices for their children , groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Parent Teacher Association have expressed concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide enough information to parents . <p> Unlike the motion picture and electronic game rating systems , the label does not provide reasons for the advisory label or " content descriptors " indicating the nature or the amount of the explicit content ( e.g. , strong language or graphic references to violence , sex , or drug use ) . Instead , one advisory covers a broad spectrum of content , including violence and/or sex . <p> Nor does the label specify the age groups for which an explicit-content-labeled recording may be inappropriate ; parents of a 7-year-old are given the same advisory as parents of a 12- year-old or a 16-year-old . Further , the industry does not provide a means for parents to obtain the lyrics of explicit-content labeled recordings . In fact , the Commission found that , out of the 55 labeled CDs it reviewed , only eight included lyrics for the songs in the packaging . Parental review of a recording may be hindered because the lyrics on many explicit songs are difficult to understand without repeated listening . <p> Recent Changes to the Music Recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended revisions to the parental advisory label program , to be effective October 1 , 2000 . According to the recommendation , the RIAA now asks that industry members : 1 ) use general guidelines , included in the RIAA memorandum , to determine whether a recording warrants a parental advisory label ; 2 ) adopt a policy that the parental advisory label or other prominent notice of explicit content should appear in print advertising for explicit-labeled recordings and that advertising for explicit-content-labeled recordings should not appear in publications , Web sites , or other commercial outlets whose primary ( i.e. , 50% or more ) market demographic is 16 years of age or younger ; and 3 ) adopt a policy that the parental advisory label should appear prominently in on-line retail sites in all stages of the transaction and that on-line retail sites should link to the entertainment industry 's Web site , www.parentalguide.org , where more information on the rating and labeling systems may be found . Further , the RIAA committed to conducting an annual review of its policies and their implementation . These are constructive changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whether and how they will be implemented is not yet known . <p> The Electronic-Game Industry 's System . Beginning in the early 1990 's , Congress responded to concern about the violent content in some electronic games with hearings and legislative proposals . Although no legislation was enacted , several members of Congress were critical of the electronic-game industry for its lack of a self-regulatory system to rate electronic games . In 1994 , industry members formed the Interactive Digital Software Association ( IDSA ) to address this criticism . The IDSA , in turn , created and funded a separate division , the Entertainment Software Rating : Board ( ESRB ) , to develop an interactive software rating system to assist parents in their efforts to select appropriate games for their children . <p> The IDSA/ESRB system rates game software published for all gaming platforms , including cartridge-based and CD-based console systems ( such as the Nintendo 64 , the Sega Dreamcast , and the Sony Playstation , which hook up to a television set ) and personal computer-based systems ( such as a Windows-based PC or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found on all console-based video games and on nearly all personal computer software games . <p> The electronic-game industry 's self-regulatory system is the most comprehensive of the three industry systems studied by the Commission . It is widely used by industry members and has been revised repeatedly to address new challenges , developments , and concerns regarding the practices of its members . Its requirements are set out in the IDSA 's Advertising Code of Conduct ( " Adcode " ) , first adopted in 1995 , and in the ESRB 's Principles and Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices ( " Ad Principles " ) , which became effective in January 2000 . <p> The Rating Process . According to the ESRB , each electronic game title is rated by three people who have no ties to industry and whose identities remain anonymous to industry members . The rating panel for any given game title is selected from a pool of more than 200 individuals with different demographic characteristics ; members of the pool vary by gender , ethnicity , age , and marital and parental status . Each three-member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game publisher or developer , typically videotaped footage of the most extreme portions of the game . During this review , each rater records every instance in which he or she observes a segment of gameplay that qualifies under a particular content rating category . When at least two of the three raters apply the same rating category to the same segment of the game , that rating category becomes the consensus rating for the game . <p> The IDSA/ESRB system rates game titles according to five age-based categories : ( 1 ) Early Childhood , or " EC " ; ( 2 ) Everyone , or " E " ; ( 3 ) Teen , or " T " ; ( 4 ) Mature , or " M " ; and ( 5 ) Adults Only , or " AO . " By definition , game titles rated M contain content suitable only for persons ages 17 and older , and T-rated titles contain content suitable only for persons ages 13 and older . There is also a Rating Pending category ( " RP " ) to indicate that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , the ESRB . According to the ESRB , nearly 75% of games have been rated either EC or E , while 19% have a T rating , 7% have an M rating , and less than 1% have an AO rating . <p> As in the motion picture rating system , a descriptive phrase may be assigned to the letter rating to indicate content that might be of concern to parents , such as language , sexual themes , or violence . Descriptors reflecting violent content include " Mild Animated Violence , " " Mild Realistic Violence , " " Comic Mischief , " " Animated Violence , " " Realistic Violence , " " Animated Blood and Gore , " " Realistic Blood and Gore , " " Animated Blood , " and " Realistic Blood . " <p> The clear majority of games , such as sports and racing games or strategy and puzzle games , do not contain graphic violence or depict blood and gore . Yet hundreds of games do , and , due to technological advances , it is now possible for the maiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast array of weaponry and illustrated in graphic , near lifelike detail . The descriptors , however , do not indicate the intensity of violence in a game . All the violence descriptors but two  --  " Animated Blood and Gore " and " Realistic Blood and Gore "  --  may appear in E-rated games . Games rated T , M , or AO may be assigned any of the violence descriptors . Although the M-rating may suggest a greater level of violence compared to T- and E-rated games , the particular game may have received the M-rating for content other than violence ( e.g. , strong sexual content ) . Thus , although the descriptors , when combined with the ratings , do provide parents with information that is helpful in making decisions as to what is appropriate for their children , the degree of violence may not always be apparent . <p> Disclosure of rating information on product packaging and in advertising . Unlike the film and music industries , the electronic-game industry requires the display of rating icons and , in most cases , content descriptors ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on packaging , in print ads , and on-line . It also requires television ads to include a voice-over stating the game 's rating . <p> The game rating system appears to be helpful to those parents who actually use it . The Commission 's study found that five in six of those parents who use the video-game-rating system at least some of the time when their children want to play a game were " very satisfied " or " somewhat satisfied " with the rating system . Similarly , the Kaiser Survey reported that about 86% of parents who had used the rating system found it to be " very useful " or " somewhat useful . " Eighty percent of respondents in the ESRB survey who had the components of the IDSA/ESRB system described to them found the system " very helpful " or " somewhat helpful . " <p> As to violence , the Commission 's survey found that a majority of parents who are at least slightly familiar with the system believe that the rating system does either an excellent ( 4% ) or good ( 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in video games . In contrast , a Gallup poll conducted in June 1999 reported that 74% of respondents felt that the electronic-game industry did not provide parents with enough information about violent content to make decisions about what is appropriate for children , while 20% believed that the information was sufficient ; . However , respondents in that poll apparently were not screened for experience with the system . <p> Adapted from Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children : A Review of Self-Regulation and Industry Practices in the Motion Picture , Music Recording &; Electronic Game Industries , Report of the Federal Trade Commission , September 2000 . <p>
