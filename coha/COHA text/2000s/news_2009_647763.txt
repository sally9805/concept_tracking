An unprecedented $100 billion in federal stimulus money is starting to flow to school districts . Educators welcome the aid , but with most districts just starting to get estimates of how much they 'll receive , it 's adding complexity to an already confusing budget cycle . <p> Particularly challenging - and emotional - are decisions about how many teachers jobs to fund for next year . <p> Deadlines have been coming up for renewing contracts , yet many state and local education budgets are in flux . That 's putting tens of thousands of teachers into layoff limbo . <p> In some cases , jobs have already been saved . But pink slips are also going out , even as district leaders hope a good number of those jobs can be salvaged in time for the new school year . <p> A look at several states and school districts sheds light on the tension between multiple goals for the stimulus money - saving jobs , reforming education , and avoiding becoming too dependent on a funding stream due to dry up in two years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that for education ... so people have had a hard time figuring out what to do , " says Bruce Hunter , an associate executive director of the American Association of School Administrators ( AASA ) in Arlington , Va . <p> In some states , such as California , the stimulus money wo n't be enough to offset budget shortfalls . " The problem now is the state revenue estimates keep dropping , " Mr. Hunter says . " It has made it nearly impossible to plan ... so people have handed out a lot of layoff notices . " <p> An AASA survey found that 44 percent of school districts planned to lay off staff for 2009-10 . The survey was taken in March - after the stimulus legislation had passed , but before school districts could know details . <p> Absent the stimulus , the number of K-12 jobs lost by 2011 would probably total about 574,000 - 9 percent of the field , according to a February analysis by University of Washington professor Marguerite Roza . <p> It will be a while before anyone knows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , it has already spared some teachers . The school board voted last week to rescind nearly 2,000 layoff notices that had gone out to elementary school teachers in March . <p> But more than 5,000 other teaching , administrative , and support positions are still slated for elimination . <p> One of those jobs is Julie Van Winkle 's . She 's a math and science teacher at the John H. Liechty Middle School , and with five years of experience , she 's a mentor to other teachers . But because she taught at a charter school for several years , her seniority clock started over when she returned to the district this year . <p> " It 's frustrating because ... there are n't a lot of teachers whose first choice is to teach middle school ... particularly in this community , " where most of the students come from low-income families , Ms. Van Winkle says . <p> Because so many teachers at her school are relatively new , about 70 percent received termination notices from the district . " It could really change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Her union , United Teachers Los Angeles , has urged the district to make other cuts and use more of the stimulus money right away to save teachers jobs . " The district is playing with people 's lives , " says president A.J. Duffy . " If they continue what they say they are doing , which is finding the fat , they could find the extra money , " he says . The group is planning demonstrations in the coming weeks . <p> With a projected shortfall of $1.4 billion over the next two years , largely because of state cuts , the L.A. schools can not avoid increasing class sizes and cutting some teachers , district leaders say . Without the stimulus , " it would have been twice as bad , " says school board president Monica Garcia . More than 1,000 jobs are being cut from the administrative side , she notes . <p> The board plans to seek additional stimulus dollars that the US Department of Education will be handing out on a competitive basis to districts that pursue key reforms . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we heard Washington say loud and clear ... ' We 're going to be holding you accountable for results , " Ms. Garcia says . <p> For states to obtain one part of the stimulus designated primarily for education ( called stabilization funds ) , they must submit an application to the US Department of Education explaining how the money will be used . California , South Dakota , and Illinois are the first states to have their applications approved . Almost $4 billion - $2.6 billion of it for K-12 - was released to California last weekend , for instance , and it can apply for another $2 billion this fall . <p> Three other states - Maine , Utah , and Mississippi - have sent in applications , and many more are expected to soon . The department has pledged to respond to applications within two weeks . <p> Van Winkle says she understands that budget cuts are necessary , but she thinks they 're falling too heavily on teachers . In her school , students stay with the same teacher in sixth and seventh grades , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep connection with , " she says . She and many of her colleagues are hopeful that putting up a fight might save their jobs , " but it would be naive to count on that , " she says . " We should start looking , but we 're so attached to our school and our students that we 're kind of in denial . " <p> In Arizona , educators are waiting to see how deep state cuts will be . The Gilbert Public School district looked at a " worst-case scenario " and sent layoff notices to 267 teachers and more than 100 other staff by an April 15 deadline , says board president Thad Stump . Under this scenario , the district will need to cut $27 million for next year , a little more than 10 percent of its current budget . <p> Officials there hope to find savings in other areas and recall a substantial number of those teachers once the budget is finalized . But it could be late June before budget numbers come in from the state . <p> Hundreds of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including teachers , students , and parents pleading to save teachers jobs . " There were tears , both in the audience and from the board members . I have never seen a meeting that was full of that much emotion , " Mr. Stump says . But in the end , the board was unified on budget cuts and teacher layoffs . " Everybody understands that there is an economic crisis , " he says . <p> Setting budgets based on the worst-case scenario is one way for districts to protect themselves if revenues continue to decline , but it 's " a scary thing , " says Edward Kealy , executive director of the Committee for Education Funding , an education coalition in Washington . " Once you lay off teachers , they may not be available if you want them in the coming months . " <p> For Andre Ravenelle , superintendent of the Fitchburg , Mass. , public schools , federal money for low-income and special-education students is a major boost . But it just does n't seem wise to count on the other portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will receive through state stabilization funds . " Either the state or the town could reduce our budget accordingly , " he says . <p> Through a consolidation of middle schools and other cuts , he expects to reduce the district 's staff by about 20 positions . To ensure that some teachers are available for rehire as jobs open up over the next few years , he hopes to create full-time substitute positions - an idea that came up in conversation with other education leaders in the state who are searching for ways to use the stimulus money without falling off a funding cliff when it disappears in two years . <p> The debate over how to use the state stabilization funds has been most pronounced in South Carolina , where Gov . Mark Sanford ( R ) has argued that the money should be used to pay down state debt . A high school senior filed a lawsuit last Thursday trying to force open the way for the legislature to spend the money on schools without the governor 's approval . <p> " There is definitely concern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political pressures within states , " Mr. Kealy says . <p> To keep up pressure to use the money to truly improve schools , the Coalition for Student Achievement was launched last week by more than 30 education , civil rights , business , and philanthropic groups in the US . <p> " It 's awfully hard , when you 're trying to keep teachers in the classroom and school buses running , to be thinking about , ' How do I bring real reform ? But ... the public does n't expect business as usual in any aspect of the economy , " said Bob Wise , president of the Alliance for Excellent Education , a member of the coalition , in a conference call with reporters last week . " No one should think that coming out of the economic crisis with the same educational outcomes is a success . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
