A bug 's life can be key in helping police detectives crack tough murder mysteries . // Investigators collect squirming white maggots from the corpse at a murder scene . Gross ? Sure . Disgusting ? Certainly . But these insects are more than grimy grubs . They are important clues to whodunit and when . Not so long ago , maggots would be washed away as a nuisance , a gruesome reminder of what can happen to a dead body . Now , insects and the scientists who study them are worming their way into courtrooms as witnesses . " Insects found on dead bodies are specific to dead things , " says Dr. Neal Haskell , one of only about 40 experts in the world who gather criminal information from insects . a field called forensic entomology . " We know these insects are coming specifically for the dead body , so that pinpoints a time of death . " Blow Flies Zoom In The first insect witnesses to arrive are big shiny blow flies . " What makes blow flies so important is they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Bullington . Outside on a hot day , the insects arrive almost instantly Indoors , within a day . Blow flies and other insects act as clocks because they grow up in set stages . Adult blow flies fly to a dead body and lay thousands of eggs . Ting eating machines called larvae-or mag gots-soon hatch . The fattened mag gots crawl away from the body to form pupae , and later emerge as adults . Scientists have studied the time it takes for each stage . Pig in Blankets An insect expert can find the largest maggot that has infested a corpse and count backward in the fly 's life cycle to figure out when the person died . Such information can blast a hole in a suspect 's excuse . But what if , say , the body is wrapped in blankets ? How long will it take blow flies to find it then ? That was entomologist Dr. M. Lee Goffs challenge in a case that began in 1989 in Hawaii . So he simulated the crime by wrapping a dead pig in blankets . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies to find the body-information that helped lead to the suspect 's arrest . Often . insect evidence is a niece of a larger puzzle . In one of Dr. Haskell 's cases , the extremely dried and mummified bodies of a man 's two elderly aunts were found in his house when he died in 1987 . Haskell calculated an October death for one aunt because he found remains of a blow fly common in the fall . The other aunt had no blow flies , pointing to death in late December or early January , when blow flies are n't present .

Photograph Even when the adult secondary screwworm ( pictured here under a microscope ) ca n't be found , it open leaves clues behind on a body . Photograph Tallahassee ( Fla. ) police search a crime scene for insect evidence .

The last entry was Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas cards of 10 years previous , but not cards for her birthday the following March . The puzzle was complete . Insects Come in Waves The kinds of insects on a body tell detectives a great deal . " There is a succession , " Dr. Haskell says . " Some insects come early , some in the middle , and some come later as decomposition progresses . " After the blow flies come flesh dies and other flies , then the beetles and other insects such as ants . An entire colony of ants helped Dr. Guff determine how long a body had been in a metal took box . The key evidence was the presence of winged reproductive ants . They would n't develop until 12 months after establishment of the colony . Insects can provide clues in many ways . A body found in the woods with city insects on it indicates it has been moved . Insects can be ground up to test for drugs . Dr. Haskell is even studying insect remains found on ancient dinosaur bones . These bugs on the beat have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never dreamed forensic entomology would take me into so many areas of science : ' Insect Sleuth . Use what you 've learn about forensic entomology to solve these real-ife cases : When a body was found along a riverbank , the man sent to prison for the murder maintained he was innocent . The man had an excuse for several hours before the body was found , but not for the entire week . At a new trial , unhatched blow fly eggs were finally examined and led to the man 's release . Why ? . * Photograph Screwworms ( front ) and green blow flies can poke holes in a suspects excuses . // The unhatched blow fky eggs showed that the body was n't dead more than 24 hours . The man had an excuse for that time . A man told police he found his girlfriend dead , apparently killed by a burglar who came in through an open window . It was a hot day and blow flies had lots of time to find the body next to the open window . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Actually , the boyfriend had killed the woman earlier but returned just before police arrived to open the window tp make it look like a burglary . The blow flies hadn 's yet had time to find the body . Long ago in China , the investigator of a slashing murder had everyone lay their sickles on the ground . Flies landed on just one of the sickles . What did that mean ? The sickle with flies belonged to the murderer . They were attracted to traces of body tissue left on it . <p>
