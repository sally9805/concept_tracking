Chapter One They kill people where I live . They shoot ' em dead for no real reason . You do n't duck , you die . That 's what happened to my brother Jason . He was seven . Playing on our front porch . Laughing . Then some man ran by yelling , " He gon na kill me . He 's gonna- " Before the man finished saying what he had to say , a boy no older than me chased him up our front porch steps . The man yelled for Jason to get out the way . But Jason just stood there crying . Right then , the boy pulls out a gun and starts shooting . Bang ! Guns really sound like that , you know . Bang ! And people bleed from everywhere and blood is redder than you think . Bang ! And little kids look funny in caskets . That 's ' cause they ai n't meant to be in one , I guess . My brother died two years ago . But I ca n't stop thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the front door no more because of the blood . My mother says it 's gone . " See ? " she says , pointing to the porch floor and the gray wooden chairs . " Long gone . " But I can still see it . I can . So I come into the house through the back way . Stepping over the missing stoop Jason used to put his green plastic soldiers in . Opening the iron gate that my dad put up to keep trouble out . Going inside the house and not looking at my brother 's room , because if I even see his door , I cry . And a thirteen-year-old boy ai n't supposed to cry , is he ? The day Jason died I was with Journey-a horse . She stays at Dream-a-Lot Stables , not far from where I live . It 's a broke-down stable where kids hit her with rocks and try to make her eat sticks . But my father , he taught me and Jason to ride Journey , and brush her good . So even though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who owns the stables and rents out broke-down horses for five bucks an hour would let us ride for almost free , long as we cleaned Journey 's stable first . So that morning , after my mom and dad went to work , I left Jason home by hisself . I walked to the stables and brushed the flies and dirt off Journey 's blond coat . I swept up turds as big as turtles , and rode Journey all the way home-up the avenue and past Seventh Street , between honking cars , slow buses , and grown-ups who patted her butt , then got mad when she broke wind in their faces . When I got home , Jason was on the porch . He asked me to play toy soldiers with him . I would n't . Journey was thirsty . So I went around back to get a hose so she could drink . That 's when I heard the man yelling , and Jason screaming my name . I ran to the front of the house . The boy chased the man up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stomped her feet on the pavement . The gun went off . The hose in my hand soaked the porch , squirted the dead man and splashed blood everywhere . Neighbors tried to pull it away from me , but I would n't turn it loose . That 's what they say anyhow . After Jason was gone , I saw a psychologist for six months . But my father did n't like that , so I quit going . " You a man , not no sissy baby girl , " he said when he found me one day behind the couch , crying . My mother got mad at him . " I 'm gon na cry over my baby boy till I die , " she said , hugging me . " Guess Mann here 's gon na cry awhile too . " My father used to be in the army , so he do n't cry much . And he do n't want no boy crying all the time neither . That 's what he tells me anyhow . A week ago my mother told my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , sitting down on the livingroom floor next to me . " It 's been nearly two years since Jason died , and it hurts like it happened this morning . " My father stood behind his favorite brown leather chair . " I do n't need no help . And him , " he said , pointing to me , " ai n't nothing that momma 's boy needs but a good old-fashioned butt-kicking . " I am not a momma 's boy , but since Jason died , that 's what my dad calls me . " People die , " he said . " Little people die too . Get over it . " My mother jumped up . Her knee knocked me in the chin . I held my mouth , because I bit my tongue and I did n't want her feeling bad about that . " So you 're over it , huh ? " she said , running up to the window and pulling back the white curtains . " Yeah , right , " she said , holding on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door in our house . My mother walked past my father and unlocked the drawer to his desk . She picked up his .38 and stuck her arm high in the air like she does when she 's hailing a cab . Then she reached in the drawer with her other hand and pulled out a rusty hunting knife big enough to cut your arm off . " He cries , " she said , looking at me and pointing the gun at my father , " but you , you- " " Shut up , Grace . I 'm warning you . " My mother kept talking . Next thing I knew my father was pulling his gun and knife out her hands and locking them back in the drawer . She hugged him from behind . " He did n't deserve to die . He was sweet and smart and gave hugs when you- " My dad covered his ears with his hands . " Grace ! " She ran to the window and yelled out . " You killed us too ! We look like we still alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her flat stomach . Bit down on her arm . " Ja ... Ja ... " My father shook her . " Do n't say his name ! Do n't ever- " My mother 's eyes are big red circles with black bags under ' em that wo n't go away since Jason died . " He 's gon na be nine in a few months , " she said . " We have to make a cake . Buy him something special . " My dad spit at the trash can . Some made it in . The rest stuck to the outside like a slug . " A dead boy do n't need no presents . I told you that last year . " We always get cakes on our birthdays . And we always sing songs and make the day extra special , not just for me and Jason , but for my mom and dad too . My mother says it would n't be right to leave Jason out now . So she gets him presents he ca n't open and makes him cakes he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . " Grace . He 's gone . And he ai n't never coming back . " I watched her , ' cause I knew them words were gon na get her too sad to make supper , or laugh when the funny shows came on TV tonight . My mother went to the front door and opened it wide . Then she ran onto the porch and yelled for Jason . My dad ran after her . But by the time he got there , she was on her knees picking up little green soldiers we find on the porch sometimes but ca n't figure out just how they get there . She stomped her feet . " Jason . You come home . Come home right now ! " My father kneeled down beside her . He rubbed her lips , then covered up the rest of her words with his fingers . And then he cried , right along with her . Chapter Two Three days later my father apologized . He said he was sorry for making my mother so upset . Sorry for saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . After that , they got dressed and went to the movies . I went to my room and tried to figure out why she could n't figure out that tomorrow he was gon na say them same things all over again . " He ca n't help it , " she says all the time . " He just does n't know what to do with all the things he 's feeling inside . " I know she 's right . Only I get tired of him being mean . He used to be different . He used to take us to the park . Slide down snow hills with us and lie in bed between me and Jason and make up stories about two boys walking from here to China . Then Jason died and so did my dad , kinda . One time , when my mother and him were arguing about the way he treated me , she made me go get some of Jason 's things . I walked over to the middle bookshelf and picked up Jason 's lunch box-the one he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give it here , " my mother said . She opened it . Took out the note . " ' Daddy loves you . ' " My father snatched the napkin out her hand and tore it up . My mother pointed to a Buster Brown shoe box sitting way on top of the bookshelf . " I still got the rest , " she said , talking about the other notes my dad had put in Jason 's lunch box . Have a nice day , they 'd say . Meet me after school for coffee , he 'd write . Only he never gave Jason real coffee-just grape juice in a coffee mug . " Us men have to have something strong now and then , " he 'd say . That always made Jason laugh . I got notes every day too , when I was Jason 's age . But when I turned nine , they stopped . My father took me to the yard right after my birthday party that year , and burned them . " What 's between a father and his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other on mine , " ca n't be burned by fire , washed away by water , or destroyed with human hands . " He squeezed me so hard , I could n't breathe . Then he gave me a note-the same note he gives me every year on my birthday . What we have is forever it says . When I was ten , I got to hold on to the note for ten hours . At thirteen , I kept it for thirteen hours . When my time 's up , I give it back to him until my next birthday . I always liked getting that note . But I do n't believe it no more . Chapter Three I do n't want to go to school no more . But I go . And I put out the trash every Wednesday night , shovel the pavement when it snows , walk my mom to the corner store when it 's dark out , and clean up the house without nobody even asking . I started doing everything right once Jason died , ' cause my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer it gets to his birthday , or the day he was shot , the more I ca n't do like I promised her-make it so she never got a reason to cry over me too . The only one who knows how I really feel about stuff is Kee-lee . We walk to school together . We tease Keisha , a girl Kee-lee likes , and get on our teachers ' nerves asking questions that do n't have nothing to do with the classes they 're teaching . " I ai n't going , " Kee-lee says when I get to his house . He lives up the street from me . We supposed to be headed to school , like every morning . He takes a smoke from behind his ear and lights up . " I 'm tired of school . " I sit down on the new rocker his mother bought off a man driving a truck full of frozen chicken and steaks , gold chains , hats , and porch furniture . " You always saying that . " Kee-lee can hold smoke in his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer . " My mom says I can quit school if I want . " He walks past me with no shirt on and sits on the front steps in his horse-head pajama bottoms . " Hey , Keisha , " he says , calling to her across the street . " Want some of this ? " He shows her his tongue . Her middle finger goes up . " Brush your rotten teeth , stank mouth . " She goes back into her house . Kee-lee laughs and says he knows she likes him . When Kee-lee smiles you see green sitting right next to yellow , and thick white clumps packed close to the gums like hard sugar . Girls do n't say hi when he walks up to them . They say , " I 'll . Brush your teeth . " He brushes them now . But it 's too late . The stuff wo n't come off . Him and me tried . We used a fingernail file once . It made his gums swell up and bleed . We get back to talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure . That 's when the triplets-Mary , Martin , and Moses-come out the house . " Me too , " they say , lining up like they in school , opening the door up wide and going back inside . Kee-lee 's got seven brothers and sisters . I wait for the triplets to come back out . They do n't . I tell Kee-lee he better make them go to school . " Or your mother 's gon na be mad . " " Who 's gon na tell ? " I would never tell on Kee-lee , because he would never tell on me . And he knows stuff about me too . Like how on the day Jason died I ran to his place and cut my wrist with a knife . It was a little knife , but it drew blood . And one time I got so mad over Jason dying that I took rocks to the cocker spaniel in Mrs. Seymour 's yard . Almost killed it . Only Kee-lee knows that . And he ai n't telling . Right when I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thread . She hands ' em to Kee-lee , then sits in his lap , hugging him around the middle . He licks the thread . Sticks it through the needle hole . Knots it . Then sews up the square hole in the side of the shorts she handed him . She jumps off his lap . " Thanks . " He smacks her butt , yelling after her , " Y'all do n't make no mess in there . " Kee-lee 's mom works in the factory way across town . She takes three buses and works double shifts sometimes . So even if he wanted , he could n't get to school every day nohow . Some days he stays home with a sick kid or washes and irons their clothes for school the next day . His mom dropped out in the ninth grade . So did his grandmother and grandfather . So when Kee-lee says he 's quitting , it 's not that big a deal , I guess . " Listen . I got ta go . " Kee-lee covers his mouth when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm hearing when he tells me that they killed Moo Moo last night . Moo Moo is his cousin , and like a brother to me . " He was sitting in his friend 's ride , minding his own business . " Kee-lee 's got this funny look in his eye . " The guy next door told us first . He saw it on the eleven o'clock news . " Bang ! The gun goes off in my head . " I did n't hear about it , " I fell him . " We do n't watch the news no more . " Kee-lee and me say it at the same time . " We is the news . " It 's a joke . Him and me used to say we were gon na be reporters . Take a camera through the neighborhood and show people what it 's really like living here , being us . We were gon na call it We Is the News - Life in the ' Hood . But then we did n't have a camera . And anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the TV for free . " So I figure , " Kee-lee says , " if I 'm gon na die , why I got ta waste the time I do got sitting in school learning stuff l wo n't use ? " I need to get to school , but I do n't move . I 'm hoping Kee-lee 's gon na say he was lying about Moo Moo . So I sit and remember how good he was to me . How him and me painted the porch up the block and made fifty bucks each . He would do stuff like that . Come and get me and Kee-lee . Take us on a job . Let us make some dough sweeping up or washing walls . He talked to me about my dad , too . He always said , " Mann . Give him time . It takes a while to get used to having a piece of you die . " I stand up . Walk down the steps and turn back Kee-lee 's way . " Why 'd he have to die ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , but he was n't all bad neither . But around here , it do n't matter . People get killed , good or bad , big or little . Kee-lee 's eyes tear up . I ask the question again , but I do n't expect no answer . " Why ... Why 'd Moo Moo have to die ? " " That 's just how it goes around here , " Kee-lee says . " You get killed . Just ' cause . " ( Continues ... )
