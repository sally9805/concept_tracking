Hamilton L. Smith of Gambier , OH , patented the process in 1856 and almost immediately sold the patent to Peter Neff who coined the term melainotypes . Melaino was from the Greek word for dark .

Despite the sometimes poor reputation of the tintype , it out-lasted any other 19th century process ! Contemporary tintypists have elevated the tintype into a highly respected art form . <p> For more information and photographs go to : **39;3853;TOOLONG UNEP Launches International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual World Environment Day celebrations , the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) is launching its fourth International Photographic Competition on the Environment , sponsored once again by Canon Inc .

Essays a year ago were all shown as slides using projector and dissolve-unit technology . <p> This year , reports Photo Essay Chairman Connie Houde , only one entry was done using slides . The others utilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that group , one member shot his pictures using negative film and then converted them to positives by scanning , for transfer to a CD . The remaining essays were done digitally all the way , from photographing with digital cameras , sorting and arranging the photos on CDs , and then showing at competition with a digital projector . <p> Helping in the transition is the fact that this is the first year the club has been able to make the digital technology for presenting essays available to members .
