NASA has been known since its creation as the agency of outer space and charged with exploration of that frontier , yet exploration " out there " has led to discovery in the classroom . <p> This is a part of the story about how the program recently recognized by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific ( ASP ) through its presentation of the 2006 Klumpke-Roberts Award  --  NASA 's Space Science Education and Public Outreach ( E/PO ) program  --  was actually planned and implemented . The story is one of bringing about change . It concerns some of the challenges that were met ( and lessons learned ) in planning the program , developing its underlying policies , establishing the processes required to implement those policies , building the infrastructure intended to knit everything together into a coherent whole , and bringing in the talented individuals required to carry out a world-class program . <p> At the beginning of the story in early 1994 , education within NASA 's Office of Space Science ( OSS ) was largely focused on graduate and post-graduate education primarily supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively small number of efforts underway directed towards pre-college and public education supported through modest ( a few thousand dollars ) education supplements to research grants and a handful of larger grants for specific education programs . OSS was spending a little more than $1 million per year on education . The effort to establish a major education group within the Office of Public Outreach at the Space Telescope Science Institute had just been started . A few missions  --  such as the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer  --  had put together mission-oriented education programs . Most space scientists thought that , while doing anything other than graduate education was nice in principle , it was n't really their business . And there was very little understanding as to whether any of the programs underway were actually having any impact on the world of education . <p> By the beginning of 2005 , space science E/PO collectively constituted what may well be the largest single program in astronomy and space science education ever undertaken . E/PO was embedded in every flight mission . More than $40 million per year was being directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants themselves were providing substantial additional resources . More than 1200 members of the space science community were directly participating in the E/PO program . More than 2000 education institutions and organizations were involved in hundreds of space science E/PO activities , and those activities were , collectively , reaching millions of people per year . Major efforts were underway to assess the effectiveness and impact of the E/PO program . And the conversation within the space science community concerning the legitimacy and desirability of participating in E/PO work was clearly different than it had been ten years earlier . Have a Plan <p> The space science E/PO program was based on a set of plans that took almost three years to develop  --  an unusually long period of time in a political environment that generally wants to see immediate results . In retrospect , the meticulous planning that was done , and the thought , care , and effort that went into that planning was , I believe , one of the primary sources of the program 's success <p> The planning was actually performed in two phases . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive external review ) led to the March 1995 publication of a strategic plan entitled Partners in Education : A Strategy for Integrating Education and Public Outreach into NASA 's Space Science Programs . That plan , which drew heavily on ideas developed by a number of people prior to my involvement in the program , laid out two key fundamental principles : <p> The unique assets that OSS could bring to E/PO were centered on the extraordinary stream of scientific discoveries emerging from OSS missions and research programs , and the contributions that the space science community could make to education by working in close collaboration with the education community . <p> E/PO would be built into every aspect of OSS 's work rather than being a thin veneer of education layered on top of business as usual . <p> When the Space Science Advisory Committee ( SScAC ) reviewed the E/PO Strategic Plan in June 1996 , the Committee said that , while it appreciated all the nice words , it wanted to know what specific actions were going to be taken to turn the rhetoric into reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Committee raised an absolutely fair set of questions . And it was at that point that everything began to take a totally new direction  --  a direction that could never have been anticipated by anyone responsible for the previous work . <p> SScAC proceeded to create a Task Force to develop a comprehensive set of recommendations concerning how the program should actually be implemented . The Committee was unlike any group I had ever seen , bringing together leading members of both the space science research and education communities with individuals from various parts of NASA . It became rapidly clear that the different groups had very different ideas concerning who best understood the problems and the issues , what was important for education , what role OSS could best play in education both inside and outside of NASA , how scientists could most effectively participate in E/PO , and on just about every other issue that arose . The subsequent year-long process was intense , argumentative , frustrating , exhausting , exhilarating , and , ultimately , extraordinarily creative as people eventually began to focus on the assignment they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and come together . But I wondered for a very long time whether the group was ever going to be able to arrive at an agreement on anything . There were a few people on that group who I sometimes dreamt about strangling by the time we were done  --  these were also the people who contributed some of the most interesting ideas . Eventually I came to realize that if you really do want new ideas , you have to bring in new people . But there is no point bringing in such people , unless you are really going to be receptive to novel ideas , and willing to actually put into play something that is genuinely new . <p> The group challenged everything and took nothing for granted . During its first meeting ( at that point I was not really sure there was ever going to be a second meeting ) , one of the nationally known educators on the Task Force looked at me very skeptically and said very firmly that she was a big fan of NASA , and that , if NASA really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she was prepared to do whatever was needed to help . But , she continued , if NASA was only interested in creating a thin faade of education as a near-term political ploy for justifying its own budget , then she was going to get up and walk out of the room . I remember swallowing very hard at that point ( I could easily imagine the whole group getting up and walking out with her ) and assuring her that OSS really was serious about developing a substantive education program , and we valued and welcomed her involvement . She finally sat back down and stayed . That was only one of the early examples of the very large number of provocative questions that were raised and considered throughout the course of the study . Some of those issues are still very much alive today . <p> In retrospect , the resulting Implementation Plan , published in November 1996 and titled Implementing the Office of Space Science Education/Public Outreach Strategy , provided an extraordinarily powerful blueprint for proceeding to organize , orchestrate , and develop the actual program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of issues that had to be dealt with in order to realize that approach , and laid out just about everything that needed to be done in a very systematic way . The approach that it took was different from anything that had ever been tried before . That turned out to be simultaneously a major virtue and a substantial liability . Starting Something New is Never Easy <p> The Implementation Plan was ( and is ) a very complex and sophisticated document . I 've often been questioned about this complexity . My answer has always been very simple : NASA 's science planning is also very complex and sophisticated . Why should the same rigor , discipline , and sophistication not be applied to education ? <p> The fact that the Implementation Plan presented a systems approach  --  meaning that a substantial number of individual elements had to work together in an integrated and holistic way  --  meant that a number of major processes , such as a peer-review process for the education components of proposals , and an entire organizational infrastructure ( the E/PO Support Network ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to test how the total system actually worked . Funding for a number of system-wide support services also had to be secured before anything else could happen . And a very large number of individuals and groups had to be briefed about the content of the Plan and had to be convinced to sign up to support it before any tangible progress could be made . Just putting all of the necessary pieces in place took well over a year . And then , of course , everything had to be tried and tested . <p> Both within NASA and within significant segments of the space science community , initial reactions ranged from mildly skeptical to overtly hostile . <p> Following the publication of the Implementation Plan , I received a large number of letters and electronic mail messages from both inside and outside of NASA telling me that the Plan made no sense at all and could not possibly work . I was told that everything could be done internally by the Education Offices at the NASA Centers . Why was OSS proposing to bring in all these outside people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they needed ? Where was the program ? Where were the milestones ? Where were the metrics ? The Plan was all about process . Surely it should spell out things like the details of how many teacher workshops would be carried out for the next ten years and whether Teacher Resource Centers should be open on weekends ! ! <p> More than one angry Program Manager showed up at my office door saying that funds for their mission were particularly tight , and they had absolutely no intention of diverting any scarce resources into something as irrelevant as education . I calmly ( or sometimes not so calmly ) informed them that E/PO was now an important part of the justification for the space science program , and that the new funding policies would be followed . <p> Early attempts to embed E/PO into OSS Research Announcements and Announcements of Opportunity were seriously compromised by a number of individuals within OSS who seemed to be attempting to revise the policies and turn them into what they wanted . The resulting inconsistencies in approach created enormous confusion in the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that confusion was enormously compounded when funding commitments for the support of E/PO elements of research grants vanished just as the first selections were about to be announced . <p> I learned that the funds were no longer there at the very last minute , and , of course , there was no way to explain the actual situation to the outside world . The results were disastrous . It does n't take much to wreck your credibility when people are already skeptical about what you are trying to do . And , once compromised , it takes a very long time to restore trust . <p> Fortunately , throughout all of this startup period , most of OSS top management , as well as many other people , supported what I was doing , and the new policies and the new processes slowly began to take hold . The required funding started to appear . And the eventual appearance of substantial funding went a long way towards establishing the credibility of OSS 's efforts in education with the outside world . As was stated in the Implementation Plan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> While all of this was going on within OSS , similarly challenging interactions with the space science research community also took place . Many of the discussions actually led to significant and constructive changes . While it is easy to be annoyed by constant criticism , it is also important to listen carefully to that criticism . Once in a while , some of the conversations even turned out to be entertaining . One of the best went something like this : <p> Space Scientist : " Well , I 've listened to your presentation on this program for fifteen minutes , and I do n't understand any of it . What you are doing obviously ca n't be any good . " <p> JDR : " It 's taken nearly twenty years for the very sophisticated and complex space science mission you 've been working on to come to reality . Why do you think education is any less complicated to deal with ? " <p> Space Scientist : " It 's only education . It 's not rocket science . " <p> JDR : " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is brain surgery . " <p> I think one of the most important things that finally convinced people that we were actually on to something was the growing visibility of a large array of programs and the increasing ( and increasingly well-documented ) evidence that those programs were , in fact , reaching large audiences and starting to have an impact . <p> There was just too much going on to ignore . Traveling exhibitions were touring the country . Space-science-centered programs appeared on public television . Educational materials were being used by major school districts . Innovative programs were underway with community-based organizations such as the Girl Scouts . Conferences were being held to exchange ideas and experiences . And a large number of leading educational organizations had learned that they could work productively with OSS and the space science community . Most of those organizations were n't interested in talking to OSS when the program was first being planned . Results do get attention ! Watch What 's Happening ( and Act ) <p> Throughout the first several years of actual implementation , great care was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with problems as they arose . When you are starting something brand new , it is critical never to stop questioning and re-examining what you are doing , acknowledge failures when they occur , and fix what needs to be fixed . <p> The OSS Education Council , consisting of the leads of the organizations within the OSS E/PO Support Network plus other key individuals responsible for education in other parts of NASA , played a key role in keeping me honest . During the seven years that I worked with this group , it was quick to identify problems and , even more importantly , propose practical solutions to those problems . This set of talented ( and very vocal ) individuals who were located in organizations across the country  --  and who spent much time talking to both the space science and education communities about what was and was n't working  --  generated information that could not have been obtained by one or two people working in Washington who were trying to deal simultaneously with a broad range of issues . <p> In order to develop a completely independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of issues , I brought in an external evaluator to work with me to understand a wide variety of critical issues . How well was the Support Network functioning , particularly in the critical early stages when everyone was trying to understand their roles in the system ? What are the principal factors influencing the willingness and ability of space scientists to participate effectively in E/PO ? Was there evidence as to whether the program was actually having any impact on the intended audiences ? What are the characteristics of effective programs and what do those characteristics tell us about how future programs should be carried out ? Were there major problems affecting the performance of the entire system that need to be addressed ? It is impossible to overstate how valuable those independent sets of eyes and ears were , and the enormous influence they had on the program . I do n't think I would have ever understood , for example , the critical role of communications in a distributed system without this external perspective . <p> Significant changes were made on the basis of all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities being carried out at one of the NASA Field Centers had major problems , responsibility for peer review was pulled back to NASA Headquarters and the procedures used were totally revised . The processes initially used for incorporating E/PO into Research Announcements and research grants had obviously failed , and they were subsequently totally revised as well . When the Explorer and Discovery Programs went to a two-step selection process , it quickly became apparent that requiring E/PO to be included in the initial proposals was generating too much meaningless work . We then decided to require E/PO Plans only for the second stage of the competition . Of course , there were then people who loudly complained that we seemed to be always making changes ( so we must not know what we were doing ) , but we were really only making those changes in response to what we were being told  --  sometimes by those same people . Try to imagine a dog chasing its tail and succeeding . <p> Eventually , most of the significant problems did get fixed . Listening really is important ! So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . Some Final Reflections <p> The ten years spent planning and implementing the space science E/PO program was a truly remarkable experience for me . In many ways , it was like riding the world 's largest roller coaster  --  filled with beautiful views from the heights , stomach-churning drops , and head-spinning curves . But , in this case , the ride was clearly worth it because of the results they produced . In the final analysis , it is only the quality of the program that counts , and this program 's numerous accomplishments have been well documented and speak for themselves . They should be a source of pride to everyone involved . <p> The distributed approach that was at the heart of the Implementation Plan has proven itself to be very powerful , but it does introduce its own set of problems . And it certainly is at odds with the usual centralized government command and control culture . The approach has had the virtue of bringing the program much closer to the grassroots in understanding the needs of the education system , and identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E/PO . It has encouraged individuals to be very opportunistic in pursuing potential new directions without having to always stop and ask for permission to proceed . Allowing that kind of license , in turn , requires having capable people around you whose insight , judgment , integrity , and ability can be totally trusted . <p> Talent counts . I firmly believe that the Plan and the resulting program primarily succeeded because of the talent that was brought in ( particularly from outside of NASA ) and the focus on partnerships . The best people became participants and were allowed to be creative . I worked very hard to establish an environment in which ideas and innovation could thrive and everyone could focus on the content and quality of what was being done . The evident talent and demonstrable accomplishments of the people that were brought in were also critical in establishing credibility with the education community and in establishing partnerships with that community . As a result , programs were done with the education community and not to them . <p> Time also counts . It was important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was lucky to be able to do that . The political system is not usually particularly patient  --  you have thirty days to develop your detailed plans for the next ten years ! Fortunately , when the OSS E/PO program was put together , education at NASA operated below the political radar screen . It took an enormous amount of time and effort to create plans , develop policies , establish procedures , select the organizations that formed the Support Network , and to begin to build the necessary deep connections with both the space science and the education communities . Participating organizations within the OSS E/PO Support Network took a long time to understand their own roles within the total system and to learn how to work together . And the focus on pre-college and public education represented a culture change for the space science community . Culture changes always take a very long time to realize . <p> Unfortunately , as the events of the past few years have shown , it is also impossible to isolate any program  --  no matter how good  --  from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we live with a political system that has discontinuities and abrupt changes in direction built into the very fabric of the system . <p> When education was declared to be one of the " Core Missions of NASA , " it started to become driven to a significant degree by purely political and public relations considerations  --  apparent prime interests of the new management team that was brought in . And the ever-increasing needs of the bureaucracy started to overwhelm everything else . I am not sure whether it would be possible to put together the space science E/PO Program in the political environment that now exists . Budgets have been cut , and serious questions have recently been raised about many of the elements of the program that I believe have been directly responsible for making it work so well . NASA has dearly rethought its commitment to education and the role of education in the Agency . I do not agree with many of the decisions that have been made , but that is the way our political system works . That system also only works properly when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't like . Despite the current situation , I believe that a lasting legacy has now been established and that the approach OSS took to planning and carrying out its E/PO program could be a model for NASA itself and for other scientific communities and other agencies . Based on that approach , we have all learned that it is possible to bring a significant fraction of a scientific community into pre-college and public education in a meaningful way , and , in so doing , change the nature of the conversation in that community concerning the legitimacy and importance of participating in E/PO . Indeed , <p> it is possible to bring the scientific and education communities together to create genuine partnerships directed towards providing new kinds of educational experiences based on current science ; <p> it is possible to create a comprehensive and visionary approach to carrying out an education program and see it actually work ; and <p> it is even possible to create a new profession  --  a profession that is now the focus of much of the ASP 'S current activities . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , sometimes , unintended consequences are even more interesting than the intended ones . <p> Finally , in accepting this year 's Klumpke-Roberts Award from the ASP , I am acting as the representative of a very large number of people who have played many different roles and contributed in many different ways to the success of the space science E/PO program . They are the ones who have brought the energy and the creativity to the program , and who have really done all the work while I was functioning largely as a planner and as an orchestra conductor . It would be impossible to single out specific individuals without being unfair to someone . But the key people know who they are . They are the ones who should be thanked for showing what can be done , and , in so doing , bringing the wonders and excitement of space science to educators , children , and families across the country and around the world . <p> MAP : The formation of partnerships with a wide variety of leading educational organizations across the country has been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collaborations with nearly four hundred such organizations in FY 2005 brought space-science-related educational activities to every state in the country .

ROSENDHAL retired from NASA in September 2004 after more than thirty years with the Agency , the last ten of which were spent planning , implementing , and leading the Office of Space Science 's Education and Public Outreach Program . <p> OSS E/PO Program Underlying Principles <p> The planning and implementation of the OSS E/PO program have been based on a small number of basic operating principles that , in practice , have proven to be particularly powerful . In particular , the overall approach has been centered on : <p>  --  The direct involvement of the space science community . <p>  --  Embedding education and outreach as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A focus on creating partnerships between space scientists and educators to ensure that the needs of educators are being met . <p>  --  Working through partners to create high-leverage state , regional , and national opportunities . <p>  --  Establishment of a national education support network to : <p> Facilitate the establishment of partnerships between space scientists and educators ; <p> Identify especially promising high-leverage opportunities ; <p> Coordinate and integrate programs across individual missions ; <p> Provide a common set of services to the science and education communities . <p>  --  A strong emphasis on evaluating the quality and effectiveness of E/PO efforts through a variety of mechanisms .  --  J. D. R. <p> <p> Concluding Remarks ( Taken from the OSS E/PO Implementation Plan ) <p> The 1996 OSS Education Implementation Plan provided a blueprint for an extremely ambitious program to be undertaken realistically . As was stated in the " Concluding Remarks " to that Plan : <p> " The Task Force believes that , by forming appropriate partnerships with the education community , by consciously and deliberately seeking the highest leverage opportunities through such partnerships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its education program , OSS and the OSS research community can make a significant and lasting contribution to improving education and raising the public understanding of science . <p> Many space scientists are already willingly and enthusiastically involved in education and outreach . The systems approach outlined in this Implementation Plan should serve to channel the efforts of the space research community in the most productive directions while still encouraging individual initiative and creativity . It should promote the best use of the time and talents of OSS-supported scientists and the unique results being obtained from OSS research programs and space-flight missions . It should help foster a wide range of alliances between the research and education communities and , in so doing , contribute to the solution of significant national problems . <p> The overall approach described in this Report is an experiment . The focus on process as the centerpiece of this experiment , rather than on the identification of a set of specific programs , represents a deliberate choice by the Task Force to depart from the practice of simply creating a collection of stand-alone activities having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enormous amplification of OSS 's education/outreach efforts . The only way to tell whether the experiment will work is to try it . Flexibility will be required , progress on the experiment will have to be monitored closely , and adjustments made on an ongoing basis . <p> Realistic expectations are important . No single education or outreach program undertaken or sponsored by OSS will , by itself , have a significant , long-term , sustainable impact on the American educational system . Rather , it will be the total effect of a broad ensemble of high-leverage activities carried out over a long period of time which can make a difference . A long-term commitment is crucial for success . OSS must be prepared to make such a long-term commitment if it is to achieve its Education and Public Outreach goals . The space science community must be prepared to make such a commitment if they are to demonstrate their ability to contribute to larger national goals and , in so doing , enhance the case for continued support of their research . " <p> These words are still appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
