// With an enclosed bridge to rival that of a riverboat , Carver 's new 506 aft-cabinmotoryacht features all-climate control and spacious accommodations . When you first see Carver 's new motoryacht you are immediately struck with its unconventional look and commanding presence . What appears to be a 60- or 65-footer with enclosed bridge is in fact a 50-foot aft-cabin model designed with Carver 's signature feature-an amazing amount of living and cruising space . Because form follows function , Carver has successfully worked from the inside out to offer a cruising motoryacht for those who are moving up from the sun-drenched layouts of the big express cruisers and want the privacy and comfort of an aft-cabin design . This boat is also attractive to mid-life couples who now have extended families and/or entertain a lot . It 's a yacht with capacity for long cruises in both hot and cold climates at a price that 's way below the millions required for world-hopping offshore custom yachts . The untraditional look , with oval windows and sculptured features , is a direct result of the flush-deck raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35- and 45-foot versions . Though stylish , these features are not simply for looks . They are there for a reason ; actually a multitude of reasons .

Photograph GRACIOUS LIVING : A master stateroom aft for private slumber // First , the windows both in the salon and on the bridge are positioned to enhance lines of sight . When seated in the salon , you can see out through the lower ovals while , when standing , open views are made possible by the second tier of wraparound windshields . On the bridge , the helmsman can not only see well ahead of the boat , but has good views aft for docking and undocking . The big windows and wide wing doors supply great views for those lounging on the aft deck . Not only is the raised gunwale calculated to provide adequate views from the inside , it also provides secure walkways forward to the flush deck bow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the bridge/aft-deck enclosure and the enormous amount of space found below decks in the three-stateroom , three-head , aft-cabin layout . The enclosed flybridge with all-climate control is , in fact , a $30,000 option , but one that everyone should really consider . The hardtop covers the bridge and is designed to include the aft deck lounge Continued on page 122 area as well . What this enclosure offers is comfortable cruising , be it in the cold waters of Maine and the Great Lakes or in the torrid zones of the subtropics . An integral part of the enclosure is an electronically controlled sun roof that slides back at the flip of a switch to let in the invigorating air . Should the weather turn foul , it closes easily . Though the boat does come with an open bridge and aft deck or with canvas enclosures , it 's the hardtop model that is truly outstanding , with three-seat helm , Lshaped settee and wet bar , all on the bridge . Below the bridge is a huge layout . The salon is the result of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4in. beam . This cavernous area can be furnished attractively for sit-down entertaining and conversation . ( Check out the secret reclining couch . ) You can see out leak-proof windows and the view is not lost when standing . You do n't ever feel the restriction of the raised-gunwale design . Even the galley has been designed with only a small " casual step " down so whoever is readying the meals is still seen and heard . Forward of the salon/galley/dining room area are two staterooms , each with its own head . First , there 's the primary guest cabin with full head and shower . Ample storage is available even beneath the queen-size bed . The second cabin ( third stateroom ) is purely functional with two bunks that could be tagged as quarter berths . Kids will love it . A fine finish But , it 's the master stateroom , located in the stem for privacy , that really attracts the attention . It is engineered as an athwartships design with lots of storage and hanging lockers . The two amazing features in this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the split head arrangement whereby the commode is in one enclosure , separate from the full shower-with-tub in the opposite enclosure . A vanity is located between the two " closets . " Highlighted in the master stateroom as well as throughout the yacht is the fit-andfinish of the woodwork . It is impressive and club-like . There is more furniture finish here than I 've seen in many a yacht . The engine room , of course , is as spacious as the rest of the boat . Any captain can easily perform daily checks , while mechanics can quickly get to any piece of gear for maintenance or repair work . This includes both sides of the engines . Depending on engine option , the Carver 506 will cruise quite comfortably at 25 mph and top out from 30 to 33 mph . Specially designed four-bladed props are held in place by massive pocket-mounted struts . Hefty trim tabs can be adjusted for running performance of the modified-V hull . Wide chines provide good stability , while side-dumping exhausts cut down on the fumes aft . The drive-train elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuverability . Smooth acceleration without vibration is evident at startup and in tight turns at speed . Backing and filling is very easy while docking is a snap , especially with the optional bow thruster . Our captain , Arthur Grin of Bob Stella Marine in Palm Beach , Florida , put the 506 with swim platform in a dock space no more , I believe , than 60 feet long , a tight fit . With its untraditional style and its wonderful accommodations , Carver 's new 506 is bound to become a classic in years to come , especially with a sevenyear transferable warranty . // Carver 506 Motoryacht // <p>
