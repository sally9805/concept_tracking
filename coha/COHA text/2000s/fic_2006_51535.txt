In regard to this story , Bruce McAllister reports that he continues to meet intelligence analysts and operatives whose stories are well worth fictionalizing . He could tell us more , but then he 'd have to kill us all . If his latest story leaves you with an increased desire to wash your hands , rest assured you 're not alone . In fact , you 're never alone . <p> THE RETIRED OPERATIVE SPEAKS TO A CLASS YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN FOR your country . I 'm sixty-eight years old and even in high school - it's2015 now , so that was fifty years ago - I wanted to be an intelligence analyst ... an analyst for an intelligence agency , or if I could n't do that , at least be a writer for the United States Information Agency , writing books for people of limited English vocabularies so they 'd know about us , our freedoms , the way we live . But what I wanted most was to be an analyst - not a covert-action operative , just an analyst . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies . That 's what I wanted to do for my country . I knew they looked at your high school record , not just college - and not just grades , but also the clubs you were in and any sports . And your family background , that was important too . My father was an Annapolis graduate , a Pearl Harbor survivor and a gentle Cold War warrior who 'd worked for NATO in northern Italy , when we 'd lived there . I knew that would look good to the Agency , and I knew that my dad had friends who 'd put in a good word for me , too , friends in the Office of Naval Intelligence . But I also knew I had to do something for my high school record ; and I was n't an athlete , so I joined the Anti-Communist Club . I thought it was going to be a group of kids who 'd discuss Marxist economics and our freemarket system , maybe the misconceptions Marx had about human nature , and maybe even mistakes we were making in developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were giving them . I did n't know it was just a front for Barry Goldwater and that all we were going to do was make election signs , but at least I had it on my record . Because a lot of Agency recruiting happens at private colleges , I went to one in Southern California - not far from where my parents lived . My high school grades were good enough for a state scholarship , and my dad covered the rest . It was the " 60s , but the administration was conservative ; and I was expecting the typical Cold War Agency recruitment to happen to me the way it had happened to people I 'd heard about-the sons of some of my dad 's friends . But it did n't . I went through five majors without doing well in any of them ; and it was n't until my senior year , when I was taking an IR course with a popular prof named Booth - a guy who 'd been a POW in WWn - that I mentioned what I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy - classified stuff - at Stanford ; and I figured that if I was about to graduate I 'd better tell someone , anyone , what I really wanted to do in life : Not sell insurance or be a middle manager or a government bureaucrat , but work for a civilian intelligence agency - get a graduate degree on their tab maybe - and be an analyst . I could tell he wanted to laugh , but he did n't . He was a good guy . The administration did n't like him because he never went to faculty meetings ; and he did n't act like a scholar , even though he had his doctorate , and he was n't on campus much . But when they tried to fire him , the students protested-carried signs , wrote letters , and caused enough of a scene that they kept him . This was back in the " 60s when you did this kind of thing . He was smiling at me and I could see those teeth-the ones he had n't taken good enough care of in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone now , replaced years ago with dentures . He looked at me for a long time , very serious , and said , " I could put in a good word for you at the USIA . You 're a good writer , Matt . " " I 'd rather be an analyst . " " Have you thought about the FBI ? " I had to laugh at that . " Okay , " he said , laughing too . " I should n't be doing this . Your grades are terrible and I ca n't say much about you except that you 're a good writer . In fact , I 'm not sure why I 'm even considering this . You 're a pretty tame guy . You 're even tamer than I was your age and I was pretty tame . I stole hubcaps at least . " We both laughed . He got serious . " You want to do something for your country , right ? " " Yes . " " But you do n't want to join the military like your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to join the military . " " Right . " " No one 's enlisting these days anyway , " he said . " Ca n't blame them . JFK and his brightest are n't fighting this war very well . Look at the Chinese - how those crossborder ops brought them in . Jack 's greenbeanie darlings . " " Yes , sir . " " And the Army wo n't take you anyway , right ? " " Yes . I 've got some scoliosis , and you can see how thick my glasses are , sir . " " That 's what I thought . What you need to do is send for the Agency application . Make two Xeroxes of it , send one to me , you with it . You 'll have to have a physical , just like the Army , and a polygraph , and you 'll have to have your doctor send your records . How does your dad feel about this ? " " My dad 's always been for it , " I answered . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " No , " he said quickly , grinning , " I have n't been talking to your dad , but people say he 's a good man . " What people ? " You 're right , " I said . " He 's not political , and neither am I , I guess . " " Maybe that 's why I 'm doing this . " " Sir ? " " You ca n't analyze a situation if you 're blinded by your own politics , Matt . " " You 've taught us that , sir . " He laughed again . " And you do n't have to kiss ass , Matt . Remember that in the interview . Either they want you or they do n't and either way you 'll never figure out exactly why . " SOME PEOPLE - maybe one in one hundred thousand - can get infected by an epidemic disease and not get sick and die . They do n't even get the symptoms , but they can carry it and they can give it to others . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . You 've heard of Typhoid Mary maybe , in health class or history . She was one . Not to the degree that the history books say she was , but she was . She did n't even know she was one until they told her how many people she 'd probably killed ; but she was one and it drove her crazy to find out . It drove her crazy and the government dropped their case against her . That was about 1910 , I think , and it was here in America , during an epidemic . That 's how hard it can be on a person when they find out they 're a carrier . That 's what I 'm saying , I guess . I do n't know whose pull did it . I know it was n't my record . The AntiCommunist Club certainly would n't have been enough and my grades in college were n't very good , though Booth was right . I was a good writer . Both of my parents were good writers . My mom had a master 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admirals he served . Maybe it was the writing , but I also knew they could get all the 1600 SAT and 4.0-GPA graduates they wanted - who were better writers than I was - so it had to be something else . It had to be Booth or one of my father 's friends or even the fact that my dad was about to retire as a rear admiral . However it happened , I got called into an interview in Los Angeles in the middle of summer after graduation . The man wore a short-sleeve shirt with a loud red tie and did n't seem very interested . I panicked , thinking , " Shit , he 's just interviewing me so the Agency can tell Booth or my Dad 's friends they did , but they 're not really interested . " That 's how it felt . At one point the man did look up at me with interest , like he was waking up , when I said stupidly , " I feel like I really do n't have a country . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , and tried to backpedal . " I do n't mean that in patriotic terms . I do n't mean - " " I know you do n't mean it in patriotic terms , " he said impatiently . " You 're the Cold War son of a Cold War father , Mr. Hudson . Even if you had long hair and were running around with posters saying KILL THE FASCIST PIGS ! , you 'd still be your father 's son and I would n't doubt your patriotism . " He stopped himself and I did n't know whether to believe him . " So how do you mean it ? " he said . I took a deep breath . " My dad 's a career Navy man , and my mother 's a teacher . We moved around a lot and my father is a kind man and my mother loves people of all races , all cultures , so it 's a little hard to talk about home towns and wave the American flag the way some people wave it .... " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptive young man , Mr. Hudson . That 's what we 're looking for , but I do n't think you 've finished your answer , do you ? " " Sir ? " " How do you wave the American flag ? " " I guess I do n't , sir . It 's not my style . I do n't burn the flag-that would be wrong - but I do n't wave it . I do n't need to . I see the United States as a good country , one that should be defended at all costs because history does n't see enough good countries . " " You learn that in college ? " " I was thinking it before - when my dad was stationed with NATO in Italy , when I was younger - but , yes , I learned that from a college professor of mine , too . " He was nodding . " I think I know which prof you 're talking about , and he 's right . It 's an experiment , our society-the most successful experiment in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " " Thank you for coming in today , Mr. Hudson . We 'll let you know if we decide another interview would be helpful . " What they were looking for was not just somebody who could carry the plague without getting sick - your normal CAC - but someone whose body could get rid of the disease fast with the right antibiotics what you 'd call " designer antibiotics " these days . Experimental . Even classified . And definitely not yet PDA-approved . And it could n't be a genetically engineered plague . That would be discovered pretty quickly and you would n't be able to deny it . Everyone would know it was GW germ warfare - so they had to use good old-fashioned plague . Bubonic , the Black Death of the Middle Ages , the Great Dying . History 's had a lot of names for it . It had to be " natural . " And it was n't any good if it took the carrier days or a week or more to get clean . If it still showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the quarantine areas ; he 'd never be able to get out of the field and sit the crisis out - back in the States or somewhere - until he was needed again . They 'd already found one carrier - a guy they could use - but he went crazy in the field halfway through his first mission and they had to pull him . I did n't hear about him until much later . I wish I 'd heard earlier . I waited two months working in the sports section of a K-Mart . I 'd given up , in fact , ever hearing from them when a different guy called to set up another interview , this time in Riverside . There would be a physical just after the interview , he said , and I needed to be able to give urine and blood samples . I do n't remember exactly what I said in the interview or even what the guy said . He was interested at first , asking me about my relationship with my father - which I told him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rewarding in my college courses . One on " economic sanctions and North-South relations , " I said , and another on the impact of military invasion on the cultural history of Vietnam . He perked up hearing that , but after that lost interest again . I do n't know whether it was the questions he had to ask - they bored him - or my answers to them - which were boring too - but all I remember is saying " Yes " and " No " a lot and not much else . So I was n't surprised two weeks later to get a letter turning me down . I knew I 'd get something in writing so they could tell Booth and my dad 's friends and anyone else that they 'd considered me " very carefully " and sent me a nice letter . I was getting ready to apply - my father had offered to help and I had some savings - to graduate school , for an MBA at a state college , when someone called from the L.A. office again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent . They wanted me to come in for another interview and more blood tests . I could n't imagine what had changed their minds . I should explain what a " vector " is ? A vector is how a disease - an epidemic - is spread . In the case of Yeisenia pestis - the classic plague - it 's carried not by a rat , but by a flea on the rat . It 's very interesting actually . There are three main forms of plague : bubonic , pneumonic , and septicmie . Bubonic is the most famous . It 's the form you see in etchings from the Middle Ages - what was called the Black Death . Incubation which is how long it takes you to come down with it-is two to five days , and your lymphatic system tries to deal with it , but ca n't . Your lymph nodes swell up and they 're so full of the bacteria , the bacteria 's toxins , that they 're like knobs on your skins . These are called " buboes " - and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . You also get a red rash . This is the " ring around the rosies " that the old nursery rhyme is referring to . It 's a terrible way to die . Your temperature gets up to 103-106 . Your blood pressure 's so low you ca n't stand up , and you 've got to watch these things , these big bumps , growing on you . You 're becoming something else - your body is changing completely - and even if you 're delirious , you hate what you 're becoming . You 're rotting , actually rotting , and you can smell it . I 've never had the symptoms , but I know what that feels like-to hate what you 're becoming . The second form is called " pneumonic " - like the word pneumonia . It fills your lungs . You get it from what 's called " aerial droplet transmission " - which means from the air . It goes straight to your lungs and you come down with a pneumonia that 's actually plague . You can even get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their sneezing . This kind takes half as long to come down with . You get a splitting headache , chills , fever , and before you know it you 're coughing up blood . It looks like strawberry jelly - even the doctors describe it that way . Your lungs are dying and you get to watch . With this kind if you do n't get treatment , you always die . The worst form - septicemic - is n't very common , fortunately , but I should mention it anyway , so you 'll know . In this kind the flea is so full of the germ that when it bites you - just one bite - when it tries to suck blood from you - the germs backwash into your bloodstream , and you get infected instantly . You die in twenty-four hours . Your blood is crawling with the bacteria - it just ca n't handle it - and that 's how you die , poisoned by living things crawling through your bloodstream . Actually there 's a fourth type , a meningitis plague - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's even less common . Its code in epidemiological circles is A20.7 . You do n't hear about it . The kind they wanted me to spread - the only kind I could spread was pneumonic . I 'd cough , and the coughing would spread it , but once the pneumonic gets started you see the first type too , the bubonic . That 's what they wanted . Something fast to get it started , but then both kinds appearing so that it could n't be traced . It 's important to know the history of things . That 's what Booth always said and that 's what they said at Langley , and it 's true . In the old days - when they first had a drug for the plague , in the early 190Os - they used sulfonamides . That 's the fancy name for sulfur drugs . Back in the Middle Ages the guy with all the prophecies - Nostradamus - was so smart he invented an herbal treatment that was actually pretty good . It had rose petals , evergreen needles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the entire population of Europe with that . You could n't even save twenty percent . Even if everyone had believed it would work , there would n't have been enough roses . So the sulfur drugs in the early 1900s were n't very good , but they were better than nothing and they could have cut the Black Death mortality rate by fifty percent . Later , what 's called the tetracycline drugs came in and these cured people quickly . That 's why you only get a couple of plague cases every year in the U.S. , and they 're out on Indian reservations or in the woods in a national park somewhere , someone getting bitten by a squirrel maybe . But if you 've got a Third World country , what we used to call an " LDC " - a " Lesser Developing Country " - you could n't necessarily get the drugs , either quickly or at all , and maybe thousands would get infected and thousands would die . Especially if you did n't want them to get the drugs . If , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you did n't want that kind of leadership in that country - where American businesses had factories and relied on certain kinds of privileges , and because , you saw communism as a threat to our way of life - you could keep the drugs from getting to it . If the country could n't get the drugs fast enough and enough people died , the country would become " destabilized . " And if there was a group like the military or a landowner with the army 's backing ready to overthrow the president , that was the time to do it . You know what I 'm saying . I 'm not talking politics here . I 'm just saying how it was back then . I 'm sure you 've heard about some of these things before . In World War II the Japanese tried plague on China and killed a couple of hundred Chinese , but also one of their own companies of soldiers . They were also , later in the war , planning to try it on San Diego , California , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all the old Agency stories - the news media coverage , the " black ops , " the assassinations of heads of state , the secret support of coups d ' tat - all those covert actions that got the intelligence community in trouble in the 1970s . You 've heard about those things , I 'm sure . They did n't want me as an intelligence analyst . They wanted me to do this other work for them - in countries where they needed it done . I needed training for that - any twenty-two-year-old would have - and it was the kind any overseas operative would get . In my case it was training for South America . It lasted sixteen weeks - they taught me Spanish and E &E,; escape and evasion - and gave me some medic training , some reporter-skills training ( I 'll talk about that in a minute ) , and some firearms training - which was pretty funny with my bad eyesight . Right before I left for all that training I went to visit my parents . I could n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . All I could say was , " I 'm about to work for the intelligence community , Dad . But not as an analyst . I 'm heading out in two days for sixteen weeks of training . " " I thought that might be what was happening , Matt , " he told me with a smile , but I could tell he was worried . Analysts live safe lives . Field operatives do n't always . " You have n't been saying much recently . " " You 're right , " I said . " That was why . " I could n't tell them what I 'd be doing . I could n't tell anyone . Even if I 'd been allowed to , how could I ? " I know I ca n't ask you anything about it , Matt , and that 's okay , " my dad said . " During the war in the Pacific we could n't tell our families . No places , people , events . Just what we were feeling . Whenever you want to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . We 're very happy for you . " I DID N'T BECOME what I would become until maybe the second mission . I did n't develop the habits , I mean - the crazy ways of thinking , feeling , and acting that you develop when you know that if you touch someone you love , you may be giving them a disease that will kill them - until later . Those things did n't really start until after the first mission , though during that mission I 'd meet people I liked and they 'd be in the city where I needed to start the thing , and I had no choice - it was important that I start it there , in that city , if what we needed to have happen was to happen . I remember a young woman in - a mid-sized city - let 's call it Santa Livia . That 's not its real name , but I still ca n't use the real names . She was an ex-Peace Corps worker and back in the States I 'd have asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in Santa Livia working for a civilian aid organization . And that was the city where they wanted me to crack the hollow thing in my tooth to start it . All I needed to do after I cracked it was take the train from Santa Livia to the next two cities on the train route and cough a lot . It was in my bloodstream and that 's all it would take . I 'd cough , put my hand over my mouth , cough some more , touch the railings and doors of the train as I left and entered each car along the way . It was easy . You were n't sick yourself - you did n't have the symptoms - and the first time you did it you could n't believe you were starting an epidemic . How could you be starting an epidemic just by doing that ? You did n't believe it . You were just doing what they wanted you to do . When I 'd reach the third city , I 'd crack the other three fillings on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my bloodstream ; and I 'd continue on the train to - let 's call them Santo Tomas , and Santa Carolina ... and Morela . If anyone tried to track the spread of it , the " vector trail , " as they called it , would end in Morela ; but only the World Health Organization would know how totrack it and by the time they did , my train trip would be lost in the epidemic . Everyone - the cities , the government , the aid organizations - would be overwhelmed in days by the infected and no one could charge the U.S. with anything even if we got what we wanted . The disease would move from city to city within a day , and there 'd be geometric spread - the kind you get in urban areas with rats , fleas , and aerial transmission - out from those cities . I 'd be evacuated along with other non-quarantined Americans before the disease could hit the capital , where I was staying . Spreading it that way made it look natural . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have someone - a human carrier - do it - do it " by hand , " as we liked to say - in a couple of cities and then let it spread . Looking natural was important . The word you hear all the time in CIA movies - " deniability " - is true . It 's not just a Hollywood idea . That was the guiding principle . You do n't have to have it deniable in economic warfare , the way we do things now ; but you do in covert-action matters . Economic warfare - public sector and private sector both - works better anyway . She had blue eyes and she liked me , I think . I did n't know if she got out . I did n't want to know . She was in the first city and maybe that gave her a chance , unless she chose to stay - to help . With pneumonic , if it 's an untreated population , you can have ninety to one hundred percent mortality . With bubonic it tends just to be fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After doing those three cities , I took the train back to the capital and found myself not looking at women or children . If I looked at them , I felt like they were going to die , that I was going to kill them - which could have been true , but not in the way it felt at the moment . I felt that my eyes - just my eyes - could do it . If I looked at them , they 'd die . And with the women , if I thought they were beautiful , they 'd also die because I thought it - because I thought they were beautiful . Later , it would get a lot worse - the superstitions and habits - but that 's how it started , on the first mission . Not looking at women and children . Or anyone who looked at all like my parents . It started with toothbrushes , I guess . That 's when I first really noticed it . Not just averting my eyes on a train , but actual things I could touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from . I was n't supposed to do anything to draw attention to myself when I was in the field ; but after the first mission , it was like I could n't get the taste out of my mouth , so I started buying toothbrushes , one for every day ; and I 'd wrap up each one in a plastic bag at the end of the day . I started doing this when I was still in the field the second time . It was in the capital city , when all of the uninfected Americans and Europeans and Chinese and Japanese were being rushed out by jet . I used up ten toothbrushes in six days - that 's more than one a day - right before I was evacked . Back in the States , they had me live in Minneapolis . Why , I do n't know . They did n't check me in at Langley - Agency headquarters when I got back . Not at first . They put me in Walter Reed , the big military hospital in DC . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still carrying , and then I did go to Langley for debriefing , a week of it , if I remember correctly . And then finally to Minneapolis , where they wanted me low profile until they needed me again , which would n't be for another six months . I kept buying the toothbrushes - a different one , sometimes two , for each day , and eventually rubber gloves to hold them with and plastic bags to put them in . I 'd put them in the blue dumpsters behind my apartment . I wanted to bum them in a furnace , but the building did n't have one . I noticed too that I did n't touch things out in public , or where other people could touch what I 'd touched . I could have hired a maid - the Agency would have paid for it-but I would n't hire a maid . I did n't want her touching what I 'd touched in the apartment . Out in public if I touched things it would be with my left hand , the hand I never let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country again-with people I 'd grown up with and cared about - and if I was n't careful ( a voice was telling me ) , I could start it here . I know that does n't make any sense , but that 's how it felt . I was clean , completely clean , but that 's how it felt . I had no social life , even though my case agent - let 's call him Rod - kept telling me I needed one . " It 's easier in D.C. , " I 'd tell him . " There 's no social Ufe in Minneapolis . " " That 's not the reason , Matt , " he 'd say , " and you know it . " " What are you talking about ? " I 'd say , pretending I did n't know . " You 're agoraphobic and you need to work your way out of it . It happens . It 's going to happen in work like this . Do you want to see an Agency shrink ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to be in a shrink 's office where I could touch things and the shrink might die . Sometimes Rod would visit me-maybe four times while I was there , during those six months - and his visits helped . Someone who knew me and thought I was okay - despite what kind of work I did - who was n't afraid to sit near me or touch me . He was a short , squat man , and pretty gruff - a little like Joe Friday , real old school , OSS originally - but he reminded me of Professor Booth , because he also seemed to care . I 'm not sure he did-that either of them really cared - but that 's how it felt , and it helped . I certainly did n't date . I did n't have to work . I had all this free time , but I did n't socialize unless I had to . I told people in the building that I was a writer and I know they thought I was some rich kid who did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else worked . They did n't like that , which meant no one wanted to be around me-which was great . I had a different name , different social security number , the usual witness-protection kind of cover ; and everyone assumed I was a trust-fund kid , I 'm sure . I had all the time in the world , so I read a lot . When you read a lot you do n't meet a lot of people . You do n't meet a lot of girls . But there was one - her name was Trisha - she lived down the hallway - but when I thought of dating her , I saw myself sitting in my car and watching it happen . They 'd given me a car , a " 68 Mustang fastback the kind of car a trust-fund kid would have - and I saw myself sitting in it with her and , though she wanted me to kiss her , I could n't . Why ? Because if I did she 'd jerk back like she 'd been shot and I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like time-lapse photography , like a flower in a Disney nature movie blooming real fast , the buboes blooming like flowers , and then she 'd be dead . That 's what I 'd see if I thought of asking her out , but I finally did maybe because I thought I should . I knew I was going crazy and maybe it would help . She would n't die - I knew that - and seeing that she did n't die might just help . But when I did ask her , when I got off the phone after asking her out , I threw up . I threw up on the bed where I 'd made the call . I could n't stop shaking and I did n't pick her up that Saturday . I never called her again , I avoided her in the hallway , and I did n't return her call the one time she called me two weeks later . I also had a chance to see my parents during those six months and did n't . I could n't . I 'd phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that even when I was out of the field they were keeping me busy , and he 'd say , " That 's fine , Matt . I know how it goes . My good friend Gavin from the Academy was ONI and he was the busiest man I ever knew . Just hearing your voice is wonderful . Call us when you can . " Or he 'd tease me and say , " You 're not trying to avoid us , are you ? " and I 'd lie and say , " You know me better than that . " I 'd say it to my mom , too . " You know I love you both . If I 'm not going to get to see you , I want at least to call . I want you to at least hear my voice . " " You know we 're proud of you , " they 'd both say , and they 'd mean it .

Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a heart attack right after my third mission and I wanted to make it to the funeral , but I just could n't do that either . I talked to my mom for a long time on the phone , trying to explain why I could n't , inventing all sorts of things ; and though I know she believed me - I know it made her proud - I know she was disappointed . But she 'd been married to a Navy man , so she knew what sacrificing for your country was . I was sitting watching television in my apartment in Phoenix - this time they had me in Arizona - when my dad 's funeral started four hundred miles away . I remember looking at my watch every five minutes for an hour . I do n't remember what was on television . I remember hearing in my head what I would have said about him if I 'd been there .

AT FIRST THEY lieD to me and said the ex-Peace Corps woman - the woman in Santa Livia , the one I 'd liked-had made it out okay ; but two years later-after two more missions - they admitted she had n't , that she 'd been one of five Americans who 'd died in the city because the WHO 's medical shipment to the center of the epidemic took ten days , not three ; and the five were sick and so they could n't be evacuated . We 'd delayed the WHO 's shipment , of course . It was easy to do . I 'd killed her . That was the truth of it . I had n't delayed the shipment , but I 'd killed her . It was knowing that she 'd died that made me do what I did in the city of - the city of Zaquitos . I 'm sure it was . It was n't a young woman , though . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played with - a friend - in the fourth grade in Florida , when my dad was stationed there . In the next country I was sent to I saw a lot of young women who were beautiful . Maybe their arms had little nicks and scars from a hard Ufe . Maybe they were duty from the dust and heat , but they were beautiful . People are beautiful wherever they are , whether it 's war or peace or famine or floods they 're living in . But it was n't a woman I decided to save , it was a boy . I remember thinking : This is someone 's kid . You 're going to have kids some day , Matt - if you 're lucky , if you make it through this - and this is someone 's kid . He was a mescla - a mixed-blood kid at the bottom of the social ladder . His hair was kind of a bronze color , the way hair sometimes is from Brazil and the Azores . My friend in the third grade was from the Azores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my friend . His skin was dark , but he had that bronze hair and , believe it or not , a couple of freckles on his nose , too . There 'd been lot of Irish and Germans in that country in the beginning and they 'd mixed and maybe it was Irish blood coming through in this kid . He lived on a famous dump in Zaquitos - the dump I 'd gone to write a story about . I was there to write a story about how terrible conditions were for the people in that country 's north . They 'd left the droughtstricken countryside and ended up in the favelas , the slums , and that was n't any better . It was worse , in fact , and that 's what I was writing about . I was a reporter for a liberal English-language paper out of the capital city ; that 's what I was supposedly doing there . The agency had figured out how to use my writing skills and that was my - as they say - cover . I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been hired the way anyone would be . At least that 's how it looked . A paper trail in case one was needed . I was n't comfortable with the job . I did n't talk leftist jargon well enough to feel comfortable when I met other leftist journalists , but my case agent said , " Do n't worry . They ca n't fire you . " The newspaper , it turned out , was funded by the Agency . Some of the editors worked for the Agency and could pipeline agents like me , and the other editors just did n't know . That 's how it was in those days . It 's an old story now and pretty boring ; but for two missions that was my cover , and it was a good one because I got to be alone a lot of the time . I had to make myself step up close to the boy - the one I 'm talking about in the dump . Stepping up to him was hard to do because I was n't supposed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and I asked him in Spanish if I could take his picture . Some of you know Spanish , I 'm sure . I said , " iPuedo fotografiartel " and he cocked his head , and for a moment I was back in the third grade and my friend Keith was looking at me . I jumped back and nearly tripped on the garbage . I wanted to run . But in that moment I was also myself twenty years in the future looking down at my own son and feeling a love I 'd never felt before . No one , especially guys , ever feels a love like that - for children , I mean - when they 're twentytwo . It 's just not what life is like when you 're twenty-two - unless you 're a father already . But that 's what I felt and that 's what kept me from running away . There were dirty streaks on the boy 's neck from all that sweat and dirt . His ears were dirty and all he wanted to do when he saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his hand and saying in English , " Very poor ! Very poor ! " He 'd try to touch me - my camera , my sleeve and I 'd step back , shaking my head , too , because I was terrified . But I made myself do it . I gave him what I had - some coins and some bills . I was shaking like crazy because I was touching the money - touching it and then giving it to him - and as I did it I could see him dying right before me . But he did n't die , so I asked him again : " Can I photograph you ? " " Yes ! " he said , happy now , the coins and bills in his hands . " Foto ! Foto ! " He 'd gotten what he wanted and now I could snap his picture , just like any tourist would . I took his picture and went back to my hotel downtown . Even though I did n't have the roll I 'd taken at the dump processed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as I fell asleep . I dreamed about him ; and I could see his face as I woke up and got ready to go back to the dump , where I was supposed to start the " distraction " - that 's what we called it - that morning . The favelas were a logical place for it - with all the urban rats and the incredible transiency . Everyone in that country and in bordering countries and at WHO and the UN were waiting for some epidemic to start in that country . It was a time bomb . Cholera , typhoid , something . But if we-if the Agency - could get a big enough one going , there was a ninety percent chance that the government of-the government of that country - would topple . The military was ready for a coup . It had already tried once . So I stood on the dump - in all that stink and garbage - and I just could n't do it . I could n't do it with the boy there somewhere - a boy who looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid - so I went looking for him , and it took an hour , but I found him . He was with his father and brothers , and I said , " Debe llevaise a su familia ad otia ciudad - ahoia ! Cosas malas llegan ! " That meant : You 've got to move your family to another city - right now ! Bad things are coming ! They looked at me like I was crazy , so I said it again and I got out the five hundred American dollars I 'd had my department wire me . Living expenses , I 'd explained , and that was fine with them . I said in Spanish , " I want you to be safe . You need to leave this place immediately . Do the boys have a mother ? " No , she 'd died , the father said . " I will give you five hundred American dollars if you will leave today - if you will leave now ! " The father looked at me and I knew damn well what he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you . " That sends money to your country because of a television show and if it gets to you it 's a penny rather than a dollar . He was willing to take the money , but you could tell he was n't going to pack up and move-not today , maybe not ever . They had friends here , other families . You do n't give that up even for five years of income , do you ? I looked at them and waited and finally I said , " If you do n't go today , I 'll take my money back . I 'll call the police and tell them you robbed me , and I 'll take my money back . " When he got the point , when he saw I was dead serious , he led me to the shack they lived in - the cardboard and corrugated metal shack that had no running water or sewage - and helped his boys get things together . I just stood there . I could n't touch anything - anything they were going to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help them , but I could n't do that either . They 'd be insulted , and I did n't want to insult them . The boys gathered up six toy soldiers - two apiece - hammered from tin cans , a broken plastic gun and two big balls of twine , and the father gathered up four dirty blankets , a can opener that looked bent , two pairs of pants for each of them , and a bag filled with socks , shoes , plastic plates , and cups . That 's what they had . They 'd slept on the dirt floor on those blankets . I 'd never really thought of how people like this lived , and here it was . How do you live like that and not stop caring ? I do n't know . I waited for them , and when they were ready we trudged back across the refuse and smells of the dump to the first paved road , where I took the bus with them to Parelo , where they said they had family in the favela there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat in the front seat by myself , and dropped them off with the father 's sister , who did n't look happy until she saw how much money it was . The favela was n't much better than the dump , but it was two hundred miles away from where the epidemic would start , and it was a lot of money . It was a dangerous thing for me to do - being that visible - but I did n't have any choice . I knew that if I did n't do it I 'd see the boy 's face forever , like a photograph in my head . I was n't acting very normally then - I could n't touch people - I started shaking even when I thought of touching anyone - but I knew I had to try to save this one kid . If anyone was following me , they 'd wonder what the hell I was doing . That much money . A dump family . Getting them out of town and spending eleven hours on the bus with them . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a country this poor who 'd be watching me ? I was a leftist journalist and the regime was leftist . Who 'd be watching a leftist reporter ? And once the epidemic started , who 'd be free to watch me ? I was much more worried about what my case agent and his boss and the DDP would say . " You did what ? " they 'd say . How do you tell someone ? I returned to Zaquitos - which took me a day . The next morning I went back to the dump and started it . I bit down , heard the little crack , coughed into my hand , and began touching things when I got to the cemetery and crematorium , and the cars and little stores after that . I tried not to look at anyone as I did it , especially anyone old or a woman or kids . Those were the ones who bothered me most . It was hard not to look , because you wanted to know , but I 'd had a lot of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice would say to me and I would n't . The next day I took the train to the next two decent-sized cities ; and when I was through with both of them , I stopped , cracked the other fillings , went to the capital and flew back to the States before the quarantines could even get started . I kept seeing the boy 's face , sure , but it made me happy . YOU 'RE WONDERING WHY they let me talk about all of this - " top-secret your-eyes-only " kinds of things . The kinds of things that in the movies , if someone tells you , it gets you killed , right ? They let me talk not only because they 're not worried - how much damage can one guy who 's not very credible , who 's had mental problems , do ? - but also , and this is the other half of it , because it 's old news . It's-actually there in the Pentagon Papers - that old book - if you look closely enough , and it 's even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's autobiography , along with the planned use of a single-k nuclear device to end the war in Vietnam . It 's old news and I get to talk about it now because it does n't matter anymore . I guess that 's what I 'm saying . No one really cares . Vietnam does n't care whether we were planning to detonate a nuclear device to flood Hanoi - they just want favored trade status now - and those countries in South America have each had half a dozen governments since then , and they want to forget too . Ancient history . Besides , the Agency has better things to do . They 've got covert economic programs you would n't believe and designer diseases they have n't even used yet . This is the new war . The Army 's got mines that can weigh you - tell you how much you weigh - and whether you 're an adult or a child and whether you 're carrying a gun . Other mines that land and become dozens of little mobile mines that go out looking for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've got suits that , if you 're a soldier and wounded , will give you an antibiotic , or if you 're poisoned , give you the antidote , or if you 're out of water it will recycle your urine for you . You do n't have to think . The suit thinks for you . They 've got these things and they 're using them . This is what warfare is now , so how important is a guy who can break a filling in his tooth and start some plague from the Middle Ages - something that crude and messy ? That 's how they 're thinking , believe me . I did catch hell from my boss and his boss and the DDP when they found out what I 'd done with the boy . I said , " That should tell you something . It should tell you that you do n't really want me to do this for you anymore . " They actually let me quit . That surprised me . I did n't think you could quit . I 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could quit the Agency , like no one could quit the Mafia . They said they did n't really want me if my heart was n't it . But I do n't think that was the real reason . I think ii was that they just did n't need the program anymore . They were getting better programs . They made me sign papers promising for twenty-five years not to write about what I 'd done - what they 'd had me do for my country - or talk about it publicly or to anyone who 'd make it public - and then they let me leave . I had all these interpersonal problems , as I 've been saying , but I did go back to school and , I 'm proud to say , got my MBA . I wanted to get a degree I could use anywhere . I started out as a manager of a drug store , but that was because of the interpersonal problems ; and when I could finally go to company meetings and not act strange , I started moving up the ladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters , and that 's where I met my wife . It took a few more years of therapy - of Agency shrinks at the VA hospital actually - to get over it enough to really function . The toothbrushes , the not touching people you loved , the nightmares and the flashbacks - all those things I needed to work through . My wife hung in there with me throughout it all - that I 'll be forever grateful for - and we 've got two kids almost grown now , both of them boys . I do n't know where that boy from Zaquitos is now , or if he 's still alive . You do n't live long in those countries . The Luz de Mueite paramilitary units - the ones that could make you " disappear " - started up under the military regime after I did what I was sent there to do . The new government was tied to a group called The Society for Church , Family , and Tradition , and those units were operating there for ten years at least . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made it through that . Or he could have been killed for no reason . Or , if he did n't get out of the favelas , he might have died of typhus or cholera or dengue fever . You lose a lot of Third World people to those diseases even now , and they 're natural ones . I think about that boy a lot . What if someone started a plague in the U.S. , maybe at the White House in a tour group , or maybe in a big airport like LAX - to turn the tables , to " destabilize " us ? I think about that . I think of my own boys dying , no one around to save them the way I saved that boy and his brothers and father . One family 's not very much , but it 's something . That 's what I tell myself anyway . I guess that 's it . I 've gone way over my time , I know . Thanks for inviting me to speak today . It 's good to have an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people , are still interested in things like this . After all , I did what I could for you .
