Faith // Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance . If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant , if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant , then the tolerant will be destroyed , and tolerance with them . In this formulation , I do not imply , for instance , that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies ; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion , suppression would certainly be most unwise . But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force ; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument , but begin by denouncing all argument ; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument , because it is deceptive , and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols . We should therefore claim , in the name of tolerance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law , and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal , in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder , or to kidnapping , or to the revival of the slave trade , as criminal . - Karl Popper , The Open Society and Its Enemies // I grew up in a small farming town in upstate New York where my life , and the life of my family , centered on the Presbyterian Church . I prayed and sang hymns every Sunday , went to Bible school , listened to my father preach the weekly sermon and attended seminary at Harvard Divinity School to be a preacher myself . America was a place where things could be better if we worked to make them better , and where our faith saved us from despair , self-righteousness and the dangerous belief that we knew the will of God or could carry it out . We were taught that those who claimed to speak for God , the self-appointed prophets who promised the Kingdom of God on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand God 's will . We did the best we could . We trusted and had faith in the mystery , the unknown before us . We made decisions - even decisions that on the outside looked unobjectionably moral - well aware of the numerous motives , some good and some bad , that went into every human act . In the end , we all stood in need of forgiveness . We were all tainted by sin . None were pure . The Bible was not the literal word of God . It was not a self-help manual that could predict the future . It did not tell us how to vote or allow us to divide the world into us and them , the righteous and the damned , the infidels and the blessed . It was a book written by a series of ancient writers , certainly fallible and at times at odds with each other , who asked the right questions and struggled with the mystery and transcendence of human existence . We took the Bible seriously and therefore could not take it literally . // There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , my father railed against the Glass Bar , the one bar in town , and the drinking in the VFW Hall . We did not work on Sunday . I never heard my father swear . But coupled with this piety was a belief that as Christians we were called to fight for justice . My father took an early stand in the town in support of the civil-rights movement , a position that was highly unpopular in rural , white enclaves where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . was one of the most hated men in America . A veteran of World War II , he opposed the Vietnam War , telling me when I was about 12 that if the war was still being waged when I was 18 , he would go to prison with me . To this day I carry in my head the rather gloomy image of sitting in a jail cell with my dad . Finally , because his youngest brother was gay , he understood the pain and isolation of being a gay man in America . He worked later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordination and marriage of gays . When he found that my college , Colgate University , had no gay and lesbian organization , he brought gay speakers to the campus . The meetings led gays and lesbians to confide in him that they felt uncomfortable coming out of the closet to start an open organization , a problem my father swiftly solved by taking me out to lunch and informing me that although I was not gay , I had to form the organization . When I went into the dining hall for breakfast , lunch and dinner , the checker behind the desk would take my card , mark off the appropriate box , and hand it back , muttering , " Faggot . " This willingness to take a moral stand , to accept risk and ridicule , was , he showed me , the cost of the moral life . // The four Gospels , we understood , were filled with factual contradictions , two Gospels saying Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist , while Luke asserted that John was already in prison . Mark and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew and Luke give differing accounts . There are three separate and different versions of the 10 Commandments ( Exodus 20 , Exodus 34 , and Deuteronomy 5 ) . As for the question of God 's true nature , there are many substantive contradictions . Is God a loving or a vengeful God ? In some sections of the Bible , vicious acts of vengeance , including the genocidal extermination of opposing tribes and nations , appear to be blessed by God . God turns on the Egyptians and transforms the Nile into blood so the Egyptians will suffer from thirst - and then sends swarms of locusts and flies to torture them , along with hail , fire and thunder from the heavens to destroy all plants and trees . To liberate the children of Israel , God orders the firstborn in every Egyptian household killed so all will know " that the Lord makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel " ( Exodus 11:7 ) . The killing does not cease until " there was not a house where one was not dead " ( Exodus 12:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the clothing , jewelry , gold and silver from the Egyptian homes ( Exodus 12:35-36 ) . God looks at the devastation and says , " I have made sport of the Egyptians " ( Exodus 10:2 ) . While the Exodus story fueled the hopes and dreams of oppressed Jews , and later African Americans in the bondage of slavery , it also has been used to foster religious chauvinism. // A literal reading of the Bible means reinstitution of slavery coupled with the understanding that the slavemaster has the right to beat his slave without mercy since " the slave is his money " ( Exodus 21:21 ) . Children who strike or curse a parent are to be executed ( Exodus 21:15 , 17 ) . Those who pay homage to another god " shall be utterly destroyed " ( Exodus 22:20 ) . Menstruating women are to be considered unclean , and all they touch while menstruating becomes unclean ( Leviticus 15:19-32 ) .

Blasphemers shall be executed ( Leviticus 24:16 ) . And " if the spirit of jealousy " comes upon a man , the high priest can order the jealous man 's wife to drink the " water of bitterness . " If she dies , it is proof of her guilt ; if she survives , of her innocence ( Numbers 5:11-31 ) . Women , throughout the Bible , are subservient to men , often without legal rights , and men are free to sell their daughters into sexual bondage ( Exodus 21:7-11 ) . // Hatred of Jews and other non-Christians pervades the Gospel of John ( 3:18-20 ) . Jews , he wrote , are children of the devil , the father of lies ( John 8:39-44 ) . Jesus calls on his followers to love their enemies and to pray for their persecutors ( Matthew 5:44 ) , a radical concept in the days of the Roman Empire . He says we must never demean or insult our enemies . But then we read of Jesus calling his enemies " a brood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Revelation , a crucial text for the radical Christian Right , appears to show Christ returning to earth at the head of an avenging army . It is one of the few places in the Bible where Christ is associated with violence . This bizarre book , omitted from some of the early canons and relegated to the back of the Bible by Martin Luther , may have been a way , as scholars contend , for the early Christians to cope with Roman persecution and their dreams of final triumph and glory . The book , however , paints a picture of a bloody battle between the forces of good and evil , Christ and the Antichrist , God and Satan , and the torment and utter destruction of all who do not follow the faith . In this vision , only the faithful will be allowed to enter the gates of the New Jerusalem . All others will disappear , cast into the lake of fire ( Revelation 20:14-15 ) .

It is a story of God 's ruthless , terrifying and violent power unleashed on nonbelievers : // The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun , and it was allowed to scorch men with fire ; men were scorched by the fierce heat , and they cursed the name of God , who had power over these plagues , and they did not repent and give him glory . The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast , and its kingdom was in darkness ; men gnawed their tongues in anguish and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores , and did not repent of their deeds . ( Revelation 16:8-11 ) // There is enough hatred , bigotry and lust for violence in the pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . Religion , as H. Richard Niebuhr said , is a good thing for good people and a bad thing for bad people . And the Bible has long been used in the wrong hands - such as antebellum slave owners in the American South who quoted from it to defend slavery - not to Christianize the culture , as those wielding it often claim , but to acculturate the Christian faith . // Many of the suppositions of the biblical writers , who understood little about the working of the cosmos or the human body , are so fanciful , and the accounts so wild , that even biblical literalists reject them . God is not , as many writers of the Bible believed , peering down at us through little peepholes in the sky called stars . These evangelicals and fundamentalists are , as the Reverend William Sloane Coffin wrote , not biblical literalists , as they claim , but " selective literalists , " choosing the bits and pieces of the Bible that conform to their ideology and ignoring , distorting or inventing the rest . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either the Bible is literally true and all of its edicts must be obeyed , or it must be read in another way . // Mainstream Christians can also cherry-pick the Bible to create a Jesus and God who are always loving and compassionate . Such Christians often fail to acknowledge that there are hateful passages in the Bible that give sacred authority to the rage , self-aggrandizement and intolerance of the Christian Right . Church leaders must denounce the biblical passages that champion apocalyptic violence and hateful political creeds . They must do so in the light of other biblical passages that teach a compassion and tolerance , often exemplified in the life of Christ , which stands opposed to bigotry and violence . Until this happens , until the Christian churches wade into the debate , these biblical passages will be used by bigots and despots to give sacred authority to their calls to subjugate or eradicate the enemies of God . This literature in the biblical canon keeps alive the virus of hatred , whether dormant or active , and the possibility of apocalyptic terror in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge the canonical authority of these passages means these churches share some of the blame . " Unless the churches , Protestant and Catholic alike , come together on this , they will continue to make it legitimate to believe in the end as a time when there will be no non-Christians or infidels , " theologian Richard Fenn wrote . " Silent complicity with apocalyptic rhetoric soon becomes collusion with plans for religiously inspired genocide. " // As long as scripture , blessed and accepted by the church , teaches that at the end of time there will be a Day of Wrath and Christians will control the shattered remnants of a world cleansed through violence and war , as long as it teaches that all nonbelievers will be tormented , destroyed and banished to hell , it will be hard to thwart the message of radical apocalyptic preachers or assuage the fears of the Islamic world that Christians are calling for its annihilation . Those who embrace this dark conclusion to life can find it endorsed in scripture , whether it is tucked into the back pew rack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida . The mainstream Protestant and Catholic churches , declining in numbers and influence , can not hope to combat the hysteria and excitement roused by these prophets of doom until they repudiate the apocalyptic writings in scripture . // The writers of Genesis , as the Reverend William Sloane Coffin has pointed out , who wrote about the creation of the world in seven days , knew nothing about the process of creation . They believed the earth was flat with water above and below it . They wrote that God created light on the first day and the sun on the fourth day . Genesis was not written to explain the process of creation , of which these writers knew nothing . It was written to help explain the purpose of creation . It was written to help us grasp a spiritual truth , not a scientific or historical fact . And this purpose , this spiritual truth , is something the writers did know about . These biblical writers , at their best , understood our divided natures . They knew our internal conflicts and battles ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oppressive power of parents , even the best of parents ; the impulses that drive us to commit violations against others ; the yearning to lead a life of meaning ; our fear of mortality ; our struggles to deal with our uncertainty , our loneliness , our greed , our lust , our ambition , our desires to be God , as well as our moments of nobility , compassion and courage . They knew these emotions and feelings were entangled . They understood our weaknesses and strengths . They understood how we are often not the people we want to be or know we should be , how hard it is for us to articulate all this , and how life and creation can be as glorious and beautiful as it can be mysterious , evil and cruel . This is why Genesis is worth reading , indeed why the Bible stands as one of the great ethical and moral documents of our age . The biblical writers have helped shape and define Western civilization . Not to know the Bible is , in some ways , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , art , architecture , literature , poetry and music . It is to fall into a dangerous provincialism , as myopic and narrow as that embraced by those who say everything in the Bible is literally true and we do not need any other kind of intellectual or scientific inquiry . Doubt and belief are not , as biblical literalists claim , incompatible . Those who act without any doubt are frightening . // " There lives more faith in honest doubt , " the poet Alfred Tennyson noted , " believe me , than in half the creeds. " // This was my faith . It is a pretty good summary of my faith today . God is inscrutable , mysterious and unknowable . We do not understand what life is about , what it means , why we are here and what will happen to us after our brief sojourn on the planet ends . We are saved , in the end , by faith - faith that life is not meaningless and random , that there is a purpose to human existence , and that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant acts of compassion and blind human kindness , especially to those labeled our enemies and strangers , sustain the divine spark , which is love . We are not fully human if we live alone . These small acts of compassion - for they can never be organized and institutionalized as can hate - have a power that lives after us . Human kindness is deeply subversive to totalitarian creeds , which seek to thwart all compassion toward those deemed unworthy of moral consideration , those branded as internal or external enemies . These acts recognize and affirm the humanity of others , others who may be condemned as agents of Satan . Those who sacrifice for others , especially at great cost , who place compassion and tolerance above ideology and creeds , and who reject absolutes , especially moral absolutes , stand as constant witnesses in our lives to this love , even long after they are gone . In the gospels this is called resurrection . //
