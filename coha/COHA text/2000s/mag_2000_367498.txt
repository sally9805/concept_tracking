No matter what George Curry accomplishes during the remainder of his journalistic career , he will be remembered for one thing : he was the editor who slapped a portrait of Clarence Thomas wearing an Aunt Jemima-style handkerchief on a 1993 cover of Emerge magazine . That shocking image outraged Thomas ' supporters , of course , but it crystallized the disgust that many African Americans had begun to feel about the ultraconservative legal philosophy of the U.S. Supreme Court 's only black member . It also put Emerge on the map . " It let people know there was nothing and no one we were afraid to take on , " says Curry . " A lot of people in the black community say we should n't air our dirty laundry in public . I say , ' Give me your dirty laundry . ' If Emerge , an African-American newsmagazine , ca n't critique black leaders , who can ? " <P> That 's the uncompromising voice that made Emerge the nation 's best black newsmagazine for the past seven years . Ferociously militant . Deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearly devoid of humor . The kind of magazine that nearly always left you angrier at white people than you were before you read it . The problem ? It came on way too strong for many of its intended readers , not to mention white advertisers . <P> Last week the magazine 's new managers , New York City-based Vanguarde Media Inc. , halted publication and fired most of the staff , including Curry . Despite the booming economy and the affluence of the black middle class , Emerge 's circulation was stuck at 160,000 , one-tenth the size of Ebony 's . It had been losing $1 million a year . Says Roy Johnson , editorial director of Vanguarde , which in April became joint owner of Emerge in a complex deal with BET Holdings II Inc. : " From a business standpoint , suspending publication was an easy call . As a new company , we simply could not afford to carry a magazine that was trending downward like that . " <P> Johnson , a former editor at Time Inc. , where Emerge got its start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerge failed because " it did n't strike the right chord with its readers . " By that , he clearly means that Curry 's bristling brand of journalism is no longer marketable to a black bourgeois audience that wants to be entertained , not browbeaten . The new , as yet unnamed , magazine that Vanguarde will bring out next year to take Emerge 's place , says Johnson , will be " a black Vanity Fair . Our hope is to create an editorial product that is smart , provocative , stylish and inviting . " It wo n't be a magazine that puts Farrakhan on the cover , much less Clarence Thomas in a do-rag . <P> So where does that leave Curry , who was sworn in as the first black president of the American Society of Magazine Editors only a few weeks before Emerge shut down ? Trying to persuade investors to bankroll a new magazine that would follow in Emerge 's footsteps . He maintains that Emerge could have doubled its circulation if it had been more aggressively promoted . " There 's a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " insists Curry . " Our people still need a magazine like Emerge . " Perhaps so , but will enough of them buy it ?
