// THIRTY minutes . That 's how long it took for Missy Elliott and Eve  --  hip-hop 's hottest females  --  to show and prove that they have indeed taken rap to a new level . The two were in a Miami photo studio for their first  --  ever photo shoot together  --  and amazingly , the first flash went off only a half-hour late . In the world of hip-hop  --  where no one is ever on time for anything , where it is expected that even the two-bittiest of rhymers will show up for a shoot two hours late , and waste two more hours complaining to their entourage about the lighting , the temperature , the clothing , the hair , the makeup , the color scheme  --  the mere fact that two of rap 's most sought-after ladies were on time and ready to work was evidence that a new day has dawned . The two seemed at ease together as they posed for photo after photo . Eve had lent her vocals to a song on Missy latest CD , Miss E ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed . They laughed and joked with each other as each talked about the hectic schedule that lies ahead for them . Missy was in the midst of traveling cross-country to promote her CD , while Eve was about to begin a grueling concert tour . During the past five years , Missy and Eve not only have sold more CDs than any other female hip-hop artists , but perhaps have done more than anyone else in the industry to wring the rank out of rap , to bring new respectability to the oft-maligned female purveyors of the art form who have had an identity crisis ever since the first Sister picked up a microphone . They have brought new beats and new rhythms , new flows and new subjects to rap , selling innovative music without selling their soul . They will never rap about violence . Never pimp themselves for platinum status . Never put their business in the street to make headlines . They have aligned themselves with the right people , and have schooled themselves in fashion , etiquette , and protocol . They are streetwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their earnings in safe investments , and opportunistically pursued other areas such as management , acting and modeling . They are complex divas and simple homegirls , hard and soft , all at the same time . Photograph Popular rap artists Eve ( left ) and Missy Elliott ( above ) , are among hip-hop 's hottest female performers , and they might have done more than anyone else to bring a new level of respectability to female rappers. // They are recognized in the inner-city as well as the suburbs , and respected throughout music circles . Rocker Mick Jagger even thought so much of Missy that he asked her to work with him on his upcoming solo album . " I kind of remain in a category of my own , " says Missy , whose current CD sold 250,000 copies ( or 1,500 every hour of every day ) in the first week of release . " I 'm not a follower . I 'm not a copycat . I 'm an original . That 's important to staying around for a long time . I continuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something different from me every time . " While music is a passion for both ladies , it is also a career to these women , a business that must be approached in a professional manner . They do n't travel with large entourages , yes-men and yes  --  women who pander to their every whim . If they want something , they 'd just as soon get it for themselves . If they want to make a phone call , they do it themselves . " I love the work , " Eve says . " There are days when I wake up and I 'm tired . But I love being tired . Just because I 'm working . Just because I know where I could be . I have a beautiful life . " In the process , they have written new rules , redefined what it takes for a woman to make it in the world of hip-hop . " Females bring style , image to rap , " Missy says . " Guys pretty much can be in some jeans and say whatever they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of young female teenagers who look up to us and want to be sassy like we are . " Photograph Out of the spotlight , Eve pours a fruit drink for her manager , Troy Carter . The 22-year-old star says she 's " tough and soft , " and her personality is influenced by her surroundings . // Just like other ladies in hip-hop , the two say they have been told time and time again that female rappers have to be nasty rough  --  necks to make it in rap . But they refused to believe that a woman rapper has to dress half-naked and use sex as a gimmick to sell CDs . And while they can get down-and  --  dirty at times , on recordings and onstage , they have been successful in using sexuality and hard language naturally , in a way that their female fans can relate to . " The hardest thing about being a female rapper is proving yourself , " says Missy , who worked as a songwriter and producer before hitting the music scene in 1997 with Supa Dupa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real World . " This is a male-dominated field and you get male rappers all day long . But there are only a few females who will be a household name . Being accepted by the guys , who think you are hot and respect your talent , is important . " Eve agrees , adding that she has n't experienced any blatant disrespect because she is a female , but the subtle things are there every day . " Just because it 's a male  --  dominated field , I have had to work twice as hard as the men , " says the 22-year-old Philadelphia native , who sold 2 million copies of her 1999 debut , Let There be Eve : Ruff Ryder 's First Lady , and watched her new CD , Scorpion , spend weeks at No. 1 . " People look at you , especially when you look decent , and say things like , You 're kind of hot . Can I take you out ? ' it 's not like that . I stand my ground . I 'm like , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , respect my work , or leave me alone . ' ' " Troy Carter , Eve 's manager , says Eve has been so successful because , " She 's like that cool girl who lives down the street from you . The one you can talk to , relate to , but at the same time , she has that cuteness and sexiness about her . She can either hang with the dogs or hang with the girls . It 's something that 's natural , " he says . " A lot of female artists who have come out have been fabricated . They have men writing for them , men who are producing for them . She thinks for herself . She 's speaking for the average 22-year-old woman . " Both keep their romantic relationships with men low key . Eve was once dating music producer Stevie J. , but offered a " no comment " when asked about the status of their relationship now . Missy , on the other hand , says while she " needs a man " she does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both take pride in their public image , and work hard to keep it positive , always thinking about how they can improve on the way their fans perceive them . Missy , for instance , is working to show her fans that she is not all about business and making money , that she also has a fun , kid-at-heart side , a side that loves to go to amusement parks , laugh and joke . Eve , on the other hand , hopes to disprove the notion that she 's all about high-fashion and big spending , and that her short stint as a stripper is something in her past that 's not worth even discussing now . " I stripped ; so what ! " she says . " I 'm doing better for myself now , and that 's all that matters . " While the two say they can be hard at times , as evidenced by the parental-warning labels on each of their CDs , both say they are mostly soft ladies who like the same things most women like . " I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , you see a whole other side . That 's the b  --  side , " Missy says . " Other than that , I 'm very sweet . The majority of the time , I 'm smiling , laughing , in a good mood . " " I 'm both tough and soft , " says Eve , whose real name is Eve Jihan Jeffers and who says her toughness comes from her mother . " It depends on the situation , people , events . I 'm sensitive only around certain people . Only certain people have seen me cry . I 'm usually tough when I 'm out of my immediate circle . " Eve started rapping when she was 12 and stuck with it " because of the attention that it got me from people looking at me , watching me , wanting to know what I had to say , " she says . " When I started rapping , I liked the attention . I did n't know about all of this . " She first dyed her hair blond when she was 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the bright red that it is today . Eve got her first tattoo  --  the paw prints on her chest-from a guy named Eddie when she was 18 . " It 's one of my favorite things , " she says . She now has three tattoos and plans to get more . Photograph A young Missy Elliott ( right ) has evolved ( above ) into one of rap 's most outspoken contributors . // Eve says she did n't like high school , and was sure she would n't like college . " Music was what I really wanted to do , " says Eve , who now lives in New Jersey . " I told myself if I did n't get a deal before I was 20 , 1 was going to quit rapping . I got a deal when I was 19 . So I think it was meant to be . " Her music deal came after a meeting in Los Angeles with Dr. Dre , who moved her to the West Coast to work with him in the studio . However , after eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show for her time in L.A. But it did n't take long for her to bounce back . A few months later , she became the first lady to sign with Ruff Ryders . Missy , an only child , also has fond memories of growing up . " I remember always being into music , " says the Portsmouth , Va. , native . " When I was 4 , I used to sing to my doll babies . They had rotating arms , I used to lift them up and pretend that they were clapping for me . I had a wild imagination . I think that continues now . When I got home from school , I was n't thinking about homework , I was thinking about putting on a Michael Jackson record and getting in the mirror and imitating him . I had a Jheri Curl and everything . " One memory that still haunts Missy to this day is the breakup of her parents . When she was 13 , her mother left her father after what Missy says was years of physical abuse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " It made me a stronger person . Just watching her and picking up her ways . " Missy 's music career began in 1991 when she auditioned as a member of the group , Sista , for Devate Swing of Jodeci . The group never took off , but Missy excelled at songwriting and producing for such artists as Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey . She received a recording contract of her own in 1996 , and  --  with superproducer Timothy ( Timbaland ) Mosely in tow  --  has n't looked back . Through it all , both Missy and Eve have had to endure the pressure that comes along with being females in the rap music industry . For Eve , the pressure , at one point , became too much for her to handle . " I went into a depression , " she says . " It was for a couple of months , but I do n't ever want to go through that again . It was after my first album . I think everything was just so overwhelming for me . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , people , lawyers , contracts , budgets , everything . Just so much . I was 21 . And there was nobody who I felt like I could really talk to , who really understood what I was going through . I was going through a growth process , definitely changing from a young woman to a woman . There was just a lot going on with me . I was confused about a lot of things . I just crashed . I got out of it by talking to myself . I cried a lot . I prayed a lot . It was crazy . I do n't ever want to go through that again , but I 'm glad it happened . I learned from it . " Eve believes the biggest mistake artists make is not being themselves . " You have to always stick with what made you big , " she says . " There is nothing wrong with growing . But do n't do something that is not you . That 's a really big mistake , and that 's something that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what . I do n't care where I am . I have to be Eve . I grow every day . I grow every second . I call myself a chameleon . I 'm changing all the time . But I 'm still Eve . Whatever 's in my heart and my mind , whatever my first instinct is , whatever feels right for me , that 's what I do . If I do that , I 'll be okay . " Missy thinks the biggest mistake artists make is not investing their money . " If I do n't make another dollar ( because of my investments ) , I can continue my lifestyle , " she says . " It 's so materialistic in this game that when you get that money , we as entertainers , want to have the nice car , want to have the nice jewelry , you want to live big . But what we do n't understand is that the way you live big is to live like that for a long time . You 're not going to be hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " But while the two have dreamed of stardom all of their lives , never in their wildest dream  --  and their best-laid plans  --  did either woman expect their lives to turn out the way that they have . " I 'm blessed , Eve says . " I never thought my career would get as far as it has . I know I have a lot more to do . It 's amazing to me . It 's definitely not like I thought . Everybody has their picture of the business before they get into the business . I thought it was going to be partying , having fun , me and my girlfriends . It 's nothing like that . This is a business . For real . You have to have a passion for it or you ca n't do it . " Missy says that she sometimes has to pinch herself to make sure her life is not a dream . " When I see my mom happy , that motivates me , " she says . " I bought her a 20,000-square foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being able to give her a check for $100,000 , that feels good ! You have to sit sometimes by yourself and remember when you used to be the person riding on the bus , when you used to be the person with no car , " she says , " to now , when everything has changed , from bus to limo , from $5 to $500,000 , from Cup O ' Noodles to Mr. Chops restaurant . " However , she admits that she still eats Cup O ' Noodles . But now she only does it when she 's on the run and has to be somewhere on time , like a photo shoot , because whether you call Missy and Eve rough or sweet , tough or soft , there 's one thing you ca n't call them  --  late .

The two hip-hop stars ( below ) have sold more CDs than any other female rappers during the past five years . And they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
