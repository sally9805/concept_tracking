<p> I HAVE a photograph of the guns he packed . Apparently , it is true that a rifle is a marine 's best friend . Greg will travel , indeed sleep , with his weapons . My husband snapped the photo and e-mailed it from North Carolina , right after he put Greg on the bus that took him to the airstrip where he began his journey to Iraq . <p> We are 48 hours into a 210-day tour . I write " we , " though it is Greg , our 19-year-old son , who will actually serve the time . And I include myself in the equation , although I am not related to Greg by blood , having met and married his father only six years ago . <p> Each soldier is limited to a knapsack and two sea bags  --  what civilians would call duffels . Space is tight . Once Greg packed his firearms , there was hardly room for any of the other paraphernalia that might make seven months in Iraq bearable , assuming that such a thing is possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident that he made room for his iPod . " I would lose my mind without it , " he told me during his last visit home . " What makes you think you wo n't lose your mind anyway ? " I wanted to ask . But that is exactly the kind of thing I can never say . <p> My husband reports that Greg took a stack of DVDs to play on his laptop , another piece of electronic equipment that he presumably managed to cram into his bags . But I have few details . I do not know , for example , whether he chose comedies or combat films to while away the downtime , if such a thing exists . <p> And I know precious little about what else he stuffed into his bags . Just as well , I think . It would be all too reminiscent of Tim O'Brien 's " The Things They Carried , " a book that I picked up and then put down somewhere around Page 10 . Right after the nervous guy who carried the tranquilizers took a bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it , we 'll know soon enough what he carried . Do n't they send the stuff home ? <p> Sometimes , however , curiosity gets the better of me . And then I wonder if the three items I sent made the cut . <p> Choosing those articles was tricky . What do you give to a young man who has decided to put himself in harm 's way ? It must be small , it must be light , and it must be thoughtful . And because I am only his stepmother , it can not be overly sentimental . Technically speaking , I do not have a place card at this party . I would be wise to tread lightly . So I opt for a prayer , a book and a journal , which , in a lighter moment , my husband predicts will come home still encased in its shrink wrap . I accept the teasing with good humor , and laugh . That 's O.K. , as long as Greg does n't come home wrapped in anything . <p> At Christmas , Greg casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb Mount Everest . " Sounds like a good plan , " my husband replied . Sounds like another ridiculously dangerous decision . <p> But I keep quiet , switch lenses , and focus on my stepson 's optimism and on his unspoken assumption that he will come home in one piece . Healthy enough to undertake such an arduous expedition . And that premise makes selecting a book easy . <p> " Great choice , " says the cashier at the bookstore , when I plunk down a paperback copy of Jon Krakauer 's " Into Thin Air . " <p> But Ari , my 17-year-old daughter , is cautious . " Do they all make it ? " she asks , examining the book jacket . <p> " Of course , " I answer . <p> But later , I am not so sure . After the book is gift-wrapped , and it 's too late to retrieve it from my husband 's luggage , I suddenly recall the image of empty oxygen bottles and frozen corpses littering the path to the summit . But then , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad behavior and stupid decisions  --  begins to rationalize : " Oh , well , better that he knows the risks up front . Besides , it 's a page-turner . It will help to kill time in Iraq . " Assuming of course , that Iraq does n't kill him . <p> The prayer I pick is neither Christian , Jewish nor Muslim . Perfect for a member of this hodgepodge of a family , a patchwork of people , faiths and traditions . It is an old Celtic blessing , famous for its entreaty for the safekeeping of a loved one . An ideal choice . If anyone needs to be held in the hollow of God 's hand , then it is this sweet boy , who by some combination of fate and ill luck has pulled the short straw . The one that requires him to man the machine gun in the Humvee . Is n't that the most dangerous job ? Do they know that he is 6-foot-4 ? How will he be able to keep his head down ? But that is exactly the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I type and retype the prayer , playing with the format and font until it is the size of a small card . Tiny enough to fit in a pocket  --  or hold in a private moment of panic . And then , at the last minute , I decide to laminate the slip of paper . I remember how my children loved that wonder film when they were young . How they coated everything they could lay their hands on . I still carry their shiny library cards in my wallet , tangible proof of their enthusiasm and wobbly beginner signatures . So I dig out the roll of plastic from the closet . This way , it wo n't get torn . And he can still read the prayer if it gets wet , in case anybody spills anything on it . " Like blood , " a scary voice whispers . <p> By now , Greg is halfway around the world . Most likely in Kuwait , cooling his heels and waiting for transport to the real action . Already , he is lucky not to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one I read about in the morning while I sipped my coffee  --  and did not mention to my husband . <p> But my efforts to shield my spouse proved futile . Of course he spotted that headline . How could he miss it ? We are now on red alert . No detail about Iraq goes unnoticed . We listen to the evening news like bloodhounds , thirsty for the scent of our beloved son . <p> " Do n't worry , " I tell my husband . " Bad news travels on wings . We will know soon enough if there is a problem . " <p> But silently , I worry . What if I am wrong ? What if , in our upper-middle-class complacency , we assume the best and suffer the worst ? What if the death notification squad arrives late , after we have read the newspaper ? How will we bear it ? But that is exactly the kind of thing I can never say . <p> Two hundred and eight days to go. ##
