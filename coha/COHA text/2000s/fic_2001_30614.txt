On what had begun as just another June day in Manhattan , Susanne Seebring Malloy returned to her Upper East Side brownstone after lunch with friends to find a saffron yellow envelope in the mail . She knew it was from her mother , even without the vineyard logo in the upper left corner or her mother 's elegant script in the address . Between the Asquonset , Rhode Island , postmark and the scent of Natalie 's trademark freesia , there was no doubt at all . Susanne stepped out of her Ferragamos and curled her toes in dismay . A letter from her mother was the last thing she needed . She would look at it later . She was feeling hollow enough as it was . And whose fault was that ? she asked herself , irrationally annoyed . It was Natalie 's fault . Natalie had lived her life by the book , doing everything just so . She had been the most dutiful wife Susanne had ever seen and she had been Susanne 's role model . So Susanne had become a dutiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken hold , she was so busy catering to Mark and the kids that she did n't have time for a career . Now the children were grown and resented her intrusion , and Mark had staff to do the small things she used to do . She still traveled with him sometimes , but though he claimed to love having her along , he did n't truly need her there . She was window dressing . Nothing more . She had time for a career now . She had the energy . But she was fifty-six , for goodness sake . Fifty-six was a little old to be starting a career . So where did that leave her ? she wondered , discouraged now as she took the new catalogues from the mail and settled into a chair by the window overlooking the courtyard . It left her with Neiman Marcus , Blooming-dale 's , Hammacher Schlemmer , and a sense that somehow , somewhere , she had missed the boat . She should ask her mother about that , she thought dryly as if Natalie would sympathize with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Natalie did n't discuss problems . She discussed clothing . She discussed wallpaper . She discussed bread-and-butter letters on engraved stationery . She was an expert on manners . So was Susanne . But she was fed up with those things . They were dull . They were petty . They were as irrelevant as the bouillabaisse she had cooked yesterday before remembering that Mark had a dinner meeting , or the cache of hors d'oeuvres and pastries she had prepared in the past six months and frozen for the guests who never came anymore and speaking of food , if Natalie was sending her the menu for the vineyard 's Fall Harvest Feast , Susanne would scream . Ripe for a fight , she pushed herself out of the chair and retrieved the yellow envelope from the hall table . Mail from her mother was common . Natalie was forever sending copies of reviews of one Asquonset wine or another , and if not a review , then a personal letter of praise from a vintner in California or France though Susanne was n't interested in any of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not hers . She had spent decades trying to convince them of that . Lobbying efforts to get her involved , like most else in her life , had grown old . But this envelope was different . It was of the same heavy stock that Natalie favored , but its color deep yellow with dark blue ink was a far cry from the classic ivory with burgundy ink of usual Asquonset mailings . And it was n't addressed to Susanne alone . It was addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Mark Malloy in a calligrapher 's script that , too , was a deviation from Asquonset style . Uneasy , Susanne held the envelope for a moment , thinking that something had been going on with Natalie the last few times they talked . Her words had been optimistic ones , focusing on how Asquonset was recovering from Alexander 's death , but she had seemed ... troubled . More than once , Susanne sensed there was something Natalie was n't saying , and since Susanne did n't want to be involved in vineyard business , she did n't prod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mourning process . Suddenly , now , she wondered if there was a connection between this envelope and that tension . Opening the flap , she pulled a matching yellow card from inside . PLEASE JOIN US FOR A CELEBRATION OF OUR WEDDING LABOR DAY SUNDAY AT 4 P.M. THE GREAT HOUSE ASQUONSET VINEYARD AND WINERY NATALIE SEEBRING AND CARL BURKE Susanne frowned . She read the words again . Wedding ? Stunned , she read the invitation a third time , but the words did n't change . Natalie remarrying ? It did n't make sense . Natalie marrying Carl ? That made even less sense . Carl Burke had been the vineyard manager for thirty-five years . He was an employee , an earthy man of meager means , nowhere near on a par with Alexander Seebring Susanne 's father Natalie 's husband of fifty-eight years , dead barely six months . Oh yes . Susanne knew that Carl had been a big help to Natalie in the last few months . Natalie mentioned him often more often of late . But talking about the man was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a joke ? Not likely . Even if Natalie were a comic , which she was n't , she would n't do anything as tasteless as this . Susanne turned the card over , looking for a word of explanation from her mother , but there was none . Reading the words a fourth time , having no choice but to take them as real , she was deeply hurt . Mothers did n't do things like this , she told herself . They did n't break momentous news to their daughters in a formal invitation not unless they were estranged , and Natalie and Susanne were n't . They talked on the phone once a week . They saw each other every month or so . Granted , they did n't confide in each other . That was n't the nature of their relationship . But even in spite of that , it did n't make sense to Susanne that Natalie would n't have forewarned her about Carl unless Natalie had forewarned her , in her own evasive way , through those frequent mentions of Carl . Perhaps Susanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of a wedding . There had n't been one . For all outward purposes , Natalie was still in mourning . Susanne read the invitation a final time . Still stunned , still disbelieving , she picked up the phone . In the foyer of a small brick Colonial in Washington , D.C. 's , Woodley Park , a yellow envelope identical to the one his sister had received lay in the heap on the floor under the mail slot when Greg Seebring arrived home that same afternoon . He did n't see it at first . All he saw was the heap itself , which was far too big to represent a single day 's mail . He had been gone for three . He guessed he was looking at mail from all three , but where was his wife ? " Jill ? " he called . Loosening his tie , he went looking . She was n't in the living room , kitchen , or den . He went up the stairs , but the two bedrooms there were empty , too . Confused , he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she had anything planned . If so , she had n't told him . Not that they 'd talked during his trip . He 'd been on the go the whole time , leaving the hotel early and returning late , too talked out to pick up the phone . He had felt really good about catching an early plane home . He had thought she would be pleased . Pleased , indeed . She was n't even here . He should have called . But hell , she had n't called him , either . Feeling suddenly exhausted , he went down the stairs for his bag . As soon as he lifted it , though , he set it back down and , taking only his laptop , scooped up the mail . Again , it seemed like too much . He wondered if Jill had gone to see her mother . She had been considering that for a while . Dumping the lot on the kitchen counter , he hooked the laptop to the phone and booted it up . While he waited , he pushed junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained was identifiable by a return address . There was an envelope from the Committee to Elect Michael Bonner , a friend of his who was running for the U.S. Senate and surely wanted money . There was one from a college friend of Jill 's , and another postmarked Akron , Ohio , where Jill 's mother lived , perhaps mailed before Jill had decided to visit . There was one with a more familiar postmark and an even more familiar scent . Lifting the yellow envelope , he pictured his mother . Strong . Gracious . Daffodil-bright , if aloof . But the vineyard colors were ivory with burgundy . She always used them . Asquonset was her identity . The envelope had the weight of an invitation . No surprise there ; partying was Natalie 's specialty . But then , Alexander Seebring had loved a big bash , and who could begrudge him ? No gentleman farmer , this man . Many a day he had walked the vineyard in his jeans and denim shirt alongside his manager . If not that , he was traveling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off . After years of struggle , he had Asquonset turning a tidy profit . He had earned the right to party . Natalie knew how to oblige . She was in her element directing caterers , florists , and musicians . There had always been two festivals at Asquonset each year one to welcome spring , one to celebrate the harvest . The spring party had been skipped this year , coming as it would have so soon after Al 's death . Apparently , though , Natalie was chafing at the bit . She hated wearing black did n't have a single black dress in her wardrobe , had actually had to go out and buy one for the funeral . So , barely six months later , she was returning to form . Greg was n't sure he approved . It seemed wrong , what with her husband of so many years his father still fresh in his grave , and the future of Asquonset up in the air . Natalie wanted Greg to run it . She had n't said that in as many words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No way . Out of the question . He wondered if she had found a buyer wondered , suddenly , whether this party was to introduce whoever it was . But she would have told him first . Then again , maybe not . He had made his feelings about the vineyard more than clear . He was a pollster . He was on the road working with clients three weeks out of four . He had his own business to run , and he did it well . Making wine had been his father 's passion . It was n't Greg 's . Not that he was exactly an impartial observer . If Natalie sold Asquonset , there would be money coming in , half of which eventually would be his . In that sense , it behooved him to check out a potential buyer . He did n't want his mother letting the vineyard go for anything less than it was worth . Dropping the envelope on the counter , he pulled up the laptop and typed in his password . But that envelope seemed to command his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he picked it up again , slit it open , and pulled out a card . PLEASE JOIN US FOR A CELEBRATION OF OUR WEDDING LABOR DAY SUNDAY AT 4 P.M. THE GREAT HOUSE ASQUONSET VINEYARD AND WINERY NATALIE SEEBRING AND CARL BURKE He stared blankly at the card . A wedding ? His mother and Carl ? His mother and Carl ? Where had that come from ? Natalie was seventy-six . Maybe she was losing it , he thought , shaking his head . And what about Carl ? He had to be a few years older than that . What was in his mind ? Carl had been at the vineyard forever . Alexander had considered him a friend . But a friend would n't snatch up a man 's widow less than six months after his death , any more than a man 's widow would turn right around and marry the nearest thing in pants . Understandably , Natalie would be leaning on Carl more , now that Alexander was gone . Greg had n't thought anything of the fact that lately she was mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those mentions were always in praise . It looked like Greg had missed the point . Was it romance ? Sex ? Were n't they a little old ? Greg was forty , and losing interest fast . Sex required effort , if you wanted to do it right . So maybe they did n't do it the way he did . Hell , he was embarrassed thinking of his mother doing it at all . But ... with Carl ? Carl was an old coot ! Maybe he was a clever one , though . Maybe he had his eye on the vineyard . Had n't he retired and passed the reins on to his own son ? That supposedly had been Alexander 's doing , but Carl had been vineyard manager too long not to have a say in who took over . So maybe Carl wanted Simon to have the vineyard . Maybe marrying Natalie was his way of ensuring it . Greg had to call Natalie , but Lord , he hated doing that . What could he say I do n't want the vineyard , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should call Susanne first . She saw Natalie more often than he did . She might know what was going on . Lord , he hated doing that , too . Susanne was sixteen years his senior . They shared a mother , but they had never been close . Swearing under his breath , he loosened his collar button . He did n't need this . He needed a vacation , actually had one planned . So going to Asquonset on Labor Day weekend was out of the question . He was going north , all the way to Ontario for a fishing trip . Already had it booked . Not that Jill was pleased . Given a choice , she 'd take Asquonset . She liked it there . At least , he thought she did . Hard to say lately . She was going through something . She had been quieter than usual . Could she be having a midlife crisis ? he wondered . At thirty-eight ? He did n't want to think about his wife falling apart , but it beat thinking about Natalie marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , he opened the door to the garage . Jill 's car was gone , which meant it was probably parked at the airport . Definitely visiting her mother , he decided . Then he had a thought . Hoping for a glimpse of what was bugging her thinking that the letter from her mother might hold a clue knowing that he could always say he had accidentally slit it open along with the rest of the mail he opened it and pulled out a neatly folded sheet . " Dear Greg ... " Dear Greg . It was not from his mother-in-law to Jill . It was to him . He looked quickly at the address . Not to Jill at all . To him . From Jill . Feeling a sudden foreboding , he began reading . In a garage studio behind an old white Victorian on a narrow side street in Cambridge , Massachusetts , Olivia Jones was daydreaming at work . She did it often . It was one of the perks of her job . She restored old photographs , a skill that required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had all three , along with an imagination that could take her inside the world of almost any picture . Even now , as she dotted varying shades of gray ink to restore a faded face , she was inside the frame with a family of migrant workers living in California in the early thirties . The Depression had taken hold . Life was hard , food scarce . Children worked with their parents and grandparents , hour after hour , in whatever fields needed picking . They began the day dirty and ended it more so . Their faces were somber , their cheeks gaunt , their eyes large and haunting . They sat close together on the porch of a weathered shack . Moving around them , Olivia went inside . The place was small but functional . Bedding lay against nearly every wall , with a woodstove and a few chairs in the center . The air held the smell of dust and hard work , but there was more . On a heavy table nearby sat a loaf of fresh-baked bread , aromatic and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held an assortment of cracked pottery and tin cups and plates . There would be clinking when the family ate . She could hear it now . Returning to the porch , she was drawn in with an open arm , reconnected to this group as they were connected to one another . Everyone touched a hand , an arm , a shoulder , a cheek . They were nine people spanning three generations , surviving the bleakness of their lives by taking comfort in family . They had nothing by way of material goods , only one another . Olivia was thirty-five . She had a ten-year-old daughter , a job , an apartment with a TV and VCR , a computer , and a washer and dryer . She had a car . She had a Patagonia vest , L.L.Bean clogs , and a Nikon that was old enough and sturdy enough to fetch a pretty penny . But boy , did she envy that migrant family its closeness . " Those were hard times , " came a gruff voice by her shoulder . She looked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph . It was one of several that had been newly uncovered , believed to be the work of Dorothea Lange . The Metropolitan Museum in New York had commissioned him to restore them . Olivia was doing the work . " They were simpler times , " she said . He grunted . " You want ' em ? Take ' em . I 'm leaving . Lock up when you go . " He walked off with less shuffle than another man of seventy-five might have , but then , Otis had his moods to keep him sharp . He had been in something of a snit all day , but after five years in his employ , Olivia knew not to take it personally . Otis was a frustrated Picasso , a would-be painter who would never be as good at creation as he was at restoration . But hope died hard , even at his age . He was returning to his canvas and oil full-time seven weeks away from retirement and counting . He was looking forward to it . Olivia was not . He kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're a good team , she argued . I 'm too old , he replied . And that was what intrigued her about this migrant family . The old man in the photograph was grizzled enough to make Otis look young , but he was still there , still productive , still part of that larger group . Things were different nowadays . People burned out , and no wonder . They were up on the high wire of life alone with no net . Olivia worried about Otis retiring , pictured him sitting alone day after day , with art tools that he could n't use to his own high standards and no one to bully . He was n't going to be happy . Wrong , Olivia . He had friends all over the art community and plenty of money saved up . He would be delighted . She was the one in trouble . She had finally found her niche . Restoring old photographs was a natural for someone with a knowledge of cameras and an eye for art and she had both , though it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the story of her life . She had waitressed . She had done telemarketing . She had sold clothes . Selling cameras had come after that , along with the discovery that she loved taking pictures . Then had come Tess . Then brief stints apprenticing with a professional photographer and freelancing for a museum that wanted pictures of its shows . Then Otis . For the first time in her life , Olivia truly loved her work . She was better at photo restoration than she had been at anything else , and could lose herself for hours in prints from the past , smelling the age , feeling the grandeur . For Olivia , the world of yesterday was more romantic than today . She would have liked to have lived back then . Given that she could n't , she liked working for Otis , and the feeling was mutual . Few people in her life had put up with her for five years . Granted , she indulged him his moods , and even he acknowledged that she did the job better than the long line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The eight-by-ten tacked to the wall proved it . He had taken it last week when she had shown up at work with her hair cut painfully short . She had chopped it off herself in a fit of disgust , irritated with long hair in the sweltering heat . Immediately she had regretted it . A barber had neatened things up a bit , but she had gone on to work wearing a big straw hat which Otis had promptly removed . Bless his soul , he said that he liked her hair short , said that it made her look lighthearted and fun and then he proceeded to catch just that on film . She was standing in front of a plain concrete wall , wearing a long tank dress , toes peeking from sandals , hair boyish . Feeling exposed and awkward , as unused to being on that side of the camera as she was embarrassed about her hair , she had wrapped her arms around her middle and tucked in her chin . Otis had used light , angle , and focus to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-conscious . He had made the shiny strands of that short , sandy hair look stylish , and the maroon polish on her toenails look exotic . He had made her brown eyes large in a delicate face . Somehow , he had made her look pretty . When her eyes slid from that photograph to another tacked nearby , her smile widened . Tess was with her in that one , nine years old the summer before . They were dressed as a pair of dance hall girls in a Dodge City saloon in the days of the wild , wild West . Otis had condemned the picture as the lowest form of commercial photography , but they 'd had a ball dressing up . They talked about going for an Elizabethan look this summer assuming they could afford another weekend at the shore . Money was tighter now , without child support . The reality of that was just sinking in . Jared Stark had let her down in every imaginable way . He was supposed to have loved her . Barring that , he was supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to have helped keep that child sheltered and clothed . So , what had he done ? He had died . A timer rang . Setting aside the anger that had displaced grief , Olivia silenced it . Tess was the love of her life , and school was nearly out for the day . Recapping her inks , she washed her brushes and carefully placed the maybe-Lange photographs in the vault . She neatened the office , filled her briefcase with paperwork to do at home , and opened the door in time to greet the mailman . Otis 's personal letters and bills went in one pile , those addressed to the studio went in another . Among the larger pieces there was a supermarket flyer , a mailing from the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works , and the week 's Time . At the bottom of the pile was a large manila pack . One look at its sender and Olivia felt a wave of pleasure . The mailing label was ivory with a burgundy logo that depicted , in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wineglass . Beneath it was the stylized script so familiar now that read Asquonset Vineyard and Winery , Asquonset , Rhode Island . The address was handwritten in the more traditional but no less familiar style of Natalie Seebring . Holding the large envelope to her nose , Olivia closed her eyes and inhaled . She knew that freesia scent now as well as she knew the handwriting . It was elegant , conjuring images of prosperity and warmth . She basked in it for a minute , then crossed to the large table where the last batch of Seebring photographs lay . They were from the early fifties and had needed varying degrees of repair , but they were ready for return . Now there was a new pack . Natalie 's timing was perfect . Olivia had never met the woman , but she felt she knew her well . Photographs told stories , and what they did n't tell , Olivia easily made up . Natalie had been a beautiful child in the twenties , a striking teenager in the thirties . In the forties she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifties , the smiling mother of two adoring children . According to her photographs , she dressed well and lived in style . Whether a parlor with an exquisite Oriental rug in the foreground , an elegantly upholstered settee at midrange , and original art on the wall behind , or a garden surrounded by lush shrubbery that screamed of color even in black-and-white , the backgrounds of the pictures she sent were entirely consistent with the image of a successful wine-making family . No downtrodden migrant crew this one . Of course , these pictures did n't have the artistic import of one taken by Dorothea Lange , but Olivia had followed the growth of this family for months and was totally involved . The appeal here was prosperity and ease . She had fantasized about being a Seebring more times than she could count . Her own story was light-years different from anything she had seen in the Seebring pictures . She had never met her father . Her mother did n't even know who he was . Olivia had been the product of a one-night stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's Times Square . Carol Jones , her mother , had been seventeen at the time . Feminists might have called it rape , but months later , when Carol finally realized she was pregnant , she was rebellious enough and defiant enough to tell her parents it was love . For those pious folk , the pregnancy was one defiant act too many . They disowned her . She retaliated , predictably rebellious and defiant , by leaving home with nothing of her heritage but her name Jones . A lot of good that did Olivia . There were pages of Jones listings in every telephone directory . There were pages and pages of them in New York . And now , not only could n't she find her grandparents , she could n't find her mother either . Moving from place to place herself , Olivia had left a trail of bread crumbs to rival Hansel and Gretel , but no relative ever came looking . Apparently , no relative cared and it was their loss . Olivia might be no prize , but Tess was . Tess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . This gap in her history meant that Olivia and Tess went without extended family . It was just the two of them just the two of them against the world . That was n't so bad , though ; Olivia had come to terms with it . She could cope . It did n't mean she could n't dream , of course , and lately she dreamed she was related to Natalie Seebring . Being grandmother and granddaughter was pushing it a little , but there was a woman in some of the early Asquonset pictures who , given a marginal resemblance to Carol , could be Olivia 's grandmother . Olivia had n't seen the woman in any of Asquonset 's postwar pictures , but there were easy explanations for that . She might have been a WAC who had fallen for a serviceman and ended up in New York . Her husband might have been a rigid military type who wanted things done his way , or he might have been irrationally jealous , forbidding her contact with her family . Hence , her absence in photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie would be Olivia 's great-aunt . Even if she were only a cousin , the blood bond would be there . Olivia glanced at the clock . She had to go get Tess . Time was growing short . But the lure of this new package was too great to resist . Opening the clasp , she peeked inside . The scent of freesia was stronger now . She pushed aside a cover letter and saw several dozen photographs . Most were eight-by-tens in black-and-white . Under them was a bright yellow envelope . Curious , she pulled it out . Otis 's name and address were on the front , written not in Natalie 's freehand but in a calligrapher 's script . She was giving a party , Olivia decided and immediately vowed to go as Otis 's date . She did n't care if people snickered behind their hands . She wanted to see Asquonset . She wanted to meet Natalie . She laid the invitation on Otis 's desk with his personal mail then quickly took it back and returned it to the mailer with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She liked the idea of having the invitation in her own house for a night . Tucking the package into her briefcase , she checked the office a final time , then let herself out and locked the door . Natalie 's new batch of pictures would be the treat she gave herself that night when everything else was done . Savoring the anticipation , she half walked , half ran through narrow streets hemmed in by tightly packed houses , trees , and parked cars . The June air was stagnant and warm . She arrived at Tess 's school in a sweat , a full ten minutes late . Most of the children had gone . A few stragglers remained on the playground , but they were immersed in themselves . Tess stood alone at a corner of the school yard with a shoulder weighted down by her backpack , one foot turned in , her glasses halfway down her nose , and a desolate look on her face .                   @ @
