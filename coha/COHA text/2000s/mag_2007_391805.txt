The town of Catumbela , in Central Angola , sits on a sprawling , fertile plateau planted with plantains and mangos . At the far end of town is a defunct paper mill . There , for several months earlier this year , a group of Chinese railway engineers and laborers camped out in the shadow of two idle smokestacks . The team was one of several sent to this isolated stretch of Angola 's interior to build a railroad that will one day connect the African hinterlands to the Atlantic port city of Lobito , several hundred miles to the west . It 's a $2 billion project and a colossal dream-a way to bypass Angola 's sparse , decrepit roads , which like so many in Africa are strewn with land mines and liable to be washed out by flash floods . There 's only one problem : work has stalled . Along the railroad line at least 16 camps that once bustled with Chinese workers and equipment have been abandoned or shut down completely . In those that remain , row upon row of front-loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of Angolan soldiers . And the Chinese ? " They 're gone , " says a scrawny guard at the entrance to Catumbela 's paper mill , as he stares disconsolately at the tracks . " I do n't know when they 're coming back-they ate their dogs and left . " Africa has rarely been kind to the grand visions of others-whether Dr. Livingstone or Bono . The Chinese are finding , to their surprise , that they 're no exception . The Lobito railroad has fallen victim to a high-level dispute between the Angolan and Chinese governments . So have dozens of other deals , including another $2 billion contract , to build an oil refinery in Lobito . The American Embassy says that project will now most likely be awarded to Bechtel . " The Chinese thought they 'd come in here and make a killing , " says a Western diplomat in the capital , Luanda , who was not authorized to speak on the record . " Now they 're facing the reality-it 's hard to do things here . " Overall , China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sucking up oil from Sudan , cutting down timber in Guinea and mining copper and zinc from the Congo . Beijing recently bought a major stake in South Africa 's Standard Bank to fund infrastructure projects throughout the continent . And the Chinese are far outpacing their Western rivals . China has opened more embassies in Africa than the United States has , and is even investing heavily in countries , like Rwanda , where the immediate returns are murky at best . Last year trade between Africa and China topped $50 billion . By 2010 it 's projected to reach $100 billion . But all that money-China has extended $11 billion in loans to Angola , more than the World Bank-does n't mean the Chinese working in Africa are insulated from the continent 's troubles . Kidnappings , killings and death threats have plagued Chinese workers from the Niger Delta to the eastern reaches of Ethiopia , where rebels ambushed and slaughtered 17 Chinese oil workers last year . Angola is now China 's biggest supplier of crude oil , and Chinese money helped propel the local economy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a chaotic , corrupt country that has only recently emerged from a vicious civil war . For Chinese businessmen and workers , it 's turning out to be a sobering , even dangerous place . Chinese laborers are venturing deep into the lush Angolan countryside , not just the capital and larger cities . Tens of thousands of Chinese-made PMN-2 mines are still buried there , remnants of the Angolan civil war , which killed more than a million people . De-mining crews are digging the explosives out of the ground , but nowhere near fast enough for the Chinese . So the foreigners improvise . " With a front loader we push the dirt and if there 's a mine there it explodes , " says Zhou Zhenhong , manager of Kaituo Construction and Enterprises . " It 's faster that way , and less expensive than being late . " The costs , however , can be more than monetary : on Oct. 24 a Chinese laborer for the Chinese telecom giant Huawei was digging a trench for fiber-optic cable near the southern town of Benguela when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also injured . " We 've tried to tell them to be careful and they just shrug their shoulders , " says Rebecca Thompson , who directs a Norwegian de-mining NGO in Luanda . Western executives-hidden behind the walls of their villas-have bred a certain kind of resentment in Africa . In Angola the much more numerous and adventurous Chinese are suffering from another . Perhaps as many as 100,000 Chinese workers have spread out across the country , many breaking rock on highways or pouring concrete at construction sites . Most live in isolated camps . Few speak English ; fewer still speak Portuguese . State-owned Chinese companies prohibit any type of fraternization between their employees and Angolans . If a worker becomes romantically or sexually involved with a local , he 's quickly hustled back to China . " Africans and Chinese think differently , " says Xia Yi Hua , a regional director for China Jiang Su , a massive construction conglomerate with offices across Angola . Xia has been in the country for four years , and his company still sends him shrink-wrapped packets of Chinese food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything in his office comes from China . One coffee table is made of Angolan wood , he admits , but he flew in a Chinese carpenter to fashion the table . Racist stereotypes are common : both sides accuse the other of looking or behaving like monkeys or pigs . The Angolans claim ( without good evidence ) that the Chinese eat their dogs . At most work sites Chinese supervisors oversee black laborers , which has created friction . " You Chinese come to Angola and order us around , but in your own country you are suffering , " says an Angolan who works for a Chinese company . ( He asked not to be named for fear of losing his job . ) At one Chinese-run construction site NEWSWEEK visited , hungry workers begged for food , saying their Chinese bosses never fed them . ( The bosses say that 's not their responsibility . ) Angolans laying fiber-optic cable for Huawei near Benguela say they must dig 16 feet a day , or else they wo n't be paid their $5 daily wage . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavar , which is repeated again and again : dig , dig . The tensions go all the way to the top of the food chain . The Chinese say Angolan government funding for the Lobito railroad has dried up mysteriously ; the Angolans say the Chinese stopped working because of mines along the route . Western diplomats in Luanda , who customarily speak only on condition of anonymity , suspect that the dispute has to do with kickbacks but can not prove anything . They say that the government 's finances are incredibly murky , and its dealings with the Chinese murkier still . " Is it all getting stolen ? I do n't think so , " one Western diplomat says of the billions in oil money flooding into Angola 's treasury . " But it 's not clear to me that there 's anyone in the government who can actually tell you where all the money is . If there is , it 's going to be somebody like Al Capone 's bookkeeper . " Even China 's success in Angola is creating headaches for its businessmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance . Good luck finding a cab-the city has only one official taxi service-or renting a car , which can go for as much as $12,000 a month . Rents for houses in Lobito are double that . The extremes of poverty and wealth are deep , and worrisome . Where there are roads in Luanda-much of the city remains a hive of rock-strewn dirt tracks-they are choked with bright yellow Hummers and souped-up Chevy Blazers . Chinese-built mansions for Angolan ministers loom grotesquely on Luanda 's hillsides , just above shantytowns where millions of refugees took up residence during the worst years of war . For Mr. Li , a local director for the Guang Xi construction company , the boom is a mixed blessing . Li , who asked that only his last name be used , lives in a cavernous supermarket warehouse in Lobito , with sheets hung on clotheslines to create sleeping areas for his 20 workers . He spends much of his time slogging around the city , begging for the cement his crew needs to build bases for cell- phone towers . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark with 12 small bags of cement , all bought at retail prices . " Everything is waiting , waiting , " he says , worried about the pace of his project . A Brazilian company has promised to build two new cement factories in Luanda , but so far work has n't begun . Beijing takes the long view in Africa , figuring its investments now are building good will for the future . But every economy the Chinese help revive becomes that much more attractive to their rivals , too . Already American firms Bechtel and KBR are bidding for infrastructure projects in Angola . Oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron are increasing their presence in the country . The Brazilian firm Odebrecht is building a highway to compete with the Chinese railroad to Lobito , South African companies are repairing the electrical grid near the oilfields in northern Angola , and the Portuguese are horning in on construction projects in and around Luanda . " In this country , you can get projects for $10 million and do $1 million in profit , " says Zhou Zhenhong , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lobito . For that kind of money , a lot of people will be willing to put up with the same hassles as the Chinese . photo : CHINA 'S NEW ARMY : Perhaps as many as 100,000 Chinese workers have spread out across Angola , laying railroad tracks , paving new highways and building hotels and homes PHOTOGRAPHS BY PAOLO WOODS FOR NEWSWEEK <p>
