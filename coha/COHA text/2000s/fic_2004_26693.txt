The Samurai 's Daughter Chapter One " Way too salty . I bet the chef used instant dashi powder . " My judgment delivered , I laid down the chopsticks I 'd used to spear a slippery cube of tofu from the unfortunate miso soup . The Asian-American waitress who 'd served us passed by with a smile ; apparently , she did n't understand Japanese . Well , this was San Francisco , packed full of people with faces that mirrored the world 's races , but who often spoke only English . I guessed that I 'd been saved . " But this soup is so tasty ! " Toshiro Shimura , my father , raked a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair . It was cut in a slightly shaggy style typical for a San Francisco psychiatrist  --  but was distinctly odd for a Japanese-born , fifty-something man . " Rei-chan , you do n't realize how hard it is to find pure Japanese ingredients here . Anyway , I hear that in Japan a lot of the cooks now use bonito powder . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the kind that 's so hard that it feels like a piece of wood . " I closed my eyes for a minute , feeling nostalgic for the petrified hunk of fish resting in a wooden box in my tiny kitchenette in North Tokyo . " It 's worth the extra effort because then the soup tastes like it comes from the sea , not the convenience store . Now , Dad , where were we ? The ten grave precepts of Buddhism . The ones your grandfather felt were so important to live by . I thought it was interesting that he had them on display . " " Yes , they were recorded on a calligraphy scroll . I think it originally came from a monastery , but it hung in the office where he worked . Unfortunately , I do n't know where it is now . " " Do you recall , approximately , what it said ? " " The precepts . You know them , do n't you ? " I rolled my eyes . " I know some of them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember ? " " But you did take an Eastern religions class at Berkeley , yes ? " " It was so long ago , Dad . just tell me . This is an oral history project , not a go-to-the-library project . I remember the first one : Do n't kill . The next : Do n't steal . And then the one about not lying  --  " " Well , the precept against lying is actually the fourth , not the third , if I remember correctly . And in Japan , it 's always been considered allowable to tell certain kinds of lies out of compassion , or because that lie serves a greater good . " " Well , I 'd agree with that , " I said . " What was the third one , then ? " " It 's a precept against sex . Misusing sex , to be exact . That would cover situations such as rape and extramarital sex and  --  " " Fine . Ah , what 's number five ? " I was n't going to pursue the subtleties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too up-close and personal . It had been two years since I 'd last come home to San Francisco , and I wanted to leave on as good terms as I 'd arrived . " That , if I remember correctly , is not to give or take drugs . " " But priests drink sake all the time ! " I pointed out . " Well , a person may take sake , but not in an amount to cause intoxication . My grandfather drank sake at supper , but only a single glass . " " Would you say in general that laypeople 's interpretations of these rules were looser than that of priests ? I mean , Zen priests do n't eat meat , but most people in Japan do . But how is it that people are allowed to eat meat , when the first precept is against killing ? " " That 's the rule I thought my vegetarian daughter would jump on . " My father laughed . " The answer is that killing animals in self-defense , or to eat them , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sport . " " Aha . So the basis of the rule is that an animal 's life is valued only when it might be threatened with involvement in a game , say hunting or cockfighting , " I said . " I 'm not sure I agree with that . A death is a death , to me . But the rule certainly provides an interesting look at the Japanese mind . " " The Buddhist mind , " my father corrected me . " And as you know , Buddhism has its origins in India , and these laws are known to Buddhists in all nations . They are universal . " I put my notebook aside for a break , because as much as I 'd complained about the noodles , I was hungry for them . Actually , my feelings about food , my hometown , and my father were about as mixed up as the Buddhist rules . San Francisco was a typical tourist 's dream , but in my mind it was a far second to Tokyo , my adopted home . Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you enjoy it with all the rolling power blackouts ? My parents ' lifestyles had changed dramatically since California had faced its energy crisis  --  their huge Victorian home was no longer lit up welcomingly in the evenings , not even now , at Christmas , when my mother once had routinely lit electric candles in all sixty windows . Tokyo did n't have such problems yet . And when there , it was easy for me to live simply , keeping my appreciation low to the ground , for things like the miniature Shinto shrines decorated with good luck fox statues , and the gracious rows of persimmon trees that line the ugly train tracks . And then , there were the Japanese people : the serene older generation moving through their own private dances of tai chi in the city 's small parks , and the serious kindergarten students striding off to school wearing the kind of saucer-shaped hat and tidy uniform that had n't changed since the 1920s . Not to mention my father 's brother , Uncle Hiroshi , Aunt Norie , and my cousin Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : so important that I planned to hightail it out of America before December 31 so I would n't miss New Year 's Day with them ...
