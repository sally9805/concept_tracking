" FOR ULTIMATE PROTECTION " Cosmetics with SPF are not enough to keep you covered , " says Fredric Brandt , M.D. , a dermatologist with offices in New York City and Miami who urges everyone to wear sunscreen . " The SPF only lasts as long as the products they 're in . As the makeup fades , so does its protection . " Makeup shifts throughout the day , settling into fine lines and hair follicles , leaving skin prone to sun damage . In addition , women do n't typically apply makeup thickly enough for adequate protection . Brandt recommends using a sunscreen every day without fail or always applying an SPF moisturizer underneath makeup .
