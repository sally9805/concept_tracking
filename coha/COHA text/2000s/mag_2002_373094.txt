First it was rising seas and altered weather . Now , say experts writing in Science , global warming is helping spread disease as well  --  not just in humans but also in oysters , butterflies , birds and plants . Says co-author Richard Ostfeld of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook , N.Y. : " The evidence cuts across so many diseases and organisms that it has us quite alarmed . " <P> Part of the danger comes from pests that carry such illnesses as malaria , dengue fever and Lyme disease , which are expanding their ranges from the tropics toward the poles or to higher altitudes . Parasites like warm weather too : a tiny protozoan that breeds between the abdominal scales of monarch butterflies is just one example . <P> The news is not all bad : some fungi , including those that are wiping out frogs in Australia and Central America , are happier in cool weather . But on balance , says Ostfeld , " a warmer world will be a sicker world . "  --  A.D. and M.D.L.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
