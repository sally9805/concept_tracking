Considering that Vice President Dick Cheney had come a long way to help Florida Congressman Ric Keller raise $250,000 last week , the reception he got in the Sunshine State could have been a bit warmer . After extolling Cheney as " one of the most effective Vice Presidents in the history of the U.S. , " Keller launched into all the times he had recently opposed the Bush Administration , including the deal to allow a Dubai company to manage operations at several U.S. ports . And then Keller went right for the punch line : " ' Do n't be too hasty , ' " he claimed the Vice President had pleaded with him . " ' Let 's go hunting . We 'll talk about it .
