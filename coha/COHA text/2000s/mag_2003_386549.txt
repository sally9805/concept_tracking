With his wild and whimsical imagery , the Russian-born artist bucked the trends of 20th-century art <p> DAVID McNEIL fondly remembers the day in the early 1960s his father took him to a little bistro on Paris ' Ile St. Louis , the kind of place where they scrawl the menu in white letters on the mirror behind the bar , and masons , house painters , plumbers and other workingmen down hearty lunches along with vin ordinaire . Wearing a beret , a battered jacket and a coarse , checkered shirt , his father-then in his mid-70s  --  fit in perfectly With conversation flowing easily among the close-set tables , one of the patrons looked over at the muscular , paint-splotched hands of the man in the beret . " Working on a place around here ? " he asked companionably " Yeah , " replied McNeil 's father , the artist Marc Chagall , as he tucked into his appetizer of hard-boiled egg and mayonnaise . " I 'm redoing a ceiling over at the Opra . " <p> Chagall , the Russian-born painter who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blue cows , flying lovers , biblical prophets and green-faced fiddlers on roofs , had a firm idea of who he was and what he wanted to accomplish . But when it came to guarding his privacy , he was a master of deflection . Sometimes when people approached to ask if he was that famous painter Marc Chagall , he would answer , " No , " or more absurdly , " I do n't think so , " or point to someone else and say slyly , " Maybe that 's him . " With his slanting , pale-blue eyes , his unruly hair and the mobile face of a mischievous faun , Chagall gave one biographer the impression that he was " always slightly hallucinating . " One of those who knew him best , Virginia Haggard McNeil , David 's mother and Chagall 's companion for seven years , characterized him as " full of contradictions  --  generous and guarded , nave and shrewd , explosive and secret , humorous and sad , vulnerable and strong . " <p> Chagall himself said he was a dreamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to decrypt his symbols , " says Jean-Michel Foray , director of the Marc Chagall Biblical Message Museum in Nice , " but there 's no consensus on what they mean . We can not interpret them because they are simply part of his world , like figures from a dream . " Pablo Picasso , his sometime friend and rival ( " What a genius , that Picasso , " Chagall once joked . " It 's a pity he does n't paint " ) , marveled at the Russian 's feeling for fight and the originality of his imagery . " I do n't know where he gets those images .... " said Picasso . " He must have an angel in his head . " <p> Throughout his 75-year career , during which he produced an astounding 10,000 works , Chagall continued to incorporate figurative and narrative elements ( however enigmatic ) into his paintings . His warm , human pictorial universe , full of personal metaphor , set him apart from much of 20th-century art , with its intellectual deconstruction of objects and arid abstraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , while the critics were often dismissive , complaining of sentimentality , repetition and the use of stock figures . <p> A major retrospective of Chagall 's unique , often puzzling images was recently on view at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , following a highly acclaimed run at the Grand Palais in Paris . The first comprehensive exhibition of Chagall 's paintings since 1985 brought together more than 150 works from all periods of his career , many never before seen in the United States , including cloth-and-paper collages from the private collection of his granddaughter Meret Meyer Graber . The exhibition , says Foray , the chief organizer of the show , " offered a fresh opportunity to appreciate Chagall as the painter who restored to art the elements that modern artists rejected , such as allegory and narrative  --  art as a comment on life . Today he is coming back strong after a period of neglect , even in his home country . " Retrospectives are planned for 2005 at the Museum of Russian Art in St. Petersburg and at the State Tretiakov Gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he put it , " born dead " on July 7 , 1887 , in the Belorussian town of Vitebsk , near the Polish border . His distraught family pricked the limp body of their firstborn with needles to try to stimulate a response . Desperate , they then took the infant outside and put him in a stone trough of cold water . Suddenly the baby boy began to whimper . With that rude introduction to life , it 's no wonder that Marc Chagall , as he later chose to be known in Paris , stuttered as a boy and was subject to fainting . " I was scared of growing up , " he told Virginia McNeil . " Even in my twenties I preferred dreaming about love and painting it in my pictures . " <p> Chagall 's talent for drawing hardly cheered his poor and numerous family , which he , as the eldest of nine children , was expected to help support . His father , Khatskel-Mordechai Chagal , worked in a herring warehouse ; his mother , Feigaita Chernina , ran a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious beliefs , which forbade graphic representation of anything created by God . Thus Chagall grew up in a home devoid of images . Still , he pestered his mother until she took him to an art school run by a local portraitist . Chagall , in his late teens , was the only student who used the vivid color violet . A pious uncle refused to shake his hand after he began painting figures . <p> For all his subsequent pictorial reminiscing about Vitebsk , Chagall found it stifling and provincial  --  " a strange town , an unhappy town , a boring town , " he called it in his memoirs . In 1906 , at age 19 , he wangled a small sum of money from his father and left for St. Petersburg , where he enrolled in the drawing school of the Imperial Society for the Protection of Fine Arts . But he hated classical art training . " I , poor country lad , was obliged to acquaint myself thoroughly with the wretched nostrils of Alexander of Macedonia or some other plaster imbecile , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he made a few kopecks retouching photographs and painting signs , he sometimes collapsed from hunger . His world broadened in 1909 when he signed up for an art class in St. Petersburg taught by Leon Bakst , who , having been to Paris , carried an aura of sophistication . Bakst indulged Chagall 's expressive , unconventional approach to painting and dropped names , exotic to the young man 's ears , such as Manet , Czanne and Matisse . He spoke of painting cubes and squares , of an artist who cut off his ear . <p> " Paris ! " Chagall wrote in his autobiography . " No word sounded sweeter to me ! " By 1911 , at age 24 , he was there , thanks to a stipend of 40 rubles a month from a supportive member of the Duma , Russia 's elective assembly , who had taken a liking to the young artist . When he arrived , he went directly to the Louvre to look at the famous works of art there . In time he found a room at an artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called La Ruche ( The Beehive ) . He lived frugally Often he 'd cut a herring in half , the head for one day , the tail for the next . Friends who came to his door had to wait while he put on his clothes ; he painted in the nude to avoid staining his only outfit . <p> At La Ruche , Chagall rubbed shoulders with painters like Fernand Lger , Chaim Soutine , Amedeo Modigliani and Robert Delaunay True to his nature as a storyteller , however , he seemed to have more in common with such writers as French poet Guillaume Apollinaire , who described Chagall 's work as " supernatural . " Another friend , Blaise Cendrars , a restless , knockabout writer , penned a short poem about Chagall : " Suddenly he paints / He grabs a church and paints with a church / He grabs a cow and paints with a cow . " <p> Many consider Chagall 's work during his four-year stay in Paris his most boldly creative . Reconnoitering the then-prevalent trends of Cubism and Fauvism , he absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Cubist-influenced Temptation ( Adam and Eve ) ; the disconcerting Introduction , with a seven-fingered man holding his head under his arm ; and the parti-colored Acrobat , showing Chagall 's fondness for circus scenes . At La Ruche he also painted his explosive Dedicated to My Fiance , which he tossed off in a single night 's feverish work and later submitted to a major Paris exhibition . It took some artful persuasion on his part to convince the show 's organizers that the topsy-turvy mix of hands , legs and a leering bull 's head was not , as they contended , pornographic . <p> Returning to Vitebsk in 1914 with the intention of staying only briefly , Chagall was trapped by the outbreak of World War I. At least that meant spending time with his fiance , Bella Rosenfeld , the beautiful , cultivated daughter of one of the town 's wealthiest families . Bella had won a gold medal as one of Russia 's top high-school students , had studied in Moscow and had ambitions to be an actress . But she had fallen for Chagall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window to bring him cakes and milk . " I had only to open the window of my room and blue air , love and flowers entered with her , " Chagall later wrote . Despite her family 's worries that she would starve as the wife of an artist , the pair married in 1915 ; Chagall was 28 , Bella , 23 . In his 1914-18 Above the Town ( one of his many paintings of flying lovers ) , he and Bella soar blissfully above Vitebsk . <p> In 1917 Chagall embraced the Bolshevik Revolution . He liked that the new regime gave Jews full citizenship and no longer required them to carry passports to leave their designated region . And he was pleased to be appointed commissar for art in Vitebsk , where he started an art school and brought in avant-garde teachers . But it soon became clear that the revolutionaries preferred abstract art and Socialist Realism  --  and how , they wondered , did the comrade 's blue cows and floating lovers support Marxism-Leninism ? Giving up his job as commissar in 1920 , Chagall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Jewish Chamber Theater . But ultimately unhappy with Soviet life , he left for Berlin in 1922 and settled in Paris a year and a half later along with Bella and their 6-year-old daughter , Ida . <p> In Paris , a new door opened for Chagall when he met the influential art dealer Ambroise Vollard , who commissioned him to illustrate an edition of the poetic classic the Fables of La Fontaine . Chauvinistic French officials cried scandal over the choice of a Russian Jew , a mere " Vitebsk sign painter , " to illustrate a masterpiece of French letters . But that blew over , and Chagall went on to do a series of resonant illustrations of the Bible for Vollard . <p> Increasingly alarmed by Nazi persecution of the Jews , Chagall made a strong political statement on canvas in 1938 with his White Crucifixion . Then 51 and in his artistic prime , he portrayed the crucified Christ , his loins covered with a prayer shawl , as a symbol of the suffering of all Jews . In the painting , a synagogue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torah to his breast , and emigrants try to escape in a rudimentary boat . Not long after , in June 1941 , Chagall and his wife boarded a ship for the United States , settling in New York City . <p> The six years Chagall spent in America were not his happiest . He never got used to the pace of New York life , never learned English . " It took me thirty years to learn bad French , " he said , " why should I try to learn English ? " One of the things he did enjoy was strolling through Lower Manhattan , buying strudel and gefilte fish , and reading Yiddish newspapers . His palette during these years often darkened to a tragic tone , with depictions of a burning Vitebsk and fleeing rabbis . When Bella , his muse , confidante and best critic , died suddenly in 1944 of a viral infection at age 52 , " everything turned black , " Chagall wrote . <p> After weeks of sitting in his apartment on Riverside Drive immersed in grief , tended to by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to work again . Ida found a French-speaking English woman , Virginia McNeil , to be his housekeeper . A diplomat 's daughter , and bright , rebellious and cosmopolitan , McNeil had been born in Paris and raised in Bolivia and Cuba , but had recently fallen on hard times . She was married to John McNeil , a Scottish painter who suffered from depression , and she had a 5-year-old daughter , Jean , to support . She was 30 and Chagall 57 when they met , and before long the two were talking painting , then dining together . A few months later Virginia left her husband and went with Chagall to live in High Falls , New York , a village in the Catskills . They bought a simple wooden house with an adjoining cottage for him to use as a studio . <p> Though Chagall would do several important public works in the United States  --  sets and costumes for a 1942 American Ballet Theatre production of Tchaikovsky 's Aleko and a 1945 version of Stravinsky 's Firebird , and later large murals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Art Institute of Chicago  --  he remained ambivalent about America . " I know I must live in France , but I do n't want to cut myself off from America , " he once said . " France is a picture already painted . America still has to be painted . Maybe that 's why I feel freer there . But when I work in America , it 's like shouting in a forest . There 's no echo . " <p> In 1948 he returned to France with Virginia , their son , David , born in 1946 , and Virginia 's daughter . They eventually settled in Provence , in the hilltop town of Vence . But Virginia chafed in her role , as she saw it , of " the wife of the Famous Artist , the charming hostess to Important People , " and abruptly left Chagall in 1951 , taking the two children with her . Once again the resourceful Ida found her father a housekeeper  --  this time in the person of Valentina Brodsky , a 40-year-old Russian living in London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known , soon married . <p> The new Mrs. Chagall managed her husband 's affairs with an iron hand . " She tended to cut him off from the world , " says David McNeil , 57 , an author and songwriter who lives in Paris . " But he did n't really mind because what he needed most was a manager to give him peace and quiet so he could get on with his work . I never saw him answer a telephone himself . After Vava took over , I do n't think he ever saw his bank statements and did n't realize how wealthy he was . He taught me to visit the Louvre on Sun- day , when it was free , and he always picked up all the sugar cubes on the table before leaving a restaurant . " McNeil and his half sister , Ida , who died in 1994 at age 78 , gradually found themselves seeing less of their father . But to all appearances Chagall 's married life was a contented one , and images of Vava appear in many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced lithographs , etchings , sculptures , ceramics , mosaics and tapestries . He also took on such demanding projects as designing stained-glass windows for the synagogue of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem . His ceiling for the Paris Opra , painted in 1963-64 and peopled with Chagall angels , lovers , animals and Parisian monuments , provided a dramatic contrast to the pompous , academic painting and decoration in the rest of the Opra . <p> " He prepared his charcoal pencils , holding them in his hand like a little bouquet , " McNeil wrote of his father 's working methods in a memoir that was published in France last spring . " Then he would sit in a large straw chair and look at the blank canvas or cardboard or sheet of paper , waiting for the idea to come . Suddenly he would raise the charcoal with his thumb and , very fast , start tracing straight lines , ovals , lozenges , finding an aesthetic structure in the incoherence . A clown would appear , a juggler , a horse , a violinist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in place , he would back off and sit down , exhausted like a boxer at the end of a round . " <p> Some critics said he drew badly " Of course I draw badly , " Chagall once said . " I like drawing badly . " Perhaps worse , from the critics ' point of view , he did not fit easily into the accepted canon of modernity . " Impressionism and Cubism are foreign to me , " he wrote . " Art seems to me to be above all a state of soul .... Let them eat their fill of their square pears on their triangular tables ! " <p> Notes veteran art critic Pierre Schneider , " Chagall absorbed Cubism , Fauvism , Surrealism , Expressionism and other modern art trends incredibly fast when he was starting out . But he used them only to suit his own aesthetic purposes . That makes it hard for art critics and historians to label him . He ca n't be pigeonholed .
