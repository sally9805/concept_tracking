The ex-con played by Mark Wahlberg would not seem to be short on glamour : his mother is Ellen Burstyn ; his aunt is Faye Dunaway ; the girl he left behind is Charlize Theron . But he and the movie do lack drama . This all-star study in blue-collar venality ( remember Cop Land ? ) is both speech- and sight-impaired : the dialogue is all mumbles and whispers ; the palette dabbles in blacks and dark browns . The film is so muted it disappears from your view even before it recedes from your memory . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
