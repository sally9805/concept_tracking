Q My son is almost three and refuses to use the toilet - he gets upset if we even suggest he try . Did we wait too long to start toilet training ? A There 's no magic window when it comes to introducing the idea of toilet training , says Judy Amali , a Calgary parent educator and author of Discipline Without Distress . " Most children just have their individual timetable , the same way some kids walk or talk sooner than others . " That said , boys tend to start a little later than girls , adds Alicia Szielasko , a psychologist in Halifax . But the worst thing a parent can do is try to push the idea on an unwilling child . " If your son does n't want anything to do with the potty , it 's best to just back off and wait , " she says . " When he gives you a sign he 's ready , only then is it time to try again . " Q My daughter has completely mastered toilet training at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had a few accidents at the mall ) . She says the bathroom is loud and scary , and she wo n't even go inside . What should we do ? A An aversion to using unfamiliar public restrooms is common for kids , not to mention many adults . " To decrease that anxiety , make home a comfortable place , then maybe move on to Grandma 's , then the neighbours ' - and slowly work up to expanding her comfort zone , " says Anita Greig , a family doctor in Toronto . The important thing is to help your daughter face her fears , instead of trying to rescue her by avoiding them , adds Alyson Schfer , a psychotherapist in Toronto and author of Honey , I Wrecked the Kids . She recommends simply being supportive and doing what you can to make the situation less threatening . " If it 's the sound of public bathrooms in general or the loud flush that frightens her , teach her to put her hands over her ears or to hum the Happy Birthday song in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really well . Lately , though , our daughter has been having some accidents again . Is it normal for her to regress - seemingly for no reason ? A Going from diapers to totally trained is a process that can take anywhere up to a year , with plenty of ups and downs along the way . Regression is normal , especially if a child is experiencing any kind of stress or change , such as the arrival of a new baby , moving house or starting school , says Szielasko . " If your daughter feels insecure about anything , even a minor disruption to her routine , she may begin having accidents again . " This sudden change may simply mean a child is just not ready for whatever reason . She can be very into the whole training thing for a while because it 's fun and new , then suddenly stop - which can be pretty frustrating for parents , says Schfer . It might help to know that other than the teen years , the toddler years are probably the most rebellious stage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiological , they 're interpersonal between the child and parent , like getting undue attention or creating a power struggle , " says Schfer . " If she 's resisting in an attempt to assert her independence , the minute you take the pressure off is the minute she 'll likely stop resisting . " If accidents start happening on a regular basis , try using cloth underpants instead of Pull-Ups . " Pull-Ups can become just an expensive diaper and sometimes kids need to feel the wet against their skin to tell them : Oops , I just had an accident " Arnall says . Sweatpants or plastic underpants over cloth underwear can be helpful so that when accidents do happen , they 're a bit more contained . There 's nothing wrong with putting her back in diapers for a few weeks or months until she 's ready to resume toilet training , says Greig . " She has been dry before , so she knows how nice it is . Just give her lots of support and gentle encouragement , and it will come back . " Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can always reintroduce toilet training when she 's in a better space and at a more co-operative stage , " says Arnall . Q My son will pee in the toilet , but that 's it , and I 'm worried that he will get constipated . How can we get him to have a bowel movement in the toilet too ? A From a practical perspective , if you 're worried about constipation you can try increasing the fibre in your son 's diet as well as his water intake , so that his stools stay soft , says Schfer . When it comes to being physically able to have a bowel movement on the toilet , she says , your son 's feet need to be planted firmly on the floor or on a stool . " If his feet are dangling over the edge , he ca n't engage his pelvic floor muscles . " Constipation can sometimes become a problem if your child feels pressure or anxiety around toilet training . And once he starts holding it , he can end up with an anal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to associate bowel movements with pain , meaning that he 'll start holding even more . " Because you want to avoid this at all costs , there has to be no pressure around the process , " Schfer says . " We have to forget our own agendas , the preschool 's agendas , the grandparents ' agendas - this is the child 's job and we 're just the assistant . Period . We 're like poop doulas and we 're only there to provide support . " If your son is already nervous about pooping in the toilet , it 's important to minimize discussions about it , especially if you find yourself constantly saying things like " Did you go ? Did you go ? " or " Honey , did he go when you had him ? " Children overhear this and it can make them more anxious and resistant , Schfer says . Look at the underlying reason for your son 's reluctance and try to address it without making it a big issue . Q How do I know when my son is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your son might be ready to ditch his diapers is if he remains relatively dry after a two-hour nap , or if he shows you he 's aware of the fact he 's about to go ( and not just that he already went ) . " There 's no sense inviting him to the toilet until you see some kind of holding , like doing the peepee dance , which shows he 's figured out those muscles , " says Schfer . " Children need to develop that physical sensation and awareness of having to pee to be successful at toilet training . " Once you think your son might be ready , start introducing him to the idea slowly . Let him watch you in the bathroom , buy a potty and pick up a children 's potty-training book . Letting him just sit on the toilet ( clothed or otherwise ) for a minute or two before bath time will help make it part of the routine and seem less scary . " Make it relaxed and fun , " Schfer says . And do n't rush it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the earlier you start , the later you 'll finish . " Q Daytime dryness is no problem for our four-year-old daughter , but nighttime is a different story . Is there anything we can do to help her stay dry at night ? A Nighttime dryness can remain elusive for months or even years after a child has successfully mastered staying dry during the day , says Greig . " Some children are just really deep sleepers , while others ' bladders take longer to mature . " To avoid emergency bedding changes in the wee hours , try keeping drinks to a minimum a few hours before bedtime and make sure your daughter empties her bladder completely before tucking her in . Some parents , when they go to bed themselves , will also wake their children so they can squeeze in one last trip to the bathroom . You can also try " lifting " your child - a process that involves waking her every night around 3 a.m. for an additional trek to the toilet . " But it can take months or years for nighttime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up at 3 a.m. for that length of time , " says Greig . A simple plastic sheet under the bedsheet might be the most convenient alternative for all concerned . You can also keep your daughter in a diaper at night , but encourage her to use the toilet if she has to and let her know it 's OK to call for help .
