<p> For the past month almost everyone associated with the US-led occupation of Iraq has been focused on the June 30 handover . Town-hall meetings are held across Iraq explaining the interim government 's powers and Coalition Provisional Authority staffers scuttle about the fortified Green Zone , preparing to hand over their jobs to State Department officials , planning vacations , and looking for new jobs . <p> But for most Iraqis the changing of the political guard comes down to one question : Will greater sovereignty mean more security ? " This could be a big improvement if we really do get sovereignty and the power on our own to deal with the terrorists , " says Sheikh Mohammed Bakar al-Suhel , chairman of the Baghdad City Council . " But we 're going to have to see . " <p> The preturnover signs are not encouraging . Thursday , there was more evidence that insurgents have regrouped and are intensifying their attacks . At least 66 Iraqis and three US soldiers were killed in attacks in six Iraqi cities , in an arc of violence stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern city of Mosul , 300 miles away . <p> A group led by Jordanian Abu Musab Zarqawi , who has links to Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement on an Islamist Website . The violence primarily targeted Iraqis who the US hope will take a broader and more vigorous security role after the handover . <p> In the increasingly unstable northern city of Mosul , coordinated car bombs hit two Iraqi police stations , a police academy and a local hospital , killing at least 44 ; car bombs also hit police stations in the Sunni triangle town of Ramadi ; in Baquba , government buildings were attacked and two US soldiers were killed in firefights with insurgents ; and in Baghdad , a bomb at a checkpoint killed three Iraqi soldiers and one US soldier . <p> Thursday , the CPA relinquished control of the last 11 of 25 ministries , which now oversee more than 1 million government workers . <p> Iraqis , both officials and average citizens , say the most important dividend of any handover would be greater security , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began soon after Baghdad fell last year . Iraqi police , facing insurgents and well-organized and armed criminal gangs , have been reluctant to do much more than direct traffic until now . <p> Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi , a former exile with close ties to both the CIA and former Baath generals , has promised a tough line against crime and the insurgency , mooting a declaration of martial law after he takes power . " Our No. 1 priority is security , " says Imad al-Shibib , an Iraqi military officer who fled into exile in 1990 and now heads the political bureau of Mr. Allawi 's party , the Iraqi National Accord . " We have people who know how to handle this . " <p> For now , US forces will run most anti-insurgent operations . " I do n't think that July 1st is a particularly significant date for coalition military operations , " said Brig . Gen. Mark Kimmitt , a coalition military spokesman . Military operations are not going to change dramatically " the way it is dramatically changing politically on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will be some time before those Iraqi security forces can take on the burden and the responsibility . " <p> Evidence of that has been the failure of a US experiment in the Sunni Triangle town of Fallujah , where an Iraqi brigade was put in charge after an April offensive against insurgents there left hundreds of residents dead and severely undercut Iraqi tolerance for the occupation . <p> US soldiers say the so-called Fallujah Brigade has done little to root out insurgents there , particularly the foreign fighters close to Zarqawi that the US alleges have been using the town as a base for attacks across the country . The Korean translator Kim Sun-Il was kidnapped and later beheaded near Fallujah by men who claimed to be with Zarqawi 's Tawhid and Jihad Group . Reuters reported Thursday that men in the Baquba attack wore headbands identifying them as members of the Tawhid and Jihad battalion . <p> The power of Allawi to act as a strong leader remains to be seen , with the structure of the Iraqi government designed to tie his hands when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations were worried that an appointed Iraqi prime minister with wide powers could pose a threat to fair and democratic elections . <p> " After 30 years of living under Saddam 's tyranny , it is perfectly understandable that the Iraqi people would seek to limit the power of a government that is not yet fully accountable to the Iraqi electorate , " Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday . <p> But in practice , that will mean Allawi will need to build a consensus among Iraq 's fractious and divided political groups to get things done . Major initiatives will need not only the approval of a 31-member council of ministers drawn up to reflect Iraqi 's religious , sectarian , and political divides , but will also require the unanimous approval of the three-member presidency . <p> A two-thirds majority of a 100-member advisory council that will be set up in July could also veto any legislation . This group will also be widely representative ; the 20 members of the now defunct Iraqi Governing Council have been guaranteed seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be guided by Ambassador Paul Bremer 's blueprint . A senior coalition officials says that Mr. Bremer 's executive orders will stand unless expressly repealed . As a result , the CPA is pushing to finish legislation for Bremer 's signature before the 30th , including an update of CPA Order 17 , which gives coalition forces broad powers inside Iraq and immunity from civilian prosecution - and will also serve as the major limit on Iraq 's sovereignty . <p> In practice , Allawi will have to govern with the consent of the US , since it will remain the major financier of reconstruction and will have the most effective security apparatus inside the country . " In theory , there are things that Allawi could try to do , but in practice , he knows he needs the US , " says a CPA official . " I do n't anticipate many conflicts . " <p> Most Iraqis say they 're less concerned with the legal grounds of the handover and are much more interested in whether it will work . Their attitude towards the interim government now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary but willing to give it a chance to make their lives better . <p> As the months dragged on with rising violence , and few tangible signs of improving quality of life , acceptance of the CPA was transformed into outright rejection . A CPA poll in May found that just 11 percent of Iraqis outside Kurdistan had confidence in the CPA , and 10 percent had confidence in US-led forces . That was down from 32 percent and 28 percent , respectively , in January . <p> US officials say part of the problem until now has been the reluctance of Iraqi forces to act at the behest of a foreign power . They expect an Iraq led by Allawi will be one in which police and new Army units will be more willing to take on insurgents and criminals . <p> " It is clear that the members of the security forces , most of whom are Iraqi patriots , need an Iraqi rallying point , " Mr. Wolfowitz said Tuesday . " They need to understand they report to an Iraqi chain of command , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted Iraqi government . " <p> But many Iraqis are skeptical that there will be much change . A statement on an Islamist website attributed to Zarqawi dismissed the incoming government as " those that stand with the Americans , " and urged Iraqis to rise up against the interim government . While that is n't likely , the reason most police give for not patrolling more aggressively - fear of attack - shows no indication of changing yet . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
