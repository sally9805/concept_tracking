Hon'ami Koetsu , the Japanese artist , is scarcely known in the U.S. , but in Japan he is a national treasure several times over  --  about as famous there as Benvenuto Cellini is in the West . This is because he was one of the supreme masters of calligraphy , an art that matters only to specialists on the American side of the Pacific but is wholly central to Japanese and Chinese aesthetics . It 's understandable , therefore , that the present show of Koetsu 's work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art , though respectably attended , has not been packing in the crowds . This is a boon for those who go to see it . The fewer people looking over your shoulder when you 're looking at one of Koetsu 's exquisite moments in ink , the better . It would n't be as private as this in a Japanese museum . <P> There is an inverse relationship between the size of Koetsu 's work and the scale of his cultural resonance . These tiny , fugitive-looking images , in which luminous fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undulation of a flock of cranes  --  were painted in colored inks on handmade paper by his collaborator Tawaraya Sotatsu and then written over by Koetsu , have acquired , for Japanese taste , the sort of cardinal importance that a fresco cycle or an altarpiece might have for ours . Koetsu 's work , given the accumulated Japanese reactions to it , is perhaps the ultimate example of the power of the small , the exquisite , the almost marginal . <P> Koetsu died at 79 in 1637 , laden with the esteem of patrons and connoisseurs . He was a devotee of beauty and had given over his life to art with the degree of throwaway fanaticism that entails a horror of self-importance . Koetsu was not a professional artist . He raised amateurism to an extreme level . The rougher and more summary his work , the greater its appeal to the cultivated . He has always been associated with the " Renaissance " of the city of Kyoto , then Japan 's capital , after the ferociously destructive civil wars of the 16th century , when Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Italians thought their Renaissance was an upwelling of disciplined classicism  --  Rome reborn from the ashes of " barbarous " Gothic  --  so the Kyoto Renaissance strove to recall the spirit of the Japanese past , as far back as the Heian era ( 794-1185 ) , especially in the domain of writing . It produced an intensely elitist , nobly disciplined and masculine culture whose emblems were the ink brush , the samurai sword and the tea bowl . <P> It is not certain how Koetsu managed to find a place within this society as one of its principal tastemakers  --  as , in a sense , its artistic director . The role was n't a complete sinecure : the ruling warlord , Tokugawa Ieyasu , ordered the seppuku , or ritual suicide , of one of Koetsu 's circle , the tea master Furuta Oribe , for some real or imagined disloyalty . But Koetsu ended his days in dignified security , as the quasi-religious head of a community at Takagamine , near Kyoto , part artists ' colony and part monkish village .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
