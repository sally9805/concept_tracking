Chapter One Terrace View Asylum , Delaware January 1967 " So , Jamie , you 've had a few weeks to adjust to Terrace View . How do you like it so far ? " Dr. McDevitt looked at the young man seated in front of his desk . A small , well-built young man who might have been handsome had it not been for his gauntness , the listlessness of his posture , the shadows around his shifting eyes . He kept wringing his hands together . " It 's okay , " Jamie answered , not looking up . Dr. McDevitt was n't insulted at Jamie 's shrug , implying a well-run sanitarium was n't any better than that state institutional hellhole , Eastern State , where he 'd been for the last few months . Right now the young man probably could n't tell one place from another . After all , he only recently could remember his name . And the brutal way he had been transferred here ... Dr. McDevitt was sure it had set his progress back for weeks . " Grenville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember Grenville Hawkes ? " Jamie shook his head . " You used to work for him-he wanted to make sure you received the best treatment . Do you remember working for Grenville Hawkes , back in Hawkes Harbor ? " Dr. McDevitt thought he discerned a small flinch in Jamie 's posture , but there was no change in tone , as he said , " No . " Dr. McDevitt glanced across the scanty medical report . Some doctor from Eastern State , who forgot to sign his name , had made a note that this was one of the worst cases of depression he 'd ever tried to treat-it was no doubt a major cause of the amnesia . In the beginning , the patient would wake having no memory of the day before , would literally forget his own name by afternoon . Some memory of his early life was now returning , the report stated . Not much to go on , but Eastern State was a place of housing , not treatment . Dr. McDevitt wished he had more background . Jamie had been transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her grandfather Johnas Kahne had founded and still technically ruled Terrace View . ( The commonly held view , and joke , was that the esteemed Dr. Kahne wanted to make sure his progeny had a place to live ; and out of all his swarm of eccentric descendants , this granddaughter was perhaps the most likely candidate . ) " Money is no problem , " Louisa had insisted when she called demanding a room . " A favor for a friend of mine , Grenville Hawkes . Jamie 'll be arriving some day this week . Yes , yes , I know , you 're not accustomed to patients from the criminally insane ward at Eastern State , but crazy is crazy , after all . " No other instructions . Only a short note , and the deposit from Grenville Hawkes , followed in the mail . Dr. McDevitt had decided to treat him on his own . There were no other instructions , recommendations . Apparently his benefactors were content if he 'd just sit here , abandoned like some stray dropped off at a shelter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first .... Dr. McDevitt still remembered the horrible beginning of Jamie Sommers 's stay at Terrace View . It had gone to his heart when the young man turned to him . " Dr. McDevitt , the new patient 's here . James Sommers . " " Is Miss Kahne showing him to his room ? " " No , Miss Kahne 's not with him . He 's in a police car . He wo n't get out . And the officer is getting threatening . " Dr. McDevitt ran outside with Nurse Whiting . Yes , it was a police car . And an officer trying to talk sports with Lee . The attendant looked grim . No one without compassion was allowed to work at Terrace View . " Hey , you want to get this nutcase outta my patrol car ? " was the officer 's greeting to the doctor . " I ca n't get Nurse Nancy here to help haul him . " Dr. McDevitt went to the car . The back doors were open , no one visible . He leaned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Dear God , they 'd put him in a straitjacket . There were shackles on his ankles . There was no mention of violence on his hospital record . " Mr. Sommers , " he said . Jamie slowly raised his head . Young , thin , unshaven , dirty . And madness in his eyes . " If you 'll let me help you out , I 'll remove your restraints . I 'm sure they must be painful . " The man was still recovering from some very serious physical injuries . Louisa had attempted to gloss over that fact , but Jamie 's medical records had preceded his arrival . " Captain Harvard ? " Jamie said uncertainly . He looked puzzled , hopeful . " May I help you ? " " Sure , " Jamie said . It was the last time he spoke for several days . He was improving , now . He slept on his bed , not under it . He startled far too easily , but jumped , no longer screamed . Still suffered from night terrors . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take credit for a lot of that , the doctor suspected ) but let Nurse Whiting trim his hair . He was settled enough in his new surroundings for a first session . Dr. McDevitt looked over the report once more . Interesting case , a kind they rarely got at Terrace View . A criminal , apparently ( Dr. McDevitt had a copy of Jamie 's police record as well as his medical reports ) , shot during a suspected kidnapping . Dr. McDevitt winced as he read about the three bullets being surgically removed-God knew what kind of treatment Jamie 'd received after leaving Hawkes Harbor Hospital for Eastern State . The doctor had heard stories about the infirmary there . " Well , Jamie , my records show you are twenty-five years of age ? " " Sounds right . " " Raised in St. Catherine 's Orphanage , Bronx , attended Billingsworth High , Bronx , three years in the navy ... " Dr. McDevitt paused-but Jamie did n't confirm any of it . Eastern State had suggested Jamie 's memory of his early life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than knowing his name . He watched with interest as Jamie 's eyes went to the window . Dr. McDevitt had chosen this time of day for the interview with reason . Jamie shifted in his chair , looked around for a clock , gripped his hands together , wiped them on his pants . Twenty-five . Dr. McDevitt would have guessed him slightly older-sun had burned lines into his face , pain had stamped dark circles under his eyes . " Did you like the navy ? " " Liked getting my third mate 's papers . They 're real handy . " " It gives no reason for your early discharge . " " I got sick of taking orders . " " There 's no report of any discipline problem on your previous hospital record . " " Do n't want no trouble . " Jamie slumped down again . His eyes went back to the window . He swallowed . " You know what time it is ? " he asked . " Sixish . Your former employer , Mr. Hawkes , gave us a glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any wrongdoing . " Jamie looked confused . " I 'm referring to your ... mishap with the Hawkes Harbor police . " " I did n't hurt anybody . " Jamie 's voice rose . " I know he shot me , but he did n't need to , I was n't hurting anybody . " " It 's all right , Jamie , " Dr. McDevitt said . " All criminal charges have been dropped . " There had been no evidence with which to charge him . In fact , when the doctor looked at the report , his first thought was to wonder why the lawman had thought it worthwhile to gun down an unarmed man on a mere suspicion . Must have been a slow day in Hawkes Harbor . " You do n't remember the shooting ? Or what led up to it ? " " I remember waking up after . " Jamie rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand . That was on the report-prone to severe mood swings , cried easily , bouts of hysteria ... " It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . " It 's getting dark . Usually , I get a pill about now ... " " Of course . In just a moment . " The medical report emphasized the patient 's extreme distress at twilight-unless heavily sedated he would not sleep at all at night . And even then , was subject to violent nightmares . And all that had certainly been borne out during these first few weeks at Terrace View . " That 's an interesting scar you have there . " " W-w-what ? " Jamie went white . He clamped his left hand over his throat . " There ai n't nothin ' there . " " I mean the one that looks like a burn ? From your shoulder down to your elbow . " Jamie pushed up the short sleeve of his white T-shirt to look , exposing a tattoo of a well-endowed mermaid on his bicep . And to Dr. McDevitt 's total surprise , Jamie laughed . " Hey , that ? Shark got me . Got another scar at the same time . From my ass to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Hell no , my arm would be gone if it 'd bit me . It was a twelve-foot tiger . No , it just rubbed me good . Maybe it was a lady shark , like Kell said ... they got hide worse than sandpaper . Took all the skin right off . " " And you find this shark attack humorous ? " " Well , the pirates thought it was funny , that 's the important thing . And I thought ol ' Kell was going to bust a gut laughing . Said he 'd never seen anyone swim so fast . " Dr. McDevitt sighed . There had been no mention in his records of these fantasies .... " The pirates ? " he inquired . " Yeah , we were in the Andamans , smuggling rubies out of Burma .... " Seeing the doctor 's puzzled look , Jamie added politely , " The Andaman Sea , south of the Bay of Bengal-west of Bangkok ? East of Sri Lanka ? " He appeared to be slightly shocked at the doctor 's lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sunlight had disappeared . " I think maybe I better get a pill- " He jumped up and paced . " Sharks got real dead eyes , " he said rapidly . " You ever see one up close ? Got dead eyes , you 're kinda surprised they 're breathin ' .... I seen dead eyes , though , burnin ' like fires of hell .... Oh God , it 's getting dark ... do n't let it be dark .... " Dr. McDevitt took a deep breath . He was witnessing what he 'd only been told of before-Jamie 's hysteria at sunset . " There 's nothing to be afraid of in the dark , " he soothed . " The hell there ai n't ! " Jamie was rapidly losing control . He looked around wildly , as if for an escape . " Bad stuff happens when it 's dark . God , what 's gon na happen now ? Now what ? God , " he cried , " it 's too late . It 's dark . It 's already dark . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an orderly and an injection . As rapidly as Jamie 's hysteria was escalating , a pill would take too long . " What bad stuff , Jamie ? " " You know . I ca n't stop it ! " He paced , his eyes wild and empty . " I ca n't do nothin ' about it ! I 'm too tired . " His voice trailed off into a sob . " I 'm too tired ... " " Jamie , " said the doctor , " you 're going to need an injection now . I 'm going to try not to be late with your medication again . " " Do n't hurt me . " Jamie gripped the back of his chair . " Please . " Lee advanced with the hypodermic ; Jamie offered no resistance . The orderly left , and Jamie slumped back into his chair . His eyes gradually dulled as the tranquilizers took effect . His breathing returned to normal . Something nagged at the doctor 's memory . Yes , here it was in the police record-Jamie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of this story be true ? He shuffled through the papers , found a worn and well-stamped passport . " Hey , " Jamie said . " That 's m-m-mine . " " Of course it is , Jamie . We 're just keeping it for you . You can have it back . " " Okay , " he muttered . " But do n't lose it . I never lost a passport . Kell said I was the only person he knew who never lost a passport .... You know , Kell had a U.S. passport , but he was n't a citizen ... he was Irish . But he had a couple . Knew where to get good fakes . " " So , Jamie , sometime will you tell me about your shark attack and the Burmese pirates ? " " Yeah . Wish Kell was here , though . He could tell a story . We had drinks on the house every time .... " Jamie 's voice trailed off drowsily . Dr. McDevitt called for an orderly , and Jamie left docilely for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always schedule Jamie 's sessions in the mornings . It would probably be a while before he was weaned from the strong evening sedation . Once the young man had gone , the doctor could n't help glancing at the darkened window . Interesting story , yet how much of what he said was true ? The doctor suddenly looked away , wondering what the dark could contain that could terrify a man who had faced Burmese pirates . Who laughed at sharks . * * * Andaman Sea March 1964 " Well , Jamie , if you do n't hurry and get that engine started , we 'll cook . " " I 'm working as fast as I can . It 's hard to breathe down here . Anyway , you want it done right , don'tchya ? " Jamie came up from the engine room . He was dripping sweat . He was wearing only a pair of cotton draw-string pants , but they were soaked and clinging to him and he seriously considered taking them off , too . It was easily 100 degrees , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand of the beach and cove , added to the heat . He could use a swim anyway . First , a cigarette . Jamie sat down at the table under the boat 's awning and tapped a cigarette out of the package that lay there . " Whoever thought this tub was a pleasure boat did n't know what pleasure was , " he remarked . It was a nice little one-cabin cruiser , or had been once . Fifteen years and a lot of rough use had changed it considerably . " Well now , Jamie , we can be buyin ' our own yachts , now , ca n't we ? This tub got us out of Rangoon , and it 'll get us to Sri Lanka . That 's all that 's needed . " Kellen Quinn sat idly in the seat behind the wheel . Other than constantly adding up how much money they 'd have waiting for them in Bangkok , there was n't much else he could do at this point . Jamie picked up a water jug and took a small , careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were starting to watch the water supply . " You can fix it , ca n't you , lad ? " " Yeah . Do n't worry . " He rubbed at the gold stubble on his chin . It showed up glittering against his tan . His normally dark blond hair was striped gold with sun and salt ; his hazel eyes looked almost yellow in his tanned face . Jamie Sommers was twenty-one years old and he was very , very rich , if he could get to some place where he could spend his money . " It 's a good thing I got those spare plugs . " Jamie had insisted on a few parts , once he got a look at the boat that was supposed to get them to Sri Lanka . Parts were harder to find on the black market than rubies , but rubies were n't going to run a boat . Buy a yacht . Now there was a good idea . Jamie put the dangerous escape from Rangoon out of his mind , letting it wander to how to spend his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week-long drunks and very pretty ladies-adding a yacht to that mix was a good idea . He picked up the worn leather bag that lay on the table . Very carefully-Kell had fits about the pearls getting scratched , but there sure had n't been time to do any fancy packaging-he slid the contents onto the table . Pearls . Jade . Rubies . After two years , it was apparent General NeWin 's socialist government was n't working ; most people thought sooner or later it would collapse . Meanwhile , the black market in Burma was a trader 's market , medicine , cooking pots , even soap more valuable than pretty stones-A score waiting to happen for a thinking man like Kellen Quinn , an acting man like Jamie Sommers . " This one 's mine , right ? " Jamie held up an 8-carat , teardrop ruby . He liked the rubies the best . Pearls and jade were pale next to rubies . Kell had taught him how to judge jewels-the clarity and color to this one was breathtaking . This one was a keeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash . It made him feel good just to look at it . Yeah , he was keeping this one . " I told you after you downed that armed guard , whichever one you want . " Kell watched Jamie hold the stone up to the sun . In truth , Kell was the more amenable to this because , as valuable as it was , the ruby was not the rarest of the gems . Several of the very old jade pieces were worth twice as much . And the artifacts-the poor kid showed no interest at all in the artifacts , and they were worth more than the rest together . ( Continues ... )
