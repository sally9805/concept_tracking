Prologue RESURRECTION The Hospital , somewhere in Maryland At about eleven in the evening , Dr. Ethan Kane trudged down the gray-and-blue-painted corridor toward a private elevator . His mind was filled with images of death and suffering , but also progress , great progress that would change the world . A young and quite homely scrub nurse rounded the corner of the passageway and nodded her head deferentially as she approached him . She had a crush on Dr. Kane , and she was n't the only one . " Doctor , " she said , " you 're still working . " " Esther , you go home , now . Please , " Ethan Kane said , pretending to be solicitous and caring , which could n't have been further from the truth . He considered the nurse inferior in every way , including the fact that she was female . He was also exhausted from a surgical marathon : five major operations in a day . The elevator car finally arrived , the doors slid open , and he stepped inside . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse a lot of very white teeth , but no genuine warmth , because there was none to show . He straightened his tall body and wearily passed his hand over his longish blond hair , cleaned his wire-rimmed glasses on the tail of his lab coat , then rubbed his eyes before putting his glasses back on as hedescended to the subbasement level . One more thing to check on ... always one more thing to do . He walked half a dozen quick steps to a thick steel door and pushed it open with the palm of his hand . He entered the dark and chilly atmosphere of a basement storage room . A pungent odor struck him . There , lying on a double row of gurneys , were six naked bodies . Four men , two women , all in their late teens and early twenties . Each was brain-dead , each as good as gone , but each had served a worthy cause , a higher purpose . The plastic bracelets on their wrists said DONOR . " You 're making the world a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take comfort in that . " Dr. Kane strode to the far end of the room and pushed open another steel door , an exact duplicate of the first . This time rather than a chilly blast , he was met by a searing wave of hot air , the deafening roar of fire , and the unmistakable smell of death . All three incinerators were going tonight . Two of his nighttime porters , their powerful workingman bodies glistening with grime and sweat , looked up as Dr. Kane entered the cinder-block chamber . The men nodded respectfully , but their eyes showed fear . " Let 's pick up the pace , gentlemen . This is taking too long , " Kane called out . " Let 's go , let 's go ! You 're being paid well for this scut work . Too well . " He glanced at a naked young woman 's corpse laid out on the cement floor . She was white-blond , pretty in a music-video sort of way . The porters had probably been diddling with her . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurneys were shoved haphazardly into one corner , like discarded shopping carts in a supermarket parking lot . Quite a spectacle . Hellish , to be sure . As he watched , one of the sweat-glazed minions worked a wooden paddle under a young male 's body while the other swung open the heavy glass door of an oven . Together they pushed , shoved , slid the body into the fire as if it were a pizza . The flames dampened for a moment , then as the porters locked down the door , the inferno flared again . The cremation chamber was called a " retort . " Each retort burned at 3,600 degrees , and it took just over fifteen minutes to reduce a human body to nothing but ashes . To Dr. Ethan Kane , that meant one thing : no evidence of what was happening at the Hospital . Absolutely no evidence of Resurrection . " Pick up the pace ! " he yelled again . " Burn these bodies ! " The donors . ( Continues ... )        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
