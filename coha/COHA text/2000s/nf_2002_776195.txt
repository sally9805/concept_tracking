Chapter Two // " At this second appearing ... " // At this second appearing , to take the oath of the presidential office , there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first . Then a statement , somewhat in detail , of a course to be pursued , seemed fitting and proper . Now , at the expiration of four years , during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention , and engrosses the enerergies sic of the nation , little that is new could be presented . The progress of our arms , upon which all else chiefly depends , is as well known to the public as to myself ; and it is , I trust , reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all . With high hope for the future , no prediction in regard to it is ventured . // Lincoln 's opening words , " At this second appearing , " are not a throwaway line . Lincoln almost did not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political pundits had predicted that he would be another of the one-term presidents that had become customary in the middle years of the nineteenth century . In the days before March 4 , 1865 , in a federal government that was only seventy-six years old , American as well as foreign newspapers much commented that this would be the first time in thirty-two years that a president would be inaugurated for a second term . // The Republican Party had been cobbled together in 1854 from Whig , Free Soil , Democratic , and other parties and interests . Lincoln , who had served only a single term in the House of Representatives in the late 1840s , had first attracted national attention in 1858 as a result of his performance in his debates with Senator Stephen Douglas in Illinois . // Lincoln trailed William Seward 1731/2 to 102 , with Salmon Chase third , on the first ballot for presidential candidate at the 1860 Republican convention . Seward , a senator and former governor from New York , and Chase , the governor of Ohio , were both better-known politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate on the third ballot . Critics were quick to point out that the nominating convention was held at Chicago , in Lincoln 's home state of Illinois . ( On the eve of his second inauguration , the New York Herald reminded its readers that Lincoln was elected " as a one-term compromise " by " cliques " within his party . ) Ever after , politicians gossiped that the relatively unknown Lincoln was put forward as an available compromise candidate in 1860. // * * * // In the midst of the elation of Lincoln 's second inauguration , many could remember back a scant seven months to a quite different mood . In the summer of 1864 , many of Lincoln 's supporters were resigned to his having only one term . A mood of desolation pervaded the White House . Lincoln appeared weary , his lanky frame visibly sagging under the burdens of the presidency . Just a year after the decisive summer victories of ' 63 at Gettysburg and Vicksburg , the summer of 1864 witnessed campaigns that brought disappointment , even despair , throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's Eastern campaign by confidently leading nearly a hundred thousand men against Lee 's sixty-five thousand soldiers in the Battle of the Wilderness . In the fighting that lay ahead , at Spotsylvania and at Cold Harbor , Virginia , Grant would suffer almost sixty thousand casualties  --  nearly the equal of the troops Lee put in the field . By the end of seven weeks of battles and skirmishes , the Northern public began to ask if victory was worth the swelling cost in human lives . // As casualties escalated in the North , the cumulative effect of more than three years of war began taking its effect on the president , politicians , and the populace . Lincoln barely slept during the first week of the Battle of the Wilderness . Sherman was marching toward Atlanta , but the city still remained in rebel control . There were long silences when no one was quite sure of the progress of Sherman 's campaign . Although Grant stood before Richmond , the reputation of Lee and his troops was still respected , if not feared . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , casualty counts of two thousand a day were slackening the will to fight on . // With no major victories for more than a year now , weariness seemed to be winning out . Some Democrats began to press for a negotiated settlement to end the carnage . Even as the North was getting used to finding new generals to lead the war effort , some Republicans began to suggest it was time to find a new candidate for the presidential election coming in November 1864. // Lincoln was receiving pessimistic reports from his advisers about his prospects for re-election . Henry J. Raymond , founder of the New York Times and chairman of the Republican National Committee , convened the committee at the Astor House in New York on August 22 . Raymond , a moderate Republican , had always been emphatic that the moral issue of slavery should be subordinated to the practical questions of political power . He admired Lincoln but had not been enthusiastic about the Emancipation Proclamation . // In early August 1864 , after canvassing the situation with members representing all the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Lincoln that even if an election were " to be held now in Illinois we should be beaten . " Simon Cameron , a key Pennsylvania leader and Lincoln 's former secretary of war , reported , " Pennsylvania is against us . " Raymond in turn declared that New York " would go 50,000 against us tomorrow . " // Why this dismal turn of events ? Raymond , a friend and supporter of the president , wrote frankly about what he believed to be the problem : " the want of military successes , and the impression in some minds , the fear and suspicion in others , that we are not to have peace in any event under this Administration until Slavery is abandoned . " Lincoln , for so long accused by abolitionists and radicals within his own party of going too slowly on slavery , was being indicted for holding his ground on the moral imperative of first restraining but now removing slavery . In sum , Raymond told Lincoln , " the tide is setting strongly against us. " // Lincoln became resigned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , 1864 , six days before the Demo-cratic convention would select his opponent , he wrote a private memorandum expressing his feelings . " This morning , as for some days past , it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be re-elected . Then it will be my duty to so cooperate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration ; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he can not possibly save it afterwards . " // Lincoln brought his private memorandum to the Cabinet meeting that afternoon . He presented it to his colleagues , folded so that none of the text was visible , and asked each of them to sign the back of the document . // This mood of pessimism changed dramatically when news reached the North that Atlanta was evacuated on September l and that Sherman had led his troops into the city on September 2 . A revival of Unionist fervor began to sweep through the North . Lincoln 's spirits were buoyed . The change in the fortunes of battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General George McClellan , an overwhelming victory in electoral votes , 221 to 21 for McClellan . Lincoln received 2,203,831 votes to McClellan 's 1,797,019 votes . He would approach his second inauguration vindicated personally , and expecting victory in the field . // * * * // Lincoln began his address in a subdued tone . In the highly charged atmosphere of wartime Washington , with soldiers everywhere , it is as if he wanted to lower anticipations . In the first , third , and fifth sentences of this first paragraph , Lincoln lowered them with the key words " less ... little ... no. " // He started more like an observer than the main actor . The language of the first paragraph is impersonal . Yes , he used the pronouns " I " and " myself , " but the ethos of the paragraph was unemotional . Lincoln directed the focus of his remarks away from himself by speaking in a passive voice . Avoiding the active voice set up a paradigm that Lincoln followed throughout the address . After this first paragraph , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one with the usual contents of such an address . In the first sentence he said that this was not the occasion for " an extended address . " In the second sentence he reiterated why a detailed " statement " was proper four years before , but not today . In the third sentence he reminded the audience that on many other occasions they had heard " public declarations " on " every point and phase " of the war , implying that he would not make such a declaration on this occasion . The audience surely would have relished hearing the commander-in-chief give a report on " the progress of our arms , " but he would not do that . // After Lincoln told the audience everything the speech would not be , he concluded the first paragraph by announcing he was offering " no prediction " about the end of the war . The problem , as Lincoln realized , was that predictions had been made all too often in the first years of the war . Predictions led to false optimism that had again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in Lincoln 's beginning paragraph that would arouse the passions of the audience . The opening , unlike either the First Inaugural or the Gettysburg Address , contains no creative stylistic flourishes . When we first hear or read the beginning words of Lincoln 's Second Inaugural , they may even come upon us as awkward , if not ungraceful. // In these initial words Lincoln did not seem to build bridges to the aspirations of his Union audience . The audience was surely waiting to hear the re-elected president give voice to their feelings of victory , with the end of the war in sight . His supporters hoped he would speak of the personal vindication of being re-elected . Lincoln 's beginning seems , at first glance , to undercut the grand opportunity of a second inaugural address . After thirty-two years during which no president had been elected for a second term , Lincoln could only muster : " At this second appearing . " // * * * // The text of the Second Inaugural consists of 703 words . Lincoln arranged his words in twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the address are of one syllable . // Lincoln 's pattern was to read his addresses slowly . He usually spoke barely more than one hundred words per minute . At this rate , even incorporating applause , it probably took him only six or seven minutes to deliver the Second Inaugural Address . // We have the record of but a single voice reporting on the composition of the text . Francis B. Carpenter , an artist who spent six months in residence at the White House , related a conversation with Lincoln on the previous Sunday evening , February 26 . Carpenter was sitting in Lincoln 's office in the Executive Mansion with two men from New York and Ohio who had arrived for an appointment with the president . He reported that the president came in by a side passage , only recently constructed , " holding in his hand a roll of manuscripts . " Upon encountering Carpenter , the president exclaimed , " Lots of wisdom in that document , I suspect . It is what will be called my second inaugural , containing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer until I want it . " Then , seating himself by the fire , Lincoln spoke of the old days in Illinois . // The fact that Lincoln put the Second Inaugural in his drawer six days in advance of its delivery matches what we know about his writing . Lincoln took great pains in preparing his most important public addresses . Before his House Divided Speech ( 1858 ) and Cooper Union Address ( 1860 ) , all his speeches were extemporaneous , sometimes aided by notes . As president , despite his reputation as an effective stump speaker , Lincoln did not trust himself in spontaneous situations where he was suddenly called upon to speak . More and more he declined these invitations . When he knew he was to present an important speech , he toiled far ahead . // In the Executive Mansion , Lincoln usually wrote his speeches first with pencil on stiff sheets of white pasteboard or boxboard . Noah Brooks tells of observing Lincoln writing in his armchair , his favorite position , with his legs crossed . He laid the sheets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . He crossed out words and edited until the text was ready to copy as the final version of the speech to be delivered . // Although comfortable in a solitary approach to writing , Lincoln was not above seeking the opinions and editing of others . In preparing the First Inaugural , he received the help of a number of colleagues , especially Secretary of State-Elect William Seward . // We do not know about any editors in the construction of the Second Inaugural . Given Lincoln 's own estimate that the length of the address was six hundred words as of February 26 , it may be that he continued to revise and add . We have no record of his continuing efforts . // The Second Inaugural Address was handwritten in two columns on what was called foolscap , a form of paper approximately thirteen and a half by seventeen inches in size . The handwritten text reveals that Lincoln made only three corrections to the original text ( see appendix I ) . The draft of the address was then set in type , the galley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " text " comes from the Greek root teks , which means " to weave . " " Text " suggests " textile , " or a fabric woven with many strands . Behind the printed text is an intricate weaving of meaning . Even when we refer to Lincoln 's pruning down his earlier , more bombastic speech to the plainer style of Gettysburg or the Second Inaugural , " plain " is not meant to connote simple . Lincoln was chided early on in his presidency as a " Simple Susan , " suggesting that his plain talk and one-syllable words had little meaning . Yes , the text of the Second Inaugural is in mostly one-syllable words , but the brilliance of Lincoln 's words is in the weaving . // Lincoln wrote primarily to be heard . He crafted his speeches as much for the ear as for the eye . Of course he expected his fellow citizens would read the address , often weeks or even months later , but this did not take away from his desire to craft a speech to be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text , take the six to seven minutes required to read the address . Even better , speak it aloud , slowly , as Lincoln surely had done . Hear the way this weaving of meaning sounds to the ear . // * * * // As the audience was listening to the beginning paragraph , Lincoln saw his speech whole . In this first paragraph he was putting into place a pattern of organization for the full speech . He established an alignment divided into past , present , and future time . These three time tenses would become one of the organizing structures of the whole speech . // Lincoln 's major addresses , including the House Divided Speech , the Cooper Union Address , and the Gettysburg Address , all possess what rhetorician Michael Leff calls " temporal markers . " This same design is present in the Second Inaugural . Lincoln 's use of time directs the rhetorical movement of each of these speeches . // One of the problems in analyzing any of these speeches has been the tendency to focus upon only one unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This tendency has only increased as television coverage has focused on only one passage or even only one sentence . The House Divided Speech in 1858 actually invoked the ire of many Republicans , who believed Lincoln was predicting a civil war . Lincoln was upset that they had not read the whole speech . The remembrance of the Second Inaugural has tended to emphasize two sections . The quotation used most frequently is the opening words of the last paragraph : " with malice toward none ; with charity for all . " Since the 1960s , the civil-rights struggle has focused more attention on the issue of slavery . Thus , in recent years , the forceful sentence from the third paragraph that begins , " If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences , " has been emphasized . // The problem with an analysis that focuses on one or two passages in a speech is that the framework of the whole is ignored . Most often the last paragraph of the Second Inaugural is quoted without reference to the whole , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand Lincoln 's strategy for the complete speech . // * * * // We may ask , what were the expectations of second inaugural addresses ? Granting the distinctiveness of March 4 , 1865 , how do Lincoln 's words compare with the beginning paragraphs of other second inaugurals ? // George Washington , in 1793 , delivered the shortest second inaugural , 135 words . Washington did not deliver a speech . He simply acknowledged his re-election . // Thomas Jefferson , in 1805 , began his Second Inaugural Address in an upbeat manner : " It is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow-citizens at large , and the zeal with which it inspires me to conduct . " Jefferson struck a note of confidence , surely a motif that Lincoln could lift up at the beginning of his Second Inaugural . // James Madison , in 1813 , sounded two notes that would become commonplace in most succeeding second inaugural addresses : the confidence of the electorate in the re-elected president , and the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked the people for the " evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge my arduous duties have been favorably estimated , " and pointed to " the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed . " // James Monroe , in 1821 , glowed with self-assurance as he began his Second Inaugural Address . " I shall not attempt to describe the grateful emotions which the new and very distinguished proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens evinced in my re-election to this high trust , has excited in my bosom . " The irony of Monroe 's gratitude is that he won re-election in a period when there was only one party in American politics . In this " Era of Good Feelings , " the vote in the electoral college was 231 for Monroe , 1 vote for John Quincy Adams , and 3 who did not vote . // The closest historical comparison for the audience would be the last president before Lincoln to be re-elected . Andrew Jackson used the first paragraph of his Second Inaugural to thank the American people " for their approbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been without its difficulties . " He went on to add , " I am at a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my gratitude . " Obviously , Jackson 's literary humility can just as easily be seen as a way of magnifying himself and his own accomplishments. // Franklin D. Roosevelt is judged by many to be the greatest president to follow Lincoln . Roosevelt 's presidency became known first for doing battle with the greatest economic depression in the nation 's history . He began his Second Inaugural in 1937 by offering a recapitulation of the problem and a progress report on the pathway to victory . // When four years ago we met to inaugurate a President , the Republic , single-minded in anxiety , stood in spirit here . We dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision  --  to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness . We of the Republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despair of that day . We did those things first . // Although the language is an inclusive " we , " Roosevelt steeps his words in a strong sense of personal triumph . // Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , Jackson , and Roosevelt insert themselves immediately into the structure of their second inaugural addresses . There is a marked contrast between the use of the personal pronoun by these five presidents and Lincoln . Jefferson works with the motif of the confidence of the people , but he is plainly saying that his leadership has justified their confidence . In the second sentence of their second inaugurals , Madison and Jackson emphasized that the electorate had lauded their efforts . Roosevelt , the commander-in-chief in a great domestic battle , assumed to himself a spirit of victory and vindication . // Jefferson , Madison , Jackson , and Roosevelt began their second inaugurals in personal and forceful prose that was clearly intended to raise expectations . Lincoln chose to be silent about thanking the voters for returning him to office . The " difficulties " that Jackson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's four years of travail. // * * * // " At this second appearing , " we pause to ask , how did Lincoln actually appear ? // Recent debates over how to portray Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the monument to him in Washington , D.C. , reveal how his paralysis was shielded from public view for the more than twelve years of his presidency . Many Americans did not know that the man who exuded such strength and energy struggled every day of his presidency merely to stand up . // Lincoln was impossible to shield . Six feet four inches tall , he stood out above any crowd . From the beginning of his political career , Lincoln 's appearance was a topic of conversation among both friends and enemies . His political handlers sought to make much of his appearance in his run for the presidency . His opponents used his appearance to deride him . George B. McClellan , Union general and Lincoln 's opponent in the 1864 presidential election , called Lincoln " the Gorilla . " Lincoln had been called worse . // Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln to more than twenty million television viewers . In the first war to be photographed , the photographs and images of Lincoln , although often in the background , were nonetheless pivotal among the countless images of soldiers and death . // Throughout Lincoln 's life , one reason for the public 's initial low expectations of him was its first glance at his form and features . More than a century later , when our image of Lincoln is through photographers who formalized him , we do n't forget the remarkable appearance of the sixteenth president of the United States . Hailed after his death as the American everyman , he was the object of frequent ridicule during his political life . // Lincoln 's public persona elicited comment even across the Atlantic . An English magazine reported in 1862 : " To say he is ugly is nothing ; to add that his figure is grotesque is to convey no adequate impression . Fancy a man almost six feet high , and thin in proportion , with long bony arms and legs which somehow always seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Lincoln 's head and face . " Add to this figure a head , cocanut sic shaped , and somewhat too small for such a stature , covered with rough , uncombed hair , that stands out in every direction at once ; a face , furrowed , wrinkled , and indented as though it had been scarred by vitriol . " // * * * // Lincoln 's law partner , Billy Herndon , made it his mission in life to tell the story of the real Lincoln . Herndon , aghast at biographers who painted an idealized portrait of a Lincoln he never knew , wanted to set the record straight . Part of the real Lincoln for Herndon was his physical appearance . Herndon went into grand detail in describing him . " He was thin , wiry , sinewy , raw-boned ; standing , he leaned forward  --  was what may be called stoop-shouldered , inclining to the consumptive by build . " Herndon described Lincoln 's face from the long association of viewing his associate in their law offices in Springfield . " His head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a low angle . His hair was dark , almost black , and lay floating where his fingers or the winds left it , piled up and random . " And again , " His ears were large , and ran out almost at right angles from his head , caused partly by heavy hats and partly by nature . " // Herndon 's earthy language went beyond physical description . " His structure was loose and leathery ; his body was shrunk and shriveled ; he had dark skin , dark hair , and looked woe-struck . " For Herndon the physical was linked to the mental . What better way to grasp Lincoln 's deliberate nature than to hear Herndon say : " The whole man , body and mind , worked slowly , as if it needed oiling " ? What did all of this add up to for Herndon ? " He was not a pretty man by any means , nor was he an ugly one ; he was a homely man , careless of his looks , plain-looking and plain-acting . " Herndon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * * * // Walt Whitman approached Lincoln from a different angle of vision . Whitman , who was just becoming known in the 1850s for the first editions of Leaves of Grass , branded the three presidents before Lincoln  --  Fillmore , Pierce , and Buchanan  --  " our topmost warning and shame . " In 1856 , Whitman wrote a tract entitled " The Eighteenth Presidency " that railed against the powers in political office . Read today , the language appears emotional and violent . Early on , Whitman asks where these politicians come from . He answers in epithets . " From the President 's house , the jail , the venereal hospital ... from the tumors and abscesses of the land ; from the skeletons and skulls in the vaults of federal almshouses , from the running sores of the great cities . " Whitman completed the pamphlet , set it in type , and offered proof sheets to editors and " rich persons " for publication . He had no takers . For more than seventy years , the yellowing proof sheets remained unpublished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance rays of hope residing in the people . The eighteenth president would be a man of the people . He would right the moral and political wrongs of the nation . Whitman dared to hope for some " healthy-bodied , middle-aged , beard-faced American blacksmith or boatman " who would " come down from the West across the Alleghenies , and walk into the Presidency . " // Whitman experienced an epiphany on first seeing Lincoln in February 1861 . The president-elect was on a circuitous twelve-day itinerary to Washington , D.C. , for his inauguration . Threats were present everywhere along the route . He arrived on February 18 in New York City , a city where less than 35 percent had voted for him . Whitman was certain that , in the crowd of thirty thousand , " many an assassin 's knife and pistol lurk 'd in hip or breast-pocket there , ready , as soon as break and riot came . " Lincoln arrived by hack at the Astor House Hotel . From the top of a stalled omnibus , Whitman marveled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and a stovepipe hat . " I had , I say , a capital view of it all ... his look and gait  --  his perfect composure and coolness  --  his unusual and uncouth height . " // After Whitman moved to Washington , D.C. , in 1863 , he observed Lincoln many times . He wrote in his notebook on August 12 , 1863 , " I see the President almost every day . " Although Whitman never met Lincoln , " we have got so that we exchange bows , and very cordial ones . " From these close encounters Whitman began to study Lincoln with great care and appreciation . // * * * // Photography and Lincoln were made for each other . The face of Lincoln , photographed by Mathew Brady and his pupil Alexander Gardner , brought the American public closer to their president than ever before . We know Washington and Jefferson only through stylized art based on European forms . The pre-presidential photography of Lincoln reveals the more homespun Western man whose clothes never quite seemed to fit . // Modern exhibits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and features . Especially poignant is the striking way Lincoln 's face changes through the Civil War years . He came to describe himself as an old man by the time he left Springfield for Washington on the day before his fifty-second birthday . Photography allows us to see this remarkable aging process in Lincoln . // From Whitman 's repeated sightings of Lincoln , he concluded that , in this new age of photography , " none of the artists or pictures has caught the deep though subtle and indirect expression of this man 's face . " Yes , Brady and Gardner were the best of their trade , but even their photographs of Lincoln did not fully capture the deep interior soul of his being . Whitman , after his initial enthusiasm with photography , quickly realized that this new visual art did not equal reality either . Whitman recognized that Lincoln , the Western man , was not like other politicians . Unfortunately , in the hands of photographers Brady and Gardner , Lincoln was dressed and posed like any other politician . // In a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen president . " I see very plainly ABRAHAM LINCOLN 'S dark brown face , with deep-cut lines , the eyes , always to me with a deep latent sadness in their expression . " On another occasion , after viewing Lincoln , Whitman wrote of Lincoln 's face , " Of technical beauty it had nothing  --  but to the eye of a great artist it furnished a rare study , a feast , and fascination . " // Whitman 's eye was becoming more practiced as he worked as a nurse in the hospitals of Washington . He struggled to find a comparison to Lincoln 's face . So filled with care and sorrow , Lincoln 's face was a paradox . At last , Whitman wrote , " He has a face like a hoosier Michel Angelo , so awful ugly it becomes beautiful . " // * * * // In the first paragraph of his Second Inaugural Address , Lincoln mentioned everything he would not say . This approach must have been preparing us for something that was not yet obvious . Lincoln was opening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was usual on such occasions . // Lincoln 's apparently flat recital of chronology was actually preparing the ground for a profound conversation about historical causation . He had been carrying on this conversation in private musings , in interviews at the White House , and in letters , but never before in any extended way in a public address . Beginning with a recital of temporal signposts , as he had earlier at Cooper Union and at Gettysburg , Lincoln would ask his audience to think with him about the cause and meaning of the war . //
