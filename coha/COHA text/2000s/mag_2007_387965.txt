. A fresh season awaits , and along with it yet another opportunity for you to become the ball striker you 've always wanted to be . This year , however , you 're going to do something about it by recasting your swing using these modern fundamentals . Maybe 2006 was the year for you  --  the one when rounds came together and the ball flew from the clubface exactly as planned . If it was , congratulations ! And do n't change a thing . But if you 're like the rest of us , it was an inconsistent year at best . A good shot or a great round here , a lost opportunity or a wicked slice there . If 2007 is going to be the year for you , compensations and luck wo n't get the job done . You need a swing you can replicate every time you take your stance over the ball . But where do you start ? The answer lies on the following pages , where we break down every segment of the swing you want and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our guide is simple because even adding just a few new wrinkles will pay huge dividends . And since perfecting one segment of your swing makes the ones that follow automatic , lasting improvement will come more quickly than you expect . BACKSWINGForm an " L " with your left arm and shaft , then move it to the top for maximum width and powerPage 118 DOWNSWINGKeep your elbows level to stay on plane-the key to consistencyPage 122 IMPACTHow the back of your left hand can help you make Tour-quality contact Page124 PRE-SWING A three-point stance builds the foundation for success The majority of your swing errors  --  and the need to make compensations  --  are the result of mistakes in your setup . Copy the positions below to put your backswing on autopilot and set the stage for all the other components of your swing to fall into place . DO N'T BEND YOUR BACKKeep your spine straight  --  a line should connect the back of your shoulders and the back of your head . KEY CHECKPOINT THREE-POINT STANCEThe correct blend of knee bend and hip tilt will align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees and your shoulders . HANG OUTAllow your arms to dangle freely from your shoulders ( right arm hides the left ) . UNLOCK YOUR KNEESBend them slightly and tilt more from your hips ( keeping a straight back ) to sole the club . BUCKLE UPThe shaft points at your belt buckle when the club is soled properly on the ground . WHAT YOU SHOULD SEEYour right shoulder lower than your left , and your hands even with the ball ( zero forward-press ) . MAKE IT SEMI-WIDETake a balanced , shoulder-width stance using your heels  --  not your toes  --  as a guide . CLIMB A LADDERWith good posture , your knees , hips and shoulders are spaced equally apart , like a ladder . TAKEAWAY Move your shoulders  --  and nothing else  --  to start the club back Your takeaway exists for milliseconds and consists of just a few inches , but what a critical few inches ! If your takeaway is solid , you 'll easily generate two key features of a repeating swing : a wide swing arc and an on-line path . BE A TEAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands and arms , not vice versa . CONTROL DISTANCEKeep your right arm at the same distance from your torso as you take away the club . BUCKLE UP  --  AGAINYou 've done it right if the shaft still points at your belt buckle ( no inside or outside move ) . MAINTAIN STANCEStrive for " quiet legs " with your weight secured to the insides of both feet . ADD WIDTHKeep your left arm soft but fully extended , just like it was in the address position . WHAT YOU SHOULD SEERelaxed arms that keep the club in front of your body . STAY ON PLANEYour shoulders should move your arms and club straight back , just slightly inside your target line . KEY CHECKPOINTThroughout your takeaway , your club , shaft and hands are in line with your belt buckle . * Your takeaway is a shoulder-dominated move  --  rock them back like you 're trying to hit a 100-foot putt . Overusing your hands increases the likelihood that you 'll whip the club too far inside . Notice the absence of wrist hinge until the club is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " L " then move it up to achieve maximum width and power It 's not important how far back the club is at the top  --  it 's how you get there . The key is to maintain the width and plane you established in the takeaway and ratchet up your power . WHAT YOU SHOULD SEEYour left wrist should be flat and your right wrist bent  --  the perfect anti-slice position . KEY CHECKPOINT LOOK FOR THE LAt the end of your takeaway , rotate your forearms and hinge your wrists to create an L. Move the L to the top by turning your shoulders to create maximum width and power . HOW TO DO IT 1 ) Set the club parallel to the ground and your target line by rotating your forearms and hinging your wrists . 2 ) Keep turning your shoulders and make sure the back of your left hand matches the angle of the clubface . KEY MOVE 3 ) Lift your arms as you continue to turn  --  this is what maintains the L. 4 ) You 've done it right if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've created separation between your right side and your right elbow . TRANSITION Move from backswing to downswing without moving your head The top of your swing is the moment when you need to seamlessly transition from backward movement to forward motion . The key is to let gravity do its thing . Before you start down , make sure your head and shoulders are behind the ball  --  this gives you the best chance to stay on plane . The transition happens in a flash : your hips " bump " to the left and your arms drop , but your head and shoulders stay back . KEY MOVEAs you make the first move down , keep your head and shoulders up ( no dropping , bobbing or tilting ) . If you 've kept your hands away from your body going back , you 'll have all the power you need without swinging hard . * If you 're on plane at the top , your chances of success skyrocket . A quick check is that your elbows are level to each other . If your right elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your right elbow is below your left , you 're too flat . SET THE LEVELLevel elbows are a good guarantee that you 're on plane at the top position . KEY CHECKPOINTIf you drop your arms correctly without moving your shoulders , you should still see level elbows . GO , GRAVITY , GO ! Your first move down is to drop your arms  --  make sure you keep your right shoulder and your head up . DOWNSWING Keep your right shoulder back for increased arm speed You made your takeaway and backswing using mostly your shoulders . Now it 's time for your arms to power the club into the back of the ball . At this point , excess body and shoulder action is typically the cause of your swing moving off plane . BACKSWING LThe L formed by your left arm and shaft that appears in your downswing ... DOWNSWING L ... should reappear in your downswing at the same position . Re-forming the L means you saved maximum energy for impact . HOW TO DO IT 1 At the top : Level elbows , shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your body . 2 With very little leg movement , the arms drop straight down ( elbows are still level ) . 3 Envision crushing a plastic soda bottle under your right armpit ; check that the shaft sits between both elbows . KEY CHECKPOINTIf you make your downswing with mostly arms , you 'll easily keep the club on plane . 4 Maintain posture and re-create the L formed between your left arm and clubshaft. 5 Keep your head , body and shoulders up  --  this allows your arms to continue to drop and rotate into the ball . 6 You 've done it right if , once again , the club , shaft and your hands are in line with your belt buckle . * Few players understand how power is created in the downswing . Most of us confuse power with force , which is why we try to force the club into the back of the ball by using our bodies while our arms simply go along for the ride . Downswing power is the result of speed , and the faster your arms fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . WHAT YOU SHOULD SEEWhen your hands reach your right thigh , the club should be parallel to the ground and your target line . MATCH IT UPThe back of the left hand and face of the club match up just like the takeaway . HOLD IT BACKDo n't let your right shoulder dominate your downswing  --  hold it back and your swing will fall into place . BE A POWER SAVERAs your arms fall , your wrists should remain hinged , saving the energy within for impact . MOVE IT OR LOSE ITAs you drop your arms , isolate your weight to the inside of the balls of both feet . IMPACT Rotate the club through impact with your arms , not your hands If you 've followed the plan to this point , quality impact will happen by itself , but knowing where you should be when you strike the ball is an important step in improving the other elements of your swing . * Your impact position should be a mirror of your address position . You 'll always make solid contact if your spine and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at address , and if the shaft angle at impact is the same as it was at setup . STAY IN-LINEThe butt of the club points at your belt buckle . If it points behind , you released too early . RE-CREATE ADDRESSCopy your setup posture  --  imagine someone holding your head up ( but not still ) before impact . WHAT YOU SHOULD SEEIt 's important to rotate your arms as fast as possible through the hitting zone . Think " fast arms , slow body . " KEY CHECKPOINTThe clubface should point in the same direction as the back of your left hand  --  at the target . GET SHIFTYShift your weight from the inside of your left foot to the outside and keep your right foot stable . BALANCEKeep your knees unlocked and stay balanced over the balls of both feet despite shifting your weight from your right side to your left . * Do n't attempt to square the clubface with your body . Instead , turn the back of your left hand toward the ground . At the same time , try to rotate your right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE DOOR 1 Retain the hinge in your wrists deep into the downswing. 2 Continue to move your hands while your right shoulder stays back . 3 Rotate the back of your left hand as if you 're turning a doorknob. 4 Open the door so that the back of your left hand faces the target . 5 Keep your arms extended through impact ( do n't chicken wing ) . 6 Maintain the triangle formed by your arms , hands and shaft . RELEASE Release your arms past your body to improve your impact Your release is an extension of your downswing and impact positions . But do n't take it for granted  --  keep on rotating the club all the way to the top . RULE OF ARMSYour arms swing the body , not vice versa , even in the follow- through . STAY PASSIVEKeep your right leg passive  --  this will allow you to rotate the club past your body . POST UPYour left leg should form a post . Your arms should swing past it and sling the club through the ball and up to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a full extension of your hands and arms . KEY CHECKPOINT Whip your arms away from your body as if you 're swinging to right field on a baseball diamond . You 're in the batter 's box  --  release the clubhead toward right field . Maintain your spine angle through impact to ensure a fast release  --  and more clubhead speed  --  with your arms . THE FULL SWING Focus on parallel and perpendicular The final step is to put this sequence of positions into motion . The unifying move is creating the " L " and maintaining swing width . If you do that , your swing breaks into a series of alternating vertical and horizontal shaft positions that you can consistently repeat .
