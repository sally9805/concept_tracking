Morning throttles up early in the capital of Sledhead Nation . It 's eight o'clock on a Friday in late March , and pickups dragging trailers of piggybacked snowmobiles are rumbling up Rutherford Creek , an hour 's drive from the slopes of Whistler . The Coast Range 's usual gym sock-gray skies are a Windex blue that residents see about four days each winter . It 's too good to miss , so nobody does . By nine o'clock , 15 trucks clog the trailhead . Guys unload snowmobiles , yank starter cords . The sleds make a peeved sound . It 's such a classic snowmobile scene that my eyes take a few minutes to adjust and notice what 's missing : There 's not a single specimen of the stereotypical Sledneckis americanus , the ham-faced , beaconless rube stuffed into a visored helmet , keg belly testing the seams of an oil-stained snowmobile suit . Instead , dudes spill out of cabs , trailing rap music , their wool hats so low they look like Dumb Donald from Fat Albert . They strap snowboards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridges that jut from the Pemberton Ice Cap , 10 miles to the north . The grumbling of that first snowmobile is joined by another , then another . The forest is now a hive of noise . The only cloud in the sky is a cumulus of two-stroke oil that hovers over the parking lot . Then the hive is moving , and we are moving with it , gunning into the future of Canadian backcountry skiinga world of remote couloirs , unpoached powder , big lines , high decibels , sneaking peril , and earnest hand-wringing . Behind us , the nimbus over the trailhead looks like a squall brewing . And still , the pickups keep arriving . Seth Morrison has one . Ditto for J.T. Holmes , filmmaker Steve Winter , and Mike Douglas , the headmaster of skiing 's New School . That jibber with the Hollywood smile gassing up his sled at the Husky filling station in Whistler this morning ? That was snowboard star J.P . Walker . " I ca n't believe it took me this long to get on the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whining two-banger . " I 'll have one for the rest of my life . " Some call it sled-skiing ; others , hybrid skiing . Whatever the label , using snowmobiles to access powder is going off . To have a Yamaha , Arctic Cat , or Polaris dangling from your trailer hitch in Canada today is to be in possession of the ski accessory of the moment . The movement , however , is decidedly proletarian : North of Whistlerso off-the-map it 's easier accessed in winter via a 35-mile snowmobile route than by asphaltski bums are buying ramshackle Victorians in the for-gotten mining town of Bralorne , cruising down the snowy main drag each morning , and heading into the bush to score untapped lines on lonesome peaks . In the yawning ranges of central British Columbia , where the mountains are scribbled with logging roads , roughneck Revelstoke has a strong core of sled-skiers . And for $200 , a commercial sled-ski outfit in Valemount will haul you up to fresh tracks all day in the same mountain ranges where heli-ski outfits charge $800 . British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing . Long before Detroit started driving Explorers through snowbanks in American TV ads , sleds were the original winter SUV in the Canadian province 's remote communities . And there 's a lot of ground to cover . B.C. is 35 percent larger than California and Nevada combinedyet , unlike the U.S. , Canada never chopped itself up : A whopping 92 percent of the territory is still public land . Snowmobilers can ride on much of itand they do , thanks to untold miles of mountain roads that are a legacy of B.C. 's robust ( or rapacious , depending on your bent ) logging and mining past . The province is still unpopulated enough that conflicts among users have not been , in general , so acute as in the States . South of the border , cultural differences and environmental concerns have kept sled-skiing numbers modest , but it 's still revving up noticeably : Near Mammoth Lakes , California , skiers and snowboarders are blasting up San Joaquin Ridge and Bloody Mountain for quick powder fixes . On deep days in Steamboat , Colorado , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickups to Buffalo Pass , unloading snowmobiles , and skiing freshies long after the resort is played out . Vail Pass , Colorado , has become the epicenter of U.S. hybrid skiing . According to a survey a few years ago , more than 12 percent of the pass 's 22,000 user-days were logged by sled-skiers on the hunt for fresh tracks . Says Don Dressler , lead backcountry ranger for the Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area , " there has been a noticeable increase " in the last two years . In Canada and beyond , technology has been the most potent fuel for the upturn . Snowmobiles now sport engines with more horsepower than small cars . Bigger skis and longer tracks help them float in deep powder . Higher handlebars mean you can steer them more like a mountain bike . All of which makes it faster and easier than ever to access the backcountry . It did n't take long for a hypercaffeinated generation to discover the new rides . Now , in addition to the latest TGR or Matchstick flicks , younger skiers have been increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold Smoke series and The Roops of Hazard . ( Roopin ' is " biler slang for blasting up steep slopes , spinning donuts , and general mayhem . ) They 're bringing a go-big , frontcountry attitude to the backcountrythis time , with snowmobiles . Open any mountain-town newspaper to the classifieds and you can find a sled selling for as little as $1,500 , which is not so much more , really , than a new ski-touring setup and a pair of climbing skins . But in this age where impatience is a virtue , a sled comes with something skiers are powerless to resist : the promise of a lot more powder , for a lot less effort . In NASCAR country it 's known as " meeting Jesus on the wall " that inauspicious moment when speed , circumstance , and luck conspire to deliver a race driver to his maker . This phrase comes to mind as I watch Joe Lammers drop into his first run of the day on the Pemberton Ice Cap . Photographer Fred Foto and I arrived here with Lammers and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an hour 's snowmobile ride up Rutherford Creek . The curtain of forest parts to reveal a sprawling neversummerland of Antarctic-style ice sheets . Seracs ripple against stubborn ridges , and thumbs of rock jab 1,500 feet through the ice cap . It 's the kind of place you 'd never see in winter without a whole lot of time and leg strength , a big wallet for heli time ... or a snowmobile . " Let 's give " er , " says Lammers , eyeing the 50-plus-degree face above us . Lammers , 34 , is red-haired , freckled , joking ; he occasionally skis in movies , and he keeps a Polaris RMK 700 in his truck bed . He , Macdougall , and Eby ride sleds to the shoulder of the peak , then boot-pack to the summit . Macdougall and Eby carve the face cleanly , down powder that still lingers a week after the last snowfall . Lammers takes the most exposed line of all , down a fluted face that 's interrupted by cheese-grater rock bands . Falling will deliver nasty consequences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the falls . He hunkers down . Snow pours over him , pulling at his skis and his equilibrium . Then , the danger is past . Free of the crux , Lammers rips the rest of the line , fast and smooth . At the bottom , Macdougall has unhinged the cowling of his Skidoo and opened a package of chicken sausages , which he 's barbecuing on his muffler . " Beaks and assholes , probably , " he says , handing them out . " You 've eaten worse , eh , Joe ? " " Ca n't say I 've eaten better . " The near-catastrophic moment is apparently already forgotten . It 's just another perfect , perilous day in paradise . We recline on sleds in the warm , end-of-winter sunshine . " What gets us out here is it 's so crowded on the hill , " says Eby , himself a ski-movie regular and , like Lammers , a freeskiing instructor at Whistler 's Extremely Canadian . He pulls out a pouch of tobacco , rolls a cigarette . " You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fresh anymore . Here , " he says , " we 're not really pressed for space . " The only thing crowding us are several red jerry cansour gasoline cache . Macdougall , 30 , who manages to sled- or lift-ski 60 days a winter while also running a carpentry business , leans against his black SkiDoo Summit 700 and tells me about the new house he 's about to build for himself . " You can sled right out the front door , " he says , smiling . The snowboarders from the parking lot have long ago disappeared on the vastness of the ice cap , building a huge kicker somewhere . All I see are the ski tracks the boys laid down yesterdayand the unlimited worry-your-mother chutes that have n't even been touched . Later , somebody points out the slopes of Whistler in the distance . From the ice cap , North America 's largest resort looks bite-size , almost quaint , like something seen from an airplane . It 's time to scope another line , and we collect our cache , strap down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The morning 's chainsawed quiet falls in shards . The sun is warming everything fast , so we race around the ice cap , looking for remaining icebox pow that 's tucked into the shadows . Each time we cut the engines the silence reassembles itself . Then the buzzing starts . The noise seems to hatch at first from that ringing in the ears that is noiselessness . It 's mosquito-like , and growing louder . Perhaps two miles away , two dots crest a rise . Other snowmobiles . I 'm a little deflated . I wish , hypocritically , that they were n't here . " Do the sleds ever bother you ? " I ask Macdougall . " They only bother you when you ca n't afford one yourself , " he replies . There are , however , plenty of people worried by snowmobiles , and for reasons beyond just their 80-decibel flatulence . They 're worse polluters than cars . They stress wildlife . Their compacted trails may give predators an advantage over prey . For these reasons , Paul Morrison , the award-winning Whistler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo n't touch a snowmobileunless there 's no other option , like in a rescuethough they have become a tool of the trade for ski photographers desperate to shoot untouched lines . " As a photographer , there has been great pressure to join my friends as they go out for shooting opportunities , " Morrison says . " My argument against sleds is simple : They are among the most air-polluting machines an individual can own . " For the recreation community , the rise of sled-skiing has added a wrinkle to the tired **29;2721;TOOLONG debate . Hybrid skiing " seems to be actually the biggest thorn in our side , " says Kim Hedberg , director of the Colorado-based Backcountry Snowsports Alliance , which protects the interests of the human-powered . " Because the hybrids do n't consider themselves snowmobilers , " Hedberg says , " a lot of them think that they should go wherever they want . " Officials and activists both predict that the backcountry could soon be carved up for separate useson both sides of the border . At Buffalo and Rabbit Ears passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start segregating muscle-powered skiers from mechanized users and posting enforcement officers to keep the peace . In B.C. , a winter-recreation task force has proposed dividing the 2.7-million-acre Squamish Forest District surrounding Whistler into some 25 different use areas . " It 's part of the evolution , " Rob McCurdy , director of the Whistler Alpine Guides Bureau , which takes visitors backcountry skiing , told me later with a shrug in his voice . " There needs to be a balance . Everybody ca n't go everywhere . " For now , thoughat least in Canadaeveryone still can . On our perfect day , with the snow stable and the sun glowing , bad experiences seem as remote as the clouds tucked beyond the horizon . The Coast Range , however , is quick to rise up and slap you . " A buddy of mine broke his femur out here last week , on Rainbow Mountain , " says Lammers , casually recalling a sled-skiing slide . " In the last four years , I 've seen two other avalanche incidents up heresomeone who actually was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds . All were using sleds to ski or board . ( The Whistler locals I 'm with are all seasoned backcountry travelers , and Lammers teaches snow-safety classes . ) Then there 's the sledding itself , which has its own learning curveand its own dangers . The boys by now are old hands . When Lammers and Utah skier Gordy Peifer head up for another run , they do n't even bother to tow each other . Each stands on one running board , grips a handlebar , and leans out like a trolley-man , counterbalancing and steering in unison . " It takes about a year of sucking before you actually become proficient , " Lammers tells me , after watching me pussyfoot my way down a hill , worrying my sled 's brakes the entire time . " It takes a while to know how to ride in deep snow . And that 's assuming you 're already a good-enough skier and have the amount of awareness to be out there in the first place . " Another day on the ice cap , the hazards become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700cc SX Viper Deep Powder Special , whose swept-back cowling and angular headlamp impart it with a wicked grin . As I cruise up a steep hill toward our next destination , the sled begins to drift left . I try to correct the drift , but my reactions are clumsy and slow . The Yamaha lists further . One front ski leaves the ground . I jump off . This is not wise . Now the sled is above me on the steep hill , on its side . There , my snowmobile hesitates , as if trying to decide whether it has found its angle of repose . It has not . The sled begins to roll . I try to leap out of the way , but the snow is n't firm and I ca n't scuttle from its path . The Viper is picking up speed . Some acrobatic instinct takes over , and I begin to tumble , too , flinging myself in great loops down the hill , trying to stay ahead of a 500-pound rolling pin . After six or seven somersaults , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights itself , and zooms down the hill alonea " ghost rider , " as " bilers call it . Fred Foto , a veteran sled-skier , zooms up to check on me . I think I 've given myself a minor concussion . " You got off easy , " he tells me . At the Squamish repair shop , my snafu will cost me $500 . But later , back on the ice cap , the immediate physical cautions and the larger social concerns about divvying up the backcountry both seem distant . Here , there 's nowhere we ca n't seem to go . Lammers and Eby zoom to a ridgecrest , jump from their sleds , click into their skis , and catch air off a spine that 's too sketchy-steep for mere mortals . I sit and watch . Then they strap skis to sleds , and we light out again . Across the valley , a sledneck high-marks up a steep slope and upends . His snowmobile rolls down the mountain , shedding parts . We watch until he shows signs of life . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 60 , 70 , 90 miles an hour , catching stellar dendrites in the teeth like a motorcyclist catches bugs .
