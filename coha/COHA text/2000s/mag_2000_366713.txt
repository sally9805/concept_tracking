AL GORE 's challenge to GEORGE W. BUSH in the wake of the Super Tuesday primaries  --  twice-a-week debates , joint town meetings , forswearing party soft money  --  sounded high-minded , but it was really wishful thinking . Without some sort of seismic shift in the ground rules , Gore faces a daunting task : keeping the Democratic National Committee flush enough to compete with the expected barrage of G.O.P. TV ads all spring and summer . <P> The night Gore swept to victory , party chairman ED RENDELL was at the New Jersey home of state senator Ray Lesniak , telling him and other top Gore fund raisers that he wants to bring in $45 million to run ads in 10 to 15 battleground states from April until the August Democratic Convention . He told the group he expects Bush and the R.N.C . to raise twice that much . <P> Insiders grouse that Rendell has failed to net big dollars , but the former mayor of Philadelphia , who plans to run for Governor in 2002 , is considered too important to sweep aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to leave ? " the self-assured chairman said to TIME . He boasts $10 million in February receipts , most of it from events headlined by the President . <P> Bill Clinton remains the party 's best draw ; he could tally as much as $25 million before the convention , a Democratic insider estimates . A gala tribute to Clinton in May , staged by money magician Terry McAuliffe , is expected to raise at least $5 million . Gore will begin pitching in later this month . On March 30 , with two Gore dinners in Washington and three Clinton events in New York City , the D.N.C. hopes to ring in close to $3 million . <P> Last week Rendell sent pleas to the D.N.C. 's biggest hitters to contribute sooner rather than later for the planned air offensive this spring , but he has competition . The Gore campaign has n't finished raising the roughly $44 million it 's allowed to spend before the convention under federal matching-fund rules ( by which Bush is n't bound ) . Gore remains about $3 million shy of finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be done last fall . <P> Meanwhile , Gore is moving faster than past presumptive nominees to take over his party 's apparatus . Campaign officials Donna Brazile and Michael Whouley are being pressured to move from Gore headquarters in Nashville to the D.N.C. , and national finance chairman Johnny Hayes may soon follow . <P>  --  By Viveca Novak and Michael Weisskopf/Washington
