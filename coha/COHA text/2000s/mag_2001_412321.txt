Section : Outlook 2002 ; Cover Package ; Special Report ; New World Order It 's endgame time in Afghanistan , but the war against terror is far from over <p> As his Air Force 757 jetliner roared back to Washington on September 11 , Colin Powell called aides into his cabin . He had just cut short a visit to Lima , Peru , to promote democracy in Latin America . But as Powell settled into his captain 's chair to ponder the new age of terror , the Lima meetings already seemed part of a quieter era . " This changes everything , " the secretary of state declared . <p> Rarely have the fundamentals of American foreign policy shifted in a single day , but that is what happened on September 11 . The attacks in New York and Washington brought down the curtain on the interregnum known as " the post-Cold War era . " Now there is an urgent , clarifying mission : Fight terrorism with a global coalition . " Either you are with us , " declared President Bush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administration whose initial , go-it-alone instincts offended even close friends , preserving a global coalition wo n't necessarily be easy . The foreign-policy rookie in the White House prided himself on being " straightforward . " But it was much more than Bush 's bluntness that put off friends in Europe and Asia . The administration had championed a treaty-busting missile shield , taken a hard line on China , and rejected pacts to ban nuclear tests , establish a war crimes court , and curb global warming . From abroad , Bush seemed to define U.S. interests narrowly and to act unilaterally . Newspapers caricatured him as a lone cowboy . <p> Then came 9/11 . Worldwide revulsion and the shared sense of threat handed Washington a once-in-a-generation chance to shake up international politics . Ten days after the attacks , State Department experts cataloged for Powell a dozen " silver linings . " <p> " We are going to try to make the best of those opportunities , " Powell vowed later . " Nobody 's calling us unilateral anymore . We 're so multilateral it keeps me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The need to hit up old friends and make new ones , says a senior administration official , " reminded us we are n't an island . " And yet , apart from counterterrorism , Bush 's new activism is still in keeping with an unsentimental realpolitik . Rejected treaties wo n't be reconsidered . Just weeks ago , Bush announced he would stick with his decision to abandon the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty . The State Department , meanwhile , has adopted the motto " hardheaded multilateralism . " <p> New chemistry . A flexible wartime foreign policy means the United Nations is back in good graces : The administration is even counting on the oft-maligned international body to lead " nation building " efforts in postwar Afghanistan . Elsewhere , the new chemistry in foreign affairs continues to transform relationships . Four months ago , U.S.-Russian relations were chilly . But President Vladimir Putin is gambling the counterterrorism campaign will reconnect Russia with the West , bringing economic and diplomatic benefits . Snubbing his military chiefs , Putin accepted a U.S. military presence in Central Asia . That allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finesse their dispute over missile defense , Putin and Bush are planning deep cuts in nuclear arms . <p> Almost as unprecedented is Pakistan 's shotgun wedding with the United States . Once a Cold War ally , Pakistan was devolving into a consistent source of trouble  --  nuclear weapons tests , the military overthrow of an elected government , and support for Islamic militants fighting India . Pakistan , of course , propped up the Taliban . But confronted with U.S. demands , Pakistan reinvented itself , at least for now , as an ally . <p> Even China is acquiescing in the U.S.-led war . Not long ago , Bush called it a " strategic competitor , " and the two sides were arguing over Taiwan and spy planes . Fearful of being left out of a burgeoning U.S.-Russia friendship , China is now eager to talk . <p> Finally , old-line allies are again ascendant going into 2002 . British Prime Minister Tony Blair , a Laborite ideologically more in sync with U.S. Democrats than with Bush , stepped into a traditional role : the indispensable ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where pacifism still runs strong , each dispatched military units . <p> In the coming year , counterterrorism will continue to trump other priorities . As a result , some regions of the world , like Africa and Latin America , may take second billing . Before September 11 , Mexican President Vicente Fox stood in as Bush 's main amigo abroad ; immigration and border controls were to be eased . But the sudden preoccupation with security may thwart the lofty vision of an open Southern border . Instead , Washington is likely to emphasize cooperation with nations and regions that have been victimized by Islamic extremism : Russia , China , India , and Western Europe . <p> The biggest question for 2002 : How far beyond Afghanistan will the United States and its allies carry the war against terrorism ? After September 11 , Powell and his team of diplomatic hand-holders found it relatively easy to muster a coalition against al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden . But as the war winds down , identifying the world 's villains  --  at least those deemed to have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riskiest proposition is Iraq , where a U.S. attack could inflame Arab opposition and worsen the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . The reality is that the counterterrorism campaign to come may well require more , not less , reaching out to " rogues "  --  states like Iran , Syria , Sudan , and Libya long branded as sponsors of terrorism . The goal is not only to isolate terrorists but to embolden moderates . For now , Sudan , Syria , and Libya are sharing intelligence , say U.S. officials , and Iran has agreed to rescue any wayward American fliers . " There 's a tremendous opportunity for the sinners to be redeemed and for the old battles to be put aside , " says a senior State Department aide . In war , pragmatism is usually the first victor . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : For the 2 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan , time to go home ? <p> By Thomas Omestad <p>
