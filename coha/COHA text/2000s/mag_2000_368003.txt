Common sense would dictate that the burgeoning high-tech industry of northern Virginia and southern Maryland should take the lead in lobbying the nation 's capital on behalf of technology interests . Not so . Executives who live just outside the Washington Beltway had to be dragged into the political fray by Charles Manatt , former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and now U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic . Manatt struggled for years to organize the executives but did n't get it done until a conference of business leaders from the Potomac River region last year led to a breakthrough . " It was a difficult sell , and it still is n't easy , " Manatt says . <P> Lobbying at the federal level is an acquired taste even for people in proximity to the capital . Like the rest of the tech community , Washington-area execs long kept politics and government at arm 's length , believing that all they needed to do was to make profits and create jobs and the lawmakers would leave them alone . But they have come to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's antitrust suit against Microsoft in 1998 scared all tech companies smart , and the firms closest to the seat of power are on their way to becoming the most active advocates of the new economy there . <P> Washington lobbying has changed as a result . Not long ago , lobbyists were a lot like their caricature  --  fat , cigar-smoking men who handed out envelopes stuffed with hundred-dollar bills to compliant lawmakers . Some people who fit that description ( except for the cash ) still exist , and they 're fun to have lunch with . But these days lobbyists are more likely to be advertising executives , public relations specialists , telemarketers , academics and , increasingly , real-life business executives . <P> Lawmakers love to hear directly from CEOs . The business leaders that lawmakers want to see most , though , are the up-and-comers who run fast-growing e-commerce companies . With their cachet and cash , tech executives are in high demand on Capitol Hill . Especially those who work and live a 30-minute drive away . Indeed , geography was the genesis of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the spring of 1999 , Mark Bisnow , an executive at Virginia 's MicroStrategy and a former Senate aide , rented a bus and took nine Democratic Senators on a tour of his own company , America Online and PSINet , among other locals . The legislators were surprised to see so much computer wizardry so close by . At the end of the tour , Senate minority leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said contentedly , " We 're starting to watch technology companies a little like we watch sports . "
