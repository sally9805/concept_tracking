<p> Joffrey Ballet of Chicago <p> Thursday through <p> March 26 <p> Auditorium Theatre , <p> 50 E. Congress <p> Tickets , $ 10-$ 50 <p> ( 312 ) 902-1500 <p> A giant plastic sheet balloons just below the ceiling of the main rehearsal studio of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago . No , it 's not the latest in avant-garde set design . It hangs there simply to catch the falling plaster and other debris that periodically rains on the dancers in their run-down home on North Wabash . <p> But what 's a little plaster dust and a precarious roof for that most stalwart of all dance companies ? This is the ensemble that , after five decades of illustrious history  --  and five years of residence in this city  --  has become one of Chicago 's most venerable cultural institutions . <p> The Joffrey may seem to thrive on adversity , but that should n't be mistaken for the necessary ingredient of its creative inspiration . All you have to do is sit down for a chat with Gerald Arpino , the company 's tireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or watch its two dozen dancers move from one choreographic masterpiece to another with chameleon-like ease  --  to know that the troupe is in a triumphant mode . Its future is becoming increasingly secure ( its $ 5.5 million budget for 1996 is now up to a meticulously meted out $ 9.25 million ) , and it is beginning to unearth the many dance treasures that were once in its repertoire , and whose costumes and sets are carefully packed away in a warehouse . <p> " I 've been holding back , " Arpino confessed . " The wheels in my mind are always turning . But I wanted to nurture the company , get a strong foothold in this city which has been so good to us , and take the conservative route to keep the company going . Sure , I want live music , I want more dancers , I want to do the full-length works  --  bring back ' Petrouchka ' and the other big pieces . But I 've had to go slow . And I still need a building for my artists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices is in the works in a joint deal with the city and Commonwealth Edison . A crack team of ballet masters ( the archivists and workhorses of the company who oversee rehearsals ) is in place . The company 's repertoire is expanding to include painstaking revivals of the ballets that made the Joffrey famous , as well as other works that will enrich its holdings . An international television project is being negotiated . And exciting new plans for next year 's seasons  --  which must remain under wraps for the moment  --  are close to becoming finalized . <p> Above all , anyone who saw the company in its fall season at the Auditorium Theatre will tell you about the buzz of astonishment and awe that filled the lobby at intermission  --  and turned into powerful word of mouth . The Joffrey had never danced with greater brilliance or panache . And after many years of silence , even the New York Times is taking note  --  coming to town to tell the story of the company that did what many thought impossible  --  fleeing hard times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now in its spring season , running Thursday through March 26 at the Auditorium , the Joffrey will present two programs that together demonstrate why it has long held a unique place in the dance pantheon of this country . <p> The first pays homage to Serge Diaghilev , the early 20th century impresario who founded and directed the Ballets Russes ( 1909-29 ) and commissioned very definition of " modern . " The lineup includes three works : " The Prodigal Son , " George Balanchine 's 1929 interpretation of the Bible story set to the music of Prokoviev , with sets and costumes by Georges Rouault ; " Afternoon of a Faun , " Vaslav Nijinsky 's groundbreaking 1912 work , set to the music of Claude Debussy , with scenery and costumes by Leon Bakst , and " Les Presages " ( " Omens " ) , Leonide Massine 's 1933 work to Tchaikovsky 's Fifth Symphony , with decor by Andre Masson . <p> The second program is an all-American bill that loosely traces the development of classical and modern dance styles through the work of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 1957 ) , the Russian emigre 's hybrid of the Old World and the new , set to the music of Corelli and Vivaldi and featuring a live caller ; Jose Limon 's " The Moor 's Pavane " ( 1949 ) , a distillation of Shakespeare 's " Othello , " set to the music of Henry Purcell ; Alwin Nikolais ' " Tensile Involvement " ( 1953 ) , an abstract , architectural work for masks , props , mobiles and nine dancers , and " Trinity " ( 1970 ) , Arpino 's ode to the youth culture of the late 1960s . <p> " The Joffrey Ballet always had its own special niche in the dance world , " said Richard Tanner , a ballet master with the New York City Ballet , who taught " The Prodigal Son " to the company and performed in the piece while Balanchine was still alive . <p> " When I was a young dancer in New York , the Joffrey was the company we all went to see . They did stuff that nobody else did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum . Now , coming here to work with the company , I was amazed to see how great they looked . And when I got back home , I was surprised by how many young dancers asked me about them ; they grew up knowing about the company , even if they 'd never seen it , and they loved the famous photographs of them . " <p> Ask Arpino to talk about the works he selected for the spring programs and he smiles broadly while launching into a history lesson . <p> " What you have to remember is that I am , first and foremost , a theater man , " he said . " My own pure dance works are a release , but it 's theater that pulls me  --  the ingenious combination of music and costuming and sets in connection with the choreography . Nowadays we think of lighting as the main design element , but that 's mostly a matter of economics . Diaghilev 's genius was the way he put all those people and art forms together . <p> " Look at ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of a young man who leaves his father 's home to go out into the world , which he finds is a pretty cruel place . I love the way Balanchine defined those characters . The Siren represents all temptations and seductions . Today she 'd probably be dancing in the nude , but here she is so powerful with that purple velvet cape and that aloof attitude . And then there are the goons with their debauchery and stupidity  --  the guys who steal the son 's innocence . This is a story for our society today  --  how we can be seduced by the wrong forces unless we are strong enough to return to our roots . " <p> Turning to " Afternoon of a Faun , " Arpino marvels at Nijinsky 's iconoclasm and the " total theater " of his work . <p> " He was the real avant-garde  --  the one who broke the ballet form before anyone else , the one who went against all the proprieties , who upset the accepted norms of ballet . He violated all the traditional ideas about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredible statement about the animal drive within man . It 's still a very shocking ballet , and again , it 's done without nudity . It 's about what is n't stated , although there is always a lot of debate about what is happening in its final seconds . " <p> Arpino also admires Massine 's large-scale work " Les Presages , " which paved the way for contemporary abstract ballets . " It has such an ingenious structure , " he said . " And I love the way it looks at the constant battle between good and evil . The critics initially objected to the use of an orchestral score for a ballet , but no one questions that now . " <p> While Arpino cherishes the great works of the early European modernists , he is , above all , an American boy , still dazzled by the way he and the late Robert Joffrey were able to create an internationally recognized dance company out of a small troupe that once traveled from gig to gig in a station wagon . If ever there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were it , and as Arpino notes , " it was n't easy . " <p> And so , he put together the American program . He chose to revive Balanchine 's " Square Dance , " a technically demanding work , for nostalgic reasons  --  because he 'd danced the lead in it . He loves " The Moor 's Pavane " for the way it captures an entire story with just four dancers and a handkerchief , and because he thinks " it will extend the range of the company to include the vocabulary of modern dance . " And he has mounted Nikolais ' rarely revived " Tensile Involvement "  --  a marvel of giant elastic cables and dancers  --  because he has " such deep respect for the innovators . " <p> About his own work , " Trinity , " created at a time when the Joffrey was the hottest company around , he says frankly , " It was my homage to the Woodstock generation . I remember looking out the windows of our studios in ( Greenwich ) Village in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles as they marched along Sixth Avenue . We performed ( the work ) for the first time during a residency in Berkeley , Calif. , while the nation 's campuses were in chaos and the ecology movement was just getting started . Now it 's a period piece , but I think it brings back that feeling of youth exulting in its own energies and of young men calling for an end to the war and the destruction of the earth . " <p> Arpino sits back and grins as he relates a recent conversation with Mayor Richard M. Daley about a permanent facility for the Joffrey . <p> " He said he was really proud of the company , and the fact that Chicago finally has a world-class ballet company , " Arpino said . " And then he asked me how the building plans were going . I said , ' Mr. Mayor , with all respect , I think I should be asking you about that . ' And he smiled and said , ' I know you held out all this time without any help and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , we 're going to help you . ' " <p> Until then , the plastic will remain pinned to the studio ceiling .
