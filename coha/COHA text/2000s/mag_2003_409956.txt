( See page 4 . ) To celebrate the 20th anniversary of this fellowship program , in which 234 artists have participated , the Museum of American Glass at Wheaton Village , organized " 20/20 Vision , " an exhibit comprising 103 works by 105 former and current CG CA fellows ( Junel , 2003-January 4 ) . The exhibit was selected by Susanne K. Frantz , former Curator of Modern Glass at the Corning Museum of Glass , from entries submitted at the center 's invitation .

KAREN LAMONTE , 1991 and 2002 Fellow-Dress Diptych , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo/ Gabriel Urbanek . " I returned several times to Karen LaMonte 's ghostly Dress Diptych . The paired images of a crushed and flattened costume-realized in low-relief cast glass and as a monoprint-may be read with a jillion associations and interpretations . It brings to mind antique memorials , the tenuousness of identity and the ever-present possibility of abandonment . The symbolism of compression and weight ties literally to the realities of the printmaking process . " Photograph // SUSAN BANE HOLLAND , 1994 Fellow-Fade , 2001 , blown and flameworked glass , 20 by 8 by 8 inches , in collaboration with Boyd Sugiki , Michael Schunke , Laura Ward , photo/James Beards . " Susan Holland 's work is only predictable in that it is always fascinating . Fade was constructed over the course of a week by Holland and a group of assisting friends . Her sculptures often incorporate textsometimes repeated , sometimes buried in the glass and indecipherable , but always related to the form . Holland writes that Fade is aboutthe way eyes respond to the optical illusion of an " afterimage " ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 seconds or longer , then looking at a neutral background ) . The inscriptions come from Goethe 's analysis of the read justment of sight and the gradua ! disappearance of the afterimage : The edge begins to be blue ... the blue gradually encroaches inward ... the image then becomes gradually fainter . ' The words form a trompe l'oeil swirl that seems to cling to the surface and wind around the disappearing cone of glass ribbons . " Photograph Photograph // BETH LIPMAN , 2001 Fellow-Dead Birds ( afterFrans Cuyck Van Myerop ) , 2002 , sculpted glass , mixed media , 36 by 30 by 8 inches , photo/Eva Heyd . " Beth Lipman 's Dead Birds ( after Frans Cuyck Van Myeroplis a high point of the exhibition . In addition to being visually stunning , this piece has so many other aspects to consider . Liprrian has translated a highly realistic , 17th-century Flemish painting into a milk glass tableau . The restricted palette , like that of the original painting , is as severe as a Dutch church interior . Photo-realism is replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance . The fowl hang within a funereal black border . Drained of color and freed of detail , the upended birds allude even more poignantly to the potential beauty of martyrdom and sacrifice . " Photograph // ALISON CHISM , 1998 Fellow- Thing , 2002 , blown glass , 11 by 6 by 5 inches . " The liplessred gullet of Thing provoked another Oh boy ! ' response . This thing is n't just any old floppy bubble of colorful blown glass . all of the mystery of the sea-the ooze and the algae-is contained in one little gaping bag . Somehow it melds the sweet expression of a newborn with the alarmed mouthing of a fish gulping for air . It also displays the delicate coloration arid curves of both an internal organ and a Russel Wright gravy boat . As such , it is irresistible . " <p>
