1 Every black-and-white to be spared had come , seven of the ten on graveyard , drawn in once the watch commander broke the Code 33 . Dennis Murchison studied the crowd while his partner , Jerry Stluka , parked their unmarked Crown Victoria as close as he could . Onlookers gathered in the battering strobes of colored light . Even though the rain had stopped , umbrellas sprouted here and there . On the perimeter , one older couple , decked in bathrobes and slippers , clutched their pajamas to their throats and craned on tiptoe to see . Murchison and Stluka pulled out their IDs , put the tabs into their jacket pockets so the badges showed , then drew latex gloves from the dispenser on the dash . Stluka , eyeing the crowd , said , " Am I free to assume this officially kicks off Black History Month ? " He was sable-haired , muscular , compact . A build referred to as pyknic , Murchison had learned once doing a crossword puzzle . " Got any pills you can take , stem the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth , a hard , thin whistling sound . " Yeah . Keep ' em with the antiwhining tablets . Want one ? " He stretched his glove tight . " Who 's I-C ? " " Holmes . " Stluka cackled . " Sherlock ! " Murchison took stock of the faces swinging their way . Young men mostly , some with eyes like stones , full of what-the-fuck and who-are-you . " Once we get inside the tape , do me a favor . Lay off the Sherlock bit . Think you can do that ? " Stluka groaned . The pain of it . " Seems to me we could stand to lighten up a little . Get a sense of humor . You want , I could call him Maid Marion like they used to down around Dumpers substation . " " Oh yeah.That 'll work . " " Hey -- you want to be treated like one among equals , you take the damn chip off your shoulder . " " Whose shoulder ? I 'm the one asking . " Stluka made a little wave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . You ? " They got out of the car and eased their way though the crowd from the back , checking faces . Murchison noted a player or two , known thugs , but that was hardly strange . They lived up here . One guy gripped an open Mickeys , talking smack into a cell phone . Others had their dogs in tow , pits and rotts . The animals strained against their chain leashes , sniffing the air . They 'd caught the scent of the victim 's blood . Hennessey , who had the hill for patrol that night , stood in the middle of the street , ducking under one neighbor 's umbrella as he jotted down her words . The woman wore pink sweats beneath a yellow slicker , bare feet in flip flops , her hair coiled meticulously into French braids . Murchison came up , placed a hand on the officer 's arm , and said quietly , " Hennessey Tennessee , toodle your flute . " The man was big , Irish -- priestly eyes , wastrel grin . " Murch , hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Detective Murchison ? Marcellyne Pathon . " She had high cheekbones in a round , childlike face . Behind thick horn-rims her brown eyes ballooned . She shook Murchison 's hand . Her skin felt warm , her palm damp , not from rain . Nearby , a few young toughs in the crowd drifted back , far enough not to get dragged in , not so far as to leave earshot . " She lives across the way . " Hennessey pointed with his pen . Two little girls stood holding hands in the window , silhouettes , peering out at their mother . " Says she heard the shots , they woke her up , but --  " " Did n't see nobody . " It came out quick . She adjusted her glasses . " I went to the window , you know , looked out , but --  " A shrug . " All dark out here , you know ? " " Your children hear anything ? " Murchison nodded toward her house . Like that , she stiffened . " No , sir . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed already . Got church tomorrow . " " How about a car ? Hear one ? See one ? " She took in a long , slow breath , thinking it through . " No , sir . Do n't remember no car . " Her eyes held steady behind the Coke bottle lenses . " Any voices , shouts , an argument ? " " No , sir . It was the shots , like sudden . Just them . Rest was real quiet . Especially for a Saturday . The storm , I figure . " " Mr. Carlisle hard to get along with ? " She recoiled just a little , as though accused . " How you mean ? " " Just trying to get an idea of who the man was , Marcellyne . " Her face relaxed a little , and she gave the question long consideration . She seemed conflicted . " What Mr. Carlisle was , was big -- know what I 'm saying ? Spoke his mind . Stand back when he did , okay ? But he was no trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The other neighbors . Any tension ? " Nearby , one guy with a dog craned to listen in . Hennessey edged over , herded him and his animal back . " Not with me . Not with folks I know . " Her eyes skittered around . Her voice quavered . " Have to ask them , I suppose . " Murchison nodded , glanced around at the nearest faces . Eyes fled his gaze . " Okay , Marcellyne . Great . Thank you . I 'll get back in touch if I think we need some follow-up , okay ? " He did n't wait for her reply , but drew away , at the same time pulling Hennessey with him , turning him so their backs faced the crowd . " This is your usual area up here , am I right ? " Hennessey shrugged . The polyester shoulders of his uniform beaded with rain . " Normally , yeah . Sure . Trade off from time to time -- Brickyards , Dumpers -- but I know the lay of the land pretty good up here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hennessey did n't have to look . " Here and there . But you know how it is . You 're not a fuckup or his family , I do n't know you . " From far back in the crowd , a voice shouted , " Pig white po-po motherfuckers ! " Murchison did n't bother to look . " You 've got your Polaroid in the trunk ? " " Checked it out beginning of shift , " Hennessey said . " Sure . " Murchison made a pressing gesture with his finger , the shutter button . " Do n't wait , okay ? " Murchison joined up with Stluka just beyond the yellow crime scene tape , strung in a semicircle to keep the crowd back . An ancient sycamore loomed over a tall fence of rain-streaked dogtooth redwood that rimmed the property . A second ribbon of tape festooned the fence like bunting . A uniformed officer named Truax manned the gate , clipboard in hand , keeping the entry/exit log . Murchison took a moment to survey the neighborhood . St. Martin 's Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two neighborhoods divided by a shabby panhandle known for trade . St. Martin 's was generally considered the better locale , working-class and stable , but the spate of foreclosures since the shipyard 's closing had changed that . Quicksilver mines once threaded the hill , part of a rim of upcroppings known extravagantly as the Sierra de Napa according to some old survey maps . Below , the Napa River flowed out from the salt marshes into San Pablo Bay . Only the western slope of the hill had been developed ; the backside gave way to a broad , weed-choked ravine , former site of several sleeper mines . The ground remained too toxic from mercury for home building . From this side of the range , though , on a clear night , glancing south from the bluff headlands , you could see San Francisco glimmering in the distance , like a wicked dream . Northward , beyond the salt flats , lay vintner paradise , the Napa Valley , with its thousands of acres of fretwork vines and the hundreds of tons of silt load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstream anymore except at high tide . An ecological disaster , those vineyards , but the yuppie-come-latelies could n't love them enough . In daylight , you looked west across the river to the Mayacamas Mountains , the interim distance greened with tidal wetlands riven by waterways -- China Slough , Devil 's Creek , Dutchman Slough . As a boy , Murchison had water-skied those sloughs with his older brother , Willy , breaking an arm once , his brother losing teeth , prelegal teens anesthetized with beer . Once , they 'd traded chugs from a fifth of Four Roses bourbon -- paint thinner with food coloring , basically -- filched from a passed-out fisherman snoring in his boat . The brothers had hunted together , too , looking for ruddies and stiff tails flying in to feed in the tidal pools , jackrabbits darting in and out of the fennel and coyote bush on the salt marsh levees , pheasant flushed out of the artichoke thistle around Five Brooks . Up near Dutton 's Landing they 'd helped buck oat hay for pocket money . After dusk they snuck into The Dream Bowl storeroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traded belches while the spinning tower light at the Napa Airport mesmerized them and they talked about girls they knew . A lifetime ago , all that . As of 1972 , Willy survived only in memory ; you 'd find his name etched in black granite among fifty-eight thousand others on the Mall in D.C. What hunting Murchison got to now concerned men . From time to time , he still felt the need for anesthesia . He turned his eyes back to the immediate surroundings . St. Martin 's laid claim to being one of the few genuinely integrated neighborhoods in town , though halfheartedness more than high-mindedness deserved the credit for that . Haywire zoning had let in the low-rent apartments , and they were nests of trouble . Absentee rentals were a blight . This had driven out a lot of the whites , and almost all the ones left behind worked in the building trades , cast adrift by the shipyard closing , traveling hours up and down the valley now for any work they could find . In truth , the racial tensions in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dozens of other places , though that did n't mean they did n't exist . Just because people intermingled did n't mean they mixed . The same held true for the force . Murchison got along with Black cops all right , or he had before being partnered with Stluka . Now he was an enigma , but he could n't do much about that without undermining his partner , a cardinal sin the way Murchison saw it . Loyalty was a duty , not a bond . Besides , he knew only too well that getting along is n't friendship . And you did n't have to wonder much what secret feelings remained at work beneath the surface of things -- on the force , among ordinary people . As for the folks who lived up here , they did well to know their neighbors beyond hello , regardless of race , and the ones they did know owed that familiarity to trouble -- a men 's rehab center trying to get zoning for ten additional beds ; or the duplex owners who 'd phonied up a permit request , then painted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Here and there , you did still find a family who 'd lived in the same house for decades , but now their children were taking over the property , hoping for a little of that inflation windfall so key to the California dream anymore . Being close to the panhandle , this particular street was mostly Black , though scattered here and there in the crowd Murchison caught a white face . He 'd be interested in Hennessey 's Polaroids . Be interested in which faces Marcellyne Pathon could identify , which ones she could n't . Which ones she would n't . Across the panhandle in Baymont , things got worse . Up top there was a reasonably decent neighborhood called Home in the Sky , built by a man named Jameson Carswell , a local legend -- only Black developer the town had ever seen . In the fifties and sixties he 'd built almost all the new homes owned by African Americans up here , then formed his own finance company to loan out mortgage money when the local banks refused , hoping to ruin him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Old folks , they remembered . Almost everything below that one neighborhood , though , despite the stellar views , qualified for Section 8 . More than shacks , less than houses , they were old federal housing units left behind by World War II , now with add-ons and renovations grandfathered in decade after decade . Shabby apartment buildings and four-room prefabs set onto concrete slab pretty much finished the picture . Patrol units seldom ventured over into Baymont for so much as a barking dog except in teams of three . Narrow winding streets snaked downhill among eucalyptus trees and Monterey pines so ratty and thick with duff they almost qualified as tinder . At the bottom , where the panhandle ended , the streets on that side converged with those from over here on St. Martin's -- it was the only way in or out of either neighborhood , another relic of the federal housing plan . Traffic bottlenecked down there every morning and every night . A renovation plan was in the works , but that had been true for thirty years . Beyond the low stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty-five acres of vacant navy row houses sat empty . They 'd been targeted for condo conversion -- a contractor had the plans approved for 250 town houses , model units were due for completion early next year -- but then cost overruns for heating and electrical upgrades halted work , or so they said . Meanwhile the project just sat there , inviting the worst . To the south along the river , the warehouse district began . Boxcars tagged with graffiti turned to rust in the rail yards . Piles of pumice and concrete powder , heaped along the loading docks , sent gritty dust clouds sailing through town , ruining paint jobs and prompting asthma attacks . The night trade down there , among the warehouses , made the action up here on the hill look like church . That 's where you found the lion 's share of meth labs and crack houses and shooting galleries -- if you found them . They roamed spot to spot , week by week , to avoid crackdowns , and even with federal HIDTA money , the force had yet to build up the manpower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't the bikers did , the two sides negotiating truces only money could explain . Beyond that lay Dumpers and the rest of southtown , absentee rentals again , a lot of Section 8 . Live there , you inhaled mold through your walls and looked out at the street through metal bars . What you saw , more than likely , day or night , was hookers working twists along the side streets off the truck route . Come morning , if you ventured very far outside , you had to watch your step to avoid the spent rubbers . The whole town had started to backslide when the first big wave of parolees came back to town , trying to reclaim what parts of the street trade they 'd surrendered when they 'd gone inside . Crime rates were ticking upward again . Six murders already this year , first week of February . Six murders and fifteen fires , in an overgrown town . A community in transition , some bow-tied consultant hired by the mayor 's office had called it . Turning back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood fence just to see a rim of roofline . The upper tip of an addition appeared near the back . Raggedy plum trees flanked the yard .
