Chapter One Three months later " This is a big mistake , Eve . Big ! You ca n't leave yet ; you 're not ready . " Anna Maria , in a bathrobe , fuzzy slippers , and no makeup , was chasing Eve down the driveway of her home . " Watch me . " Eve was n't going to get into it with Anna again . Not now . It was morning , barely light , the street lamps still offering some bit of illumination as dawn crept down the manicured street of this suburb tucked between Marietta and Atlanta . Time to leave . Holding a cigarette in one hand and a cup of sloshing coffee in the other , Anna somehow managed to keep up with her sister-in-law . " You 're not through with physical therapy , you ca n't remember jackshit about the night you were attacked , and for God 's sake , there 's a rumor , probably a good one , that Cole Dennis is going to be released . Did you hear me ? The man you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the mention of Cole 's name , Eve 's heart clutched . Just as it always did . And she ignored it . Just like she always did . " We 've had this argument a kazillion times . I need to get home . " Lugging a cat carrier , Eve made her way to her Camry as Samson , her long-haired stray , howled from within . " No matter what you think , you 're not dying , " she assured the unhappy animal as she scrounged in her purse for her keys with her free hand . The carrier bobbed wildly , and Samson , freaked out of his mind , hissed loudly . She placed the plastic crate on the driveway near the back tire of her car as she kept searching for the damned keys . " Eve- " " Do n't start . " Glancing up at her sister-in-law , Eve shook her head , short strands of hair brushing the back of her neck . " You know I have to leave . " She managed to slide her key ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cell phone , tangled in the keys , popped out of the purse and dropped onto the concrete , landing with a sickening smack . " Oh great ! " Just what she needed ; another reason for Anna , supposedly a devout Roman Catholic but as superstitious as anyone Eve had ever met , to find an excuse for Eve to linger . It amazed Eve how Anna was forever seeing " curses , " " signs , " or " omens " in everyday life-so much so that Samson , being a black cat , was nearly banished from Anna and Kyle 's home . " I saw that ! " Anna announced . " God is trying to tell you something . " " Yeah , like I need a new cell-phone carrier , " Eve muttered through clenched teeth . " Not funny , Eve . " " You 're wrong . It was really funny . " She managed a smile and looked up at her sister-in-law as dark clouds , heavy with the promise of rain , moved slowly across a low Georgia sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of a magnolia tree growing close to the drive , but it was enough to cool the sweat that was already sprouting on Eve 's neck and spine . Picking up the phone , she saw that the screen was still illuminated . Hitting the speakerphone button , she heard the familiar hum of a dial tone . " Still working . Guess I wo n't have to switch networks . " She tucked the phone more securely into a pocket of her purse , unlocked the door , and slid the cat carrier onto the backseat . " For the record , I 'm against this , " Anna said , her arms crossed beneath her large breasts . " For the record , I know . " " You could at least wait until Kyle gets home . He just ran out for milk and cigarettes . He 'll be back any minute . " All the more reason to leave . Eve and her oldest brother had never gotten along . Having her camp out at his house while recovering from a gunshot wound and trauma-induced amnesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking me out of this , so do n't even try . Nita says I 'm eighty-five percent of normal , whatever that is . " " Nita 's an idiot . " Anna Maria took a long drag on her cigarette and shot smoke out of the side of her mouth . " Nita 's a board-certified physical therapist . " " What does your shrink say ? " Eve paused . " Low blow , Anna . " She 'd quit going to the psychiatrist after just three sessions . She had n't " clicked " with him and knew enough about psychiatry to realize a patient had to trust in her doctor completely . She did n't . Dr. Calvin Byrd was too guarded , too quiet , too studious . The way he 'd leaned back in his chair , pen in hand , as she 'd confided in him had given her a bad feeling . She 'd felt as if he were more interested in judging her than healing or helping her . So she 'd quit the sessions . She 'd been around enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Was n't her own father proof enough of that ? Not to mention that she herself had been working on her PhD in psychology before her life had been shattered at that cabin in the woods . Bottom line : no doctor should make a patient nervous . " He might be able to help you with your memory , " Anna argued . " I told you , I do n't like him . End of story . " " He 's well respected . One of the best psychiatrists in Atlanta . " " I know . " Eve had seen all the degrees , awards , and letters of commendation so proudly displayed in Dr. Byrd 's office . " It 's personal-just a gut feeling . " She was already walking back to the house , to the breezeway , where her luggage was stacked . Eve passed by her brother 's work van-a dirty paneled truck with the predictable words WASH ME scribbled into the dust on the back windows . Obviously he 'd taken his Porsche for his morning run to the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this anymore . You can either help me load up the car or stand there and rant and rave to no good end . So what 's it going to be ? " " This is nuts , Eve . " Eve smiled gently . " Oh , come on . Things are n't that bad . " " Not that bad ? For the love of God ! When did you become such a Pollyanna ? You were shot . Shot ! The bullet hit your shoulder and ricocheted to your temple , and your brain was bruised . Bruised . You did n't end up dead or paralyzed or God only knows what else , but pul-eeze do n't tell me things are n't bad . I know better . " Anna took a long drag on her cigarette and glared at her sister-in-law over the glowing tip . " You were almost killed . By that son of a bitch you thought you might marry ! C'm on , Eve . Things are definitely ' that bad ' and probably a helluva lot worse . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with arguing , Eve picked up a duffel bag and her computer case , then started hauling them back to the Camry , where Samson was crying loud enough to wake the dead . Yes , she had big holes in her memory . But her amnesia was n't complete . She did recall bits from that night . Painful little shards that cut through her brain . She remembered being late . She remembered seeing Roy lying on the floor , bleeding out , barely hanging on to life . She remembered the bloody number 212 scrawled on the wall . She remembered reaching for her cell phone , hesitating , her fingers shaking too badly to dial , dropping the damned thing , seeing NO SERVICE in bold letters against a glowing LCD . She remembered seeing the gun leveled through the window before it went off . And she remembered blood . Everywhere . Splattered on the wall , pooling on the floor , making the touch pad of her cell phone sticky , oozing from Roy 's neck and forehead ... She closed her eyes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurking , loomed again . Deep , dark and deadly . It ate at her at night . Cut through her dreams . If only she 'd been at the cabin earlier as she 'd promised , if only she had n't hesitated or dropped her phone before dialing 911 , her friend Roy might still be alive .... Shaking inside , she opened her eyes to the somber morning . The clouds overhead seemed even more ominous . " The doctors think my memory will return , " Eve said as she reached her car and tossed the duffel onto the floor of the backseat . She slid her computer next to the cat carrier . She noticed Samson , pupils dilated , glaring through the tiny windows of the crate . " Maybe getting your memory back is n't a good thing . " Boy , was Anna on a tear this morning . First one side of the argument , then the other . Eve tossed her purse onto the front passenger seat then turned to find her sister-in-law standing within inches of her . " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down because of trauma , to protect itself ? " Anna pushed her long hair from her eyes . She was close enough that Eve smelled the smoke and coffee on her breath , the hint of perfume clinging to her skin . " Maybe you do n't want to know what happened . " " I want to know , " Eve responded evenly . Across the street , a door opened . In a striped terry robe and slippers , a balding man pushing eighty stepped onto his porch and shot a glance their way from behind thick glasses . He sketched out a wave then bent to retrieve his newspaper . " Morning , Mr. Watters , " Anna said , waving back as her neighbor scanned the headlines and disappeared inside . She lowered her voice and moved closer to Eve . " I 'm just asking you to wait . A week . Maybe two . ' Til you 're stronger , and maybe by then we 'll know what Cole is up to . Stay here until we 're certain you 're safe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eve had already started up the drive again . " Besides , I 'm thinking of getting a dog ... a puppy . " Anna Maria took a final hit on her Virginia Slim and sent it to the concrete of the driveway , where she stomped the butt out with her pink mule . " A puppy ? Like that 'll keep the bad guys at bay ! " " I 'm talking about a really , really tough puppy . " There was n't the slightest hint of humor in Anna 's worried eyes . " Look , Eve , you can laugh and make light about this all you want , but the bottom line is : someone tried to kill you . " " I was at the wrong place at the wrong time . " Anna tossed her an exasperated look . " You think it was Cole . You were going to testify that he shot you . And now ... now they expect him to be released from prison . The whole case against him has fallen apart . But that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , did n't he ? When he was out on bail ? He called . Planned to meet with you , and you , being some kind of idealistic numbskull , were actually going to see him ! What the hell were you thinking ? " Eve 's stomach knotted . The headache that never seemed to quite go away began to beat slowly inside her skull . She did n't want to think about all this again . " Cole thought you were having an affair . Probably with Roy . " Anxiety clamped over Eve 's lungs . The truth of the matter was that she could n't remember . Her headache thundered . " Damn it all . " She found her purse in the car , scrounged through a zippered pocket , came up with a nearly empty bottle of ibuprofen , and tossed two pills into her mouth . " I told you , I do n't want to rehash this . I 'm done arguing . " She grabbed Anna 's cup and washed down the tablets with a swallow of tepid , milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna snagged her cup . Feeling a tic develop beneath her eye , Eve sensed another panic attack in the making . Her heart was racing , and she felt as if her lungs were strapped by steel bands . Not now . Not here . A full-blown anxiety attack will only add fuel to Anna Maria 's **25;224;TOOLONG fire .... One ... Breathe ! ... Two ... Think calm thoughts .... Three ... Slow your heartbeat .... Four ... By the time she reached ten , she was taking normal breaths again , but Anna was watching her closely . " I got ta go . " Eve grabbed her makeup kit , not that it would do much good . Her face was still a bit puffy , the plastic surgery around her right eye not quite healed . She placed the makeup bag beside the cat carrier , then turned to reach for her large roller-bag . " Okay , fine . Hey ! No ! Stop ! For God 's sake , do n't lift that . Just wait a sec , will ya ? " Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus , this weighs a ton . What 've you got in here , lead weights ? " Eve smiled faintly . " At least you did n't say a dead body . " " I thought about it . " " I know you did . " From within the interior of the car came the pitiful sound of a cat who thought he was being tortured . " Wo n't that drive you nuts ? " Anna asked . " Probably . " Eve flipped up the lid of the trunk . " But I 'll survive . " " You know you 're impossible , do n't you ? As stubborn as your brothers . " Anna refused Eve 's help as she hoisted the bag into the trunk . " And do n't give me any of that crap about you not being from the same genetic pool as Kyle and Van . It does n't matter . You were all raised under the same roof , and that 's why you 're all so bullheaded . " Eve had given up arguing . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got going . Logic did n't count , and the fact that Eve 's older brothers were from their mother 's first marriage , that they were twelve and ten years old when Eve , as an infant , was adopted by Melody and Terrence Renner , was n't going to change Anna 's mind . Eve suspected that the only reason she 'd ended up living with Kyle and Anna after being released from the hospital was that Anna Maria had insisted upon it . It had n't been any bit of brotherly love , or nobility , or even guilt on Kyle 's part . Anna picked up her cup , took a swallow , and scowled . " You 're right . This is really bad . " She tossed the dregs into the dirt beneath the magnolia tree . " Told you . " " So , if you 're going to go , " Anna said , glancing up at the menacing sky , " go already . And Eve ? " " Yeah ? " " Avoid Cole . He 's just plain bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the answer I want to hear . " Anna wrapped her arms around Eve and held her tight , as if she did n't want to let go , and Eve wondered if it was because she was worried for Eve or because she did n't want to be left alone with her husband . Eve knew only too well what a brooding , moody tyrant her oldest brother could be . The fact that Anna had never bent to Kyle 's will or had let him break her spirit was testament to her strength . " Take care of yourself , Anna , " Eve whispered emotionally . " Thanks for everything . I owe you ! " " I 'll try . You too . " Before the whole scene got any more difficult , Eve extracted herself from Anna 's embrace , slid behind the wheel of her car , ignored the yowling cat , and fired up the engine . " Bye ! " Anna was already reaching into her pocket for her pack of cigarettes . She shook out the last one before crumpling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops of rain began to pepper the ground . Just what she needed . She had over four hundred miles of asphalt between here and New Orleans . And once you get there , then what ? " God only knows . " She flipped on the wipers and pressed her toe to the accelerator . To drown out Samson 's mournful cries , she turned on the radio , found a country station , and wondered which was worse , the wailing guitar or the unhappy cat . The rest of her life , whatever that was going to be , was waiting . * * * " Get me the hell out of here ! " Cole Dennis paced from one end of the small holding cell to the other . He was tense . Agitated . This tiny room , with its scarred cinder-block walls and steel bars , smelled of must , dirt , and broken dreams . Worse yet , beneath the strong odor of some pine-scented cleaner was the whiff of ammonia and urine , as if the someone who 'd been here last had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or maybe he 'd pissed on purpose to mark his territory or just make a defiant , in-your-face point to the cops . Cole 's attorney , Sam Deeds , was seated at the simple table that was bolted to the floor . Impeccable in an Armani suit , a silk tie , and a haircut that cost what some men made in a month , Deeds looked the part of the slick attorney : clean shaven and hawkeyed , his expression serious , his dark eyes missing nothing as Cole paced from one end of the cell to the other . How many times had Cole himself sat in that very chair , dressed like Deeds , telling his client not to sweat , never once noticing the odor of desperation that clung to these chipped walls ? " We 're just waiting for all the paperwork . You know the drill , " Deeds said . " Like hell . They 're stalling . And why am I locked in here ? I 'm supposed to be getting out . This is an interrogation room , for God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So this is for my protection ? So that I 'm hidden from the press ? " Cole snorted his contempt . " Bullshit ! " " Cool it . " Deeds tossed a look to the large mirror on one side of the room as if in silent reminder about the two-way glass . Cole shut up . He knew all about the mirror and about the pricks standing on the other side watching him squirm , hoping against hope that there was some way to nail his hide for the Royal Kajak murder . Jesus , what a mess . He shoved one hand through his hair and felt warm drops of sweat on his scalp . Just like he 'd seen hundreds of times on the poor sons of bitches that he 'd represented .
