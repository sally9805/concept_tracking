The dream began with the sound of wings . In retrospect I realize I <br> should have known that was a bad sign , what with the Raven <br> Mockers being set loose and all , but in my dream it was just background <br> noise , kinda like a fan whirring or the TV turned on to the <br> QVC . In my dream I was standing in the middle of a beautiful meadow . <br> It was night , but there was an enormous full moon hovering just <br> above the trees that framed the meadow . It cast a silver blue light <br> strong enough to throw shadows and made everything look like it <br> was underwater , an impression that was strengthened by the gentle <br> breeze blowing the soft grasses against my bare legs in sweeps and <br> whirls like waves lapping sweetly against a shore . That same wind was <br> lifting my thick dark hair from my naked shoulders and it felt like silk <br> floating against my skin . Bare legs ? Naked shoulders ? I looked down and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a <br> seriously short buckskin minidress . The top of it was cut in a wide <br> V , front and back , so that it hung off my shoulders , leaving lots of <br> skin visible . The dress itself was amazing . It was white and decorated <br> with fringe , feathers , and shells and seemed to glow in the moonlight . <br> All over it was beaded with intricate designs that were impossibly <br> beautiful . My imagination is so darn cool ! The dress tickled a memory , but I ignored it . I did n't want to think <br> too hard  --  I was dreaming ! Instead of pondering dTja vu moments I <br> danced gracefully through the meadow , wondering if Zac Efron or <br> even Johnny Depp was going to suddenly appear and flirt outrageously <br> with me . <br> I peeked around as I twirled and swayed with the wind and thought <br> I saw the shadows flicker and move oddly within the massive trees . I <br> stopped and was trying to squint so I could get a closer look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and my weird dreams , I 'd <br> created bottles of brown pop hanging from the limbs like bizarre fruit , <br> just waiting for me to pick them . That 's when he appeared . At the edge of the meadow , just inside the shadows of the trees , a <br> shape materialized . I could see his body because the moonlight <br> caught the smooth , naked lines of his skin . Naked ? I stopped . Had my imagination lost its mind ? I was n't really up <br> to frolicking around a meadow with a naked guy , even if he was the <br> amazingly mysterious Mr. Johnny Depp . " You hesitate , my love ? " At the sound of his voice a shiver passed through my body , and <br> terrible , mocking laughter whispered through the leaves of the trees . <br> " Who are you ? " I was glad that my dream voice did n't betray the <br> fear I was feeling . His laughter was as deep and beautiful as his voice , and as frightening . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it drifted almost <br> visible in the air around me . " Do you pretend you do not know me ? " His voice brushed against my body , making the little hairs on my <br> arms stand up . " Yeah , I know you . I made you up . This is my dream . You 're a mixture <br> of Zac and Johnny . " I hesitated , peering at him . I spoke nonchalantly <br> even though my heart was beating like crazy because it was <br> already obvious this guy was not a mixture of those two actors . " Well , <br> maybe you 're Superman or Prince Charming , " I said , reaching for <br> anything but the truth . " I am no figment of your imagination . You know me . Your soul knows <br> me . " I had n't moved my feet , but my body was slowly being drawn toward <br> him , like his voice was pulling me . I reached him and looked <br> up and up . . . It was Kalona . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I <br> just had n't wanted to admit it to myself . How could I have dreamed <br> him ? Nightmare  --  this had to be a nightmare and not a dream . His body was naked , but it was n't completely substantial . His <br> form wavered and shifted in time with the caressing breeze . Behind <br> him , in the dark green shadows of the trees , I could see the ghostly <br> shapes of his children , the Raven Mockers , as they clung to the limbs <br> with the hands and feet of men and stared at me with men 's eyes <br> from the mutated faces of birds . <br> " Do you still claim not to know me ? " His eyes were dark  --  a starless sky . They seemed the most substantial <br> thing about him . That and his liquid voice . Even though this <br> is a nightmare , it 's still mine . I can just wake up ! I want to wake up ! I <br> want to wake up ! But I did n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . He 'd built <br> this dream , this dark , nightmare meadow , and somehow brought me <br> there , closing the door to reality behind us . " What do you want ? " I said the words quickly so he could n't hear <br> my voice shaking . " You know what I want , my love . I want you . " " I am not your love . " " Of course you are . " He moved this time , stepping so close to me <br> that I could feel the chill that came from his unsubstantial body . " My <br> A-ya . " A-ya had been the name of the maiden the Cherokee Wise Womenhad created to trap him centuries ago . Panic spiked through me . " I 'm <br> not A-ya ! " " You command the elements , " his voice was a caress , awful and <br> wonderful , compelling and terrifying . " Gifts from my Goddess , " I said . " Once before you commanded the elements . You were made from <br> them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred and lifted . <br> Beating forward softly , they enfolded me in a spectral embrace that <br> was cold as frost . " No ! You must have me mixed up with someone else . I 'm not A-ya . " " You 're wrong , my love . I feel her within you . " His wings pressed against my body , drawing me closer to him . <br> Even though his physical form was only semi-substantial , I could <br> feel him . His wings were soft . Winter cold against the warmth of <br> my dreaming self . The outline of his body was frigid mist . It burned <br> my skin , sending electric currents through me , heating me with a desire <br> I did n't want to feel but was powerless to resist . His laugh was seductive . I wanted to drown in it . I leaned forward , <br> closing my eyes and gasping aloud as the chill of his spirit brushed <br> against my breasts , sending shooting sensations that were painful <br> but deliciously erotic to places in my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You like the pain . It brings you pleasure . " His wings got more insistent , <br> his body harder and colder and more passionately painful as <br> it pressed against mine . " Surrender to me . " His voice , already beautiful , <br> was unimaginably seductive as he became aroused . " I spent centuries <br> in your arms . This time our joining will be controlled by me , and <br> you will revel in the plea sure I can bring you . Throw off the shackles of <br> your distant goddess and come to me . Be my love , truly , in body as well <br> as soul and I will give you the world ! " The meaning of his words penetrated through the haze of pain and <br> pleasure like sunlight burning away dew . I found my will again , and <br> stumbled out of the embrace of his wings . Tendrils of icy black smoke <br> snaked around my body , clinging . . . touching . . . caressing . . . I shook myself like a pissed cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body . " No ! I 'm not your love . I 'm not A-ya . And <br> I 'll never turn my back on Nyx ! " When I spoke Nyx 's name , the nightmare shattered . <br> I sat straight up in bed , shaking and gasping . Stevie Rae was sleeping <br> soundly beside me , but Nala was wide awake . She was growling <br> softly . Her back was arched , her body was totally puffed up , and she <br> was staring slit- eyed at the air above me . " Ah , hell ! " I shrieked and bounded off the bed , spinning around <br> and looking up , expecting to see Kalona hovering like a giant batbird <br> over us . Nothing . There was nothing there . I grabbed Nala and sat on the bed . With trembling hands I petted <br> her over and over . " It was just a bad dream . . . it was just a bad <br> dream . . . it was just a bad dream , " I told her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was real , and somehow he was able to reach me through <br> my dreams .
