<p> We can all learn from coach Dews ' example <p> I read Michelle Hiskey 's article on Braves bullpen coach Bobby Dews with great interest ( " A : Lifetime of Dews , " Sports , Aug. 6 ) . He has an enthusiasm for life that is hard to find these days . So many of us are always hunting for the negative in people , places and things , that in our minds , we usually find them . Dews has kept a positive attitude toward life in general , overcoming obstacles that many of us share in one way or another . <p> Dews has learned through his recovery from alcoholism , as I have , that you go through a spiritual change during this process . A lot of it has to do with a " Higher Power greater than oneself . " We can change our attitudes toward our perceived problems with the help from this power . The willingness to honestly assess our difficulties and the openmindedness to accept a different way of dealing with them are the basics for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dews has shown his wiilingness to change and grow emotionally , intellectually and , most important , spiritually . God bless you , Bobby , and keep on writing . <p> SAM HEARD , Cumming <p> Waging war : Israel 's right to exist central issue <p> All the recent braying in the AJC by Jay Bookman , Jimmy Carter ( " Carter calls U.S. Mideast policy ' erroneous , ' " News , Aug. 6 ) and numerous letter writers can be reduced to one simple question : Does Israel have a right to exist or not ? If Israel has that right , then Bush 's policy is right on target  --  full support for the Israelis in their ongoing struggle with their Arab neighbors who wo n't accept their miniscule presence . <p> The bottom line is that every country in the world was created by taking land from some other group , whether by purchase , squatting or forced removal . In Israel , much of the land was purchased by the Zionists prior to 1946 ; the rest was abandoned by the Palestinians during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other " new " countries , such as Pakistan , Bangladesh and Eritrea , were formed through civil war . Where is the moral outrage regarding these countries ? <p> BRUCE MYERS , Lilburn <p> Do n't forget cost to our troops <p> With the lack of graphic visual images in the media displaying the true horrors of war to the American people , I would like to encourage the Journal-Constitution to print more front-page stories like that of Spc . Rodney Davidson ( " To war again , with memories , " Page One , Aug. 6 ) . These articles show us the pain and atrocities our troops endure that most of us only face in nightmares . Yet for our troops there is no waking from these nightmares of war , even after returning home . <p> News coverage of this human cost of war reminds us that for those who do return from Iraq or Afghanistan physically unharmed , as with Davidson , there will still be devastating scars inside that may never heal . We owe it to our troops to be aware of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <p> CRAIG MICHAEL BECK , Conyers <p> Use of innocents simply cowardly <p> A recent column ( " Slam terrorists ' use of human shields , " @issue , Aug. 6 ) does not go far enough in its framing of those who would use civilians as shields or as targets . " Terrorists , " " freedom fighters " ( call them what you will ) , whether they are Muslim , Christian , Arab , Irish or American , should be labeled by the international news media for what they are  --  despicable cowards . <p> EDWARD MARTIN , Peachtree City <p> Situation grim , at home and abroad <p> Let 's see . Hezbollah kidnaps two Israeli soldiers in an act of terrorism . Israel wants them back . Hezbollah commences to fire poorly aimed missiles into Israel , killing innocent folk , not military targets , etc . Israel , as it has been forced to do many times since the U.N . mandate which created the country , attempts to fight back against the aggression . <p> As usual , listening to the brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zion , " we blame the Israelis for all of the problems . With this crap going on we are not only losing many lives  --  all Semites  --  but on both sides we are losing the propaganda wars . <p> Oh yes , Congress goes off on a month-plus vacation so that the Republicans can get re-elected and we can continue on the disaster that we have started . <p> Our grandchildren will help our children pay for the mess that has been created . We just hope that China does n't foreclose on the mortgage they hold on us . <p> BILL HURST , Dunwoody <p> Gay men would uphold institute of marriage <p> After reading the article " Middle-aged , no degree , no wife " ( News , Aug. 6 ) , I feel compelled to emphasize that the statistics cited in the story blame factors such as the greater economic independence of women and dwindling prospects in the labor market for the decline in marriage for 18 percent to 22 percent of men 35-44 years of age . This factual report did not blame homosexual relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no relevance . <p> It is important to point out that 20 percent of the gay men in this country have built stable , loving families that include children . Why do our legislatures continue to deny marriage rights to a group of men who would strengthen the institution of marriage in this country and use that equality to protect their families ? <p> KEN MANFORD , Roswell <p> Democratic Party : Responses to Jim Wooten column " Democrats ' soul on line in two races , " @issue , Aug. 6 <p> What about Republican Party 's soul ? <p> I 'd like to thank Jim Wooten for his advice in his Sunday column on saving the soul of the Democratic Party . In the same spirit of bipartisan concern , I would like to point out to him that the soul of his own Republican Party is increasingly jeopardized by the corruption , greed , torture and incompetence that Republicans have tolerated and enabled over the past six years with President Bush . <p> Before you get too upset over the mote in your brother 's eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about that great big beam in your own . <p> BRYAN P. SOROHAN , Gainesville <p> Time to admit Bush made mistake <p> If I read the tea leaves behind the lines in Jim Wooten 's column , it does n't matter if Iraq is on the brink of civil war  --  leftist Democrats are wrong and Republicans are right by " staying the course . " <p> Almost 3,000 of our guys killed and countless maimed for life . What will it take for Wooten to go on record and admit Bush 's mistake ? It 's because of our being in Iraq that Iran and Syria , perceiving Bush 's weakness , started the conflict with Israel . It just sickens me when I see Iraqis marching in support of Hezbollah and burning the American flag . <p> We leftist Democrats remember President Bush telling the American people in our going into Iraq that we would be welcomed with open arms . Some welcome ! <p> NORMAN WISHMAN , Norcross <p> Good riddance to Democrat Lieberman <p> Jim Wooten opined that if the Democrats bounced U.S. Sen. Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true colors . Well , red , white and blue are still my colors , but I 'm glad " Bush Lovin ' Joe " is gone . The world wo n't miss Lieberman , but his loss does spotlight the growing divide between many Jews and the Democratic Party . <p> Take for example Atlanta 's Bernie Marcus ' very public gifts to the Republican Party . I speculate that moderates such as Marcus have drifted to the GOP not just because of tax policy , but because they see the GOP as more hawkish on the Middle East . But the sad reality is that President Bush is no friend of Jews or Israel , having destabilized the region disastrously with his heedless policies . President Carter 's characterization of the Bush Middle East policy as " erroneous " sums it up . <p> If the GOP wants to support Israel , a bold plan for peace would aid it far more than wars that inflame and embolden our enemies . Peace is the moral authority that Israel needs , not war and retaliation . Peace is the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get that . <p> TOM ELLICOTT , Atlanta <p> Slain Morehouse student : Failure to call 911 ca n't be forgiven <p> I see that for one or two of the alleged participants in the senseless robbery/torture/murder of Morehouse College student Carlnell James Walker Jr. , coercion may have been involved ( " Morehouse tries to learn from tragedy , " Metro , Aug. 6 ) . While that may somewhat mitigate their participation , it in no way excuses their utter disregard of human life if events as described by authorities actually took place . Even if it was n't their idea , and/or they did n't fully participate in the beatings , their alleged failure to make a simple call to 911 , once away from the scene , would be unforgivable . <p> If what we 're told is true , they coldly left their " friend " to die in the trunk of a car . Do we really need any louder an alarm to see just how twisted the values of our young people have become ? <p> STEVEN CHARLES , Atlanta <p> Positive things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Atlanta Journal-Constitution continues to buy into the stereotype that anything bad done by one black person reflects negatively on the entire black race , but anything good done by one black person may reflect positively on that person only . <p> People with somewhat tenuous relationships to Morehouse College kill a Morehouse student off campus in another county , and it becomes a repeated headline story . Positive events occur all the time on the Morehouse campus by Morehouse students , and the AJC never mentions it . Repeated wins of the Honda scholastic completion , multiple Rhodes scholars and Phi Beta Kappa students , positive community mentoring , etc. , and not a whimper from the AJC . <p> It 's time the AJC discarded its 1906 reporting and positively embrace the entire community . <p> HARRELL LAWSON , Sparta <p> Africa : Responses to Cynthia Tucker 's column " Zimbabwe can use the grace of intervention , " @issue , Aug. 6 <p> No easy answer in Zimbabwe 's ills <p> If only intervening to end Zimbabwe 's despotic regime were as simple as Cynthia Tucker made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush found out , there are no easy solutions when trying to change a regime . <p> China , a close ally of Zimbabwe , would veto all effective action by the U.N . Security Council . Bogged down in Darfur , the African Union would be unable to send any kind of aid . That leaves only the European Union and the United States to act , but allegations of neocolonialism as well as a strong international dislike of intervention would severely limit support . Robert Mugabe also has a strong army and powerful tribal affiliations  --  is the world prepared to start another guerrilla-style war to get rid of Mugabe ? <p> It is easy to make pleas for action in troubled areas around the world ; it is much more difficult to find a solution that can actually be implemented . <p> CHRIS CHIEGO , Athens <p> South Africa also in midst of crisis <p> Congratulations to Cynthia Tucker for shining a light on Zimbabwe . <p> I lived in neighboring South Africa for 32 years and followed its tragic demise closely . We emigrated to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nelson Mandela , we have watched our native country fall into a similar abyss of corruption and violent crime . The bleak turn of events causes us heartbreak every day . <p> Private South African citizens have taken it upon themselves to reach out internationally via **29;5301;TOOLONG , where their horrendous experiences are described . The current government refuses to issue the actual statistics on crime and rape , and the true situation is rarely reflected in the press . <p> South Africa is hailed as an unforgettable tourist destination . Sure , if you have state-of-the-art security , as Oprah Winfrey does . <p> I hope Tucker will consider writing about another great African country now headed for the big black hole . <p> TERESA DE KOCK , Rome , Ga . <p> Atomic bomb omission <p> In a paragraph dedicated to the 61st anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , it was stated there were more than 200,000 people killed in the two raids ( " Next : A Calendar for the Mind , " @issue , Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these bombings saved untold thousands of lives of American fighting men and shortened the war . <p> RALEIGH CANNON , Roswell <p> Kids are watching athletes who cheat <p> From Barry Bonds to Floyd Landis , the list goes on and on of athletes who are willing to sell their bodies and their souls for the sake of winning ( " Landis fired after second positive sample , " Sports , Aug. 6 ) . The monetary rewards far outweigh the risks . <p> If it were simply a case of athletics , my concern would not be so great . These people are not decision makers , they are simply athletes . However , cheating in athletics is symptomatic of a greater societal problem . As a society , we receive our signals on what is acceptable from our decision-makers and political leaders . When those people ca n't be trusted to tell us the truth or to conduct themselves ethically , the signal goes out very clearly that " the end justifies the means . " It 's prevalent in our society in all areas . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter who I hurt or what I destroy . " <p> Our young people are watching and listening . <p> RONALD JOHNSON , Austell <p> Hats off to a great musical tradition <p> It was great to see the article by Eileen Drennen on the Everett &; Tanner music ( " Grand ole hideaways keep string music alive , " Page One , Aug. 6 ) . I have been going to Tanner 's Chicken House for several years and have also enjoyed the music at Everett Brothers Music Barn . These venues might be the best places to be on Friday and Saturday nights . The music is terrific , the audience is friendly , and the whole environment is easygoing . <p> There are many places in Georgia where musicians and listeners can have a great time playing and hearing music that does n't blow their ears out or cost too much to attend . I hope the Everetts and Tanners continue for many years and that they continue to get the recognition and front-page coverage they deserve . <p> BILL LONG , Dacula <p> Rivera not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert " exist in a small little place where they count for nothing " ( " Quotes of the week , " @issue , Aug. 6 ) ? <p> The work of Stewart on " The Daily Show " and Colbert on " The Colbert Report " is some of the sharpest political satire our nation has seen since the days of Mark Twain and Will Rogers . <p> As I recall , Rivera 's career has been filled with countless laughable moments too . The difference is , on Comedy Central , the laughs are intentional . <p> TOMMY HOUSWORTH , Decatur <p> United States needs five parties , not two <p> Am I the only voter who wonders if elections still do any good at all ? Have we already lost the right to elect our public officials ? Has our form of government been changed without our consent ? <p> Massive violations of law and the Constitution  --  not to mention simple honesty  --  suggest a post-democratic era has begun . If the Constitution is already in tatters , we may need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is fragmented . We need five parties rather than two , that can form coalitions and arrive at some sort of consensus . One thing to be said in favor of a parliamentary system : It 's likely those running this country would have lost a vote of confidence years ago . <p> ROBERT E. VAN KEUREN JR. , Atlanta
