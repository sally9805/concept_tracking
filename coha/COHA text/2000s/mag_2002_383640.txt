COLLEGE BASKETBALL Headnote Indiana 's coach has the confidence of his players , and it shows in their play , but he is wrestling with the giant that is Bob Knight 's legacy Photograph // The jar sits on a counter in the Indiana Hoosiers training room . It silently beseeches all who pass to be generous with their donations . But that is not getting it done , because as lunchtime passes on this Saturday afternoon , there are but a few lonely coins scattered at the bottom . Mike Davis sees it is time to make a personal appeal . As he calls an end to the shootaround that prepares IU for a game against Penn State , he issues a simple plea for the " Help Pay Coach Davis " Fine " drive . " The more money you put in there , " he says with a grin , " I 'll know you care about me . " This says much about the state of Indiana basketball in the Mike Davis era . It suggests the players are relaxed enough with their coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dear enough he will laugh along and that , at last , the man in this job has a sense of humor others can appreciate . It also testifies to the fact Davis did something foolish enough to receive a $10,000 fine from the Big Ten . He still has much to learn about being a major  --  college head coach . IU is a curious laboratory in which to pursue that education . Thanks largely to Davis ' predecessor , Indiana has more NCAA championships than all but two schools , more NCAA appearances than all but four and more tournament victories than all but five . Meeting this kind of standard is imposing enough . But Indiana following the implosion of Bob Knight 's tenure presented challenges that might have daunted even the most veteran coach . Knight did n't just leave behind a legacy . He left nuclear fallout . Davis has had his own explosive moments . The bursts of honest passion led to his being perceived as " angry man , " which is inaccurate . He is as gentle and approachable as any big-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it eventually manifests itself in his public statements . He frequently has been bitten by his own sound bites . The opening week of the Big Ten season was brutal in that regard . First there was his tirade against game officials after a loss to Butler-and the ensuing fine . That was a good day compared with the news that blared from the Bloomington Herald-Times the morning after the Hoosiers ' league-opening victory over Northwestern : " Davis blasts Knight ! Under subpoena , Davis was deposed by attorneys in a lawsuit filed against Knight by former assistant coach Ron Felling . Davis believed his testimony would remain private , but Indianapolis TV station WTHR won a motion to have it unsealed . Davis was compelled to answer questions about Knight 's comportment and coaching methods . He was asked whether he considered Knight to be a bully . Rather than commit perjury , he said , " yes . " When his answers were revealed , he faced the renewed wrath of Knight zealots . Davis ' answers were considered a breach of loyalty after Knight hired Davis as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , church-going Christian , asked to swear before his God and his country , supposed to respond ? Is he supposed to place the code of the locker room above the law ? " I know I can coach pretty well , " Davis says . " I know I can make adjustments , what it takes to win . It 's just the other stuff . I love coaching here . I really do . But it 's frustrating , the craziness . It 's like somebody 's always trying to get you . " Any time he wants , Davis can get a minimum estimate of the number of Hoosiers who most likely are on his side . Fans still coming to games after all that happened must be invested in IU 's success . As Indiana defeats Penn State in its first Big Ten game at Assembly Hall this season , the crowd is 14,453 . That 's a lot of friends for anyone . But this basketball-crazy state has more than 6 million residents . That 's a lot more potential saboteurs . " The thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of people that it is , " Davis says . " If I knew it was 80-20 , if I knew it was 70-30 , I 'd be fine . But I do n't know . And when you do n't know the percentage of people that support you , it 's in the back of your mind . " It 's like tonight . We 're sitting there down 22-8 , and a normal coach can sit there and say , We 're going to be OK . Just keep coaching : But in my mind ... everything is going through my mind . What if we lose ? " After Knight was fired in September 2000 , some fans felt obliged to choose between their school and their coach . Now that Knight is working again , Davis sees Texas Tech sweatshirts and bumper stickers around Bloomington . And yeah , it bugs him . It seems the circus never plans to leave town . " You 've got 30 years of tradition , you ca n't get rid of it in a year and a half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here . " It 's going to take a long time ... until an Indiana team establishes itself without Bobby Knight . Until a team can do that , people are always going to sit there and remember Coach Knight . " Break from the past In his first 1 1/2 seasons , Davis had nine victories against top 25 teams . Last year 's Hoosiers , which finished 21-13 overall , established a conference record for field-goal defense . Although last year 's team , like this one , did not enjoy a lot of perimeter speed , Davis managed to emphasize the team 's toughness . " We 'll fight you from beginning to end , " Davis says . At the 2001 Final Four , in the lobby of the Minneapolis Hilton , defensive wizard Jerry Tarkanian approached Davis and told him the Hoosiers ' defense was the best defense he had seen . Davis ' decision to adopt a pro-style offense and abandon Knight 's motion game was jarring for fans . But the 2000-01 team won 10 conference games . Knight reached that figure once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be a tough situation no matter who took over , " says Ball State coach Tim Buckley , who twice has lost to Davis . " When we played down there last year in their tournament , I was sitting in the stands watching Indiana and Western Michigan , and I heard , Boy , they just do n't screen like they used to : That job 's different than most . " Davis " coaching won over guard Dane Fife , one of Knight 's most vocal supporters after the firing . A former McDonald 's All-American , Fife averaged 26 points in high school but only 4.4 points in his first three seasons at IU-though he started 67 games . This season , he has more than doubled that average and made 32 3-pointers in his first 16 games , one short of his total for his first three seasons . He helped the Hoosiers to an 11-5 record that included a 4-0 Big Ten start after last Sunday 's win over Iowa . " Coach Davis has really pushed me to shoot the ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence . Coach Davis used to call me Quarter-to-Seven ' when he was an assistant , because I was always good up until the lights would go on . For the first time , I 'm allowing myself to improve at the game . My mind has just been transformed . " Frank to a fault Davis appears to have little trouble coaching , but a good bit of difficulty being a head coach . Many problems have resulted from his dealings with the media , ironic given the hostility that raged between Knight and so many journalists . Photograph // Davis has been open and accommodating . Maybe too open . " I 'm not this guy who 's going to give you political answers , " he says . True enough . After a December game against Ball State , he challenged media analysts who predicted the Hoosiers would lose . That was viewed as disrespect for the Cardinals , who earlier had beaten both Kansas and UCLA . Davis says he only meant his team should be expected to win at home . He declared on his radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the sense of hating a rival , but it was not perceived that way in the Widcats ' locker room . Indiana lost by 14 . " You ca n't say everything you actually think , " says Don Fischer , the Hoosiers ' veteran play-by-play announcer . " I think Mike is still learning what he can and can not do in dealing with the media . He speaks a lot from emotions at times , and then he sits back and thinks , Why did I say that ? ' ' " If there is a place Davis should be able to escape the pressures of coaching the Hoosiers , it is the Bloomington North High gym . His son , Mike Jr. , is a 6-4 small forward for the Cougars good enough to have attracted recruiting interest from-interestingly enough-Ball State . What could be farther removed from the grind of major-college basketball than watching your child play ? This gets complicated , though . Mike Jr . ' s teammate , the star of the state 's No. 1 team , is Sean May . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks as one of the nation 's top 10 prospects . He signed with North Carolina in November . As Bloomington North plays rival Bloomington South , Davis sees this gifted , 6-9 power player on the court and ca n't help but be reminded of what went on in May 's recruitment . But who really knows what happened ? In his deposition for the Felling suit , Davis was asked if he believed Knight attempted to disrupt the IU program since leaving . Davis answered that he had no evidence but that he had been told Knight dissuaded recruits from attending Indiana . The weekend before Sean announced his decision , he and his father took a recruiting visit to Texas Tech-where Knight 's squad is 13-2-on a private plane owned by an IU trustee . " That is the one thing we all have said : That was the poorest choice of timing that could have ever been made , " says Debbie May , Sean 's mother . " It appeared that Coach Knight had some choice in this . " She insists Sean 's decision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She believes Davis was so concerned about Scott May 's connection to Knight it affected the recruitment from the start . " Mike and I have become very , very good friends , " says Debbie May , whose older son , Scottie , is a walk-on redshirt at Indiana . " I was heartbroken at the way our relationship took a turn after the recruiting process . " In North 's overtime win over South , the one thing that is n't surprising is Sean 's heroics , which include scoring half his team 's 66 points . But Mike Jr . has his moment , opening the extra period with a gamebreaking 3-pointer . When it 's over , Debbie May walks across the gym and up the bleachers to greet Mike Davis . They talk for 40 minutes in what amounts to a post-recruitment debriefing . As they part , Sean May 's mother tells the Indiana Hoosiers head coach she loves him like a brother . A small circle Another 75 minutes are left until tipoff of the Penn State game . The walk-through is finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is time for Davis to temporarily retreat into a basketball world where the games are compelling and the problems are n't as looming . It 's as dose as his TV . Davis is n't a coach who ignores every team but his own , every game but the next on his schedule . After he has presented this evening 's game plan to the Hoosiers , he does not want to reconsider any detail . So he 'll sit and watch other teams play . Their coaches do not have to deal with following Knight , and all that involves . Those jobs appear so much less stressful . But there is Matt Doherty , his North Carolina team losing another home game , this one by 22 points . There 's Tom Izzo , with Michigan State limited to eight functional players because of early draft entries , down another two bodies because of injuries and losing on the road . They all have their own crises . Davis could see that if he talked more to other head coaches . He made his way to Indiana by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief stay at Alabama . He has connected himself well to the recruiting network that will produce future Hoosiers talent such as Dallas-area shooting guard Bracey Wright and point guard Marshall Strickland from Maryland . But Davis does not enjoy the same support system of mentors and colleagues as many head coaches . He can trust his assistants : John Treloar , Ben McDonald and former Hoosiers guard Jim Thomas . One of Knight 's first recruits , John Laskowksi , hosts Davis ' TV show and has remained loyal to the program . But none has been a major-college head coach . They help him greatly with the team , which helps explain why that part has gone smoothest . Davis must keep searching to master the rest " But I 'm not going to change toward people , " Davis says . " It 's like in a relationship . I married my wife , and there 's about 20 percent of her that I do n't like . And there 's about 80 percent that I love . I 'm not going to let the 20 percent overshadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been blessed to have this job . Flatout blessed . " Whatever comes my way , I have to stay above it and just focus on coaching . ' That may be the toughest part of the job . Photograph Sidebar " You 've got 30 years of tradition , you ca n't get rid of it in a year and a half .
