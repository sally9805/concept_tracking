. Blink and you 'll miss it : America 's next great ski ghetto hides amidst a city of one million , with Mormon radio on the dial , and at least one set of illegal lawn darts . Salt Lake City , early spring . A Chevy Avalanche heads up a commercial boulevard , past Chili 's , Blockbuster , and the Gap , and reaches a small sign  --  GREEN HILLS DRIVE  --  marking the entrance to a residential neighborhood . The car cruises another couple of blocks , pulls up at a curb , and stops . A compact , muscular guy steps out . He 's not a middle-aged , tucked-in golf shirt , braided belt with the cell-phone holster soccer dad . This guy is young , baby-faced  --  and he 's in flip-flops , a faded logo T-shirt , and a camouflage ball cap . Other young dudes emerge from houses nearby , traipsing across lawns , toting cases of beer . They are n't the insurance brokers , IT wankers , or cubicle jockeys indigenous to this sort of environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ultimate anonymous suburbia are these guys  --  all of them professional skiers . Appearance-wise , Green Hills is exceptionally unexceptional . But two factors distinguish the tiny cul-de-sacs and cheapish 1970s homes from any other American subdivision . It sits at the mouth of Utah 's Little Cottonwood Canyon  --  home to Snowbird , Alta , and some of the lightest snow on earth  --  and is the HQ of photographers , filmmakers , and athletes who have made Little Cottonwood a critical North American ski hub . And , hiding in plain sight amidst suburban blandness , Green Hills is effectively one of the country 's greatest ski towns . If you walked around knocking on doors , in roughly one of four homes you 'd encounter someone who 's been in a Teton Gravity Research or Warren Miller film . Why is Green Hills a skier ghetto ? The obvious location benefit aside , it 's affordable . But the appeal goes deeper . Green Hills offers skiers a sense of community in a sprawling city that is closer in spirit to Los Angeles than Jackson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ski hill , you see them in your neighborhood , " says Fred Foto , who has lived in Green Hills since 1993 " We 're always having dinner together , meeting at each other 's houses , and hitching rides together . " Foto was the first of the current generation of skiers who moved in , and a vital link in the word-of-mouth network that lets skiers know when Green Hills houses come up for sale . Sure enough , Jeremy Nobis owns that Chevy Avalanche , along with a low-slung brown house in the neighborhood . The boys carrying the brew across the lawns ? Sage Cattabriga-Alosa , Julian Carr , and Nick Greener . Some of the revelers currently live in Green Hills , some used to reside here , and others have come just to rage . Today 's celebratory occasion ( as if they needed one ) is Cinco de Mayo , and the Green Hills gang has gathered for a block party . Until recently , Sage Cattabriga-Alosa lived in Green Hills with Chris Minneci and skiing siblings Chris and Matt Collins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key role in developing gap jumps like Chad 's and Pyramid in Grizzly Gulch , up the road from Alta . Now those jumps  --  over roads , pits , or gullies , some with landings on piles of mine tailings  --  are helping attract the next generation of athletes . " Gaps had obviously been done before , but Utah made them famous , " Cattabriga-Alosa says . This jacket is n't doing much for its owner , Richard Duckworth . But it is holding a pint of tequila . Duckworth 's worked at Snowbird for 20 years . Back in July 1988 , he left Glenmills , Pennsylvania , and rented a room less than five miles from here . By Thanksgiving , Duckworth had moved to Snowbird to work as a tram operator . He set up shop in Snowbird 's staff accommodations and , for obvious meteorological reasons , saw little reason to leave . " I do n't go down to Green Hills a lot , " he says , though he 'll soon have to . Snowbird will surround staff quarters with condos this spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Time to check that credit rating . Conventional wisdom would tell you to avoid sticking your head in an alpenhorn . Leaping off of 2,100 vertical feet 's worth of Utah cliffs in one year and front-flipping off of a 210-footer in Switzerland also fall into this category . Julian Carr has survived both . He says Little Cottonwood cultivates big-drop specialists like himself because the dry , light snow is perfect for landings . " The snow just does n't punch back . It 's like a never-ending down blanket , " he says . Carr has lived in Green Hills since April 2006 and was drawn by the concentration of skiers . " There are probably 15 dudes I know within eight blocks of each other . " 10.2 miles from here , at Alta OK , so lawn darts were banned by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , but they 're pretty damn fun . Throwing here , in Nobis 's backyard , is Nick Greener , who won the U.S. Freeskiing Nationals at Snowbird in 2006 With Nick are his brother , Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer ) ; and Chris Collins ( in the orange hat ) . Rick lived in Green Hills as Fred Foto 's roommate from 1996 to 2000 " You always had brothers around the corner , " Rick says . " Whether they were your brother by blood or not , this is a community of people in your same scenario . It 's a good vibe. " 11.7 miles from here , at Alta As the Cinco de Mayo party got louder , somebody started throwing tortillas . That 's when Jamey Parks , a racer turned freeskier , began flinging them back . Parks , like his housemate Nobis , has been featured in several Warren Miller films . Tortilla chucking is probably predictable for a neighborhood whose residents include a strip-club manager who pays her rent in ones , an NFL linebacker turned snowboarder , and the intoxicated skier who led the Park City police on a 20-minute car chase . Exotic residents notwithstanding , Parks says Green Hills is a friendly place where kids play in the street . Jamie Pierre set a world record in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyoming 's Grand Targhee . Pierre learned his trade locally , landing 80-footers inbounds at Alta , 130-footers at Snowbird , and a 165-footer at Wolverine Cirque in the Alta backcountry . He has lived in Utah since 1993 and has seen the state 's popularity skyrocket in the past few years . " Too many of us locals have told our friends how good it is here , " he says . Ski companies are heeding the call too : Rossignol , Dynastar , Salomon , Atomic , Dynamic , and Volant have either moved or are in the process of moving to Utah . Who invited this guy ? Ted Ligety lives in Park City  --  about 30 miles from here . But he probably thinks gate-bashing his way to Olympic gold at Torino entitles him to crash any party he likes . It probably does . It 's also worth noting that , under U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association guidelines , U.S. Ski Team racers are forbidden to drink at team functions . Good thing this is n't a team function . And if it were ? Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lifetime , he 's merely licking his hand because it 's filthy and requires an immediate cleaning . " The houses are stacked tight next to each other , but it 's a quiet neighborhood so you do n't feel like you 're in a city , " says Nobis ( at center with soccer ball ) . Next to him is photographer and entrepreneur Fred Foto , and to the right of Nobis in the dark blue shirt is realtor and resident Jim Williams , who is also part of the network that steers available properties to skiers . The sales pitch : More snow , more girls . The first half is a given , but the latter is interesting . The guy-to-girl ratio in SLC is n't the typical ski-town 12-to-1 absurdity . ( Insert polygamy joke here . ) Housing 's also more affordable . Real estate costs $2,000 per square foot in towns like Vail . In Green Hills , the last house went for $135 per square foot . " I do n't see many people moving from Salt Lake to other ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole lot of people from other towns moving here .
