THERE WAS WAVERING WHITE FIRE over Cochise County , one of those sapping early September days when the sky was light cobalt and cloudless . Since dawn any breeze that had crossed the nearby puny , snuff-colored mountains was filled with high fever . Billy Bonney sat bootless on the boardwalk planks in sweating misery outside Little Sally 's Saloon , warm , half-gone Mex beer by his side , fanning himself in the shade with a stained , dusty hat , thinking that McLean had to be the worst , poorest town of all . Sometime or another , the wind would hide it with dunes . It had died in 1876 , when the tin mine quit , but had n't decently buried itself yet , five years later . He thought he maybe should have stayed in Douglas or gone on to Tucson . Yet one did n't offer much more than the other . They were both miserable towns . He made his swollen feet comfortable , extending them to the full angle of the shade . For the last few minutes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , going back to work for the Cudahys , the meat people from Chicago , shooting down rustlers on the Durango spread . He 'd done that and it was like target practice . The rustlers never had a chance . Aside from the money , there was n't much appealing about working for the Cudahys . He pushed the thought away for the time being . Just now , nobody with any common sense was ambling about in McLean . Not even lizards . Yet he heard a voice : " Move yo ' laigs , cowboy . " The Texas-flavored drawl carried distinctly over the lifeless midafternoon murmur that trickled out of Little Sally 's . It was too oven stifling to even laugh at the gruff orders . But Billy looked up with interest . There were three of them , trailflushed and alkali dusty . One was a squat man with a square face that reminded Billy of a large cube of whiskered bedrock . About fifty , Billy guessed . He looked as tough as oak heart . Another , looking midtwenties , was big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young one , also burly and fatty . Maybe nineteen . They all looked a bit alike . They 'd come out of nowhere . " I said , ' Move yo ' laigs . ' " That was the youngest one talking so emphatically . Billy frowned up at him , not quite believing any right-minded human would come on that strong in this heat . The speaker had loose lips , a beetle brow , and the damnedest bullet necklace that Billy had ever seen . The bullets were pierced through with baling wire . A silly decoration , Billy thought . The speaker looked remarkably like some boy lumberjack , but he was dressed more like a trail rider . Billy cocked his head and said , with rapt amusement , " Step around ' em , boy . Plenty o ' room . I 'm jus ' too tuckered to accommodate . " Billy watched as the fatty fellow frowned at his partners , then seemed to make up his mind . It was fascinating to watch those dumb gray eyes operate . The boy aimed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit him just below the rump , in thigh flesh . It was a big slabby toe that would hurt . Billy 's back parted from the adobe wall and he came up in one smooth move , a .44 suddenly in his hand . The gun thudded and the felt crown jumped from the boy 's tall black hat before the intruder could get anywhere near his own hip holster . He froze in panic . Billy fanned another shot near the formerly threatening toe , sending splinters of wood ; then he turned his attention to the others , ready to shoot again . The visitors stood openmouthed and amazed . What had been lazing against the wall-an ordinary , no-good , shiftless , scruffy young cowhand-was now erect and tense , cold-eyed , lips tight against teeth . Thin smoke spiraling from his barrel , he was ready for a third shot . Suddenly full of fury , three days of yellow beard on his rigid jaws , he appeared ready to clear the town . He looked older than he was . Actually , he 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the booms echoed along the near-empty shimmering street . A dog barked up the way , awakened by the bursts . Then a horse whinnied in fear before McLean fell back to silence . Billy , feeling like he wanted to kill-maybe it was the heat-heard a female voice behind him . It asked caustically , " Who the hell 's shootin ' ? " He did n't turn , just kept the .44 on the boy , breathing hard . Sally sighed , " Cowboy , go across the street if you 're gon na do that . " The squat older man , quizzical more than frightened , answered her slowly , " Why , I bet this feller a five he could n't put a hole in my son 's hat . He did it , by grannies . Burn your scalp , Joe ? " Still stunned , Joe shook his head . In contrast to the others , the sweating gray-eyed , gray-haired older man was dressed like he might be a traveling merchant . His alpaca black suit coat fit his stocky body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess it 's too steamin ' hot for lil ' jokes , eh ? " Billy relaxed , holstering the gun . He felt adrenaline start filtering back into its proper places and broke a friendly smile on his face . When it was n't tensed , it was a pleasant , appealing face . Even the stubble could n't hide that . He was of medium height and build , body hard as river rocks , hair curly blond . " It 's hot , all right . Been like a furnace here two days . " Billy glanced again at Joe . There were white streaks angling toward Joe 's mouth . His nostrils had flared . He was an ugly something , and ugly somethings rarely lived long here in the West . Billy said quietly , " This weather 'll turn a rabbit stark mad . " He took an almost unnoticeable breath , relaxing even more , but he remained wary , his hands barely inches from his holster . The older man 's practiced eyes took account of those hands . " Name is Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of us is Smith . I 'm daddy to these boys . This is Joe , my youngest . Joe , you ' pologize . You disturbed a restin ' stranger . " Joe mumbled an apology , his cheeks now crimson with a mixture of embarrassment and rage . " This is Perry , my oldest . " Billy nodded . Both were two hundred-pounders if an ounce . Shaggy , sandy hair grew down their napes and puffed at the vees of their shirts . Their dusty black pants were tucked into brown boot tops . Texans , he was sure . " Billy Bonney . " The squat man grinned back , nodding at the dead beer . " Billy , how ' bout me gittin ' you a fresh'un , an ' we 'll join out here where it 's cool . " There was n't a cool square inch in all of Arizona . " Mr. Smith , all the- " " Art , " he said disarmingly . " We deal in cattle . Buy ranches and so forth . " " Art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cool . I rode up from Douglas two days ago an ' like to died . Walked the last ten miles . My horse is still parched an ' my feet is blowed . " Art nodded back . " We come up this mornin ' from Tombstone . I am ever parched . " He went on into Little Sally 's . Gunplay over , Billy eased down to the boardwalk again , his heart flattening out . Putting his shoulders against the eroding clay wall , he wondered about the trio . That Joe had sure pushed his luck . Tampering with a total stranger in a 110 degrees was like stroking rattlesnakes at high noon . Tampering with one who 'd been in a bad mood for months invited maiming . He filled his lungs with the hot air and made a guess their name was n't Smith . Art 's sons stayed uncomfortably on their feet , keeping silent , acting restless . They looked around as if McLean had something of interest to see . Then Joe spit into the street dust . Billy held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the livery . Billy followed the look and saw three glistening horses . They 'd traveled hard . They looked like good mounts . The big gelding , in particular . Billy knew horses . These were not cowpoke mounts . And the " Smiths " did n't look like cattle dealers . Perry said , " Joe , go tell that liveryman to git those horses out o ' the sun right now . Tell him I said so . You heard Pa say we 'd stay tonight . " Joe sent another juvenile glob of spit into the yellow-white dust , hitched his belt , and turned abruptly , glaring at Billy . " I 'm gon na kill yo ' ass , " he said , then slouched off across the street . Billy shook his head . " My , Joe has a fatal attitude . " Perry stared at Billy . " He 's fast . You took him by surprise . " Billy grinned . " That 's the only way . " Then Art came out . He settled intimately by Billy and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Billy blinked as Art took a long gulp of fresh milk and wiped his mouth . " Ah , that is some kinda good . I had some gypsum wattah this mornin ' and still taste it . " " Gypsum 's a bad taste , " Billy agreed , and fell silent . Milk ? He did n't know that Little Sally had it in her cooler . Billy was normally talkative , but he had n't been himself for quite a while . He felt an even greater strain at the moment . Behind the generosity of his host , he thought he saw a brutality that was more open in his sons . There was something cruel , nearly hidden , in Art 's face . " I had to be impressed by that shootin ' , " Art said . " I declare it was the fastest I 've seen in years . That your line o ' work ? " " Well , I stay in practice , Art . Never know when someone 's gon na come up an ' make rude demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , is n't he ? Real frisky . " " Yeh . " Billy pulled out a small cloth bag of Greensboro and started making a cigarette . " He is reckless sometimes . But a good boy . I 'm gon na talk to him tonight . " Art took another long gulp of the white stuff . " The way you handled that gun-um-huh ! Almost professional . Not many men ' round like that now .
