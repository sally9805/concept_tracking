West Coast Highway A Comparison of Dan Dickau 's senior-year stats ( through Sunday ) with those of two former West Coast Conference guards who went on to become NBA All-Stars shows that he deserves at least a long look at the next level . // PLAYER // SEASON // PTS // ASTS // REBS // FG% // 3-PT% // FT% // John Stockton // 1983-84 // 20.9 // 7.2 // 2.4 // 57.7 // N/A* // 69.2 // Steve Nash // 1995-96 // 17.0 // 6.0 // 3.6 // 43.1 // 34.4 // 89.4 // Dan Dickau // 2001-02 // 20.9 // 5.0 // 3.1 // 45.5 // 48.0 // 88.6 // *Three-point shot not introduced until 1986-87 // The song is the clincher . It 's not enough that point guard Dan Dickau has shepherded No. 7 Gonzaga , a genuine Final Four contender , to its loftiest ranking in school history , or that he 's engaged to a blindingly gorgeous Portland Trail Blazers dancer , or that he 's almost sure to be the first Bulldog since John Stockton to make it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certifiable Northwest cultural phenomenon  --  joining Gore-Tex , Copper River salmon and grunge ( R.I.P. )  --  with the release of a tribute CD single , sung to the tune of the Commodores ' 1977 hit , Brick House : // He 's Dan Dick ... OWWW // He 's mighty mighty , just lettin ' it all hang out . // He 's Dan Dick ... OWWW // He 's lightnin ' fast , and that 's a fact , ai n't holdin ' nothin ' back .... // Truth be told , Brick House is about the last phrase you 'd use to describe Dickau , a 6-foot , 189-pound , baby-faced sharpshooter . At week 's end Dickau was shooting a remarkable 48.0% from three-point range and averaging 20.9 points and 5.0 assists , while proving that college senior and NBA prospect can exist in the same sentence . " The way he 's shooting it , and with the decisions he 's making , Dan is playing as well as anyone in the country , " Gonzaga coach Mark Few said last Saturday after Dickau 's 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepperdine , raising their record to an impressive 24-3. // If Gonzaga finally shed the Cinderella tag last year by going to its third straight Sweet 16  --  Duke and Michigan State are the only other schools to have done that over the same span  --  then this year 's deeper , beefier Bulldogs could go even further . Unlike Gonzaga 's last three bracket-busters , which were never seeded higher than 10th , this year 's edition should be seeded much higher , and suddenly the denizens of Jack and Dan 's , the Spokane tavern run by Stockton 's father , Jack , are asking the unthinkable : Can this team win it all ? " I think we can , " says Dickau . " To win a national championship you need a little luck , but if we continue improving , anything 's possible with this team . " // With his preternatural court vision and cojones and his hair-trigger release , Dickau is poised to cross a personal threshold as well . For all of Gonzaga 's tournament success , none of its recent stars  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Stockton 's path to the NBA . According to one Western Conference scout , Dickau could go as high as the middle of the first round . " He 's an NBA player , " the scout says . " He has so much focus , he 's a proven winner and he makes shots . He 's as valuable to Gonzaga as Jason Williams is to Duke . If he gets the right fit , he 'll do pretty damn well . " // Former Michigan State coach Jud Heath-cote , a Gonzaga season-ticket holder , says Dickau reminds him of former Spartans guard Scott Skiles , who played for 10 years in the NBA . Adds Few , " If you want to win games at the next level , you 'd better take Dan . If you 're interested in technicals and tattoos , then do n't take Dan . That 's not what he 's about . " // Dickau 's fascination with Stockton runs from basketball cards ( as a kid , he collected more than 300 cardboard Stocktons ) to uniform numbers ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two seasons at Washington before transferring to Gonzaga , where he flipped the numerals to 21 ) to a work ethic that emulates Stockton 's fanatical dedication . When Stockton made his annual pilgrimage to Gonzaga last summer , Dickau cut short his month-long ban from the gym ( handed down by Few after Dickau 's trip to China for the World University Games ) to train with one of his idols . " In the mornings I 'd work with him on shooting , and in the afternoons he 'd play pickup games with us , " Dickau says . " He 's one of the top 50 players in NBA history , but his work ethic is still incredible  --  and when he gets in a game , he wants to win . " // That said , Dickau has more in common with another West Coast Conference product , Dallas Mavericks guard and Santa Clara alum Steve Nash . Both are shoot-first point guards and have bird's-nest hairstyles , to say nothing of cult followings ( high school girls tend to squeal in their presence ) and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter have included former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and actress Elizabeth Hurley . For Dickau it 's fianc ? e Heather Nevenner , his high school sweetheart from Vancouver , Wash. , who 's a third-year member of the Blazers ' dance team . // Although Dickau 's teammates and coaches give him endless grief ( " Hey , Dan , Shawn Kemp called , " Few will crack . " He had some news for you " ) , it 's fair to say you wo n't be seeing this couple in the tabloids . Seven years after they began dating at Vancouver 's Prairie High , Dan led Heather into a candlelit room over Christmas break and had her put together a puzzle of a photograph . When she was done , Dickau pulled out the last piece  --  in which he was holding an engagement ring  --  and bowed on one knee to pop the question . " I was in shock , " says Nevenner , a former high school hoopster herself who still remembers Dan 's first pickup line : " Are n't you number 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal had a dual purpose , Dickau points out . " In high school she won a state championship and I did n't , so I had to buy her an engagement ring to keep from looking at her state ring , " he says , laughing . Their wedding , a real-life sequel to Love and Basketball , is set for Aug. 3. // He knows he 's got everything That an All-American needs . How could he lose with coach Mark Few ? He can dish , he can score , you can see he 's got a winnin ' hand . He 's Dan Dick ... OWWW .... // In an age when high school juniors consider turning pro , Dickau is an anachronism , a guy who credits his success to patience , fortitude and experience . Take the eighth grade . Dickau did  --  twice . Despite a healthy academic record , Dickau was young for his grade and a spindly 5 ' 5 " at the time , so he and his parents , Randy and Judy , decided to pull him out of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian School , run by a nondenominational Christian church in Vancouver . " I saw it as another year to play basketball , " Dickau says . " Plus , I had always called myself a Christian , but I did n't know what that meant . That was the year I made a full decision on how to live my life . " // In other words , it was a redshirt year , not unlike the one Dickau was forced to take upon transferring to Gonzaga , a Jesuit school , three years ago . He says he never felt comfortable during his two years at Washington , a signing decision that he says was based on his false assumption that bigger ( Pac-10 ) always meant better . " The development just was n't there , " says Randy , who coached Dan through the eighth grade and who still travels with Judy from Vancouver for almost all of Dan 's games . " All his friends were getting better , and Dan was saying , ' Why not me ? ' " // " Something my dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was averaging only 4.6 points a game when he broke his left heel midway through his sophomore season . " He said , ' I do n't care if you transfer , but if you stay , have a nice career . ' I thought maybe he 'd just watch my games on TV if I did n't transfer . I wanted to be at a place where everybody put the team first and cared about each other . The day I decided to transfer , I felt like I had a new lease on my career . " // Gonzaga provided everything Washington did n't : a gym he could use almost around-the-clock , smaller classes and a genial , slower-paced atmosphere that reminded him of his tight-knit high school . The basketball was good , too . So he waited . He improved . When he finally took the court again last year after a season and a half on the sideline , he thrived , averaging 18.9 points a game . " Dan has found freedom within the structure , " says center Zach Gourde . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a bunch of athletes running and jumping . Dan is n't the most gifted individual athletically , but he overcomes that by working harder and thinking better than guys he plays against . " // Guess what ? Patience does pay off . Dickau may be an old man at 23 , but as he says , " I 've always been that kid in the third grade who said he wanted to be an NBA player when he grows up , and then all the kids laugh . God gave me an opportunity by allowing me to transfer here , and things could n't have turned out any better . " // Dickau 's faith is no act . For the past two seasons he has organized a Monday-night Bible study group at the home of Shann Ferch , a Gonzaga professor who played at Pepperdine in the late ' 80s . The meetings are a mix of male bonding , gospel songs and earnest discussion about the role of religion in society . " We 'll sit and talk about life , and try to refocus our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week 's meeting each member wrote an original psalm . " Dan 's solid in what he believes , " says Ferch , who has put aside his Pepperdine loyalties and become a Gonzaga fan , " but he does a good job of living it without invading other people 's lives . " // Nor is Dickau above hosting a regular game of penny-ante poker among friends on the new baize card table Nevenner gave him for Christmas . " I used to play with those guys , " says sophomore forward Cory Violette , Dickau 's road roommate , " until I figured out Dan deals from the bottom of the deck . " Dickau takes the Fifth on that charge , but there 's no denying that he likes to win . One of Nevenner 's favorite stories is about the time two years ago when she and Dan played Monopoly until three in the morning at her parents ' house . She says Dickau 's reaction when he landed on her Park Place property  --  with a hotel  --  and went bankrupt was priceless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " and he had little tears in his eyes . He was so upset , I could n't stop laughing . " // If Dickau was intense that night , try to imagine the scene last Saturday in his final home game at the Kennel in Spokane . In a kaleidoscope of emotions ( and bodily fluids ) , Dickau cried during his senior farewell , bled from a second-half blow to his mouth and still rang up 26 points , seven assists and five rebounds to help move the Bulldogs into a first-place tie with Pepperdine in the West Coast Conference . In the locker room afterward his face was literally covered in blood , sweat and tears . For a moment , it was impossible not to think back to the passage Dickau had highlighted in his dog-eared Bible two years ago , the one he can show you within seconds of being asked to name his favorite verse . " The end of a thing is better than its beginning , " reads Ecclesiastes 7:8 . " And the patient in spirit is better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must have known a thing or two about college basketball . // This article contains a table .
