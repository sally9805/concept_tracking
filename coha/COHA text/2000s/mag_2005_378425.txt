Walk on the moon , and people want a piece of you . It can get to a guy . For Apollo 11 commander NEIL ARMSTRONG , the fiber that finished him was hair . An Ohio barber sold clippings of Armstrong 's hair for $3,000 to a middleman , who got them to a Connecticut collector of curls from Abraham Lincoln , Charles Dickens , Marilyn Monroe and others . When news got back to Armstrong , he had his lawyer shoot a letter to the barber demanding the return of his hair or a $3,000 donation to charity . But the barber had already spent the cash , and the collector refused to hand over the goods , though last week he offered to make the $3,000 charitable donation . No word yet on whether that makes the cut .
