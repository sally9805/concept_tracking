I think at last I will give up the Blacksmith House . I 've liked the place since college , when my best friend , Celia , and I would meet for coffee in those frugal , scrubbed pine rooms , full of the feel of long-dead Puritans , which we were not . You could smoke in public in those days , and we sucked unfiltered Pall Malls , the most kick for the buck , making sure that there was paint on us somewhere . Celia was beautiful , part Indian , part imp , with Coke-bottle green eyes and skin that somehow let you know it was n't white , though it was nougat-pale , creamy . Her father and older brothers fished in Maine , and she liked to wear ripped jeans , flannel shirts , and stroll along beside the tweedy Harvard crowd with languid grace . <p> Underneath , hidden to everyone but me , she had a conscience worthy of Aquinas , and a deep God streak . She wanted to discuss the moral implications of our every act . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your money to the poor ? Was a portrait of a dying homeless person just sensation for itself ? For years we wondered what she could do with a certain married professor that would be morally correct , yet satisfy her raging need to get into his pants . <p> " He tucked the label in my shirt , " she said one day , upstairs in the Blacksmith House . " I felt his fingers on my neck . He went on staring at my canvas like it was nothing . I think he has some casuistical system worked out , wherein he can do anything so long as his motives are pure . He pretended to be calm and said something about Gauguin . ' What was his crime against perspective ? ' as if I might do it , too . As if his mission were to prevent me . " <p> " What did you do ? " <p> " I did n't know what to do . Do I have to say something , to keep from being wrong ? Like Keep your mitts off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to lie , to keep from tempting him ? " <p> " Yes , you do , " I said and gave her a hard look . It was one of our big subjects  --  lying from kindness , to protect someone , lies of omission . When did they become the same as any other lie ? <p> She took the cigarette out of my hand and sucked on it . " But you never lie , do you ? And you know it . Would you tell him you wanted him , and therefore he should keep his mitts off you ? " <p> I reached across the table , pushed a silky lock out of her eyes . We touched each other all the time in public , made a point of it . We held hands , or stood with one arm draped around the other 's neck . I was what some people would call a tall cool blonde , and we must have been a sight , Celia soft and dark , me all bones , entwined . Not even lesbians did that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had a parade of men and boys , a new one every two months . Celia was not a virgin , but she wanted to get married , have a baby sometime soon . I wanted that life , too . It 's just that our approaches were a little different . <p> " You ca n't tell him unless you want to seduce him . Because you know it would . He 'd go insane . " I had seduced a married professor myself , the year before , as Celia well knew . <p> Her laugh was soundless , like a bellows puffing in and out . <p> " Knowing I felt the same ? But I keep thinking-what if he 'd be happier with me ? His marriage is hollow . He never sleeps . He reads all night . He drives me home three nights a week . " <p> I nodded . Celia lived about three blocks from him , in a house with other students . <p> " And that 's fine . So long as you never do a thing you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was our principle , the one that stood to every test . <p> She closed her eyes . " Oh , God . Of course I ca n't . The guilt is even too much now . " <p> She leaned forward , searched my eyes . <p> " You know what I wish ? I wish we could be Catholics . They know exactly what a sin is and how to get absolved . Protestants have to obey the spirit of the law , and that 's endless , because it 's vague . And no one hears your confession . You carry the same sin year after year , and never get absolved . ' We are forgiven , ' says some minister who has n't heard your sin , and what is that supposed to do ? It has n't been removed . Not like when a priest has heard the whole earful , and he frees you from it . Go in peace and sin no more . Then it is truly gone . " <p> I held my hand over her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " <p> She caught my hand and gazed into my eyes . " You laugh , but you know it helps , even if it 's you . Do you really think I am absolved ? " <p> " No one was ever more innocent than you . " <p> " That 's now . " She laughed her soundless laugh . " How will I ever keep from telling him ? " <p> I grinned . " Just stare at that little bald spot on his head and think about Gauguin . " <p> Celia stopped riding home with him . We graduated , wondered what to do . We both wanted to paint , but how were you supposed to eat ? <p> There was art history , and we got fellowships to read a million books while grading freshman essays on the Post-Impressionists . We spent more years on Levi-Strauss and Baudrillard and Lyotard than anyone who 'd ever held a brush . We took the same classes , and dominated them . Celia hated abstract art , except Rothko and Franz Marc , in whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " numina " and " grace " with a straight face , while I tried out the tougher faiths of Marxism and cultural historicism . <p> " Art is hoax , " I said , " and surplus capital , effluvia of luxury . Art is imperial aggression , very thinly veiled . The sun never sets on Jackson Pollock 's empire anywhere . " <p> Then I retired with Celia to the Blacksmith House , to discuss the hierarchical behavior everywhere in academe , and how there was no way to escape judging constantly . We wondered if we could foster our students without hurting them , and read each other 's seminar papers before we turned them in . We talked an hour on the phone at night , even if we 'd met that day . We wore each other 's clothes . <p> " We need another year , " she said one afternoon . " For this friendship to jell . " <p> " To jell ? " I said , a little hurt she could think so . How much more jelled could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had . <p> " I mean , for it to become strong and flexible , the reed that bends in gale-force wind . So even if one of us had to commit murder , we 'd defend each other automatically . Three musketeers . " <p> I picked a tobacco flake off my tongue . " You planning to murder someone soon ? " <p> Her green eyes shone . She laughed her puffy gasps . " You never know . " <p> Our second year in grad school , Celia met a future minister named Daniel , moved in with him , and took two incompletes . Her back hurt , she said , from so much reading , and she could n't paint . She carried a pillow into class , and went to chiropractors instead of to the library . <p> " Paint gives me hives , " she said . She went to herbalists , who made her give up cigarettes and coffee . She quit going to class . One day I saw her disappear into the big brick church on Harvard Square . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told me when I asked . <p> " Okay . But what will you do now ? " As far as I could tell , she was n't doing anything . <p> I was too busy to pay attention for a while . I finished coursework , studied for my doctoral exams . I had to memorize the history of Western art and every theory about it . For a year , I hardly slept . I read . I smoked three packs a day , and knew what time it was by counting butts . <p> People fainted in the course of their exams and threw up in trash cans . The written part was sixteen hours long , plus three oral , two more when the art department challenged every word . By the time I finished , I knew nothing about anything , and staggered out to Celia in the hall . She waited with me while the art department debated my fate inside . Finally , the tall , gray-haired chairman came out from behind the beveled glass . <p> " It was a pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " he said mournfully . <p> Celia gripped my arm and led me out of there . She took me home to the apartment she now shared with Daniel , a decent place in an old house in Somerville . Daniel was extremely thin , with deep lines in his face , though he was only twenty-five , like us , with a blond shock of surfy hair . He gave a wry smirk as he held a champagne glass toward me . I reached for it , began to sob . <p> " It was too hard . " <p> Celia crouched beside me , pressed her cheek to mine . " I know , " she said . <p> And it was true . She did . <p> That summer , Celia married Daniel at her parents ' seaside church , and stopped taking my calls . Daniel answered every time . <p> " She is n't here , " he 'd say . Or , " She 's resting now . " <p> " Resting ? " I said . " Resting ? " <p> Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside their room ? Even prisoners got one phone call . I phoned every day for weeks , but she did not call me . <p> " Hey , Daniel . Tell Celia I 'm not calling back again . She 'll have to get in touch with me . " <p> " Okay , " he said . But when my phone rang , it was never Celia . <p> A year later , I caught a glimpse of her in the chilly reaches of the Harvard swimming pool . She was hugely pregnant in a green tank suit stretched tight , and I watched her underwater do a dreamy breaststroke back and forth . In the locker room , we both stood at the mirror , several women in between , while she drew a faint brown line beneath her eyes and smudged it with a fingertip . I 'm sure she saw me in the frame of her vision . But she did not turn her head . <p> I supposed it was the saga of my life , the way the boyfriends came and went , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wedding ring . I could almost understand . <p> But when I knew that Celia was gone for good , I was more crushed than I had ever been by any man . You expected that from lovers , but not from your best friend . I caught the flu , kept smoking , and it turned into pneumonia . I spent a month in bed , unable to catch my breath . I was n't sure I wanted to . I wanted to find a deep woods , crawl inside a big black garbage sack , and put a gun inside my mouth . I wanted to dispose of my remains and never be identified . I had no messages to send to anyone . <p> Instead , I found a psychiatrist who took me on for charity at half the going rate , and spent a year weeping for Celia in his red wingchair . Dr. Douhomet was hairless as a frog , and hardly said a word , except " Time 's up " and " Thirty-five dollars , please . " Once , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , he gave a small , superior smile . <p> " It was erotic , but not genital , " he said and nodded with a click . <p> I shook my head . " It was n't erotic . It was playful , and about defying categories . It was n't easy to freak out the art department , but we tried . We wanted to show them even straight girls could do that . That there were more things in heaven and on earth than were dreamt of in their philosophy , Horatio . Or in your philosophy , " I said with sudden energy . <p> He went on beaming his Olympian grin , and did n't say a word . <p> One afternoon I saw him drive his BMW convertible through Harvard Square , and I lit up like the preteen fan of some rock star . I ran a block to try to catch him at the light on Church , and when his car was gone , I laughed and laughed . So that was transference  --  and if I felt that way about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very strange experience . I supposed he wanted me to transfer onto him and somehow feel what I had felt for Celia , and cure myself by understanding it . <p> But the feeling I had on the street was nothing I had ever felt for Celia . I loved Celia , but I would not have chased her up the block . Sex was what gave you that crazy energy , and I had done stranger things for men I hardly knew . And after I had slept with them , I felt related to them , forever and ever , amen . It must be because my genes got mixed up in it , trying to fulfill their evolutionary destiny . <p> But I did n't feel that way for Celia . Evolution was n't interested in friendship , and that gave it a democratic feel . Friends loved each other voluntarily , no matter how close they got . And that meant Dr. Douhomet had nothing he could do for me . <p> " I 'm not coming back , " I said the next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " But you 're finally getting somewhere ! " he shouted . It was the first time he 'd expressed emotion , while I 'd been weeping for a year . <p> " That 's okay . I feel much better anyway . " <p> And it was true , when I walked out of his office , it cheered me up . I did n't need a shrink . I needed a friend to talk things over with , share the details of my life . <p> But I was wary , and I had a dissertation now to write , on the New York School . It took me five more years , and I was over thirty , so lonely I thought I might implode , before I had the heart to find another friend . <p> It was the week I broke up with my sweetest lover ever , a handsome pipe welder who sculpted on the side . Ricky had made me an eight-pound valentine of inch-thick sheet metal , with a small arrow he had somehow made to pierce right through . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made love like that , too . But he had gotten a vasectomy at twenty-three , and he was never going to marry me . <p> " You 're never going to marry me , are you ? " I said , one night on the phone . <p> " No , " said Ricky in a voice of mild surprise . " Did I ever say I would ? " <p> He had n't , that was it . Now what was I supposed to do ? <p> I needed someone I could tell it to . I thought of Katie , who was art director of a Boston magazine . Katie was thirty-eight , and lovely , confident , good at what she did . We had met socially , and she took pity on my student poverty , gave me castoff clothes . They were the best things I had ever owned , a wool Ralph Lauren skirt , a hand-knit harlequin sweater , fawn-brown Gucci loafers light as glove leather . For the shoes alone , I ought to call Katie . <p> We made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't smoked since the pneumonia , and half of Cambridge had quit , too . Most restaurants around the square ignored the trend , went on as smoky dives where you could swill martinis , chew on fat and gristle in the dark . Only the Blacksmith had clean air , mesculin salads , homemade soup  --  which meant it would be packed with parents , kids in strollers , diaper bags . So I put on the Guccis early , dodged the icebergs crossing Harvard Yard , as snow began to swirl . <p> The tall , lean windows of the Blacksmith steamed , as frostbit people packed inside . Puffed coats stood eight-deep to the counter , babies squalled . I tried to wiggle into line . But someone dropped a bowl of lentil soup down the staircase , and the crowd recoiled , slipping on the oak floor . <p> I waited half an hour , and was almost to the register when Katie wedged inside . She looked about nineteen in a hooded car coat , tall suede boots , hair sprung out around her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with weights , got massages , facials , manicures . She had her pores vacuumed , hair lightened with special weaves . Unwinding her long scarf , she cried out in a cheerful voice , inches from a woman trying to pull a toddler out of its snowsuit . <p> " Sorry ! The gynecologist ran late . I asked him to check out the bacteria in there , you know , take a smear and look under the microscope . And he said , ' Whew ! Have you got bacteria in there ! ' " <p> Katie was from Manhattan , and I 'd noticed that New Yorkers could say anything in crowded restaurants , sure they 'd never see the same people again . But Cambridge was about the size of an Upper West Side block , and I cringed as she shouted on . <p> " And I have this thing on my shoulder , this little nothing red spot . I showed it to him , hoping he would say it 's definitely not herpes , and I should forget it right away . Know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herpes to me ! ' " <p> Mortified , I stared into the deli case . What did I care what these people thought ? I did , though . I cared . Holding up one foot , I pointed to the Gucci loafer , trying to distract her . <p> Katie smiled and nodded , shouted on . " He said it can be years in incubation , so there 's just no way to tell who gave it to me . It could be some guy ten years back , who did n't know he had it . He may just be getting symptoms now , and wham , it 's got me , too . The doctor says I should n't bother notifying guys I 've slept with in the last few years , since they 'll find out soon enough . Oh , lentil soup , how perfect , do n't you think ? " <p> The girl behind the counter had six rings through her upper lip , and she lifted it as if she had n't realized women our age still had sex . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , when they fixed their hair or shopped for clothes . Why do they bother ? I had wondered then . Who 's going to look at them ? <p> " Two lentil soups , " I said . I turned to Katie loyally . " I bet you 're going to be fine . " <p> She seemed to strain to hit a high note that went through walls . " No way . He said there 's herpes now in half the single population . But even married people are n't quite safe , are they ? Think of Bob 's poor wife . You know , that guy I slept with last year ? She 's probably got herpes , too ! " <p> The girl behind the counter slopped our soups in haste . Hoisting the tray , I turned to fight my way into the crowd . But it parted like the Red Sea , averted eyes on every side . <p> Upstairs , no one knew how dangerous we were . All the babies had been crowded into two small rooms , like steerage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table lay buried in coats , children squirming all around . We worked our way in , settled down beside a young blond woman with her sweater pulled up , one pink breast exposed . She looked like a Swedish grad student , and her tiny red-faced infant suckled audibly , so close I could smell milk . <p> I smiled at Katie , rolled my eyes . Of course we 'd have to talk on neutral subjects here . Katie knew a lot about the art scene , and she had explained to me the process of full-color printing and the problem with the greens . Shaking out my paper napkin , I held my spoon above the soup . <p> " So , did you see that thing on Caravaggio , in Art in America ? " <p> She brightened with delight . " By that dick Howard James ? Oh , sure , you know who he is . He did those burning scarecrows under glass . ' American Gothic . ' You know , you saw that . I knew him in SoHo , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dick . He had this huge one that he thought you were supposed to die for . He thought it was about pumping , you know ? Pumping ! Half an hour , in-out , in-out , in-out , on and on and on ! " <p> Crowd noise ceased , and Katie could be heard in the next room at least . <p> " Does that do anything for you ? You know , pumping ? " <p> I took a slurp of soup and gestured to my full mouth . She leaned forward , yelled . <p> " What 's that you 're mumbling ? I bet it 's no . It does n't do a thing for me , either . Oral sex is what I like . Licking , I mean . But most guys only seem to like it for themselves . It 's been an age since I found anyone who 'd give me cunnilingus , more than two minutes anyway . Have you ? Do you have trouble finding men willing to lick you properly ? " <p> She waited for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor . A pierced and tattooed , gender-non-specific busperson paused with a tray nearby , pretended to scan the room . <p> " Let 's not talk about it here , " I whispered . <p> " What ? " She gaped at me . " Not talk about it here ? Why ever not ? " <p> I was miserable for days . I was not cut out for friendship , that was clear . Why could n't I have talked to Katie and forgotten all those people listening ? I was raised to be inhibited , by unhappy Protestants . Why could n't I have shouted pump ! lick ! herpes ! , told a few tales of my own ? Maybe then I 'd have a friend . <p> But I did n't have one , and now I was even more alone . I missed Ricky terribly . I 'd been invited to an opening in the Back Bay , and he might be there . I knew I should n't go , but I put on his favorite dress , a knitted cream silk sheath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforgettable . Wrapped in my somewhat shabby overcoat , I took the T to Arlington and wobbled through the slushy streets . <p> I had almost reached the gallery when a cab pulled up in front and Ricky bounded out . He looked devastating , wide shoulders in a tweed jacket , curls on his strong brown neck . He turned back toward the cab , and Katie stepped out in a tight black dress and heels . Her ankles looked extremely good . Laughing , he put an arm around her , and they disappeared into the gallery . <p> My toes froze as I stood , and certain memories came back to me . <p> " You and Katie , what a team , " he 'd said , the night I introduced them , warm brown eyes gleaming . Once I went up to Vermont to see my family , and when I got back , neither of them told me they had met . Then Katie had a party , and I took Ricky . It was a November night , cold in her living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddled with the radiator valve . <p> " Ricky ! " she cried . " This thing does n't work . You 're the only one who ever made it put out any heat . What did you do ? " <p> Ricky blanched , and so did I. He rushed in , and the two of them fussed with the valve , animated as if onstage . They shouted about a painting on the wall , which someone had given Katie . Ricky thought that it was bad . <p> " Really bad ! " he cried . " Wretched ! " <p> " Oh , not that bad ! " she yelled . <p> " No , really bad ! " <p> They laughed frantically . Now all I could think of was how Ricky 's favorite brand of sex did not involve pumping . <p> I had a friend once , loyal and true . I was five , in a mill town , and Sue Ellen 's family lived next door to mine . Two years older than I was , she still stuck with me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick front stoop , about the strange things people did , and where pets went when they were dead , until she graduated into junior high and started to wear nylons and French heels , and smelled like Campbell 's soup when it was warm . Then my father lost his job , and we had to move to my grandparents ' farm . I never saw her after that , though we wrote for a few years , on the perfumed stationery our brothers gave us every Christmas and birthday . <p> In the country , I had cousins but no voluntary friends . Then Radcliffe took me on for charity , let me wait tables in the dorm . I made friends with Amy , a small , dark , quiet girl I waited on , who was smart and funny when you got to know her , privately , and had the finest taste I 'd ever even seen . She was from the Upper East Side of New York , and she got married after our sophomore year and moved back home . <p> I heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , Alex , and their little boy . Amy had a gift for friendship , and I often cried when we talked , as if I were in therapy . She had in fact become a therapist , but had to limit her practice , while Alex was chief surgeon of a major hospital , and wrote books in his spare time , about medicine and ethics , life and death . " Poetry , " The New York Times had called his last , which spent a few months on the bestseller list . <p> Why did n't I call Amy more ? I picked the phone up , punched her number in . <p> " But how did you know ? " she cried . " I 'm coming up to Boston for a conference . Let 's have lunch at the Blacksmith House . " <p> I had no qualms . Amy was the most discreet person I knew , and she never even gossiped or said mean things about anyone . Merely being seen with her should raise me in the eyes of all those supercilious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she met me there , she looked the way that I remembered , lovely and well-dressed . She could look natural inside a tailored skirt , a cashmere sweater , pearls , at eleven in the morning , in 1998 , and I felt tasteless in my tight black pants and chunky shoes , like some fake teen . My hair had never once been so well-cut as hers , in a simple shape from some hairdresser whom you needed a hereditary link to see . <p> " You look wonderful , " I said . " Mind if I just go shoot myself ? " <p> " Do n't do that , please . I like the way you look . It 's so . . . caj , " she said , meaning casual , and I felt a rush of pleasure . The last time I had seen her , we decided that should be the term for suave , cool style . I was touched that she remembered what we 'd talked about . <p> We carried tea and mesculin salads up the stairs , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest mothers with children . But soon a troop of Japanese tourists came shyly in . The Swedish grad student wedged next to me and flashed her young pink breast , as if we had agreed that she should always nurse by me . <p> " Are you all right ? " Amy murmured . " Everything okay ? " <p> I felt the urge to cry , because I missed Ricky and had no money for haircuts . But I held it off a moment , almost happy , knowing I could tell it all to her . <p> Suddenly she gave me a big blazing look . Her eyes looked huge and black , intense . <p> " Well , I 'm not all right . Alex told me last weekend he does n't want me anymore . We 've only made love about twice in the past year , and I asked him why . I took my clothes off , waved my breasts around , and nothing happened . I asked if he has any sexual feelings , and he just looked uncomfortable . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's fucking someone else ! " <p> At tables nearby , conversation ceased . I tried to notice only what she 'd said . Alex was urbane and charming , asked intelligent questions about my work . The last time I saw him , he 'd started to go bald and grown his hair long on one side to comb across . I caught a glimpse of him emerging from the shower , a wing of hair about a foot long jutted from his ear . Was that some kind of danger sign I should have recognized ? <p> I kept my voice down . " Maybe he 's just getting middle-aged . You 've been married a long time . " <p> Her voice stayed loud . " But I 'm still horny , and why should n't he be , too ? Bald guys have lots of testosterone . I bet he 's having tooth-and-claw sex with some nurse right now . It makes me so angry ! And horny ! You know that awful kind of horny you get when you think that everyone is having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped her head back on her neck . Around the room , no one moved . The tattooed bus-nerd lingered near our table , stared . If Amy noticed , she did n't care . <p> " You know what I want to do ? I want to masturbate some guy while telling him how much I hate him . Does n't that sound great ? Go fuck yourself , you say and yank on it . Go fuck yourself ! " <p> Sometimes life presents you with a test , and you have ten seconds to pass or fail . I had failed most of them so far . Did it matter that I 'd never wanted to do what she 'd said ? <p> " Wow , sure does ! " I cried . " Jerk off the jerk ! Only you should n't do it all the way . Just almost , and then say , ' My hand is tired . ' Tell him you 're going to find some guy who does n't have to comb his hair across his big bald spot ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all the time ! " <p> " He 'll beg for it ! " <p> " He 'll be your slave ! " <p> " And you can tie him up and torture him ! " <p> Amy giggled , stared at me , along with everyone else in the Blacksmith House . <p> " Well , I suppose , if that 's what you like , " she said demurely , sipped her tea . <p> A week later , another therapist told Amy that Alex did indeed have someone else . Not a nurse , but a psychiatrist whose name was practically a household word . She wrote articles for The New Yorker and commentaries for All Things Considered , and Alex had been seeing her for years . All the therapists in New York knew , except Amy . When she confronted him , he seemed relieved . He moved to an apartment near his hospital . <p> " Everyone knew but me ! " Amy shouted on the phone . We had been talking for so long , the phone burned against my ear . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his plan ? " <p> " He says they thought I was too vulnerable . They thought ! Him and his concubine , like I 'm this patient in their care ! I think everyone 's been doing that to me . Did you know he was seeing her ? Would you have told me if you did ? " <p> " No way . " I felt a qualm . Could I have lied and kept it to myself , and would that have been better ? I wished with sudden violence that I could talk to Celia . <p> " Are you glad you know ? Do you still like the person who told you ? " <p> " I do . I like her more . Where would I be without her ? In the dark ! When I think of everyone who knew and kept the truth from me ! " <p> I took the train down to New York and sat up half the night on Amy 's couch , talking it all through . Punchy in the dawn , we told each other jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light bulb , and how many art critics . I told the one about the penguin who tried to drive across a desert , but its car broke down . The penguin took the car to a garage and went into an ice cream parlor to cool off , and covered itself in vanilla ice cream . <p> " Looks like you blew a seal , " said the mechanic , coming in . <p> " Naw , " said the penguin . " This is just ice cream . " <p> We laughed and squeaked . Amy tried to speak . <p> " What do you call that ugly piece of flesh on the end of a man 's penis ? " <p> I did n't know . <p> " That 's . . . the man ! " <p> A few weeks later , back in Cambridge , my phone rang at one a.m . <p> " I have to find a man , " said Amy , in a panicked voice . " I want to have sex right this minute ! How do you find men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew were either married , or untrustworthy , or recently divorced and needed time in the emotional deep freeze . Half of them were my old lovers anyway , and I 'd already told her what was wrong with them . <p> " I do n't care ! He can be a jerk , and live in Timbuktu . So long as he 'll fuck me ! " <p> Two weeks later , Amy had found Steve , a nice genetic researcher at NYU , younger than she was . She did n't call me for a week . I left messages , and she called back a few times . But she was busy now with Steve , and her divorce , and juggling her practice and her son . Soon we only talked to each other 's answering machines . <p> I understood , though I was shocked to realize how few resources I had left . I had nothing but my dissertation , and even that was getting done . I applied for jobs , and went down to a conference in New York for interviews with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd be with Steve all afternoon . But could I meet her around six at her favorite sushi place ? <p> The sushi bar was tiny and crowded , and Amy was half an hour late . They would n't seat me until she arrived , so I had to stand . At last she breezed in through the bamboo-decorated door , flushed and grinning in a rumpled tweed suit , and they put us at a table about two feet wide , in the center of the tiny space . She looked great , but she 'd been drinking martinis all afternoon and seemed unable to talk quietly . Her voice was high and powered by a laugh . <p> " God , is n't sex great ? " she yelped . " Is it always so great for you ? Is that what you 've been doing all these years , fucking every afternoon ? " <p> I murmured that , as she knew , I had not seen anyone for several months . <p> She shouted sympathetically : " But you have to find someone ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Alex to fuck me twice a year . I would have fucked the FedEx man . Surely you know someone you can fuck ! " <p> I wondered if such things were shouted all over the country now , wherever women met . I could n't take it anymore . I snapped . <p> " Let 's not talk about this in a sushi bar , okay ? " <p> " Okay , sure . Sorry . " <p> Sake , she gestured to the waitress from across the room , holding up her hands to imitate the china bottle and the cup . <p> " If it makes you uncomfortable . But just tell me one thing . " A giggle squirted out of her . " Do n't you think sex is great ? " <p> After that , I did without close friends . Sometimes I did talk to another grad student , Lisbeth , who was English and even more bitter than me about the years we 'd spent in school . When we started , Lisbeth had been glamorous and willowy , but now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pudding , with a red face and broken vessels in her cheeks . She liked to say things like , " Mmmmm , Dom Perignon , and such a full bottle ! " She liked to slander women we both knew . She insisted so-and-so " would screw a bush if she thought there was a snake in it , " or that no inch of someone else was untouched by the surgeon 's knife . A man we both knew had a lovely wife , who happened to be rich , and of course Lisbeth said he 'd only married her for money . I knew Lisbeth 's intentions were not especially good , and I mostly steered clear of her . <p> My final year at Harvard came down to a pinched , reluctant spring . In June the sun burned through , and lilacs opened , sweet enough to make your temples pound . I got a job at one of the Midwestern colleges , where I would know no one . But my fellowship was over , and I had to go . I filed my dissertation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before I had to leave , I walked through Harvard Yard . It was hot summer now , and I could smell cut grass , Chinese restaurant , hints of sewage from the Charles . Circling the square , I visited the stations of my youth . On the brick sidewalk , I could see Celia ahead of me look back laughing , in a ripped tank top and ragged cutoff jeans . The bricks were there , the yellow light on them . But where was Celia ? <p> I 'd been invited to a party , in a loft in Watertown . Everyone I knew in Cambridge would be there , and I was tempted not to go , avoid saying goodbye . But I had nothing left to do . At nine o'clock , I dressed and took a cab . <p> The loft was in a warehouse with big clanking metal doors , the room high-ceilinged as a barn , a hundred people packed inside . The first person I saw was Lisbeth , face already splotched . She held a drink in one fist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ! " she cried and kissed me on the lips , which no woman had ever done before . Startled , I stepped back . Her voice rose as if eager for an audience . <p> " And to think that I just had a call this very afternoon from Celia ! " <p> Arrested , I stared like a cow unaware it has been shot in the head . Celia called Lisbeth ? <p> " Oh , but how tactless of me . What a shock it must be for you to hear that . Can you ever forgive me ? Here , let me get you a drink . " <p> She took hold of my arm and dragged me off to find a double scotch . Then she backed me in a corner , stood too close , and offered me a cigarette . <p> " Pardon me , it slipped my mind . Your marvelous pure lungs , like Celia 's . You two were always quite the pair ! But you seem rather sensible , next to her . Poor Celia 's quite batty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those eight or nine small boys . I thought the worst was when she needed to be Born Again , as if once were n't bad enough . Tent meetings , all that , passing out for God , that sort of thing . And of course she 's always been a positively devoted hypochondriac , exists on rice and greens . " <p> She took a drink , and her shoulders shot up with eagerness to swallow it and tell me more . <p> " And now ! The horror ! She 's become a Catholic . A lay nun , no less , part-time bride of Christ , and scribbled a book to enlighten the rest of us . God Is My Co-Dependent , I believe it 's called , or perhaps it 's Going All the Way with God . Still married to the country parson , though , alas . " <p> I tried not to show that every word of this was more than I had ever heard . Lisbeth shrugged my murmurs off and stared into my eyes , as if she knew this news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , you do realize , I trust , my dear , that she is nothing to disturb yourself about . She has become a very ordinary housewife . " <p> " Disturb myself about ? " <p> She shook her head , as if to dislodge a fly . " Oh , you know , your lesbian period . We all knew about it at the time . Such a good idea , I always thought . So sensible of you ! It 's just that Celia could n't bear it , though , you see . She recoiled , in fact . Oh , dear , I fear I have stepped in it , have n't I ? Can you ever forgive me ? Let me take you out to lunch , say , Thursday at the Blacksmith House ? " <p> I escaped , and made no dates . I went home and tried to blot out Lisbeth 's voice . Had everyone believed I was in love with Celia ? Had Celia thought I was ? I knew it was n't true , and yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderers outside my door , and woke up every twenty minutes all night long . <p> In the morning , big white cruise-ship clouds stood motionless against a hot blue sky . I packed up my last things , and the phone began to ring . I had forgotten to unplug the answering machine . A woman 's voice began to speak . <p> " I had to call . I had a message . It was very clear . " <p> It was a dry Maine voice , full of salt cod . It took me several moments to be sure . <p> " It was the strangest thing . I was just praying , and I knew . I had to call . " <p> I picked up the phone . My tongue would n't move . <p> " So , Celia . How 've you been for six or seven years ? " <p> Sharp intake of breath . " It has n't been that long . " <p> Who was I to argue with someone who heard from God ? <p> " Okay . What did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . It was just a feeling , that I had to talk to you . But when it happens , I do n't question it . " <p> I felt impatient with the call . Had she had my number all this time , like when I was plotting to dispose of my remains ? <p> " So , hey , Celia . Why did you stop speaking to me ? " <p> She seemed to expect this . " That 's too big a question to answer on the phone . Meet me in an hour at the Blacksmith House . " <p> " Okay , " I said before I thought , and Celia hung up . <p> So she was in town . She had swooped in , and now I was to report as ordered . Had she come to prove me wrong about the democratic nature of friendship ? Was I supposed to just eat mesculin salad with her as if nothing had happened ? <p> Sweating , I drifted to the Blacksmith House . The moment I saw Celia , I felt calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did look like a nun , or an old-maid clerk in 1956-stick-thin , in a Peter Pan collar and lace-up shoes . Her hair was bowl-cut , but her eyes were still Coke-bottle green , and when she saw me , something impish flashed through them . She walked toward me with languid grace . <p> " But you look wonderful , " she said , as if she had heard differently . She kissed my cheek , and laughed her airy laugh . <p> " Hey , thanks . Want some lunch ? They make good salads here , " I said , as if she 'd never been there before . " I mean , they 've gotten better lately . " <p> " Sure . " She laughed again , breathless , as if this were hilarious . She seemed astonished to be there with me . <p> We carried salads up the stairs . The place was packed , but without piles of snowsuits , there was more room . The baby of the Swedish grad student could now sit up . Most of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be the same . <p> Celia showed me pictures of her two small sons , and Daniel , and the white church where he led the flock . Daniel was even thinner than before , his face ashen , as if he 'd been incinerated from within . He looked ill in his white collar , and even in the Santa suit he had put on for a children 's party at the church . But their boys were round and rosy , cheerful , with pink cheeks . <p> " And have you joined the Catholic Church ? " <p> " Oh , yes ! " She flushed with happiness , and told me all the steps she had gone through , and what a lay nun was , and that she had n't taken vows and might not . But she said Daniel understood and even envied her . <p> I got us coffee , cream for her , the way she 'd always taken it . She was pleased that I remembered , and gave me a searching glance . She played with the flimsy cream package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thought about it now for years , of course . I 'm not sure what to say . " <p> " You do n't have to , if you do n't feel like it , " I said in a rush , not meaning to . Of course she had to say . I had almost killed myself , but I was over it . What could she say now that would make a difference ? <p> " Just tell me why you would n't take my calls . You could have explained . It 's not like we were n't talking every day . " <p> She waved one hand , laughed quick clean puffs . " I know , I know . " <p> She seemed unable to go on . But something in her face told me I had to wait . I waited , wishing that I did n't need to know . <p> She did say something then . I know I heard it , saw her lips move and her eyes beseeching me . But seconds later I could not remember what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it in . Or maybe it was what I 'd always thought , that , being married , she could no longer approve of me . Whatever she said , it might have held the secret of friendship . <p> But it was gone the moment she said it , and part of me began to keen , and shred its handkerchief , its plastic garbage sack . What did she say ? It was as if no one was listening at all . <p> Celia seemed relieved , and talked with animation , asked questions about my life . I told her , leaving out the year with the psychiatrist , since it seemed rude to mention it . She talked about her children 's choir , her husband 's early midlife crisis , and how impatient she felt with it . <p> " He actually said lately that he does n't know if he believes in God . As if he 's twenty-two ! The weekend he said it , we 'd had this major breakthrough , too . I did n't think there were any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breakthrough ? " I said , not really following . <p> She flushed happily , began to shout . <p> " It was the most amazing thing . You know how , when you 're fucking , and you feel the Holy Ghost descend ? And your orgasm sends you up to a higher dimension ? " <p> Around us , people froze . The same wait-nerd who 'd been there every time appeared a few yards off , perforated ears opened wide . <p> I did n't pause . I shouted back . <p> " Your orgasm ? The Holy Ghost shows up when you come ? Do tell ! How does it feel ? " <p> I leaned back . I relaxed . At last I knew what was going on . I knew where we were headed to . Lifting my cup , I nodded encouragement , as Celia went on . <p> <p> By Cornelia Nixon <p>
