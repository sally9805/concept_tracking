One thing we know about the man who wrote Alice in Wonderland  --  he loved little girls . The uneasy question has always been , How much ? Lewis Carroll , whose real name was Arthur Dodgson , was a passionate photographer as well as a writer and mathematician . At his death in 1898 , he left behind hundreds of pictures , many of the " little misses " he doted on all his life . There has never been evidence that Carroll took advantage of them sexually . But over time those pictures , along with his rapturous diary entries about his prepubescent " girl-friends , " have made Carroll something like the Michael Jackson of Victorian letters . The more he goes on about children , the more he gives you the creeps . <P> The Alice books are forever  --  they are the most popular and best-loved works of children 's literature . The Lewis Carroll problem is forever too . But it has been dropped back into our laps by a new exhibition and a fascinating new book . " Dreaming in Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adults and children at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that will travel to Houston , New York and Chicago . It appears at the same time as The Lives of the Muses ( HarperCollins ; 416 pages ) , a supple work of cultural history by novelist Francine Prose , whose subject is the women who have inspired creative men from Samuel Johnson to John Lennon . She tells us , " The lives of the muses greatly expand our limited notions of Eros , " and she includes within those notions Carroll 's not quite sexual , not quite chaste infatuations . Prose devotes a chapter to Alice Liddell , the little girl who inspired Alice in Wonderland . Carroll contrived the story to entertain her on a warm afternoon in 1862 , then wrote it all down because she asked him to . <P> The San Francisco show , organized by Douglas R. Nickel , the museum 's photo curator , wants to convince us that Carroll could have had entirely innocent aims in his child photography . Prose takes the wiser course of treating Carroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Wiser because Carroll 's fervent attachment to little girls seems sweaty to us now . He met them on trains , at stores , on beaches . He carried puzzles in his pocket to beguile them and wrote them letters to remind them that " we still remember each other , and feel a sort of shivery affection for each other . " <P> Scholars always warn that we should not look at 19th century images through modern eyes , finding sex where the Victorians saw only creamy innocence . But however you might describe Carroll 's famous picture of Alice , 7 , costumed as a sultry beggar girl , girlish is not the word . Her liquid posture , that off-the-shoulder dress , the frank suction of her gaze  --  innocence this luscious could almost have an R rating . From here to the foxy cowgirl outfits of JonBenet Ramsey is n't a stretch . While Prose doubts that Carroll was an active pedophile , she does not deny the erotic longing in his pictures .
