<p> STATE SHOULD FUND BUS OPERATIONS <p> Editor  --  Your May 15 article about the lack of parking at Bay Area ferry terminals ( as well as past articles about parking shortages at BART stations ) points out one of the major problems with Bay Area transportation planning . A lot of the attention and money goes to sexy , shiny new projects ( BART extensions , ferry network ) , without any thought to how people will get to these forms of transportation . Mass transit is supposed to get people out of their cars , yet we insist on building transit that requires people to drive to the station . <p> The time has come to fully fund local bus service so Bay Area residents can leave their cars ( and hassles ) at home . But there is no leadership on this issue in Sacramento . Local bus companies need money to pay drivers , but Gov . Gray Davis ' new transportation plan only pays for " capital costs , " that is to say , new equipment or construction projects , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Call or write your legislators and tell them to get us out of traffic-and-parking gridlock . <p> STEPHAN VON POHL <p> Alliance for AC Transit <p> And Bus Riders Union <p> Oakland <p> . <p> MOVING BOTTLENECK <p> Editor  --  Re : Caldecott Tunnel Folly . <p> Another learned transportation study has called for the elimination of yet another freeway bottleneck by adding another two lanes to the Caldecott Tunnel . With two more lanes , some travelers would experience shorter waits at the tunnel , at least until job growth east of the tunnel eventually fills up the new lanes . <p> But would these drivers benefit ? Reverse-commute travelers would win a few extra minutes , if they saved time at the tunnel and experienced no countervailing delays elsewhere . If they did encounter delays elsewhere , the net benefit could easily amount to nothing . <p> The problem with eliminating freeway bottlenecks is that they do n't go away , they just relocate . Many Caltrans officials regard freeway-bottleneck elimination as improvement , regardless of the impact on cities . " We send ' em in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . " Pretty neat . <p> GERALD CAUTHEN <p> Oakland <p> . <p> ENDANGERING WOMEN <p> Editor  --  I want to focus on the recent false statements about alleged negative physical and emotional effects of abortion . " Women and Abortion : Another Voice " ( Open Forum , May 9 ) made a number of unsubstantiated statements . <p> Women 's health is safeguarded by legal and affordable abortion services . With timely and safe abortions , women are protected from possible future infertility and miscarriage . Early abortion with appropriate medical procedures is , in fact , an extremely safe medical procedure . Indeed , pregnancy offers greater risk to a woman 's health than such an abortion . <p> It is the campaign against abortion rights that has endangered women 's health by making these services much more difficult to obtain . As a feminist , I support comprehensive reproductive choice education and medical care . Only a complete range  --  from various forms of birth control to services that protect fertility and allow for healthy births  --  gives " choice " meaning . <p> To bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrenching emotional impacts . When a woman chooses not to carry a pregnancy to term , I offer her support in the sacred act of making a thoughtful choice . With her , I shall mourn a lost possibility  --  and celebrate the many futures her choice opens . <p> DARIEN DE LU <p> Oakland <p> . <p> SUBSTITUTE FUND <p> Editor  --  With all the news of Gov . Gray Davis ' plan to give billions to our schools , I would like to bring attention to a desperate need for some of that money . <p> My son attends Golden Gate Academy in San Francisco . In March , his teacher abruptly went on a leave of absence only weeks before the state testing was to start , leaving the class at the mercy of a substitute teacher . <p> Since the departure of this teacher , these fourth-graders have had more than 11 substitute teachers , little or no homework and sometimes were sent out to other classrooms because there was no teacher at all . What parent would want to see their child in this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation . <p> CATHERINE BURFORD <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ACKERMAN 'S RECORD <p> Editor  --  I read the May 16 front-page article on Arlene Ackerman 's leap from the " troubled " District of Columbia school position to the head of San Francisco schools . I read it twice . Nowhere did I see reference to how Ms. Ackerman propelled D.C. schools to the top of the standings in educational achievement . There was no reference to anything in her record that improved the finances , morale , student scores or crime record , for that matter , in the schools under her management . <p> There was a recent Wall Street Journal article about Ms. Ackerman 's fight against vouchers . Instructive article . I wish that your reporters had dug it up . While they 're at it , they should look at the Seattle schools ' attempts to keep out private contributors who wanted to invest to improve things . Ms. Ackerman was at the forefront of that as well . <p> San Francisco schools are a disgrace . Most supervisors , most elected officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or parochial schools . Or they choose to live outside the district to avoid the catastrophe we call an " educational system . " We treat the schools as an issue-laden dumping ground for kids who have no other choice . <p> Most voters here do n't send their children to schools here . They should . Perhaps then they 'd push for someone better than Ms. Ackerman  --  someone who could actually make things better . <p> JOHN P. LONERGAN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BATTLE FATIGUE <p> Editor  --  We would like to thank you for the positive article on chronic fatigue syndrome " New Research Debunks Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Myth , " Open Forum , May 12 ) . However , the research mentioned in this article is hardly new ; most was published nearly a decade ago . The latest research involves infectious agents such as HHV-6 and mycoplasma , further studies indicating low-circulating-blood volume and hypercoagulation due to immune activation , and additional findings that would indicate that CFS is the same illness as Gulf War Syndrome . <p> The 1999 prevalence study cited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control , and was actually done by Dr. Leonard Jason at DePaul University . CDC has failed to perform adequate epidemiological studies on this illness , and has never done a pediatric study . <p> Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a devastating disease in children and often remains unrecognized or misdiagnosed . Another recent study by Dr. Jason found that only 2 percent of the children identified had been correctly diagnosed . Without a proper diagnosis , these sick children fall through the cracks medically and academically , unable to get proper treatment or educational accommodations and are frequently dismissed as school phobic or depressed . <p> Our organization has an information on CFS in children .

NO THANKS <p> Editor  --  How stupid are teachers ? Here 's a clue : We are n't going to jump for joy over a $50 per month " raise " through tax credits . Add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and watch crime go down , social values change , and educated people take back the system . <p> I 've taught college for five years and earned $17,000 during my best year . Who 's taking care of your children ? Not me , not anymore .
