But documents obtained by the Sun-Times show that one Blagojevich campaign backer went to a hospital and another ended up the subject of a monthlong police investigation . <p> Ultimately , it all was kept quiet when the injured man decided not to press charges  --  after telling investigators a high-ranking aide to the governor urged him to drop the case . <p> The two main players in this drama have gone on to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to Blagojevich .
