The Craze to reform corporate accounting gets things exactly backward . <p> WHAT DO WE MEAN BY " PROFIT " ? That question became a national issue in the wake of the NASDAQ collapse and business scandals at Enron , WorldCom , Tyco and the rest . The conventional wisdom blames it all on cheating in reporting profits  --  accounting gimmicks used to inflate earnings per share and thus hype stock values . This in turn is said to create " bubbles "  --  a word I persist in surrounding with quotation marks out of respect for the historic record of the capital markets in directing investment to good use . <p> The key to averting " bubbles , " we thus are told , is rectitude in accounting  --  the measurement of profit . The nation 's business must return to the lodestar of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles , as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board . And these bodies must enact higher standards , stamping out the sinful practices wayward corporations invented to avoid the path of righteousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land , with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act . Chief executives and financial officers must swear by their reports under penalty of jail . Audit committees must include a " financial expert , " with the definition of that term left unspecified and likely to be decided in class action lawsuits . A new authority is chartered to police the accountants , making sure they do n't let their clients get away with anything . <p> This has engendered great debate on many arcane issues  --  to take one example , the correct accounting for co-payments on prescription drugs by members of company health plans . But the centerpiece is employee stock options , widely blamed for the excesses of the " bubble . " <p> BEYOND QUESTION , option grants are worth something , even if they ca n't be converted into stock or cash until vested . And if they are compensation it would seem to follow that they 're a similar expenditure for the corporation , whose accounts should therefore be duly charged . <p> The problem , for starters , is that no one knows what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Wall Street traders , assumes a liquid market . No such market exists for employee grants . There is the added dilemma of accounting for options that expire " out of the money . " Does the corporation then reverse the original charge , and would the resulting volatility really improve the reporting of its profit ? Then too , options already appear in the denominator of the earnings/share calculations , since security analysts routinely calculate outstanding shares on a " fully diluted " basis . Should they count in the numerator too ? Yet if grants are simply ignored , obviously the calculations are missing an expense . What is to be done ? <p> There being no good answer to this question , it seems to me we should wonder whether there 's something wrong with the underlying exercise . If earnings per share really turn on such recondite issues , I for one suspect that earnings per share is not a very robust measure of corporate performance or prospects . <p> Economists , as it happens , long ago recognized that profit is something of a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progenitors of today 's Chicago School of economics , published Risk , Uncertainty and Profit  --  in fact his doctoral dissertation , written a decade earlier . Knight starts by surveying the various ways economists have treated the subject over the years . <p> The crude Marxist labor theory of value , for example , holds that profit is any income to a proprietor  --  the better to justify notions of class struggle . But as far back as Adam Smith , more careful economists have recognized this as fallacious . A proprietor typically provides an enterprise with management , for example  --  a task as deserving of a wage as the sweat of the workman on the factory floor . So part of his return is not " profit " but compensation . <p> EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY , the proprietor contributes capital , without which no product or jobs could be created . Even before the development of modern finance , land could be put out to rent , which would not vary with the success of the enterprise using it . That is something very different from profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by borrowing or by issuing equity . But every enterprise has to compete for the capital pool . Lenders charge interest , while providers of equity have an opportunity cost  --  what they could earn elsewhere , typically measured by the prevailing rate of interest . Like rents on land , opportunity cost is fixed , whether the enterprise succeeds or fails . So interest on equity is not profit . <p> Various other charges have historically been paid out of the proprietor 's share . Knight distinguished between risk and uncertainty . Risk was subject to actuarial determination , while uncertainty was not measurable . Risk is an ongoing expense  --  the cost of insurance . Profit is the result of uncertainty  --  what 's left after all the hired factors of production have been paid . <p> Thoughtful commentators have continued to follow these careful distinctions . In the 1970s , I persuaded management legend Peter Drucker to write an ongoing column for the Wall Street Journal . His first entry was entitled " The Delusion of ' Profits . ' " Its sweeping conclusion : " The essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are only costs . " <p> Drucker 's initial column was quickly followed by a broadside entitled " Measuring Business Performance . " It started , " One of the basic causes of poor performance on the part of analysts , investors and business managers is the yardstick they use to determine how a business is doing  --  ' earnings per share . ' " The only thing that measures , he pointed out , is taxable earnings  --  what remained after all the charges the tax collector accepts as deductible . In other words , a purely arbitrary figure that has little to do with business performance . <p> In its stead , Drucker proposed a reform focused on what really produces wealth : " The key figure for this is return on all assets ( or on capital employed ) , related to cash needs , to cost of capital , to risks and needs . This rather than the meaningless ' earnings per share ' figure is what the public , the SEC , analysts and , above all , the stockholders should expect  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual statements . " <p> Knight , in his scholarly fashion , had taken up a similar point of distinction between economic profit  --  what really matters  --  and mere accounting profit . The question , he notes , " has tended to constitute an issue between accountants and economic theorists . " But he concludes that the debate is " entirely uncalled-for , " because " the difference in opinion is a matter of obvious difference in standpoint . " The economist is interested in the forces of production , while the accountant " is interested in proprietorship . " <p> From the standpoint of public policy , Knight lets the accountants off rather easily . The purpose of capital markets is to direct scarce capital to its highest uses , and this is measured not by accounting profits but by economic profits . To translate the accounting profits reported by business into the economic profits that determine values , we have evolved a whole new discipline , called securities analysis . <p> SECURITIES ANALYSTS SUFFERED a considerable black eye in the recent market collapse , especially those who became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society has evolved the alternative punishment of pursuit by a pack of tort lawyers . But at their best , analysts convert earnings per share into numbers such as rates of return and discounted cash flows , which determine share values and direct capital to its best uses . <p> These issues were scarcely discussed as Sarbanes-Oxley swept to a 97-0 victory in the U.S. Senate . The House , initially hesitant , felt impelled to accede almost completely to the Senate bill . Everyone understood that the problem at Enron , WorldCom and American business generally was that they and their accountants had strayed from the path of rectitude marked by GAAP calculations of earnings per share , which is to say , the accounting view of profit . And thus greater rectitude about GAAP will restore investor confidence , both in the accounting profession and in the securities markets . <p> AS THE BILL PASSED , the Wall Street Journal did publish one caveat . " The cruel reality is that the ' bottom line ' for a Fortune 500 company in an accrual-based accounting system like the Generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of guesstimates , " warned an experienced investment manager , Jeffrey Bronchick of Reed , Conner &; Birdwell , in Los Angeles . " ... Intelligent and constructive securities analysis has always been the painstaking construction of a mosaic of factors , and if Washington and the SEC think they can construct one acceptable number to help people who wo n't bother to open the annual report , then they are setting people up for additional pain . " <p> But no one was prepared to listen to such counsel . Last January , the SEC implemented the Sarbanes-Oxley directives by issuing Regulation G , effective in March . If a company 's report includes " non-GAAP financial measures , " it must also include a reconciliation of such figures with GAAP reports , as well as include a " statement of purpose " explaining how such figures help investors . If non-GAAP measures are released orally or in presentations to analysts , the reconciliation is to be included on a specified company website . <p> ESPECIALLY IN CONJUNCTION with the threat of class-action lawsuits , the practical effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular measures as EBITDA  --  earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization . And also such pro forma concepts as operating cash flow per share or core earnings from ongoing operations . It 's true of course that such calculations have not been standardized across companies , and are hence subject to abuse . But it 's also true that they are often attempts to translate accounting profit into economic profit , an effort by companies to give ordinary investors the benefit of at least part of the work done by securities analysts and sophisticated investors . <p> The notion that stifling the flow of information helps investors and improves the operations of financial markets is , to say the least , counterintuitive . So it 's not surprising that a few , so far lonely , dissenters have arisen to challenge the Sarbanes-Oxley consensus . The most substantive challenges I 've found come from Peter J. Wallison , a Washington lawyer and former U.S. Treasury general counsel now associated with the American Enterprise Institute , and G. Bennett Stewart III at Stern Stewart &; Co , developers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND STEWART start with a different explanation of our recent experience in the securities markets . The former , for example , asserts that even without cheating GAAP , corporate managers can manipulate earnings per share by changing assumptions about such things as reserves and depreciation rates . These manipulations have been widely used in " earnings management "  --  meeting earnings-per-share targets set by expectations of " The Street " or the company 's own guidance . Wallison describes <p> ... a game in which analysts and investors were testing the quality of a company 's started earnings by determining whether management could hit its targets . If it could , that meant the company 's earnings were probably growing , although not necessarily as stated . If it could not , that was a signal that the company had run out of ways of adjusting its results to produce earnings growth , and that in turn suggested that its earnings had really fallen quite dramatically . It was because of this that we saw the strange market phenomenon in which companies that missed their earnings targets by a penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their share prices . <p> Stewart put it more succinctly : <p> As accounting has lost its anchor to value , it has forfeited its stature and authority . It has degenerated into a game whose main aim is prettying earnings reports . When there is no standard or overarching mission , and the corporate accountant 's charge is simply to " beat the Street , " Enron and WorldCom are but a step removed . <p> The problem , in other words , was not too little emphasis on GAAP as a measure of profit but too much . Corporate managers understand , for example , that even the wisest investment decisions will lower their short-term earnings , and that many things that boost those same earnings are not wise in the long run . They know that quarterly earnings per share is not an ultimate measure of success . But their bonuses are often tied to per-share earnings , and their visits with Wall Street analysts persuade them that the same figure will determine the value of their options . And once they enter this alternate universe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the line separating " earnings management " from fraud . <p> Enron 's 2001 annual report bragged , for example , " we are laser-focused on earnings-per-share . " And one of the quickest , and most problematical , ways to increase reported earnings is by using debt instead of equity capital  --  that is , by leveraging the corporation . This was precisely what Enron did , stretching beyond prudence and  --  with CFO Andrew Fastow now under indictment and other high officers still under investigation  --  likely beyond the law . <p> FRANK PARTNOY , professor of law at the University of San Diego , told a Senate committee he took a look at Enron 's risk manual and found the following amazing quotation : <p> Reported earnings follow the rules and principles of accounting . The results do not always create measures consistent with underlying economics . However , corporate management 's performance is generally measured by accounting income , not underlying economics . Risk management strategies are therefore directed at accounting rather than economic performance . <p> The Enron debacle might have been avoided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic profit . And if Enron is simply an extreme case of what afflicted corporate America in the late 1990s , the route to reform does n't lie in more rigorously adhering to GAAP and per-share earnings , but in developing other measures that are a more meaningful reflection of the economic performance of corporations . <p> While Wallison and Stewart agree in their diagnosis and on the need for better measures , they disagree on what those new measures should be . The difference is itself instructive . <p> Wallison , the lawyer , adheres to the old accounting maxim , " Profit is an opinion ; cash is a fact . " He argues that in the modern world  --  and especially when corporations derive most of their income from intangible assets  --  " the traditional idea that income statements should endeavor to account for both revenues and costs in the same period does not work . " Sophisticated investors already look past GAAP results , he notes , and focus on estimates of future cash flows . " The SEC could accomplish a great deal immediately , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible to ordinary investors . " <p> Stewart , by contrast , is intent on making accrual accounting work . Stern Stewart 's Economic Value Added idea , focusing on economic profit , has won a considerable following as an internal management tool at important corporations . Wal-Mart , for instance , was cash-flow negative in eighteen of its first twenty years , during which time rapid reinvestment of earnings was building huge value . EVA attempts to capture such value creation by adjusting accrual accounting to align it with economic profit . Stewart wants to see companies replace or supplement GAAP earnings by making EVA-type information available to investors . <p> STEWART RECOGNIZES that his proposals would " rock the foundations of accounting , " but his adjustments are instructive . By far the most important is to deduct a charge against income for the use of equity capital . This would be entirely familiar to Peter Drucker and Frank Knight , if not Adam Smith : unless a corporation earns more than the going rate of interest , it is destroying value even it reports earnings as measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest on equity in the " proprietor 's share "  --  is a massive distortion of economic reality . <p> Another accounting earthquake Stewart proposes would capitalize investment in intangibles . Such things as training expenses , new product promotion , and research and development would not be charged against current income , but depreciated over their estimated economic lives . Accounting conventions , he complains , cater to bankers rather than shareholders , stressing liquidation value  --  and therefore hard assets  --  over the ongoing value that brands , management skills and other intangible assets typically carry in a knowledge-based economy . <p> There 's no need to decide between Wallison 's cash flow and Stewart 's EVA to conclude that Sarbanes-Oxley has taken policy in exactly the wrong direction . It will not help confidence in the capital markets to enshrine a misleading number as the Holy Grail of investment , and it certainly will not help the capital markets direct money to its highest uses . Instead of trying to force the flow of corporate information into GAAP 's Procrustean Bed , we should be encouraging the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a debate would be a valuable educational experience , not least for corporate executives and Wall Street analysts . Stewart says his EVA calculations track share values more closely than do conventional earnings per share . Wallison cites numerous studies show that cash flow is a better predictor of share values than are earnings . <p> And tellingly , Stewart reports that for 2001 , the 1,000 largest U.S. firms reported aggregate net income of $96 billion . However , with their book equity of about $2.9 trillion , a ten percent charge for interest on equity would come to $290 billion . So in that ill-fated year , the nominal accounting profit disguised an economic loss twice that size . <p> Peter Drucker noted the same phenomenon back in 1975 . And half a century before that , Frank Knight reported that while the available evidence was inconclusive , he was " strongly of the opinion that business as a whole suffers a loss . The main facts in the psychology of the case are familiar .... The behavior of men in lotteries and gambling tables is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature to exaggerate the value of a small change of large winnings . " <p> The accountant 's view of profits makes it much easier for business executives to report rosy results . It also happens to satisfy their critics , who like to demagogue success , as in " obscene profits . " Neither group wants an accounting system that shows many of these profits are in fact a loss . This might shake the underpinnings of American business . <p> ON THE OTHER HAND , Wall Street has survived the revelation that most financial managers fail to beat the stock market indexes . So I suspect the corporate world would survive the revelation that , in economic terms , most businesses operate at a loss . <p> Movement of reporting and of investor interest away from accounting profits and toward economic profits must be a good thing . It might bruise the egos of CEOs  --  itself probably no bad thing . But shareholders would be better informed , and society 's capital would more easily flow to its most productive uses . Would that we were headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we seem to be headed entirely backward . <p> This article is adapted from the RAND Corporation 's 2003 Charles Wolf Lecture . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Robert L.
