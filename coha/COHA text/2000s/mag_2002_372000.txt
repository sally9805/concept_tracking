On Jon Opsahl 's website there is a photograph of his mother Myrna . She wears a sensible bob and a dimpled smile . Her gingham blouse is buttoned all the way to the top . The grainy black-and-white image is a throwback to an earlier time . But her son 's words running beside it are both clear and current : " We know who was there when she was shotgunned to death ... Twenty-six years is long enough to have waited . " <P> That wait finally ended last Wednesday , when police charged five former figures in the Symbionese Liberation Army , a violent band of ' 70s radicals , with the murder of Myrna Opsahl . In February 1974 the S.L.A. entered the lexicon of domestic terror with the kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst , who was later caught on a bank security camera toting a gun ; in May of that year , the group was nearly wiped out in a fire fight with Los Angeles cops . But there were still plenty of hangers-on , like , allegedly , Sara Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 23 years as a fugitive and sentenced last week to 20 years to life for her role in a failed plot to blow up two police cars . Prosecutors allege that Olson and four others also robbed $15,000 from a suburban Sacramento bank one quiet Monday morning in 1975 and shot Opsahl in the stomach as she was depositing her church 's collection-plate money . <P> This time the guerrillas surrendered quietly , having long ago swapped their ' 70s extremism for 21st century suburban anonymity . William Harris , who served more than eight years in prison along with his ex-wife Emily for their role in kidnapping Hearst , married a lawyer , coaches soccer and works as a private investigator in San Francisco . Police pulled over William , formerly known as General Teko , in his Honda Passport SUV shortly after 8 a.m. , as he was driving his kids to school . Emily , a computer consultant who has gone back to using her maiden name , Montague , was stopped near her suburban Los Angeles home . Michael Bortin , who runs Zen Hardwood Floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside his Victorian house in Portland , Ore . A final suspect , James Kilgore , the only fugitive in the group , vanished decades ago and remains at large . <P> The four have consistently maintained their innocence in the case , which has languished ever since the government tried but failed to convict one S.L.A. figure in the robbery 25 years ago . It was revived with the 1999 arrest of Olson . According to the Sacramento district attorney , the FBI has used new forensic techniques to link the lead pellets in Opsahl 's abdomen to shotgun shells recovered from an S.L.A. safe house . Olson 's guilty plea in the bombing plot reportedly confirmed what Hearst told the FBI decades ago  --  that the loot from the robbery helped finance subsequent S.L.A. crimes . <P> " They are two middle-aged , middle-class people who have paid their debt , " says Stuart Hanlon , who represented Emily and William Harris in their earlier trial and signed on as Emily 's attorney again last week . " It 's like The Twilight Zone . " More of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a different robbery charge , is called to testify . Granted immunity years ago , Hearst described the carefully choreographed heist in her 1982 book , Every Secret Thing , writing that Emily Harris confided she had shot Opsahl , saying " it really does n't matter . She was a bourgeois pig anyway . "
