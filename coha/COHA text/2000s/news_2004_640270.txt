<p> Denver Roman Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput on Tuesday joined a national debate about Communion and the ballot box , writing that denying anyone the Eucharist is a ' very grave matter ' that should be used only in ' extraordinary cases of public scandal . ' <p> However , Chaput stated that Catholics who are ' living in serious sin or who deny the teachings of the church ' - whether they 're public officials or ordinary parishioners - should refrain from taking Communion on their own accord . <p> In his weekly column in the Denver Catholic Register , Chaput joined about 14 other U.S. Catholic prelates who have chimed in on Communion and politics this presidential election year . <p> ' If we claim to believe in Jesus Christ and the Catholic faith , then we need to act like it - without caveats , all the way , all the time , with all our heart , including our lives in the public square , ' Chaput wrote . <p> Chaput 's stance is not nearly as strong as one taken by Colorado Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four line-in-the-sand issues for politicians and said ordinary Catholics jeopardize their salvation if they vote for candidates who are wrong on those issues . <p> Sheridan is the only U.S. bishop to say rank- and-file Catholics may not take Communion if they vote for such dissident Catholic politicians . <p> So far , few of the nation 's Catholic bishops have spoken up on mixing Communion and politics ; whether the bishops can come up with a unified response is likely to be raised next month when the nation 's 300 bishops meet in Denver for a private prayer retreat . <p> In Colorado , an earlier column by Chaput arguing that ' real ' Catholic politicians must oppose abortion rights sparked a tempest in the state 's U.S. Senate race , which includes Democrat Ken Salazar , a Catholic who backs legalized abortion . <p> Salazar responded that Chaput should not be setting litmus tests and that he does n't need to agree with the church on everything to be Catholic . <p> On Tuesday , Salazar said in a statement : ' My faith has always been extremely important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations . I respect the archbishop , but I intend to continue to practice my faith . ' <p> Cody Wertz , a Salazar campaign spokesman , would not say whether that means Salazar would continue taking Communion . He said Salazar and Chaput met privately Monday , but he would not describe the discussion . Chaput sent Salazar a letter requesting a summit weeks before the controversy . <p> Chaput spokesman Sergio Gutierrez said it 's up to Salazar to decide whether he should take Communion , which Catholics believe is the body and blood of Christ . <p> ' The archbishop 's column was not for any one individual but for all Catholics , ' Gutierrez said . ' I certainly hope ( Salazar ) considers what the church teaches in respect to Communion . ' <p> In the column , Chaput mentions sins - ' theft , lying , adultery , pride , gossip , anger , envy , callousness to the poor , pornography or indifference ' - and states Catholics must repent in confession before receiving Communion . <p> ' Likewise , if we ignore or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she teaches , we are not ' in communion ' with the Catholic faith , ' he writes . ' We separate ourselves from the community of believers . If we receive Communion anyway , we engage in a lie . ' <p> Chaput does not single out any church teachings specifically . But previously he has said opposition to abortion rights trumps everything else , arguing other issues ca n't be relevant if life is n't allowed to begin . <p> The letter does not spell out what constitutes ' extraordinary cases of public scandal ' - the one justification Chaput gives for denying Communion . <p> ' But the Church always expects Catholics who are living in serious sin or who deny the teachings of the Church - whether they 're highly visible officials or anonymous parishioners - to have the integrity to respect both the Eucharist and the faithful , and to refrain from receiving Communion , ' Chaput writes . <p> Diana Flahive , founder of Colorado Concerned Catholics , an affiliate of the Boston group Voice of the Faithful , said that if Catholics who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would receive it . She cited the fact that most U.S. Catholics ignore the church 's prohibition on artificial contraception . <p> Flahive also suggested that worthiness to receive Communion be raised in the context of sexual abuse by priests , the coverup by some bishops , the killing of innocents in Iraq and the death penalty . <p> ' To me , these are grave matters of extraordinary public scandal , and I hear no call for refusal of the Eucharist , ' she said . <p> Tim Dore , executive director of the Colorado Catholic Conference , which lobbies the legislature on behalf of the state 's three dioceses , said Chaput 's letter simply states Catholics should use an informed conscience when voting and taking the sacrament . <p> " What he really does is says to the Catholic in the pew , ' You have to deal with it yourself , " ' said Dore , a Democrat who opposes legalized abortion . " You know what you 've done , and you have to have it on your conscience when you come up to Communion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand : <p> At least 15 U.S. bishops have issued comments on Communion and politics this year . A half-dozen bishops from the nation 's 195 dioceses have warned Catholic politicians to refrain from Communion if they break with church teaching against abortion rights . A sampling of where the bishops stand : <p> St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke : In January , stated he would deny Communion to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry , who backs abortion rights . Burke , a canon lawyer , had taken similar stands against politicians when he was a bishop in Wisconsin . <p> Archbishop Sean O'Malley of Boston and Archbishop Alfred Hughes of New Orleans : Hughes in January and O'Malley in March said Catholic politicians who support abortion rights should voluntarily refrain from Communion . However , they said they would not turn away anyone who sought Communion . <p> Bishop Michael Sheridan of Colorado Springs : On May 1 wrote that Catholic politicians may not take Communion if they support abortion rights , euthanasia , gay marriage and stem-cell research using tissue from aborted fetuses . He said the same of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those issues . <p> Newark , N.J. , Archbishop John Myers : On May 5 published a pastoral letter saying it is ' objectively dishonest ' for politicians who favor abortion rights to receive Communion . <p> Archbishop John Vlazny of Portland , Ore. : On May 6 wrote Catholics who publicly dissent on abortion or same-sex marriage should refrain from Communion , but he finds it hard to make a public judgment that any person is ' unfit ' or ' unworthy . ' He wrote that Catholics who vote for politicians ' precisely because they are pro-choice ' should also refrain from the sacrament . However , he says that standard should n't apply if other candidates ' fail significantly ' in matters such as war , human rights and economic justice . <p> Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati : On May 7 told the National Catholic Reporter , ' We need to be very cautious about denying people the sacraments on the basis of what they say they believe , especially when those are political beliefs . ' <p> Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles : On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be welcome to receive Communion in his diocese . ' I 'm puzzled by people rattling sanctions at the moment , ' he said . ' That has not been our tradition over the years . ' <p> Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington , D.C. : On May 13 wrote : " As a priest and bishop , I do not favor a confrontation at the altar rail with the Sacred Body of the Lord Jesus in my hand . There are apparently those who would welcome such a conflict , for good reasons , I am sure , or for political ones , but I would not . " McCarrick heads a committee of bishops studying the issue .
