mind on the road rather than the reasons she 'd left Los Angeles . It would take Herculean strength and the courage of Job , too , to tell her father everything she 'd done since moving away from Texas .... Sighing , she looked away from the rain-streaked windshield long enough to glance at the blue-green numerals on her dashboard clock . Fifteen minutes , tops , and she 'd be home . Dread settled over her like an itchy blanket . Her dad would never come right out and voice his disapproval of her decisions . Instead , he 'd shake his head and say , " It 's your life ... but I think you 'll be sorry .... " He 'd said it when she signed up for Art instead of Bookkeeping in high school , when she traded her scholarship to Texas U. for acting lessons at the community college , when she announced her plans to move to Hollywood and try her hand at acting . Cammi sighed , wondering how old she 'd have to be before her dad no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From out of nowhere , came the angry blare of a car horn , the whoosh-hiss of tires skidding on rain-slicked pavement , the deafening impact of metal smashing into metal .... Then came an instantof utter stillness , punctuated by the soft tinkling of broken glass peppering the blacktop . Cammi loosened her grip on the steering wheel and took stock . She 'd been traveling north , but her fifteen-year-old coupe now faced south in the intersection of Amarillo 's Western Avenue and Plains Boulevard - the very corner where , thirteen years earlier , on a rainy night much like this one , her mother had died in a fiery car wreck . Still reeling from the shock of the impact , Cammi stepped shakily onto the pavement . She did n't seem to be hurt , and prayed whoever was in the other car had been as fortunate . Not much hope of that , though - the vehicle reminded her more of a modern-art sculpture than a pickup . The truck 's side window had shattered on impact , making it impossible to see the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello ... hello ? Are you all right in there ? " " I 'm fine , no thanks to you , " came the gruff reply . The door slowly opened with a loud , protesting groan . One pointy-toed cowboy boot thumped to the ground , immediately followed by the other . " Are you crazy ? " the driver demanded as he stood and faced her . Pedestrians had gathered on the street corners as the drivers of other vehicles leaned out of their car windows : " Anyone hurt ? " one woman asked . " Does n't appear so , " a male voice answered , " but I 'm gon na be late , thanks to these idiots .... " Good grief , Cammi thought . As if her reasons for coming home were n't bad enough , now she 'd have to add " caused a car crash , smack-dab in the middle of town " to the already too-long list . Suddenly , she felt light-headed and grabbed the gnarled fender of the cowboy 's pickup for support . He waved back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two strong hands gripping her upper arms . Crouching slightly , he squinted and stared into her eyes . " You okay ? Should I call 911 ? " The dizziness passed as quickly as it had descended . Cammi shook her head . " No . I 'm okay . " And to prove it , she stepped away from his truck and smiled . He thumbed his Stetson to the back of his head and looked her over from head to toe . Satisfied Cammi was indeed all right , he nodded and crossed both arms over his chest . " Did you even see that red light ? " Blinking as the cold October rain sheeted down her cheeks , she stared , slack-jawed and silent , as her gaze slid from his dark , frowning eyebrows to his full-lipped , scolding mouth . Not a bump or bruise , Cammi noted , not so much as a split lip . Thank God for that ! " I - I 'm sorry . I do n't know what was ... " He ignored her just as surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath , he began pacing circles around what was left of their vehicles . " Is she blind ? " he said , throwing both hands into the air . " Where 'd she get her driver 's license , in a bubble gum machine ? " Unlike her sisters and so many of her friends , Cammi had earned her license on the first try , and had n't been involved in so much as a fender bender since . " I can see perfectly well , thank you , " she snapped , " and there is n't a thing wrong with my hearing , either . " He looked up suddenly . Scrubbing both hands over his face , he expelled a deep sigh , then slid a cell phone from his jacket pocket . " Well , " he said , flipping it open and punching the keys with his forefinger , " at least you 're not hurt . " Frowning , he gave her a second once-over . If Cammi did n't know better , she 'd have to say he looked downright concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for that brief dizzy spell . - and Cammi thought she knew what was to blame for that - she 'd come through the accident unharmed . A quick nod was her answer . Facing the intersection , he spoke quietly into the phone , shaking his head . He reminded her a bit of her father , what with his frustrated gestures and matter-of-fact reporting of the facts . He probably outweighed her dad by twenty pounds , all of it muscle , she decided , remembering the way his strong hands had steadied her moments earlier . The similarities made Cammi swallow , hard , knowing that the reprimand this cowboy gave her would pale when compared to the look of disapproval she 'd see in her father 's eyes once she got home . It would 've been tough enough , bringing him up to speed on the reasons she 'd left L.A. - without this mess . Especially one so similar to the wreck that killed her mother . Especially considering that in his mind , this too , like so many other things , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only thing that stood between her and tears . But there 'd be plenty of time for self-pity later , after she 'd told her father about Rusty , about the - " Tow trucks are on the way , " he said , interrupting her reverie . He snapped his phone shut , dropped it back into his pocket . " You look a little green around the gills , " he added , wrapping those big fingers around her upper arm yet again . " Soakin ' wet , too , " he continued , leading her toward Georgia 's Diner . And in a voice she could n't describe as anything but tender , he added , " What-say you wait inside , where it 's warm and dry , while I take care of things out here . " She hated to admit it , but she did feel a bit dazed and confused . Why else would she have so quickly and willingly followed his instructions ? As he reached for the door handle , Cammi considered the possibility that he was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet as honey the next . What if he 'd just robbed a bank , and the accident had interfered with his getaway ? He held the door open and smiled . " Order me a cup of coffee , will ya ? " He nodded toward the intersection . " I have a feeling I 'm gon na need it once that mess is cleaned up . " ( Continues ... )
