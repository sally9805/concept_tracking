<p> In response to the latest youth violence in Michigan , President Clinton asks from his bully pulpit : " If we have the technology today to put in these child safety locks , why do n't we do it ? " How typically facile of him . I propose a different question : " When will Americans begin to dissect and reject the easy answers of amoral politicians who foremost promote themselves at the expense of a better America ? " Who truly believes that a household willing to keep a stolen weapon will be chastened into lawfulness by another , less punitive law that requires gun locks ? <p> The cure for our festering pathology of youth violence will remain forever undiscovered until a courageously honest leader occupies the White House and reintroduces the concept of assigning blame to the adults guilty of failing in their responsibility to children , rather than to the guns , or " the rich , " or racism , sexism , capitalism , and the shredded remaining vestiges of the Second Amendment . <p> Only when long-lost social stigmas begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegitimacy , single parenthood and day care take on a proper sense of shame and humiliation , akin to that of Hawthorne 's scarlet letter . Only then will the damage wrought by such choices be stemmed . <p> A drop of moral leadership will do far more for America than the continued flood of ill-conceived and constitutionally questionable legislation that jerks the knees of an addle-brained electorate that can discourse little on our foundational ideals and liberties but can fill a notebook with details about " Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire ? " <p> Americans need a slap in the face and a kick in the pants , and I volunteer to head the line to vote for the first candidate who takes his wet finger out of the wind . <p> Anthony Louis Troyke , Berwyn <p> Real genius <p> There has been increasing emphasis on the idea that there are " smart guns " and " stupid guns , " where smart guns can be used only by their rightful owners while stupid guns can be used by anyone . <p> Congress could save many lives by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from themselves and intelligent people from the stupid criminals or psychopaths wielding stupid guns . <p> Such an act would transform the National Rifle Association from a stupid gun club into an intelligent gun club , and restore Charlton Heston to his rightful role as a charismatic hero . <p> Since it is a foregone conclusion that stupid guns eventually will be eliminated , why not hasten the day by outlawing them now ? <p> Kenneth J. Epstein , Edgewater <p> Gentrification blues <p> As a longtime resident of the Six Corners area ( on the Northwest Side ) , I have seen many changes , welcoming those sorely needed such as Jewel/Osco and a new Walgreens . <p> However , I am greatly dismayed that affordable and accessible housing has been ignored , along with senior citizens , the disabled and low-income people . <p> It 's nice that they 're building new homes in the Six Corners area , but at $ 233,000 to $ 340,000 a pop and resales at up to $ 400,000 , who can afford them ? And what 's supposed to happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not  --  and that 's not in the Six Corners area alone . This is repeated throughout the city . <p> If Six Corners is to truly re-awaken , it needs to have a seniors ' apartment building , accessible housing for the disabled and affordable housing for low-income people . Last time I looked , their money  --  although not much of it  --  is spent in local stores . <p> Six Corners ( and other areas ) must have a blend of all different people to survive  --  not just one class . Somebody wake up . <p> Nancy Buckley , Portage Park <p> Unleash the watchdog <p> The Legislature has begun rewriting the state 's Telecommunications Act . Illinois consumer groups will be advocating an open process built upon the basic consumer right of choice and improved service promoted through competition . We hope this process does not turn into a repeat of what happened in the electric utility deregulation debate , where a handful of special-interest groups traded in secret . <p> The political clout of the telecommunications industry in Illinois will continue to be a formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giver to the Illinois Legislature : more than $ 600,000 between 1997 and 1999 . We can expect that number to grow even larger with Ameritech 's merger with SBC . <p> This merger is one that needs vigilant scrutiny . It is outrageous that only a few months into the new merger consumers already are feeling the burden of higher local telephone costs . Clearly , Illinois consumers have not yet reaped any benefits from this mega-merger . A result of this rewrite process must be that the Illinois Commerce Commission maintains authority to enforce its orders . A weakened ICC will not benefit consumers in this already volatile industry in Illinois . <p> Lynda DeLaforgue , <p> co-director , <p> Citizen Action/Illinois <p> Spring cleaning time <p> I am both dismayed and annoyed with the professional conduct of Gov . Ryan , whose indifference to his duties as secretary of state sullied the reputation of Illinois . He joins the ranks of other embarrassing state officers , including Auditor Orville Hodge , who stole money with a No. 2 pencil ; former Secretary of State Paul Powell , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto Kerner , who extorted money from Marge Everett at the Arlington racetrack , and former Gov . Dan Walker , who used a federally insured savings and loan as his personal piggy bank . <p> While there is no evidence that Ryan benefitted personally , the widespread sale of commercial driver 's licenses to unqualified applicants places in jeopardy the safety of all drivers in Illinois and throughout the country . The number of indictments , convictions and offices involved hurts Illinois ' business climate and is an affront to every voter . <p> Ryan 's resignation would give Illinois a fresh start . <p> Donald D. Jacobsen , Loop <p> No more dinky rinks <p> Regarding the news story " Ban urged on checking in kids hockey " ( March 7 ) : One detail that continues to be overlooked is that the hockey ice surface is far too small . <p> I coach an all-star team in Winnetka , and just could n't believe how poor the officiating was last season . I also coach two other teams in Winnetka , including a Squirt Girls Allstar team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drove to Madison to see the Badgers ' women 's team play their first game against Harvard , the defending champions . Two important things about that game : no checking , and Olympic-size ice surface that made the game faster . <p> ( On a larger ice surface , New Trier hockey ) Neal Goss never would have been paralyzed because the baseboard that his chin hit would have been set back further , and he would have slowed down before contact with the boards . Would n't fans like to see more passing , skating , goals ? <p> It makes sense to increase the rink size and educate the officials with better and more training . <p> David McGowan , Deerfield <p> A bottom-line world <p> In his letter ( March 7 ) casting doubt on concerns about global warming , Bill McGann says it would be ludicrous to think that industry knowingly would destroy the environment and , in so doing , diminish future business opportunities . It is not necessary to believe that businessmen are evil to foresee them doing just that . <p> Assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company must spend money now to preserve the quality of life for people who are not yet born . Sounds like a very hard sell , but if he did succeed , how long do you think he would be around when it became apparent that less socially conscious competitors were not following suit ? <p> Although there are still uncertainties about the extent and consequences of global warming , people who expect such problems to be solved by market forces do n't know how markets work . <p> Thomas W. Evans , Mundelein <p> Distasteful but free <p> Ald. Edward Burke is proposing an ordinance to ban legal , informational picketing outside funeral homes . While I agree that the Teamsters picketing may be insensitive , the free speech rights of unions are protected by our Constitution , just as everyone else 's are . <p> The Teamsters have a right to inform people of their grievances , as this issue affects the livelihood of working people . It is only natural that they would set up their pickets when people are present  --  that 's the point . Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because his ordinance will be struck down upon judicial review . <p> Legal protest is protected under our system . To make exceptions is to begin the path to a police state . <p> Mike Barnes , Inverness <p> A surfeit of nostalgia <p> I am planning a trip this summer . I 'll be driving a car that goes three times as far on a gallon of gas as the pig I was driving in 1970 did . If gas prices hit $ 2 a gallon , allowing for inflation and the triple fuel economy , the trip will cost about the same as it did 30 years ago . <p> Charles R. Stevenson , <p> Schaumburg
