Chapter One A Little Piece of History Stuck to the heavy oak door was a fluorescent green Post-it Note upon which Pip 's mother had written Daughter 's Room with a broad blue felt-tip marker . Down the passageway , Pip could see other notes on other doors - Son 's Room , Master Bedroom , Guest Room 1 and Bathroom . Each one stood out in the semi-darkness , she thought , like a glowing , square green eye . Lifting the iron latch , Pip stepped into her new bedroom . Compared to her last , it was huge , at least four meters square , with ancient mullioned windows set in sandstone . Two of the walls were lined with dark oak panels , and the ceiling was held up by massive wooden beams as black as if they had been charred in a fire . The floorboards were each of different widths , according to where they had been cut from the trunk of the tree . As she walked to the windows , they creaked . " Well , what do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father was standing in the doorway . " It 's ... " Momentarily , she was lost for words . " Is this a pretty spectacular house , or what ? " her father said for her . " And this , " he looked around the empty room , " is a really stupendous bedroom . " Pip grinned.Spectacular was one of her father 's favorite adjectives . Stupendous was the other . " Your last one , " her father continued , " was a rabbit hutch by comparison . " He came to her side and gazed out of the window . " And to think that view 's hardly changed in the last five hundred years . There 's not a single tree out there that has n't got a preservation order on it . I ca n't so much as prune a twig without local council permission . " Following his gaze , Pip took in the neat garden with its trim flowerbeds , smooth lawn and an ancient mulberry tree in the center , the curve of the gravel drive , down the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture beyond with massive oak , elm and beech trees dotted about it . Farther off still was a river lined with pollarded willows . " Once , the house was moated , " her father went on . " See beyond the edge of the garden , where the ground dips ? That was it . But in the eighteenth century , it was mostly filled in to make a ha-ha . " Pip , who was never quite sure when her father was being serious , gave him one of her disparaging looks and sarcastically replied , " Ha ! Ha ! " " Really , " he said , briefly pretending to be hurt . " It was a landscaping feature . A ha-ha is a grassy ditch , surrounding a house , that slopes down gently towards the building , but has a stone wall on the house side . The idea was to keep animals out of the gardens without a fence or hedge spoiling the view . " He turned from the window and walked over to the door . " Your mother 's put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After he had gone , Pip unfolded the estate agent 's leaflet she had in her pocket and , not for the first time that day , read the blurb printed on the front page beneath a color photo of the front elevation of the house . Rawne Barton , she read , situated in beautiful countryside three miles from the pretty market town of Brampton , offers a rare opportunity to purchase a Grade I-listed , landedgentleman 's country house set in thirty-two acres of pasture , formerly a deer park . Originally built in 1422 , but extended over the following hundred years , the property comprises a spacious and superbly appointed six-bedroom family house with extensive period features including contemporary linen-fold paneling , beamed ceilings with carved features and magnificent fireplaces . Recent extensive modernization has been conducted to the highest standards and in complete keeping with the architectural and historical aspects of the house . A range of contemporary outbuildings includes a stable ( restored and providing ample space for vehicles ) , a coach house and a malt-house ( both in need of renovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building made partly of white wattle-and-daub and partly of brick with black timber beams built into the walls . Above the tiled roof stood two stacks of chimneys , added in the sixteenth century , made of the same sandstone as the window frames , but twisted in spirals like sticks of old-fashioned barley sugar . " Do you know what barton means ? " Pip looked around to see her twin brother , Tim . The knees of his jeans were grimy , his T-shirt was smudged with dirt and his brown hair looked as if it had been lightly powdered with flour . " Try knocking , " she said sharply . " Door 's already open , " Tim responded , " and I 'm not coming in . " He slid to the floor , leaning against the doorpost . " It means a cow shed , " he went on . " No , it does n't , " Pip corrected him . " It means a farm owned by a landowner , not given to tenants . I looked it up . " She ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you so grubby ? " Tim ignored her question . " And you know what Grade I-listed means , do n't you ? " he continued . " It means we ca n't put up a satellite dish . Goodbye MTV and the Cartoon Channel . " " We can have one of those square ones in the attic , " Pip said . " Grade I only means you ca n't alter the appearance of the house or destroy any historical features . " " They do n't get such a good signal , " Tim rejoined . " Besides , I 've seen the attic . No chance . The rest of the house might have been modernized , but that has n't . The cobwebs are like table-tennis nets . " " You 've been up there ? " " There 's a door at the end of the passage , " Tim said . " I thought it was an airing cupboard , because it 's got shelves and a copper water cylinder in it , but at the back there 's an old paneled wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a bit of a squeeze , which is probably why the builders did n't bother to go up there . Behind that , there 're steps . The attic floor 's boarded , but there are n't any rooms or anything , just a big space with a little window at the end and a lot of beams , crud and cobwebs . And a dried-up dead bat . " One of the removal men appeared at the door carrying a large cardboard box with yet another Post-it Note taped to it . " You the daughter ? " he asked . " This your room ? " He did n't wait for an answer but , checking the Post-it Note on the door against that on the box , entered , stepping over Tim and looking around . " Nice . Very nice . Quite a place your mum and dad 've bought . " He put the box down and glanced out of the window . " You know what you got here , do n't you ? You got a real little piece of history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
