<p> The gleaming glass double doors of the just-opened Remde Spa in downtown 's brand-new , ultra-swanky St. Regis Hotel do more than just transport guests into another relaxing oasis in town  --  they also represent the crossing of yet another threshold in the city 's luxury spa offerings . <p> With interiors in calming creams and clean whites , the spa occupies 9,000 square feet on the fifth and sixth floors of the elegantly appointed 40-story hotel that sits next to the Museum of Modern Art on Third Street . On the other side of the museum sits the W Hotel ( also owned by the Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. ) , which opened a Bliss Spa last July . <p> In the span of four months , that one block alone has gotten 14,000 square feet of spa space , saunas , steam rooms and other slick amenities . <p> Within a five-block radius , Remde is now the 25th spa to open where just seven stood back in 1998 , said spa director Laura Krohn . That kind of dramatic increase is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association there were 1,662 hotel or resort spas operating in 2004 , compared with 473 in 2000 . <p> As the numbers ( and physical sizes ) of the spas increase , so too does the list of extravagant services . <p> " We 've come a long way since , ' Calgon ... take me away , ' where escape was as simple as a soothing bath , " said Erik Rosegard , an associate professor of recreation and leisure studies at San Francisco State University . " Now a simple seaweed wrap will not suffice unless the body treatment is followed by an aromatherapy salt glow and cooling aloe spritzer . Of course , the seaweed , salt and aloe must be organic and imported from a remote location frequented by Angelina Jolie . " <p> Just like theme parks and movies , spas must constantly scale new heights to capture customers ' attention , he said , but people tend to become desensitized quickly , resulting in a cycle of ever grander offerings to recapture the public 's fascination . <p> To that end , Remde Spa has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slabs , a yoga studio and other rooms with darkly stained , striated Zebrano wood and steam room and whirlpool area with walls coated with thousands of 1-inch iridescent , mother-of-pearl-like tiles . Real cashmere throws cover the treatment tables , and guests sip free sparkling wine and nibble chocolate truffles while awaiting services like the $130 hourlong Sweep Body Softening Scrub , which uses a white marble exfoliating powder from the spa 's signature French and Swedish-designed product line , Laboratoire Remde . <p> " It 's completely different from anything available currently , " said Krohn , repeating an oft-heard mantra among spa professionals . " It 's our nuances , like not having sinks in the treatment rooms so people do n't have to be disturbed by the sound of water running , that make us special . " ( It is certainly very different from the much smaller Remde Day Spa that formerly existed along the Sausalito waterfront  --  the company bought the name in 2004 from the local owner before opening Remde spas in St. Regis hotels in Aspen and New York earlier this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing the landscape of San Francisco from a land of smaller , specialty spas into a mega-spa metropolis . <p> Construction is under way on SenSpa , a $4 million East-meets-West holistic spa and wellness center that is set to open next April in a converted 13,000-square-foot warehouse in the Presidio  --  which its owners say will make it the largest space of its kind in the city . <p> " We 'll have Eastern-based massage , bodywork , nutrition counseling , as well as offering holistic medicinal and herb-based treatments that combine time-honored healing traditions of the East blended with the scientific advancements of the West , " said Randy Schreck , SenSpa 's president and general manager . In addition to herb-based facials and massages , the spa plans to offer a wide array of exercise programs and hikes around the surrounding areas that capitalize on the locations and vistas that have made the former Army base so famous . Afterward , participants will be able to return to the grounds  --  tucked away behind the new Lucasfilm 's Letterman Digital Arts Center  --  in a modern tea garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is to replicate the magic and magnitude found at premier destination spas like Arizona 's Canyon Ranch and Esperanza in Cabo San Lucas , Mexico , Schreck said . <p> " There are so many people that live here that go away once a year and go detox and do yoga and work out , and they commit to themselves while they are down there that they will keep eating right and doing all those things when they come back , " he said . " But there 's no one single place to go to incorporate all those places into their daily life on an ongoing basis , so we feel there 's a real market for this . " <p> In another nod to a desire to keep things as pure as humanly possible , Schreck said the spa plans to pipe filtered water into all the faucets  --  " at significant expense "  --  so that whether the water is sipped or squeezed onto a towel during a facial , it is as free of pollutants as possible . <p> Schreck , formerly vice president of Spa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's best-known spas and counts an array of celebrities and the city 's social elite among its most loyal clients , said he could n't resist pursuing the holistic health center concept , which he sees as being the future of the spa industry . <p> " I think that many spas focus on fixing things from the outside , " he said , " but what many people are starting to realize is that everything that 's on your inside comes to the outside , so eating right and health and well-being is everything . " <p> Angelina Umansky , who has co-owned Spa Radiance with her mother , Galina Rovner , during more than 25 years , three locations and a name change , said she is not fearful of the increasing number of larger hotel and specialty spas opening their doors . <p> That 's because fully 90 percent of her clients are regular , repeat customers , she said , and she does n't even advertise in publications catering to tourists  --  on which so many hotel spas rely for the majority of their bookings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one-time birthday treatment , it 's a relationship , " said Umansky , who said her schedule is typically fully booked months in advance . " I 've had one client who 's been coming for 25 years , we 've been pregnant together , been through divorces together , they are like my family . " <p> She also prides herself on continually creating novel treatments like the Chocolate Paprika facial ( $200 ) and body treatment ( $140 ) unveiled last month . The fiery spice rejuvenates dull or tired skin , Umansky said , and because she knows her clients ' skin so well , she knows whose skin is too sensitive and whose will benefit best from the boost . <p> Nob Hill Spa at the Huntington Hotel also boasts a high rate of repeat , local visitors  --  as many as 80 percent of the clients . A large number are drawn to the spa 's popular program that allows local dwellers to purchase day visits for $35 ( or 10 visits for $275 ) that allow them unlimited use of the infinity pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yoga studio on Mondays through Thursdays , said spokeswoman Devon Beddard . <p> The spa is finishing plans to expand beyond its current 11,000 square feet and open another location in the hotel in the near future because of the spa 's popularity with bridal parties and groups of girlfriends who want to receive treatments simultaneously . <p> So how long can the spa boom  --  long fueled by a general increase in health consciousness and plentiful options  --  continue to thrive ? Is the lovely soap-scented bubble destined to burst if there is too much of a good thing ? <p> Craig Fossella , the former global spa director of Bliss who left in 2003 and is now manager of Tru , a spa in the Financial District , is one of those who said it seems that the supply of spas is starting to outpace demand . Even so , smaller , savvier locations could have the advantage over hotel behemoth spas if they can keep their cachet and offer consistently high quality . <p> " Travelers are more and more sophisticated , so all these hotels having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enough , " he said . " It 's much as with restaurants  --  most people do n't go to a hotel restaurant just because there 's food there . <p> " What people want now is to come for two hours , and they want whatever they do to be effective , " he said . " They do n't want to sit for hours and hours on end or be pampered as much as they want a facial to get their skin as good as it can be . " <p> His strategy at Tru has been to offer unique experiences like the " Rainforest Room "  --  where steam fills a room carved out of real rock , and then warm water showers from the ceiling in a simulated waterfall  --  a concept that 's won raves in publications ranging from Forbes to W. <p> Fossella said he 's confident about Tru 's future success and continuing client loyalty , but added that newer , more competitive spas coming on the scene could make things quite stressful for owners of smaller , older spas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different to offer , " he said , " may be pretty much blown out of the water .
