More We went to the playground court to find our missing fathers . We did nt find them but we found a game and the game served us as a daddy of sorts . We formed families of men and boys , male clans ruled and disciplined by the games demands , its hard , distant , implacable gaze , its rare , maybe loving embrace of us : the game taught us to respect it and respect ourselves and other players . Playing the game provided sanctuary , refuge from a hostile world , and also toughened us by instructing us in styles for coping with that world . Only trouble was , to reach the court we had left our women behind . Even though wed found the game and it allowed us , if not to become our own fathers , at least to glimpse their faces , hear their voices , the family wed run away from home to restore would remain broken until we returned to share the tales of our wandering , listen to the women tell theirs . No book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a game Ive played for most of my life , the game of playground basketball I love and now must stop playing . At fifty-nine Im well past the age most people would consider the natural , inevitable time to give up whats clearly a young persons sport . According to this conventional wisdom Ive been stealing for years , decades , stretching unreasonably my time on the court , lacing on sneakers , abusing my body , running up and down as if it never has to end . My three kids are grown and I have a granddaughter in North Carolina old enough to chatter with me on the phone and as I write these words a horrifically bloody century has just ended , my marriage of thirty-plus years has unraveled , and each morning my body requires more coaxing , more warming up to maneuver through the thicket of old aches and pains that settle in during sleep . Still , for some reason basketball feels important . Im not giving it up willingly . I dream about it . Im devoting passion and energy to writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , because for me whats more important than any product this project achieves is for the process to feel something like playing the game I cant let go . So this writing is for me , first . A way of holding on . Letting go . Starting a story so a story can end . Telling playground basketball stories , and if I tell them well they will be more about basketball than about me . Because the game rules . The game will assert its primacy . I need the game more than it needs me . You learn that simple truth as a neophyte , an unskilled beginner enthralled , intimidated by the unlikely prospect that youll ever become as good as those you watch . Learn this truth again , differently , the same truth and a different truth as a veteran observing the action you can barely keep up with anymore and shouldnt even be trying to keep up with anymore . You play for yourself , but the games never for you or about you . Even at your best , in those charmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whats going to happen next will be exactly what you want to happen , not maybe or wishing or hoping , just the thrill coursing through your body of being in the flow , in synch , no fear of missing or losing or falling out of time even in those split seconds which are one form of grace the game delivers , the game is larger than you , its simply permitting you to experience a glimmer , a shimmer of how large it is , how just a smidgen of it can fill you almost to bursting . When you were born the game was here waiting , and the beat will go on without you . I think of this game and see my first son , Dan , best ten-year- old free-throw shooter in Wyoming , slowly bowing his head , his knees nearly buckling , eyes filling with tears , looking suddenly so tiny out there alone on the foul line in a cavernous Nebraska high school gym when he realizes his best is not going to be good enough that particular day to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at thirteen sinking two sweet , all-net jumpers in a row from the corner to win a tough , tight pickup game in the university gym when finally both my sons are old enough to hold their own and play with me on the same team against college kids . See their sister , my daughter , Jamila , leading her Stanford University womens team , number one in the country , into an arena packed with 14,000 fans , a huge roar of rooting for and against them greeting her and her teammates as they trot onto the court , then the eerie quiet two and a half hours later , two and a half hours of some of the most riveting hoop Ive ever watched , as Jamila , totally exhausted , collapses into her mothers arms after performing heroically and losing in overtime her final college game . Whatever you make of this book , I need it . Need it the way Ive needed the playground game . Need it like I needed this rain softly falling now , finally , after a whole day so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark in expectation of the first large , cooling drops . A sweltering June day I climbed a steep trail up a mountain and hiked through woods surrounding two small reservoirs where people skinny-dip and sunbathe naked , as if the summer of love never ended . Rain in the air , in the sky , on my mind all day . Gray heaps of clouds drifting in , gradually trumping whats been mainly blue . Then the sky scrubs itself stark blue again . The threat of rain never going away , however , even in the brightest streaming down of sunshine , and I cant stop needing it , daydreaming cool rain breaking through . Need to write something like a book because last week back home in Pittsburgh , in the morning I visited my brother Robby whos serving a life term in Western Penitentiary and in the afternoon of the same day visited in a VA hospital the body of my father whose mind has been erased by the disease Robby and the other prisoners call old-timers . Need it in this season of losses , losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dues paid and dues still to pay heavy on my mind , never far from my thoughts whatever else I might find myself doing in this transitional time , season to season , epoch to epoch , century to century , young to old , life to dying , giving up things , losing things I never believed Id have to relinquish . Playground basketball only a game . Why , given my constant struggling and juggling to fit a busy schedule into days without enough hours , does basketball sit there , above the fray , a true and unblemished exception to the rules , the countless hours committed to it unregretted . Why was basketball untouchable over the years as I devised and revised blueprints for making the most profitable use of my time . Why am I missing the playground game , yearning for it now even before it quite slips away . Why when I know good and well its time to stop play- ing hoop , time to reconcile myself to the idea of moving on , why do I continue to treat these ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this break from the game cant be final . If Im patient , hang around , give myself a little time to heal , to get right , Ill be back out on the court again , wont I. If I knew the answers , I probably wouldnt need to write the book , or the something like a book Im pushing for , would settle for , anxious it may be less but also hoping for more than a book . No answers sought here . No book . My need enough . My desire to lose myself in doing something like playing the game . Growing up , I needed basketball because my family was poor and colored , hemmed in by material circumstances none of us knew how to control , and if I wanted more , a larger , different portion than other poor colored folks in Homewood , I had to single myself out . I say if I wanted more because if was a real question , a stumbling block many kids in Homewood couldnt get past . Its probably accurate to say that anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire . How long does it last . What forms does it take . How many young people are convinced they deserve more or believe they possess the strength required to obtain more or believe they actually have a chance for more . The idea of race and the practice of racism in our country work against African-American kids forming and sustaining belief in themselves . Wanting more does nt teach you there are ways to get there . Nor does it create the self-image of a deserving recipient , a worthwhile person worth striving for . You need the plausibility , the possibility of imagining a different life for yourself , other than the meager portion doled out by the imperatives of race and racism , the negative prospects impressed continuously upon a black kids consciousness , stifling , stunting the self- awareness of far too many . Including black kids not poor . Imagining a different portion is the first step , the door cracking between known and unknown . A door on alternative possibilities . If you want more and youre lucky enough , as I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may then begin to forge a game plan . If you believe youre in the game , you may be willing to learn the games ABCs . Learn what it costs to play . Begin making yourself a player . I figured out early that hard , solo work the only way to get certain things about hoop right . Every chance I got I practiced alone the shooting , dribbling skills other kids had somehow mastered . Fear part of it . Fear of failure . Of humiliation . Love just as important as fear . Unconditional love from my family . A sense someone cared , someone rooted for me , someone expected me to do well . I did nt want to let those folks down nor behave on the court in a fashion they might be ashamed of . If I wanted more , I must risk failing , and it helped immeasurably to know that somebody somewhere supported my effort to play well . Would support me if I did nt play well . If no one cared , why bother . Why beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me imagine I possessed the power to invent myself , make more of myself , become a player . Fear and love , love and fear raised the stakes of the game . Engendered the beginnings of a hunger , the hunger driving the serious players I admire most , who never seem satisfied no matter how well they perform , players who consistently push themselves as if more hustle , more speed , more brawling competitiveness is never too much . Players who refuse to settle into a comfort zone , who wont accept limits , who attack the game with the same unstinting voraciousness as the game when it attacks them , consuming the best of their bodies and spirits . The pampering and privileges I received because I was male and the oldest child in the various households of our extended clan certified love in abundance and also stimulated my desire for more . The slightly larger share my mother sometimes tried to slip me when she divided a cake or pie under the hawk eyes of my siblings I took not only as a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny bit extra also reinforced a sense of entitlement . Without exactly knowing it , I was beginning to single myself out , practicing in the interior world of daydream and fantasy , where no one could eavesdrop , how it might feel to exercise power and authority , fire and a voice I had almost no reason to anticipate my material circumstances colored and poor in Homewood would ever grant me . Growing up in a world where adults heaped love on kids in any and every fashion they could manage , the women lavishing daily , close- up care and attention , the men leaving the house at dawn to line up on the corner where work might or might not arrive , men gone from can to caint , splicing multiple , piecemeal jobs into a precarious living wage , where delicious meals were scraped together from cheap cuts beaten and boiled to tenderness , from government-surplus cheese , powdered milk , and canned , ground , jellied , mystery meat , from chickens feet , necks , gizzards , beef neckbones , pigs feet , a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year at Christmas , the holiday when grownups spent themselves silly , diving deeper , more hopelessly into debt as if one morning of glittering extravagance could erase all the empty-handed ones , in this world of abrupt change , boom and bust , feast and famine where love on one hand acted as a steadying , stabilizing force and on the other hand could exert no control whatsoever over the oppressive economic environment in which both kids and adults were trapped , without that love I would have been a lost soul , but love also created a desperate hunger for more , far more than the people who loved me could provide . Love bred a dark fear of its absence . Because if love disappeared , what would remain . Wouldnt the point be I did nt measure up , did nt deserve love . As a kid , did I think about my life in terms of wanting more . More of what . Where would I find it . Did I actually pose similar questions to myself . When . How . Why . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger for the game , and not too sure of much else . The act of looking back , the action of writing down what I think I see/saw , destroys certainty . The past presents itself fluidly , changeably , at least as much a work in progress as the present or future . No scorebook . No reliable witnesses or too many witnesses . Too much time . No time . One beauty of playground hoop is how relentlessly , scrupulously it encloses and defines moments . Playing the game well requires all your attention . When youre working to stay in the game , the game works to keep you there . None of the minds subtle , complex operations are shut down when you play , theyre just intently harnessed , focused to serve the games complex demands . In the heat of the game you may conceive of yourself playing the game , an aspect of yourself watching another aspect perform , but the speed of the game , its continuous go and flow , does nt allow a player to indulge this conscious splitting-off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever advantages such self-division confers are swiftly overridden when youre playing hoop by the compelling necessity to be , to be acutely alert to what youre experiencing as play , the consuming reality of the games immediate demands . You are the experience . Or it thumps you in the face like a teammates pass you werent expecting when you should have been expecting . Writing autobiography , looking back , trying to recall and represent yourself at some point in the past , you are playing many games simultaneously . There are many selves , many sets of rules jostling for position . None offers the clarifying , cleansing unity of playing hoop . The ball court provides a frame , boundaries , the fun and challenge of call and response that forces you to concentrate your boundless energy within a defined yet seemingly unlimited space . The past is not forgotten when you walk onto the court to play . It lives in the Great Time of the games flow , incorporating past present and future , time passing as you work to bring to bear all youve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioned responses , experience accumulated from however many years youve played and watched the game played , a past thats irrelevant baggage unless you can access it instantaneously . Second thoughts useless . Opportunities knock once . And if you think about missing the previous shot when youre attempting the next one , most likely youll miss it , too . And on and on , you lose , until , unless you get your head back into the game . Into whats next and next and next . The past is crucial , though not in the usual sense . Means everything or nothing depending on how its employed and how you should employ it strictly , ruthlessly dictated by the flow , the moment . Yes . You can sit back and ponder your performance later , learn from your mistakes , maybe , or spin good stories and shapeshift mistakes into spectacular plays , but none of thats playing ball . If playground hoop is about the once and only go and flow of time , its unbroken continuity , about times thick , immersing , perpetual presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing , often antagonistic voices within the writer , voices with separate agendas , voices occupying discrete , unbridgeable islands of time and space . Writing , whether it settles into a traditional formulaic set of conventions to govern the relationship between writer and reader or experiments with these borders , relies on some mode of narrative sequencing or " story line " to function as the games spine of action functions to keep everybodys attention through a linear duration of time . The problem for writers is that story must be invented anew for each narrative . A story interesting to one person may bore another . Writing describes ball games the reader can never be sure anybody has ever played . The only access to them is through the writers creation . You cant go there or know there , just accept someones words they exist . While playing the game is everything in playground hoop , in writing , if there ever was a game , its finished before the reader arrives . The written text happens only after the action it describes , real action or imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story begins . The writer may be dead too , even though the text also and always enacts itself in a timeless , eternally present tense of composition . Pity the poor writer . He or shes a benchwarmer , a kind of made-up spectator who may or not be spectating the game in front of his face , or other games , other places , other times , or a mixture of the actual , of memory , wishes , dreams of game , a fictitious fan like those created in press releases by promoters who claim the arenas empty stands are full of adoring , paying customers so other paying customers will be attracted . Though the writer seems to be in charge , he s more like a coach who cant insert himself in the lineup . The closest he can come to the action is sending in a substitute for himself and reflecting the action from the subs point of view . He can lend the sub his uniform , name , number , but the writer remains stuck on the pine . In the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local radio stations would receive a tickertape summary of a baseball game occurring far away in a major league city . Based on the tapes skeletal account , the announcer ( President Ronald Reagan labored as this kind of fabulator ) would narrate the game to his listening audience as if he were sitting behind home plate , observing play by play what he was saying . Depending on the announcers skill ( deception ) in manufacturing details , filling in background , elaborating in a colorful , dramatic fashion on the bare-bones info of a scanty script , the fiction of a ball game would become satisfyingly real or not for listeners . The writers voice , like the voice of this remote , radio , play-by-play announcer , pitches itself to the reader from a site distanced from the action words describe by many kinds of distance , many kinds of remove , many layers of art and artifice , illusion and lies that also keep the reader at a distance , multiple removes from the action , many forms of remove the reader can choose to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true or false , is the tale-teller reliable , am I listening to a real person or a made-up person pretending to be a person , etc. , etc. ) , but removes always there , built into the circumstances , conditioned by the nature of narrative construction . Heres the paradox : hoop frees you to play by putting you into a real cage . Writing cages the writer with the illusion of freedom . Playing ball , you submit for a time to certain narrow arbitrary rules , certain circumscribed choices . But once in , theres no script , no narrative line you must follow . Writing lets you imagine youre outside time , freely generating rules and choices , but as you tell your story youre bound tighter and tighter , word by word , following the script you narrate . No logical reason a playground game cant go on forever . In a sense thats exactly what Great Time , the vast , all-encompassing ocean of nonlinear time , allows the game to do . A piece of writing without the unfolding drama of closure promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on forever , and probably loses its audience at that point . Fortunately , graciously , the unpredictability of language , its stubborn self-referentiality , its mysterious capacity to mutate , assert a will of its own no matter how hard you struggle to enslave it , bend it , coerce it to express your bidding , language , with its shadowy , imminent resources and magical emergent properties , sometimes approximates a hoop games freedom . The writer feels what its like to be a player when the medium rules , when its constraints are also a free ride to unforeseen , unexpected , surprising destinations , to breaks and zones offering the chance to do something , be somebody , somewhere , somehow new . As if the tape the remote baseball announcer depends upon suddenly stops transmitting and he improvises a home-run riff to fill dead air , then discovers when the tape resumes ticking that some batter has knocked a ball out of the park . Given all the above , I still want more from writing . More than a sense of being stuck on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeated , slump- shouldered dejection of seeing my team lose a game before I get a chance to enter it . Not because I expect more from writing , I just need more . Want to share the immediate excitement of process , of invention , of play . ( Maybe thats why I teach writing . ) Need more in the same way I needed more as I was growing up in Homewood . Let me be clear . The more Im talking about then and now is not simply an extra slice of pie or cake . Seeking more means self-discovery . Means redefining the art I practice . In the present instance , wanting to compose and share a piece of writing that wont fail because it might not fit someone elses notion of what a book should be . One of the worst trials for Americans of visible African descent ( and maybe for invisible crossovers too ) is the perpetual fear of not measuring up to standards established by so-called white people who imagine themselves the standard issue and also presume themselves to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have every reason to know better , by deep-seated anxieties are we doomed because we are not these " white " other people , are we fated , because we are who we are , never to be good enough . I need writing because it can extend the measure of whats possible , allow me to engage in defining standards . In my chosen field I can strive to accomplish what Michael Jordan has achieved in playing hoop become a standard for others to measure themselves against . So playground basketball and writing , alike and unlike , both start there ways to single myself out . Seeking qualities in myself worth saving , something others might appreciate and reward , qualities , above all , I can count on to prove a point to myself , to change myself for better or worse . Hoop and writing may result in the most basic sort of self-knowledge , but none of thats guaranteed . Theyre about the seeking , the inquiry , process not destination . Hoop and writing intrigue me because no matter how many answers I articulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep asking the same questions . Is anybody home in there . Who . If I take a chance and turn the sucker out , will he be worth a hot damn , worth the trouble . Or shame me . Embarrass me . Or represent . Shine forth . But before basketball and writing came music . All music but especially music performed by people who sounded like me , like the voices of Homewood . Music informing me how much more there was to being a black boy growing up than Id ever have suspected without musics intimations . Music carved space . Music spoke a language of emotion , literally moved me , excited my mind and spirit , set my body parts dancing . A language half understood , brimming with much more than I could comprehend , but a language addressed to me , language belonging to me because it described me . Even when I did nt know exactly what a beat or rhythm or deep bass riff or falsetto trill were saying , I was seized . I could recognize what amounted to ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers or the Swan Silvertones or Dixie Hummingbirds or Hank Ballard and the Midnighters . Though I couldnt translate the lucid , shimmering counterpoint of quartet close harmony into words , part of the magic , the freedom of music meant that I did nt need to turn it into words . And I guess I was lucky or smart because I did nt try to translate . Music escaped the net of familiar , everyday language , the official , standard register of speech , the standardized sound and sense that too regularly felt as if they werent addressed to me , did nt belong to me . In various degrees Homewood folks resisted the dominant vernacular of the language , our speech played against it , or you could say fought , since our ways of talking were intended to detoxify certain features of the common language we felt unfairly raised some people ( not us ) up because they pronounced particular words in a specific fashion , people who , to our ears , flattened , depersonalized the rhythm of their English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated the pronunciation of individual words , who foregrounded the musical possibilities of their talk , speakers for whom cadence , repetition , tone , beat , metaphor , silence expressed a range of meanings and messages others might pursue by expanding and elaborating their vocabularies . The dominant language culture disrespected us , employed the arbitrary authority of its speech habits to mock our culturally inherited difference . Music assured me there was more out there to experience than a world already wrapped up tight in somebody elses words , words tangling me up in them while they also perversely excluded me . Long before I met Caliban , I experienced his ambivalence toward Prosperos tongue . Good African-American music said once upon a time Id been fluent in tongues the music spoke , and becoming an adult would surely involve relearning , needing to master these tongues again . Music promised more . It named me , stole my name , changed the names of familiar things around me , imbued ordinary situations with drama the way Hollywood soundtracks pump up the ante of mundane scenes . Transcendent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of music to expand the parameters of experience upward , elevating the spirit , extending the range of whats possible . Music ushers in a transcendent reality . Yes , it did and does rise , did inform my spirit , but musics messages just as consistently took dead aim at my flesh . Penetrated down to the bodys visceral core . Even gospel , with its drumbeat and holler and dance roots , worked down to the gut , groin , ground . Transcendent , okay , but better to say music opened me up and down and all around . Many years after leaving Homewood I encountered a Byzantine icon in a Cypriot church , a portrait of an angel with eyes all over , eyes on bosom , chin , wings , hands , arms , hundreds of all-seeing eyes , eyes all seen once the artist painted his vision . Pierced and transfigured by light , light entering , light going forth from the angels eyes , a nimbus of light crowning her , and I think thats a picture of how music transformed me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own songs . No , not transformed or transfigured . Those ideas a little too easy . Just like the angel pictures a little too pretty . But Im working . Working to help you see what I mean because that helps me see better . More . Were still on the more . Music said theres much more to life than meets the eye and said you were born with a gift , a faculty something like an eye or ear , and if you learn how to make it pay attention , it will reveal much more about the more there is to life , the more there is to you . Youll become different , you are different when you pay attention . Everythings larger than if you do nt . Today I say to myself a gift was planted long , long ago deep inside the music by wise people wishing the best for you , wishing something extra for you transfiguration , transformation more for you infused in African-American music by beleaguered people who foresaw your coming and understood how desperately youd need what theyd sown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves out , to save themselves , music tattooing invisible markings on their skin ( like those electronic dots stamped on your palm , unseeable except in a beam of infrared light you must pass your hand through before exiting from the prison visiting room ) . Hands clapping , feet stomping , a sway , beat , and keening moan , tribal markings aglow when the musics present , identifying your ancestors to each other , to you and yours in a vicious world that strips you and mocks your nakedness . African people who honored something precious in themselves worth too much to let anybody crush and found a means to pass on this knowledge , this more , this other inalienable part of themselves in the songs they sang , the rhythms thumped on drums or flesh with hands , sticks , feet , the whole bodys bump and glide , lift and fall through air . Finally , along with the music , also coming before and informing hoop , there were stories . They were out there . An oral history , so to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Somebodys ear . Staying alive . The thing was , since they were out there , being told and retold , you did nt have to think about them . Like money in the bank . You could count on them . There when you needed them . All kinds of stories for different occasions , to be told in particular places , at particular times , and as I hung around the court more and more , I heard the ball-playing ones . About hoop . About the playground game I can look back and say , yes , its something I truly loved , one of the few things truly loved . Of course , I love my children , my blood relatives , but thats a different love . I did nt have to fall in love to love them , because I cant fall out of love with them . They were here before I got here and will be here long after Im gone . They are who I am , all of us pieces of a larger thing each of us would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood we share and keep alive simply by living , by staying alive . Playground hoops something like that only its not there first time you open your eyes , open your mouth to breathe . Hoops like the people not blood kin you meet and love . You learn hoop . Then you fall in love . Learn the game and play the game a certain way and what you feel about it can turn to more than you ever dreamed a game could be , a game that starts out as messing around , trying to accomplish something vaguely challenging and fun , throw a ball through a hoop , a fun , silly kind of trick at first till you decide you want to do it better , shoot and never miss , pass and always deliver the ball where its supposed to go , jump up and never come down . The more you think about getting better , getting to be the best , the harder it is to play without dreaming about a perfect game .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
