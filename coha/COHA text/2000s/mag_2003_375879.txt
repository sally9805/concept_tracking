You know about vitameatavegemin . You know about the consuming romance and contentious breakup with Desi Arnaz . You know about the glory years of I Love Lucy and the slow slide into irrelevance with a string of Lucy knock-offs . But I 'll bet you did n't know this about Lucille Ball : " She once took an open-cockpit plane up in weather 20 below freezing to effect the rescue of a schoolboy . " <P> O.K. , so that last bit is a fib , concocted for Ball 's press biography by publicists for RKO , the studio she was under contract to in the late 1930s . They made it up because they  --  and the rest of Hollywood , for some two decades  --  had no idea how to best promote or cast the woman who in mid-life would become perhaps the most popular actress of the 20th century . Ball did n't easily fit any of the standard movie-star niches . The saucy girl from Jamestown , N.Y. , was pretty ( a former model ) but not va-va-voom sexy ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffeepot at a makeup man and missed , dousing Katharine Hepburn ) ; she was funny but in a slapstick way audiences were not used to from women . Nearing 40 , she was deep into a well-paid but unspectacular B-movie career when the opportunity came along to star in a TV show . Then , as Stefan Kanfer 's entertaining but unreflective biography Ball of Fire ( Knopf ; 361 pages ) details , she did what many unusual talents must . She created her own niche . <P> As Kanfer , a former TIME editor , presents her , Ball does fit one show-biz type well : the star whose early troubles ( father dies young , family suffers financial ruin ) fed an insecurity and need to please that paradoxically emboldened her to take risks . But as important as her talent and drive , Kanfer shows , was Arnaz , who handled her business savvily and smoothed over her tendency to bully co-stars and crew ( though he also made her miserable with his boozing and philandering ) . <P> Ball of Fire is subtitled The Tumultuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well by the tumultuous life , dishing with relish such anecdotes as the time Joan Crawford was a guest on The Lucy Show and declared that Ball " could ' outbitch ' her any day of the week . " But as for the comic art , he 's short on insight , he offers little cultural context , and his one original explanation for I Love Lucy 's enduring success is just weird : people love it because it is in black and white . " There is something incompatible , " Kanfer writes , " about humor and color . " ( Let 's see how Kanfer massages that theory should he ever write Jerry Seinfeld 's bio . ) <P> Ball 's many fans , however , will enjoy how vividly Kanfer captures Ball in her prime  --  brave , pioneering and , above all , ravenous for applause . It has become a cliche for tributes to Ball to gush about how much we love Lucy . What is just as important , Ball of Fire shows , is how much she loved us.  --  By James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
