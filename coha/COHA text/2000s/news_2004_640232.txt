<p> Before this weekend , none of the wrestlers in Class 4A 's 145-pound bracket knew much about Alamosa 's Mike Gallegos . <p> Now they do . <p> Gallegos produced perhaps the biggest upset of the state finals Saturday night when he held on to preserve a stunning 10-9 victory over Mullen senior Takafumi Hashimoto at the Pepsi Center . <p> Of the six defending state champions in the 4A field , only three were able to extend their reign . <p> Fort Morgan 's Chad Romero was among them , winning the 130-pound bracket to become just the 10th four-time champion in Colorado wrestling history . <p> Gallegos was brought up to 145 at last weekend 's regional after an injury to Alamosa 's Shane Gylling . Wrestling four pounds underweight , Gallegos fed off the notion that he was an unknown opponent . <p> The Alamosa junior , 34-3 this season , never trailed against Hashimoto and led 6-2 following a near fall late in the first period . Hashimoto , last year 's 140-pound champion , tied it 8-8 with one second left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a reversal with 1:29 left in the third period . <p> The two wrestlers locked up for the final 11 seconds . Hashimoto got his leg over Gallegos , but could n't get into position to get the all-important two points . <p> ' I knew when he got the leg over it was going to be close , ' Gallegos said . ' I just held on for dear life . ' <p> ' Those last few seconds do n't even come into account if we wrestle the way we should have , ' Mullen coach Vince Massey said . <p> Pueblo South crowned just one individual champion - Tano Miell at 171 - but won the 4A team title with 121 1/2 points . Miell gave Fountain-Fort Carson 's Aarick Wilson his first loss of the year , 12-6 . <p> Defending team champion Moffat County finished second this year with 111 1/2 points . <p> A bloody Derek Brewer of Delta ( 34-2 ) handed defending champion Nathan Gallegos of Westminster his first loss of the season with a 7-4 decision in the 119 final . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first period , but the referee had to blow the whistle as blood began to pour from Brewer 's nose . <p> ' I think if I could have stuck with it , I could have pinned him , ' Brewer said . <p> Brewer used up 2 minutes , 28 seconds of his five minutes of allotted recovery time . He also gave Gallegos ample time to regroup . <p> ' I did n't feel winded and I wanted to keep going , ' Brewer said . ' I did n't want to keep stopping it for ( Gallegos ) . ' <p> Pueblo East senior Markus Portillos knocked off another defending champion , Marques Bravo of Fort Lupton , with a 9-6 decision in the 125 final . Portillos broke a 3-3 tie late in the first period with a takedown and near fall to take a commanding 8-3 lead . <p> Adams City 's Joey Deaguero ( 42-0 ) needed an escape with 23 seconds remaining to win the 140 final , 7-6 over Fort Morgan 's Travis Kroskob . Deaguero was the champion at 135 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 215 pounds ) produced the first pin of the 4A finals when he downed Mountain View 's Calvin Kliner at 1:18 . <p> Greeley Central 's Tony Mustari , a champion last year at 103 , continued his domination of the 112 bracket with an 8-0 major decision over Broomfield junior John Ness . <p> Mustari , a junior , was leading 3-0 going into the third period when he picked up his final five points on two near falls . Mustari had no pins during the state tournament , but outpointed his four opponents by a whopping 50-3 . <p> ' My coaches always tell me that you do n't always have to make it a show , ' Mustari said . ' You do n't have to get a pin or technical fall every time . I 'll take the win . ' <p> Mustari , 43-0 this season and 81-1 since the beginning of his sophomore season , already is thinking about becoming the first wrestler from his school to win three titles . <p> ' I 'm going to come back harder , bigger and stronger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 121 1/2 , Moffat County 111 1/2 , Broomfield 89 , Fort Morgan 87 1/2 , Adams City 75 , Montrose 71 , Alamosa 68 1/2 , Pueblo West 60 1/2 , Widefield 60 , Centaurus 56 1/2 , Delta 55 , Greeley West 48 1/2 , Fort Lupton 47 1/2 , Pueblo East 47 1/2 , Cheyenne Mountain 44 1/2 , Liberty 40 , Westminster 36 , Mountain View 35 1/2 , Northridge 33 , Greeley Central 31 1/2 , Rifle 27 , Mullen 25 , Fountain-Fort Carson 24 , Lewis-Palmer 23 1/2 , Berthoud 23 , Falcon 22 , Longmont 19 , Niwot 19 , Woodland Park 19 , Pueblo Central 18 , Sterling 17 , Skyline 16 1/2 , Pine Creek 16 , Caon City 16 , Harrison 14 , Elizabeth 12 , Windsor 10 , Palisade 10 , Sand Creek 9 , Ralston Valley 8 , Golden 7 , Silver Creek 6 , Battle Mountain 6 , Conifer 5 , Alameda 4 , Pueblo County 4 . <p> Championship matches <p> 103 - Taylor Gallegos , Montrose , Jr .
