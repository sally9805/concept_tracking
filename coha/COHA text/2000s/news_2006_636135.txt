<p> There is nothing sexier than a convertible to most Americans  --  almost any make of convertible . <p> When sports car sales reached respectable levels in this country in the mid-1950s , folks who were n't foreign car buffs continued to opt for domestic convertibles if they wanted an auto with a sporty , carefree personality . <p> Nearly all sports cars had convertible tops , but most drivers felt they were too small and of strictly limited use ; only two adults fit in them and their luggage space was tight . So much for sports cars such as MGs , Triumphs and Jaguars . <p> But even the flashiest American convertibles , such as the Cadillac Eldorado , had a back seat and a fairly big trunk . <p> The ironic thing was that most cars had convertible tops in the early part of the last century because technology did n't exist to mass produce autos with hard tops , let alone those with roll-up windows . By the 1930s , though , hardtops were the way to go . <p> By then , convertibles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally had racier styling than hardtops and were considered a luxury because few people could afford both a family hardtop and a convertible until the newly affluent 1950s . <p> Sports cars now are very much a part of the mainstream convertible market , which has a wide range of models . <p> Convertibles always have accounted for a small percentage of auto sales because most have been bought as second , third or even fourth family cars . However , the growing number of retractable hardtop convertibles sold by everyone from Pontiac and Saturn to Lexus and Mercedes-Benz promises to make top-down cars more acceptable to those who want both the fun of top-down motoring and a hardtop 's security and comfort . <p> With summer in full swing , here are highlights and approximate price ranges of under-$85,000 convertibles sold in America : <p> Audi A4/S4 ( $37,400-$54,600 ) : While pricey , these smoothly styled upscale models have good performance and high-quality construction , but little rear-seat or cargo room with the top down . <p> Audi TT ( $36,000-$$43,600 ) : It 's one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's only room for two , but it 's sold with front or all-wheel drive . A significantly new model is due for 2007 . <p> BMW 3-Series ( $39,600-$56,600 ) : Refined and fun to drive , but based on a 1999 design and due for a 2007 replacement . Tight back seat . <p> BMW 6-Series ( $78,800 ) : While fast and sophisticated , it has controversial rear styling and a tight rear seat . <p> BMW Z4 ( $$35,600-$52,000 ) : One of the zoomiest looking two-seat convertibles . The standard 215-horsepower model is fine but the most expensive " M " version has a 330-horsepower six-cylinder engine and oh-my-gosh performance . <p> Cadillac XLR ( $76,500 ) : This two-seater is sort of a luxury version of the Chevrolet Corvette but has plenty of features and performance . ( There 's a $97,485 version with a 443-horsepower supercharged V-8 , but it crosses the $85,000 line and is generally superfluous . ) <p> Chevrolet Corvette ( $43,700-$64,900 ) : It offers the most performance per dollar of any car sold in the world , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsepower . <p> Chrysler Crossfire ( $34,200-$49,500 ) : This two-seater is actually a holdover 2005 model but has racy styling and is based on the last-generation Mercedes-Benz SLK . The supercharged , 330-horsepower SRT6 version is mighty fast . Inventories are high , so buyers should get a good deal . <p> Chrysler PT Cruiser ( $19,900-$29,000 ) : This four-seater is really different , looking like a 1950s hot rod . The standard 170-horsepower four-cylinder engine is OK for cruising , but the 180-horsepower turbocharged engine is better and a 220-horsepower turbo engine is available . <p> Chrysler Sebring ( $26,100-$31,700 ) : It comes in a variety of trim levels and long has been among the best-selling domestic convertibles . Decent rear-seat room . <p> Dodge Viper SRT10 ( $82,000-$83,000 ) : Its rakish styling turns heads and it 's got a 510-horsepower V-10 . A limited-production two-seater , it 's mostly for hard-core auto buffs and is less comfortable than the standard 400-horsepower Corvette . <p> Ford Mustang ( $23,940-$31,145 ) : This iconic four-seater never has had much rear-seat room but practically defines the small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 210-horsepower V-6 , but the GT , which starts at $25,140 , is a solid buy with its 300-horsepower V-8 . <p> Honda S2000 ( $34,000 ) : This is a pure two-seat sports car with a docile , race-style engine . Styling is rather conservative , but clean . <p> Jaguar XK ( $74,800-$80,800 ) : The XK has an aggressive new design that makes it more of a pure sports car than its predecessor and less of a luxury cruiser . It 's fast and refined , with advanced construction . Two small adults can squeeze in back , but it 's basically a two-seater . <p> Lexus SC 430 ( $65,400 ) : It 's a retractable hardtop loaded with comfort , convenience and safety equipment . The rear styling is offbeat , but it 's still stylish . <p> Lotus Elise ( $44,000 ) : This very fast mid-engine two-seater has a reliable Toyota engine but is one of the closest things to a race car you can drive on the street . <p> Mazda MX-5 Miata ( $20,400-$26,700 ) : While redesigned for 2006 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular two-seat convertibles since its 1990 introduction . It 's still among the most fun-to-drive cars ever built . <p> Mercedes Benz CLK Class ( $53,700-$82,500 ) : The base model is fine  --  let the hot shoes opt for the $82,000-plus CLK55 version with a 362-horsepower V-8 . This stylish four-seater is plenty sporty and luxurious . Rear-seat space is rather tight . <p> Mercedes-Benz SLK Class ( $42,900-$61,500 ) : The SLK kicked off the retractable hardtop craze in 1998 , and this two-seater has been considerably updated since then . Most folks are best off with the lower-cost versions of the car that end at about $47,000  --  not the 355-horsepower $61,500 model . <p> Mini Cooper S ( $22,000-$25,400 ) : The spiffy Mini retains the basic shape of the iconic British Mini but is far more refined , coming now from BMW . While the hardtop version is fun , the convertible version is sportier . There is n't much rear-seat space , but it 's a blast to drive , especially with the ( costlier ) turbocharged engine . <p> Mitsubishi Eclipse ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an early 2007 convertible , although its rear seat is best left to children and pets . The 162-horsepower four-cylinder is fine for easy cruising , but the 263-horsepower V-6 in the GT version is available for serious performance . <p> Nissan 350Z ( $35,000-$41,000 ) : This is another pure two-seat sports car convertible  --  fast and good handling , with striking styling . <p> Pontiac G6 ( $27,800-$29,400 ) : It 's among the newest retractable hardtops and the only one that costs less than $30,000  --  at least until Volkswagen 's retractable arrives this fall with a comparable price . It 's as stylish as the G6 coupe and has a good back-seat area . However , the top is difficult to put down or up . <p> Pontiac Solstice ( $19,900 ) : Much in demand , this two-seater is a head-turner and has decent acceleration and excellent handling . But the convertible top is n't easy to use and there 's little cargo room with the top up  --  and practically none when it 's lowered . <p> Porsche 911 Cabriolet ( $81,400 ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one under $85,000 . But it 's one of the ultimate sports car convertibles . It can be used daily but has astounding performance when needed and at least a tiny rear seat area . <p> Porsche Boxster ( $45,000-$54,700 ) : This mid-engine two-seater has become one of the most popular Porsches , if only because it costs less than the 911 . It 's also a genuine high-performance sports car that can be used daily . <p> Saab 9-3 ( $36,500-$41,900 ) : Here 's another soft-top model with a large rear-seat area , although it 's among the most sophisticated European convertibles with far more going for it than room for four adults . The base version has a turbocharged 210-horsepower four-cylinder , while the top-line Aero gets a turbocharged 250-horsepower V-6 . With the top up , its trunk is among the largest of any convertibles , but shrinks when the top is lowered . <p> Saturn Sky ( $23,100 ) : This new two-seater is nearly mechanically identical to Pontiac 's Solstice but is larger and looks more substantial . It also has more glitz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher base price than the Solstice . The Sky  --  Saturn 's first sports car  --  also is in great demand but shares the small cargo area and difficult-to-work top of the Solstice . <p> Toyota Camry Solara ( $27,200-$30,500 ) : The Solara is revised for 2007 , with such items as a revised fascia and rear end . There also is a new sporty version with larger wheels and a rear spoiler . It remains a comfortable , laid-back four-passenger cruiser with an easily operated power top . <p> Volkswagen New Beetle ( $22,100-$$23,200 ) : This retro-style four-seater has a manual or power soft top , more powerful engine and fresh styling touches . The rear seat is tight , and the trunk is small but usefully shaped . A real charmer . <p> Volvo C70 ( $38,700 ) : Among the newest retractable hardtops , this model has decent rear seat room and looks sharp even with its top up . It 's got an elaborate rollover protection system and lots of standard comfort and convenience equipment . <p> e-mail : djedlicka@suntimes.com Photo : Audi TT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miata : incredibly fun to drive. ; Photo : Cadillac XLR : lots of features , performance. ; Photo : Mercedes-Benz SLK : kicked off the retractable hardtop craze in 1998.
