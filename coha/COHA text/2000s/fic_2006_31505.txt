Jennifer Jennifer Crane . That 's it . That 's my name . Ever heard of me ? I 'm guessing not , which , frankly , sums up my entire problem with my life as it currently stands : I 'm not famous . And , as far as I can tell , the fame fairy is n't going to be anointing me any time soon . Sucks , does n't it ? And what really reeks is that I 'm good . I 've got a voice on me that rivals Julie Andrew 's ( and that 's before she had throat surgery ) . Actually , you know what ? I take that back . I 'm pretty sure it 's a grievous sin to compare yourself to Julie Andrews , who is , in my opinion , a goddess of stage and screen . The woman has some serious pipes . But , honestly , I could give Patti LuPone , Joanna Gleason , or Betty Buckley a run for their money any old day . Which begs the question of why I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a singing waitress instead of opening on Broadway . Obviously , the right part has n't come along . Or agent . Or director . Or producer . I do n't think it 's me . Really I do n't . The thing is , I could be wrong . I try not to think about that , though . Someone once said that success is ninety-eight percent attitude , and I 'm definitely staying optimistic . ( And never mind that the someone who said that was me . It 's perfectly sound wisdom and , frankly , I trust myself more than I trust anyone else . ) All of which is little more than a backdrop to the reason why I ended up singing Gloria Gaynor 's " I Will Survive " despite the fact that I am not a gay male and had n't even rehearsed the thing . It was all Brian 's fault . He 's a self-proclaimed screaming tenor , has slept with more producers than I 've auditioned for , and is one of my absolute best friends . We worked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until last week when he was hired to replace an actor who 'd tripped down the subway stairs and busted his femur all to hell . No kidding . It was like something out of All About Eve , except that Brian had n't even been an understudy . Apparently he 'd auditioned for the show early on , did reasonably well , and the producer remembered him . The other actor 's broken leg was , literally , Brian 's big break . And he landed himself a minor , but important , role , the bastard . Not that I 'm bitter or anything , but talk about luck . At any rate , the show is called Puck 's Dream , it 's a new musical loosely based on A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Lots of production numbers , lots of effects . Brian 's even featured in two scenes , and in one he actually gets to fly across the stage . From what he tells me , it 's pretty cool , and I 'm trying very hard , albeit somewhat unsuccessfully , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Belasco Theater in about a week , and Brian 's cousin Felix  --  aka Fifi for reasons I 'm not even going to bother going into  --  had come in from Los Angeles to help Bri celebrate . Naturally , Brian brought Fifi to the diner . And , just as naturally , he was giving me a hard time . ( Brian , that is . Not his cousin . ) " Sweetie , " Brian said , squeezing in beside the condiments , " you 're positively maudlin . You need some serious cheer . After work . Drinks . And I wo n't take no for an answer . " " Are you concerned about me ? Or are you just trying to make sure you 're not alone with Fifi ? " " Well , he is a little high maintenance , but you know I love him . And do n't change the subject , anyway . " I made a face . " You 're not even supposed to be back here anymore . " " I go where I 'm needed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at you ! You 're going to bring down the crowd if you go out there like that . What are you planning on singing , anyway ? ' Memory ' ? " I scowled because he 'd totally pegged me . " Maybe , " I said . I could n't help it . I was morose . I 'd auditioned that morning for an off-Broadway revival of Carousel , a show I know inside and out , and absolutely love , but I swear I might as well have stood on that stage and farted for all the good my rehearsing did me . I could n't even see the producer or the director past the stage lights . All I heard was a cough and then a curt , " Thank you . We 'll be in touch . " And then the stage manager was ushering me off the stage . Granted , that 's often par for the course in the world of open call auditions , but I 'd really expected the director to leap to his feet , race to the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not that , then I 'd at least expected a good vibe . As it was , I got zilch . No vibe , no job , no nothing . " Attitude , " Brian said , tossing my philosophy back in my face . " Remember ? " He pointed toward the main part of the restaurant , where rows of booths were filled with people eating mostly bad-for-you food that really is delicious ( I gained ten pounds my first month , then put myself on a strict diet that I 've mostly stuck to ever since ) . Leslie Danziger was strutting her stuff on the railing that ran between two sets of booths . Her microphone was close enough to swallow , her blond wig was slightly askew , and she was belting out " Girls Just Want to Have Fun . " She was clearly having a great time . Obviously , she had n't had a crap audition just a few hours before . " I 'm switching you , " Brian said . " Michael 's on after Leslie . And you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hell I am . " I turned behind me and found Michael , who I like a lot , but who also happens to be a huge wimp with an equally huge crush on Brian . He just shrugged and blew me a kiss . I knew I was sunk . Done in by two gay men with an agenda . " Attitude , sweetie . Do you want to be consigned to failure ? Do you want to sit and mope ? Do you want to let your depression fester inside you and give you ulcers and cold sores ? One is not fun and the other is such a bad look for you . " As a matter of fact , I did want to sulk , but I knew better than to argue with Brian . " Fine . Fine . What is Michael  --  what am I  --  singing ? " " ' I Will Survive . ' " " I do n't think so . " " Sweetie , trust me . You need an attitude adjustment . " I did need an attitude adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay male power anthems to make them . Call me crazy , but my best attitude adjustments come when I 'm shopping . Brian , however , was deaf to my protests . He shoved the microphone into my hand , pressed his palm against my back , signaled to Damien ( who runs the sound equipment ) , and pushed . Suddenly all eyes in the room were on me , and I could either belt out the tune or stand there looking like an idiot . Since I do n't do idiot well , I sang . And you know what ? I did feel better . Not at first , mind you . At first , I just felt pissed off . At Brian . But then the words infiltrated my brain . Like Gloria Gaynor , I was strong . I could get along . And , dammit , I was a survivor . Maybe Carousel did n't want me , but someone would . I 'd find an agent . I 'd hit the streets . I 'd blow away every producer from 41st to 53rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would splashed across Playbill , and the crowds would be lining up around the block , just like they did for Spamalot . ( Hey , a girl can dream . ) In the end , I nailed that tune . I strutted my stuff , flirted with the men , bonded with the women , and threw a final kiss to Fifi . And when the song was over , I turned on my heel , tossed the microphone to Damien , then launched myself at Brian . He spun me around , my poodle skirt flaring in a way that probably lacked a certain level of modesty . " Better ? " " Totally , " I admitted . I crushed my palms against his cheeks and planted a huge kiss right on his mouth . " You 're a better mood enhancer than Xanax . " So what if I 'd flubbed an audition ? There would be others . It was n't as if I was dead . The sun would come out tomorrow . I was going to put on a happy face . Nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other sunshiney clichs . Bottom line ? I was coming out of this a winner . And nothing  --  not bad agents or tasteless producers or even rude customers  --  was going to change that . Continues ...
