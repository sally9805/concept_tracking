Chapter Three Matthew 's eyes opened with a start . The light had dwindled to murky yellow , the candle having burned itself to a shrunken stub . Beside him on the harsh straw , Woodward was snoring noisily , mouth half ajar and chinflesh quivering . It took Matthew a few seconds to realize that there was a wetness on his left cheek . Then another drop of rainwater fell from the sodden ceiling onto his face and he abruptly sat up with a curse clenched behind his teeth . The sudden movement made a rodent  --  a very large one , from the sound  --  squeal in alarm and scurry with a scrabbling of claws back into its nest in the wall . The noise of rain falling from the ceiling onto the floor was a veritable tenpence symphony . Matthew thought the time for building an ark was close at hand . Perhaps Abner was right about it being the end of the world ; the year 1700 might never be marked on a calendar . Be that as it may , he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more as well , from the weight of his bowels . Damned if he would n't have to go out in that weather and squat down like a beast . Might try to hold it , but some things could not be constrained . He would relieve himself in the woods behind the barn like a civilized manwhile the rats did their business on the floor beside the bed . Next trip  --  God forbid  --  he would remember to pack a chamberpot . He got out of the torture apparatus that passed as a bed . The tavern was quiet ; it was a slim hour , to be sure . Distant thunder rumbled , the storm still lingering over the Carolina colony like a black-winged vulture . Matthew worked his feet into his shoes . He did n't have a heavy coat of his own , so over his flannel nightshirt he donned the magistrate 's fearnaught , which was still damp from Woodward 's recent trek behind the barn . The magistrate 's boots , standing beside the bed , were clotted with mud and would bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . Matthew did n't want to take the single candle , as the weather would quickly extinguish it and the wall-dwellers might become emboldened by the dark . He would carry a covered lantern from the other room , he decided , and hope it threw enough illumination to avoid what Woodward had told him was " an unholy mess " out there . He might check on the horses , too , while he was so near the barn . He placed his hand on the door latch and started to lift it when he heard the magistrate cease snoring and quietly moan . Glancing at the man , he saw Woodward 's face wince and contort under the freckled dome of his bald head . Matthew paused , watching in the dim and flickering light . Woodward 's mouth opened , his eyelids fluttering . " Oh , " the magistrate whispered , very clearly . His voice , though a whisper , was wracked with what Matthew could only describe as a pure and terrible agony . " Ohhhhh , " Woodward spoke , in his cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drew a pained breath . " Hurting he 's hurting oh God Ann ... hurting ... " He said something more , a jumble of a few words mingled with another low awful moan . His hands were gripping at the front of his nightshirt , his head pressed back into the straw . His mouth released a faint sound that might have been the memory of a cry , and then slowly his body relaxed and the snoring swelled up once again . This was not something new to Matthew . Many nights the magistrate walked in a dark field of pain , but what its source was he refused to talk about . Matthew had asked him once , five years ago , what the trouble had been , and Woodward 's response had been a rebuke that Matthew 's task was learning the trade of judicial clerking , and if he did not care to learn that trade , he could always find a home again at the orphans ' refuge . The message  --  delivered with uncharacteristic vinegar  --  had been clear : whatever haunted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had something to do with his wife in London , Matthew believed . Ann must be her name , though Woodward never mentioned that name in his waking hours and never volunteered any information about the woman . In fact , though Matthew had been in the company of Isaac Woodward since turning fifteen years old , he knew very little about the man 's past life in England . This much he did know : Woodward had been a lawyer of some fame and had found success in the financial field as well , but what had caused his reversal of fortune and why he had left London for the roughhewn colonies remained mysteries . At least Matthew understood from his readings and from what Woodward said about London that it was a great city ; he 'd never set foot there , or in England either , for he 'd been born aboard a ship on the Atlantic nineteen days out of Portsmouth . Matthew quietly lifted the latch and left the room . In the darkened chamber beyond , small flames still gnawed at black bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coals had been banked for the night . Bitter smoke lingered in the air . Hanging from hooks next to the fireplace were two lanterns , both made of hammered tin with small nail-holes punched in the metal for the light to pass through . One of the lanterns had a burnt candle stuck on its inner spike , so that was the illuminator Matthew chose . He found a pine twig on the floor , touched it alight in the remains of the fire , and transferred the flame to the candle 's wick . " What are you about ? Eh ? " The voice , cutting the silence as it did , almost lifted Matthew out of his shoes . He twisted around and the lantern 's meager but spreading light fell upon Will Shawcombe , who was sitting at one of the tables with a tankard before him and a black-scorched clay pipe clenched in his teeth . " You up prowlin ' , boy ? " Shawcombe 's eyes were deepsunken and the skin of his face was daubed dirty yellow in the candlelight . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... have to go out , " Matthew replied , still unnerved . Shawcombe drew slowly on his pipe . " Well , " he said , " mind your legs , then . Awful sloppy out there . " Matthew nodded . He started to turn toward the door , but Shawcombe spoke up again : " Your master would n't want to part with that fine waistc't , would he ? " " No , he would n't . " Though he knew Shawcombe was baiting him , he could n't let it go past . " Mr. Woodward is not my master . " " He ai n't , huh ? Well then , how come he tells you what you can do and what you cai n't ? Seems to me he 's the master and you 're the slave . " " Mr. Woodward looks out for my interest . " " Uh huh . " Shawcombe tilted his head back and fired a dart of smoke at the ceiling . " Makes you cart the baggage , then he wo n't even let you dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to be guarded . And you a twenty-year-old man ! I 'll bet he makes you scrape the mud off his boots , do n't he ? " " I 'm his clerk , " Matthew said pointedly . " Not his valet . " " Does he clean his own boots , or do you ? " Matthew paused . The truth was that he did clean the magistrate 's boots , but it was a task he did without complaint . Some things over the years  --  such as organizing the judicial paperwork , keeping their living quarters in order , darning the clothes , packing the trunks , and arranging sundry other small affairs  --  had fallen to Matthew simply because he was much more efficient at taking care of details . " I knew you did it , " Shawcombe went on . " Man like that 's got blue blood in his veins . He do n't want to get them hands too dirty , does he ? Yeah , like I said , he 's the master and you 're the slave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe what I see , " Shawcombe said . " Come over here , lemme show you somethin ' . You bein ' a slave and all , you might well want to have a look . " Before Matthew could decline and go on his way , Shawcombe lifted his right fist and opened it . " Here 's somethin ' you ai n't never seen before and ai n't like to see again . " The lantern 's light sparked off the surface of a gold coin . " Here ! " Shawcombe offered it to Matthew . " I 'll even let you hold it . " Against his better judgment  --  and the urge to pee pressing on his bladder  --  Matthew approached the man and took the coin from him . He held it close to the lantern and inspected the engraving . It was a well-worn piece , much of the lettering rubbed off , but at its center was a cross that separated the figures of two lions and two castles . Matthew could make out the faint letters Charles II and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that is ? " Shawcombe prodded . " Charles the Second is the King of Spain , " Matthew said . " So this must be Spanish . " " That 's right . Spanish . You know what that means , do n't you ? " " It means a Spaniard was recently here ? " " Close . I got this from a dead redskin 's pouch . Now what 's a redskin doin ' with a Spanish gold piece ? " He did n't wait for Matthew to venture a guess . " Means there 's a damn Spanish spy ' round here somewhere . Stirrin ' up some trouble with the Indians , most like . You know them Spaniards are sittin ' down there in the Florida country , not seventy leagues from here . They got spies all in the colonies , spreadin ' the word that any black crow who flies from his master and gets to the Florida country can be a free man . You ever heard such a thing ? Them Spaniards are promisin ' the same thing to criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swiped the coin from Matthew 's hand . " If you was to run to Florida and your master was to want you back , them Spaniards would jus ' laugh at him . Same 's true of somebody done a stealin ' or a murder : get to Florida , them Spaniards would protect him . I tell you , once them blackamoors start runnin ' to Florida by the scores and gettin ' turned into free men , this world 's gon na roast in Hell 's fires . " Shawcombe dropped the coin into the tankard , which still had liquid in it , judging from the sound of the wet plop , then sat smoking his pipe with his arms crossed over his chest . " Yeah , " he said with a knowing nod , " a Spanish spy 's out there , payin ' the redskins to get up to some mischief . Hell , he might even be livin ' in Fount Royal , an Englishman turned blackcoat ! " " Possibly . " Matthew 's need for relief was now undeniable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on , then . Like I say , watch where you step . " Shawcombe let Matthew get to the door and then said , " Hey , clerk ! You sure he would n't part with that waistc't ? " " Absolutely sure . " Shawcombe grunted , his head wreathed with blue pipesmoke . " I did n't think so , " he said in a quiet voice . Matthew unlatched the door and went out . The storm had quietened somewhat , the rain falling now as misty drizzle . In the sky , though , distant lightning flashed through the clouds . The mud clasped hold of Matthew 's shoes . A half-dozen steps through the mire , Matthew had to lift up his nightshirt and urinate where he stood . Decorum , however , dictated that he relieve his bowels in the woods behind the barn , for there were no leaves or pine needles nearby with which to clean himself . When he finished , he followed the lantern 's glow past the barn , his shoes sinking up to the ankles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gathered a handful of wet leaves and then crouched down to attend to his business . The lightning danced overhead , he was soaked , muddy , and miserable , and all in all it was a nasty moment . Such things , however , could not be rushed no matter how fervently one tried . After what seemed an eternity , during which Matthew cursed Shawcombe and swore again to pack a chamberpot on their next journey , the deed was completed and the wet leaves put to use . He straightened up and held the lantern out to find his path back to the so-called tavern . Once more the waterlogged ground opened and closed around his shoes , his kneejoints fairly popping as he worked his legs loose from the quagmire . He intended to check on the horses before he returned to the so-called bed , where he could look forward to the magistrate 's snoring , the rustling of rats , and rainwater dripping on his  - -  He fell . It was so fast he hardly knew what was happening . His initial thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His second thought , which he barely had an eyeblink of time to act upon , was to keep the lantern from being extinguished . So even as he fell on his belly and the mud and water splashed around him and over the magistrate 's fearnaught coat , he was able to lift his arm up and protect the light . He spat mud out of his mouth , his face aflame with anger , and said , " Damn it to Hell ! " Then he tried to sit up , mud all over his face , his sight most blinded . He found this task harder than it should have been . His legs , he realized , had been seized by the earth . The very ground had collapsed under his shoes , and now his feet were entangled in something that felt like a bramble bush down in the swampy muck . Careful of the lantern , he wrenched his right foot loose but whatever held his left foot would not yield . Lightning flared again and the rain started falling harder . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he braced himself as best he could and jerked his left leg up and out of the morass . There was a brittle cracking sound . His leg was free . But as he shone the lantern down upon his leg , Matthew realized he 'd stepped into something that had come out of the earth still embracing his ankle . At first he did n't know what it was . His foot had gone right through what looked like a mud-dripping cage of some kind . He could see the splintered edges , one of which had scraped a bleeding gouge in his leg . The rain was slowly washing mud off the object . As he stared at it , another flash of lightning helped aid his recognition of what held him , and his heart felt gripped by a freezing hand . Matthew 's anatomy studies did not have to be recollected to tell him that he 'd stepped into and through a human-sized rib cage . A section of spinal cord was still attached , and on it clung bits of grayish-brown material that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry and began frantically kicking at the thing with his other shoe . The bones cracked , broke , and fell away , and when the last of the rib cage and vertebrae had been kicked loose Matthew crawled away from it as fast as the mud would allow . Then he sat up amid leaves and pine needles and pressed his back against a treetrunk , the breath rasping in his lungs and his eyes wide and shocked . He thought , numbly , how distraught the magistrate was going to be over the fearnaught coat . Such coats were not easy to come by . It was ruined , no doubt . A rib cage . Human-sized . Ruined beyond all hope of cleaning . Damn this rain and mud , damn this wild land , and damn Shawcombe and the chamberpot he should have had . A rib cage , Matthew thought . Rain was running down his face now . It was cold , and the chill helped him organize his mind . Of course , the rib cage might 've belonged to an animal . Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providence !  --  the candle was still burning . He stood up and made his way over to the broken bones . There he knelt down and shone the light upon them , trying to determine what animal they might 've come from . While he was so occupied , he heard a soft slithering sound somewhere to his right . He angled the lantern toward it and in a few seconds saw that a gaping hole some four feet across had opened in the boggy ground ; the slithering sound was mud sliding down its sides . Matthew thought it might have been what had collapsed under his feet and caused him to fall , for the earth itself was rebelling against this incessant downpour . He stood up , eased to the edge of the hole , and directed the lantern 's light down into it . At first he saw what looked like a pile of sticks lying in the hole . Everything was muddy and tangled together into an indistinct mess . The longer he stared , however , the more clear came the picture . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an arm , thrown across what might 've been a half-decayed , naked torso . A gray kneejoint jutted up from the muck . There was a hand , the fingers shriveled to the bones , grasping upward as if in a begging gesture for help . And there was a head , too ; mostly a mud-covered skull , but some of the flesh remained . Matthew , his mouth dry of saliva and his heart pounding , could see how the top of the skull had been crushed inward by a savage blow . A hammer could 've delivered such a death , he realized . A hammer or a rat-killing mallet . Perhaps there were more corpses than one in that burial pit . Perhaps there were four or five , thrown in and entangled together . It was hard to tell how many , but there were a great number of bones . None of the bodies seemed to have been buried with their clothing . Hey , clerk ! You sure he would n't part with that waistc't ? Matthew felt the earth shift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen serpents hissing and , as the ground began to collapse around him , Matthew saw more human bones being pushed up to the surface like the muddy spars of ships wrecked on vicious shoals . Dazed as if locked in a nightmare , Matthew stood at the center of the sinking earth as evidence of murders revealed themselves under his shoes . Only when he was about to be sucked under into an embrace with the dead did he turn away , pulling his feet up and struggling toward the barn . He fought his way through the rain in the direction of the tavern . The immediacy of his mission gave flight to his heels . He slipped and fell once again before he reached the door , and this time the lantern splashed into a puddle and the candle went out . Red mud covered him from head to toe . When he burst through the door , he saw that Shawcombe was no longer sitting at the table , though the tankard was still in its same position and the bitter-smelling pipesmoke yet wafted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the magistrate , and he got into the room and latched the door behind him . Woodward was still stretched out and soundly asleep . Matthew shook the man 's shoulders . " Wake up ! Do you hear me ? " His voice , though pinched with fright , was strong enough to pierce the veil of the magistrate 's sleep . Woodward began to rouse himself , his eyelids opening and the bleary eyes struggling to focus . " We have to get out ! " Matthew urged . " Right now ! We 've got to  --  " " Good God in Heaven ! " Woodward croaked . He sat upright . " What happened to you ? " " Just listen ! " Matthew said . " I found bodies out there ! Skeletons , buried behind the barn ! I think Shawcombe 's a murderer ! " " What ? Have you lost your senses ? " Woodward sniffed the younger man 's breath . " It 's that damn Indian ale , is n't it ? " " No , I found the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingsbury and thrown him in there ! " He saw the magistrate 's expression of bewilderment . " Listen to me ! We have to leave as fast as we  --  " " Gentlemen ? " It was Shawcombe . His voice beyond the door made Matthew 's blood go cold . There came the rap of knuckles on the wood . " Gentlemen , is all well ? " " I think he means to kill us tonight ! " Matthew whispered to the magistrate . " He wants your waistcoat ! " " My waistcoat , " Woodward repeated . His mouth was dry . He looked at the door and then back to Matthew 's mud-splattered face . If anything was true in this insane world , it was that Matthew did not lie , nor was he servant to flights of fantasy . The shiny fear in the younger man 's eyes was all too real , and Woodward 's own heart began beating rapidly . " Gents ? " Now Shawcombe 's mouth was close to the door . " I heard you talkin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Woodward replied . He put a finger to his lips , directing Matthew to be silent . " We 're very well , thank you ! " There was a few seconds ' pause . Then : " Clerk , you left the front door open , " Shawcombe said . " How come you to do that ? " Now came one of the most terrible decisions of Isaac Woodward 's life . His saber , as rusted and blunt as it was , remained in the wagon . He had neither a dirk nor a prayer to protect them . If Shawcombe was indeed a killer , the time had arrived for him to deliver death . Woodward looked at the room 's single shuttered window and made the decision : they would have to leave everything behind  --  trunks , wigs , clothing , all of it  --  to save their skins . He motioned Matthew toward the window and then he eased up out of the damp straw . " What 's got your tongue , boy ? " Shawcombe demanded . His voice was turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just a moment ! " Woodward opened one of the trunks , lifted a pair of shirts , and put his hands on the golden-threaded waistcoat . He could not leave this , even with a murderer breathing down his neck . There was no time to work his feet into his boots nor grab his tricorn hat . Grasping the waistcoat , he straightened up and motioned for Matthew to unlatch the window 's shutter . Matthew did . The latch thunked out of its groove and he pushed the shutter open into the falling rain . " They 're comin ' out the winda ! " Uncle Abner yelled , standing just beneath it . Matthew saw he was holding a lantern in one hand and a pitchfork in the other . Behind Woodward , there was a tremendous crash as the door burst inward . He twisted around , his face bleached of blood , as Shawcombe came across the threshold with a grin that showed his peglike teeth . Behind him , Maude carried a double candlestick that held two burning tapers , her white hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh ! " Shawcombe said mockingly . " Looky here , Maude ! They 're tryin ' to get gone without payin ' their bill ! " " What 's the meaning of this outrage ? " Woodward snapped , putting on a mask of anger to hide his true emotion , which was raw and naked terror . Shawcombe laughed and shook his head . " Well , " he said , lifting up his right hand and inspecting the mallet with which Maude had earlier crushed the black rat , " the meanin ' of it , you bloody ass , is that you and the clerk ai n't goin ' nowhere tonight . ' Cept Hell , I reckon . " His eyes found the prize . " Ahhhhh , there ' t is . Give it here . " He thrust out his grimy left hand . Woodward looked at the dirty fingers and then at the waistcoat he held so dearly . His gaze returned to Shawcombe 's greedy hand ; then Woodward lifted his chin and took a long breath . " Sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it . " Shawcombe laughed again , more of a piggish grunt this time . " Oh , indeedy I 'll kill you ! " His eyes narrowed slightly . " I ' spected you 'd go out like a mouse ' stead of a man , though . ' Spected you might give a squeal like that other little drunk titmouse did when I whacked him . " He abruptly swung the mallet through the air past Woodward 's face , and the magistrate flinched but did not retreat . " Gon na make me take it , huh ? Allrighty then , ai n't no skin off my bum . " " They 'll send someone else , " Matthew spoke up . " From Charles Town . They 'll send  --  " " Another fuckin ' magistrate ? Let ' em , then ! They keep sendin ' ' em , I 'll keep killin ' ' em ! " " They 'll send the militia , " he said , which was not nearly as fearsome as it sounded and was probably untrue anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murky light . " They 're gon na send the militia all the way from Charles Town ? But they did n't come lookin ' for Kingsbury or none of them others I laid to rest , did they ? " His grin began to twist into a snarl . He lifted the mallet up to a striking position . " I think I 'm gon na kill you first , you skinny son of a bi  --  " Woodward made his move . He whipped the waistcoat sharply across Shawcombe 's eyes and rushed the man , grabbing his wrist before the mallet could begin its descent . Shawcombe hollered a curse and Maude started shrieking , a sound that surely scared the wall-dwelling rats into flight . Shawcombe 's left hand came up  --  a fist now instead of a palm  --  and smacked into the magistrate 's chin . Woodward 's head rocked back , his eyes clouding , but he kept his grip on Shawcombe 's right wrist . " Abner ! Abner ! " the old woman was yelling . Woodward fired his own blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's cheekbone when Shawcombe saw it coming and twisted to avoid it . Then Shawcombe clamped his free hand around the magistrate 's throat and squeezed as they fought in the little room , one trying to get the mallet into action and the other intent on restraining it . They staggered back against the bed . Shawcombe 's eye caught a movement to his side and he looked in that direction a second before Matthew slammed him in the head with one of the magistrate 's boots he 'd picked up from the floor . Another swing of the boot struck Shawcombe on the shoulder , and now Matthew could see a glint of desperation in the man 's eyes . Shawcombe , who had realized that the magistrate was more formidable than he appeared , gave a roar like an enraged beast and drove his knee upward into Woodward 's genitals . Woodward cried out and doubled over , clutching himself . Suddenly the mallet was free . Shawcombe lifted it high , a two-handed grip , in preparation to bash in the back of the other man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boot was already swinging forward , and with every ounce of strength he could muster , Matthew hit Shawcombe across the bridge of the nose with its wooden heel . The noise of the blow was like an axeblade striking oak ; somewhere in it was the crunch of Shawcombe 's nose breaking . Shawcombe gave a strangled cry and stumbled backward , intent on grabbing at his wounded face instead of seeing the color of the magistrate 's brain . Matthew stepped forward to wrest the mallet away , but suddenly he was attacked by the shrieking old hag , who grabbed at his coat collar with one hand and with the other shoved the candleflames toward his eyes . Matthew reflexively struck at her , hitting her in the face , but he had to retreat to get away from her , and now Abner was coming into the room with his lantern and his pitchfork . " Kill ' em ! " Shawcombe whined , a nasal sound ; he 'd met the wall and slid down to the floor , his hands clamped across his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ochre light , was leaking between his fingers . " Abner ! Kill ' em both ! " The old man , rain dripping from his beard , lifted the pitchfork and stepped toward Woodward , who was still groaning and trying to straighten himself up . Matthew was aware of the open window behind him . His mind worked , faster than his body could react . He said , " Thou shalt not kill . " Abner stopped in his tracks . He blinked as if stunned . " What ? " " Thou shalt not kill , " Matthew repeated . " It 's in the Bible . You do know the Lord 's word , do n't you ? " " I ... the Lord 's word ? Yeah , I reckon I  --  " " Abner ! Goddamn it , kill ' em ! " Shawcombe bawled . " It 's in the Bible , is it not ? Mr. Woodward , would you go out the window , please ? " The magistrate had tears of pain streaming down his face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should move quickly . " Shit ! Lemme up ! " Shawcombe tried getting to his feet , but both eyes were already turning purplish and starting to swell . He had a harder time than he 'd expected finding his balance , and it yet eluded him . He sank back down to the floor . " Maude ! Do n't let ' em get out ! " " Gim me ' at damn pigsticka ! " Maude grabbed the pitchfork and tugged at it , but Abner resisted her . " The boy 's right , " Abner said ; his voice was calm , as if a great truth had been revealed to him . " It 's in the Bible . Thou shalt not kill . That 's the Lord 's word . " " Ya damn fool ! Give it ' ere ! " Maude tried , unsuccessfully , to wrench the pitchfork out of his hands . " Hurry , " Matthew said , as he helped the magistrate over the windowsill and out . Woodward fell into the mud like a flour sack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettin ' far ! " Shawcombe promised , his voice tight with pain . " We 'll hunt ya down ! " Matthew glanced back into the room to make sure Maude did n't have the pitchfork . Abner was still holding on to it , his face furrowed with thought . Matthew figured the old man would n't remain in that state of religious piety much longer , though ; he was as much of a murderer as the other two , and Matthew had only rolled a stone in his path . Before Matthew let go of the sill , he saw another figure standing in the doorway . It was the girl , her face pale , the dark and dirty hair hanging in her eyes . Her arms were clasped around herself , a protective gesture . He had no idea if she was as mad as the rest of them , or what would become of her ; he knew for certain , though , that she was beyond his help . " Go on and run like a dog ! " Shawcombe taunted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes becoming narrow , puffed slits . " If you 're thinkin ' to get that sword was in your wagon , it 's done been got ! Damn blade ai n't sharp enough to cut a fart ! So go on and see how far ya get ! " Matthew released the sill and jumped down into the mud beside Woodward , who was struggling to his feet . Maude began flailing Abner with curses , and Matthew knew they 'd better put as much distance between them and the tavern as they could before the pursuit started . " Can you run ? " he asked the magistrate . " Run ? " Woodward looked at him incredulously . " You might ask if I could crawl ! " " Whatever you can do , you 'd best do it , " Matthew said . " I think we should get into the woods , first thing . " " What about the horses and the wagon ? We 're not just going to leave them here ! " " There 's no time . I expect they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come at us with an axe or a musket  --  " " Say no more . " With an effort , Woodward began slogging toward the woods across the road from the tavern . Matthew followed close at his side , watchful in case he staggered . The lightning flashed , thunder clapped , and rain fell upon their heads . Before they reached the forest , Matthew looked back at the tavern but saw no one yet following . He hoped Shawcombe had lost  --  at least for the moment  --  the desire to rouse himself and come out in this storm ; he doubted if the old man and woman were very self-motivated without him . Probably Shawcombe was too busy dealing with his own pain to inflict it on anyone else . Matthew thought about going back for the horses , but he 'd never saddled and bridled a mount in his life and the situation was volatile . No , he decided , it was best to head into the forest and follow the road in the direction they 'd been going . " We left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the quagmire of mud and pine needles at the forest 's edge . " Everything ! My clothes , my wigs , my judicial robes ! Dear Christ , my waistcoat ! That animal has my waistcoat ! " " Yes , sir , " Matthew answered . " But he does n't have your life . " " And a sorry thing that will be , from this day forward ! Ahhhhh , that man almost made me a soprano ! " He peered into the utter darkness that lay ahead . " Where are we going ? " " Fount Royal . " " What ? " The magistrate faltered . " Has that man 's madness impressed you ? " " Fount Royal is at the end of the road , " Matthew said . " If we keep walking , we might be there in a few hours . " An optimistic appraisal , he thought . This swampy earth and the pelting rain would slow them considerably , but it would also hinder their pursuers . " We can return here with their militia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . " Woodward was silent . It was indeed their only choice . And if he could get his waistcoat back  --  and see Shawcombe kicking at the end of a noose  --  it would be worth a few hours of this vile indignity . He could not help thinking that once a man fell into the pit of disfavor with God , the hole was bottomless . He had no shoes , his balls were bruised and aching , his head was naked to the world , and his nightshirt was sopping and covered with mud . But at least they did both have their lives , which was more than he could say of Thymon Kingsbury . Execution is not one of my duties , he 'd told Shawcombe . Well , that just might have to be amended . He would come back here and get that waistcoat if it was the last thing he did on this earth . Matthew was moving a little faster than the magistrate , and he paused to wait for Woodward . In time , the night and the storm swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
