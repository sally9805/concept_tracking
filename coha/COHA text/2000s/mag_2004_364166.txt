The best way to figure out why something absolutely had to happen is to imagine what it would be like if it had happened in some other way . That is what David Gray is doing in a comfortable Geneva , Ill. , living room with six other men from his church . They are , as it were , brainstorming Jesus ' death . " What if God 's plan were that Jesus comes to earth , " asks Gray , " and he does these teachings and he talks nice . You know , ' Love your enemy ... ' And then he is taken away and not killed . Why in God 's plan did he have to suffer like this ? " <P> The other members of the men 's Bible study associated with St. Mark 's Episcopal Church in Geneva contemplate the question . <P> " God 's plan probably has to be more dramatic ? " suggests one . <P> " Right , " says another , briefly imagining God 's thinking . " ' You folks do n't get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> " One word I would add to this discussion , " says a third . " Obedience . Jesus was totally obedient . " <P> Gray chews all this over and comes to a conclusion . " It physically had to happen , " he says . " I 'm not sure I would have said that before I saw the movie . But now it 's much clearer to me . I ca n't say why he had to suffer the way he did . But Christ had to die . " <P> The movie , of course , is The Passion of the Christ , Mel Gibson 's version of Jesus ' final hours on earth  --  which , since it opened on Ash Wednesday , has been seen by more than 30 million people . It is now Holy Week , and across the country over the next seven days even more people will be talking about Christ 's Passion . In the U.S. alone , tens of millions will attend church and participate in services that relive the death and Resurrection of the Messiah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit has been further enhanced by the publication of The Glorious Appearing , the 12th book in the best-selling Left Behind series , in which Jesus returns in apocalyptic judgment . <P> But what will mark this Easter week as different for an even greater number of Christians  --  and perhaps deepen the nature of its observance a bit  --  will be the ongoing impact of The Passion of the Christ . In addition to attending church services , many will fill the plush pews at their local cinemas to absorb  --  some for the first time , others for the second or fifth  --  Gibson 's graphic celluloid sermon in parallel with their pastors ' talks . In the past six weeks the film has made $340 million . It has opened in about 350 additional theaters for Holy Week , but even so , there are no doubt locales where people will be turned away from full showings , particularly on Friday .
