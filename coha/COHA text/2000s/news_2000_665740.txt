<p> President Clinton has decided on a two-year , $1.2 billion aid program to help Colombia combat narcotrafficking , revitalize a moribund economy and carry out a series of judicial and other reforms , an administration official says . <p> The new program , fashioned by an interagency task force , was expected to be made public today , said the official , who spoke Monday only on condition of anonymity . <p> With coca production at record levels despite an ambitious eradication program , Colombia has quickly emerged as the No. 1 priority for the Clinton administration in Latin America . Assistance for the current fiscal year totals about $300 million . <p> Adding to the sense of urgency is the continuing failure of the Colombian government to make headway in its war against a leftist insurgency that often works in tandem with the country 's drug lords . <p> The aid proposal reflects the close ties the administration has maintained with Colombian President Andres Pastrana , who said in September the nation would need $3.5 billion in outside assistance to confront its myriad problems . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its struggle but they may have differences with the administration over how the money should be spent . <p> The GOP favors spending on counternarcotics activities while the administration prefers that the spending be spread out over a range of programs , consistent with the view of the Colombian government . <p> Pastrana believes no counternarcotics program is viable unless Colombian farmers are given the opportunity to produce alternatives to narcotics plants , such as coca . <p> Clinton 's proposal has funds earmarked for that purpose , the administration official said . <p> There also will be money for protection of human rights workers and the training of judges and prosecutors as part of an ambitious judicial reform program . Steps also will be taken to revitalize the country 's plummeting economy , now in its worst recession in decades . <p> The administration welcomed the accession of Pastrana in August 1998 after four years of unproductive ties when Ernesto Samper was president . He was stripped of his U.S. visa because of suspicions of involvement with narcotraffickers . <p> U.S. officials see Pastrana as a breath of fresh air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues as the drug war and the guerrilla insurgency during his 17 months in office .
