<p> Shelly Gerding had a dream , a secret and a decision to make . She graduates from Roswell High School next month and wants to start Berry College this fall . She 's a good student  --  but not a genius , as she puts it . And she 's no athlete , either . But she had her secret . If she could bear to tell it , she thought , it just might translate into financial aid . <p> She poured it into a short essay , then struggled for two weeks for the nerve to mail it in . <p> Judges on the North Fulton Council of PTAs ' scholarship committee read Shelly 's story with wet eyes and awarded her $3,000 . <p> In less than 300 words the 17-year-old had told a story about a child who loses both parents after a night of drunken violence . It 's a story almost none of her classmates have heard , a secret she is finally ready to reveal . <p> " I do n't know how to explain all that has happened since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try ; it is something I can no longer hold inside of me . I lost my mother at the age of 11 in a " car accident . " That 's what I like to call it . She was in a car , the passenger seat actually , my father was driving . They did n't hit anything , but she lost her life that night . " <p> Shelly 's father , James Gerding , is serving a 35 1/2-year sentence for second-degree murder , armed criminal action and driving while intoxicated . He told police his wife , Evelyn , fell out of their truck during an argument . But forensic investigators concluded she was beaten to death with a blunt tool , probably a tire iron . <p> " His story did n't wash , " said Detective Mike Yarbrough of the St. Charles County , Mo. , Sheriff 's Department . " He murdered her , plain and simple . " <p> Police found Evelyn 's body near an abandoned rock quarry . She was 44 . <p> Shelly moved here to live with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May 1997 . She arrived in time to finish eighth grade at Northwestern Middle School and began her freshman year at Roswell High School that fall . <p> When asked about her past , Shelly would tell a sparse truth : My mom died ; my dad lives in another state ; I live with my aunt . No lies , but no details . <p> More than 2,100 students surge through Roswell High School 's halls between classes . Shelly does n't like loud voices , does n't like crowds , and has to deal with both every day . She grabs a book and clutches it to her chest as she navigates the corridors like a salmon swimming upstream . <p> " I get claustrophobic , " she said . <p> Two years ago , she started flirting with the idea of attending Berry . She fell in love when she visited the campus a few months ago . <p> " It seems homey . No one 's going to be really crammed , " she said . " Everyone can have their own personal tree . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any silly little thing . It would only turn out into a complete fight or argument if they were both drinking . " <p> Shelly has a few good memories and a lot of bad ones . She likes to talk about the good ones . Her mother snapping photos at a chorus recital . Trick-or-treating with her dad . Visiting a friend 's farm and picking out two kittens  --  Screamer and Scratcher . <p> But the bad memories creep through her mind like ivy : She 's standing at the top of the staircase , 9 years old , crying for her parents to stop yelling . There 's a lull , then more yelling as her parents argue over who woke her . <p> The hollering keeps her up , so she retreats into a cabinet to hold her stuffed animals . Scrunched up tight , she falls asleep amid the toys , a cat curled up in her arms . <p> " My mom would call the cops when they would have their fights . After a while they got used to it . They 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He 'd walk out without handcuffs . It was something I dealt with . You get used to it after a while . Now I have a fear of arguments and loud voices . I just want to crawl back into a corner . " <p> " That night , which was a week before Thanksgiving , they were fighting about my half-brother ( my mother 's son ) . They were driving home from a night out at the bars , and well , how do I put this ? . . . They started drinking before they even left the house . I had a feeling that I would get when I knew that something bad was going to happen . What , I was unsure of . " <p> The night of Nov. 19 , 1995 , Shelly 's parents told her they were going to a gas station to buy cigarettes . <p> Her mother called about 10 p.m. , saying the store was closed and they were moving on . She told Shelly not to wait up . The next morning , Shelly went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedspread was neat . <p> Shelly , then 11 , assumed her parents had simply stayed out all night so she got herself ready for school . That afternoon , her mother was supposed to pick her up after school to go shopping . <p> Shelly waited for an hour , then caught a ride home . <p> Her grandmother , who was living with Shelly 's family , fixed dinner and put Shelly to bed . The next morning , her grandmother told Shelly she did n't have to go to school . <p> " My half brother came into my room and said my dad killed my mom . He said it with a straight face . I did n't want to cry , but I knew that was expected of me . So I did . " <p> " As far as I know , which is what my father told me , my mother opened the car door when it was moving about 40 miles per hour . At the court , the jury , I guess , thought that my father had pushed her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Shelly testified during the trial about her parents ' arguments . She had often seen her mother drunk , and had once seen her crash a bottle over her father 's head . She had n't seen her father strike her mother , though . <p> Shelly sat beside her aunt as the prosecutor showed photos of the clothes Shelly 's mother wore the night she died . They were stained with blood . The prosecutor showed pictures of her mother 's body . Shelly wrapped herself in her aunt 's arms and held tight . <p> Police found James Gerding with his wife 's body the night she was killed . He was sobbing and trying to resuscitate her . <p> " They had been out on a casino boat , drinking and gambling , " Detective Yarbrough said . " His story was , she jumped out of the truck and he may have run over her . The medical examiner said nay , nay . It did n't hold up . " <p> Yarbrough said police had been called out to the Gerdings ' home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little girl . " She was about 10 or 11 then , right ? " <p> " I do n't know who to believe , or what to believe . " <p> Shelly sounds sympathetic to her dad at times , but she is also irritated at what she calls his refusal to accept responsibility for her mother 's death . " He keeps saying it 's not his fault . " <p> She sounds angrier at her mother . Sometimes , with the car windows rolled up and the radio loud , she yells at her . <p> " Sometimes I 'll blame her for something . I feel like if she was here , I would n't have to worry about college money . But then , maybe I would . And I would n't get to go to Berry because I would be in St. Louis . <p> " Sometimes I talk . But when I talk I want to hear something back . I talk to my cat . She responds to me . Then she 'll swat at me . " <p> Shelly calls her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to have children when she grows up and marries . She is sure she will be a good mother . <p> " I 'm going to get up before my kid in the morning . I 'm going to cook him breakfast . I 'll pack the lunch . I 'll let them spend the night . I 've learned from my mom 's mistakes . I 'm going to be what I wanted my mom to be . " <p> " I was sent to live with my grandmother and my father 's sister down here in Georgia . " <p> Suzanne Rosenwasser is Shelly 's English teacher . These days it seems she and Shelly are alone in the eye of Hurricane Senioritis . <p> " She is certainly not the cynic that her peers can be , " Rosenwasser said . " She 's not lazy . " <p> She sees both leadership and sensitivity in Shelly . <p> " You 're aware immediately that she is vulnerable , " Rosenwasser said . " Not in the sense that she wounds easily , but in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's risen from the ashes . It 's very hard to be the new kid at Roswell and not be driving the new SUV , wearing all the new clothes . She does it with dignity . I 'm sure most kids at Roswell High School are n't aware of the situation she 's in . " <p> Rosenwasser is right . Few of Shelly 's friends know her whole story . She does n't want people to look at her funny or to pity her . But she is usually happy . She smiles when her boyfriend remembers to buy prom tickets without being reminded or when she thinks about going to her cousin 's graduation . All causes for cheer . <p> One of her two part-time jobs is at Ashley Avery 's Collectables in North Point Mall . It 's an elegant store filled with luminous porcelain and crystal figurines . Shelly 's favorite is a $330 Lladro piece called " Happy Anniversary . " It 's a man in a tuxedo gazing lovingly into his sweetheart 's eyes . The woman swoons in a strapless pink sheath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then carefully replaces it on its glass shelf . She finds such joy in this symbol of what she missed growing up . <p> " It 's so romantic . You see couples holding hands , but nothing this peaceful . I never saw my parents like that . " <p> " I promised myself that I would never end up like them . " <p> Rise Volkmar has three children of her own , but she welcomed Shelly into her home four years ago . She put her life on hold so her niece could resume her childhood . <p> " I give her so much credit for not going down the wrong path , " Volkmar said . <p> Shelly has already signed up to work 15 hours a week on Berry 's campus . <p> " A lot of kids get cars when they 're 16 , and then get new cars when they graduate , " said Shelly , who drives a 1990 Ford Taurus that belonged to her grandmother . " I know I 'm better off . I know how to work for things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Berry costs about $17,000 a year . Shelly has the $3,000 PTA scholarship and a little money her mother left her , but nowhere near enough to pay for school . Two of Volkmar 's children have graduated from college , and she has one more on the way . There 's not a lot for Shelly . <p> " We figured out that I can pay for it for one year , " Shelly said . " Kind of . Without books . Without food . " <p> The other day , she was filling out an application for the Craig Allyn Wofford Scholarship offered by Berry . It , too , is need-based . She included just an abbreviated version of her story in the essay , but is no longer afraid to talk about her past . <p> " I was like , OK , I ca n't keep this inside , " she said . " I am who I am because of my background and my parents and everything . I 've been through so much and I 'm strong . I believe I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shelly Gerding finds a strange fascination in one particular porcelain figurine on sale at the collectibles shop where the 17-year-old works after classes at Roswell High School . It features a couple forever entwined in a romantic embrace , and , as Shelly puts it , " I never saw my parents like that .
