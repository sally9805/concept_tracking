The hunters stalked their prey from the sky and in the shadows , armed with instruments of death and waiting for Osama bin Laden to reveal himself . Above the gnarled ridges outside the besieged cities of Jalalabad and Kandahar , U.S. warplanes unloaded laser-guided Maverick missiles and 5,000-lb. bunker busters to collapse limestone redoubts and bury anyone taking cover inside . Members of the U.S. Army 's clandestine 800-man Delta Force tracked likely bin Laden hideouts , equipped with night-vision goggles and stun grenades , in case they had to creep inside the mountains , and laser pointers , in the hope that they could get warplanes to do the dirty , risky work . Bands of local Afghan fighters  --  whether driven by the desire to rid their country of bin Laden or win the $25 million bounty the U.S. had placed on his head  --  joined U.S. special-operations forces in the pursuit . Their orders were to shoot to kill . As one Army officer told TIME , " We wo n't ask him if he wants to surrender . " <P> No one expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhunt inside Afghanistan , U.S. commanders surmised that bin Laden  --  like the men he has dispatched on his errands of suicidal terror  --  would rather endure a fiery death than be captured by the infidels . He has reportedly instructed his closest aides , including his son , to give him the glory of martyrdom and shoot him if the Americans came knocking . <P> The swift , shocking transformation of Afghanistan 's map last week  --  as rebel forces seized control of at least two-thirds of the country from the Taliban  --  made bin Laden 's demise seem imminent , even if the Pentagon could not say precisely where he was . With Taliban forces ditching their guns and switching sides by the thousands , American commandos spent last week picking up bin Laden 's scent  --  and nudging the six-week conflict toward a decisive climax . The Taliban faced devastation in its southern strongholds , and that shrank bin Laden 's theater of operation . Pashtun operatives showered Western and Pakistani intelligence agents with information about bin Laden 's hideouts . Pakistani officials told TIME that U.S. forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence agents , have zeroed in on the Tora Bora region near Jalalabad , where bin Laden was thought to have sought the protection of the 1,500 Arab fighters left stranded there by the retreating Taliban . With hunters closing in , he was said to be moving nightly among caves in the honeycombed mountains stretching from Jalalabad to the northern half of the Uruzgan province . American F-15Es , unmanned Predator drones and commando ground troops killed scores of Taliban and al-Qaeda lieutenants , including bin Laden deputy Mohammed Atef , the reputed architect of the Sept. 11 attacks . <P> The anti-Taliban storm has left the country in a state of " maximum turmoil , " as military strategists call it  --  the ideal environment for American forces to put bin Laden on the run . A huge , nagging fear was that bin Laden would disappear inside Afghanistan , dug in so deep that he could lead the U.S. forces on a long , futile chase . But allied officials exuded more confidence than ever before that they knew where  --  and how  --  to get him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
