The cousins made a rough crossing , they 'd have said , if they had thought to complain . They mentioned but did n't lament the time in the air , the late arrival at De Gaulle , the bus ride to catch the train at the Gare Montparnasse , or the long wait for the Trs Grand Vitesse to Bordeaux . They did joke about the man in the car rental agency at the Bordeaux terminal who spoke no English and who resented that they spoke some French . He cost them a half an hour of futile searching for the car he pretended to direct them toward , nearly shouting his exasperation : " Les voitures , ils restent l , droit-l , monsieur ! L ! " <p> Eleanor could imagine them , with their several heavy bags , their sacks from the duty-free , their great , damp slabs and mounds of muscle and fat shifting and trembling as they panted in and about the station and , finally , through the darkness of the garage beneath it where the rentals , les voitures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its awful accent and its wonderful vocabulary , as he breathlessly sought to entertain the traveling salesman who , speaking French with native fluency and English with a transatlantic businessman 's ease , had offered to lead them to their car . <p> Now Eugene sat at the table in the kitchen of the rental house , which he called , quite properly , a gte . They had never met , and her husband had never spoken of these enormous creatures who , it seemed , were kin . Eugene had embraced her on arriving in their sporty convertible , climbing out from behind the wheel with slow , laborious motions to hold her neck in a yoke of moist , thick fingers , kissing her head with the greatest delicacy until Bertha had pulled her away to smother Eleanor 's bowed face in those enormous breasts that shifted as if they were independent creatures trapped beneath the baggy tan traveling dress she matched with tan strap pumps and a tan leather handbag that looked as though it were weighted with stones . <p> " No la , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the cousin of Eleanor 's dead husband chanted . " The fellow knew we 'd never find them . The Sino-French gentleman , a manufacturer 's agent for plastics , if you can believe it , unless he meant explosive plastique , now that you mention it , finally showed us where to go . He 'd been there before , of course , and he was waiting in the corner of the rental office with that polite tranquility of theirs- " <p> " Not that my dear husband wishes to be mistaken for a racialist , " Bertha warned . <p> Eugene smiled damply at the table in the kitchen they had planned , she and Sid , to use during the rest of June and all of July . While Madame Panifiette , their landlady , took the advice of her husband and several friends in the area to consider whetherhere she had made a number of faces involving downturned lips , raised brows , and a half a shake of the head-given the legalities involved , she could release Eleanor from the remainder , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Eleanor had said to the tiny Madame Panifiette , with her alabaster complexion , in front of Eugene and Bertha , " You never liked me , did you ? " <p> " Well , now , " Bertha had said , in sweet , slippery syllables , " we do n't want to necessarily accuse anyone of anything , do we ? " <p> Between them , Bertha and Eugene weighed seven hundred and fifty pounds , Eleanor would have bet . On a better day , she 'd have guessed it at six-fifty . But this was only a few days after Sid had looked up from the little corner table on which he leaned toward his white , lined pad with his fine-point fountain pen . She had been sitting at the pine dining table in the tile-paneled kitchen , writing postcards home at maybe eight in the morning . She looked up as Sid did . They caught each other 's eyes . She thought he was going to say something rueful about his work . She was ready to smile and cluck and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were enjoying . But it stopped , inside his eyes , and they went out . He fell sideways from his chair . She went to him , she called to him , she blew her breath past his teeth and felt it going nowhere except back up at her mouth . That night , after following the ambulance to the regional hospital and after talking to a man from the gendarmerie who seemed too young to drive , much less take charge of her husband 's death , she used Sid 's address book and her own to call home and speak to eight or nine people . She did not call her daughter , Margo , and every day that she failed to , it seemed like a more impossible task . It was an overdue account , accruing a terrible interest . Of the people she did call , Sid 's cousins , whom she 'd never met , insisted that they come to her . They flew from Baltimore to Roissy-Charles de Gaulle , they took the train to Bordeaux , and they navigated their rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southwestern France , and here they were , managing , among other elements , her grief . Over some days , the details of their journey emerged , and she came to think of them as her big , fat heroes . <p> They were probably sixty , she thought . Bertha was as tall as Eugene , with beefy shoulders and thick , rounded arms . She dyed her hair black as if to match it to the hair of her shaved mustache . She wore either dresses or skirts with matching tops , nothing tucked in , which was a vanity that Eleanor found moving . She could see the breadth of Bertha 's vast thighs as she walked briskly , in dressy high heels , through the echoing , cool , white or white-and-rose tiles of the floors and walls of the gte . She " straightened things up , " she said . " Not that it is n't as neat as a pin . But one tries , " she said , " to help . The best , the most useful help , they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eugene , who ran a rare-books business in Baltimore , on one of the streets near the revived waterfront area , looked every day at the few French books Madame Panifiette had supplied , as well as the couple of stacks that had taken up too much of the space in Sid and Eleanor 's rolling duffel cases . When he was n't reading in books he clearly did n't like , or looking at titles he did n't want to open , Eugene spoke on the telephone , using his credit card , to arrange in his blatting but quite correct French for the passage home of three vertical Americans and one who would , as soon as his body was released by the authorities , travel prone . <p> " Assuming , " Eleanor told him as he hung up and sighed , " that Fifi LaPue over there lets me out of the lease . She had a little hankering for Sid , by the way , would have been my bet . What the drug people call a jones ? Though I do n't know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps , then , she 'll be glad to see you go , now that you 're on your own . I am so sorry , " he said . " Forgive me . Sidney- " <p> Eleanor nodded . She did n't know what else to do with her face , so she put her hands over it . Sidney and I , she nearly said to his cousin , would not have made it from the June we are in to the start of autumn . They 'd been a middle-aged couple in a second marriage for each that was going as sour as the wine their landlady 's husband produced in what was little more than a very large , old stone garage . Now Eleanor was a middle-aged widow whose husband had died of what the very sweet young doctor , who smelled of a citrus soap Eleanor had thought clean and sexy at once , called une attaque-a stroke . <p> Then the doctor had added , not hesitantly at all , for she was a sophisticated woman of France , after all , " Les @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Do you know this word of ours for , er , the Negroes , madame ? " <p> Eleanor took a deep breath in order to shout at her , to screech , she realized , about her experience as a teacher of French at the sixth snootiest prep school for girls in the City of New York . She was going to scream in impeccable French . But the woman 's kind , tired light green eyes , her obvious concern for the dead man 's wife , silenced her . She touched the doctor 's forearm with the fingers of her right hand , and she nodded . <p> She let her breath out , and she said , " D'accord . " <p> " Eh , bien , " the doctor said . " Donc . Les ngres , ils sont trs vulnrables des attaques . Je regrette , madame . " <p> It had seemed to her before he died , and it seemed to her afterward , that they had remained in love . The sorriest part , she was beginning to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live , together or alone . And a desire to live , something beyond the animal drive to not be killed off , she had reluctantly come to think , was the most necessary and most elusive of feelings . Thinking of the size of Sid 's mistake and hers in marrying , she wondered if Eugene suspected something of the great error in which Sidney and she had courted and married and traveled abroad . Here he was , because he thought it right to come to the aid of his nephew 's white wife , this gentle , vast , and elegant pearshaped cousin from Baltimore , sweating through his white duck trousers and his dark blue long-sleeved shirt , waving his white , broad-brimmed straw hat as a fan between them while they sat at the kitchen table and checked their little list of what to do after a husband 's death in a rural rental house among the rows of the Panifiettes ' sauvignon blanc vines at the end of a very warm June . She knew that Bertha 's whiteness could be all or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairless cafe-au-lait head shone from the heat , and she thought she could feel it , like his decency , radiate from him across the yard or so of polished pine . <p> " I 'm sorry the weather 's so uncomfortable , " Eleanor said . " And I 'm so glad you 're here , you and Bertha , that I feel treacherous about my relief-on account of your discomfort . But thank goodness . " <p> " You 're a cousin . A cousin-in-law . I do not know what you are , in legal definitions , Eleanor . You are our family . If you want to be . If you do , then you are . If you do n't , consider us a very , very large pain in the ass until we see you safely home . " <p> She took his beefy , moist hand , the one that rested on the table near his coffee cup , and she set it against the side of her head . <p> " Dear girl , " he said . <p> Bertha walked in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , whether it was to lift a cup of coffee or cross a room . Eleanor could imagine them as they somehow , helping each other quite cordially , made their slow , breathless way up the stairs of the Trs Grand Vitesse and stowed the bags at the end of the first-class carriage . She could imagine them murmuring to one another- " Are you all right , dear ? If you 'd give me your hand ... " - and could envision them as they faced each other across the little table of their compartment , stomachs folded doughily over the table 's edge , great arms flattening on its top , arranging bottles of Evian and sandwiches , wedges of cheese , perhaps , and chunks of fruit that Eugene cut for them with a folding wooden-handled picnic knife while the train gathered speed . She saw his vast hands manage with delicacy the division of a Cavaillon melon or a crescent of brie , saw hers distribute napkins and plastic cups . <p> " I have just been having another word with Madame Panifiette , " Bertha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her smile might have excused Madame or indicted her own French , but it was kind , somehow . " She expects to ' achieve a resolution ' quite rapidly . " <p> " I 'll bet you money , " Eleanor said , " that it costs us extra money . " <p> " I will expect her to do better on our behalf , " Eugene said , with a little steel in his voice . " But some money might pleasantly change the equation . I could see that . " <p> Bertha asked , " Did Eugene tell you that we were cooking tonight ? " <p> Eleanor shook her head . <p> " Well , we 're cooking , " Bertha said , " so you might prepare yourself . " <p> " Is that a stressful situation ? " <p> " No , dear , " Eugene said . " It 's noisy , a little , and sometimes quite messy , but I would n't call it stressful . You are in one of the superb culinary districts of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great wine center , as I 'm sure you know . We 're off to shop , and then , when we return with food and drink , you are invited to a meal prepared by relatives . Are we your in-laws ? " <p> Eleanor shrugged . She tried to smile brightly . <p> " Outlaws , then , " Bertha said , and she laughed like a girl , though her eyes seemed sad as they slid toward Eleanor and then away . <p> " Outlaws it will be , " Eugene said . <p> Begging her pardon for seeming intrusive , they moved about the room , opening cupboards and inspecting the refrigerator , each naming items for a list while Eugene wrote down , on one of Sid 's green-lined white legal pads , what they would need to buy at the open-air stalls in the square of St. Macaire and at the supermarket in Langon . <p> Eleanor , who was tall and broad-shouldered and , according to Sid , " the slightly repressed all-American lifeguard at the country club pool , " was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who suddenly , it seemed , was in graduate school for the study of some kind of cell physiology that her father , a medical doctor , seemed to understand , while Eleanor could only decipher the meaning of " cell " and " physiology " without formulating an intelligent sentence that used both words . She was remembering how , early that winter , Margo had come home from Madison , Wisconsin , to Eleanor 's place on West 9th Street to stay the night and register her opinion about Sid and her mother before spending the weekend at their old apartment , now her father 's , uptown . <p> She said , " Mother , for Christ 's sake . Have an affair . It 's an itch , so scratch it . Get over the thrill of it . Then learn how to live alone like the rest of us , for Christ 's sake . " <p> " And have you considered that it could possibly be more than sex ? " <p> " When a forty-five-year-old divorced white woman gets a jones for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of which she happened to read before he picked her up at the Metropolitan Museum show of those Vienna Whoevers who did the highly sexualized paintings ? Ma : duh-uh . " <p> " I do n't know where to begin , " Eleanor had said . She remembered stumping back and forth on the broad , painted planks of her little Village living room . " I do n't know whether to shout terrible things about your not knowing the Vienna secession , or calling their paintings ' sexualized , ' like you 're the Dean of Correctness at a second-rate college , or portraying me as this overstimulated matron who just wants to get laid by the nearest black man , who , like all the rest of them , you know , you know , is a phallic engine who can not stay away from dumb and oversexed white women . Margo : duh-uh . How could you ? And why are you so lonely , handing out that living-alone stuff ? And since whenever do you say I have a jones ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything I ca n't forgive , Mother . " <p> Margo had called her Mother since the divorce , which they had conducted like a small war while their civilian casualty was in the eleventh grade . Eleanor said , " Margo ? Are you really that alone ? Are you saying that / am ? Are you accusing me of being in despair ? How desperate do you think I am ? " <p> " How much do you weigh , Mother ? " <p> " How much- " <p> " How much do you weigh ? " <p> " One thirty-three . " <p> " I thought it was , like , a hundred and forty-five ? " <p> " No comment . " <p> " Right . So I 'd call you roughly a hundred and forty-five pounds of desperate . That 's how desperate I think you are . " <p> Margo sat in silence then and watched her wander in the living room , from the wall of bookshelves to the long sofa to one of the windows onto pth Street . Finally , Eleanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've been holding my breath . I 've gotten so strung out by you , I forgot to breathe . " <p> " Then you know the principle of blowing dope . Hold it and hold it and then let it go . I could roll us a joint . " <p> " Of marijuana ? " <p> " What did you think it involved , Mother ? " <p> " I do n't want to know . " <p> " All right . " <p> " Do you smoke it a lot ? " <p> Margo looked at her with the pity of the young . Eleanor had seen it on her students ' faces . That it was undisguised made it cruel , as if they had never considered the possibility of an elder understanding the gulf between them . You decayed before their eyes , it said , and you did n't know how close to dead you were . <p> " I think you 're learning to value yourself is all , " Eleanor had said when they told each other good night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " And do you ? " <p> " Do I what ? " <p> " Mother , do you value yourself ? " <p> " Of course . And I know that Sid values me . Oh , " Eleanor had said , " not a great answer , is it ? " <p> " You 're still learning , too . " <p> " Life is long , " Eleanor remembered telling her . <p> " It better be , " Margo had said , about to go inside the guest room , " because you are one slow learner . " <p> Which apparently was true , Eleanor thought as , in the French rental , Sid 's great cousins prepared to drive into St. Macaire to purchase butter and cream and duck breasts and two kinds of mushrooms . " We can bake in those little ramekins instead of metal molds , " he said . " Absolutely no harm done . And that 's a reminder , " he instructed Bertha , " about milk for the timbales . We can not forget the milk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Yes , I am , " he said . He told Eleanor , " The preparation of food , you will not be surprised to learn , excites me . I get forgetful . " <p> " He can also be dictatorial and quite like a master chef-decidedly cruel , " Bertha said , smiling . " It gets quite dangerous when we cook . " <p> " The danger , " Eugene chanted , as if from memory , " lies in running short of reliable duck confit , not in any slightly bruised feelings among the sous-chefs . " <p> " Who said that ? " Bertha asked . <p> " I did , of course . " <p> " You can see , " she told Eleanor , " he grows brutal . " <p> There was a rustling of linen clothing , a seizing of lists , and a counting of currency , and then they were off in their black convertible , down the stony drive to turn left onto the little connector road , then right onto the paved secondary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheds that sheltered stainlesssteel storage tanks and the descent into St. Macaire with its ramparts and its small , plain cathedral , and its narrow streets . She thought for a moment of the cousins as they loomed over the small , taut French while they inspected the wares of the seller of Basque sausages and cheeses , or the local man so proud of his harsh Armagnac , and the butcher who always seemed to sneer over his duck legs , his unplucked chickens , his thick loins of pork . She could hear their murmurs to each other and their charmed , polite replies . <p> In the master bedroom , which like the dining area opened into the vineyard , she moved folded clothing about and tried to pack . There were two large bags and two small ones for carrying books and bottles of water onto the plane ; they had n't brought more than thin summer clothing and a cotton sweater apiece for a cool night , but there seemed to her to be too little room in their luggage . It felt important that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eventually , she would give it all away in New York . For now , though , she wanted to bring him home with everything he 'd carried abroad . <p> Did that include her ? She wondered if they would have returned together , assuming the small matter of his not having died of an explosion of blood in the brain . <p> " Probably , " she said to the chugging of insects outside , the slow droning of fat bees in the waist-high pots of rosemary next to the house . <p> " Of course , " she said . <p> Looking at the herbs and thinking of the cousins at their listmaking , she thought of the preparation of food . She remembered the first formal date with Sid , who had taken her for dinner to Jarnac , the restaurant in the West Village . He had insisted that they order the cassoulet , which was better , he said , than the cassoulet with white beans and duck and pork sausage that he had eaten in the Fifth Arrondissement of Paris the previous year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the kitchen while they ate , and she circulated through the small room . She and Sid embraced , she patted Eleanor on the shoulder , and she moved on . <p> " The chef , " Sid said . <p> " I ca n't help it , " she told him . " I 'm impressed . " <p> " That was the idea . " <p> " It was ? " <p> " Oh , yes . You 're who I 'm determined to impress . " <p> His thin face , which she thought had as many muscles in it as an athlete 's arm , was a little darker , with a little more putty color , she thought now , than Eugene 's . Sid kept his coarse hair short , and she had enjoyed inspecting the beautiful shape of his head . She could imagine a mother holding her hand around the back of that head . She could imagine her own hand there . He saw her speculating , and he suddenly grinned , a big and boyish happy smile . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Although I suspect you can figure it out . " <p> " I hope so , " he said . <p> " I 'm considering matters , " she said . " So tell me something . " <p> " About what ? " <p> " About anything besides me . Tell me something about your work . " <p> " You said you know my work . Now I 'm disappointed . " <p> " What you are is like a boy about it . " <p> " I 'm like a boy about everything else , too , " he said . <p> " Never mind . Tell me about what you do . I read the one about the women who robbed banks . Very cool , as my daughter might say . A bunch of right-on women , she 'd say , except for the part about shooting people . Your detective cries . People seem to like that . " <p> " Margo . Your daughter . " <p> " Yes , Margo . So what are you working on now ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned any relative except his mother . He had certainly never referred to his cousins , the vast Caucasian Bertha , and Eugene , the giant brown purveyor of rare books who would return chirping to the house to prepare something involving magret de canard in order to nourish the widow . And here was the widow , trying to fit too many clothes into too few cubic inches of luggage that , a couple of weeks ago , had accommodated everything . <p> Eleanor slept among the stacks of neatly folded undershorts and T-shirts and olive-green cargo pants and the socks she had bought him at Brooks Brothers . She had been frightened while she slept . She had awakened herself by calling out , had looked about the room and closed her eyes and gone to sleep again . Now her mouth was gummy and foul , her face felt greasy , her left hand hurt from clenching it . She showered but put on the same clothing she 'd worn-khaki shorts , a wrinkled white camp shirt . She brushed her teeth and worked her hair into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she drank iced spring water while watching the sun hang huge and orange over the hills at the far edge of the grape vines cultivated by Monsieur and Madame Panifiette . The sun appeared not to move , though the insects chirred louder , she thought , and the bees worked harder now , and the hills began to go dark , almost as if they were a silhouette , even though the brilliant orange sun appeared to be directly over them . You would think it would light them up , she thought . <p> " Stand by , Eleanor , " Eugene called . She heard the throbbing of the engine of their Saab , and then she heard the slamming of doors , the rustling of plastic sacks , and the panting of very fat people moving across the hot slate walk at the back of the house . <p> She and Sid had not slept together during the week before he died . They had agreed , though they 'd said nothing aloud , to continue to sleep in the same bed , to kiss each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shower to their bedroom , to use the toilet without hesitation or shame , and to in every other way manifest their intimacy . The making love had stopped as though a mechanism had broken without any other symptoms . They had malfunctioned without a fight , only slightly acknowledging the increment of tension between them . Sid was making some progress with the book , his fourth , about a black detective of the upper middle class who solved crimes out of his affection for the victims , but never quite learned how to love the woman who , by the end of each book , loved him . <p> On the night of her learning about the breaking down , they lay in the dark in bed , he in pajama bottoms and she in sleeping shorts and a sleeveless , scoop-necked top , not touching , at the start of their sleeping this way every night . <p> " I keep wondering , " she said . " I mean , about how , where you are-at the start of it-you could go off to France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that depends on being in New York , where your people are- " <p> " My people ? " <p> " Now , you know what I mean . Your characters . You could n't have meant-you did n't think that I meant anything about race . " <p> " No , El , of course not . " <p> " It does n't sound like us , " she said , " talking that way . I mean , making that kind of mistake about each other . " <p> " No . " <p> " We do n't do that . " <p> He shifted . He sighed . " We surely did n't used to , " he said . He teetered on his side , and then rolled onto his back again . " We did n't . We must n't . " He turned toward her and kissed her upper arm , letting his teeth gently close on her flesh . <p> " You 're trying to turn me on , " she said . <p> " I am . " <p> " So that-so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " <p> " It 's a part of the argument , then ? " <p> " We are n't having one . " <p> " What are we having ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " A power struggle , " she said . <p> " El , come on . " <p> " Well , I 'm not hard to get , " she said . <p> " That 's not what I meant . " <p> " I do n't know quite what you meant , " she said . " But I do think we 're a little old to be wasting our time on so much talk about what we are n't doing when what we could be doing is making each other happy . " <p> He lay beside her , he did n't move , and the orange sun hung in the early nighttime sky . <p> " Except we are n't , " she said . " Am I guessing it right ? Happy , I mean . I mean , we 're not happy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioned in terms of language carefully chosen , and it was as if neither spoke the other 's native tongue . But the attitude of his body , his distance though he lay so close , his silence , now cut through the words they did n't or could n't select . It 's as simple as that , she thought . We are not . " What we 've been doing , maybe , " she said , " has been hoping . Maybe what we did was mostly hope . " <p> " Mostly hope , " he said . " Nothing ignoble in that . " <p> " We tried . " <p> He said , " We did our best . " <p> " Oh , Sid , " she said . <p> After a while , he said , " That 's right . Oh . " <p> And finally , she had returned his kiss , on the hard curve of the top of his shoulder , letting her lips come away slowly from his bronze-tan skin that always smelled to her like spices-and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and really did n't know one from the other : mace and cloves and nutmeg-because it seemed likely , she thought , before she turned over to face away from Sid and from the enormous , ragged sun , that they had just kissed goodbye . <p> Bertha and Eugene cooked , and they did their best to entertain her . They made drinks of Campari and soda over ice , and Eugene warbled bad renditions of tragic French arias while Bertha complained about the mysteries of the stove mechanisms . <p> " I am using dried crpes , " she told Eleanor , " along with chopped shallots and milk and no more than one half a cup of heavy cream to make a kind of gteau of mushrooms . They 're really called timbales . You know the term ? After we combine over heat , we 'll bake . You 'll find it echoed in the heavy cream , the port , and the shallots of the woodland sauce that my brother , the fascist chef , is coercing together for what will , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ? " <p> Eugene was gliding from the sink to the table to the stove , wiping at his sweaty forehead with a dishtowel hung about his neck . The evening breezes came in over the grapes while the air of the kitchen took on the aroma of the reducing canned chicken stock he apologized for using . " We bought it at the hypermarch outside Langon , " he said . " It 's a travesty , of course , but there has n't been time to make real stock . And we had better hope , by the way , that the co-fascist to my left " - and here Bertha actually performed a half a bow , her huge breasts falling against her dress- " knows that I require some of those crpes for my sauce . And , darling , " he said to her , " can you scoop me five tablespoons of butter ? " <p> She said , " Eleanor , would you mind awfully grating some nutmeg ? " <p> Eleanor said , " Why ? " <p> Eugene stopped washing parsley at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips and chopped crpes with a knife in one hand and a tub of butter in the other , paused , then turned to Eleanor , looked at her face , and said , " An unpleasant association ? " <p> She almost spoke , but only shook her head . <p> " It 's hardly necessary , dear , " Bertha said . <p> Eugene danced , immense over his relatively narrow , small feet , toward the table where she sat . " I must make you another Campari-soda , " he said . <p> " No , " she said . " No , thank you . " <p> " Some of the dinner wine ? If you know me , then you know I brought enough . I have Chateau St.-Georges-Cte-Pavie , which is a St. Emilion from nearly up the road . It 's supposed to be very fleshy and full of blackberries . It 's breathing on the counter , let me pour you a glass . " <p> " I can grate the nutmeg , " she told him . " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of wine , " he said . " And that 's all right . " <p> She held her palm out , and Bertha deposited the little tin grater with its small compartment that held the nuts . Eleanor leaned to sniff at the compartment . That was the smell of nutmeg . She said , " I wonder if you could excuse me ? " <p> " Dear girl , " Eugene said , " it 's all too , somehow , celebratory , is n't it ? We were afraid it might feel that way . Although one could celebrate Sidney . Perhaps one ought to , even . My brother 's boy . And are n't genes so treacherous ? Arthur , my brother , also died too young . And he was healthy .

He was more like a brother to me than Arthur , now that you mention it , who was , if you 'll forgive the psychology , a little bit more of a father , if you can believe it , as we got older . So maybe the meal 's for him . But it 's also for you , Eleanor , because Sidney loved you and you loved him . God bless you both . " <p> Bertha said , " She 's all done in , Eugene .

" <p> Bertha insisted on shepherding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned to kiss the air beside her face , around the corner , and down the short corridor that separated her bedroom and Sid 's from the room in which the cousins slept . She smelled the nutmeg , she believed . And she smelled Bertha 's heated skin , and a floral talc , and the astringency of a deodorant . Bertha held a vast , round , heavy arm about Eleanor 's shoulder , and she murmured to her , making noises but not whole words , little cooing sounds of encouragement , as she saw her through the bedroom door . Inside the bedroom , as she lay on the bed beside the open French doors , Eleanor heard them moving across the tiled floor of the kitchen , heard the sputtering of sauted food , the clatter of implements against crockery and pots , the thump of the oven door , the gurgle of liquids measured out . It all calmed her , and she let herself listen to the sounds of their cooking as , when she was a child , she heard , from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up in the kitchen at the end of a dinner party , her father 's voice tired and grainy and deep , her mother 's voice rich with satisfaction as she gossiped about her guests . <p> Eleanor woke to the sweet smell of grapes outside the bedroom , and the creamy , thick odor of the chalky soil in which they grew . Over those smells lay the dark richness of roasted vegetables and seared , sauced duck . She was lying on Sid 's side of the bed , among his scattered clothes , closer to the open doors onto the fields , in the darkness of a cloudy sky lit coldly now by the pale , small moon . It would rain in the morning , she thought , and the day would be humid . Eugene and Bertha would be uncomfortable in high humidity , and they would soak through their traveling clothes . They would suffer , and so might she , she thought , but none of them would look up , like Sid , and then , like a lamp extinguished , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , passing the closed door to the silent extra bedroom . A bottle half filled with the St.-Georges-Ctes-Pavie glowed in the low light the cousins had left on . She tugged at the cork and poured some into a kitchen tumbler . In the refrigerator she found sliced duck wrapped in plastic , and she sat at the table and ate . The wine was fruity and rich , and the taste of the duck made her hungry for more . But when she thought of the smell of nutmeg , although she could n't make out its taste in the duck , she removed the partly chewed meat from her mouth and threw it into the garbage pail under the sink . She took a swig of St. Emilion and spat it down into the drain . <p> Walking past the great pot of rosemary , and among lavender bushes , she slowly carried her wine down a row of grapevines . Something flew close to her head , but when she looked up she saw only the rows of cloud , like the serried layers of flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . She squatted , suddenly , and coughed , waiting to be sick . Nothing happened , though . It was as if they had eaten the corpse , she told herself , and she gagged again . But nothing more happened except a strangled cough , and she turned from what she thought of as her theatrics , sipped at the tumbler , and then walked the short distance back to the French doors of the bedroom , where she sat cross-legged on their bed and emptied her glass and thought of the sorry sweetness of their confession to each other that , at barely their beginning , they were failed . <p> A night bird at the far edge of the grape vines called , another answered , and then she heard Bertha 's rich voice . It had made a kind of whinny in the bedroom across the corridor . She moved from the bed without thinking , and she crouched at her closed door . Breathing raggedly , shallowly , she pressed the empty glass to the door and her ear to the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bedsprings in the extra room . She heard the shuffle and brush of bedclothes , and she heard their skin . They were probably running with sweat , she thought . They were naked and their bodies were wet and they were making love . She had never thought of them this way . She had considered them delicate of feeling , gentle of motive , bound inside themselves by their fat and the difficulty with which such large creatures moved , no matter how graceful they might appear . But now she heard them whisper with pleasure , she heard the smack of lolloping , floppy skin , the suction of their flesh as they moved together and apart and then together again . <p> Eugene said , low , " Oh , for God 's sake , my dearest girl . " <p> Bertha made a sound of pleasure at her wickedness . <p> " God , " he said . <p> She thought of the hundreds of pounds of flesh that shifted and slid , of the way a mounded stomach was stuck by fluid and friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was excited by what she heard , but she was also suddenly aware that what she ached with now was not the grief of this morning or of the days and nights before . It was envy , she thought . She did n't breathe out , and did n't breathe out . She kneeled at her door , one hand closed on the knob and the other holding her eavesdropper 's glass as she listened to the long silence in the room across the hall . Then one of the sweat-slicked , gargantuan lovers held by death at bay whispered words she could n't distinguish . Then one of them shifted great weight , the guest bed groaned , and Eleanor began to breathe . <p> Author Affiliation
