I WAS FIFTEEN , BUT I WAS N'T FOOLISH . I knew that everyone makes mistakes . I just meant to sidestep the worst mistakes , the ones I had witnessed among family and neighbors . I would not double-mortgage any bad Kansas property only to buy more . I would not become stupidly religious and expect God to step in where he had never been seen before . I would not marry heedlessly , as Mama and Pa had done . They would not be surprised to hear me say that ; everybody in Mercer County said the same . People were used to having a say in things . We did n't own much , but we had opinions . <p> Everybody knew I could n't cook , but at least I could sew . Of course , it would have been better the other way around . Luelle Morrisey had a face like a mud hen 's backside , but she could make a good meal at the end of winter when nothing was left in the root cellar but tired apples and onions gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at church socials her pies were bid up past three dollars . " A good cook is good value , " grinned Ordell Rightsbaugh , one of three ranchers courting her . By the time I was nine years old , I could sew a straight seam , and at fifteen I could make a hem stitch that no one could see , but nobody assigned value to what he could n't see . <p> Me , I did n't assign value to what I could see . hot and itchy after dropping onions in the crusty frying pan , I would stroll out to lean on the garden fence . There I 'd look at the dim horizon as if it might have changed in the last ten minutes . The long dirt , gray brown , folded into the flat sky , gray white . I gazed and gazed , trying to search out one thing worth looking at . Behind me , the onions burned . At supper Pa poked his fork at my stew , lumps of flour floating next to the shingles of black onion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring in as much as a mule , " he said . <p> " More than chickens , though , " I said . <p> " How many chickens ? " <p> " A dozen , easy . I am good value , " I said . <p> " For somebody who already ate , " he said . <p> Meals would have gone better if he 'd just let Mama or one of my sisters cook , but he had ideas about things , and he made Tuesdays my cooking days . He thought I 'd learn something I would need , but my fingers , reliably quick with a needle , could not tell the difference between bread that was cooked through and a loaf still marshy at the center . Even fruit seemed to go bad when I touched it , and when Pa was n't in the house , my sisters quietly pushed me out of the kitchen . They and the hands , the years we had hands , avoided dinner on Tuesdays . Me , I was skinny as a whip and could get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what Pa would admit , I had my value . I could weigh a spool of thread in my hand and tell if it was rotten at the center . I could stitch a buttonhole in brand-new denim , and I could mend a tear so that it blended right into the cloth around it , invisible even in church when the eye needed something to rest on . It was beautiful because no one could see it , a point I had sense enough to keep to myself . <p> There were other things to keep to myself : When Ernold Brown , who had already put two wives in the ground , twitched and snuffled his way up to Nussine Potter after church service , I saw that he was fixing to marry again . I hiked all the way to his place with a nosegay of coneflowers that he could bring Nussine . He gave me a nickel , the first coin I did n't have to drop in the collection plate , and I had sense enough not to tell Pa about it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could judge when he had drunk one glass of whiskey too many and was itching to hit something . My doughy sisters never learned to clear out of his way , but I could tell a beating was coming the same way that a person can smell rain . " That 's bad-looking leather , " he 'd say , looking at a patched harness . " Cheap . Everything about it looks cheap . " Then he 'd raise his head and say , " It 's not one thing worth a tinkers damn on this place . " Or in this county , or in this state . The fury would sweep over him like storm clouds . Folks knew him as a joke teller , but he was n't amiable , and his jokes could turn rough in a hurry . All I had to do was glance at him to see the caged anger , feel the urge to hit as if it were in my own hands . Sometimes it was , and I 'd go out and smack at a cottonwood until my palm stung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain jokes to her , said Pa and I were cut from the same pie . Like him , I was restless all the time , ants under my skin , and a day spent plowing would leave me fretful with wanting something I could n't put a name to . When I trudged out to the barn , my eyes cut over our paltry hundred sixty acres of wheat the same way his did . Everyone around us was buying up acreage before land prices went up again-soon ours would be the smallest farm in the county . Pa could have borrowed money to expand . The bank was loaning money to the Pecks , who had n't met a payment in five years . The manager would have loaned to us . But Pa looked out to the west toward what he did n't own , what nobody owned . He did n't want more of what he already had . <p> He was squinting at the fence line when I came up to him one afternoon . He had put his hat aside somewhere , and the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man was careless , shedding things wherever he went-shoes and papers and tobacco . Mama spent her life picking up his litter . Myself , I would have let it lie . <p> " Feller dies and goes to the seat of judgment , " he said , eyes trained on the blurred horizon . He did n't even look back to make sure it was me he was talking to . " Jesus says , ' You 've got yourself a bad record . You 've cheated , stolen , lied . You 're going to have to go to hell . ' <p> " Feller falls down at the feet of the Lord . He cries and begs for mercy . ' Its true that I did n't lead a good life , but I was n't all evil . I cared for my mama and gave to the poor . I gave money to your church . ' <p> " The Lord softens . ' All right , " he says . ' I 'll take mercy on you . You can start again , homesteading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up at the face of the Lord . ' Is that spot in hell still open ? ' " <p> " Dare you to tell it to the preacher , " I said . <p> " Not everybody wants to hear the truth , " he said . <p> " Preacher says only the Gospel is the truth . " <p> " This is a different gospel , " Pa said . " For those who have ears . " <p> " Dare you to tell it to the visiting preacher . He 's coming to dinner . Mama sent me out to fetch you . " <p> " You 're not cooking , are you ? " <p> " It 's Thursday , " I said . My sister Mac 's turn . <p> " Lucky for him . " <p> " Mama wants you to wear your Sunday shirt . " <p> " Bad as going to church , " he said . " If I have to wear my Sunday shirt in my own house , maybe I will tell him my joke . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had jokes of his own : the one about the lamb and the peacock , the one about the squirrel who went to Bible camp , the one about the three ministers who went to heaven . After a while , we stopped forcing ourselves to laugh since our laughter made no difference to Reverend Parley . While Mae 's good pot roast hardened in front of him , he planted an elbow on either side of the plate and said , " Man finds himself at the pearly gates . The Lord says , ' Son , it 's your day of reckoning . You lived a bad life . You smoked , you drank , you did n't do right in business . There 's only one place for you to go . ' " <p> " We know this one , " Pa said . <p> Reverend Parley did n't even pause . " The man says , ' Remember when I saved that widow ? Remember when I ran into the burning house and snatched up the baby ? Does n't that count for something ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those things count for something . You can go to Wichita . ' <p> " The man says , ' Remember that hundred dollars I stole ? ' " <p> Into the pause around the table , Pa said , " We tell it different . " <p> " I imagine so . Everybody loves this one in Texas . " <p> Mama got up a smile and shook her head . " You 're a regular theater . " <p> " Do you come from Texas ? " I asked . Girls in Mercer County did n't talk at the table , and Pa 's glance was sharp . <p> " I travel so much , I 'm not sure where I come from anymore . I know where I 'm going when the Lord tells me to hang up my spurs , though . " <p> " You 're not wearing spurs , " Pa said . <p> " Where , Reverend ? " said polite Mama . <p> " California . Heaven on earth . " <p> " I do n't imagine that 's part of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailing for a time , and I went to Los Angeles to recover my health . I do n't mind telling you , I 'd go back , even if it meant falling sick again . " <p> " What ailed you ? " Pa said . <p> " Tell us about California , " I said at the same time . I could see that my chatter was nettling Pa , but he would n't lay a hand on any of us before company , especially a minister . <p> Reverend Parley put on a sharp smile that did n't look right on a preacher . " If California is not the promised land , it 's the closest we 'll see in this life . To walk in an orange grove is to be in Eden . The air smells sweet and sharp at the same time , and the leaves shine , and the oranges all but push themselves into your hands . Have you ever eaten an orange ? " <p> Pa said , " We see a few luxuries . We 're not poor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the fruit is sweet and so quenching you imagine you 'll never be thirsty again . The flowers are tiny , but they put out a powerful scent . And then you get to the end of the grove , and the next thing you see is the ocean crashing onto sand . " <p> " Salty soil kills most plants , " Pa said . " Guess your orange trees are different . " <p> Reverend Parley made a brushing motion . " Maybe not exactly at the end of the grove . But close . " <p> " What does it look like ? " I said . <p> The reverend stopped talking , which amazed us all . He looked around the kitchen , eyes skidding over the freshly blacked cookstove and the magazine pictures Mama had put up on the walls to look at , as well as the hard dirt floor and pie safe with the weeping willow punched into the tin door . He picked up a white enamel pot lid with a blue rim and said , " Hold this close to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Closer , " so I moved the lid until its edge was practically in my eye . " What do you see ? " he said . <p> " The blue is wobbly , and then there 's white over it . That 's all . " <p> " That 's close , " he said , " except it 's beautiful . " <p> " I like the land , myself , " Mama said . " I like seeing where I stand . Would you care for some pie ? " <p> I kept staring at the lid . What I saw , the blur of blue into white , was n't beautiful , but I could imagine it turning beautiful . I probably looked like a pure fool , staring at a pot lid as if it were a magazine picture , but the minister had given me something that I did n't understand . There was nothing of Kansas in that blue line . <p> After Mac 's dried-apple pie , Reverend Parley put down his fork and announced , " Now that was cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said since giving the blessing . I put on a pleasant expression , planning to think about oceans while he talked to us about salvation . Pa looked sour . But Reverend Parley kept unsettling us ; he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a harmonica . The first song he played was " Amazing Grace , " which we none of us sang well , and after that he started on a tune I 'd never heard . Sweet and slow , it had a clean ache , and I studied the tablecloth so that no one would be able to see my wet eyes . Surprising all of us , Mama joined in , her low voice true . <p> Oh Shenandoah , <p> I long to hear you . <p> Look away <p> You rolling river . <p> She only sang when she felt moved ; sometimes years would pass . But when she opened her mouth , we all hushed . Suddenly the air was rich , and so it became poor when she stopped . <p> " That 's no church song , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It can be , " Reverend Parley said . <p> " How ? " Pa said . <p> " It 's about having to go away . It 's not what you want to do , but it 's what you have to do . " <p> I asked , " Why does somebody have to go away ? " <p> " Me , I heard a Call , " Reverend Parley said . <p> " What about somebody who 's not a reverend ? " <p> " Nell , " Mama said . <p> " What does a Call sound like ? " I said , heedless as a chick . It was n't Mama who would hurt me . She could barely lift her hand to beat biscuits . <p> Reverend Parley said , " Two Episcopalian ministers arrive at the same church , with the congregation there waiting . Its a big church , folks are well dressed , there are fine carriages outside . The first one says to the people in the church , ? heard a Call . I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a Call too , ' says the second preacher . <p> " ' What did yours say ? ' <p> " ' Lo , I will make you a leader of nations . What did yours say ? ' <p> " ' No one ever lost money on hog futures . ' <p> ' " Preach on ! ' cried the congregation . " <p> Pa snorted . Myself , I had never seen an Episcopalian . I said , " I do n't think anybody gets called to Kansas for money . Nobody 's got any . " <p> Reverend Parley said to Pa , " She 's the spit of you , is n't she ? " <p> " Her bad luck , " Pa said . <p> Reverend Parley stayed in town for a week , but we did n't go to hear him preach past the first day , when everyone went . I did n't want to see any more of the man . He had left me feeling rumpled , and even if I was n't fool enough to repeat the experiment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had given me of a view that was light and rested on a color I 'd never found in nature . <p> Pa could see my distraction . I was never able to hide anything from the man if he wanted to look , and ever since the dinner with Reverend Parley he kept me close to hand . The Tuesday after the reverend 's visit he took me out to the barn . Doing chores with him meant I did n't have to make dinner , but it also meant Pa had something he wanted to say , so it was hard to know whether I felt freed or trapped . " Did you call me out here because you 're wanting a piece of meat tonight that 's cooked all the way through ? " I said . <p> " You 're a stubborn thing . " He handed me the flat tin of barn salve that we used on all the cows ' cuts and wounds . The salve had been white once , but it had aged to a thick yellow and smelled like bad cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the tin , and this summer we 'd had to open it a lot . Both our cows were eaten up by biting flies , their rumps pink with weeping , crusted sores . The cows could hardly stand to be touched , even to be milked , and their lowing was full of long misery . They were normally sweet-tempered animals , but in a minute one of them would try to nip one of us while we kept dabbing on the sticky ointment . Pa said , " You could make things easy , but you wo n't do it . " <p> " What 's easy ? " The smell of the greasy salve stuck to me . The cow twitched her flat rump and huffed irritably . <p> " Girls half your age can manage to make a loaf of bread that does n't come up gummy in the middle . " <p> " It 's a knack . I have n't got it . " <p> " I think we all can see that much . " He reached across the cow 's back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl , what do you want ? " <p> If Pa had looked mean or angry I would have known what to say , but his face was closed . Mostly , I was aware of the rich , sweet smell of the cows , the tang of manure , and the sour medicine that was smeared halfway up to my elbows now . " I like to sew . " Puny words , embarrassing . <p> " I went to town last week . Jack Plat asked after you . His daddy 's spread is bigger than this one . " <p> Everybody 's spread was bigger than ours . Pa was fond of saying that buying more Kansas land was like buying extra acreage from Old Scratch . When he was sober he said it smiling . My hands shook a little when I said , " What did you tell him ? " <p> " I told him you were tolerable . " <p> " You do n't help a girl much , do you ? " <p> " I do n't see as that 's my job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilled between us . The Plats had a house with a window , and it occurred to me that it would be a fine thing to look outside of a house during the daylight . Pa said , " What should I have told him , Nell ? That you spent half an evening looking at a pot lid as if it could tell you something ? " <p> " No , do n't tell him that . " <p> " Jack 'll come to see you if I do n't stop him . " <p> " That 's what people do , I think . They go see each other . " <p> " I 'm only going to ask you this once . Is Jack what you want ? " <p> He let me take my time . Jack was a new thought . Shorter than me , with bandy legs , he had hair so curly that we used to baa at him in school . His mother was a tyrant , his father a quiet man who stayed out of his wife 's way . Even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the building from her , a skill we all admired . <p> Jack favored his mother , and I wondered whether that should worry me . His lamb-like curls were hers , and his strut , and his quick , cutting words when he was exercised . No one in Mercer County knew him to be a kind man . But he had once spent better than an hour flat on his belly under an outhouse , coaxing two kittens to come to him . He must have washed them because when he brought them home in a basket they were as fluffy as kittens on a greeting card , and he talked his mother into keeping them . I had n't seen any of this , but everybody knew the story . I would learn other stories , different ones , if I lived in the Plat place . <p> " He 's nice enough , " I said . <p> " No he is n't , but I wo n't stop you , " Pa said . " I just want you to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Once you decide , you 've decided . You ca n't come up for air later and say , ' Gaw , that was a mistake . ' So think . Is this what you want out of your future ? " <p> " Futures a hard thing to see . " I presumed that Pa was thinking about me squinting across the top of the pot lid . I could still see that wavery line , full of possibility . <p> " You better can . " <p> " Did you , when you courted Mama ? " <p> The rough bristles of the cow 's tail whipped me under the ear . " That 'll be a welt , " Pa said . " Be sure to tell folks it was Dixie did it , not me . " He spread more salve , working the yellow ointment down into the little craters that oozed with their own clear juice . " Your mother is a good woman . I could n't ask for a better one . She knows how to stretch a nickel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He was n't saying anything but the truth . Everybody knew that Mama was sweet by nature , just like they knew that Pa and I were the hankerers . <p> " She 's never raised her voice to me , even when she ought should have , " he said . " When I went to call on her , folks said she was sweet as a honeycake . " <p> I went back over a sore I 'd already dabbed . Pa was n't much on sweets , even Mae 's good pies . <p> " What I 'm about to say is not a complaint , you hear me ? I esteem your mother . I wo n't hold with anything else . " Now that Pa had stopped touching her backside , Dixie was placid , munching the oats he put out for her . " It is a fine thing to share your days with a person . That 's what a marriage is-sharing . You share a home and a place . You share children . But your mother and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields I see fences that need fixed , the place where the seed washed out . She does n't see those things . " <p> " I know that , " I said . <p> " I 'm trying to tell you something . What do you know about Jack ? " <p> Folks did n't call on him first when help was wanted , but they called on him eventually . He wrote an unexpectedly nice hand-better than mine . He was quick with sums , bad with geography , tolerable with scripture if no one got too picky . My whole knowledge of him was almost nothing , and that fact suddenly excited me . There was no telling what talents Jack might have , what thoughts I 'd never guessed at . At this moment he might be standing in his own barn , thinking of me , and the excitement of that thought made my voice tremble . " Same as you . Their place will support another mouth , and his mother 's a pistol . " <p> " Not much . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're still a youngster . Wait for a feller who you know you like . " <p> " I like Jack fine . " Pa waited for me to continue , but I had nothing to add about Jack . " If I do n't take him , I guess I 'll be waiting for Reverend Parley to come back and take me to California . I hear it 's heaven on earth . " <p> " I guess you wo n't either . Man who lives riding circuit is n't looking for a wife to support . He wo n't be going back to heaven on earth . And his jokes were no good . " <p> " Then I guess I 'd better let Jack Plat come to call . Since I 'm not interested in being a spinster lady . " As if it had been waiting for just this moment , my mind produced a list of Mercer County bachelors : Sam Wynn , whose last wife had died in childbirth at age sixteen and who held girls too tight at dances ; Carth Knoller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the funeral home ; the scattering of ranchers who came in for feed and looked over girls with the same eyes they used for livestock . In that company , Jack looked handsome . He looked charming and witty , words I had never had call to use before . Maybe people used words like that in California . IfI could n't go , I could use the words . I , who had hardly seen a body of water in my life , suddenly felt borne away . <p> Pa said , " There 's no call to rush . You 're still half a child . " <p> This was the first time he had indicated I was anything but all a child , and hearing him say so brought feeling up in me-something hard , screwed down tight . The cow ointment stung my eyes . I said , " I 'm not after staying on the smallest ranch in Kansas . I 'd like to see something fresh for a change . " <p> He put on a grin I 'd never seen before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tighten harder , like something pressed on until it gives out . He said , " Its not enough for you to see your old Pa ? " <p> " That 's the first thing I want to stop seeing , " I said , hating the words the second they flew from my mouth . They were not what I meant to say . There were no words for what I meant to say . <p> Pa 's face slammed shut . He pitched the open tin of cow ointment at me ; its top side stuck itself square against my nose and eyes , and for a panicky second all I could breathe was old , sticky fat and kerosene . <p> " - next week , " Pa was saying as I shook the tin off . " Tomorrow . I wo n't have your mother living with a child who does n't know respect . " <p> " Is there a rag ? " I said . The ointment was all over my face and spattered onto my neck and shoulders . I was struggling not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw a feed sack at me so hard the tie strings whipped my ear . " Mouth on you like an outhouse . No gratitude . " <p> I rubbed the burlap over my face , scraping clots of the ointment that we would need again soon back into the tin . " I 'm guessing Orris Plat does n't throw cow medicine at anybody . " <p> " I would n't bet against his wife 's throwing arm , though . Looks like you 'll be finding out . You can write a letter and tell us all . " <p> " Are you going to lock me out of the house tonight ? " <p> " I should . But you 'll have a home here as long as you want it . And you do n't want it . " <p> I stood wiping myself clean until Pa left the barn , the cow making contented grunts . There did n't seem anything wrong with Jack . I was fifteen years old . <p> Author Affiliation             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
