PROLOGUE Once upon a time there were four girls . Young women , you might even say . And though their lives traveled in different directions , they loved each other very much . Once upon a time before that , these same girls found a pair of pants , wise and magical , and named them the Traveling Pants . The Pants had the magic of teaching these girls how to be apart . They taught them how to be four people instead of one person . How to be together no matter where they were . How to love themselves as much as they loved each other . And on a practical level , the Pants had the magic of fitting all four of them , which is hard to believe but true , especially considering only one of them ( the blonde ) was built like a supermodel . Okay . Full disclosure . I am one of these girls . I wear these Pants . I have these friends . I know this magic . I am in fact the blonde , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it happens with most kinds of magic , these Pants did their job a little too well . And the girls , being extraordinary girls ( if you do n't mind my saying so ) , learned their lesson a little too well . And so when the girls ' lives changed that final summer , the Pants , being wise , had to change too . And that is how this tale of sisterhood began , but did not end . **53;425;TOOLONG was the same.It always was . And what a relief too , Lena found herself thinking . Good thing you could count on human vanity and the onward march of fitness crazes requiring mats and mirrors . Not much else was the same . Things were different , things were missing . Carmen , for instance , was missing . " I ca n't really see how we can do this without Carmen , " Tibby said . As was the custom , she 'd brought her video camera for posterity , but she had n't turned it on . Nobody was quite sure about when posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So maybe we should n't try , " Bee said . " Maybe we should wait until we can do it together . " Lena had brought the candles , but she had n't lit them . Tibby had brought the ceremonial bad eighties aerobics music , but she had n't put it on . Bee had gamely set out the bowls of Gummi Worms and Cheetos , but nobody was eating them . " When 's that going to be ? " Tibby asked . " Seriously , I think we 've been trying to get together since last September and I do n't think it has happened once . " " What about Thanksgiving ? " Lena asked . " Remember I had to go to Cincinnati for Great-grandma Felicia 's hundredth birthday ? " Tibby said . " Oh , yeah . And she had a stroke , " Bee said . " That was after the party . " " And Carmen went to Florida over Christmas , " Lena said . " And you two were in New York over New Year 's . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Carmen will be back by then , wo n't she ? " " Yeah , but my classes start on June twentieth . " Lena clasped her hands around her knees , her large feet bare on the sticky pine floor . " I ca n't miss the first day of the pose or I 'll end up stuck in a corner or staring at the model 's kneecap for a month . " " Okay , so July fourth , " Tibby said reasonably . " Nobody has school or anything that Friday . We could meet back here for a long weekend ? " Bee untied her shoe . " I fly to Istanbul on June twenty-fourth . " " That soon ? Can you go later ? " Tibby asked . Bridget 's face dimmed with regret . " The program put us all on this charter flight . Otherwise it 's an extra thousand bucks and you have to find your own way to the site . " " How could Carmen miss this ? " Tibby asked . Lena knew what she meant . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual , but especially not Carmen , to whom it had mattered so much . Bee looked around . " Miss what , though ? " she asked , not so much challenging as conciliating . " This is n't really the launch , right ? " She gestured to the Pants , folded obediently in the middle of their triangle . " I mean , not officially . We 've been wearing them all school year . It 's not like the other summers , when this was the huge kickoff and everything . " Lena was n't sure whether she felt comforted or antagonized by this statement . " Maybe that 's true , " Tibby said . " Maybe we do n't need a launch this summer . " " We should at least figure out the rotation tonight , " Lena said . " Carmen will just have to live with it . " " Why do n't we keep up the same rotation we 've had going till now ? " Bridget suggested , straightening her legs in front of her . " No reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit the skin around her thumbnail and considered the practical truth of this . Summer used to be different . It was the time they left home , split up , lived separate lives for ten long weeks , and counted on the Pants to hold them together until they were reunited . Now summer was more of the same . Being apart was n't the exception , Lena recognized , it was the rule . When will we all be home again ? That was what she wanted to know . But when she thought about it logically , she knew : It was n't just the answer that had changed , it was the question . What was home anymore ? What counted as the status quo ? Home was a time and it had passed . Nobody was eating the Gummi Worms . Lena felt like she should eat one or cry . " So we 'll just keep up the rotation , " she echoed wanly . " I think I get them next . " " I have it written down , " Tibby said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her watch . " Should we just go ? " " I guess , " Tibby said . " Do you want to stop at Tastee Diner on the way home ? " Bridget asked . " Yeah , " Tibby said , gathering the effects of a ritual that had n't quite happened . " Maybe we can see a late movie after . I ca n't handle my parents tonight . " " What time are you guys taking off tomorrow ? " Bee asked . " I think our train 's at ten , " Tibby said . Lena and Tibby were taking the train together : Tibby was getting off in New York to start film classes and her Movieworld job , and Lena was heading up to Providence to change dorm rooms for the summer . Bee was spending a few days at home before she left for Turkey . Lena realized she did n't want to go home just yet either . She picked up the Pants and cradled them briefly . She had a feeling she could not name exactly , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pants before . She had felt gratitude , admiration , trust . What she felt now still contained allthat , but tonight it was mixed in with a faint taste of desperation . If we did n't have them , I do n't know what we would do , she found herself thinking as Bee pulled the door of Gilda 's shut behind them and they walked slowly down the dark stairs .  - -   - -   - -   - -   " Carmen , it is beautiful . I ca n't wait for you to see it . " Carmen nodded into the receiver . Her mother sounded so happy that Carmen had to be happy . How could she not be happy ? " When do you think you 'll move in ? " she asked , trying to keep her voice light . " Well , we will need to do some work . Some plastering , painting , refinishing the floors . There 's some plumbing and electrical to do . Hopefully we can get most of it out of the way before we move in . I hope it will be by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nena , it has five bedrooms . Is that unbelievable ? It has a beautiful backyard for Ryan to run around in . " Carmen thought of her tiny brother . He could barely walk yet , let alone run . He was going to grow up with such a different life than the one Carmen had . " So no more apartment , huh ? " " No . It was a good place for the two of us , but did n't we always want a house ? Is n't that what you always said you wanted ? " She 'd also wanted a sibling and for her mother not to be alone . It was n't always easy getting what you wanted . " I 'll have to pack up my room , " Carmen said . " You 'll have a bigger room in the new house , " her mother rushed to say . Yes , she would . But was n't it a bit late for that ? For having a house with a yard and a bigger room ? It was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had , and it had taken place in her small room in their apartment . It was sad and strange to lose it and too late to replace it . Where did that leave her ? Without her old life and not quite coming up with a new one . In between , floating , nowhere . That seemed all too fitting , in a way . " Lena dropped by yesterday to say hi and see Ryan . She brought him a Frisbee , " her mother mentioned a little wistfully . " I wish you were home . " " Yeah . But I 've got all this stuff going on here . " " I know , nena . " After she hung up with her mother , the phone rang again . " Carmen , where are you ? " Julia Wyman sounded annoyed . Carmen glanced behind her at her clock . " We 're supposed to be doing a run-through on set in . . . now ! " " I 'm coming , " Carmen said , pulling on her socks as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right there . " She hustled out of her dorm and to the theater . She remembered along the way that her hair was dirty and she 'd meant to change her pants , because the ones she was wearing made her feel particularly fat . But did it matter ? Nobody was looking at her . Julia was waiting for her backstage . " Can you help me with this ? " For her role in the production , Julia wore a long tweed skirt , and the waist was too big for her . Carmen bent down to work on the safety pin . " How 's that ? " she asked , pinning the waistband in the back . " Better . Thanks . How does it look ? " Julia looked good in it . Julia looked good in most things , and she did n't need Carmen to tell her so . But Carmen did anyway . In a strange way , it was Julia 's job to look good for both of them . It was Carmen 's job to appreciate her for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Carmen stepped onto the stage , but Roland did n't appear to be waiting for her . He did n't react in any way when he saw her . These days she felt her presence had the same effect as a ghost -- nobody noticed her , but the air suddenly got cold . Carmen squinted and tried to make herself small . She did not like being onstage when the lights were on . " Did you need something ? " she asked Roland . " Oh , yeah . " He was trying to remember . " Can you fix the curtain in the parlor ? It 's falling off . " " Sure , " she said quickly , wondering if she should feel guilty . Was she the one who put it up last ? She positioned the ladder , climbed up three rungs , and aimed a staple gun at the plywood wall . Set building was strange in that it was always about the impression , made to be seen from particular angles and not made to last . It existed in space and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She liked the chunk sound of the staple clawing into the wall . It was one of the things she 'd learned at college : how to operate a staple gun . Her dad was paying a lot of money for that . She 'd learned other stuff too . How to gain seventeen pounds eating cafeteria food and chocolate at night when you felt lonely . How to be invisible to guys . How not to wake up for your nine o'clock psychology class . How to wear sweatshirts almost every day because you felt self-conscious about your body . How to elude the people you loved most in the world . How to be invisible to pretty much everyone , including yourself . It was lucky she 'd gotten to know Julia . Carmen was very fortunate , she knew . Because Julia was one of the most visible people on campus . They balanced each other out . Without Julia on the campus of Williams College , Carmen privately suspected she might disappear altogether . For more of this excerpt go to SisterhoodCentral.com !
