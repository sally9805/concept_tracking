The harsh buzz of the doorbell shocked the knife out of Annabelle Fiore 's hand . <br> She jumped back to avoid being nicked by the blade as it clattered to the floor . Just what I need right now . . . chop off my own toe . <br> As Annabelle put the knife safely on the counter , the microwave clock rolled to 7:00 . The Linggs were unfashionably punctual . She had been counting on their tardiness to give her time to finish making the salad . <br> But Rosemarie and David were n't expecting to be entertained . Her friends were here to distract her from pre- opening-night jitters , relax her  --  they 'd be happy to sit in the kitchen while she cooked . Annabelle crossed the foyer and opened the door of her Greenwich Village brownstone . The final aria from Tosca , piped through her high- end sound system , tumbled into the raindarkened street . <br> " Welco  --  " <br> A person dressed in black  --  not Rosemarie , not David  --  pushed Annabelle backward . A hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A steel- toed boot kicked the door closed . <br> Annabelle opened her mouth . The quick intake of breath needed to scream accelerated her downfall . A cloying , harsh scent burned her nose and mouth as a thick square of damp cloth pressed into her face . The bold tones of the Roger Selden abstract paintings on the foyer wall faded into the distance . Annabelle 's knees buckled , and the gloved hand released its grip . <br> Falling , she glimpsed a flash of metal . <br> Her attacker 's fist opened , revealing a small glass vial . Annabelle 's last coherent thought formed . Why me , dear God , why me ? skeleton justice <br> Chapter Two <br> Get back where you belong . <br> Dr. Jake Rosen could hear his boss saying it as he looked down at Annabelle Fiore . The opera singer 's olive skin had blanched to white ; her arms lay stiffly at her sides . Jake reached out to touch her wrist . Her eyelids fluttered . <br> The living are not your concern . <br> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forensic pathologist was at St. Vincent 's Hospital conducting a physical exam of a living victim . As deputy chief medical examiner of the City of New York , Jake spent most of his working hours at crime scenes or in the autopsy suite of the morgue . The chief ME , Charles Pederson , frowned on unauthorized field trips . <br> Gently , Jake turned Fiore 's right arm to examine the inner side . There , in the crook of her elbow , was a tiny puncture where a needle had been inserted to draw blood . He studied it closely . No multiple attempts , not even much bruising around the site . <br> The emergency room physicians and residents who had treated Fiore the night before would n't have noticed this . They had saved Fiore the night before would n't have noticed this . They had saved the opera singer 's lofe by evaluating her injuries from a medical standpoint . To them , the lack of trauma at the blood-extraction site was good news : no treatment required , so they could focus all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that tiny , perfect puncture was significant . <br> Whoever had attacked Fiore knew how to extract blood from a vein . This was not the work of an amateur . Not a random act of violence . <br> His gaze traveled down the length of her arm . There , near the wrist , were three distinct bruises . Her assailant had gripped her arm tightly and held her until she stopped struggling . Just as with the first four victims . <br> Jake had n't examined them , but he 'd been briefed by Vito Pasquarelli , lead detective on the case . The first attack had occurred over a month ago . A young mother on the Upper West <br> Side had responded to a knock on her door in the middle of the day . The next thing she remembered was waking up groggy from ether-induced unconsciousness . She , and the police , had assumed the attacker had come to rob her . Except nothing was missing from her home . <br> It was n't until hours later that she noticed the tiny needle mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off . She had n't been harmed . It was weird , but weird was status quo in New York . File a report and move on . <br> Then it happened again . A teacher in the Bronx , an investment banker in Battery Park City , a foreign tourist attending a pharmaceutical conference in midtown . None of them seriously hurt , all of them thoroughly freaked-out . It did n't help that somewhere along the line the tabloids started calling the stalker " the Vampire . " <br> Although Jake did n't subscribe to the media melodrama , skeleton justice he did understand the public 's fear . New Yorkers , blasT about <br> drive-by shootings and shoves onto subway tracks , were terrified by a guy with a needle . He 'd seen it often enough in his medical training  --  hulking football players who stoically endured compound fractures , then passed out when the nurse arrived to give them a tetanus shot ; gang members who survived knife fights , only to whimper when it was time to be sewn up . Needles were scary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a famous someone , not with his needle , but with an overdose of ether . Jake pulled a stethoscope from his pocket . He 'd had to search to find one ; it was n't an instrument he had much use for in the normal course of his day . Fiore stirred slightly as he listened to her heart . The beat was steady , but the rate was slow , consistent with having been drugged into unconsciousness . This is where the Vampire analogy fell apart . Vampires , the kind who lived in Transylvania and flapped around in black capes , did n't anesthetize their victims . And apparently , New York 's vampire was n't too adept at it . <br> Of course , even a trained anesthesiologist could easily make a mistake with ether . That 's why it was n't used much anymore . And if you were administering the drug via a soaked rag , getting the dosage right became even more problematic . Perhaps the biggest surprise was that an overdose had n't happened until Fiore , the fifth victim . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would have died had her friends not arrived shortly after the attack . The effects still had n't worn off . Jake would have liked to ask her some questions , but although she stirred slightly as he examined her , she was only semi-conscious . An interview would have to wait . <br> Jake turned away from the hospital bed just as a short , rumpled man entered the room . <br> " Hey , you made it ! " Detective Vito Pasquarelli shook Jake 's hand enthusiastically . " Thanks for coming . Have you looked at her ? " <br> " Yes . It 's hard to draw much of a conclusion , given that I did n't get to examine the others . But if their blood- draw sites were as perfect as Ms. Fiore 's , I 'd say you 're dealing with someone with some medical training . " <br> Pasquarelli nodded . " What about the ether ? " <br> " Hard to know if the overdose was accidental or intentional . <br> He seems to have given her quite a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his hair , moving his style further along the scale from casually wild to unkempt . " But here 's a thought that occurred to me . I know you said none of the victims is acquainted with any of the others . But you might want to ask them if they have any ties to a person who works around laboratory animals . " <br> " You mean like rats and mice ? Why ? " <br> " When researchers conduct experiments on animals and then have to autopsy them , they often kill them with an overdose of ether . That 's the most common use for the drug these days . " Vito perked up as they walked toward the elevator . " And a medical researcher would know how to draw blood , right ? " <br> Jake nodded . " And how to test it . Which is what I 'd like to do . " <br> " Our CSI guys already did that . No trace of drugs in any of them . Nothing hinky . " <br> Jake grinned . " Funkiness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to me . I 'd like to run my own tests . " <br> " You got it . " The packed elevator arrived and the men descended in silence . <br> " What do you think he does with it ? " Vito asked as the impatient crowd pushed past them into the lobby . <br> " I think he tests it , just like I 'm going to do with it , " Jake said . <br> The detective looked relieved . <br> Jake raised his hand in a mock toast . " Unless he drinks it . " <br> Continues ...
