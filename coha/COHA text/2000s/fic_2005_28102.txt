Chapter One Your Daily Post , September 15 BLOODY NIGHTS OF DEATH ! ! ! This once-sleepy city is under siege . In the space of six short months eleven people have been brutally murdered , their bodies drained of blood and dumped in various public places . Many more have vanished into the shadows of the night and might be Iying beneath the streets , their lifeless bodies decomposing in the lonely dark . Officials can not account for the gruesome killing spree . They do not believe the murders to be the work of one man , but nor have they been able to link the crimes to any known criminals . In the largest single police operation in the city 's history , most local gangs have been broken up , religious cult leaders arrested , and the doors of secret orders and brotherhoods smashed down ... to no effect at all ! CUST0MARY BLUNTNESS Chief Inspector of Police Alice Burgess , when queried about the lack of results , responded with her own brand of customary bluntness . " We 've been working like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpaid overtime . Nobody 's avoiding responsibility . We 're patrolling the streets in force , arresting anyone who even looks suspicious . We 've initiated a 7 p.m. curfew for children , and have advisedadults to remain indoors too . If you find someone who can do a better job , give me a call and I 'll gladly step aside . " Comforting words-but nobody here is taking comfort from them . The people of this city are tired of promises and pledges . Nobody doubts the honest , hardworking efforts of the local police-or the army who have been called in to assist in the operation-but faith in their ability to bring an end to the crisis has hit an all-time low . Many are moving out of the city , staying with relatives or in hotels , until the killings cease . " I have kids , " Michael Corbett , the forty-six-year-old owner of a secondhand bookshop told us . " Running away does n't make me feel proud , and it 'll ruin my business , but the lives of my wife and children come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did thirteen years ago . We just have to wait for this to blow over , like it did before . When it does , I 'll return . In the meantime , I think anyone who stays is crazy . " HISTORY OF DEATH When Mr. Corbett spoke of the past , he was referring to a time , nearly thirteen years ago , when horror similarly visited this city . On that occasion , nine bodies were discovered by a pair of teenagers , butchered and drained as the recent eleven victims have been . But those bodies were carefully hidden , and only unearthed long after death had occurred . Today 's murderers-rather , tonight 's , since each victim has been taken after sunset-are not bothering to hide the evidence of their foul deeds . It 's as though they are proud of their cruelty , leaving the bodies where they know they will be found . Many locals believe the city is cursed and has a history of death . " I 've been expecting these killings for fifty years , " said Dr. Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Vampires visited here more than one hundred and fifty years ago , and the thing about vampires is , once they find a place they like- they always come back ! " DEMONS OF THE NIGHT Vampires . If Dr. Beisty 's was the only voice crying out against demons of the night , he could be dismissed as a crank . But many other people believe that we are suffering at the hands of vampires . They point to the fact that the attacks always occur at night , that the bodies have been drained of blood-seemingly without the aid of medical equipment-and , most tellingly , that although three of the victims were photographed by hidden security cameras when they were abducted , their attackers ? faces did not show up on film ! Chief Inspector Alice Burgess is dismissive of the vampire theory . " You think Count Dracula 's on the rampage ? " she laughed contemptuously . " Do n't be ridiculous ! This is the twenty-first century . Warped , sick humans are behind all this . Do n't waste my time blaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to add : " I do n't believe in vampires , and I do n't want idiots like you filling people 's heads with such nonsense . But I 'll tell you this : I 'll do whatever it takes to stop these savages . If that means driving a stake through some madman 's chest because he believes he 's a vampire , I 'll do it , even if it costs me my job and freedom . Nobody 's walking away from this on an insanity plea . There 's only one way to pay back the deaths of eleven good men and women-extermination ! " And I 'll do it , " Chief Inspector Burgess vowed , a fiery gleam in her pale eyes which would have done Professor Van Helsing proud . " Even if I have to track them to Transylvania and back . There 'll be no escaping the sword of justice , be they humans or vampires . " Tell your readers that I 'll get their tormentors . They can bet on that . They can bet their lives .... " MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , while Harkat and me waited in the darkness below . After checking the street for signs of life , he whispered , " All clear , " and we followed him up the ladder and out into fresh air . " I hate those bloody tunnels , " I groaned , slipping off my shoes , which were soaked through with water , mud , and other things I did n't want to think about . I 'd have to wash them out in the sink when we got back to the hotel and leave them on top of a radiator to dry , as I 'd been doing at the end of every night for the past three months . " I despise them too , " Mr. Crepsley agreed , gently prying the remains of a dead rat from the folds of his long red cloak . " They 're not so bad , " Harkat chuckled . It was OK for him-he had no nose or sense of smell ! " At least the rain has held off , " Mr. Crepsley said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll be wading up to our hips down there by mid-October . " " We will have located and dealt with the vampaneze by then , " Mr. Crepsley said , without conviction . " That 's what you said two months ago , " I reminded him . " And last month , " Harkat added . " You wish to call off the search and leave these people to the vampaneze ? " Mr. Crepsley asked quietly . Harkat and me looked at each other then shook our heads . " Of course not , " I sighed . " We 're just tired and cranky . Let 's go back to the hotel , dry ourselves off , and get something warm to eat . We 'll be fine after a good day 's sleep . " Finding a nearby fire escape , we climbed to the roof of the building and set off across the skylight of the city , where there were no police or soldiers . Six months had passed since the Lord of the Vampaneze escaped . Vancha had gone to Vampire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had not yet returned . For the first three months Mr. Crepsley , Harkat , and me had roamed without purpose , letting our feet take us where they wished . Then word reached us of the terror in Mr. Crepsley 's home city-people were being killed , their bodies drained of blood . Reports claimed vampires were to blame , but we already knew better . Rumors had already reached us of vampaneze in the city , and this was all the confirmation we needed . Mr. Crepsley cared for these people . Those he 'd known when he lived here as a human were long since dead and buried , but he looked upon their grandchildren and great-grandchildren as his spiritual family . Thirteen years earlier , when a mad vampaneze by the name of Murlough was savaging the city , Mr. Crepsley returned-with me and Evra Von , a snake-boy from the Cirque Du Freak-to stop him . Now that history was repeating itself , he felt compelled to intervene again . " But maybe I should ignore my feelings , " he 'd mused three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must focus on the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord . It would be wrong of me to drag us away from our quest . " " Not so , " I 'd disagreed . " Mr. Tiny told us we 'd have to follow our hearts if we were to find the Vampaneze Lord . Your heart 's drawing you home , and my heart says I should stick by you . I think we should go . " Harkat Mulds , a grey-skinned Little Person who 'd learned to talk , agreed , so we set off for the city where Mr. Crepsley had been born , to check out the situation and help if we could . When we arrived , we soon found ourselves in the middle of a mystery . Vampaneze were definitely living here-at least three or four , if our estimate was correct-but were they part of the war force or lone madmen ? If they were warriors , they should be more careful about how they killed-sane vampaneze do n't leave the bodies of their victims where humans can find them . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding so skillfully-after three months of searching , we had n't found a trace of a single vampaneze in the tunnels beneath the city . Back at the hotel , we entered through the window . We 'd rented two rooms on the upper floor , and used the windows to get in and out at night , since we were too dirty and damp to use the lobby . Besides , the less we moved around on the ground , the better-the city was in an uproar , with police and soldiers patrolling the streets , arresting anyone who looked out of place . While Mr. Crepsley and Harkat used the bathrooms , I undressed and waited for a free bath . We could have rented three rooms , so we 'd each have a bath , but it was safer for Harkat not to show himself-Mr . Crepsley and me could pass for human , but the monstrous-looking , stitched-together Harkat could n't . I nearly fell asleep sitting on the end of the bed . The last three months had been long and difficult . Every night we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vampaneze , avoiding the police , soldiers , and frightened humans , many of whom had taken to carrying guns and other weapons . It was taking its toll on all of us , but eleven people had died-that we knew of-and more would follow if we did n't stick to our task . Standing , I walked around the room , trying to stay awake long enough to get into the bath . Sometimes I did n't , and would awaken the following night stinking , sweaty , and filthy , feeling like something a cat had coughed up . I thought about my previous visit to this city . I 'd been much younger , still learning what it meant to be a half-vampire . I 'd met my first and only girlfriend here- Debbie Hemlock . She 'd been dark-skinned , full-lipped , and bright-eyed . I would have loved to get to know her better . But duty called , the mad vampaneze was killed , and the currents of life swept us apart . Several times since returning , I 'd walked by the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lived there . But new tenants had moved in , and there was no sign of the Hemlocks . Just as well , really-as a half-vampire I aged at a fifth the human rate , so although nearly thirteen years had passed since I last kissed Debbie , I only looked a few years older . Debbie would be a grown woman now . It would have been confusing if we 'd run into one another . The door connecting the bedrooms opened and Harkat entered , drying himself with a huge hotel towel . " The bath 's free , " he said , wiping around the top of his bald , grey , scarred head with the towel , careful not to irritate his round green eyes , which had no eyelids to protect them . " Cheers , ears , " I grinned , slipping by him . That was an in-joke-Harkat , like all the Little People , had ears , but they were stitched under the skin at the sides of his head , so it looked as if he did n't have any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and turned on the hot water faucet , so it was almost full with fresh water when I arrived . I tested the temperature , added a dash of cold , turned off the faucets , and slid in-heavenly ! I raised a hand to brush a lock of hair out of my eyes , but my arm would n't lift all the way-I was too tired . Relaxing , I decided to just lie there a few minutes . I could wash my hair later . To simply lie in the bath and relax ... for a few minutes .. would be ... Without finishing the thought , I fell soundly asleep , and when I awoke it was night again , and I was blue all over from having spent the day in a bath of cold , grimy water . ( Continues ... )
