CULTURE WATCH <P> More than 40 years after June Cleaver , TV has again discovered the American housewife . She may wish it had n't . In ABC 's Desperate Housewives ( Sundays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) , a suburban mom ( Brenda Strong ) wakes up one morning , does her chores , then shoots herself in the head . Her suicide leads her friends to question their own unhappy lives , from the career woman mired at home with her unruly kids ( Felicity Huffman ) to the maniacally perfect Martha Stewart wannabe ( Marcia Cross ) . <P> Housewives is already a critics ' darling for its mordant humor and terrific cast . But it trades on a dated image of ticky-tacky suburbia that Hollywood has been spoofing for decades . ( One character makes a batch of ambrosia , the marshmallow-studded salad that is as au courant in today 's upscale ' burbs as a beehive hairdo . ) And there 's something smug and icky about a bunch of TV professionals essentially implying that if their female suburban viewers only realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow their brains out . <P> At least give Housewives credit for looking at what our unrealistic ideals of domesticity do to women . Those ideals still rule on two new reality shows , Trading Spouses on Fox and Wife Swap on ABC , which give two moms a chance to run each other 's homes . Both shows are a hoot , but they also judge women entirely in terms of their housekeeping skills . On Swap , a millionaire with four nannies tearfully realizes she needs to spend less time at the spa and more with the kids : " I 've been to paradise , but I 've never been to me ! " Even Lifetime ( " Television for Women " ) now airs a series called How Clean Is Your House ? Meet theTV women of fall 2004 : damned if they dust , damned if they don't.  --  By James Poniewozik
