" I 'm in love , " I swore . <p> " You 're in heat , " Marcie replied . <p> My best friend , Marcie Hanover , and I were at the South Coast Plaza , one of L.A. 's trendiest shopping centers , and I was within seconds of performing a carnal act on a display case . <p> " Forget it , Haley , " Marcie told me . <p> " But it 's a Judith Leiber , " I said , caressing the glass case with my palms . Inside was the most gorgeous evening bag I 'd ever laid eyes on-and I 've seen a lot of bags . Marcie has , too . We readily admit to our handbag addiction . <p> In fact , over the last couple of months the two of us had moved beyond being compulsive , crazed , white twenty-somethings obsessed with designer purses . We were no longer simply handbag whores . Now we were handbag whore businesswomen . <p> Or trying to be . <p> " You ca n't get that bag , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Austrian crystals , " I said-actually , I think I moaned- " elegantly handcrafted . " <p> " No . " <p> " It 's got a satin lining . " <p> " Walk away from the case , Haley . " <p> " And comes in a gorgeous box . " <p> " Step back . Now . " <p> " With a keepsake bag ! " <p> " It 's two thousand dollars ! " <p> Best friends can really spoil a mood sometimes . <p> Marcie was right , though . Marcie is almost always right . I could n't get the bag-right now , anyway-thanks to the new direction my life had taken . <p> Only a couple of months ago I , Haley Randolph , with my dark hair worthy of a salon-shampoo print-ad in Vogue , my long pageant legs , and my beauty-queen genes-even though they 're mostly recessive-had figured everything out . And not only did I know what I wanted , but I also knew how to get it . Yeah , yeah , I knew I was twenty-four now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was n't the point . The point was that I was going for it . <p> Marcie and I left the store and moved through the mall with the rest of the late morning crowd . That gorgeous evening bag had taken possession of my brain ; I 'd probably lie awake all night figuring a way to get it . <p> " Are we still going to that new club tomorrow night ? " Marcie asked . <p> Hearing about an opportunity to party snapped me out of my Judith Leiber stupor . <p> " Yeah , sure , " I said . <p> " No homework this weekend ? " Marcie asked . <p> Damn . Homework . I 'd forgotten about it . Again . <p> In a startling moment of clarity worthy of a Lifetime Channel movie , I 'd made the decision to forgo my career , such as it was , in accounting , and blow off a move to San Francisco to pursue a higher education . I 'd wanted a real career , a profession . Something of substance , importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of others-plus , make a lot of money and buy great handbags , of course . <p> I still did n't know exactly what sort of position that would be , and did n't really care , as long as I could be the person in charge and everybody else had to do what I said . <p> Businesses would n't let you make the big decisions , take over , and run things unless you had credentials-go figure-so I was now pursuing my bachelor 's degree . The college counselor , who was obviously overdue for a stint in rehab , thought that because I had every weekday free , I should take a full load . That 's six classes , or something . <p> But I did n't want to overwhelm myself by taking on too much , so I cut my schedule down a little . The classes I picked were tough , though . Both of them . <p> So far , college seemed a lot like high school , so I did n't understand what the fuss was all about . Plus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to complete every single assignment and actually pay attention in class . I was just there to complete the course ; they seemed to think I wanted to learn something . <p> I was n't worried about my grades . English was easy-all I 'd done so far was copy stuff off the Internet-and I 'd be able to keep up the good grades in Health , as long as that girl who sat in front of me did n't start covering her paper . <p> Marcie and I left the mall and said good-bye in the parking lot , and I took the freeway to Santa Clarita , a really great upscale area about thirty minutes north of Los Angeles . I had an apartment there , which was terrific , and a job there that was n't . But that 's okay , because I was on my path toward a highly successful future ... somewhere , doing something . <p> Holt 's Department Store was seven minutes from my place-six , if I ran the light at the corner . It was a midrange store that sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessories , and housewares , mostly . <p> The corporate buyer in charge of the clothing ought to be taken out behind one of the stores and beaten-or worse , be forced to wear Holt 's clothing . Believe me , no one lies awake at night plotting a way to purchase anything on our racks . <p> I had started working there last fall just before Thanksgiving as a salesclerk . It was supposed to be through the holidays , but then all sorts of crap happened . I ended up with a hundred thousand dollars in the bank and a gorgeous boyfriend . <p> Somehow , things had n't turned out exactly as I 'd imagined . Having a hundred grand was n't as much fun as I thought it would be , and Ty Cameron , the man I thought I 'd fallen in love with , well , I was n't sure where things stood with him . <p> Which was totally his fault , of course . <p> That 's why I desperately needed that Judith Leiber evening bag . If a beautifully boxed clutch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag could n't cheer you up , was there any hope for mankind ? <p> I pulled into the parking lot in front of the Holt 's store . It was almost empty . The store was closed until 6:00 p.m. today to get ready for " our biggest sale of the season . " That 's what the sign in the front window said . But , really , the inventory team was working inside and did n't want to be bothered with customers . <p> I know exactly how they feel . <p> I swung around back and parked . The area outside the loading dock had been completely transformed . A big white tent-top had been erected . Latticework screens circled the tent and blocked out the view of the Dumpsters . Tables were decorated with pastels , and a runway led from a curtained platform . Another table held a couple dozen wrapped gifts . Potted green plants and blooming flowers were everywhere . One of the loading dock doors was open and I saw the caterer 's staff working inside the stockroom . <p> Holt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fashion show of the new line of spring clothing we were going to carry . They were also raffling off prizes . <p> I had to admit , the place looked great and the idea was a good one . I did n't really want to admit it , though , since the whole concept was Sarah Covington 's , Holt 's vice president of marketing . <p> I hate Sarah Covington . <p> Which is all her fault , of course . <p> An RV was parked near the stage , and I could hear teenage girls inside , giggling and chattering . I guessed they were the models , excited about strutting the spring fashions on the makeshift catwalk . <p> Two of my friends were already seated at a table . Bella was tall , black , and working at Holt 's to save for beauty school . Girlfriend knew hair . I was thinking she was into an international landmark phase . Today , her hair looked like the Eiffel Tower . Next to her was Sandy . White , young , pretty , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doormat tattooed across her back . <p> They 'd saved me a seat , which was way cool , so I gave them a wave as I headed for the steps leading up to the loading dock . Then Rita planted herself in front of me and folded her arms . <p> " The store is off-limits , " she said . " You ca n't go in there . " <p> Rita was the cashiers ' supervisor , though from the way she dressed-stretch pants and tops with farm animals on the front-you 'd think she was the corporate clothing buyer . <p> Rita hated me . I hated her first . Then she took it to the next level when she jacked the purse party business idea Marcie and I came up with and stole all our customers . Now I double-hated her . <p> " The inventory team is working in the store , " Rita said . " Absolutely nobody is allowed inside . " <p> " If I throw a stick , will you leave ? " I said to her . <p> " Nobody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes you , princess , no matter who you 're sleeping with . " <p> Rita gave me one last nasty look and stomped away . <p> I was pretty sure she was referring to my sort-of boyfriend , Ty Cameron . He was the fifth generation of his family to own and run the Holt 's stores . <p> You 'd think that would entitle me to a few perks around here-I do n't think there 's anything wrong with preferential treatment as long as it benefits me - but no . I was still pulling down seven bucks an hour ; plus , I had to actually wait on customers . <p> Contrary to what Rita and most everyone else thought , Ty and I were n't having sex . Yet . Which was totally his fault . Okay , well , maybe some of my fault , too . <p> I bounded up the steps to the loading dock . The servers were bustling around getting ready to take out the first course . I recognized the caterer , Marilyn something-or-other . Everything looked and smelled great . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut into the shapes of flowers , and arranged in little terra-cotta pots . They were from Edible Elegance , my mom 's latest experiment with living in the real world . <p> My mom was a former beauty queen . Really . Before she married my dad and had my brother , sister , and me , Mom was prancing the runways , performing-I 'm not sure what Mom 's " talent " was ; she told me , but I was n't paying attention-and wishing for world peace . <p> Mom never really hung up her crown . Once a beauty queen , always a beauty queen , apparently-sort of like the marines , except the marines are n't quite as ruthless . She was still involved with the pageant world and a coven , as I liked to think of them , of other ex-queens , though I was n't sure how , exactly ; I was n't paying attention to that either . <p> Just where Mom got the idea of the Edible Elegance fruit bouquets I do n't know-I doubt Mom knew , either-but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months now . I helped out with the business , sometimes . <p> So you 'd think that my mom was a hardworking , inventive , highly motivated businesswoman . Right ? <p> No . My mom 's idea of running a business was to hire a manager , turn the whole thing over to her , and see what happened . This , of course , drove the old geezer who oversaw the trust fund Mom 's grandmother left her-along with a fabulous house in LaCanada Flintridge-absolutely crazy . <p> That 's my mom . <p> I checked out the fruit bouquets . Everything looked great . The crew Mom 's manager hired had done a terrific job . They 'd added a chocolate name tag to some of the bouquets , which I had n't seen before , and I thought the personalization was a nice touch . I guess Mom was still coming up with some ideas after all . <p> Outside I heard Jeanette Avery , the store manager , on the mic welcoming everyone to the luncheon . Jeanette was in her fifties , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Holt 's . This inexplicably manifested itself in her attire . She always dressed in Holt 's clothing . Today , she had on a **25;99;TOOLONG dress . The remaining nine dresses that had been shipped to the store were on the clearance rack . <p> I was about to head outside and take my seat with Bella and Sandy when I noticed someone in the domestics department section of the stockroom . At first I thought it was a member of the inventory team , sent to the store for the day , then saw the gold vest , white shirt , and bow tie , and realized it was one of the servers . A girl , twenty years old , maybe , leaning heavily against the big shelving unit . <p> She did n't look so good . <p> I walked over , and the closer I got , the worse she looked . Sweaty , yet flushed , palm on her stomach like she might throw up . <p> " Need some help ? " I asked . <p> She jumped as if I startled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm fine , " she insisted . " I 'm great . Just great . " <p> " No offense , but you look like crap , " I said . <p> She gulped hard , as if she was trying to keep something down . " I 'll be okay . I-I will . " <p> I could tell she did n't believe it-and I certainly did n't believe it-so I nodded toward the food station where the salads were being plated . <p> " I 'll go tell them you 're sick and you need to go home . " <p> " No ! " she said , suddenly springing toward me . " Do n't do that . You 'll get me in all sorts of trouble . I need this job . If I do n't finish out the day , I do n't get paid . And I 'll never get hired again . " <p> " Yeah , but if you 're sick- " <p> " Look , I need the money . I 've got school and rent and everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , job problems . It all seemed eerily familiar . <p> But I could n't let this girl get sick and ruin the day . The store employees had been through a lot these past few months . They deserved a nice luncheon , a sneak peek at the spring line , and a prize raffle in a vomit-free environment . <p> Plus , Holt 's had gone to a lot of trouble and expense to set this up . That witch Sarah Covington-Ty thought the world revolved around her , he let her intrude on everything , and I do mean everything - had put a great deal of effort into it . <p> And Ty was my boyfriend . Sort of . This was his store , his luncheon , his reputation . I could n't just stand there and do nothing . <p> " I 'll serve for you , " I said . <p> Her eyes widened-they looked really watery . " You ca n't do that- " <p> " I 've done it before , " I told her , which was n't true , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was set plates on the table . <p> Besides , I knew the caterer , sort of . Marilyn **26;126;TOOLONG had catered several events I 'd attended ; plus , I 'd seen her at my mom 's house-Mom certainly was n't going to cook at her own dinner party . <p> I was sure Marilyn did n't know who I was , but if I mentioned Mom-something I rarely do-I knew she 'd be okay with me filling in , rather than be shorthanded or have the server barf all over everything . <p> " It will be fine , " I told her . " Just give me your vest and tie , and take off . Nobody ever looks at the wait staff , anyway . I doubt anybody will even notice . " <p> I knew my friends outside would notice . But so what ? I 'd just tell them I 'd spit in their dessert if they gave me a hard time . <p> " Look , " I said , " if you throw up in the food , they 'll send you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus , they wo n't hire you again . " <p> She stewed on that for about a minute , then gave me her vest and tie , and slipped away . <p> I dashed up the big concrete stairs to the second floor of the stockroom , feeling pretty good about myself that I 'd done something to help out that girl . And I 'd probably saved the entire promotional event . Ty would surely be impressed . Sarah Covington would n't have done what I was doing . <p> I 'll have to work that into the conversation with Ty , somehow . <p> In the juniors section of the stockroom I pulled a white blouse off a hanger-just why on earth Holt 's carried white blouses , I did n't know . No one was in the stockroom-it was off-limits to employees today and the inventory team was still working in the store-so I changed into the blouse , put on the vest , which was a little big but oh well , and the bow tie , and got back downstairs in time to grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at me go . Making the big decisions , putting them into action-and I did n't even have my bachelor 's degree yet . <p> Then I froze at the top of the loading dock stairs . <p> Oh my God . Oh my God . <p> There stood Claudia Gray . <p> Claudia Gray . Gorgeous-and I mean gorgeous - poised , confident , beauty queen , and high fashion model Claudia Gray . <p> Not only did she know my mother , not only did she know all of my mother 's friends , but she was Ty 's ex-girlfriend . <p> Oh my God . Now I thought I might throw up . <p> What was she doing here ? Then I saw her talking to some of the models and realized she must be their pageant coach . <p> I ducked back into the loading dock , nearly causing a pileup among the servers behind me . <p> I could n't go out there . I could n't . Claudia looked fabulous , and I had on a caterer 's uniform . <p> What if Claudia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's megabitchy pack of backstabbing friends-that she saw me here ? At Holt 's ? <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
