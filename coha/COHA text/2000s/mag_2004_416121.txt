" Just once , I wish he would ask me something easy , such as , " What 's the most dependable tree for fall color in the South ? " My answer would be short and sweet-Japanese maple .

But if you 're buying your first Japanese maple , you 'll want to brush up on some basic information so you can make a wise choice .

Both standard and laceleaf types have beautiful selections of both colors . The foliage of red-leaved trees emerges a glowing red in spring and then usually fades to burgundy-green in summer before turning deep red in fall .
