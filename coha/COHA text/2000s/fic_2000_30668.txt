troll n. 1 . Obsolete . A creature of Scandinavian myth , sometimes portrayed as a mischievous or friendly dwarf , sometimes as a destructive giant , living in caves in the hills . 2 . A cyborg fighting machine of the Shirmaksu Empire . Norwegian , from Old Norse trll , monster . Webster- Wangchi Unabridged Dictionary of Standard English Tomas y Hijos , Publishers 2465 , Terran Standard Reckoning TNS Defender , flagship of BatDiv Ninety-Two , was forty light-months from anywhere in particular , loafing along under half drive and no more than four or five translations into alpha-space , when the atonal shriek of General Quarters howled through her iron bones . Her crew froze for one incredulous moment . Ridiculous ! They were headed for the barn , and the Kangas were penned up in a miserable three star systems , the nearest of them almost exactly one hundred light-years away . What kind of nit-picking silliness could have possessed the Old Lady to call a drill now ? Then wonder was forgotten as they thundered to their stations . Colonel Ludmilla Leonovna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immersed in the new history text on her book-viewer when the alarm 's high-pitched shriek jerked her away . She was into the passageway outside her quarters before she realized she 'd moved , and halfway to the hangar deck before she remembered she 'd left the viewer on . She made a sliding turn around the final bend , ricocheted from a bulkhead inan experienced rebound trajectory , and emerged into the cavernous hangar to find her flight crews already assembling . " Make a hole ! " Personnel scattered as they recognized her voice , and she went through the sudden opening and into the ready room like a more-or-less guided projectile , then came to a rocking halt beside the duty intelligence officer bent over the battle plot repeater . His face was intent , and her own lips pursed in a silent whistle as her eyes joined his on the crawling light dots on the screen . Her left hand rose to touch the ribbons on her tunic as if in memory , but she caught herself and lowered it deliberately , concentrating on the plot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very odd .... Commodore Josephine Santander 's stern , composed face appeared on Captain Steven Onslow 's com screen almost before the echoes of the alarm had died , though he knew she 'd been in her quarters when it sounded . " Talk to me , Steve , " she said without preamble . " Scan reports a Kanga force closing slowly from about sixty light-hours , Ma'am . Azimuth one-four-niner , elevation two-niner-three . I do n't have a firm track yet , but it looks like they 'll cross our wake about twenty light-hours behind us . Preliminary IDs look like an Ogre with escorts . " " An Ogre ? " Commodore Santander allowed herself a raised eyebrow . " Yes , Ma'am . It Just a moment , Ma'am . " He glanced at a side screen connecting him directly to Central Scanning , and his black face tightened . " We 're getting better data now , Ma'am . Scan confirms the Ogre . It 's a full battle squadronso far we 've picked up three Trollheims siding her . " " I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched a button , and the big holo tank on the flag bridge lit with a three-dee duplicate of his own display . Commodore Santander studied it for a moment . " We 've got their course , Ma'am , " Onslow said , and a thin red line appeared on the plot , predicting the hostile force 's movements . " They 're pulling about four lights relative and translating steadily . " " Gradient ? " the commodore asked sharply . " Steep , Ma'am . They 're eight or nine translations out already . The computer estimates they 'll break the beta wall in he glanced at his readouts " about five hours . " Commodore Santander frowned and swung her command chair slowly from side to side . It was unlike the Kangas to pile on that sort of gradient . They must be in one hell of a hurry to run that big a risk of acoherency . She wished there were someone she could turn this over to , but Admiral Wierhaus had detached only half of Battle Squadron Ninety for a badly needed overhaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were just over three light-years out of 36 Ophiuchi , and no one closer than the fleet base there could have taken the responsibility for her . She sighed silently . What she wished did n't change what she had . " All right , Steve . Get Commander Tho to work on a pursuit course . Maximum drive and optimum translation curve . " " Optimum , Ma'am ? " Onslow asked carefully . " You heard me . Toss out the safety interlocks . They would n't be translating that fast if they were n't in a hurry , and there would n't be three Trollheims riding herd on them if it was n't important . So get that course worked out soonest , then put the squadron on it . " " Aye , aye , Ma'am , " Captain Onslow said just a bit too expressionlessly , and Santander turned back to her plot , forcing herself to project an aura of confidence . She understood his unhappiness at pushing the multi-dimensional drive that hard and only wished she had another choice . Unfortunately , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Einsteinian limit held true , more or less , in normal-space . As it happened , the most recent hypotheses suggested that there were ways around that after allin theory , at leastbut the relativity aspects still turned theoretical physicists ' hair white . Until they worked the bugs out ( if they worked the bugs out ) practical spacers would stick with something which at least let them predict the decade of their arrival . Theoretically , the multi-dee was an elegant solution . If light-speed was inescapable , simply find yourself another dimension in which space was " folded " more tightly , bringing equivalent points " closer " together . That was a horribly crude description , but the commodore had yet to meet anyone who could describe it any better without resorting to pure math models . For her purposes , it worked well enough to visualize the galaxy of the FTL-traveler as consisting of concentric rings of dimensions ; by moving " higher " in multi-dimensional space , a ship translated itself into rings with shorter and shorter radii , which meant that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The physicists assured her she was n't really moving at more than light-speed , but the practical result was FTL travel . Still , there were limitations . The multi-dee was unusable inside the " Frankel Limit , " a flexible point in stellar gravity wells which varied widely depending on spectral class and vessel mass , and though one theoretically could simply translate directly from normal-space into whatever other dimension one chose to use and vice versa , it was far wiser to translate gradually from one to another . Dimensional energy flux could be vicious , and many things could happen to people who took liberties with the multi-dee . Few were pleasant . The alpha bandthe " lowest " of allwas only about twenty dimensions across . At its upper limit , the maximum effective velocity of a ship ( relative to normal-space ) was about five times light-speed . Higher bands offered greater effective speeds , but at the cost of increasingly unstable energy states and consequently increasing risk to the ship . And there were barriers , still imperfectly understood , between the bands that meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the wall just wrong or with the slightest harmonic in her translation field , she simply disappeared . She went acoherent , spread over a multitude of dimensions and forever unable to reconstitute herself , a thought which broke a cold sweat on the most hardened spacehound , for no one knew what happened inside the ship . Did the crew die ? Did they go into some sort of stasis ? Or did they gradually discover what had happened ... and that they had become a galactic Flying Dutchman for all eternity ? Not that there was too much danger in the lower bands . Humans routinely used the beta band , or even the gamma and delta bands , though Kanga vessels ventured as high as the delta band only when speed was of over-riding importance . But no one in his right mind hit the wall as fast and as hard as BatDiv Ninety-Two would have to in order to overhaul these Kangas . Not if they had a choice . " Course laid in , Ma'am , " Captain Onslow said tonelessly . " Then execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aye , Ma'am . " Defender shuddered as her normal-space drive went suddenly to full power . It felt smooth enough , but Santander knew how dreadfully overdue for overhaul Defender was , and she spared the time for a silent prayer against drive flutter as Defenders three million tons wrapped themselves in the n-drive 's space-twisting web and swung in a radical course change . The drive surge was disorienting despite the grav compensators , and the light dots of Defender s two sister ships and their escorts followed her on the plot as the under-strength battle division swerved to pursue humanity 's mortal enemies across the trackless depths of more than a single space . Mangled ions streamed astern as their massive drives wailed up to max , and the high-pitched whine of the multi-dee generators sang in their bones . " Time to the wall ? " Santander let no awareness of the state of Defenders drive color her question , and Onslow hid a wry , mental grimace of appreciation for her projected sangfroid . " Fourteen hours , Ma'am , " he replied . " Rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute speed differential in about ten hours , Ma'am . If they were to maintain their present gradient , we 'd need over eighty standard hours to match bands . I ca n't give you a realistic estimate without knowing when they 're going to level out . " " I do n't think they 're going to , " Santander said softly . " But they 'll break the gamma wall in fifty hours at this rate ! " " That 's a heavy force , Captain , a long way from home and in a hell of a hurry . I think they 're headed for the delta bandmaybe even higher . " " But , Ma'amthey 're Kangas ! " Onslow protested . " True . But they know they 're losing , too . They would n't pull this big a force off the Line unless its mission was critical , and their current gradient is a pretty good indication of the risks they 're willing to run . " " Yes , Ma'am , " Onslow said finally , clearly taken aback by the whole idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly . " I know you ca n't nail it down , but define a general volume for me . As soon as you can , please join Commander Miyagi , Colonel Leonovna and me in the flag briefing room . I 've got a bad feeling about this . " " Aye , aye , Ma'am , " Captain Onslow said . He watched his gray-haired commodore 's screen blank , and his heart was cold as the vacuum beyond Defender s hull . He had served with Commodore Santander off and on for ten subjective years . He 'd seen her in the screaming heart of battle and listened to her voice snapping orders while her ship bucked and jerked under the enemy 's pounding , and this was the first time she had ever admitted the least uncertainty .... Commodore Santander 's eyes narrowed as Captain Onslow stepped through the briefing room hatch . He looked shaken , and she braced herself for bad news as she waved him to a chair between the two officers already at the table . Plump , fair Commander Nicolas Miyagi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood of nervous energy poorly suited to his appearance made him an excellent planning officer . Colonel Leonovna , however , was much more than that . Indeed , she was something of a legend in the fleet , and , at a moment like this , Santander was profoundly grateful for her presence . Commodore Santander had never resented the colonel , but she understood why some did . Leonovna was twenty bio-years older than the commodore , but she looked a quarter of her age in her impeccable Marine uniform . The colonel would never be accused of classic beauty , but her wedge-shaped , high-cheekboned face was striking , and her bright chestnut hair and blue eyes might have been designed expressly to contrast with her space-black tunic . Yet for all her undeniable attractiveness , Santander reminded herself , Leonovna was lethal . Her golden pilot 's wings bore three tiny stars , each representing ten fighter kills , but the ribbons under those wings told the true story . They were headed by one the commodore had seen on precisely three officers during her entire career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it entitled Colonel Leonovna to a salute from any officer who had n't won it , regardless of rankand , as far as Josephine Santander was concerned , that was an honor to which she was more than welcome . But that was n't why so many people resentedand fearedthe colonel . Oh , no . Those reactions stemmed from something else entirely , for Ludmilla Leonovna was descended from the Sigma Draconis First Wave . The commodore shook herself free of her thoughts and cocked an eyebrow at Onslow . " May I assume you have more information now , Steve ? " " Yes , Ma'am . There 's still room for error , but the computers make it an Ogre , three Trollheims , and one Grendel , plus escorts . There may be a Harpy out there , too . " She nodded calmly , but her mind was anything but calm . A single Ogre was badalmost five million tons , with the firepower to sterilize a planetbut the Trollheims were worse . Far less massive ( they were actually slightly smaller than Defender ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " crewed " by servomechanisms slaved to the cyborgs humans called " Trolls . " A Grendel assault transport was bad news for any planet , for it carried an entire planetary assault force of Trolls and their combat mechs , but it meant little in a deep space battle . By the same token , the possibility of a Harpy-class interceptor carrier made a bad situation very little worse , for she could be only a spectator until and unless the action translated down into the alpha or lower beta band . But any way Santander looked at it , BatDiv Ninety-Two was out-gunned and out-massedbadlyand she was far from certain the traditional human technical advantage could balance these odds . Yet suspicion stuck in her mind like a sliver of glass . The Kangas would never have wandered this far from the desperate defense of their three remaining systems unless they were engaged in something of supreme importance to their ultracautious race . " That 's a heavy weight of metal , " was all she said softly . " Agreed , " Onslow said grimly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , Ma'am ; they 're headed for Sol . " " Sol ? " Miyagi sat straighter , his blue eyes sharp . " That 's insane ! Home Fleet will blow them to plasma a light-month out ! " " Will they ? " Leonovna spoke for the first time , looking like a teenager in her mother 's uniform as she raked chestnut hair back from her forehead . " What about their gradient , Captain ? Is it holding steady ? " " No , " Onslow said , " it 's still rising . I 've never heard of anything like it . I would n't have believed a Kanga multi-dee could crank out that much power if I was n't seeing it . We 're wound up to max ourselves , and we 're only reducing the differential slowly . " " That 's what I was afraid of . " Leonovna turned back to the commodore . " Could they be looking for a Takeshita Translation , Ma'am ? " There was a moment of dead silence . Trust the colonel to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought had crossed my mind , " she admitted , and touched her com button . " Navigation , " she told the computer , and Commander Tho appeared on her screen . Santander was normally a stickler for courtesy and proper military procedure , but this time she did n't even give Tho time to acknowledge her call . " Assuming present power levels remain constant , Commander , she said without preamble , " where will our Kangas break the theta wall ? " " The theta wall ? " Commander Tho sounded surprised . " Just a moment , Ma'am . " He looked down at his terminal to make calculations , then looked back up . " Assuming they do break it , Ma'am , they 'll be two-point-one light-months from Sol with a normal-space velocity just over twelve hundred lights . But " " Thank you , Commander . " Santander stopped him with a courteous nod , then switched off and looked around the briefing room . There was tension in every face , and she noted tiny beads of sweat at Onslow 's temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel , that you 're onto something , " she said . " And that , people , leaves us with a little problem . " Silence answered her , and she turned back to Onslow . " You say we 're closing the differential on them , Captain . How long before we can bring them into MDM range ? " " Normally , we 'd have the range in about " he glanced at his memo comp " thirty-two hours , but their gradient 's a bitch . Their translation curve is flattening , but so is ours . We 've never seen a Kanga multi-dee run at this output , so I ca n't predict when their gradient will max out . It looks like we still have the edge , but we 're into emergency over-boost now . " He did not add that no one ever used emergency over-boost , even on acceptance trials , and certainly not with drives in need of overhaul . Such demands on the multi-dee generators tremendously multiplied the chance of setting up a disastrous harmonic between them and the normal-space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay coherent , " he went on , " I 'd guesstimate that we should be able to range on them dimensionally in about two hundred hours . " " And at that time we 'll be where , dimensionally speaking ? " " Well up into the eta band , Ma'am . And " he frowned " as far as I know , no one 's ever used MDMs above the delta band . Gunnery is n't sure what effect that will have on the weapons . " " It looks like we 're going to find out . " Santander forced herself to speak calmly . " If Colonel Leonovna is rightand I think she isthey 're headed for a Takeshita Translation . I know no one 's ever tested the theory , but we have to assume that 's what they 're doing . If so , we know where they 're headed . The question is when . Comments ? " " I 'm no dimensional physicist , Ma'am , " Colonel Leonovna said after a moment , " but as I understand it , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mass of the vessel , the gradient curve and subjective velocity during translation , the deformation of the multi-dee ... " She raised her hands , palms up . " All we can say is that if Takeshita 's First Hypothesis is right , they 'll flip backward in time when they hit the wall and go on translating backward until they hit Sols Frankel Limit . " " You 're overlooking a few points , Milla , " Miyagi said . " Like his Second Hypothesis , whether or not time is mutable , or whether or not anyone can survive a Takeshita Translation in the first place . " His tone was argumentative , but he was punching keys on his console as he spoke . " True , " Commodore Santander said , " but we have to assume they can do it unless we stop them . We ca n't afford to be wrongnot about this one . " " Agreed , Ma'am . " Miyagi nodded . " And Colonel Leonovna 's pretty much right about the problems , but we can make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they 'll have to balance their multi-dee deformation to match the mass-power curve of the Trollheims multi-dees and n-drives .... " He tapped keys quickly , and the others sat silent to let him work undisturbed . It took several minutes , but he finally looked up with a grim expression . " Commodore , it 's approximate as hell , but it looks like they 'll hit the Frankel Limit something on the order of 40,000 years in the past . Could be closer to 90,000 if they lose the Trollheims . " " They wo n't . " Colonel Leonovna shook her head . " Kangas are sure-thing players , " she said softly . " They 'll want to be sure Homo sapiens is around . " " Of course , " Commodore Santander murmured . She sat wrapped in her thoughts for a few moments , then shook herself . " Captain Onslow , pass the word to the other skippers , please . If Defender goes acoherent , whoever 's left has to know this is for all the marbles . Breaking off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma'am , " Onslow said quietly . " Very well . I think you can stand the crews down from action stations until we reach effective MDM range , but keep your scanner sections closed up in case they try a surprise launch down-gradient . " " Agreed , Ma'am . " " Nick " she turned to Miyagi " warm up the simulator . As soon as the Captain has everybody tucked in , we 'll start working on tactics . " She smiled without a trace of humor . " We 're not exactly the War College , but we 're all humanity has at the moment . " Colonel . " She met Leonovna 's blue eyes levelly . " I hope we wo n't have anything for you to do , but if we do , it 'll be one hell of a dogfight . Inform the squadron commanders on the other ships , then get with your planning officers . Work out the best balance you can between antishipping and antifighter ordnance loads . Then make sure every interceptor is one hundred percent . We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma'am . " " All right , people , " Santander sighed , rising from her chair . " Carry on . And if you find yourself with any spare time " she managed a wan smile " spend it reminding God whose side He 's on . "
