God Went to Beauty School He went there to learn how to give a good perm and ended up just crazy about nails so He opened up His own shop . " Nails by Jim " He called it . He was afraid to call it Nails by God . He was sure people would think He was being disrespectful and using His own name in vain and nobody would tip . He got into nails , of course , because He 'd always loved hands  - -  hands were some of the best things He 'd ever done and this way He could just hold one in His and admire those delicate bones just above the knuckles , delicate as birds ' wings , and after He 'd done that awhile , He could paint all the nails any color He wanted , then say , " Beautiful , " and mean it .
