Magic takes many forms . In recent years , we 've seen " White Magic , " " Black Magic for Dummies , " and " Magic for Beginners . " Now Mr. Reed contributes his own tale of supernatural arts with this inquiry into some of the shadowy recesses of human sexuality . Despite the title of this tale , parents might want to vet this one before sharing it with youngsters . <p> THEY DO LOVE TO TALK . There always has to be conversation before , and afterward , unless they 're deeply drunk , words are pretty much mandatory . Nothing makes women happier than hours of empty , soulbaring chatter . There 's even a few of them that need to talk while they 're doing it . Of course their words get awfully simple , if it 's during . They grunt out commands and sometimes encouragement , and a few favorite phrases are repeated with predictable rhythm . But if a man can hold his cadence , and if he knows what she likes , it is n't boring . Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of pleasure , or maybe a huge amount of pleasure . Then it 's finished , preferably for him and for her both , and everyone gets a few moments of silence marked with wet breathing and spiritual insights . " Ted ? " " Yeah ? " " Are you awake ? " " No , I 'm not . " " No ? " " Hey - ! " " Are you awake now , Ted ? " " That fingernail - ! " Without a trace of sorrow in her voice , she says , " Sorry . " Then after a deep sigh , she asks , " What are you thinking ? " " Nothing . " " Liar . " " Okay . You caught me . " " So what 's on your mind ? " " You . " " Good answer . " Good enough to earn a few moments of uninterrupted quiet . " Ted ? " " Who ? " She ignores his response . " I have a question , " she announces . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when . A couple weeks , at least .... " " What 's the question ? " " Do you believe ? " " In what ? " " Anything at all , " she says . He says , " Gravity , " and laughs for a moment . " I wholeheartedly believe in the abiding force of gravity . " " That 's not what I mean , " she warns . " I 'm talking about faith . In God and that sort of stuff . " " Stuff ? " " You know what I mean . " " Stuff . " " Do you accept things you ca n't see ? Forces and powers that exist outside the realm of pure reason ? " " Gravity , " he repeats . " Do n't joke , Ted . " " I mean that . " He sounds sincere and perhaps a little angry . " Most of human history has been lived happily without the concept of gravity . People never imagined that bodies in space attract each other . Even with Newton 's equations ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Einstein 's work still do n't address every condition in our universe , much less in those other realms that may or may not exist . " A hand waves in the darkness . " Fine . Gravity . " " Here 's something else to consider , " he says . " We ca n't tell for certain that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass . It 's impossible to do the necessary research . I mean , yes , the Earth pulls down on us . And two metal balls suspended on delicate wires will attract one another in the proper way . But what about two naked people sprawled out on sweaty sheets ? That work has never been done in the laboratory . Who knows if the law of nature holds in our circumstances ? " He laughs again , briefly . " So really , you can see , this business about gravity is one enormous leap of faith . " She says , " Sorry . " " Apology accepted . " A pause . " Anything else ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else you have faith in ? " " Oh , sure . " " Are you going to say , " Evolution ' ? " " Hardly , " he says . " Natural selection has been proven more thoroughly and far more convincingly than gravity has ever been . " " Okay . What about magic in general ? " " What about it ? " " Do you believe in it ? " " In magic ? " " Do you understand the question ? " He sighs . " You ca n't accept magic , " she decides . " Think not ? " " Judging by your tone - " " You ca n't read my tone , and I 'd bet anything you ca n't read my mind . Little Miss **37;4050;TOOLONG . " " Sorry . " He takes a long moment , then asks , " What do you mean by " magic ' ? " " Anything and everything that 's miraculous , " she begins , with feeling . " Magic is everything that should n't happen . Magic can conjure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " ' From nothing , ' " he repeats . " Magic has rituals and rules . And when it has real power , magic can harm the weak and the sloppy . But there always must be a few great wizards in our world , and with their spells , they achieve wonders . That 's why magic exists . That 's why it is something worth treasuring . " " Yes . " " What ? " " I said , " Yes . ' " " You buy the idea of magic and spells ? " " Very much so . " " All right . What kinds of magic ? " After a moment , he says , " No . " " What ? " " I wo n't tell you . " " You will too . " " Why ? You want to hear about my little run-in with the mystical world ? " " Of course . " " Okay then . I was thirteen . " She says nothing .

" " Okay , " she squeaks . He takes one final deep breath . " I was with my best friends , " he says , " and one day , seemingly by accident , we happened across a magical book . " They were playing in a woodlot behind their subdivision . Ted had seen a fox the night before - a beautiful graceful dream of an animal and with the help of his two closest friends , he was searching for the fox 's den . What the boys would do when they found it , he had no idea . But the hunt managed to hold everybody 's interest for nearly an hour , leaving the three of them hot and thirsty , and ready for some new adventure . That 's when Phillip found a backpack tucked under a juniper tree . Scott did n't approve . " You should have left it there , " was his opinion . " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Phillip was the brave one in their group . Scott believed in rules and obedience , while Ted was somewhere between . Exactly where he fit depended on the day and his mood . " Do n't you want to see what 's inside ? " Phillip asked . Then he shook the pack , something with heft bouncing inside . " No , " Scott said . " That is n't ours - " " But maybe there 's an ID , " Ted mentioned . " We 'll find the owner and give it back , and maybe even split the reward . " The rationale meant something to Scott . Sensing something fun , Phillip did n't want any owner to be found , but it served his needs to nod confidently , saying , " Yeah , let 's look for a driver 's license or something . " The pack was old , the gray-green nylon fabric thin as tissue in places , a couple tears mended with rusted safety pins . The object was dirty enough to show that it had been outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been if it were exposed to last week 's heavy rains . The back pocket had been left open , Phillip discovered . It was empty . The zipper to the main pocket fought his tugging , but he managed to pull it open far enough to look inside , turning the pack to where it could fill with sunshine . Many years later , Ted would still remember his friend 's face changing . The blue eyes just lit up , and a mouth that was usually held in a tight smirk fell open . Then a small , deeply impressed voice said , " Not here . " " What is it ? " Scott asked . Phillip clamped both hands over the open pack , sealing in the contents . " Back this way , " he said . " In the gully . " Better than anyone else in the world , those three boys knew the local terrain . It took several minutes , but once they stopped running , they were out of sight of every human eye in Creation , squatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triangle around this most unexpected treasure . " Okay , " Phillip said , releasing his hands . " What is it ? " Scott inquired , leaning back warily . " Take a look , " Phillip said to Ted . Whatever was inside , Ted guessed that it was n't dangerous . At least it would n't bite or explode . So he reached in blindly , feeling a stack of thick paper bound together with fat rubber bands . Then just for fun , he faked pain , jumping back as if a set of fangs had stabbed his fingers . " Oh , crap ! " Scott blurted , tumbling onto his butt . Ted laughed at his cowardly friend , and then he pulled out a stack of photographs . Suddenly every boy was staring at the top image . Even Phillip , who knew what to expect , was staring . Everybody took a small step back , and Ted dropped the discovery on the dusty ground . And all these years later , he could still see the contorted face of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the faceless man was obviously doing to her . " Porn , " she says . He does n't respond . " I thought you were talking about magic , " she complains . " Not just some dirty pictures . " " I told you , " he says . " I was thirteen . " " Yeah , I remember . " " A new-born adolescent . " She decides not to speak . " You wo n't understand , " he says . " You ca n't . Even if I was to tell you the whole story - " " I thought you just did . " " No . That 's just the beginning . I was setting the scene . The important stuff comes later . " " Is that a pun ? " " Do you want to hear this , or not ? Because I do n't have to tell it . " " I 'm listening , " she promises . " Go on . " But he does n't say one word . Not immediately . He seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he finally does speak , he does so slowly , cautiously , as if at any moment , given the tiniest excuse , he will stop talking and never again say one word about this intimate subject . The boys quickly recovered from their shock . Phillip knelt and studied the top image . Then he wiped both hands against his sweaty shin , and with the others close beside him , he touched the page . The photograph had been glued to a sheet of what looked like thin cardboard , stiff and pale gray , larger than the picture and cut to size with long scissors . Two fat red rubber bands held the book together . Phillip removed the top band and then its partner , taking the trouble to place both inside the empty pack . Then he paused and grinned , enjoying a quick deep breath before turning the page . The next photograph was smaller , and it was black-and-white , and it was nearly as memorable as the first . A different girl was holding herself in a completely different position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silvery-white glow that was at least as captivating as what she was doing . The man seemed to be the same man , judging by the proportions of his body . But the bed was different , and the room around the bed too , and if it was the same camera as before , it was being used in a very different fashion . The third page had four color Polaroid pictures set in a specific order , each equally faded by time . This time , there was no man . But again , the girl was fresh . She looked young and exceptionally tall , but like the first two women , she seemed to be wholly oblivious to a camera , busily doing things with herself that were as bizarre as they were captivating . In all , there were thirty pages . The boys counted the photographs and arrived at several general conclusions : Each page held a different girl , and when a man was visible , he was probably the same man , or at least a fellow with a similar body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age or build , and sometimes not even in their race . The only similarity was that each of them was young , and in some fashion , lovely . About their lover , nothing seemed exceptional . Even boys of thirteen had enough experience in the world to feel sure about that . The man 's legs were not lean or particularly muscular , nor was any dimension about his body anything but average . Whenever he was standing , his stomach looked pudgy . Perhaps he had handsome features , but there was no way to tell since his face was out of view . But the women 's faces were always visible ; with each astonishing image , it was the face that the boys " eyes were drawn to first . Among the three of them , Phillip had the most experience with pornography . His older brother had amassed a considerable library of Playboys and Penthouses and even a few Hustlers . And most important , Phillip had a practical smartness about things most thirteen-year-olds never even thought about . " This does n't make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book now , slowly , page by delicious page . " What do you ... ? " His voice faded , hands adjusting the fit of his jeans . " What does n't make sense ? " " Each one 's different , " Phillip said . Ted was staring at the faces and breasts and other stretches of honest , captivating anatomy , committing details to a memory that would never again function at this very high level . " He 's got to be some kind of stud , " Scott replied , aching with envy . " Whoever he is , the guy knows how to get girls . " " I do n't mean the different girls , " Phillip said . " I mean the cameras . " Confused , the other boys glanced at their friend . " We can check again . But I do n't think it 's ever the same camera twice , " Phillip continued . " Just like it 's not the same girl . And does that make sense ? " Ted had n't considered the matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who owns thirty cameras ? " Phillip flipped back up the Polaroid page . " You 're a stud , okay . And you like taking pictures . But who in the hell uses a new camera each time ? " " He 's rich , " Scott offered . " Which explains how he gets them , too . " Phillip shook his head . " Okay , he 's loaded . But why would a rich dude bother with a freakin " Polaroid ? " Ted began to appreciate the problem , although he could n't imagine that it meant much . What mattered were the photographs themselves . " Who do you think they belong to ? " he asked , trying to steer the topic . " And why put the book out here ? " Phillip pressed . " This is an adult . He 's got a house of his own , somewhere . Why stick this kind of thing in an old backpack and dump it in the middle of the woods ? " Ted had wondered about that problem , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was miles ahead of his friends . " I do n't care how many cameras were used , " he announced , " or why this was lost out here . This book belongs to us now . That 's what matters . " The cowardly , law-abiding boy had finally found something worth taking . Turning back to the first picture , he said , " What we need to do , right now ... we 've got to figure out what we 're doing with this wonderful gift . " He pauses again . After a long silence , she says , " I bet they were different men , each with his own camera . That would explain things . " Watching her , he says nothing . Then she nods , admitting , " But that 's a smart thing to notice . Perceptive and all . Your friend , Phillip , must have been a pretty sharp kid . I do n't know if I 'd pick up on it , if I was looking at dirty pictures . " " You never have ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah , I guess not . Women do n't like porn the same as men do . " " Tell me . " " We 're wired differently , " he says . " Visual stimulation is everything . Sometimes I think we 're the same species only because we 've got to interbreed . If not for that , men and women would just fly apart . " " That 's a pretty harsh assessment . " " And honest , " he says . She shrugs , returning to her explanation . " This was back when ? The early eighties , I 'm guessing . Even before the Internet , there were plenty of twisted men collecting twisted smut . There were networks where they could sell it and trade for it . Some guy with an obsession probably just gathered up a stack of dirty pictures where the men looked kind of the same . " " That 's one explanation . " " You have a better one ? " " A simpler , sharper explanation . Yes . " " And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each girl supplied the equipment . A variety of cameras and film , in a string of bedrooms and wherever . " " Then that was one incredibly smooth gentleman . " He says nothing . " ' Hey , honey . Pop a roll in your thirty-five-millimeter and set the timer . Let 's make a memento of tonight . ' " " Does n't sound reasonable to you ? " " Hardly , " she says . " And I know a little something about taking pictures , too . If these shots were half as good as you keep saying ... well , that means each woman took dozens , maybe hundreds of them . Because in my experience , even the best photographer needs luck when he 's using timers or a cord tied to the switch - " " Magic . " " What ? " " Do you remember ? That 's how we got on this subject , talking about spells and magic . " " Yeah , I remember - " " ' Conjuring up amazing things from nothing/ You said words like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . Is that what you 're telling me ? " " With rituals and rules , and a real power . Plus the capacity to do enormous harm , if that power 's left in the wrong hands . " " This is just stupid . " He says nothing . " Stupid , " she repeats . Then with a grudging curiosity , she asks , " So . Is there anything else to this dumb story ? " " You tell me : What else does magic involve ? " " Involve ? " " What have n't you seen so far ? " She hesitates . Then , warily , she says , " The wizard ? " And with that , he resumes his story . TOGETHER , the boys found a fresh hiding place for their treasure . In another portion of the woods was a discarded slab of old pavement , invisible from most vantage points but offering a clear view of the surrounding terrain . An earlier generation of boys had dug a deep dry hole beneath the slab . Rain would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid its presence . With the conviction of grown men , they drew up rules concerning the book : You had to sit above the hole for five minutes , making sure nobody had followed you . The book and bag had to stay in that one place . Each picture was to be handled carefully . And when you were done , you needed to make sure you were alone before hiding everything inside the same hole . For a week , that system worked well enough . Ted visited the book four or five times . Phillip went with him on the first visit , and they discovered Scott already there , sitting on the edge of the slab , long legs dangling in the speckled light . The next day , Ted went alone - his longest , most memorable visit - investing at least an hour examining one image after the next . Then there was another day when he hoped to be alone , but Scott caught him on the trail . His friend was a big kid , clumsy and pale , smart at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " Scott asked , almost running to catch up . " You know I was , " Ted replied . " You saw me - " " I mean today , " the boy added . It was n't even noon . " No , " Ted admitted . Then a premonition tickled him , and he asked , " How about you ? " " Once , " he admitted . " You mean today ? " " After breakfast , " Scott said , his face coloring and eyes growing distant . There was an addictive quality to those photographs . Even at thirteen , Ted found the effects both sickening and irresistible-a set of innate urges released by what was nothing more than chemical emulsions on sheets of fancy paper . He could n't stop thinking about the girls and young women . Without trying , he would close his eyes and see not only their bodies but their faces , too , and in particular , their vivid eyes and pretty mouths that helped convey a set of expressions that were both remote and self-absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all possible circumstances , suddenly held potentials that Ted had never noticed . Actresses were more beautiful than ever , even the famous old ones . And the neighborhood women - the average wives and mothers who before this were no more than little portions of a humdrum landscape - had become miraculous creatures . The boy found himself staring at them , asking himself what kinds of wondrous , unlikely things these ordinary ladies did with their husbands . And worst of all were the teenage girls . A week earlier , Ted could have made inane conversation with most of them , feeling only a pleasant nervousness . But now the stakes were infinitely greater . He had trouble making eye contact , much less offering any coherent noise ; and his worst enemy was his own infected brain , constantly inventing ways to think about matters delicious and wrong . Phillip seemed less infected than Ted . Maybe his earlier exposure to dirty magazines acted like a vaccination , or perhaps it was just his natural man-of-the-world attitude . Whatever the reason , Phillip did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he pulled out the pictures , he noticed nonsexual details missed by his best friends . " This is the oldest photograph , " he told them . The image was black-and-white , but that did n't mean anything . Plenty of the pictures were black-and-white . Ted took hold of the photo and lifted it up to the light . The quality was obvious . Family portraits had the same perfect flash and glossy finish . " But why 's this the oldest ? " " Look here . " A crooked finger jabbed at the edge of the photograph . " see the calendar ? " In the background , something was hanging on the white wall . " You look at it . " His friend produced a magnifying glass , pressing it into Ted 's hand . " Try and read the month and year . " May 1938 . " Let me see , " Scott said . But instead of reading the date , he used the glass to study the fine details of the woman 's body . " So there 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about these hair styles ? " Phillip flipped between examples . " This one looks like it 's from the forties , and this has to be today , and this one back here .. . it sure looks like what's-her-name 's hair . From the beach movies . " He meant Sandra Dee or Gidget . One of those girl-next-door girls . " There 's thirty years of pictures here , " Phillip said . The idea was unsettling , sure . But Ted pretended not to care . " The guy has been busy , " he argued . " That 's all that means . " Flipping back to the oldest photograph , Phillip pointed out , " This belly here ... it does n't look like a twenty-year-old belly . " " That 's a different guy , " Ted offered . " An earlier pervert . " " Except it is n't . " Phillip had invested a great deal of time to the study , measuring the male 's legs and belly , and everything else that was visible . Pointing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then flipped to another black-and-white shot . " This is probably the newest photograph , " he continued . " see ? The same exact mark . And the body looks exactly the same as before . " Ted did n't like looking at the man 's bare leg . Scott claimed the new photograph , and again , he used the magnifying glass on the woman . Without question , Scott was sicker than his buddies . Three or four times every day , he devised some excuse to slip out of his house and down to the woods for just one more look . He had admitted that he could n't sleep through the night anymore , and that he was rubbing himself raw . There were moments when the kid seemed to be willing himself to dive inside one of those inviting , addictive images . " Look at this , " said Scott . " Look at her close . " He set the new picture and magnifying glass into Ted 's hands . As it happened , this was Ted 's favorite image . The clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judging by the woman 's arching back , she was enjoying herself . Enthralled , she had twisted her head around as far as possible , looking up at the camera , her long straight hair plunging away from her face , leaving her features more than half visible - a woman filled with a mixture of determined concentration and utter bliss . Ted 's breathing quickened whenever he saw her . " Look close , " Scott repeated . With the glass , Ted started to count the neat knobby bumps that defined that wondrous spine . " No , her face . That 's what you need to see . " But he already had . A hundred times , at least . It was a long elegant face carrying a joyful , almost religious pleasure that he only hoped he could give to his future wife , at least once in her life . " You 're not seeing it , " Scott complained . Phillip had to ask , " What are we supposed to see ? " " This woman , " Scott blurted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , crap . " She 's that blond lady with twins . Remember ? She and her husband moved in last winter , while she was still pregnant .... " " Was it ? " " Was it what ? " " Her . That mom with twins . " He says , " I had n't realized it until then . But it sure looked like her , yeah . " " Well , I guess that 's not too surprising , " she decides . " Since whoever took those pictures probably lived somewhere close . " " Not surprising at all , " he agrees . " But you know what does surprise me , hearing this ? " " I think I can make a good guess . " " The years . " He makes a neutral sound . " They do n't add up right . " He says nothing . A long , thoughtful pause ends with the declaration , " That 'll have to wait , I guess . " Then she says , " Go on and tell me : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbor 's house . Ted particularly kept tabs on it . The ordinary split-level stood across the street , two lots removed from Ted 's bedroom window . With binoculars , he could see the front yard and pan of the back . In those first four mornings , the young husband emerged before seven-thirty . He was a tall man , far too skinny to be the fellow in the pictures . He would happily kiss his babies good-bye and hug his adulterous wife before driving off to the city . Then around nine or nine-thirty , the young woman would put the babies into her car and run a few errands , returning before noon with a trunk full of shopping sacks . It was that second morning , not long after she had vanished , that Ted went outside with a half-inflated football . He kicked it down the street and back again , and then he kicked it hard enough to drop it into her front yard . Then he pretended to shank the punt , placing the ball into the woman 's fenced backyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through the gate to recover what was his , and then slowly circled the rest of the house , peering into every window until he felt certain that the shag carpet in the finished basement was the same as the carpet visible in the photograph . The babies took naps after lunch , it seemed . That 's when the woman would step alone into the backyard , wearing a single-piece swimsuit and white paste on her pretty little nose . In the binoculars , she looked to be in her twenties , with tall legs and a little thickness around her waist . Her hair was long and straw-colored , and it could n't have been any straighter . For an hour or two , she would sit on a chaise lounge , not really sunbathing but enjoying her quiet time with magazines and little naps . Then she would step back inside , not appearing again until around six o'clock when her husband came home again . Except on the fourth day , things were different . Ted was sitting next to his window . It was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause in front of the woman 's house , shamelessly staring at the curtains . Then he strolled past Ted , glancing up with a possessed grin before heading for the woods and the backpack . A few minutes later , Phillip rode past on his bike , heading in the same direction . The woman still had n't appeared , and Ted began to suspect that she would n't . Maybe one of her babies could n't sleep . Whatever the reason , he felt a strong urge to follow his friends ; but then a pedestrian appeared down the block - a man of no particular description who was wearing nothing of note , walking up the slight slope and then pausing to glance both ways before crossing the street , never breaking stride , calmly walking along the driveway and up the concrete steps that led to the woman 's front door . The door opened and closed , seemingly of its own volition . The man had vanished . For as long as he could stand it , Ted waited . But his patience and strength only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the football and stepped outside , flinging it down the street and running after it , then picking the ball up again , trying hard to kick it exactly the same way as he did before . The football spiraled into the wrong backyard . Ted ignored his mistake . He lifted the latch of the woman 's gate , stepped through and carefully set it down again . The finished basement was at the back of the house , on the ground floor . Two days ago , the curtains had been pulled wide open , letting him stare through the sliding glass doors . But now they were pulled shut-heavy gray curtains bleached by sunshine - and for another minute or two , the boy stood on the concrete patio , trying to will the curtains to part , flooding the room with honest light . He thought about running away . Then came the sensation of being watched , and Ted turned slowly , looking at the adjacent houses . Had any neighbors seen him ? What kind of trouble was he going to be in now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand reached out . As if watching someone else 's fingers , he saw them grab hold of the warm steel handle of the door , and with a firm push , the unlocked door moved slightly . The stiff curtain bent toward him in response , cold air playing across his bare forearm . He took a moment to gather himself . Then his hand reached around the curtain , and he crept close and took a deep breath and held it , and tried to get so close that when he pulled the curtain aside , no sunlight would shine indoors . He would have his own little window on whatever was happening , and Ted was so sure of his plan that he did n't notice the touch of two fingers on the back of his hand . He was standing against the curtain and the fingers touched him and then pulled away , and he noticed their absence instead . Then he leaped back and watched in horror as a thick hairy hand-a hand almost as familiar as his own - pushed between the curtain and jamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locking it with a clear , sharp thunk . " Oh , God . " He does n't reply . " Go on . Sorry to interrupt . Go on . " Ted found his friends sitting on the slab of old concrete , huddled around their treasure . Scott had found the time to purchase his own magnifying glass - a bigger , better model . Phillip was using his glass to study another picture . No , that was n't what he was doing exactly . As Ted approached , he realized the boy had turned a picture over , and he was staring intently at the stiff gray backing . " What are you doing ? " Ted asked . Then before anybody could answer , he added , " I just saw our guy . I 'm sure it 's him . He 's with the blond right now , doing her . " Both boys looked up at him , visibly impressed . " Did you get to see them doing it ? " Scott asked . " Nearly , " was Ted 's reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started hunting for her photograph . Phillip had a clearer understanding of these matters . Waving his magnifying glass , he asked , " So you did n't see anything ? " " Not really . " " But he 's there now ? " " He was . Ten minutes ago . " Phillip tried to talk . " Maybe we should - " he managed to say . But then he interrupted himself , asking Ted , " Did you see our guy 's face ? " " Sort of . " Scott turned paler than ever , and he lifted his arm , pointing when he gasped , " Is that him ? " The man was standing fifty feet behind Ted . By all appearances , he was unremarkable - a smallish fellow of no particular age , with a modest gut and shaggy dark hair . His clothes were n't rich or special . His features would never be called handsome , and they were very nearly forgettable . But his eyes were hot and black and very small , and he managed to project an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want them back , " the stranger said slowly , firmly . Scott pulled the photographs into his lap . That made the man smile . He stepped closer , and even more quietly , he said , " They belong to me . " " So what the hell are they ? " Phillip asked . Then he answered his own question , admitting , " They 're not like any pom I 've seen . And this stuff they 're glued to - " " Yes ? " " I 've been looking . Close . " Phillip stood up - a small boy brandishing his magnifying glass as if it could serve as a weapon . " That backing of theirs . To me , it looks like dried skin . " Ted felt weak and cold . The man gave an appreciative nod . " Human skin , is it ? " " I 'll tell you , " the man said . " If you give all of those pictures back to me now . I 'll tell . " Phillip made up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scott 's grasp , shoving them into the backpack and tossing the pack underhand . The man caught the pack without letting those fiery eyes leave Phillip 's face . Then he explained , " Human skin does work and works very well , but there are substitutes . Easier to find , and a lot easier to use . " " Use for what ? " Ted muttered . " Well , " said the man , " to make a very strong soup . " " What do you want with soup ? " Scott blurted out skeptically . " I rather like to eat it . " Then he pulled a photograph from the pack the blond woman on her hands and knees , as it happened - and he said a few odd words before placing the corner of the photo 's backing into his own mouth , biting off a piece of the skin and swallowing it whole . The boys glanced at one another . Grinning , the man began to turn away . " Leave the pictures , " Scott begged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ageless wizard began to laugh . Quietly , he laughed at Scott and at all of them . " But what would be the point ? " he inquired . " The flesh is as seasoned as you can make it , my boys . My soup ca n't be any richer . My good boys . My dear little men . " Silence . Then she asks , " Is that it ? " " Pretty much , " he concedes . " The pervert ... the wizard ... what did he do next ? " " Just walked off and vanished . " " And did you ever see him again ? " " No . " She thinks for a long while . Then with a sigh , she says , " What year was that ? " " 1970 . In the summer . " " Thirty-seven years ago . " " Sure . " " And you should be in your fifties now . " He says nothing . " If this is true , " she says , and then she pulls back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you know ? " " If I can believe any of this . " " Nobody is making you , " he says . But then he points out , " You 're the one who openly and fervently believes in magic . " " You did n't find the wizard again ? " " I said I did n't . No . " " But that kind of magic ... with the skins backing the pictures , and those words that he said ... did you find out how to do the trick ... ? " In a certain way , he says nothing . " Ted ? " Nothing . " Ted ? " " What ? " " I have a camera . "
