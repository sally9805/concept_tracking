Julie Evans hangs out on the hammock with her two preschool-aged sons Will ( left ) and Sam ( right ) . // The five-year-old refuses to pick up her toys . The threeyear-old is whining for juice . Dinner needs to be fixed . Laundry is piling up ... and Supernanny is just a W program . When a parent has MS , there are no ordinary parenting challenges . By nature , preschoolers run till they drop , are unable to do many physical tasks for themselves , and are years from being able to understand concepts like chronic disease or invisible symptoms . All parents balance many things along with raising their children . There 's the household to keep in order , and often a full- or parttime career as well . A parent with MS may have all of these obligations-and the burden of managing whatever MS brings . Establishing limits for parent and child " My kids do n't understand when I say ' Mommy 's foot hurts ' , " said Julie Evans , mother of five-year-old Will and two-yearold Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My pain is n't the result of anything they can see . When they fall down , they know what ' hurt ' is , but they ca n't see what 's causing the pain I have . " " You ca n't explain MS to a preschoolage child , " said Peggy Crawford , PhD , clinical psychologist and director of health psychology at Cleveland Clinic 's Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research . " But you can talk about function using words they understand . You can say , ' My legs are too tired . I need to sit down a lot today ' . " When fatigue , vision problems , numbness , or spasticity get in the way , " Give children limited options , " Crawford suggested . " Say , ' I ca n't do this right now , but let 's do that , ' Offer a back-up activity so you 're not always saying no to them . Sometimes breaking activities into parts works : ' We can make cookies , but we 'll make the dough today and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special books , games , and videos in her bedroom . They are only for the days when she 's exhausted and needs more rest . Her children can climb on her bed and they can be together with these special things . Giving children limited choices " teaches good life lessons , " Crawford said . " It teaches them that they ca n't have everything they want exactly when they want it-but there are other choices . " Becoming an energy miser Fatigue , an all too common MS symptom , is especially difficult for parents of preschoolers . Jill Peterson , mother of threeyear-old Zachary , said , " The first two years were really rough . With all the sleep interruptions and physical effort of lifting and carrying him , I was always tired . Since he started walking , it has become easier . He can do more for himself . But some things can be a bit of a drain or difficult when I 'm tired , like getting him in and out of the car seat . Zachary ca n't do it completely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband is around he always does it . " It 's all about energy conservation . I 'm capable of meeting most physical demands , but if I try to do everything , I 'm in trouble . I 've learned to scale back , especially in the afternoons . My fatigue is not just the all-over-the-body kind , it 's mental fatigue , too . I do n't think as clearly and I 'm more emotional . " Self-care is incredibly important , " Peterson summed up . " It 's easy to lose yourself when caring for a young child . My husband is supportive and minds Zachary while I exercise or relax . That helps me keep my energy up . " Julie Evans laughs when she tells her secret fatigue weapon : " Starbucks every morning ! " Evans works as a freelance writer after her boys go to bed . " Fatigue is not something I can separate out from MS or being a single mom who works at home with odd hours . " Photograph Aliyah Rivera helps her father . Rod , make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She teaches first grade . And her now twoyear-old , Jonathon , is extremely active . " I like to do things with him , but I try not to go overboard , " she said . Neeper jobshared the last school year , working Mondays , Wednesdays , and every other Friday . " As long as you are loving , that 's all preschoolers need , " she said , resisting " supermom " peer pressure . " Kids do n't need to be in every playgroup or go to every wonderful place . " Anti-exhaustion measures " Parents who manage their own fatigue do better , " Crawford said . These strategies can help forestall a meltdown : * Manage your time . " Alternate more physically active days with less active ones . Combine errands so you do n't go to the store more often than necessary . Plan a quiet day at home for less tiring activities . If you go to a mall , take the stroller . It helps with balance and gives you a place to stow things rather than carry them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph The Riveras : Mary , Rod , Angelina , and Aliyah. // * Plan ahead . " Look at the whole day and move things around ahead of time to head off problems . One mother with severe fatigue really wanted to walk up to the corner to meet her child 's school bus each afternoon . She was able to do it by resting after lunch and then cooling down by icing herself before time to meet the bus . " * Problem-solve by engaging your children . " Do n't be afraid to give your toddlers tasks . Chances are they will love it . A mother of several kids was running herself ragged doing laundry until she figured out a system . She gave each child a different colored plastic basket , then taught them to sort and cart their own laundry to their rooms-and put it away ! " The art of being consistent " Regularity is extremely reassuring to preschool kids-the same mealtimes and bedtime , the same people around , " Crawford advised . Peterson finds that consistency helps both Zachary and herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to get carried . " I have to stick to what I said . I 'll tell him , ' We can walk up together and hold hands ' Or I 'll walk up the stairs and just leave him at the bottom . " I think there are long-term consequences if I give in when I 'm tired and carry him when he does n't need to be carried . I notice when I go through a few days of fatigue , he 'll push , testing the limits . Of course , that 's a three-year-old 's job : to test the limits . But if I give in , he 'll push the limits even more because I 'm not being consistent and he senses the limits are n't real . " Pain management " I 'm not an effective mom if I ca n't control my pain , " Evans said . During both pregnancies , she stopped taking her disease-modifying drug and a seizure medication that is sometimes used to treat MS pain . After each birth , her pain symptoms became unbearable . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a smart trade-off . Now her symptoms are better controlled , although occasionally when Will is romping , he 'll accidentally bump into her left ear , which gives her a sharp pain . " Taking a little pain medication throughout the day may be better than taking fewer larger doses , " Crawford suggested . " You may need to talk with your doctor about changing your medication schedule so your pain is under good control during the high-stress times , like supper and bath time . " Evans'major issue is her diseasemodifying drug . The medication gives her a head-crushing headache and nausea . " The next morning the kids come bouncing in , and I say ' Mommy does n't feel well . ' Sometimes I growl at them and I 'd like to take it back , " she reported . Moreover , her five-year-old wants to see her give herself a shot . " I 've chosen to shoo him away , " she said . " If the older one comes in , the younger one will want in , too . My two-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Most parents who self-inject do it when little ones are n't around or at night after they 're asleep , " Crawford said . " It 's not an issue of secrecy . It 's distracting to have kids around . " Some toy doctor sets might relieve this a little . The children will give injections to everything in the house until the idea is exhausted . Photograph Julie , Will , and Sam spending quality time together . // Keeping it all in perspective " I work out . I lift weights three days a week , " said Radames ( Rod ) Rivera , father of five-year-old Angelina and three-yearold Aliyah . " I 've got to take care of myself . Working out helps a lot as a stress reliever . " As a customer service supervisor for an airline , Rivera is on his feet all day . " When I come home , I 'm pooped and the girls want to play . " Rivera was diagnosed with MS well before the birth of his children . " I was scared of having children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick them up . But I found I could do everything they need me to do . " And he does a great deal-bathing the girls , putting them to bed , doing laundry , and driving Angelina to her preschool three days a week . His wife , Mary , works nights and weekends as a nurse . He works from noon to 8:30 P.M. , Sunday through Thursday . " Our schedules are hard , " he said . " Being with the girls is great , but my wife and I are just ' hi-bye ' these days . " Still , Rivera looks ahead with a smile : " The girls are n't going to be three and five all that long . " The fear factor Some parents worry that their children will be frightened by MS . And they could be . " If kids see a parent fall , " Crawford said , " it scares them . Adults are n't supposed to fall down . After a fall , a child may stay close and monitor the parent 's movements . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very empathie , " she explained . " I know a four-year-old who asks his mother if she needs to sit down and rest . He 's very aware his mother has difficulty walking . His concern does n't necessarily mean that he 's anxious or overburdened . Raising compassionate kids is not a bad thing ! " Crawford says it 's important not to assume that problems like bedwetting , nightmares , or temper tantrums are attributable to MS . These are common developmental concerns . " Some people tend to think that every behavior problem is related to MS . Usually it 's not , " she said . How much should a parent tell ? Parents often wonder how much to tell their preschoolers about MS . Mary Elizabeth McNary , the mother of five-year-old twins , believes in full disclosure . She was diagnosed with MS a decade before Aidan and Aisling were born , so they 've always known that " Mommy ca n't run and Mommy ca n't drive . " And because McNary is an MS vocational rehab counselor , her children may hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very matter-of-fact about it from day one . So now , when we go to the park , they 'll tell other children , ' My mom has MS , so she ca n't run . Her brain does n't get the message to her feet . It 's not her fault . ' " A preschooler 's acceptance of difference can be the foundation for a better understanding of people in general . " They see difference as neither good nor bad , just different , " said Kim Koch , manager of National MS Society family programs , who edits Keep S'myelin , the Society 's newsletter just for children . Last year , Julie Evans took Will to his chapter 's MS Walk . " We told him it was to raise money for people who have the same disease as me . I was surprised , but it did n't spark any questions . He saw people with canes and wheelchairs and it did n't scare him . The exposure was good for him . I 'm going to take him again this year .
