<p> A potential political revolution is brewing in counties around Denver . <p> While attention has been focused on the candidates jostling for the state 's open U.S. Senate seat , virtually unnoticed is the large number of county commission races that wo n't include incumbents , a phenomenon courtesy of term limits . <p> More than half the county commissioners in five Denver-area counties will be ' termed out ' in November - nine of 17 in Adams , Arapahoe , Boulder , Douglas and Jefferson . <p> Statewide , 37 of 219 commissioners will be termed out next fall . Those open seats in combination with normal turnover - about a third of incumbents typically lose - could make for wholesale political change , said Larry Kallenberger , executive director of Colorado Counties . <p> ' Theoretically , it could be a new day in most counties in Colorado the day after the election , ' Kallenberger said . <p> As the April 13 party caucuses approach , the bounty of open seats has created distinct political dynamics in each county : It has brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates who see an opening in Jefferson , and Republicans who previously had been too polite to challenge their incumbent brethren in Douglas . <p> And while county commissioners sometimes are viewed as the ' farm team ' for higher office , they wield significant money and local power . <p> ' It 's less high-profile than being in the legislature , but it 's probably more high-power , ' said Eric Sondermann , a Denver-based political analyst . ' People regard that office as not that high on the political food chain , but there are significant responsibilities there . ' <p> For instance , commissioners direct land use , maintain bridges and roads , and decide how much tax money will be spent on a variety of services , including law enforcement . <p> In the five Denver-area counties , commissioners have authority over $ 566 million of general-fund tax dollars . <p> ' These decisions are so important , ' said Patricia Holloway , a Jeffco commissioner who can not seek re-election . ' It 's a place where you can really make a difference . ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's larger counties make $ 63,203 a year , while members of the Colorado General Assembly make $ 30,000 , plus some expenses . <p> But in Jefferson County , candidates for the two open commission seats on the three-member board will tell you it 's not about money . It 's about restoring dignity and productivity to a board they say is an embarrassment for its infighting . <p> ' They 've lost leadership in the region because of the acrimony among them , ' said Wally Pulliam , a Republican seeking one of the seats . Though opponents paint him as closely aligned with the current administration , Pulliam said he would not be ' part of their cabal ' if he is elected . <p> His opponent , former state Sen. Jim Congrove , also a Republican , was harsher still , saying he has been profoundly disturbed by how county employees have been treated , a tone he said has been set by the commission . <p> ' There are a lot of personnel problems , ' Congrove said , lamenting what he said is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to a former county accountant who has informed the county of her intent to sue for wrongful termination . <p> Voters in this staunchly Republican county are so angry , said John Burdan , president of the Jeffco Republican Men 's Club , that they might even elect a Democrat . <p> ' The Democrats , ' Burdan said ruefully , ' are salivating . ' <p> While campaigning for change is the agenda for some in Boulder County , it is change of a different sort . Libertarians see the two open seats on the three-member commission as a chance to install one of their own in the county , which is heavy with Democratic and unaffiliated voters . <p> ' Not in too many places do Libertarians get the upper hand , ' said Bo Shaffer , chairman of the county 's Libertarian Party . <p> They have a candidate for each seat but face significant opposition from Democrats . Shaffer said he is targeting the growing number of voters who call themselves unaffiliated . <p> ' These are the people we need to reach , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Term limits , approved by voters in 1990 and extended to many local officials in 1994 , are having a particularly strong impact in the Denver metro area . That 's because voters in 28 counties , largely in other parts of the state , chose to rescind or modify such limits , Kallenberger said . <p> This is the second year that term limits have applied to local officials , but they are taking a particularly heavy toll because it is a year in which two seats are up for election on what are typically three-member commissions . <p> While term limits generally have broadened the variety of candidates coming out , a somewhat insular race is shaping up in Douglas County . Republicans dominate so thoroughly in Douglas that five of them thus far make up the field for a seat held since 1989 by a Republican who is now termed out . <p> Douglas County Clerk Carole Murray said she believes it is the first open county commission seat - one that had no elected or appointed incumbent - since 1988 . The interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels comfortable jumping in , ' Murray said . ' They 're not concerned about possibly offending someone who owns the seat . ' <p> The dominance of the Republican Party in Douglas means the caucus and county assembly processes will play a significant part in choosing the next commissioner . <p> In the caucuses , party members select delegates who attend subsequent county assemblies . There , delegates vote on the commissioners who advance to the primary election in August . <p> Candidates have to get at least 30 percent of the vote , but there is a way to petition onto the ballot with a smaller percentage . It 's likely , party experts said , that two or three of the five will make it to the primary . <p> It 's a relatively informal process , full of ' speechifying and balloons , ' said Mark Scheffel , chair of the Douglas County Republican Party . <p> Not everyone likes the caucus process , which puts a lot of power in relatively few hands and favors those who have been involved for years , said Jack McCormick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some laud the process as the essence of grassroots political activism , others say the clubby , relatively sparsely attended caucuses limit the range of candidate choices brought about by open seats . <p> The issue of political control is a more open question in Adams County , where commission candidate Alice Nichol said Democrats are trying to solidify the edge they only recently had regained . <p> Nichol , a Democrat , state senator and lifelong Adams County resident , faces three Republicans for a seat that had been held by a Republican . Two Democrats thus far have come out for the other open seat . The remaining commissioner is a Democrat . <p> Voter registration numbers in Adams show Democrats and unaffiliated voters each have 35 percent , but Republicans are not far behind with 30 percent of registered voters . <p> That , in combination with a presidential election year and open seats , has prompted significant interest in the caucuses , said Pat Moore , Adams County Democratic Party chair . <p> ' We 're still Democratic , but not by much , ' Nichol said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I hope to do that . ' <p> The balance of power is n't a factor in Arapahoe , where the commission is largely Republican . But the open seats have re-energized local politics , said Jon Gallo , editor of the Arapahoe County Republican Men 's Club newsletter . <p> It 's a phenomenon that has flown under the radar as politicos have focused on the presidential race and the jockeying for the Colorado U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Ben Nighthorse Campbell , Gallo said . <p> The debates leading up to the caucuses have been polite but pointed . There is also a distinct post-Tracy Baker flavor to the talk , said Richard Schroeder , president of the Arapahoe County Republican Men 's Club . <p> Baker , the clerk and recorder ousted by voters , has prompted more discussion of ethics and official conduct , Schroeder said . <p> ' It 's an issue that rides below the surface , ' Schroeder said . <p> And given the low profile of commission races , which are not big- money events , that 's likely to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently are n't aware of the scope of power and range of decisions made by commissioners . Commission seats are n't what one might consider the glamour jobs of politics . <p> " A lot of times people overlook the commissioner races because they 're not visible - they 're not buying TV and radio , " Atkinson said . " They 're awfully important - and awfully entertaining . "
