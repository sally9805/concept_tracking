In the sporting world , Reggie Jackson might be " Mister October , - but in the realm of entertainment , that title should go to Mr. B. With such classic tales as Something Wicked This Way Comes , Dark Carnival , The Halloween Tree , and of course The October Country , Ray Bradbury has shaped our dreams and nightmares for more than fifty years . His latest novel , From the Dust Returned , takes us into the attics of the macabre Elliott family . His new story takes us out onto the links with very unsettling results . <p> THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN and in a few swift minutes it dipped below the horizon and the shadows came out from under all the trees , and one by one the golf-range practicers scabbarded their clubs , packed their golf balls , shucked their dark glasses and headed for the parking lot . When the sun was completely gone the cars had gone with it ; the lot was empty , the driving range abandoned , or almost abandoned . Glenn Foray was checking some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tee-off point when he heard it . Once , twice , three times . Whack , whack , whack . Good solid blows of a club against three balls . That was not ordinary . Glenn Foray glanced up . To the far left of the range , situated on the tee with an old-fashioned niblick driver in hand , and his tartan cap pulled low on his brow , stood a now familiar figure , a man who had been in and out of the range for some years but now was bending to tee three more balls as if it must be done quickly . Then he straightened up , adjusted his club , and whack , whack , whack again . Glenn Foray regarded the missing sun , the empty car lot with but two cars , his own , and this lone golfer 's . He rose from his desk and went to stand in the doorway , watching . The routine was repeated . One , two , three . Whack , whack , whack . The golfer was starting a third attack when Glenn Foray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice and drove the golf balls , one after another , far out on the green fairway . Foray watched them sail , then said , " Evening , Mr. Gingrich . Nice go . " " Was it ? Did it ? " Gingrich said , having ignored where the balls landed . " Well , yes . Sure . Evening . Quitting time ? " Foray waited as Gingrich placed three more . There was something in the man 's face and the way his arm stretched and his knuckles clutched the missiles that stopped his agreement . " Quitting time ? " he said . " Not yet . " Gingrich stared at the golf balls on the new tees . " Glad to hear that . Just a few more ? " " Hell , " said Foray quietly . " Take your time . I got some figures to add . Be here another half hour . " " Good news . " Gingrich had a nice backswing and follow-through . One , two , three . " I know it 's not your job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three more buckets ? " " No sweat . " Foray turned , went , and brought back three more fully loaded golf ball carriers . " Here you go . " " Thanks , " said Gingrich , still not looking up , shoving more tees in the turf . His cheeks were flushed , his eyes hot with a kind of sporting frenzy as if he were playing against himself and not happy . His fingers , thrust down , seemed flushed with color , too . " Very kind of you , " he almost shouted . Foray waited for three more solid cracks and three high-flying white balls before he backed off . From the office doorway he watched Gingrich attack with an even more concerted energy , blow after blow , almost as if he were striking , what ? a bad day at the office ? a fellow golfer ? a dishonest friend ? Foray snorted at his own one , two , three hard-driven thoughts . At his computer he tried to recall what he had been summing up , but still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night lamps switched on , flooding the empty fairway with light . It was late on a Sunday , the one night when the range closed early , and still the man with the angry eyes and the crimson face slammed the balls high and before they fell thrust more tees in place to empty the buckets . By the time they were empty , Foray had carried two more full loads out , quietly , and set them down . Gingrich , seeing this as an act of friendship , nodded his thanks and continued his robot performance . One , two , three , one , two , three , one  --  Foray did not move for a long while . At last he said , " Everything okay , Mr. Gingrich ? " Gingrich hit another three and then at last looked up . " What could not be okay ? " he said . And there were tears in his eyes . Foray swallowed and could find no words until at last he said , looking at the crimsoned cheeks of the man and the fiery eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Okay . " Gingrich nodded abruptly and lowered his head . A few clear drops of water fell from his eyes . Foray said , " I just figured . It 'll take me another forty minutes , an hour , to finish up . You can close the joint , with me . " " Fine . Damned fine , " Gingrich said . And clipped three clumps of grass and turf . Foray felt the blows as if the club hit his midriff , they were that intense . The effect was like a film speeded up . No sooner were the balls up than they were gone . The air seemed full of white birds sailing in the night trees . Foray kept rising to go to the doorway and stare out , taking the impacts , stunned with the progress of this lonely game . " None of my business , " he murmured , but still turned to his computer . He called up the index of frequent players : Galen , Gallager , Games .... Here it was . Whack , whack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2344 Patricia Avenue , L.A. 90064 . Mr. and Mrs. ( Eleanor ) Golf practice lessons early on . Repeat a few months ago . Steady customer . " All the notes he had typed himself . He looked out at the range and watched the man in his almost lunatic frenzy and wondered , do I bring more buckets , yes , no ? He brought more buckets . This time , Gingrich did not even glance up or nod . Foray , like a man walking underwater , for reasons he did not quite understand , moved out toward his open top roadster , listened to the constant knock , saw more white objects fly in a sky where the moon was slowly rising , and drove away . What do I say ? he thought . Mrs. Gingrich , come get your husband ? When he had parked in front of 2344 Patricia Avenue he looked in at the large Georgian house where some , not all , of the lights were lit . He saw shadows moving to one side in the windows . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell with this , " he thought . " What 's wrong with you ? Fool ! " He stepped on the gas and started to glide away but in his head he heard the chopping sounds , one , two , three , and stopped and coasted the car back near the curb . He waited a long while , chewing his lower lip , cursing , and at last got out , stood swaying , and moved up the walk . He stood before the front door for another long minute listening to the soft voices inside and the music playing low , and at last touched the doorbell with almost as much force as the lone player thrusting in the tees . Silence . He rang again . More silence . One , two , three . Three thrusts . Three bell sounds , each louder . He stopped and waited . At long last the door opened and a woman 's face appeared . Her hair was tousled and her face was moist with a faint perspiration . Her eyes adjusted to his face and she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foray said . " Yes ? " she seemed confused , and glanced swiftly over her shoulder . In a far doorway , Foray saw the shadow of a man , or what seemed the shadow of a man . " Yes ? " she said again , quickly . He swayed in place . One , two , three . Knock , knock , knock . Crack , crack , crack . No one else heard the sounds . He wet his lips , closed his eyes , opened them and for some reason said : " I 'm Gingrich , " he said . " What ? " she said , even more confused . " Gingrich , William , " he said , louder . " You 're not my husband ! " she said . " Yes , " he said . " I am . " And hauled off and struck her in the mouth with his fist . As she held her lips with both hands , falling back , he cried , " And if you come out , you 'll get the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . Foray turned and walked back underwater to the car and drove away . At the driving range Gingrich was still hitting the white objects , striking the blows , mechanically , downswing , strike , downswing , crack , downswing , bang ! Foray appeared nearby with a golf bag full of clubs . Gingrich paused and looked at the bag . " What ? " he said . Foray said , " How about one last round ? " Gingrich looked at the open fairway to his left . A wire screen door opened there to the first tee . " This late at night ? " he said . " It 's never too late , " said Foray . " I 'll carry the clubs . " " I 'll be damned , " said Gingrich . " Not if I can help it , " said Foray . Gingrich said , " We wo n't be able to see . " " We will . " Foray nodded at the sky . A full moon was rising to light the long spreads and the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wind rustled in the oak trees . " I 'll be damned , " whispered Gingrich . He let himself be led out the wire screen door to the first tee . " You first , " said Foray , and placed the ball and tee for him . Gingrich watched , almost frozen . When Foray stood back , Gingrich took steady aim , raised his club and brought it down like a blow of summer lightning . Bam ! He watched the ball fly like a lovely white bird up toward the moon and down toward the fairway green . " Son of a bitch ! " he cried . " Oh , oh , " he cried again . " Son of a bitch ! " " Fore ! " Foray shouted , though there was no one out there on the course to harm . Or maybe there was someone way out there , a shadow . " Fore ! " he said . " Lousy life , true , but awesome web site . Go on in. "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
