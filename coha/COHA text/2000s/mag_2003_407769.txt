These three help to keep great places unspoiled-in Africa , Italy , and Thailand . // In January of this year , at National Geographic 's Washington , DC , headquarters , Queen Noor of Jordan presented the first World Legacy Awards in sustainable tourism-a joint program of TRAVELER and Conservation International . Each winner in the three categories below works to protect the natural and cultural quality of the places we visit , supports local communities , and gives us lasting travel memories . Nature Travel Southern Africa-Wilderness Safaris To me , there is no more uplifting , inspirational , or educational form of travel than a safari , " Colin Bell , founder of Wilderness Safaris , tells me . So I 'm learning in northern Namibia at the company 's Skeleton Coast Camp , a 600,000-acre reserve , one of 37 eco-friendly Wilderness Safari camps in seven African countries . The experience is more than just touring Earth 's oldest desert ( 55 million years ) with sand dunes that vibrate and hum under the chilly Atlantic winds . It 's more than tracking springbok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garnet , agate , and diamond ; more even than visiting the nomadic Himba to witness their centuries-old way of life . It 's complete immersion in the large , fantastic world of the desert . When I ask if any industrial use threatens this land , our amiable guide , Douw Steyn , says , " Yes . It 's widely used in the tourist trade . " He shows us a gravel plain lacerated by the truck tires of joyriding tourists , saying the tracks will take a century or more to disappear . Southern Africa-based Wilderness Safaris , by contrast , has built its reputation on minimizing tourism damage and maximizing its benefits to both people and nature . At the Mombo Camp in Botswana 's Okavango Delta , for instance , my gin and tonic came with a slide show on the Wilderness-backed rhino reintroduction program here . Poachers eradicated rhinos here in the early 1980s , but now 21 white rhinos nibble about . On a walking safari at Jao Camp , also in the Okavango , local guide Frank Mashebe thrilled guests by unlocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air-conditioning system , for instance ) . Wilderness Safaris won its award partly because it hires , trains , and promotes talented locals like Mashebe . At Botswana 's Savuti Camp , another skilled guide , Benson Siyawareva , tracked down the rare African wild dog , or " painted wolf . " Only 5,000 or so still roam , but he finds a pack of 16-the gift of conservation . " Our conservation ethic and community-based tourism model have resulted in threatened land becoming protected , " Bell tells me . " And our Children in the Wilderness project , which has given week-long safaris to a thousand underprivileged African children , should help create the next generation of African conservationists.

Heritage Tourism Italy-ATG Oxford ( U.K. ) The path winds through forests of beech and chestnut . Monks , shepherds , mercenaries , and saffron traders have passed this way for millennia . The path turns and suddenly , like great theater , the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing as a mirage in these isolated woods . The group gives a collective sigh of delight , wonder , and a pinch of relief . It 's been a challenging walk . " Welcome to Sant'Eutizio , pilgrims , " says Daniel Adamson , the group leader . This is just one of many eureka moments we 've enjoyed over the last week . We have opened the doors of a deserted church to find Renaissance frescoes glowing within , and chatted with the art historian as she restores one . We 've savored lavish picnic banquets that appear like conjuring tricks beneath ancient porticoes or in shady olive groves . We have knelt in mountain meadows and learned to tell female orchids from male orchids . And so we have come to know a stretch of remote central Italy with vividness and intimacy few visitors experience . All this thanks to ATG Oxford , a company that organizes walking tours in little-known parts of Europe , the Middle East , and beyond . Founded in Oxford , England , in 1979 , ATG ( Alternative Travel Group ) leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hunting trails , seeking authentic experiences that package tourists can only dream of . ATG helps to preserve the landscapes through which its customers travel . It limits group size to minimize environmental impact . It maintains footpaths and recycles everything . Its ATG Charitable Trust funds cultural and environmental projects along the company 's many routes . Several highlights of our journey , including the fifth-century path to Sant'Eutizio and the Renaissance frescoes in the abandoned church of Gavelli , were rescued by the ATG Trust . Such initiatives to safeguard lesser known treasures for visitors and local people alike earned ATG Oxford its World Legacy Award . In the end , the company 's initiatives are about people . By specializing in destinations that tour buses and trains do n't reach , ATG spends 65 percent of its revenue in small communities otherwise deprived of tourist dollars and sometimes threatened with extinction . As a result , the villagers in each hilltop town we visit give us warm welcomes and greet Adamson like a long-lost son .

Gradually we come to know the people as well as their land. - Tom Mueller * See www.atg-oxford.co.uk ; from U.S. , phone 011-44-1865-315678 . Destination Stewardship Thailand-Koh Yao Noi , REST Cruising Phang-nga Bay with a sun-browned Thai fisherman , Dusit Buttree , it 's hard to believe that we 're just an hour from some of the biggest mass-tourism destinations in Thailand . Unlike nearby Phuket , with its souvenir vendors and go-go bars , Buttree 's home island of Koh Yao Noi retains its fishing villages and mangrove forests . Gibbons still haunt the outlying islands here , sea eagles soar in the skies , and the seas yield enough fish to give Buttree 's family a stable income . It nearly was n't this way . Just over a decade ago , trawlers from the mainland were illegally overfishing these waters , and mass tourism from Phuket threatened to disrupt the cultural traditions of Koh Yao Noi 's 4,500 mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers sought the help of the Responsible Ecological Social Tours project ( REST ) , a Bangkok-based group that works with locals to develop community-based tourism , promote conservation , and develop a sustainable economy . REST encouraged the Koh Yao Noi villagers to organize tour programs , host visitors in their homes , and share with them their traditional way of life . Buttree is n't just taking me on a tour of Phang-nga Bay , after all-he 's also fishing for his day 's keep . He can host tourists on his own terms , while I can experience a slice of Thai life in a way that no beach resort could provide . What 's more , the REST arrangement has instilled Koh Yao Noi villagers with a sense of confidence and grassroots power that benefits the community long after tourists have gone home . " We welcome our visitors like cousins , " Buttree tells me as he hauls in his nets . " When they go home , our village has a face to the rest of Thailand and the rest of the world . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and develop our island for their own interests . " Thanks to its empowered community , Koh Yao Noi should be able to offer visitors an authentic Thai travel experience for years to come . That night , we return to Buttree 's stilted wood house , where his wife , Busaba , prepares a sumptuous dinner of blue crab , red snapper , and lobsterlike mantis shrimp . As I dig in , I tell Buttree this is the freshest seafood I 've ever eaten . I should know : I watched him catch it . - Rolf Potts * REST runs tours ( www.ecotour.in.th ) ; or take one of the daily boats to Koh Yao Noi from the Bang Rong Pier on Phuket 's northeast coast .
