Section : Healthy Pet Nonsurgical hope for this painful condition <p> Hip dysplasia is a crippling condition most frequently seen in large dogs , although it can also occur in small dogs and even cats . The hip joint is a ball-and-socket type and in a healthy animal , the ball or head fits tightly into the socket , resulting in smooth and pain-free movement . <p> With hip dysplasia , the joint is loose , causing unstable and often painful movement . Over time , the instability results in debilitating arthritis . The cause of hip dysplasia is complex , although we do know that genetics plays a big role . For instance , certain large breeds such as German shepherds are more prone to the disease . <p> Recently , studies have implicated nutrition and rapid growth in a puppy as factors in the development of the disease . These results have led to the development of special diets for the rapid growth stage of large breed dogs . Ask your vet to recommend one . What to Look For <p> Do n't assume that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has hip dysplasia . Only your veterinarian can make the proper diagnosis . The first signs of hip dysplasia may appear as early as 4 months of age and as late as 10 years . A dysplastic dog may have stiffness upon rising . The stiffness usually gets a bit better after moving around . He may hold a hind leg up or drag it . Bunny hopping while running and waddling while walking are common . Many dogs are reluctant to climb stairs or play Frisbee , because these activities apply a lot of force to the joint . <p> Your veterinarian can make a preliminary diagnosis based on a physical examination . For a more definitive diagnosis , especially on a younger animal , x-rays are used . These require anesthesia , since it can be uncomfortable to put an affected dog in the position necessary to make the diagnosis . Help Your Dog Have a Normal Life <p> The treatment for hip dysplasia is aimed at relieving discomfort and pain and preventing the progression of arthritis . Until recently , surgery had been touted as the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture at the Tufts Animal Expo 2000 in Boston , veterinary orthopedists recommended effective medical therapies . Although there is no cure for hip dysplasia , a combination of the treatments outlined below can reduce your dog 's pain and allow him to lead a near-normal life . <p> <p> Weight loss . Weight loss is essential ! Extra weight means more pressure on the hip joint at every step and , therefore , more pain . Weight loss alone can result in pain relief in a majority of animals . Try weight-reducing diets and carrots or string beans as low-calorie nutritious treats . Your vet can help you design a program . <p> <p> Exercise and physical therapy . A controlled exercise program not only helps to burn calories but also strengthens the muscles surrounding the hip joint to reduce instability and increase the range of motion in arthritic joints . <p> <p> Disease-modifying agents . Available in both oral and injectable forms , these agents enhance joint health by providing the necessary precursors to maintain and repair the cartilage components of the joint . The Oral products are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various products differ in content and effectiveness . Check with your veterinarian before using one . The injectable form polysulfated glycosaminoglycan ( Adequan ) is approved for use in dogs and horses . It is injected into a muscle twice weekly . Studies suggest that it may also reduce lameness and pain and increase range of motion in dogs with hip dysplasia . None of the disease-modifying agents have any serious side effects . <p> <p> Anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications . The most commonly used treatments in dogs are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , because they reduce joint pain and inflammation . Buffered aspirin , because of its low cost and availability , has been the most frequently prescribed drug . Its tendency to cause stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal problems has led veterinarians to lean toward other NSAIDs . But because of the possibility of side effects with all of the NSAIDs , it is recommended that they be used only short term for acute pain . These drugs are not approved for use in cats ; before giving your cat an aspirin , get advice from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried all of the above , and your dog is still in severe pain , surgery may be necessary . The type of surgery recommended depends on your dog 's age , severity of arthritis , general health , temperament , and your finances . The common techniques recommended are triple pelvic osteotomies ( which reshape the hip joint ) in young dogs , total hip replacements in older dogs , and as a last resort , removal of the femoral head or ball of the joint , after which the body forms a painless false joint . <p> Get the opinion of your veterinarian and a veterinary orthopedic surgeon if possible . 10 Tips for Exercising with Dysplasia <p> Always check with your veterinarian to decide what 's best for your individual pet before starting any exercise program . Here are some additional tips : Start your dog 's exercise program gradually , and increase it as his painfree movement improves . Cut back ( but do n't stop ! ) if your dog is very stiff after an exercise session . Stick to low-impact exercises , such as walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , or even snow ; this forces the dog to fully raise his legs to decrease stiffness . A gentle game of tug-of-war encourages a dog to work his hind legs . ( Do n't do this if your dog has growled at you or tried to bite you . ) Try to exercise your dog every day . Do n't vary the exercises too much ; this can overload the joints and cause pain . At the beginning , some anti-inflammatory medication may be helpful . Your dog may get comfort from cold packs on the hips immediately after 20 minutes of exercise , warm compresses 10 to 15 minutes twice a day , or a heated bed at other times . Always provide a soft , comfortable bed for your dog . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Love  --  not treats  --  can help your dog avoid this pain . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Gentle water exercise if great for joints . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Even with hip problems , dogs still need activity . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical assistant professor at the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and vice president of Behavioral Medicine and Companion Animal Services at the ASPCA Headquarters in New York City <p>
