Washington , D.C. A fine mist fell from the darkening spring sky as the black limousine turned off of E Street . The armor-plated car weaved through the concrete-and-steel barricades at a speed suggesting urgency . As the limousine turned onto West Executive Drive , it slowed briefly for the heavy black gate to open , and then sped forward . After splashing through several puddles , the limo came to an abrupt stop in front of the ground-floor entrance to the West Wing of the White House . The rear passenger door opened immediately , and Dr. Irene Kennedy stepped from the car . She walked under the long off-white awning that extended from the building to the curb and paused to let her boss catch up . Thomas Stansfield slowly climbed out of the limo and buttoned the jacket of his charcoal gray suit . At seventy-nine years of age Stansfield was an icon in the intelligence community . His career dated all the way back to World War II and the OSS , the precursor to the CIA . Stansfield had been one of Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war fought by a different breed . Stansfield was the last one . Now they were all gone , retired or dead , and it would n't be much longer before he turned over the reins of power at the much-maligned and embattled intelligence agency . The CIA had changed during his tenure . More precisely , the threats had changed , and the CIA was forced to change with them . The old static days of a two-superpower world were long gone , replaced by small regional conflicts and the ever-growing threat of terrorism . As Stansfield closed out his career , this was what bothered him most . The threat of one individual bringing biological , chemical , or nuclear annihilation to America was becoming more and more plausible . Stansfield looked up at the lazy mist that was falling from the early evening sky . A light spray dusted his face , and the silver-haired director of the CIA blinked . Something was bothering him , and he could n't quite put his finger on it . Stansfield gave the darkening sky one last look and then stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where two uniformed Secret Service officers were standing post , and started down the long hall . This was the first floor of the West Wing . The president 's office was located on the floor above , but that was not where they would be meeting . Irene Kennedy sped ahead , while Stansfield followed at his always even pace . Down the hallway , on the right , a U.S. Navy officer stood in his cleanly pressed black uniform with his hands clasped firmly in front of him . " Good evening , Dr. Kennedy . Everything is ready . The generals and the president are waiting for you . " The watch officer of the White House Situation Room gestured to his left . " Thank you , Commander Hicks , " replied Kennedy as she walked past the naval officer . They went down several steps , took a right , and came to a secure door with a camera mounted above it . To the left was a black-and-gold plaque with the words " White House Situation Room : Restricted Access . " The lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . She entered and turned to her left , into the Situation Room 's new conference room . Director Stansfield followed her , and Commander Hicks closed the soundproof door behind them . President Robert Hayes , dressed in a tuxedo , stood at the far end of the room and listened intently to the two men in front of him . The first , General Flood , was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs . Flood was six four and weighed almost two hundred seventy pounds . The second man was General Campbell , a half foot shorter than his superior and one hundred pounds lighter . Campbell was the commander of the U.S. military 's Joint Special Operations Command , or JSOC . Before taking his most recent job , he had proudly commanded the famous 82nd Airborne Division and the 18th Airborne Corps . President Hayes had been in office for only five months , and thus far had a decent working relationship with both the Pentagon and the CIA . Before being elected president , Robert Xavier Hayes had served as both U.S. congressman and senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest office in the land largely because he had a very clean personal life and was seen as someone who could mend the ever-deepening divide between the two parties . The previous administration had been rife with scandal , so much so that the American people had overwhelmingly picked someone whose personal life could pass the rigorous scrutiny of the press . Hayes was happily married and had three children in their thirties , all of whom had managed to stay off the tabloid covers and live relatively normal lives . Kennedy set her briefcase on a chair near the end of the long table and said , " If everyone will be seated , we can get started . " She felt rushed . Things were coming together at a frantic pace . Director Stansfield greeted the two generals and the president . No one was in a talkative mood . The president worked his way around to the opposite end of the table and sat in his high-backed leather chair . All four walls of the room were covered with dark wood except a square section behind the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of it was the circular seal of the president of the United States . With the president at the head of the table , the two generals sat on his right and Director Stansfield on his left . Kennedy handed each of the men identical folders that were sealed with red tape and marked Top Secret . " Please feel free to open the files while I get the rest of the materials ready . " Kennedy pushed some of her shoulder-length brown hair back behind her ear . After several seconds of digging through her briefcase , she found the right disk and inserted it into the A drive of the computer under the podium . About sixty seconds later the director of the CIA 's Counter-terrorism Center was ready to start . A map of the Persian Gulf appeared on the large screen to Kennedy 's right , and she began , " Mr. President , four days ago we inserted one of our people into the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas . Our man was operating on some information he received that Sheik Fara Harut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button , and the screen changed from the map to a grainy black-and-white photograph of a bearded man in a turban . " Fara Harut , shown here in this 1983 photograph , is the religious leader of the militant Islamic group Hezbollah . He has very strong ties to the religious conservatives in Iran . " Kennedy glanced sideways at the president and added , " You may have noted some mention of him in your PDB . " Kennedy was referring to the President 's Daily Brief , an intelligence summary given to him every morning by the CIA . The president nodded . " I recall the name . " Kennedy pressed a button , and a new photo appeared on the screen , this time of a much younger , clean-shaven , and handsome individual . " This is Rafique Aziz . It was taken in the late seventies , when Aziz was obtaining a degree in electrical engineering from American University in Beirut . " The president nodded reluctantly and said , " I am definitely familiar with this individual . " Kennedy nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent development . " The doctor pointed to the screen at the front of the room , and a series of photos played out showing charred buses and grotesque , bloody bodies . " These bombings have all been linked to the fundamentalist Palestinian group Hamas . Hamas has stepped up its attacks recently in an effort to derail the Middle East peace process . Hezbollah and Hamas have done very little to help each other 's causes . " Kennedy looked down the long table and added , " That is , until recently . Aziz and Harut have been looking for a way to continue their fight as things have calmed in Beirut . They found their opportunity after Israel assassinated Hamas leader Yehya Ayyash in 1996 . Hamas turned even more militant , stepping up its efforts to drive Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip . In this most recent period , the Israelis have noted a marked increase in the sophistication of Hamas bombs and tactics . It is our belief that Rafique Aziz is responsible for this . " Kennedy paused and got ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , we have also learned that Saddam Hussein has offered to help fund some of the group 's actions . " President Hayes shook his head slowly and scowled . " It gets worse , " Kennedy continued . " The stipulation that Saddam has put on the money is that it be used to attack the United States domestically . " Kennedy emphasized the last word . The information caused Hayes 's left eyebrow to rise a half inch . " Where did we get this ? " Kennedy looked to Stansfield , and the director of the CIA replied , " The NSA intercepted some communications , and we verified them through several of our foreign contacts . " " That 's just great . " Hayes shook his head . Looking to Kennedy with dread in his eyes , he asked , " What else ? " " Two nights ago our man in Iran informed us of a probable ID on Harut , and earlier this evening he made a positive ID . " The president folded his arms across his chest . " Can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Mr. President , " answered Kennedy confidently . Hayes looked from Kennedy to the map of Iran and then back . " I assume you did n't interrupt my dinner plans just to tell me you may have found this fellow . " " You are correct , Mr. President . We have been waiting for this chance for a long time . If we do n't grab him now , we may never get another chance . " Kennedy stopped to make sure the president understood how serious she was . " General Campbell and I have put together a plan to grab Harut . " Kennedy changed the main screen . A second map of the Persian Gulf appeared , this one with a half dozen new markings on it . Kennedy looked to General Campbell and nodded . Campbell rose from his chair , and with his ramrod posture , he marched to the front of the room . Once firmly in position behind the podium , he started . " Mr. President , Harut , like Saddam , never stays in the same place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the first time in over a decade that we have been able to track his whereabouts for more than a day and be in a position to do something about it . " Campbell gestured to the map . " We have two helicopters from the First Special Operations Wing that have left Saudi Arabia and are in the process of hooking up with the Independence , which is on patrol in the Persian Gulf . " The general tapped the spot on the map that marked the location of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . " And over here " the general moved his finger across the Persian Gulf to a spot just off the Iranian coast that was marked by a blue cigar-shaped object " we have the USS Honolulu . As I 'm sure you have already noted , she is no longer in international waters . Right now she is about two miles offshore and waiting for the orders to off-load her cargo . " While Campbell continued his briefing , President Hayes felt as if he were having an out-of-body experience . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea of ordering U.S. troops into battle had no appeal , no mystique , no glory , and surely no satisfaction . People would die tonight because of the orders he gave . The enemy 's men for sure and possibly some of his own . President Hayes listened to the general intently and tried to be objective . Hayes was a student of history and knew that to never use force was foolish . If he did not act tonight , it might someday cost the lives of Americans . Terrorism had to be confronted . He could not pass on this decision . Persian Gulf , 3:16 A.M. ( local time ) In the Iranian seaside city of Bandar Abbas an elderly man shuffled down a dusty street in his dirty white djellaba , a simple robelike garment that flowed from his shoulders to his ankles . A brown turban covered his head and face ; a pair of worn leather sandals , his feet . The wind blew in off the Persian Gulf , and the night sky was filled with thick clouds . The decrepit old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he went . Like so many things in life , appearances could be deceiving . Underneath the ragged turban and djellaba was one hundred ninety pounds of solid , lean muscle . Mitch Rapp , a thirty-one-year-old American , had n't showered in a week . His deeply bronzed skin was covered with a film of dirt , and his black hair and beard were spotted with streaks of gray dye that made him look twice his age . During the late mornings and early afternoons , the American had slept in a tiny apartment . By afternoon and evening he roamed the streets with a brown canvas bag collecting discarded pop cans and bottles . While he played the role of street bum , he kept his posture slouched and his demeanor timid . But his eyes and mind were alert . He scanned doorways and windows and listened to conversations waiting for a clue . Two days earlier he had discovered the telltale sign he had been looking for . Rapp was searching for a man , a man he wanted to kill . His pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dirtiest cities in the Middle East , North Africa , and Europe . In the process Rapp had himself been shot , stabbed , and hunted , and every step of the way his quarry had managed to stay just out of his reach . Six months earlier , on a rainy Paris night , Rapp had had his chance and blown it . A moment of hesitation , of stupid indecision , had allowed Rafique Aziz to escape by the narrowest of margins . Never again , Rapp had sworn a thousand times . Next time he would pull the trigger innocent bystander in the way or not . Tonight , Rapp was determined to pick up the trail again . Nearing the house he had discovered two days earlier , Rapp scanned the rooftops and windows for signs of sentries he might have missed on his previous visits . The smell of the salty air mixing with the open sewage heightened his instincts . He was on enemy ground , walking straight into the lion 's den . The streets he walked belonged to Hezbollah , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern politics . The terrorist group had killed thousands in their jihad their holy war . This was their stronghold in the dirty seaside city of Bandar Abbas . Rapp had learned early in his profession that home was where his enemies were most vulnerable , where they were most likely to feel comfortable and let down their guard . Tonight he would come into their home unannounced and uninvited . Rapp adjusted his turban to conceal everything but his eyes . Then , he turned the corner and continued the shuffle of a man more than twice his age . Several doors down a man sat on a folding chair with an AK-47 resting on his lap . Rapp mumbled to himself in Farsi , intentionally trying to alert the bodyguard to his presence . The bodyguard heard his approaching footsteps and aimed his gun in the direction of the noise . The babbling tramp appeared from the shadows , and the bodyguard relaxed , dropping his weapon back onto his lap . It was his crazy late-night visitor , just another worthless vagrant . As Rapp approached the bodyguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiling , he flashed a set of fake rotten teeth and greeted the armed sentry as he shuffled past . The large man nodded and then leaned back in his chair , resting his head against the wall of the house . Rapp continued down the street , his alert eyes taking inventory of everything on the block . He noted every window and every doorway . He looked beyond the doorframes and the curtains , into the shadows . If this was a trap , that was where they would be waiting . Rapp turned onto an even narrower street . Sixty feet down , the American ducked into an alley that had been built long before cars were envisioned . The tunnel-like passage was four feet wide and enclosed in darkness . Slowing his pace , Rapp stopped in the second alcove on his left and closed his eyes . He set his canvas bag of bottles and cans down and listened intently while squeezing his eyelids tighter , trying to speed up the process of adjusting to the near total darkness . White House Situation Room General Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room with Kennedy . For the last twenty-four hours they had worked almost nonstop to get everything in place , and now they looked on somewhat helplessly as the president analyzed the pros and cons of the mission . After a minute of silence President Hayes looked at Director Stansfield and asked , " Who is this man we have on the ground ? " Director Stansfield closed his mission summary and placed it on the table . " He is one of our best . Fluent in three languages , not counting English , and he understands another half dozen dialects well enough to get by . " " Is he American ? " " Yes . " President Hayes nodded slowly , and then asked the million dollar question . " Instead of exposing ourselves by trying to grab Harut ... " The president paused and formulated the most tactful way to say what he was thinking . " Why do n't we have your man " The president looked to Kennedy . " What is his name ? " " His code name is Iron Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man ... eliminate Harut ? " President Hayes looked cautiously around the room , nervously aware that what he had just suggested was against the law . " We have looked at that as an option , Mr. President , but there is another issue we have n't discussed . " Kennedy looked to her boss . Stansfield sat leaning back in his chair with one leg crossed over the other . He removed his left hand from his chin and said , " We have just recently come into some information , " Stansfield stated evenly , " that is directly related to this operation . Yesterday I received a call from one of my counterparts abroad . They informed me that Hamas is targeting Washington for a terrorist attack . When and where is not certain , but we have a corroborating source that can confirm this intelligence . " Hayes shook his head and uttered a curse under his breath . " Where did you get this information ? " " Our Israeli friends brought it to my attention several weeks ago , and it was corroborated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hayes made a rolling motion with his index finger . " The Israelis picked up a Hamas commander during one of their sweeps through the West Bank about a month ago . While they were interrogating him , he made several references to an attack that was being planned here in Washington . The Israelis could n't get anything more out of the commander on this issue , except that the man behind the operation is none other than Rafique Aziz . " President Hayes swiveled in his chair and looked up at the smaller screen that vividly showed the carnage left from one of Aziz 's bus bombings in Israel . The mere thought of the same thing happening in Washington , D.C. , caused the president 's blood to boil . " This dovetails , " continued Stansfield , " with the NSA 's report that Saddam has offered to bankroll any terrorist attack that is carried out in the United States . " President Hayes looked at the director of the CIA and rose out of his chair . He reminded himself to stay calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was time to start dealing with him in a more ruthless manner . With sarcasm dripping from his voice , the president said , " This is just wonderful . " All Hayes could think about was the lunatic terrorism of the Middle East playing itself out in the streets of America . He knew there was no way he could allow it to happen , not if he could take the battle to them first . Irene Kennedy half listened to the conversation between the two generals , her boss , and the president . At the moment , she was more concerned with Mitch Rapp . Rapp was her recruit , and she had grown very fond of him . There was nothing sexual about the connection ; it was more in the nature of a bond between two people who had been through the wringer together . Kennedy had spent more than half of her youth bouncing around the Middle East as her father was moved from one embassy to another . As a State Department brat she saw nothing unusual in this , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact Kennedy had loved growing up in the Middle East , but unfortunately all of those fond memories came crashing down in April of 1983 when a car bomb ripped through the U.S. embassy in Beirut . Kennedy 's father was killed in the blast , and her life was forever changed . The anger she felt in the wake of the tragedy had led her to the CIA , and it did n't take Langley long to make up their mind about Kennedy . She had spent twelve years of her life growing up in the Middle East , she had a doctorate in Arabic studies , and she was motivated . Kennedy was earmarked from the very start for counterterrorism . Now , some sixteen years later , she was running the show at the Counterterrorism Center . But that was only part of Kennedy 's story the part that was reported to the legislative oversight committees . A separate job that fell under Kennedy 's purview was responsibility for the Orion Team , one of the most secretive organizations within the CIA . Only a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to stay that way indefinitely . It had to . The group had been formed by Director Stansfield in response to another terrorist incident . The downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , in December of 1988 . Irene Kennedy was given the reins and instructed to build a group with one single task to hunt down and kill terrorists . As Director Stansfield had said at the time , " There are certain people here in Washington who have decided it is time to go on the offensive . " Who those people were , Kennedy had never asked , and in truth , she never wanted to know . She only knew that she agreed with the strategy and was willing to risk everything to help implement it . That risk was very real , and by no means marginal . If the wrong people on the Hill , or over at Justice , ever got wind of the Orion Team , they would hold an inquisition , and Kennedy 's head would be the first one on the chopping block . The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach the escapades of Mitch Rapp and the Orion Team . In the political grandstanding that would take place under a congressional investigation , everyone would forget the fact that it was a war . The team would be portrayed as a group of rogue operatives with complete disregard for the Constitution . Someone like Rapp , who was at this very moment putting his life on the line , would be eaten alive by the country-club liberals and conservative opportunists looking to make a name for themselves . Kennedy felt the burden of responsibility for Rapp . She was the one that had gone to Syracuse University in the winter of 1988 and discovered him . He did not find the CIA as she had done after her father 's death they had found him . Thirty-five students from Syracuse had perished on Pan Am Flight 103 , and one of them had been Mitch Rapp 's high school sweetheart . Irene Kennedy had dangled the prospect of revenge in front of an anguished Rapp , and he had leapt at the chance without a moment 's hesitation . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite possibly the most efficient and lethal killer in the modern era of the Agency . President Hayes had heard enough . He pondered the ramifications for a long moment . If he chose not to act , the end result could cost American lives . Yes , he could lose men tonight , but these men had assumed a risk when they signed up . If he walked away , it could cost the lives of noncombatants . Hayes knew what he had to do . With a no-nonsense tone , the president asked , " General Campbell , what do you think we should do ? " In his clipped military tone , Campbell replied , " I think it 's an opportunity we ca n't pass up , Mr. President . " " Dr. Kennedy , I assume you think we should go in ? " asked Hayes . " Yes , Mr. President . " " Thomas ? " Hayes looked to the director of the CIA . Stansfield paused for a second and then nodded . The president turned lastly to General Flood . " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large hands and thumped them on the table once . " I think we should grab him . " President Hayes squinted at the map of Iran on the large screen while he thought about the potential risk . After about twenty seconds of silence , he said , " You have my authorization . " As soon as the sentence was completed , Kennedy and Campbell were on the phone giving the mission the green light to the various players and commands involved . Stansfield slid two white sheets of paper across the table . They were identical . One was for the president 's records , and the other was for Stansfield 's . The president grabbed a pen from his breast pocket and put his signature on both sheets . The relatively bland document was a presidential finding , required by law whenever the president authorized any type of covert mission . These simple documents had been a source of much controversy in Washington over the years . " When do you plan to notify the committees ? " asked President Hayes . By law , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate intelligence committees had to be informed of the intended action before it took place . This , however , was an area that was grayer than the London sky and one that was abused often , and sometimes for good reasons . Stansfield placed his signed copy in a folder and said , " Fortunately , the gentlemen in question all have plans for this evening . I will alert their aides that I need to speak to them in about an hour . If all goes well , they will not be able to make it out to Langley until after our people have safely completed their job . " " Good . " President Hayes stood and pulled on his cuff links . " My wife and I will be attending an event at the Kennedy Center . Where are you going to monitor the mission ? " " At Langley , " replied Stansfield . " Keep me updated , and good luck . " With that the president left the room .               @ @ @ @ @ @
