<p> For more than 20 years , Feseha Gebreab 's life has revolved around one animal : the donkey . Each day , in his modestly sized office decorated with donkey illustrations and photos , he thinks about how to make their lives better . It 's appropriate to his job title : Dr. Gebreab is director of The Donkey Health and Welfare Project , based at Addis Ababa University 's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Debre Zeit , Ethiopia . <p> The location is n't as random as it may seem . More than 5 million donkeys live in Ethiopia - more than in any other African nation , and second in the world only to China . Drive throughout the country and donkeys - in their gray and brown hues - are a frequent sight along the arid roads . The animal is indigenous to the country and well equipped for the climate and rugged landscape . It 's therefore one of the main sources of transportation . Farmers and peasants rely on donkeys to carry just about everything , including grain , fuel , dung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have on donkeys for their livelihoods - Gebreab stresses the animal is vital to the country 's economy - Ethiopians on the whole hold an exceptionally low regard for the animal . As a result , many are neglected and have health problems . Some succumb to treatable parasites . Many have back sores , the result of poor saddling and the fact that they frequently must carry up to twice their body weight . Sometimes they fall prey to hyenas , because - unlike the more-valued sheep or goat - donkeys are n't put into protective quarters at night . <p> Gebreab wants all this to stop . By offering free medical attention for donkeys as well as educational programs on how to take better care of them , he hopes to change Ethiopians ' views of the animal . <p> Such a shift in thinking could bear tangible results . In countries where donkeys are well cared for , they can live on average 27 years , according to The Donkey Sanctuary , a Britain-based charity that provides partial funding to Gebreab 's project . In Ethiopia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When an Ethiopian family loses a donkey , it can be a perilous moment . " For some families , " Gebreab says soberly , " a donkey means life or death . " <p> Mobile clinic hits the road <p> The heart of The Donkey Health and Welfare Project is its mobile clinic . Nearly every day , a small team of veterinarians drive out to rural areas , where they 'll meet with local villagers and their donkeys . <p> Ayele Gizachew , a spirited 30-something veterinarian , heads the project 's Mobile Veterinary Clinical Services . On a recent stop at a dirt cul-de-sac in the village of Tedde Dildima , he , along with three other workers , climbs out of a truck and sends a generous smile to the villagers standing in the midmorning sun . <p> On this day , Dr. Gizachew and his colleagues will treat about 200 donkeys . Some days , it can be more than 1,000 . The vets also offer practical advice , such as encouraging farmers to use cotton harnesses instead of synthetic ones to reduce the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each animal . <p> Gizachew eyes one donkey in particular - a female . The animal 's owner says she has been sick for more than a year and has miscarried twice in that time . She did carry one pregnancy to term , however , and as the two men speak , her foal comes to nurse . Soon , Gizachew discovers that despite the donkey 's thinness , she is in the last trimester of yet another pregnancy . He asks the farmer to give the donkey a break from working . But the farmer shakes his head . He can not , he replies , because he has no way to fetch water without the donkey 's help . <p> " I will try to convince him that it is not only this donkey who will die , but the foal , too . So he will lose two donkeys . " Gizachew says , " In our project , we ca n't supply other donkeys ; we only can offer treatment and educational services . " He pauses . " It 's heartbreaking - but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donkey does die , it will cost the man roughly $58 - about four months of work - to buy another one . That is why Gebreab and his colleagues emphasize to the villagers that taking better care of their animals now will benefit their financial and practical lives in the long term . <p> While the villagers socialize , the donkeys remain quiet . Occasionally , they nuzzle or lay their heads on one another 's backs . Gizachew notes this behavior and explains that donkeys are " highly manageable ... highly intelligent ... They are very gentle creatures . " <p> Educating future owners <p> Their agreeable nature makes donkeys especially useful to women , who are often charged with household chores . Children also work with the animals . Because of this , the project has implemented an educational program in local schools , hoping to get its message out to the next generation of donkey owners . In a classroom in the nearby village of Tullu Rea , third-graders wearing forest-green uniforms listen to a project worker explain how much weight a donkey should carry . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 kilograms , " or about 154 pounds , the teacher explains , " because you divide 210 by three . A donkey should carry no more than one-third of its body weight . " <p> Improving the life of the donkey in Ethiopia has always been particularly challenging , notes Elisabeth Svendsen , founder of The Donkey Sanctuary , which partnered with Gebreab in 1986 . <p> " From the beginning , the donkeys in Ethiopia were the worst of any we 'd looked at in the world , " she says . " They are very small animals , and yet they were worked very , very hard . The number of wounds was extraordinary " <p> But Dr. Svendsen says that the situation has changed for the better since the project began . <p> " We 've helped treat over 500,000 donkeys . That is definite progress . And the donkeys are beginning to live longer - up to five years longer , " she says . <p> This year , The Donkey Sanctuary will give more than $900,000 to Gebreab 's project - nearly double its usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , Addis Ababa . <p> " Dr. Gebreab is a very special man - always looking forward , and very dedicated to his work , " Svendsen says . <p> Back at the project 's main office in Debre Zeit , which houses an immaculate lab , surgical facility , and clinic , Gebreab still agonizes over the lowly status of the animal to which he has dedicated his career . " They are really important . The donkey is mentioned 80 times in the Bible , and yet the image of it is poor . This is what we are searching for - we are trying to understand why . " <p> He acknowledges that it does take some convincing that his work is relevant . " It is difficult , " Gebreab says . " This country has a lot of human problems ... Donkeys are not a glamorous species . First you are ridiculed , but then the discussion starts . Animal welfare is a difficult subject , but I think we are making some progress .
