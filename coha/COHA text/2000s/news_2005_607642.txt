<p> When baseball 's collective body gathers this week in Detroit for its annual All-Star Game , it will be without the game 's preeminent star  --  although , much as he has for this entire season , at the dawn of what is being called baseball 's Post-Steroid Era , Barry Bonds in absentia will cast a long shadow over the proceedings . <p> And in another month or so , when the injured Bonds might be ready to resume his assault on one of sport 's most hallowed records , baseball will be confronted with a problem for which it still does not have a solution : how to promote and manage the game 's most historic and controversial figure at a time when history and controversy could come together like never before . <p> With Bonds , 40 , out of the picture this season , nursing a knee injury that has required three surgeries in the past seven months , baseball has been able to shift the focus largely away from the steroid scandal that  --  with Bonds at its center  --  exploded this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-field stories , such as the unlikely rise to first place of the relocated Washington Nationals . <p> But the reprieve could be over by next month . San Francisco Giants officials believe Bonds , who last season won an unprecedented seventh most valuable player award , could be ready to get back on the field by mid-to-late August . And at that point , everything changes . <p> If Bonds returns in August , he could pass Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time home run list by the end of the season . Bonds enters his 20th big league season with 703 career home runs  --  roughly 37 percent of which have come since the 2000 season . Ruth , widely considered the greatest slugger in history before Bonds 's late-career surge , hit 714 in a career that ended in 1935 . <p> And if all goes well , Bonds could turn the 2006 season into a march toward the biggest milestone of all  --  Hank Aaron 's all-time mark of 755 career homers , arguably the most sacred record in all of sports . <p> Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , baseball might be preparing for an extended , glorious celebration like the one that greeted Cal Ripken 's breaking of Lou Gehrig 's consecutive games record in 1995 . But with Bonds , some believe , baseball 's strategy in the wake of the steroid scandal has been to ignore him in hopes he might go away . <p> " It makes for an awkward moment for baseball right now , " said longtime NBC and HBO commentator Bob Costas , author of " Fair Ball : A Fan 's Case for Baseball . " " It clearly is not a 100 percent feel-good moment , like past baseball milestone achievements have been . And I 'm sure that official baseball , no matter what they say , is at best ambivalent about him . " <p> Official baseball , of course , denies that . <p> " No one in baseball is happy to see Bonds out , " said Major League Baseball spokesman Rich Levin , speaking on behalf of Commissioner Bud Selig , who declined to be interviewed . When it was pointed out that baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Levin said : " If Bonds was playing when the season started , the steroid story would have kept going a little longer . But who 's to say it would n't have died down the way it has to this point ? " <p> Still , despite Bonds 's seemingly imminent return , there has been very little discussion of late within MLB 's offices about how to market the slugger 's resumption of the historic home run chase . <p> " This is a question I have n't had in awhile , and that has n't been discussed in quite some time , " said Kathleen Fineout , MLB 's director of marketing communications . " What would happen from Major League Baseball 's perspective is , we would acknowledge Bonds 's milestones in the same way we have recognized other milestones . " <p> Asked if Bonds 's involvement in the steroid scandal  --  in grand jury testimony leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle and published in December , Bonds acknowledged unknowingly using substances fitting the description of steroids  --  has tainted the sport 's marketing plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly has n't changed our thinking in terms of acknowledging the record should he return and eventually surpass the record , " she said . " But any additional promotional sponsorships regarding that record chase would involve the player , the club , Major League Baseball and our corporate sponsors . And those would not go into the discussion phase until he was closer to the record . " <p> In other words , said Chronicle sports columnist Ray Ratto : " Baseball is going to have to promote him while holding their noses . Unless . . . they lead him away in handcuffs , they 're going to have to fete him as if he really hit all those home runs  --  which , of course , he did . " <p> However , major corporate sponsorship of Bonds 's record chase may be out of the question . Within a week of the Chronicle 's publication of Bonds 's reported grand jury testimony , MasterCard , one of MLB 's biggest corporate sponsors , pulled out of a title-sponsorship deal it had been negotiating with the league in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts believe attaching a corporate name to Bonds at this point is too risky , given his public perception and any unknown revelations about steroids that may still come . <p> " If you promote the breaking of the record under the guise of innocent until proven guilty , but then 10 years down the road it 's proven definitively that he used steroids , " said Marc Ganis , president of Chicago-based consulting firm Sportscorp Ltd. , " you ca n't un-ring the bell . " <p> " He comes off as huggable as a cactus , " said Jim Bloom , vice president of marketing for Intersport Inc. , and a former marketing director for the Oakland Athletics and Toronto Blue Jays . " I think that 's more of a detriment than the steroid allegations . And I 'm not sure Barry cares about corporate sponsorships anyway . " <p> Although Bonds to this point has not been a target of the federal grand jury probe into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative ( BALCO ) , his personal trainer , Greg Anderson , is one of two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . And some who have followed the investigation closely believe the grand jury may indict Bonds on tax-evasion or perjury charges , based on its decision this spring to hear testimony from an alleged former girlfriend of Bonds . <p> Aside from the potential legal pitfalls confronting Bonds , there also is a question of whether he will be able to perform at his previous level upon his return . Although he has defied the standard norms of aging by posting his best seasons in his late thirties , Bonds will turn 41 July 24 and has never missed this much action in one stretch during his career . <p> " When he comes back , " Giants General Manager Brian Sabean said , " we do n't know what level of play he 's going to be at , or how many games a week or month he 's going to be able to play . " <p> Bonds would need to perform at a level close to that of recent seasons to be able to collect the 53 homers necessary to break Aaron 's record by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent at the end of that season , although he said recently that he hopes to play in 2007  --  preferably for the Giants  --  if he is within reach of Aaron 's record . <p> At this point , the Giants say they have no plans to discuss a contract extension with Bonds beyond next season . <p> Like that of MLB , the Giants ' own relationship with Bonds is complex . The franchise owes much of its financial success to him , as Bonds 's star power has made the Giants one of baseball 's top draws since its new stadium , SBC Park , opened in 2000  --  which is a good thing for the club , since the privately financed stadium reportedly carries a $20 million annual mortgage . <p> " The honeymoon for the new stadium , " Ratto said , " was extended by four years because of Bonds . " <p> However , even within the Giants organization it can sometimes be a chore to deal with Bonds and his superstar baggage . In the clubhouse , he is a separate entity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a separate locker belonging to one of his personal trainers  --  whom the team hired in order to be within MLB rules prohibiting non-employees . <p> Teammates who hope Bonds 's powerful bat can salvage the Giants ' season  --  the team , which has finished first or second in its division for eight straight seasons , is foundering in fourth place in the National League West division  --  also worry privately about what his return will mean for clubhouse unity . <p> " I want to have him back as soon as possible , " said pitcher Noah Lowry . " He 's a legend on this team . He 's definitely going to help us out . " However , when asked about the perception of Bonds within his own clubhouse , Lowry said : " I do n't have a comment on that . I do n't want to get in trouble . " <p> For his part , Bonds has all but stopped talking to the media , issuing updates about the progress of his knee on his Web site . Even his spokesperson , Rachael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring a reporter to the Web site . <p> " I 've talked to him , " Sabean said , " and he 's as determined as ever to come back now . He 's getting antsy . " <p> Although the team insists it is directing and monitoring Bonds 's rehabilitation , parts of it are occurring outside the organization 's influence , sometimes to embarrassing effect  --  such as when it was reported that Bonds has continued to train with Anderson , the personal trainer under indictment by the federal grand jury . <p> " We do n't approve of it , " Sabean said when asked about Anderson 's involvement . " But how do you prevent it ? " <p> Likewise , Bonds 's relationship with his fans in the Bay Area  --  always a trusted pocket of support for the slugger , even during the most trying of times  --  is growing increasingly complex as his absence gets longer . Fans who stood behind him during the steroid controversy of the winter and spring are beginning to question what is taking him so long to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning show host on all-sports KNBR in San Francisco , said callers to his program were running 2-to-1 or even 3-to-1 in support of Bonds last December , when the BALCO story hit , and in spring training , when a defiant Bonds sparred with the media during a memorable news conference . <p> " A lot of people thought the Chronicle should n't have published the testimony . They wanted the media to leave him alone , " Murphy said . " You can call it denial , I suppose , and that 's what it was . " <p> But now , Murphy said , the ratio of positive-to-negative callers is closer to 1-1 , or perhaps even tilting slightly against Bonds . <p> " People are beginning to say , ' What 's going on with this guy ? How long can a knee rehab take ? Is there something else going on ? ' " Murphy said . " They 're growing more and more sour on him , because his worst qualities are exacerbated by the off-field stuff , and his best quality  --  turning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we 're not getting to see . " <p> Murphy , who also holds Giants season tickets , attended the game on Oct. 5 , 2001 , when Bonds hit his 71st and 72nd home runs , breaking Mark McGwire 's single-season record . The atmosphere that night , he said , " was bedlam . " <p> " But that was 2001 , " Murphy said , " a lifetime ago for baseball fans , because of the way the steroids scandal has changed everything . That atmosphere will never be created again . "
