OOH , LA LA ! By Robin Wells Dorchester Publishing Robin Wells Marvin Goldman leaned back in his enormous leather chair , the one rumored to be made out of bull scrotum , and fixed his pale , beady eyes on Zack . " I got ta say , Duval , I admire your balls . " Zack Duval fought the urge to protectively cross his legs . The movie mogul 's testicle fixation gave him the creeps-which was exactly what Goldman intended . Everyone in Hollywood knew that the C.E.O . of Parapet Pictures had a nasty sadistic streak , and his office testified to the fact . The walls and ceiling were lacquered a hellish black , the floor was paved in black marble , and the only light in the room emanated from flame-shaped globes on top of tall torchiere lamps along the walls . The old man 's enormous glass desk sat on a recessed black pedestal , which made it appear to be levitating . All the old man needed was a pitchfork and horns to make the picture complete . " Yessir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' up here to pitch another movie after the way your last one tanked . " The short , paunchy studio head pulled his ever-present uncut cigar out of his mouth and pointed the damp , turdlike end at Zack like an accusing finger . " You went ten million over budget , and you did n't even deliver it in time for a holiday release . " It was an effort to sit still on the ergonomically incorrect metal bench , but Zack managed . Word had it that the bleacherlike seats in front of the movie mogul 's desk had been deliberately designed to make people squirm , and Zack refused to give the old goat that satisfaction . He might have to grovel , but he 'd damned if he 'd squirm . Goldman waggled his cigar again . " What was that friggin ' film called , anyway-Up In Smoke ? " Oh , hell-now he was going to have to play the old man 's vicious little name game . " ' The title was Trial by Fire . " Goldman 's lips pulled into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in smoke ' was what happened to all our hopes for it . " It was classic Goldman . Zack waited until the old man 's cackle had faded into a phlegm-filled cough , then forced a deliberate calm his voice . " As you know , the weather was a problem on that shoot . " Goldman made a low grunting sound . " Weather , Schmeather . A good director shoots around it . " " It 's a little hard to shoot around a flood when the movie 's about a forest fire . " Goldman narrowed his beady eyes . " You sayin ' I do n't know my business ? " Damn-it was always a mistake to disagree with Goldman . The old man had the fattest ego in Hollywood , but the thinnest skin , and he took the mildest dissent as a personal attack . " Of course not , Marvin . No one knows the industry better than you . I 'm just saying some things went wrong on that picture . " " Yeah . The main one being that I green-lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over his bulbous belly . The man 's odd physique had always reminded Zack of a child 's drawing of a person-a large circle for the body , a smaller circle for his bald , round head , then short , skinny sticks for the arms and legs . His cartoonish appearance was enhanced by the fact that his chair back rose a good foot higher than the top of his head . " The film before that fire fiasco was an even bigger flop . " Goldman reinserted the cigar in his mouth and contorted his mouth to speak around it . " You know the one-the one where everyone had microchips implanted in their brains . What the hell was it called ? Brain Truss ? " The vile old man was sub-human-a depraved , brutish , warped , malignant sore of a man , with a soul as black as the walls of his office . Unfortunately , he was also Zack 's last chance of ever making another movie . Zack unclenched his teeth just enough to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , right . Must have been my brain in a truss , givin ' that project the go-ahead . " Goldman let loose another ragged cackle . " What 's your excuse for that one ? " " Come on , Marvin-you know how things happen . There were a lot of unexpected delays and expenses on that shoot . " " Your job is to expect the unexpected . " " How could I expect that halfway through the shoot , the leading man would have a car accident that would leave him in a body cast for three months ? There were a bunch of other problems , too . " Zack lifted his hand and ticked them off , starting with his thumb . " Special effects could n't deliver as promised , the gaffers ' union staged a strike , the set designer quit in a huff , and distribution screwed up the ship date . " " You left one thing out , " Goldman snarled . " What ? " " You forgot to mention it was a lousy movie . " Zack choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . He pasted on a congenial smile . " I understand it 's doing well in some of the foreign markets . " Goldman glared at the agent , clearly irritated to have any ray of sunshine injected into this black hole of a meeting . " Oh , yeah , " he sneered . " It 's a big hit in northern Siberia . And I hear it 's got ' em linin ' up for miles in outer Mongolia . " He leaned back in his scrotum-upholstered chair and shook his head at Zack . " Like I said , Jackson , you got guts , darkenin ' my door again . " " Well , you 've got guts , too , Marvin , " Zack fired back . If he stroked the little ghoul 's colossal ego , maybe he could things around . " That 's why I came . " The old man 's eyes narrowed suspiciously , all but disappearing in his face . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Just that you trust your own instincts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're smart enough to know that a diamond is diamond whether it 's delivered in a blue box from Tiffany 's or found lying in the dirt . " " You sayin ' you 've brought me some dirty jewels , Jacksonl ? " Goldman 's lip curled around his cigar . " What are they-your family ones ? " Christ . Did n't the S.O.B . ever give it a rest ? " Sorry to disappoint you , Marvin , but I 'm talking about a script . I 've got a real jewel of a story , and since you have the option on my next movie , you get first shot at it . " The old man snorted . " First shot ? Hell , I 'm your first and your last , and do n't think I do n't know it . " Goldman leaned forward and stabbed his stogie in the air . " You know what they 're callin ' you ? Jinx . Jinx Jackson . Hell , I 'm the only studio head in town who 'll take a meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if you had the nerve to show up . " Bile , bitter and acidic , rose in Zack 's throat . He knew how things were in this business . Hell , he 'd been born into it-his grandfather had been an early film star , his father had been a big screen heart throb , and Zack himself had grown up in front of America , playing the precocious son of a small-town private eye in a popular T.V. series . He 'd been in Hollywood all of his life , and he knew it was an unforgiving town . Unforgiving , and superstitious . No one wanted to be associated with a loser . You were only as good as your last movie , and if you bombed , it was hard to get a second chance . It was even harder to get a third one . But that was exactly what Zack needed-another chance . And it was his lousy luck that his best shot of getting one was the miserable excuse for a human being sitting across from him . If Goldman took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be the kiss of death . Goldman 's chair creaked as he leaned back . " I 'm gon na give you a little advice . The Jackson name still has a lot of charisma , and you 're not too bad lookin ' . Maybe you ought to consider goin ' back in front of the camera . " Zack shook his head . " Acting 's not for me . " " You did all right for yourself as a kid . " Yeah , and he 'd hated it . He 'd hated waiting around , doing nothing more significant than trying not to wrinkle his pants , while all around him , the real action took place . The power was in the decisions . Big decisions , like what stories would be made into movies , which actors would play the roles , which footage would end up on the editing room floor and which would make it to the screen . Little decisions , like where the lights should be set , if the script needed tweaking , whether or not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the key to a film , but Zack knew they were just paint and hubcaps . The producer and the director were the ones who made it go . And in an increasing number of cases , the producer and the director were the same person . That had been Zack 's goal from early childhood : to become a producer-slash-director . A producer/ director had complete control of the picture from the first draft of the script to the final edit . And more than anything , Zack wanted control . His childhood had been one long set of instructions . Do this ; do that-no , not that way , this way . Smile . Do n't smile . Say this . Do n't say that . Like a poodle at a dog show , he 'd been carefully groomed , trotted out on a leash , and judged on how obediently he followed orders . When he grew up , he 'd promised himself , he would call the shots . And that was exactly what he 'd done . He 'd made nine feature-length movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , from beginning to end . He 'd found the stories , commissioned the scripts , sold the concepts , assembled the crews , directed the shoots , supervised the editing and coordinated the distribution . Each film had brought a fresh set of headaches and problems , but Zack had loved every minute of it . He loved the challenges , loved the creative process , loved the way each project completely absorbed him . Hell , he just flat-out loved movies . In movies , life made sense . People had clear-cut goals and motives , and it was easy to see the relationship between their actions and the outcome . Good was rewarded , evil was punished and the characters got to live happily ever after . Real life , of course , was nothing like that . In real life , love affairs always ended , friendships eventually fractured , and family ties-if they 'd ever existed in the first place-inevitably frayed and severed . Zack sometimes wished he had the ability to con himself like the rest of the populace . But growing up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendship were just gussied-up business arrangements . Like any business , they operated on the basis of supply and demand , and they only worked as long as both parties got an equitable exchange of goods or services . The fact of the matter was , people inevitably left you or let you down . Work was the only thing that could be trusted , the only reliable source of satisfaction . Unfortuately , Zack 's ability to work at the craft he loved was in the hands of the cigar-sucking , testes-obsessed gnome of a man squinting at him across the table . Goldman sucked on his stogie , making the sound of a boot being pulled out of thick mud . " I 'll tell ya what , Jackson-bring me a project that has you in it , and we 'll talk . " " Nah . I 'm no actor . " Goldman applied more suction to his cigar . " No director , either , judging from your last two pictures . " His last two pictures-was all that counted ? Did n't it matter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the business ? Apparently not . Zack 's stomach gnarled into a painful knot . Two strikes and it was all over . He was n't even going get a third time at bat . A desperate , grasping-at-straws gamble formed in his mind . What the hell-he might as well go for it . He rose to his feet . " Well , I wo n't waste any more of your time , Marvin . MGM wants a meeting , but I told them I had to talk to you first . Since you 're not interested , I guess that frees me up . " Zack strode to the door , his heart slamming hard against his chest . It was now or never . If Goldman let them walk out , his career was over . His hand was on the doorknob when Goldman finally spoke . " Aw , hell . As long as you 're here , you might as well give me what you got . " It was n't the most encouraging invitation he 'd ever received to pitch a project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathgrip on the doorknob and slowly turned . " If you 're not interested , there 's really no point . " " Sit down , dammit , and give me your pitch , " Goldman growled . Zack strolled back to his seat , trying to pretend his entire future did n't hang in the balance , trying to ignore the way his stomach coiled like a cobra , trying to act calm and cool and nonchalant . He lowered himself on the gawd-awful bench , drew a deep breath and plunged in . " As the opening credits roll , we find ourselves inside a brothel called the Ooh La La . We 're in New Orleans , and it 's the late eighteen hundreds . The set is lush-velvet drapes , Aubusson rugs , lots of mirrors , nude sculptures , elaborate gold-framed paintings . We hear voices-a woman 's laugh , the tinkle of crystal , piano music . The camera pans the room , picking up scantily clad ladies , expensively dressed men , and a blindfolded piano player banging out jazz . We see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera goes in tight on his hands , and then we 're in his point of view , seeing what he sees from under the blindfold . " Goldman stared at him , his expression blank as a movie screen after the last credit rolls . " We get little peeks of what 's going on in various parts of the room , " Zack continued . " We see a man 's hand up scooch up under some colored petticoats . We see a woman squeezing a man 's behind as they dance in the corner . We see a woman bend over to pour a man a drink , and we get a close-up of cleavage-I 'm talking major cleavage . " Zack held out his hands , as if he were palming a pair of basketballs . " Our piano player throws back his head . We see a large , gaudy chandelier on the ceiling , and next to it , a ribbon-covered swing . The swing is being lowered from the ceiling by a squeaky pulley . And then we see ... " Jake paused for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Zack nodded . " A stallion . A man leads it into the room . Everyone steps aside and stops what they 're doing-everyone except the piano player , who just keeps on playing . We 're still in his point of view , so we 're just getting little glimpses of the action . " Goldman pulled the cigar out of his mouth . That was a good sign . When Goldman took out his cigar , it meant he was interested . Encouraged , Zack continued . " First we see a close-up of the horse 's face . Then we get a glimpse of a young woman as she sits in the swing . We get a peek of her leg as she peels off her stockings , then a colorful whirl of petticoats being tossed through the air . We see another close-up of the horse 's face . We hear the swing being raised . We hear loud , bawdy voices . We see a close-up of a man , then a woman , then the horse . " Zack talked faster to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear murmurs of amazement . More close-ups of people 's expressions-shock , disbelief , revulsion , fascination . Another close-up of the horse , this time looking wild-eyed . The music gets louder . We see the piano keys , see the player 's fingers flying across them . " Zack paused for just a heartbeat . " And then we hear a long , loud whinny . " Goldman sat perfectly still , the cigar between his fingers , his hands on his belly , his eyes thoughtful . " Hmm . " A thrill of triumph shimmied through Zack . Throw in a little deviant sex , and Goldman 's interest level shot up like the thermostat on the back lot in July . The trick now was to keep him interested . " The horse is led out , " Zack continued . " The crowd applauds and cheers . The piano player 's eye pans the room and lands on a brawny , young delivery man in the back room , who 's just set down several boxes whisky . He 's staring through the doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to watch as the madame , a buxom old dame dripping jewelry , steps forward and says something like , " ' The Ooh La La is pleased to present Salome and the dance of the seven veils . ' " Goldman leaned forward . " The delivery man is the hero ? " Goldman was asking questions-man , oh , man , he was taking the bait ! Zack nodded . " His name is Joe , and he 's just come to New Orleans from the bayou . He falls in love with the dancer . Her name is Sadie , and it turns out she 's working in the brothel as an indentured servant . She 'd needed some quick cash for a noble cause-she paid for her grandmother 's treatment at a tuberculosis sanatorium-so she agreed to work for the madame for three years in exchange for a couple of thousand dollars . " Joe wants to pay off her debt and marry her , but he does n't have any money . He 's in despair at the thought of having to wait until her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a big boxing match that offers a purse of ten thousand dollars . Joe decides to go for it .
