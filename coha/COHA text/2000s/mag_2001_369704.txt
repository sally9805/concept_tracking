This singer-guitarist writes songs that have the lost , lonely feeling of the last drunk left in a dive bar at closing time . White is a country singer , but not necessarily from any country on this planet : several of the songs on this album were produced by members of the trip-hop band Morcheeba , and drawing from that group 's spirit , the tracks beep and buzz and whir like UFOs zipping across a prairie sky . There are a couple of meandering stretches where the disparate elements do n't quite come together , but any CD that features titles like Handcuffed to a Fence in Mississippi and God Was Drunk When He Made Me can be forgiven a few dull spots . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
