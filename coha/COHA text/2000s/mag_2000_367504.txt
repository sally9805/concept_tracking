In Warsaw she is known as Mrs. Big . It 's a reference not only to Barbara Lundberg 's physical stature ( 5 ft. 10 in. ) and no-nonsense New England manner but also to an audacious operating style that has in the past 10 years made her one of Warsaw 's most influential executives . As CEO of Elektrim S.A. , one of Poland 's biggest and oldest communist-era companies , Lundberg , 47 , admits that she attracts attention . " I think people find it amusing that a woman is president , " she says . In her case they also find it daunting . Late last year the conglomerate was on the verge of insolvency ; today , after Lundberg 's aggressive restructuring ( and a last-minute investment by the French conglomerate Vivendi ) , cash-flow problems are history and investor confidence is back : the stock price is up 100% since the beginning of the year . Now the former Wall Street banker wants to make Elektrim Poland 's foremost producer of interactive Internet content by year end . " She 's ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to succeed in this country , " says outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Poland Daniel Fried . <P> Lundberg was brought in as Elektrim CEO in February 1999 by institutional investors who had grown impatient with the previous management . The company had grown too quickly in the 1990s , says Lundberg , with interests in everything from chicken farms to electronic-cable manufacturing . Then reports leaked that the management had granted an option to an outside company for a 5% stake in Elektrim 's most valuable asset , the wireless firm Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa , or PTC . Major Western shareholders swooped in . Lundberg sold off interests in nearly 80 companies , slashing staff levels from 30,000 to 15,000 by last December . They will be down to 7,000 by the end of 2000 . <P> The former venture capitalist then refocused the company on telecommunications with acquisitions worth more than $1 billion . Today Elektrim boasts more than 2.5 million subscribers through its voice , video , mobile and fixed-line telephone networks . Early last year Elektrim clashed with the German giant Deutsche Telekom over a controlling interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a lawsuit launched by Deutsche Telekom in Polish courts blocked further investments and forced her to take out a loan that increased PTC 's debt load 55% . It took a last-minute $1.2 billion sale to Vivendi of a 49% share in a subsidiary that controls PTC to stave off disaster . " It was n't an experience that I would like to go through again , " she recalls . Even so , Lundberg is embarking on a new growth phase , investing $200 million over the next two years in Internet companies . <P> Lundberg is a rarity : an American in Poland with no Polish roots . A graduate of Wharton and a native of Lexington , Mass. , she moved to the country in 1991 , not for any sentimental reasons but to become the local head of the Polish-American Enterprise Fund , a U.S. government-backed effort to spawn new businesses in the post-communist nation . " I did n't necessarily make a decision to leave the U.S. , " she says , but " I felt that the potential was here in Poland . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's no sentiment or ethnic ties . She 's business . "
