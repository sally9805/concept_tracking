Interlinked crises of freshwater depletion , food insecurity , pollution loading and ecosystem decline stand in the way of poverty reduction and sustainable development. ( n1 ) These crises are exacerbated by changes in climatic regimes and associated disasters from floods , droughts and storms that further marginalize the world 's 2.7 billion people living in poverty . The planet 's oceans and their coastal interfaces are especially at risk , with livelihoods , food security , international trade and relations among sovereign nations at stake . The increased vulnerability of burgeoning coastal urban areas and the expanding footprint of coastal resource depletion are becoming increasingly significant liabilities . It is precisely at the coastal level that unsustainable development is creating the greatest risk for stability , security and economic progress . <p> Traditional sector-by-sector economic development strategies at the coasts of both developed and developing nations are responsible for this depletion , degradation and other serious risks to sustainability These strategies fail to recognize the importance of maintaining natural ecosystems for their value as life and economic support systems for our societies , and the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the North can cope with $20-30 billion disasters like Hurricane Andrew , but economies of developing nations cannot. ( n2 ) When problems arise , specialists often handle them thematically rather than in an integrated fashion that some might term " ecosystem-based approaches . " ( n3 ) Even the prevailing literature on the topic discusses ocean-related issues in a thematic manner . The problem is not one of " stateless space , " but rather one of unsustainable human use of coastal space  --  including seas space and the basins draining to fragile coastal areas that may now be exceeding their capacity to support communities . <p> This paper argues that traditional single-sector development activities and well-meaning actions under weak global instruments are insufficient to meet poverty reduction goals , sustainable development targets or stability and security objectives . Coupled with the fact that water , pollution and fish do not respect national boundaries , management of already complex coastal and marine systems is often made even more complicated by their transboundary nature and a lack of scientific under standing of the systems. ( n4 ) While governance reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address these realities , they are slow in coming . Natural buffer zones continue to be developed for urban use , and storm-devastated areas continue to be rebuilt despite the increased cost , risk and further coastal resource degradation . <p> When the poor and marginalized are ignored and their livelihoods lost , social disruption and instability lie ahead . In this paper , the connections between the land sea interface and poverty crises are examined in relation to global driving forces that negatively impact economies , deplete coastal resources and pose risks for unrest . Single-purpose international conventions adopted to address some of these concerns do so in fragmented , sectoral ways ; their effectiveness remains to be seen. ( n5 ) National responses to these instruments have been weak , with progress negated by decentralization policies that dump responsibilities on inadequately pre pared local institutions . <p> Broad global framework can not be the sole driver of action . Such frameworks are weak unless complemented by bottom-up , multistate regional collective action and joint institutional management arrangements that are capable of more effective stakeholder engagement and action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined area of land and sea , they become more tangible for stakeholders and reveal negative interactions and externalities among sectoral activities that might otherwise remain hidden . With the prospective benefits of enhanced regional integration and the building of trust and confidence among neighboring states , these bottom-up , multistate initiatives have the potential to increase regional stability by initiating cooperation on common issues like the coastal environment . With adoption of the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) and specific ecosystem-based targets in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation ( JPOI ) , world leaders have endorsed policy and institutional reforms to help achieve these goals while promoting sustainability. ( n6 ) <p> This article also identifies the need to develop long-term partnerships for enacting reforms among countries of the North and South centered on particular areas of sea space and adjacent basins . Without this integrated approach working at several scales of action , there is little opportunity to engage stakeholders in undertaking the necessary reforms and little possibility of meeting MDG and JPOI targets . Adopting such ecosystem-based approaches to managing human activities involving coastal and marine systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked with poverty reduction and climate adaptation efforts . Many countries need help in adopting these governance approaches . Consequently change agents and partners must work together in the transition to sustainability . Without the support of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) member states and multilateral institutions , little progress can be expected . <p> Some 120 states have been testing collaboration in adopting some of these reforms at the land-sea interface over the last dozen years through pilot projects funded by the " International Waters " focal area of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) . Initial outcomes of test cases at different institutional scales show promise as strategic partnerships are struck among participating nations , multilateral and bilateral organizations and UN agencies . The GEF projects are outlined in broad categories such as sustaining large marine ecosystems ( LMEs ) , linking rivers and seas and integrating coastal management . These projects from Africa , Asia and Eastern Europe illustrate how integrated approaches through mutual cooperation and collective action among sovereign nations can contribute to the transition to stability and sustainability for the resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interactions between saltwater , freshwater , land , living resources and communities at the coast grows more complicated every year as people move to the coast from inland areas , global trade forces the expansion of port systems and natural resource depletion accelerates . These are not the only driving forces threatening coastal sustainability . Others include rising sea levels due to global warming ; increased risk of disasters from storms ; increased vulnerability of the poor from encroachment in low areas ; depletion and pollution of freshwater sources ; population growth ; globalization of trade and economic systems ; agricultural and fisheries subsidies in the North ; and lack of appreciation for the need to use natural systems as buffers in coastal areas all conspire to increase the vulnerability of coastal areas . Yet it is these coastal areas , with their port systems , infrastructure , processing facilities and labor , that are most critical in enabling global trade to take place . Estimates that coastal and marine areas provide trillions of dollars to the world 's economies each year are too often ignored. ( n7 ) While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which economies can grow and communities can thrive , its limits are being exceeded while the marginalized groups living in these areas are becoming more insecure . The use of sea space can not be divorced from the security of communities that use it . <p> Continued overfishing of marine areas despite scientific the warnings , wearing down of food webs , the destruction of habitat and accelerated pollution-loading , have resulted in the dramatic collapse of coastal and marine ecosystems in both rich and poor nations . Meanwhile , ecological extinction from overfishing is the world 's most important cause of marine biomass depletion. ( n8 ) Recent analyses show that oceans have become depleted of large fish species , with only 10 percent of the original stocks remaining in some regions. ( n9 ) Modern technology and subsidized , distant factory fishing fleets from both OECD and larger developing countries have contributed to the overfishing problem and to worldwide ecosystem disruption . At least 75 percent of ocean fisheries are depleted , overfished or fished to their limits , according to recent UN Food and Agriculture ( FAO ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many subsidies and too little regulation , compete for the few remaining fish , leaving poor , artisanal fishermen without sufficient livelihood and food for their families . <p> Moreover , the neglect of natural buffer preservation in the mad dash to coastal urbanization has greatly increased vulnerability to storms , sea level rise and catastrophic damage to economies when global trade is disrupted . This increased risk was well-documented in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami in late 2004 where natural buffer areas were found to have provided an environmental service that reduced economic losses. ( n11 ) The destruction of important coastal habitats by urbanization , port development , agriculture and aquaculture has become wide spread , with impacts on livelihoods and food security for the poor as well as increased threats to the $60 billion-a-year international trade in fisheries products. ( n12 ) <p> Increased pollution loading from sewage , mud and nutrients ( e.g. , phosphorus and nitrogen ) represents a third form of increased risk for coastal communities . Land-based pollution loading , which contributes to 80 percent of marine pollution , continues to degrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to local economies and coastal communities. ( n13 ) Enclosed and semi-enclosed seas are at the greatest risk . Notable examples of the " dead zones " of oxygen depletion in the Chesapeake Bay , the Gulf of Mexico , the North Sea , the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea reflect the continued pollution-loading of rivers that degrade coastal and marine ecosystems. ( n14 ) The renowned Millennium Ecosystem Assessment , funded by the GEF , highlights that coasts are the most highly degraded ecosystems on our planet . Nearly two-thirds of the perhaps trillions of dollars of annual services provided to the global economy by natural ecosystems are in decline ; short-term economic benefits have been generated by running down the stock of natural capital assets , and this situation can not continue without further detriments to security. ( n15 ) <p> Coastal communities need water supplies to exist . Projections for demand over the next decade for many coastal freshwater surface and groundwater basins are dismal . The World Commission on Water described an impending freshwater crisis. ( n16 ) While the population of our planet tripled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2.5 billion people lack access to sanitation and 1.1 billion people lack access to water sources . While nearly 2 billion people live with water scarcity today , the number is expected to rise to approximately 4 billion  --  half the planet  --  by 2025 , unless radical reforms emerge . Agriculture , much of it subsidized with wasteful irrigation , is responsible for over 70 percent of global water use . Given existing policies , demand for water withdrawals will likely increase 40 percent by 2025 , as projected by the commission , in order to meet increased needs for irrigation . <p> Notwithstanding the unprecedented environmental disaster that has befallen many of the world 's rivers , lakes and deltas now depleted of water from overuse , the commission 's projected 40 percent increase in water withdrawals will trigger massive ecosystem collapse and social unrest , especially in downstream coastal areas , as noted by UN bodies. ( n17 ) There is just not enough water in many basin systems to support such increases , especially at the downstream river-sea interface . When fluctuating climatic regimes are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resource base will not be able to sustain growing populations , and resettlement will become inevitable . Indeed , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies noted in a recent assessment that for the first time in history , natural and environmental disasters have displaced more people than war , with about 34 million people affected. ( n18 ) The number of people affected by insecurity has increased four-fold since the 1970s , according to the assessment , further adding to disproportionate poverty FRAGMENTED GLOBAL FRAMEWORKS <p> The world community utilizes intergovernmental negotiating processes to devise international treaties that serve as the principal source of legally recognized rights and obligations among states . Many of the subjects of such global conventions are controversial , and the most that can be expected from the most controversial are framework conventions representing the lowest common denominator on an issue . Four single-purpose international conventions are directly related to the crises affecting the land-sea interface : the Convention of Biological Diversity , the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the International Watercourses . Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) <p> The CBD was negotiated in various sessions leading up to the 1992 Earth Summit , at which over 100 nations signed the treaty . About 185 parties have since become signatories . The CBD reflects a growing consensus that biodiversity conservation and management is an integral part of sustainable development . Many sectors of a nation 's economy depend directly or indirectly on the diversity of ecosystems and on the poor to utilize these assets to provide protein and livelihoods . <p> The convention 's objective is the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from its use , including genetic resources . Each party has a responsibility for conservation and sustainable use of its own biological diversity through its own processes , activities and institutions . Implementation is through national strategies , plans and programs that integrate with decision-making in sectoral activities . States are asked to establish priorities and report them to the CBD through strategies , plans and reports . Developed nations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEF has been charged with operating the financial mechanism for the convention . The Jakarta Mandate adopted under the CBD expresses country commitments to action to restore and sustain coastal ecosystems. ( n19 ) UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) <p> The UNFCCC was also negotiated in the sessions leading to the 1992 Earth Summit . The convention aims to minimize the negative impacts of global warming by returning concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to safe levels . However , it does not define " dangerous levels , " and much unfinished business remained after it was signed , including the development of commitments for industrialized countries that were subsequently outlined in the Kyoto Protocol . This protocol sketched out features of its mechanisms and compliance systems but did not determine the rules for operation . The rules were subsequently adopted in the Bonn Agreements and Marrakesh Accords in 2001 . By 2002 , 186 governments had become parties to the convention . <p> All parties must prepare and update national climate change mitigation and adaptation programs , including measures to address sources of greenhouse gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservoirs " ( e.g. , forests ) . Parties must also promote the development , application and transfer of climate-friendly technologies and practices as well as the sustainable management of carbon sinks . All parties are required to make preparations to adapt to climate change , compile inventories of emissions and submit national reports on the actions they take to implement the convention . Consistent with the Kyoto Protocol , industrial nations are to demonstrate their leadership in addressing climate change by adopting corresponding policies and measures aimed toward the non-legally binding target of returning greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 . Developed nations are also required to provide financial resources to developing nations . As with the CBD , the GEF has been charged with operating the convention 's financial mechanism , and programs for addressing adaptation are currently under way In fact , the GEF has been named to operate the three adaptation funds : the Least Developed Countries Fund , the Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol . UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted in 1982 as an unprecedented attempt by the world community to regulate all aspects of the sea 's resources . It entered into force in 1994 , and 137 nations and the European Union have become parties . The convention establishes basic obligations of states to protect , conserve and manage the marine environment in various zones within and beyond national jurisdiction . Within continental shelves and exclusive economic zones ( EEZs ) , individual coastal states have been designated certain powers . The treaty defines the rights and obligations of states fishing on the high seas and calls on them to prevent , reduce and control pollution from land-based sources , the atmosphere , dumping , vessels and installations used to explore and mine the seabed . It outlines the general obligation for all states to take measures against pollution , including the establishment of national rules , standards , practices and procedures as well as to cooperate with neighboring states at the regional level . <p> As a framework convention , UNCLOS was intended to be supplemented by sub sequent regional agreements for specific shared waters , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While specific treaties were subsequently enacted that relate to fisheries , only a weak , voluntary action program exists regarding Articles 207 and 213 , which addresses pollution and other land-based activities that degrade coastal waters . In 1995 , after 10 years of dialogue , an intergovernmental meeting was convened in Washington , DC , at which 109 countries adopted the Washington Declaration and its Global Program of Action ( GPA ) for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities . The GPA specifies actions at global , regional and local levels in nine thematic areas . It does not establish a financial mechanism . However , it invites the GEF to build upon the work of the GPA and to fund activities consistent with the GEF Operational Strategy . Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses <p> After 24 years of negotiations , the International Law Commission of the United Nations developed a set of 32 draft articles in 1994 which were adopted with revisions by the UN General Assembly in 1997 as the Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language similar to the 1966 Helsinki Rules which require riparian states along an international watercourse to exchange data , cooperate in management , protect basin ecosystems and notify each other of the possible adverse effects of planned actions . Although the draft convention is open for signature , very few nations have signed . This effectively leaves a gap in the global convention framework on fresh water , and , in turn , leaves a further gap when integrated approaches are pursued among conventions or for commitments to reforms at the land-sea interface . While concerns about climate change and biodiversity loss have led to global conventions that make at least a start toward reversing the situation , the political economy of water and its characteristics as a public good continue to serve as barriers to global commitments on water resources . <p> Fragmented global approaches among single-purpose secretariats and conventions with different focal points have resulted in narrow implementation . The depleted state of the resource base , the poverty of the inhabitants and the future risks to sustainability underscore that these sectoral approaches taken in isolation do not work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sector-specific country programs in the developing world that further fragment the situation . Because attention to implementation and reporting is based on political units and single-purpose themes rather than on ecosystem-based hydrologic or marine units , opportunities to tackle interlinkages among the crises may be missed . Persistent lack of funding narrows implementation further as ministries compete for resources . While global regimes may be capable of only a weak , framework-based response , regional efforts aimed at building trust and confidence for collective action on site-specific concerns have the potential to succeed from the ground up . These efforts on a multi-country scale have been pursued by the GEF as an alternative approach to top-down global regimes as well as an alternative to dispute resolution. ( n21 ) ROLE OF THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY <p> The GEF was established in 1991 as a pilot multilateral financial mechanism to test innovative ways to respond to global environment challenges in its four focal areas of climate change : biodiversity conservation , ozone depletion and international waters . Following 18 months of negotiations , an agreement was reached in Geneva in 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent financial mechanism . The restructured GEF , with its $3 billion trust fund , is open to universal participation , and 176 countries are currently members . The GEF Council , which establishes the policies , consists of 32 constituencies representing all the countries of the world , with 14 council members from donor countries and 18 from recipient countries . Following restructuring , the GEF Council adopted an operational strategy defining the GEF 's strategic framework for action in its focal areas as a major catalyst for improving the global environment within the context of sustainable development. ( n22 ) <p> The GEF builds upon a partnership among the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) and the World Bank . These three organizations can access funding on behalf of developing countries and those in economic transition for activities consistent with the GEF operational strategy . In restructuring the GEF , governments ensured that it fully embodied the principles that were set out in the Rio Conventions and in the action program known as Agenda 21 . The GEF has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CBD and serves as a mechanism for international cooperation in providing new and additional finance to meet the agreed incremental costs of measures that result in global environment benefits . Since its creation in 1991 , the GEF has allocated $6 billion in grant financing supplemented by $18 billion in cofinancing for 1,700 projects in 160 developing countries , with most of the funds devoted to climate change and biodiversity projects , consistent with the conventions and guided by the conferences of the parties. ( n23 ) <p> The GEF operational strategy outlines the types of activities that the GEF may support in the different focal areas . While many of the projects concerning climate change and biodiversity support implementation of the conventions , some of the project benefits spill over to other areas . For example , some biodiversity projects have explicit benefits for carbon storage but are accomplished principally for biodiversity purposes . International waters , meanwhile , have no single convention for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism . Instead , the GEF Council provides guidance through the operational strategy . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focal areas and are addressed through place-based hydrologic or marine-coastal ecosystem units , rather than simply through political units or sectors. ( n24 ) GEF Processes Facilitate Joint Management Regimes <p> Within the international waters focal area , countries face complex problems that are transboundary by nature . The operational strategy provides for the GEF to contribute primarily as a catalyst to the implementation of comprehensive , ecosystem-based approaches for managing transboundary waters and their contributing drainage basins. ( n25 ) The GEF implementing agencies assist states in finding means of collaborating with neighbors in order to change the way that human activities undertaken in different economic sectors place pressure on freshwater and marine environments. ( n26 ) The goal is to help countries use the full range of technical , economic , financial , regulatory and institutional measures to operationalize sustainable use strategies for transboundary bodies of water and their contributing basins . This often involves a change in activities occurring on land , so that pressure on the coastal water body may be reduced . It also aims to assist countries in establishing joint management institutions for agreed collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from improved mutual understanding and trust among neighboring states that may have been in conflict to increased security of marginalized communities and positive steps toward regional integration . <p> Since 1992 , the GEF has funded $900 million for 105 projects involving 135 different nations in the international waters focal area , with a total cost approaching $4 billion. ( n28 ) Projects addressing marine ecosystems , risks from marine transport , fisheries and linking freshwater-coastal systems represent 70 percent of the portfolio . GEF Processes Facilitate Multi-country Collaboration <p> The GEF Operational Strategy recommends that states begin to address coastal and marine issues by jointly undertaking a number of strategic processes that may lead not only to site-specific collective action , but also to joint management institutions to sustain the future of these processes . Box 1 presents the GEF process tools for facilitating collective action at the multistate , regional scale. ( n29 ) National inter-ministry committees have proven essential in engaging different ministries and sectors that must enact reforms if sustainability is to be achieved . The Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis ( TDA ) supports a process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a framework for setting priorities upon which an ecosystem-based approach to management can be developed. ( n30 ) More importantly , TDA can be used to engage stakeholders within the area so that they contribute to the dialogue and support this approach as implemented by communities and governments . Without such participatory processes , marine science has often remained confined to the scientific community or has not been embraced in policymaking . <p> The process of producing a Strategic Action Program ( SAP ) facilitates the development of pathways for commitments to action that address priorities and change the way sectoral activities are conducted . Through political processes , states can then agree to work on priorities individually and jointly Complex , site-specific , land-sea conflicts can be divided into smaller , manageable ones with a series of state-specific actions . The shared vision within the SAP helps provide focus to multistate collaboration and has proven essential in GEF projects geared toward securing commitments for policy , legal and institutional reforms for integrated management . If states agree to undertake the reforms , then the GEF may fund subsequent implementation projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments . PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO SUSTAIN LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS ( LMES ) <p> In 1995 , the GEF Council included the concept of LMEs in its Operational Strategy as a vehicle to foster ecosystem-based management and to address the land-sea interface in the international waters focal area . LMEs are regions of ocean space encompassing coastal areas from river basins and estuaries to the seaward boundaries of continental shelves , enclosed and semi-enclosed seas and the outer margins of current systems . They are relatively large regions on the order of 200,000 km or greater , characterized by distinct bathymetry , hydrography , productivity and trophically dependent populations . Ninety-five percent of global capture fisheries come from the 64 LMEs that parallel continental shelves and potentially represent management units for reversing fisheries depletion. ( n31 ) Table 1 presents the full list of approved LME projects . With four additional LME projects currently under preparation with GEF funding , 126 different nations  --  including 16 OECD nations  --  are cooperating to secure the future of the coastal oceans and their land-sea interfaces . <p> An example from Africa illustrates the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BCLME ) is a large coastal upwelling off the shores of South Africa , Namibia and Angola . The cold current creates one of the world 's largest fisheries , but it also creates a desert climate and water scarcity for those living in basins draining to the LME . Livelihood , protein and economic opportunities are limited and must be secured through sustainable use . The three governments requested assistance from the GEF for a project on the sustainable management and utilization of living marine resources , the reduced mining impacts at the coast , the management of land-based pollution and the protection of biological diversity . The project aims to strengthen capacity for ecosystem forecasting in order to adapt to fluctuating climatic conditions that threaten the fishery . During a 12-month project development period , the three governments reached consensus on their shared future , based on the formulation of a TDA and SAP , the latter of which was signed in 2000 by ministers from each nation . These national dialogues , which were fostered by inter-ministry committees , proved to be an important factor in aligning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated fashion . Box 2 presents some key elements of the SAP . <p> The BCLME countries agreed to establish an Interim Benguela Current Commission ( IBCC ) , which will be supported by the science-based advisory groups that originally produced the TDA. ( n32 ) Within a period of five years , the IBCC is to become a fully functioning Benguela Current Commission with signature of a treaty by the end of the project . In addition to joint management of fisheries , the IBCC is developing a regional framework for enhancing consultations to mitigate the negative impacts of mining , particularly any potential or actual conflicts among fisheries , coastal diamond and gold mining , and oil and gas exploration and production . This is important to ensure that land-based activities do not destroy sea-based livelihoods in this fragile area of coastal deserts. ( n33 ) PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO LINKING RIVERS AND SEAS <p> The 17 nations draining to the Black Sea through the Danube , Dnieper and Don River basins face a variety of shared environmental problems that are transboundary in nature . Sources of nitrogen and phosphorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Sea . Through a series of GEF-assisted projects since the early 1990s , the nations have identified the excessive release of nutrient pollution from agriculture , municipal and industrial sources as their top-priority transboundary water problem , and have moved to address this in conjunction with EU enlargement . <p> The Danube basin nations approached the GEF in 1992 , as did the six nations surrounding the Black Sea . The states learned to work together-even during the Balkan wars of the 1990s  --  to set priorities related to the most serious transboundary problems and and to decide what interventions were needed to address them . The commitments made in the two SAPs to integrate land and water resource management programs for the restoration of the Danube Delta and Black Sea , also included a cap policy on nutrient releases at 1997 levels as an interim objective for governments to hold the line on nutrient pollution . This includes Germany and Austria , which agreed to nutrient reduction measures ( principally agriculture nutrient reductions ) in the SAP as part of commitments under the basin treaty . A unique strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UNEP , World Bank , the European Union and GEF for streamlined assistance to single-state , sectoral investments that reduce nutrients and restore floodplains for multiple purposes . <p> The Black Sea is already improving in terms of water quality and ecological indicators as a result of a decade of pollution reduction. ( n34 ) The 10 years of GEF interventions have accelerated reforms and investments to reduce land-based sources of pollution and have helped to ensure that future increases are minimal . A mid-term progress report of this partnership was recently presented to the GEF Council. ( n35 ) The document shows that over the last 15 years , nitrogen has been reduced by 20 percent in the Danube River and phosphorus by 50 percent . No large river ever experienced this before . There has been a concomitant reduction of oxygen depletion and algae downstream at the land or sea interface with the Black Sea , as the report notes . However , the largest change has been in the reduction of subsidized fertilizer application in Eastern Europe . Figure 1 illustrates this trend in fertilizer application that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The impact of this improvement on the Black Sea demonstrates the importance of reducing pollution loading in rivers that drain to the sea . Figure 2 outlines features of this strategic partnership that are now being studied in other regions . PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO SUSTAINABLE USE OF FISHERIES <p> The GEF 's LME projects are testing how the integrated management of oceans , coasts , estuaries and freshwater basins can be implemented though an ecosystem based approach . The approach has also been tested for large areas of oceans and the high seas between EEZs . The Western Tropical Pacific Warm Pool LME is the lifeblood of Pacific island economies with rich tuna fisheries that provide one-third of the world 's tuna supply . Heads of state of the 13 cooperating island nations adopted their GEF Strategic Action Program in September 1997 and began implementation of their GEF/UNDP international waters project. ( n37 ) Components of this project involved community-based management of the land-sea interface , community-based fisheries , integrated coastal management ( ICM ) and interventions to protect their water supplies . Another component was support through the Forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their highly migratory fish stocks . Known formerly as the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean , GEF assistance helped level the playing field among the Pacific islands as they negotiated the convention with respect to interests of distant fishing nations. ( n38 ) <p> Following seven negotiating sessions , the convention was signed in September 2000 . It is the first of its kind to be successfully negotiated on the basis of the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement under UNCLOS . GEF has responded to this political commitment to sustainable fisheries with the approval of a project request from the Pacific island states . They asked for assistance in establishing the commission and completing the necessary legal and institutional framework for managing the trans boundary oceanic fish stocks within their ecosystem . The capacity of the commission is being built up , and its regulatory apparatus at the regional and national scales would work to strengthen fisheries legislation and programs to implement convention requirements . By the end of the project , the commission processes should no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support joint management . PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT <p> The GEF also works at the scale of municipalities and coastal provinces in terms of integrated management . Such efforts are part of their renowned GEF Partnership for Environmental Management of the Seas of East Asia ( PEMSEA ) . ( n39 ) Process tools similar to the LME projects are utilized at the local scale to foster integration , participation and reform processes through ICM . The GEF PEMSEA activities in Xiamen , China are just one example of its work with one dozen local areas to complement the top-down LME approaches in East Asia . In the Xiamen case , local university staff assisted in conducting an environmental inventory ( equivalent to a TDA ) and participated in producing a diagnosis , analysis and strategy for addressing local environment concerns . The zoning of sea space for different uses based on consultations with stakeholders is illustrated in Figure 3 . This demonstration of science-based zoning was so successful that the Chinese government adopted this approach for the entire land-sea interface through a national law based on the GEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning , this local application of GEF processes is being applied to local jurisdictions in many East Asian nations through PEMSEA assistance to resolve land-sea disputes among different interest groups . Establishment of ICM programs can have a cascading effect . They can transform deficient governance , improve awareness of important ecosystem assets , serve as a catalyst for reforms that spur additional private sector investments , promote sustainable development and secure livelihoods for marginal communities that often reside at the coast. ( n40 ) <p> Moreover , the water , living resources and marine transport systems all have transboundary attributes ( see the illustration of currents in the region in Figure 4 ) , and collective action among states is appropriate and critical to protect these assets for the future . Such collaboration through PEMSEA , including the participation of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , helps to overcome suspicions among governments and can contribute to increased regional integration and stability . In addition , working jointly can build capacity among less sophisticated nations and can raise awareness of new concepts . The PEMSEA project included ICM demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Straits of Malacca . An economic valuation of the coastal and marine resources of the straits estimated the waterway 's value at approximately $5.13 billion annually , of which only $1.47 billion were accounted for by net market values. ( n41 ) With all East Asian countries dependent on shipping through the straits , this demonstrates the degree to which shipping revenues pale in comparison to the long-term inherent value of sustaining the bounty of nature . CATALYZING PLACE-BASED PARTNERSHIPS FOR SUSTAINABILITY <p> Whether undertaken at the transboundary scale in LMEs or at the local scale as part of integrated coastal management , place-based participatory processes are proving helpful in developing politically viable ways for improving management of the land-sea interface and adjacent marine waters . Sound science is providing valuable information to policymakers as part of these processes , and the use of specific geographic locations to pilot ecosystem-based management may be able to engage stakeholders more effectively than global proclamations or national sector programs . Without such engagement , reforms needed for further integrated management will remain elusive . <p> The processes of formulating a shared commitment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local-scale ICM coastal strategies have proven essential for catalyzing long-term partnerships that can enhance commitments to action and help with the wrenching transition to sustainability Bilateral and multilateral institutions and UN agencies are realigning their priorities toward state-driven strategies developed in these GEF projects . Countries are cooperating in establishing adaptive , joint management structures as a result of GEF requirements for establishing indicators for monitoring and evaluation purposes . This has led governments to adopt their own LME and ICM-specific ecosystem targets so that they may track progress on the ground and subsequently enact conventions or protocols to express their joint commitments . The broad goals laid out in the JPOI are important , but more customized , focused targets included in the GEF projects may be useful in stimulating progress . GEF is bringing the North and South together around their particular LMEs to jointly adopt reforms and undertake pilot investments , with the notable collaboration among 16 OECD nations and their developing neighbors . The Danube/Black Sea Basin Strategic Partnership exemplifies what is needed for specific LMEs in the long term . <p> Likewise , the Benguela SAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal African nations , the World Bank , FAO and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature . This partnership was recently presented to the GEF Council to assist African nations in meeting JPOI targets through investment-lending operations , technical assistance , policy reform and poverty-reduction strategy credits. ( n42 ) In particular , the relation between distant fishing nations and these coastal states needs to be realigned toward sustainable use in order to reverse what looks like an insecure and depleted future for coastal communities of Africa . It has been the GEF position since the Johannesburg summit that long-term partnerships among rich and poor nations sharing benefits from particular sea space , as well as the array of development assistance organizations , are necessary to meet sustainable development goals. ( n43 ) The processes designed cooperatively by developing nations and their OECD partners are showing early signs of success in the development of such longer-term partnerships . However , limited GEF financing confines its catalytic role to pilot demonstrations . The transition to integrated approaches takes time , capacity , money and political goodwill . Scaling up to what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international community . CONCLUSION <p> Our planet 's fragile oceans and coasts are too economically and socially valuable to allow resource depletion to continue . Sea space is often used in an unsustainable manner for short-term gains . As a result , many coastal communities and perhaps some nations are simply living on borrowed time before the nearly $60 billion-a-year international trade in fisheries collapses , depleted groundwater supplies for coastal cities run dry and burgeoning coastal urban populations overwhelm their degraded and polluted natural resource base . This sea space is not the high seas , but rather the coastal oceans embodied by LMEs that should be under sovereign management through UNCLOS . Traditional sectoral management strategies are destined to produce more depletion and degradation , leading to increased insecurity for the poor . This issue transcends technical tradeoffs over limited fisheries , damage wrought on coastal margins by marine transport or upstream pollution loading . At risk are global trade systems , national economies , regional stability and the security of coastal communities . All it takes is one large disaster to disrupt vulnerable coastal economies and trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together 126 different nations in piloting place-based engagement processes needed to address risks to their coastlines and marine waters . In these early test cases , multistate action at the transboundary and local level action at the integrated coastal management level seem to be making progress as competing nations , ministries , fishermen and the business community work to reap the multiple benefits that can accrue from sustaining goods and services provided by coastal ecosystems . The processes are building trust and confidence as they aim to operationalize shared commitments to action . These processes allow for sequential capacity building , conflict resolution , technology introduction , policy reforms and investments aimed at restoring delicate balances . <p> With more than 200 million people around the world depending on fisheries for food security and livelihoods , and virtually all economies depending on trade conducted through risky marine transport , it is easy to see why ocean security must be placed higher on the political agenda if poverty reduction goals , regional integration and stability are to be achieved . GEF embraced this challenge in the early 1990s , and early experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainable development of coasts and oceans . The bottom-up approach of multistate cooperation may be providing an important strategy to complement the traditional one involving the negotiation of global commitments in conventions . Agreement on specific regional priorities addressed through appropriate state-specific mechanisms has the potential to make more progress than legalistic interpretations of weak global framework treaties . <p> It is important to continue to track the progress seen so far in GEF-funded test cases . In the Danube/Black Sea basin , the future sustainability of GEF-funded progress lies not with GEF but with EU enlargement policies incorporating the downstream considerations of land-sea interactions . Elsewhere in the world , other organizations must take up the cause of the land-sea interface following pilot-scale successes if security and stability are to be achieved among competing communities and nations . <p> The North spends almost $1 billion daily on agricultural and fisheries subsidies that damage ecosystems , while it spends less than one-seventh of that on development assistance . Government subsidies have contributed to modernization and overcapitalization of fleets , which have resulted in the downward spiral of marine ecosystems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities turn the corner . It is clear that the MDGs and the Johannesburg targets will not be achieved without restoring biomass to depleted coastal ecosystems for trade , food security and increased livelihoods for the poor . Coastal communities will not flourish in the age of global trade unless their populations are safe , their water supplies and income sources secured , and their vulnerability to droughts , floods and storms reduced . All this takes time , political will and capital , and it needs to be done as part of the transition to the ecosystem-based approach to managing human behavior . At Johannesburg , the world community finally recognized the value of water-related ecosystem goods and services to poverty reduction and the global economy It is now time to scale up partnerships to meet this enormous challenge of securing the future of marine ecosystems and their adjacent coasts . <p>
