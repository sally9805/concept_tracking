COLLEGE BASKETBALL Toughness and steadiness form the foundation of Pittsburgh 's mettle , but this team has more flash than past Panthers squads // A remote control rests in Jamie Dixon 's left hand , but it might as well be a magic wand . As he watches tape on a flat-screen TV in the back of his office , Dixon makes dead air disappear . As one play unfolds , he points his right index finger at the screen and makes an observation . When it ends , his left hand zaps the players into a fast-forward frenzy until more action is found . Dixon never misses a significant bounce of the ball . And you think you 're good at skipping over the commercials . " Good screen there , " Dixon says as he points to his junior forward Chevon Troutman . Zap . " Chris ca n't fade away like that ; he 's ending up near the 3-point line , " as freshman center Chris Taft misses a turnaround . Zap . " There ! Every player is doing exactly what he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralizes an on-ball screen . Zap . " We emphasized that play in practice all week , " Dixon says as senior forward Jaron Brown cuts through the lane for a layup after receiving a pass from Taft on the left wing . Stop . Instant action is n't how most view Pitt . Is n't it the team that brings methodical to the Madness ? Controlling the tempo . Working the shot clock . Tough , physical defense . Dixon finds the notion that his team only likes to " muddy " up games almost amusing . Almost . " You know , just because we 're from Pittsburgh , people will focus on the toughness , the defense . No one wants to talk about how good we are offensively . " That Pitt 's offense is better than most think is n't the only sleight of hand at work . Behind coach Ben Howland and point guard Brandin Knight , the Panthers stormed the scene two seasons ago with a 29-6 record , a No. 3 seeding in the NCAA Tournament and a trip to the Sweet 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a No. 2 seed and another trip to the Sweet 16 . When Howland left for UCLA and Knight 's eligibility expired , the Panthers still were expected to be good . But not 24-2 good . And these Panthers do n't look like they will vanish after the Sweet 16 . Photograph Krauser is a better shooter than his predecessor at the point . Photograph The Panthers wo n't be satisfied unless they make it all the way to the Final Four . // The personification of Pittsburgh , as you know , usually goes like this : a weathered face with smokestack haze in the eyes and a strong jaw ; barrel chest ; thick forearms , leading to calloused hands , with perhaps one of them holding a cold can of Iron City . Hearing Villanova coach Jay Wright say , " When you think of Pitt , you think of toughness , " would cause a stream of smiles up and down the Three Rivers . But accessorizing the blue collars of these Panthers are a diamond stud and some gold cuff links . The last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't a gasp when when they failed to reach the Elite Eight , much less the Final Four . Those teams lacked the athleticism and firepower present in this year 's squad , largely because point guard Carl Krauser now is a starter and Taft has been added . Knight was excellent-tough , defensive-minded , a great leader and playmaker . But he was a weak shooter and lacked great explosion . Krauser , who averaged 18.6 minutes a year ago , has brought a playground flair that rings true to his Bronx roots . Krauser can be unstoppable on the drive and when breaking down a defense with his dribble . " I think the initial feeling was that Pitt lost a lot , particularly Knight , " says Boston College coach Al Skinner . " But they still play with that same composure , and Krauser gives them that little something they may not have had before . " Louis Orr , whose Seton Hall team is one of two teams to beat Pitt this year , says , " Knight had a toughness about him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the best offensive point guards around . " It 's not easy losing Brandin Knight and still have the success they are having . A lot of that credit goes to Carl Krauser . " Krauser is n't as good as Knight defensively , but Krauser 's quickness and aggressiveness in the passing lanes still make him an asset on that side of the ball . He can be a little too daring at times . With Pitt trying to kill the clock with a lead over Connecticut on February 15 , Krauser lofted an alley-oop pass toward Troutman with about 1 minute to play . For a team that relies on being smart , that play was anything but . Whether he can make the right plays in the pressures of the tournament is still an unknown , but this is hardly a player who 's out of control . Krauser is just a little more unpredictable than your average Panther , and that 's not all bad , especially considering opponents also must try to guess what he 's going to do next . Pitt quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it keeps adding players like Taft . He gives the team another layer defensively because of his size ( 6-10 , and a still-developing 230 ) and shot-blocking ability . Taft needs refinement ; he 's a baby in his development . Still , you can see he 's a surefire NBA player , perhaps the only one on the team . Senior guard Julius Page calls him " Big Ticket . " Brown calls him " The Franchise . " Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim says this year 's Panthers play a style " that 's a duplicate of what they have been doing , really . They are the same team , except they got a better center . Chris Taft is tremendous . I think he 's in the top echelon of centers in the nation . He can score . He can rebound . He can block shots . What else is there ? " Howland is about 2,500 miles away now , but his presence still can be felt in Pittsburgh . He recruited or coached all of the players , and the team still adheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Howland to be the program 's top assistant in 1999 , talks to Howland nearly every day- " Life first , basketball later , " Dixon says . Howland 's daughter , Meredith , who is a student at Pitt , stayed with the Dixons for part of Christmas break . Athletic department staffers share stories about Howland , like he was the favorite uncle who could n't make it back for the family reunion . Dixon , though , drives this program now , and there have been few bumps . From the Steelers ' disappointing year to the Penguins ' wretched one to the lack of spring optimism surrounding the Pirates ( again ) , Pittsburgh sports followers are eager to embrace these Panthers . One sports radio talk-show host even made callers repeat the phrase , " Pitt good , Steelers stink " before allowing them on the air one afternoon last week . Dixon might not have much of a national profile yet , but he is a rising star in the area . Not that he has noticed much . When asked if he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seems he does n't get out much . He has a 21-month-old son and another baby on the way ( his wife , Jacqueline , was scheduled to be induced after the Panthers played Georgetown earlier this week ) . Dixon hates to shop , and Jacqueline usually makes his lunch . There 's a reason he 's so good with that remote control . Dixon 's coaching touches have been subtle but effective . He gave Krauser the loose reins he needs to make the most of his talent , and he has succesfully incorporated more of a post-up attack , not just with Taft , but also with Troutman and Brown . It 's way too early to say whether the Panthers are better off with Dixon . But it 's also , at least for now , impossible to say they are worse . What is " old " still is what best defines these Panthers . " Pitt is as an old-school team , " Villanova 's Wright says . " And every coach means " old school " in a positive way . They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just an intimidating team to face . " The defensive mantra : Contest every possession . Sounds simple , but beating it is complex . " We just do n't give up easy shots , " says Dixon . " That has more to do with the slow tempo of our games than anything we 're doing on offense . If we gave up easy shots , the games would move a little faster . " The way the Panthers shift with each pass and help one another on screens in their man defense is so rhythmic it should be put to some music other than the sounds of squeaking sneakers . And it helps that Page , Troutman and Brown all are among the best defenders in the nation at their respective positions . The offensive mantra : Make that extra pass . There is an emphasis in recruiting on finding players who know how to dish . Unselfish play is the Pitt way . It is common to see each player force up one bad shot a game ; it is uncommon to see it twice . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Brown and Page , who play so passionately , so smartly . No one deserves more credit for Pitt 's resurgence than these seniors , whose all-around brilliance makes them one of the most valuable wing duos around . To understand the little things Page and Brown do , go back to the game tape . In that UConn game-a game in which the Panthers outworked , outplayed and , of course , outscored the Huskies-Dixon counts at least six times when Page hit the floor going after loose balls . " Just by getting his hands on those ball , " Brown says , " that helps lead to a bucket . I consider the points we score off those plays to be scored by Julius . " Brown 's hustle in breaking up a Huskies fast break sends Dixon scurrying to his memory bank . He remembers a preseason practice where Brown chased down a teammate and stripped him of the ball when it appeared a breakaway dunk was imminent . " I told our video guy to save that ( practice ) clip , " Dixon says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that play and this one to remind them what can happen when you hustle . " When comtemplating life after Page and Brown , Taft already gets wistful . " Even through great recruiting , I do n't think you can fully replace what Jaron and Julius mean to this team . " That is next year 's problem . " We have to make things happen now , " says Page . " We 've been to Big East championship games . We 've been to the Sweet 16 twice . I hate to say it , but anything less than the Final Four is a failure . Anything else , we 've done that already . " Statements like that can make a coach cringe , especially one who has coached more games against the EA Sports All-Stars ( one ) than in the NCAA Tournament . Instead , Dixon smiles and says , " I guess we 're not supposed to talk about it , but when you have the record that we do , people are going to ask about going to the Final Four . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also had to field those questions . This year , it looks like they have better answers . // Taft stuck with the Panthers after coach Rowland left , and the center 's scoring , rebounding and shot blocking have elevated Pitt . Sidebar Old-school values Pitt 's success is rooted in tightly held beliefs that there is a right way to play , and if proper attention is paid to specific areas , then wins will follow . During the last three years , the Panthers have lost the fewest games ( 13 , one fewer than Duke ) , so there obviously is something to their philosophy . This season , Pitt ranks in the top 5 percent nationally in virtually every statistical category it deems most important .
