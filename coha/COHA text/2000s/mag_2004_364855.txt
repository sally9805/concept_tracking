The growing role of RELIGION in presidential politics was examined in a 1995 cover on the Christian Coalition 's Ralph Reed , now a regional chairman of the Bush-Cheney campaign . <P> Not long ago , America 's Christian right was dismissed as a group of pasty-faced zealots , led by divisive televangelists like Jerry Falwell , who helped yank the Republican Party so far to the right that moderates were frightened away . But Ralph Reed has emerged as the movement 's fresh face ... His message , emphasizing such broadly appealing themes as support for tax cuts , has helped make the Christian Coalition one of the most powerful grass-roots organizations in American politics . Its 1.6 million active supporters and $25 million annual budget ... hold a virtual veto on the Republican nominee for President , and will exert an extraordinary influence over who will occupy the Oval Office beginning in 1997 . In fact , Reed 's success represents the most thorough penetration of the secular world of American politics by an essentially religious organization in this century . <P>  --  Time , May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
