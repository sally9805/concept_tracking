The Ocean Above Us // // Nearly four hundred years ago , in a patchwork of individual fiefdoms that we now call Italy , a revolution of ideas was struggling to take place . The traditional way to understand the workings of the world  --  through a combination of divine revelation and abstract reasoning  --  had begun to come under attack from a new breed . These people called themselves " natural philosophers , " because the word " scientist " had not yet been invented . To find out the way the world worked , they didn ? t sit around and talk about it . They went out and looked . This was not an approach that was likely to find favor with the Church , home of received wisdom , or with its instruments  --  the whispering Inquisitors , with their hotline back to Rome . Now , a certain natural philosopher had fallen very foul of those Inquisitors and been forced to stop his investigations into the structure of the heavens . His name was Galileo Galilei , and our story begins with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , 1633 // // I , Galileo Galilei , son of the late Vincenzo Galilei , Florentine , aged seventy years , arraigned personally before this tribunal , and kneeling before you , most Eminent and Reverend Lord Cardinals , Inquisitors general against heretical depravity throughout the whole Christian Republic . . . have been pronounced by the Holy Office to be vehemently suspected of heresy , that is to say , of having held and believed that the sun is the center of the world and immovable , and that the earth is not the center and moves : // Therefore , desiring to remove from the minds of your Eminences , and of all faithful Christians , this strong suspicion , reasonably conceived against me , with sincere heart and unfeigned faith I abjure , curse , and detest the aforesaid errors and heresies . . . and I swear that in the future I will never again say or assert , verbally or in writing , anything that might furnish occasion for a similar suspicion regarding me. // // As the great Galileo rose from his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recantation , he is said to have muttered " Eppur si muove ! " ( " And yet it moves ! " ) . He knew in his heart that Earth moves around the sun , in spite of what the Inquisitors had made him say . Still , devoutly religious as he was , he had no taste for defying his own church . Nor had he any desire to share the fate of the unfortunate monk Giordano Bruno , who a few decades earlier had been publicly burned for holding similar views . Galileo may have been the most famous philosopher in all Italy , but he knew that in itself wouldn ? t save him from the fire . And though he was now seventy years old , frail , and steadily losing his sight , he was not yet ready to die . He had damaged his eyes by staring through a telescope at wonders he himself had discovered : blemishes that appeared periodically on the surface of the sun ; craters on the moon ; distant but distinct moons circling the planet Jupiter ( who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ? ) , and stars that nobody knew existed . Now , before the cataracts and glaucoma finally clouded his sight , in secret , if necessary , he had one last task to complete . Galileo had seen this " trial " coming ; he ? d known for some time that he couldn ? t continue his study of the heavens . So for some years he had been discreetly changing tack , turning his attention inwards to Earth itself . And , failing eyesight notwithstanding , he was about to change the way we see the most apparently ordinary substance in the world : air . // The Inquisitors knew nothing of this . They were satisfied with his recantation , and decided , graciously , to spare his life . He would be allowed to return to his villa at Arcetri in Florence , though he should understand that he was still considered dangerous and would therefore be held under house arrest . There would be no visitors , save those given prior permission by the Church . Meanwhile , Galileo himself was to spend his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his immortal soul . // Galileo returned to his villa as instructed and performed his penance diligently . But the Inquisitors had also obliged him to swear never again to publish work that might offend the Holy Office , and he had no intention of complying . For with him to Arcetri he had taken a certain manuscript that was already nearly finished . // He had started the experiments it described while awaiting his summons to Rome . Having turned away from his telescope , Galileo had become fascinated instead by the different ways that objects move through the air . The result was to become his masterpiece . The manuscript already recounted findings that would become just as famous as the moons of Jupiter . For instance , Galileo had made the surprising discovery that Earth ? s gravity doesn ? t care in the least how much something weighs . Drop a cannonball and a pebble from a high tower , and both will reach the ground at exactly the same moment . // But within its pages was another discovery that would prove to be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of air . // This might seem like a bizarre notion . How can something so insubstantial as the air weigh anything at all ? In fact our planet ? s air is constantly pushing down on us with great force . We don ? t notice this because we ? re used to it , like lobsters sauntering along on the seafloor , unaware of the crushing weight of the ocean of water above them . We give our own overlying air-ocean so little respect that we even describe anything that ? s full of air as being " empty . " // Back in Galileo ? s time , notions about air were similarly hazy . Most people accepted the idea put forward by Aristotle in the fourth century b.c. that everything in the world was made up of four elements : earth , air , fire , and water . Earth and water were obviously pulled downward by gravity . Fire was obviously weightless . But air was the problem child . Was it heavy enough to be dragged to the ground , light enough to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s gravitational tug and hover ? // Galileo believed that air is heavy and had set about testing his idea . The experiments he performed were typically ingenious . First , he took a large glass bottle with a narrow neck and a tight leather stopper . Into this stopper he inserted a syringe attached to a bellows and by working vigorously managed to squeeze two or three times more air into the bottle than it had previously contained . Next , he weighed the glass bottle most precisely , adding and subtracting the finest of sand to his scales until he was satisfied with the answer . Then , he opened a valve in the lid . Immediately , the compressed air rushed out of its confinement , and the bottle was suddenly a handful of grains lighter . The air that had escaped must account for the missing weight . // This showed that air is not the insubstantial body we usually take it for . But now Galileo wanted to know how much air corresponded to how many grains of sand . For that he would somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its volume . // This time , he took the same glass bottle with its long , narrow neck . However , instead of pumping it full of extra air , he forced in some water . When the bottle was three-quarters full of water , its original air was squeezed uncomfortably into a quarter of its original space . Galileo weighed the bottle accurately , opened the valve , allowed this pressurized air to escape , and then weighed the bottle again to find out how much air he had lost . As for the volume , Galileo reasoned that the portion of air that had been forced to leave the bottle had been pushed aside by the water he had squeezed in , so the volume of air that had fled must be exactly the same as the volume of water that remained . All he had to do was pour out the water and measure its volume and voil ? , he had found the weight for a given volume of air . // The value Galileo came up with was surprisingly large : Air seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent amount of water . If that doesn ? t sound like much , consider this . Picture a particular volume of air for a moment  --  such as the " empty " space inside Carnegie Hall in New York . How heavy would you expect that amount of air to be ? Would it weigh ten pounds ? Or a hundred ? Or maybe even five hundred ? // The answer is somewhere in the region of seventy thousand pounds . // The weight of air is so extreme that even Galileo didn ? t see the whole story . He never considered the question of how we can shoulder such a crushing , overwhelming burden , for the simple reason that he didn ? t realize the air above us is still heavy . He had measured the weight of air in his bottle , but he was convinced that the moment this air was released back into its natural element , the sky , it immediately ceased to weigh anything at all . // Galileo believed that our atmosphere as a whole is incapable of pushing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong . // In spite of the Church ? s opposition Galileo finished his manuscript  --  and published it . After fruitless efforts to convince publishers in Florence , Rome , and Venice to defy the Inquisitors , Galileo finally smuggled the manuscript out to a printer in the Netherlands . Four years later , as he approached the end of his life , a few copies began filtering back to Italy . Each bore a disingenuous disclaimer by Galileo himself , who wrote how astonished he was that his words had somehow found their way to a printer ? s in spite of his obedience to the Papal diktat. // And although Galileo was wrong about the way our air behaves aloft , the experiments his great work contained would influence two very different people to discover the truth .
