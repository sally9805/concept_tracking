I fear salespeople . They are cooler and better-looking and more confident than I am , and they say " Hi " as soon as I walk into their clothing store , a " Hi " that clearly means , " I do n't remember inviting you , and if I had , I think I would have told you to wear something else . " This is obviously all part of some sales technique that assumes that I believe I can one day have sex with the salespeople if I buy the right clothes . I am smarter than that . <P> But I have always suspected that the sales force at top-end clothing stores acts this way because the customers are even more obnoxious . That the customers , deep down , want to be treated like this , to be made to feel they are in the company of attitudinal equals . This is based on hours of sitting around clothing stores and staring at really hot women trying on boots , sometimes while waiting for my wife and sometimes just because I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curt and dismissive . Which only makes them hotter . <P> To test this thesis , I persuaded Stella McCartney , fashion designer and daughter of Sir Paul McCartney , to let me work as a salesperson in her Manhattan store for a day . I chose Stella for several reasons , most of which have to do with the fact that I live a quarter-mile from her store . But apparently Stella has really nice clothes , nearly all of which cost more than $40 , my official price ceiling for any article of clothing . <P> I arrived for work at noon on a Thursday , which I liked since it was a full hour later than I usually arrive at TIME . I was taken into the back room , where there were racks of clothes , stacks of invoices and , surprisingly , a box of Yankee Doodles on top of the microwave . I was handed a five-page booklet on the brand philosophy , which is " paradox . " Nowhere in the five pages does it mention that trying to sell clothes while being mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . <P> Within moments I learned a couple of key things . One was that your first day is no time to take over the sound system . Retail director Brendan Wittlinger keeps a tight rein on the stack of CDs , none of which were by the Beatles , Wings or even Band Aid . Basically , Brendan 's style is to play that Missy Elliott album again and again until I want to kill him . I also learned that I was a little off when I decided to wear a suit and tie . <P> I tried to pump myself up for a sale , which I figured required knowing where the cash register was . It turns out nice stores do n't have cash registers ; they just take your credit card . They also do n't have sale signs , although in this case there was a 60%-off sale on almost everything in the store . We just told people when they came in . The thing was , almost nobody was coming in . <P> My three fellow salespeople were shockingly cool . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes to Kyra Sedgwick and Jessica Seinfeld 's stylist . Also that day , one salesperson , after seeing a woman mistakenly try on a skirt as a tube top , sold it to her that way . It takes some ingenuity to sell clothes . I 'm told that if you act a little bit gay , women will let you see them naked in the dressing room . I 'd be very good at that part of the job .
