<p> The system of private contractors policing the $250 billion-a-year Medicare program is riddled with conflicts of interest , financial disincentives and regulatory breakdowns so severe that fraud and abuse bleed tens of billions of dollars from the program every year . <p> Several of the most egregious frauds have involved the watchdogs themselves  --  private insurance companies the government hires to examine and pay Medicare claims  --  court records show . <p> But even reputable companies lack incentive to search for fraud . They serve at the behest of medical trade groups and , in some cases , are business partners with doctors and hospitals . They skimp on oversight , checking for the proper completion of claims forms but rarely for deceit . <p> The result is a variety of billing scams involving nonexistent patients , unnecessary treatments , phony tests , excessive charges , services never rendered or procedures billed more than once . <p> " It is utterly ridiculous , " says Malcolm Sparrow , a health care fraud expert at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government . " We are trusting insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are riddled with corruption themselves . " <p> Sparrow estimates Medicare fraud at $50 billion to $75 billion a year  --  about twice the amount of Congress ' most expensive proposal for helping senior citizens buy prescription drugs . <p> Fraud is so costly that it has helped force Medicare into drastic spending limits since 1997 . Last year , the program cut doctors ' reimbursement rates 5.4 percent , with an additional 12 percent reduction scheduled for the next three years . Lower rates have led many medical providers to drop Medicare patients , leaving millions of Americans without sufficient health care coverage . <p> The system 's failures emerged with disturbing clarity Oct. 30 , when FBI agents seized records involving two heart specialists suspected of billing Medicare for unnecessary procedures at Redding Medical Center . <p> Several days later , the medical center 's owner , Tenet Healthcare Corp. , announced that a private watchdog  --  Mutual of Omaha  --  had persuaded the federal Department of Health and Human Services to investigate the company for extracting billions of dollars in possible overcharges through a Medicare loophole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But other Medicare scams are so brazen that critics say even cursory oversight would reveal wrongdoing . <p> From 1991 through 1997 , Healthcare One , a medical equipment seller in Encinitas ( San Diego County ) , persuaded more than 110 elderly cancer patients to order special pumps for draining excess lymph fluid . Though the pumps did n't meet federal standards , the company forged doctors ' letters to certify that the patients could not survive without them . <p> Failing to check the paperwork , the Medicare watchdog reimbursed the company $5,400 for each pump , a total of more than $500,000 in public funds for bogus medical equipment . <p> " They jeopardized patients ' lives in the name of the almighty buck , " says Ray Pettersen , Healthcare One 's former national sales manager . " And they were n't ripping off the government , but you and me and every other taxpayer . " <p> CONFLICTS OF INTEREST <p> Medicare 's persistent breakdowns derive in part from its size . The program , created in 1965 to guarantee health care coverage for Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 million Americans last year and paid about a billion claims . <p> But critics say the system 's fraud problems stem from a compromise Congress struck with the health care establishment 38 years ago . Fearing socialized medicine , doctors and hospital owners agreed to participate in the program only after being allowed to select the insurance companies that process the claims and serve as the program 's watchdogs . <p> Today , 49 private insurance companies work for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the federal agency that runs Medicare . <p> The insurance companies receive bills from doctors and hospitals that treat Medicare patients , examine the bills for mistakes and then pay them with checks drawn on two federal trust funds . The trust funds are financed through payroll taxes , patient premiums and general tax revenues . <p> The government reimburses the companies for their costs of processing claims , and grants them a fixed budget for administrative tasks such as controlling fraud and abuse . <p> Typically , the U.S. government awards contracts through competitive bidding . But the compromise with Congress allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to decide which insurance companies should handle hospitals ' Medicare bills . <p> Virtually all the companies turned out to be members of the National Association of Blue Shield Plans , now the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , a frequent political ally of the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association . <p> " ' No sooner had the ink dried on that compromise than we began . . . to have horror stories , " says Richard Kusserow , inspector general in the Department of Health and Human Services from 1982-1991 . For every abuse the government tried to stop , says Kusserow , three would appear in its place . <p> Bilking Medicare became so lucrative that professional criminals got involved . In 1993 , Gabriel Hernandez , a former " logistics coordinator " for the Medellin , Colombia , cocaine cartel , opened a chain of Florida health clinics that billed Medicare and state Medicaid programs for fictitious patients with phony ailments . Over two years , he received checks for more than $1.7 million . <p> " Everything was easy compared with being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was doing was picking up checks every week . And I got caught , but I did n't get killed . " <p> Hernandez was convicted in April 1997 of racketeering and spent five years in prison . <p> Three years ago , the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) cited " fundamental " conflicts of interest as a factor in the watchdogs ' poor performance . <p> Hospitals and doctors not only help select their overseers , they go into business with them . Many of these companies also run health maintenance organizations . The HMOs funnel business to hospitals and doctors that the insurers may regulate . <p> Some of the companies even own hospitals . For example , one subsidiary of Cigna Corp . reviews and pays Medicare claims for doctors . Another subsidiary owns Lovelace Health Systems , a hospital and physician group in Albuquerque , N.M . Last month , . Lovelace agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a whistle-blower suit charging that the company had submitted tens of millions of dollars in false claims to Medicare over 10 years . Cigna did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurer and Medicare cover the same patient , the insurer is primarily responsible for paying the patient 's claims , with Medicare picking up anything left over . But some insurers exploit their Medicare roles by making Medicare the primary payer , a violation that has cost the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , Transamerica , Travelers and other insurers more than $100 million in legal settlements . <p> " Government contractors policing themselves , " says Kusserow , " is not a very healthy situation to have . " <p> CORPORATE ABUSE OF SYSTEM <p> Dozens of these companies have been investigated for abusing the Medicare system , and at least 10 have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in civil penalties and criminal fines : In July , Blue Cross of California , the company that examined and paid Medicare bills for Northern California hospitals until 2000 , agreed to a $9.25 million settlement of charges that it lied to Medicare officials for 10 years about fully auditing claims it had reviewed only superficially . The company admitted no wrongdoing . In 1997 , Blue Shield of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , settled for $12 million charges that it cheated during Medicare audits and submitted false claims to the program . One supervisor allegedly told an employee to hide a $465,000 overpayment . In 1996 , the company paid a $1.5 million fine and pleaded guilty to three felony counts of obstructing a federal audit and destroying documents . In 1998 , Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois pleaded guilty to eight felony counts  --  and paid $4 million in criminal fines and $140 million in civil settlements  --  for fabricating documents , manipulating claims samples and otherwise lying to the government about its poor claims-processing performance . In 1993 , when it discovered that 10,000 claims had been in its mail room for three months , it simply threw them out , according to the government 's lawsuit . The company left the Medicare program in 1998 . <p> Prompted in part by a 15 percent to 20 percent cut of whatever the government recovers , whistle-blowers have brought these and an increasing number of cases like them to the public 's attention . <p> " It 's clear that whistle-blowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco attorney and former prosecutor who specializes in whistle-blower claims . <p> FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVES <p> A major obstacle to effective oversight , say many experts , is the lack of financial incentives to scrutinize claims . <p> Medicare puts private insurers on a fixed budget to compensate them for the costs of handling claims . The incentive is to process the claims as cheaply as possible . <p> " We try to do a good job , " says an executive responsible for reviewing doctors ' claims in California , " but we do n't get extra money for doing a good job . " <p> In their private insurance businesses , companies typically spend more than 8 percent of the total cost of paying claims on the review process , the GAO said . But in a 1998 report , the GAO found that 41 companies spent only .007 percent of their cost of handling Medicare bills on ferreting out fraud and abuse . <p> " There just is n't a whole lot invested in reviewing ( Medicare ) claims , " says William Scanlon , managing director of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of his book on health care fraud , " License to Steal , " Sparrow says he posed to several contractors a hypothetical scam : A doctor submits a $1,500 Medicare claim . The insurer pays the claim and thus confirms that the bill was coded correctly . The doctor then submits identical but false claims on the same day for 10,000 other patients . <p> Virtually every contractor conceded that the scam would work , says Sparrow , and the doctor " would most likely get his or her $15 million check at the end of the week . " <p> A vice president at one contractor told him that the company " probably would n't even notice . It 's not our money . " <p> The private insurance companies say they perform as best they can within the system 's financial constraints . They stress that the huge volume of claims they process would make detailed investigations for fraud prohibitively expensive and time consuming . <p> " In California , we process over 60 million claims a year , " explains Dr. Charlotte Yeh , a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We handle over 96,000 providers in California and 3.8 million ( Medicare ) beneficiaries . . . We do well , but not everything will be perfect . " <p> The review and payment system of insurance watchdogs is almost entirely automatic . Software catches billing errors with checklists developed by Medicare and each private insurer . The software will flag , for example , a claim for a hysterectomy performed on a man . But it can not tell whether a procedure was actually performed  --  or whether a patient even existed . <p> Company employees review about 2 percent of the claims , says Scanlon , but normally confine their review to supporting documents , which themselves can be fabricated . <p> The upshot , says Sparrow , is an oversight system almost oblivious to fraud . <p> In the case involving the two Redding heart specialists suspected of performing unnecessary procedures , Medicare had hired National Heritage to review their bills and those of other doctors in Northern California . But the company did n't report the problem . A whistle-blower did . The company almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Our job is . . . to try and make sure that claims payment goes smoothly and providers get paid in time , " she said . <p> Still , the federal Department of Health and Human Services touts its record as a fraud buster . Since 1996 , the agency has issued annual estimates of " improper Medicare payments . " The totals have dropped from $23.2 billion  --  or 14 percent of all Medicare payments  --  in 1996 to $12.1 billion , or 6.3 percent , in 2001 . <p> The estimates , though , do not include most fraudulent claims , the GAO reported in July 2000 . <p> So how much fraud is there in Medicare ? <p> " Nobody knows , " says Sparrow . " But I ca n't imagine that it would be less than 20 percent , and it 's more likely to be 30 ( percent ) or 35 percent " of annual payments . <p> REGULATORY BREAKDOWNS <p> Responsibility for the Medicare system is dispersed across 10 regional offices that critics say treat private insurers inconsistently . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to review , when to review it and how to punish substandard insurers , according to the GAO . The agents rely heavily on the companies to evaluate their own performances , a system proven ineffective by recent false-claims cases against companies . <p> When agents do visit , they give notice , according to the GAO . A recent government lawsuit charged that , in preparation for a government audit , Blue Shield of California deleted references to auto accident injuries for which the insurer rather than Medicare should have paid . <p> " The superficiality of these reviews is difficult to understand , " wrote the GAO in a recent report , " in light of the large number of contractors that have been found to have . . . integrity problems . " <p> In 1996 , Congress attempted to crack down on Medicare abuses by providing more money and prosecutors and by giving the system authority to hire outside companies as claims investigators . <p> Three years later , Medicare administrators selected 12 such companies through competitive bidding . But rather than independent watchdogs , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving as Medicare watchdogs , or companies related to them . <p> Tim Hill , the director of program integrity at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , acknowledges that " we took awhile to figure out how to use " the new companies . But since early last year , he says , they have been assuming an essential role in rooting out Medicare abuses . <p> Now , when a private insurer suspects fraud , it refers the case to one of the new companies for investigation . The new companies can also unearth fraud themselves by reviewing claims data from all 49 private insurers , detecting suspicious patterns that individual insurers could easily miss . <p> " ( The new companies ) have analytic abilities that enable them to identify areas of abuse that we have n't been able to find before , " said Hill . <p> Still , a 37-year head start for health care scam artists has given government officials a lot of ground to make up . <p> " I admire them for facing up to the problem , but any claims that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sparrow .
