I was wet , smelling of chlorine . It was July 12 , 2003 , in Washington , a beautiful summer day , and I had just come back from swimming . All morning I had been trying to reach I. Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby for a cover story about both President George W. Bush 's claim that Iraq had sought uranium in Africa and former Ambassador Joseph Wilson 's controversial Op-Ed . I had been invited to a fancy Washington country club by friends . Since the club did n't allow the use of cell phones , I kept running from pool to parking lot to try to reach Libby , who was traveling to Norfolk , Va. , with Vice President Dick Cheney for the commissioning of the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan . Eventually I raced home without showering in order to take Libby 's call . When he finally reached me at around 3 p.m. , we spoke for a few minutes as I sprawled on my bed . I had no idea that that brief phone call , along with a conversation with Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a federal investigation for more than two years and that Libby would end up facing a five-count indictment . I doubt it occurred to Libby either . That afternoon , we talked a bit on background and off the record , and he gave me an on-the-record quote distancing Cheney from Wilson 's fact-finding trip to Africa for the CIA . In fact , he was so eager to distance his boss from Wilson that a few days later , he called to rebuke me for not having used the whole quote in the piece . We updated the online version of the story , and I went on to co-author a piece for
