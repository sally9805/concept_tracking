Michael Libling is not to be confused with A. J. Liebling ( take note , Harlan Ellison ) . He is , however , happy to be known as a former student of Mordecai Richler , as well as being known as a master of trivia , a Montreal radio personality , and a distinguished product tester for www.patsypie.com . He 's also well-known for his short stories , many of which have appeared in our pages , including " Timmy Gobel 's Bug Jar " and " Christmas in the Catskills . " And soon he will be known as the author of this sly story . Many of our early readers ( believe it or not ) said this story was their favorite of the three takes on Lady Luck . <p> GAYLE IS PUTTERING ABOUT in the kitchen when Denny wriggles under their bed to wait . He listens , speculates on the nature of each clink and clack and clatter . Wonders if she might be searching for the carving knife he now holds flat across his chest . One of her prized Tramontinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Water runs . It has been a long while since Denny has hidden under a bed . Thirty years , at least . Escaping his father and his belt , his mother and her episodes . Playing games of hide " n " seek , with friends who rarely sought . Coffee gurgles . A fresh pot . And she 's humming now . That Faith Hill song , what 's it called - the one she sings with what's-his-name ? A year ago , no chance he would have fit under any bed . Then he got lucky . Caught some bug on a pepperoni and bacon from Twofer Pizza . Took him months to shake it . Was n't the best diet he might have come up with , but it sure did the trick . Heck , Twofers gave him the idea in the first place . Two with one blow . So far , his plan has gone off without a hitch . He left home before sunup , made sure to rouse Gayle from her sleep , erasing any doubts he was really gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month long he had reminded her his flight would be leaving at seven . " Goddammit , Denny , how many times do you need to tell me ? Shut up , already . " Truth is , he does n't need to be at the airport till four . McCreedy , the prick , he does n't so much as knock . Marches right in like he owns the place , which he does , of course . Least he could have done was give them a break on the rent , considering what Gayle 's been slipping him on the side . Their talk is small . And Gayle , well , she 's got this funny , weird laugh Denny has never heard before . Like she 's gagging on a canary . Makes him want to crawl under the carpet , never mind the bed . Mugs on countertop . Toaster pops . Coffee poured . Toast buttered . Spoons in jelly jar . Spoons in sugar bowl . Half-and-half dribbled . Coffee stirred . Virginia Slims lit . And Denny just about cracks up out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every pound he lost , she must have tacked on two . And just like that , they 're in the bedroom , on the bed , and going at it not two feet above him . The big brass bed Gayle 's grandma left her . Noisiest bed in the universe . Only thing Denny could never fault was the bounce . Nothing like the old springs . McCreedy 's loafers drop to the floor-shiny new pennies in each , for Christ 's sake . Then Gayle 's slippers . Her nightie , the Wal-Mart pink . And McCreedy 's boxers , Old Navy . The mattress grazes Denny 's nose , his chin . He shuts his eyes , as if to block out her horny , nutzoid histrionics . You 'd think she was giving birth to a chainsaw or something . And McCreedy , well , he 's no slouch in the ecstasy department either . Loudest Denny 's ever heard a guy in the sack , in fact . Then again , Denny has only ever heard himself-the strong silent type , faithful to his fantasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you dead up there ? Hello , are you dead ? " They flame out in unison . Finally . Whatever this guy 's got going for him , Denny does n't want to think about it . He 's ready for his twofer . McCreedy lies spent on Gayle or she on him . It makes no difference , though from the broad sag of the mattress , Denny figures the bottom butt belongs to his loving girlfriend and longtime fiance . Okay , so maybe stalling her on the wedding date for seven years was n't the fairest on his part , still , getting married was n't his idea in the first place . And then she goes out and cheats on him ? McCrecdy , he 's only the latest . Denny brings the knife to his side , grips it by his hip , point up . Shuts his eyes again . Breathes slow , deep . Summons all reserves of malice from his heart . And steers the blade up . In Vegas , Denny expects an accolade or two for the weight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's with the bandage . Denny does n't mind . At least it distracts from the crack in his glasses . Right lens . Better yet , they 're talking to him . At past conferences , he 's been pretty much invisible . " Jeez , Flett , " Mayweather says . " What happened ? You look like a Doberman just had its ears cropped . " " Shaving , " Denny tells him . " Jeez , man , you shave your ears ? " Garner , newly appointed National Sales Manager , suggests he balance the look by taping his good ear too . All the boys crack up . Like it 's the funniest thing the sucks have heard in all their lives . Then Garner ups the ante . Makes like he 's waltzing with a microphone , uncorks this dumb , cartoony voice : " Paging Mr. Spock . Paging Mr. Spock . Your pointy ear has been found . Your pointy ear has been found .... " - well , it was like the hilarity would never end . Talk about lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would be enough to save him . No amount of kissing-up would have been . Denny had missed budget nine quarters in a row . Nine , count " em , nine ! And though his numbers had come up short before , plenty of times , nobody had said so much as boo . Of course , that was in the days before the merger , before Garner , when Old Man Lieberman ran the show . Even so , was n't a guy entitled to a bad run now and then ? Did n't loyalty mean anything ? And look at the territory for Christ 's sake , Bismarck to Winnipeg . Had n't he volunteered to take it on for the good of the company , when nobody else would ? Did n't eleven years mean anything ? Eleven years , Jesus .... What did they expect ? All that competition from China . The pressure from the big box stores . That was the trouble . Nothing meant nothing anymore . Not country . Not people . Not family . Nothing but the bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your benefits - your triple-stitch seams or your patented LokTuk corners or the unfailing sincerity of your handshake . Hell , the Johnnie Walker Black he 'd send to the sales and marketing boys each Christmas might as well have been jars of moonshine for all the business it threw his way . Nope . Not when they could land the same quality for a good sight less from overseas . Damn sure was n't Denny 's fault . " Ours are American-made , " he 'd tell them . But mattress pads just did n't register all that high on the flag-waving scale of things . Garner drops the bomb . Hatchet cool in his Brooks Brothers pinstripe . Hair pomaded to a thick plastic sludge . Diamond stud in his left lobe trading glitter with the hotel 's famed galaxy of crystal overhead . He catches up to Denny by the elevators , on the Saturday night , not five minutes after the closing banquet . Gets right to it , despite the grenades of joy exploding around them , congratulations and back-slapping and laughter zinging about like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're letting you go , Flett . " " Go where ? " Denny 's head swells with optimism . Maybe they 're finally sending him south , giving him a shot at Teddy Garcia 's territory . Not that he did n't feel bad for ol " Teddy G. Still , one man 's stroke , another man 's stroke of good fortune . Garner blocks the door , keeps the others at bay on the mezzanine . Mayweather . Dubroff . Reich . Montello . Koltai . " Need some privacy here , boys , " he says with a wink , and it dawns on Denny he may be the only one who does n't know what 's going down . " Better off alone right now , eh , you and me ? " Garner says , eyebrow cocked in what may be empathy . But they are hardly alone . Somehow . Incredibly . Gamer has failed to notice the woman pressed into the corner behind him . She 's slight , but not that slight . And Denny , he sees her just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lipstick artfully in hand . Lips red , redder , redder .... Fingernails a glossy match , manicured just short of lethal . And , thank the Lord , no ring on any finger . He ca n't take his eyes off her , in fact . And watching her , well , he can only hope she 'll be touching up her face for a nice long while before she glances up . Not only because he knows a guy like him would n't stand a chance with a woman like her , but because he 'll be forced to look away , make like he was n't staring at all . Garner taps 44 . Does n't bother to ask Denny for his floor and Denny does n't think to volunteer it . " Business is n't what it used to be , Flett . Companies like ours , we ca n't afford to carry the dead weight anymore . " She just might be the most beautiful woman Penny 's ever seen , outside a Victoria 's Secret catalog . And that means a lot , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's more than beautiful , so much so , he regrets not having been more diligent in reading Gayle 's old Reader 's Digests , especially the It Pays to Increase Your Word Power pages , because he knows there 's got to be better adjectives to do her justice than beautiful alone . " We need to cut out the fat , Flett , if you catch my drift . " Her hair is a cautious red , cut Cleopatra style , long , shiny and straight , a veil of bangs to eyes . Her brown , brown eyes . " Frankly , Flett , you should 've been axed years ago . Not once , man , I 'm telling you - not once have you earned a penny above your draw . Unbelievable . Not one red cent . What have you been doing - sleepwalking ? The buyers , they tell me , it 's like you do n't know a damn thing about bedding . " Her dress is black , yet shimmers silver , even in the ratty light of the elevator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugs Denny 's lapel , stashes an envelope in the inside pocket . " A fair package by any standard . One week for every year , plus vacation . Man , I could n't believe you 've never taken a vacation . " She caps the lipstick and Denny drops his gaze , but not so quick as to miss her smile . Warm . Amused . Charitable . Like it 's not the first time she 's caught some desperado ogling . Like she 's not put off by him in the slightest . And he knows it 's nuts to even think it , but he 's wondering if maybe she 's not one of those love-at-first-sight deals ; he can feel it in his chest , the stop " n " go of his heart . Knows she 'll be good for him . Convinced she 'll see the worth in him . Or , could be , Denny is just having a coronary . " The team and me , we 're meeting for drinks up in the Moonglow now . Great view of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tonight , eh ? The boys , they 're pretty pumped and it 'd be a shame to have you bring them down . Save your good-byes for the getaway breakfast , okay , sport ? And if you do n't mind me telling you , I 'd get that crack in your glasses fixed real soon . Makes you look like one of those mental defectives . " As they pass 39 , she snaps her compact shut , giving Gamer quite the start . She reaches past him and you 'd think a ninja assassin had dropped in to do battle with the National Sales Manager of the Calabash Bedding Company . The guy reels on his heels , his head and shoulders hit the wall , and his hands fly up to protect his face . But all she does is tap the panel at 41 , and Garner , red-faced , scrambles to recover his cool . " Well , hello , gorgeous . Where have you been all my life ? " She segues from purr to mild giggle , as if charmed by Garner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased a little too , Denny examines the scuff marks on the toes of his shoes , then stiffens . Her hand is on his back . He holds his breath , swallows , as she touches his shoulder , the nape of his neck , his cheek - the smooth tips of her fingernails grazing the comer of his mouth . And for the briefest of moments she looks him in the eye , her red lips parted in prelude to a kiss . And before Denny or Garner can begin to fathom what has transpired , the elevator doors open and shut , and she slips away on 41 . " Oh man , what I would n't give .... Vegas hookers , eh , Flett ? " Not a hooker , Denny thinks . Maybe one of those high-priced escorts , but no hooker , no way . And then a rotten possibility stirs up inside his head , performs a nasty little jig before rebounding to his gut . Why the hell else would she give him any notice-a nothing like him ? Oh , Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The love of his life , she would n't . His hand darts to his pocket . DENNY MAKES HASTE to 41 , desperate to pick up her trail . He 's ready to write the whole thing off as some sort of misunderstanding , as long as she returns his check , that is . He has n't told a soul . Not even Garner . What good is it to her , anyhow , check in his name and all ? Heck , maybe she 'll be so grateful to him for letting her off the hook , she 'll invite him into her room for drinks or something . And would n't that be something ! Sniffs , thinks he 's caught a whiff of her perfume . Listens by a door , not clear on what he 's listening for , short of that purr-giggle thing of hers . Moves on . Dawdles by a few more doors , before taking a break at the refreshment alcove . He 's hoping maybe she 'll get the munchies . He drops a handful of change into the candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack of earplugs shoots the chute . He lunges for the machine as if to kill , then senses someone behind him . It 's a guy cradling an ice bucket . A pudgy linebacker decked out in the hotel 's monogrammed terry bathrobe and , from what Denny can tell , a lacy black bra and stockings with garters too . The guy nods , says , " That 's the trouble with cheap lenses . I once cracked a pair and scratched my cornea . " Denny checks his watch . It 's later than he thought . Decides he 'd better get down to his room . The worst pan will be telling Garner to put a stop on the check . Damn . He was hoping he 'd never have to speak to the prick again . Or maybe , maybe , he 's better off forgetting the whole thing , let her keep the money . Yeah . Could be she needs the cash more than he does . Looking how she does , dressing the way she does , ca n't be cheap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as he tracks her down , he 'll put it right to her . " You can keep the money , " he 'll say . She 's got to see something in him then . How could she not love him then ? Damn door wo n't open . Still , Denny pumps the card into the slot till his wrist gives out . His bum wrist . The wrist he sprained driving the knife into the mattress . He broods all the way to reception , but things start looking up fast . The desk clerk is reprogramming his card when Denny spots her . She 's crossing the lobby , on a beeline for the casino . Black velvet clutch in hand . " Hey ! " He rushes after her , his larynx wound so tight , his shouts peter down to a series of gusty bleats . He hesitates , uneasy about making physical contact , then goes ahead and taps her on the shoulder . Her bare shoulder . He braces for the worst , expects she might threaten him with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be the first time his intentions have been misunderstood . She whirls about , huge smile on shiny pink lips , anxious to see who 's so eager for her attention . " Yes ? " she says , enthusiasm holding , though it 's evident she does n't know who the hell he is . And all he can do is stand there like a dope , because he has n't a clue as to who she is either . And he ca n't for the life of him comprehend how he has confused this bikini blonde for the wondrous redhead from the elevator . Her hair is short , for Christ 's sake , and she 's got to be a good head taller . Younger too . Early twenties , easy . And though she 's plenty pretty , she is not the woman he plans to marry . Not even close . Except maybe for her eyes . There 's something about her brown , brown eyes . Jesus , can love-at-first-sight be habit-forming ? Sheepish comes naturally to Denny Flett . " I ... uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I love the slots , do n't you ? " she says , though it 's not really a question . Denny retrieves his room key . " Your ear is bleeding , " the clerk tells him . The maid has forgotten to make his bed . Again . He could let it pass . He 'll be checking out first thing , before that goddamn getaway breakfast , that 's for sure . Still , it 's a matter of principle . He dials Housekeeping . Starts out well enough , his important businessman voice , but he loses momentum by the end of the first sentence and , by the beginning of third , he 's a fifth grader tattling to teacher . Housekeeping tells him he 's had DO NOT DISTURB hanging from his door since the night he checked in and it 's a good thing he called too , because they were about to send up Tito from security to see if Mr. Flett in 512 was n't the latest guest to exit on a second spritzer or a slash " n " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with what he hears as " No problem , Mr. Flett , " but on reflection registers more precisely as " No problem , dickhead . " He sighs the third or fourth longest sigh of his sorry life . Does n't feel the least bit sleepy . Finds himself by the window , willing to be inspired by the awesome panorama of this city in the desert or to jump , but he can find neither the drawstring nor the guts . Why axe hotel curtains so damn heavy , anyhow ? He probes the bed and bed sheets for the TV remote , comes up with it quicker than expected . Hey . maybe his luck is changing . He clicks at the twenty-seven-incher . Nothing . Clicks rapid-fire until he feels the batteries leaking onto his palm . He hangs his jacket on the bathroom door , confronts himself in the mirror . Shakes his head , groans at the misery groaning back . Sets his glasses on the vanity and the top section of the broken lens drops out . He will never buy prescription glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwraps the pressure bandage from his wrist , relieved it has gone unnoticed , unlike his ear . Should 've worn his dad 's old hunting hat , that 's what he should 've done . The green one with the earflaps . Garner and the boys might 've looked at him freaky , but did n't they already ? Still , they might have let him be . Maybe he 'd still have his job . Denny dries his hands , puts on his broken glasses . He can see down all right , it 's the looking straight ahead that 's become kind of awkward . He reaches for his jacket , but it snags on the hook , drops to the tiles and the envelope sails out . The envelope . He ca n't believe what he sees . But of course ! The jacket . Same suit he 's worn for the last he-doesn't-know-how-many years , it 's got two inside pockets . Two , count " em , two ! Garner , of course , he 'd been facing Denny when he 'd stuffed it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right . How could he have been so stupid not to look ? Denny waltzes into the bedroom , lips all over the envelope , like it 's him and her in full-out foreplay . Heck , he 'd kick up his heels if he had n't pulled a ligament last time he tried the stunt . He taps out the check . Shuts one eye , squints with the other . " Holy freakin " cow . " He whoops headfirst onto the bed . Jesus ! He 's rich . By Denny Flett standards anyhow . It is more money than he has had at one time in his entire life . And in five seconds flat he knows exactly what he 's going to do with it . " And how many more nights will you be with us then , Mr. Flett ? " the desk clerk asks . " As many as it takes , " Denny says , as cool and as slick as he has ever managed to be , despite the broken glasses . So cool and slick , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As many as it takes . " He scouts out the casino , the slots , the tables , before heading out into the night . Denny Flett , he 's got some serious shopping to do . DENNY HAS always had a problem with that **34;2887;TOOLONG malarkey . He 's never been sure whether the rest part means whatever 's left or a good night 's sleep . But watching the sun rise , cresting the mountains with marching band purple and orange , well , he has no doubt it can only be the former . And the sooner he makes it back to the hotel , he figures , the sooner his rest will begin . He fuels up on Starbucks and a cranberry scone and plants himself in the lobby . He knows she 's somewhere in the place , just does n't know why he knows . But when she finally does come down for breakfast or whatever , he will be ready to profess his love . He 's got his lines down pat . No way she 'll be able to refuse him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His spiffy new boots with their patented two-inch InvisiLifts . Not with his puffy new hairstyle , combed to cover both bald spot and wounded ear . Not with his frameless new specs . And not with the gift he 's got for her in his pocket . God , Vegas is Heaven . Anything you want , anytime , day or night . Once , after being held hostage for a summer , baby-sitting a neighbor 's hell-spawn of homicidal ferrets , and receiving not so much as a kick in the ass in return , Denny commenced to compile a list of every stupid thing he had ever done , vowing never to repeat . He gave up at 243 , the exercise too damn depressing . But these are different times and he 's a different man . Look at him , for God 's sake . No way his latest stupid thing could lie dead ahead . Come ten , his patience pays off . She emerges from behind a flotilla of carnivorous junket junkies , their rabid eyes in pursuit as she struts to the fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow sandals with heels . He rises , anxious not to appear too anxious . God , she 's lovely , hair curling-iron wavy as it falls about bare shoulders . And the way she moves - a dancer , a showgirl , a ballerina on the lam . Mayweather barrels out of nowhere , snares Denny in the crook of his arm , fist poised in mock noogie . " Jeez , man , how you doin ' ? I heard the news . What a shame . Garner was sure you 'd show for breakfast , but I knew better . I know you , man . I know you . " " I got to go , " Denny says . Mayweather holds on . " It 's been a while since , you and me , we had a heart-to-heart . " Denny has never had a heart-to-heart with anyone , least of all Mayweather . He 's counting on his bride-to-be to fill the lifetime void . " Twenty years back , I was you , Flett . Believe me , I 've been there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did it all . But I 'm telling you , getting downsized , losing my livelihood , nothing worse . " She 's chatting up some biddy who 's glued to a walker , pats the woman 's hand with genuine affection , turns toward the casino . She 's perfect . Beautiful , and fond of old people to boot ! What more could he ask for ? " I 'm not saying it 's the answer for everyone , but I 'm telling you , Flett , Jesus worked wonders for me . " Damn , he 's lost her . " Will you promise me , Flett , you 'll give Him a shot ? " " I have , plenty of times , but He keeps shooting back . " " Hey , nice tie , Flett . Is it new ? And jeez , your suit .... " He breaks Mayweather 's grasp , makes good his escape . His relief is immediate . There 's no missing her white dress . Heck , wo n't surprise him one dam bit if it turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak . She is wending her way down an alley of slots , all smiles and cottoncandy charm . More than anything , he wants to rush up and bare his soul , but he is the new and improved Denny Flett . The slick and cool Denny Flett . He keeps his distance as she goes about her business , though he has no handle on what her business may be . Call girls are n't early risers , are they ? And especially not on Sunday mornings . Tourist would make sense , if she were doing what tourists do . She does n't play the games , only observes , and never in one spot for long . She flutters here and there mostly , more interested in the people than the action . She could be working casino security . Yeah , that would make sense , if she were n't so touchy-feely . At the roulette table , for instance , she 's got a mile of room to pass , yet she cruises in close , hand on some guy 's shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denny 's heard about people like her , sickiee who get their thrills from rubbing up against strangers . But are women into that too ? Unless she 's not a woman . Hell , this is Vegas , after all . Then , too , she could be what he has suspected from the start . Thief . Pickpocket . Only problem , where does she stash her take ? No give in the dress . No handbag or tote . No apparent accomplices . By midafternoon , he has followed her through every square inch of the casino and then some . She shows no sign of letting up . Either he makes his move or he does n't . It 's now or never . He sucks in his gut , meanders ahead just as casual as can be . A chance encounter in a jumble of slots , that 's all it is . He does n't choke , does n't stammer , though his voice crackles on the high side . " Hey , nice to see you again . Remember me ? You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she says , and he needs to look twice before looking for the hidden cameras . Is this a jokel One of those dumb TV prank shows ? Do nobodies get Punk'dl Because he 's standing toe to toe with a leggy brunette who 'd hold her own in the NBA , tank top and Bermudas , pony tail to her waist and Mary Janes on her feet . Hell , she 'd no sooner fit in that White dress than Gayle would . Edginess spikes down on the fringes of his psyche . " What 's going on ? Did you see - ? " " The slots are fun , are n't they ? " she says . " I 'm looking for this lady , this woman ; she was here like two seconds ago . White sundress , a halter top , red hair , about so tall ? " He hesitates , smiles goofy , blushes . " Kind of built too , you know ? " " Everybody loves the slots , " she says , her hand brushing his forearm . Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make an exception in her case , if he were n't already spoken for . Fidelity is important to Denny . And speaking of slots , two , one adjacent the other , are coughing up big time , spilling their precious guts . Bells . Whistles . Sirens . And a light show on the crystal ceiling that 'd make a half-bad rock band seem half-good . Applause and cheering builds in waves as wannabes flock to gawk , eager to get a piece of the lucky winners - a level of joy unbeknownst to Mankind since the Israelites scored manna from Heaven . Denny , he 's left hanging . Does n't know where the NBA chick or his woman in white have got to . Then he glimpses the white dress not thirty feet to the left and he 's hooting along with the rest of the yokels . He 's on her in a flash , gets right to it , wonders aloud if she 'd join him for lunch or maybe later for a drink . " So , you know , we could sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . " And somewhere , midblink , a dewy-eyed waif materializes in her stead , jeans and a T , BRITNEY scripted in blue glitter across budding chest . She punches him playfully on the arm . " The slots are so sweet , " she says , bubbles in her voice . God . she 's cute . Denny 's no Dr. J , but he 's enough on the ball to know it 's bouncing plenty screwy . So this is what a nervous breakdown feels like . She might as well have taken a hammer to his head , the way it 's throbbing . He knows , too , because he once took a hammer to the head on a weekend in D.C. Mugged half a block from Georgetown . Took everything he had , too , the bastards , which was just short of nothing . He should back off , call a timeout , lay claim to a stool at the back of a bar , but if peddling bedding accessories for a quarter of his life has taught him anything , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , of course . A waste , pretty much . He sticks with the chase , and she continues to vaporize on his cue , leaving a series of vacuous , albeit lovely bystanders in her elusive place . Blondes . Brunettes . Dark-haired exotics . Redheads with blonde streaks and blondes with red streaks . Brown-eyed women who ca n't keep their hands off him , poking and prodding and patting and squeezing , while endorsing the merits of slot machines with increasing belligerence . " Why do n't you just play the goddamn slots already , little man . and get the hell on home . " Still , the attention is a pleasant departure from life as he has known it , though the wear and tear has him feeling every inch a slab of sirloin condemned to the tenderizing block . His feet are killing him . Stupid new boots . Since when does he wear boots ? He has n't had a thing to drink or eat since the coffee and scone . And though he wants to carry the chase through to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been on the go pretty much since he crawled out from under Gayle 's bed , and the time has come to pack it in . He 's never had any luck with love . No sense fooling himself any longer his streak would end in Vegas . Denny resigns himself to the exit . He spies her once more , now by a blackjack table , amber drink in hand , straw between lips . She looks right at him and , for an instant , his hope soars , but the expression on her face makes clear her guard is up . He nods his concession , shrugs , and walks the other way . May be the hardest thing he 's ever done , but kind of exciting too . Imagine , Denny Plett pulling a Bogart . He pauses by a dollar slot , jiggles the change in his pocket , and heads across the street to the diner with the $9.99 buffet . You 'd think it was his last meal , the way he attacks the steam tables . He turns the corner from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a stalker , " she says . " I should call the police . " Can too many desserts cause a guy to hallucinated Is she really waiting for him , cooling her heels by his door ? Magnificent heels , too . Stilettos , for God 's sake . He does not approach , fearful she 'll pull her vanishing act , worried he overdid the garlic on his lasagna . She 's back to her Cleopatra number from the night before . Red lips . Red nails . Black dress that shimmers silver . Way too much woman for him . What the hell was he thinking ? " Who are you ? " she wants to know , more a plea than a demand . He inches closer . Takes him four tries before the words are anywhere near intelligible . " Denny - Denny Flett . " " No , not your name . I want to know who you are and why you 're here . " " I 'm no stalker .

" " I kept a little , you know , for food and stuff , but - " She gives the tie a swift jerk and flips it into his face . " And you could n't spare a dollar to play ? A quarter ? " Her hands rest firm upon her hips . " I was hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And well , I-I .... " He pulls the small velvet box from his pocket . " I bought you something . " She glares at the box , at him , stomps off , stomps back , a not unimpressive maneuver considering her four-inch heels . " Open it . " He extends his hand . " Please . " " You ca n't buy me gifts . I do n't want your gifts . You were supposed to play the slots . " " I know it 's kind of sudden . And we hardly know each other . But when something is right , two people , well , they can just feel it . And a lot of good looking women - you see it in People magazine all the time - they go out with not-so-good-looking guys . Remember LyIe Lovett and Julia Roberts ? Claudia Schiffer and that magician guy ? " Denny ca n't believe the voice is his , the lines flowing as rehearsed , the odd stutter notwithstanding . " And last night , I mean , when you touched me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was hoping maybe you 'd marry me . " " What 's the matter with you ? You think I 'm a fairy-tale whore with a bean of gold and you 're the lovable mug who 's going to carry me away from all this ? You think this is a movie ? " " You 're a hooker ? " " For God 's sake , you know damn well who I am . " " Look , if I did something wrong , I 'm sorry . I just thought you liked me . " She squeezes his arm where the bicep should be . Steps back . " Tell me what you see . " " You . I see you . " " No . My hair . My face . My eyes . My hands . Tell me what I look like . " He answers as best he can , falling for her all over again . " You 're so beautiful . " She lays her hand on his cheek . " Tell me again . Tell me what you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , so beautiful . " " And you need a thesaurus . " " But you are . " She musses his hair . " My height . How tall am I ? And my nose , tell me about my nose . My eyebrows . My lips . My chin . " The details do not vary . " And earlier , when I wore the white dress , what did you see ? Me or someone you thought was me ? " " No . You . Of course . I mean , your hair was different .... " " A different color ? " " No . Just done up different . Softer . Wavy . I 'd never mistake you anywhere . " " You 're not supposed to see me the same way twice . Nobody sees me the same way twice . Nobody . " " Sounds like a lot of work . " " Not until you came along . " " Please , take the ring . You do n't have to marry me , honest . Just take it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are you ? C'm on . Really ? You 're hiding something , I 'm certain of it . " He shuffles uncomfortably . " You mean about Gayle ? " " So you 're married ? I should have guessed . " " No . Never . She cheated on me . And then , well , it 's over now . " " You 're a lousy liar . You may . be able to see the real me , but I can most definitely see the real you . " " You know then , about killing her ? " Her grin is smug . " I do now . " " I was going to get them both . Wait till they were finished , you know . But no sooner do I stick the knife in the mattress , it hits a coil or something , and goes off all cockeyed . Gets jammed up smack over my head and I ca n't push it in and I ca n't pull it out . " " As I recall , your former employer mentioned something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I forgot there 'd be coils . But that was n't the worst of it . Cayle and him , well , they start going at it again , like they had n't done it two seconds before . " " Lucky girl . " " And that knife is up there twisting and turning , bobbing this way and that . That 's how I sprained my wrist , trying to pull it out . see , how it 's all swollen here . Then , get this , when they finish up , they go into the shower together , like they have n't had enough of each other already . Plus , they leave the bathroom door wide open . I can see everything . They 're soaping each other up . And they 're singing this Faith Hill song Gayle really loves , and they do n't sound half bad , either . Well , I ca n't stomach any more , I 'm going to be sick , so I turn my head , and a good thing too . Because right then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the glasses and takes off the top of my ear . " He waits for her to stop laughing . " I did n't move till they got the hell out of the house . Took their good sweet time too . " " Let 's face it , Dennis , you lost your nerve , it 's as simple as that . But my oh my , what a masterful loser you are . Indeed , to want to kill your lover in the first place , rather than merely end the relationship on rational terms . And then , to follow through on your desire and to fail so pathetically .... Pure genius . I had you pegged the moment I laid eyes on you . Unfortunately , I underestimated the extent of your folly . " " It 's the way things go for me . I 'm used to it . " " No wonder this has happened ! You ca n't recognize luck even when it stares you in the face . " " I do n't think it ever has . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " He shakes his head . " An actress , is that it ? Have I seen you in something ? If you told me your name maybe .... " She leans against the door of his room , suddenly weary . " Do you mind if we go inside ? My feet are killing me . " " Hey ! Mine , too . " His key fails to open the door . What else is newl She promises to wait while he goes down to have the card reprogrammed . He does n't believe her for a second , so she gives him her clutch as collateral . Alone in the elevator , he peeks inside . The small black purse is empty . " You may well have ruined my life , " she tells him . She sits in the corner of the sofa , small pillow on her lap , a miniature bottle of vodka in hand . Her feet , in sheer black hose , rest upon the coffee table . Her toenails are painted red too . " I ca n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " Denny says . " I did n't mean to do whatever it is I did . " He drags the chair over from the desk . " If I do n't make things right with you , they 'll demote me for sure . Put me back working the 7-Elevens , I 'll bet . Nothing 's worse than lottery tickets . Not even the sulky circuit up north . " " What do you do , exactly ? security ? " " Some might call it that . " " If it 'll help , you can keep the ring . You can see it 's no Cracker Jack junk ; it 's worth a small fortune . But I got no use for it anymore . " She slips the diamond onto her finger , assesses it in the lamplight . " Quite the whopper . Are you always so rash ? " " Only when I eat citrus fruit , " he says , and her reaction represents a milestone in his personal history : A woman has laughed at a Denny Flett joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " but when I saw you in the elevator , I thought it was fate , like everything was going to be all right for me from here on out . " " It should have been . It could have been . If you knew how to take a hint . People do come to Vegas to gamble , you know ? " " You made me feel so good . You see , I 've always had this thing .... I 've never told anyone this . You see , I 'm not scared of dying ; I 'm scared of dying and not leaving anybody behind who cares I 'm gone . I guess that 's what I was hoping for in you , that you 'd be the one to miss me . " " God , bring on the violins . You are truly the ultimate mope . I 'm not sure I can take much more of you . " She pads barefoot to his unmade bed . " How much money do you have ? " " None . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll need a little more . I ca n't give you the money , because then it would n't be yours . It wo n't work otherwise . The money has to be yours . " She scans the room in search of he knows not what , her gaze settling on the diamond on the third finger of her left hand . A liquid smile slinks wittingly across her lips . " But I can buy something from you , ca n't I ? That would not be against the rules . " She plucks a dollar from her velvet clutch . " Here , " she says to him . " Your wish is fulfilled . The ring is mine . " " You can have it for nothing , I told you . I do n't need money where I 'm going . " She folds the dollar into the handkerchief pocket of his new khaki suit . He protests . " Honest . I do n't need it . " " Believe me , you do . " She loosens his tie , unbuttons his shin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , really lucky . " She wakes to find him staring . " Your eyes , " he says , brain struggling to put two and two together . " All those women in the casino yesterday , they had your eyes . " " Yes , they surely did , " she says . " They were friends of yours , were n't they ? They were trying to keep me away from you . " She buries her face in the pillow , exasperation riding the downside of a yawn . " I love you , " he tells her . " Everybody does , " comes her muffled reply . IT 'S A RED DRESS day . Denny has n't a clue as to how she came up with it - he 's seen no suitcase - but he does n't much mind . Black was nice . White was great . But red is her color . She leads him by the hand as they enter the casino and he wishes to hell Gayle and McCreedy were here to see it . Garner , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just bust ! She insists he choose the machine . Her rules , again . The slot sucks up his bill . " If you ask me , it 's going to be nothing but a waste of a good dollar , " he says . " Do n't bet on it , " she advises , and kisses him full on the mouth . She winks . " A little extra insurance . " " God , you 're beautiful , " he says , as he pulls the handle . And he 's thinking she 's even more beautiful when she 's angry . She races ahead of him , all rage and fury , L'Oral and Chanel , muttering about 7-Elevens and lottery tickets and over her dead body . " Everybody wins . Everybody . But you , you .... I do n't know how much of me it 's going to take , I do n't know how long , but you 're not going to get away with this . You 're not going to do this to me . " She pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of losers - more than you can imagine - but never one as unlucky as you . " Denny does n't say a word . Grins maybe a little .
