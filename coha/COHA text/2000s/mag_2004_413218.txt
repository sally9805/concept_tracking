Kids , marriage , friendship , money . The good doctor tackles your toughest problems and helps you get back on track . BY LILY BOSCH // On a tranquil Beverly Hills side street , where palm-draped mansions are the norm , Dr. Phil McGraw 's vast yellow stucco villa is a monument in the making . The self-made self-help tycoon reportedly paid Texas-style cash for the estate-the princely sum of $7.5 million . Now the paparazzi have descended , including one photographer outfitted in head-to-toe camouflage , whom Dr. Phil busted in the bushes . Recently , his house has become a stop for some of the Hollywood tour buses . Sure enough , on a breezy , crystalline morning , as I ring the front bell and wait for the gates to open , a sleek white minivan rolls up and stops in the middle of the street . Cameras flash as I am welcomed into a home that is a rococo haven , teeming with plump silk pillows and velvet upholstery . Design credits belong solely to Robin McGraw , Dr. Phil 's petite brunet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pink Lacoste sweater and junior-size blue jeans . Even as gawkers continue to peer from the street , angling for a glimpse of her ex-linebacker husband , she dismisses the intrusions with genuine good humor . " Sometimes when I see the buses , I come out and wave to them , " she says with a laugh . " I think it 's hilarious . " When Dr. Phil appears , he looks ready to rumble , or at least go for a nice long run . Dressed in a black Nike T-shirt , sweats , and New Balance sneakers , he sinks , down into an oversize sofa-a big man requires big furniturc . Politely turning off his text messaging pager , he fidgets with a bottle of Fiji water , picking at the label while he tells it like it is . By the end of our two-hour talk , the label is completely stripped away . Phil McGraw has made a career out of tearing down the self-absorbed and the self-justifying . His advice has lead to four best-selling books : Life Strategies , Relationship Rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimate Weight Solution . And his take-no-prisoners approach has won him legions of new fans on his hit daytime talk show , Dr. Phil , now in its second season . But McGraw has plenty more to say about the messes we make of our lives . he even has a phrase for it : " 1 call it runnin " it off into the ditch . When you 've just totally gotten off track , you 've run your life into the ditch . " Today , his mission is specific . he wants to pinpoint the ways we screw things up , in six fundamental areas : money , marriage , work , friendship , parenting , and weight . Here , in his own words , is Dr. Phil 's road map to avoid life 's big and little ditches . MONEY " The get-real truth about finances is this : You do n't get into money problems because of money , and you do n't fix money problems with money . People fall into the money pit because of shortsightedness , wrong values , lack of impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of who they are . I guarantee you , if we were to pick somebody out of the phone book who 's in a money crisis and we wrote a check to cover his debt , in six months he 'd most likely be up to his eyeballs in debt again , unless he examined the emotional reasons behind his spending . " Personally , I 'm a financial chicken . My parents were constantly struggling to make ends meet , but you could sell my dad anything-as long as he could make the payments . I 've got sisters who go down to buy a car , and all they ask is " How much is the payment ? " The dealer says , " Four hundred dollars a month . " They say , " Well , I can do that . " When I ask , " How much did the car cost ? " they say , " Four hundred dollars . " They do n't realize that this is a $400 commitment that they 'll have to keep up month after month after month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , I could n't enjoy something if I felt that pressure of struggling to pay for it all the time . When I was younger , I 'd drive an old crummy car for three years until 1 could buy a nicer one . From the time I was 16 , I 've never had a car payment . I paid $165 for my first car : a 1955 Chevy Convertible , with no reverse . Even now , I almost never buy new cars , because I think it 's just wasted money . " Another mistake too many people make is that they think they are bulletproof and get overextended . Couples base their lifestyle on double incomes , deciding how much they spend on their car , their housing , their cloth- ing , their activities based on the premise that both partners are working and will always be working . But what happens if one of you goes down ? " DR . PHIL 'S RX : " The most obvious safety net is to have ' something in reserve . It does n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're married and you both work , do n't base your spending on a double income , or you could well wind up in bankruptcy . I 'm all for both partners working , but I think you should live as if you have only one income . Then if you get hit with illness or layoffs , you have backup . The chance of both partners being fully , gainfully employed for the length of their financial commitments is almost zero . " I understand sometimes you have to resort to credit . But I say buy what you can pay for in cash . I do n't think there 'd be much of a market for big-screen TVs if everyone had to pay cash for them . They 'd look a lot less appealing . Avoid that trap of thinking : I can pay $80 a month for this now , so I 'll commit for four or five years ' worth of payments . " Most important , examine your value system . If your happiness is tied to materialism , it 's time to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce rate in America is now over 50 percent , which means we 're worse at being married than almost anything we do . One of the main things that causes relationships to fail is that couples have unrealistic expectations . Studies show that people are most upset if what happens contradicts what they think is going to happen . If I blindfold you and tell you I 'm going to put something salty on your tongue , and I do , your reaction will be almost nonexistent . But if I tell you that I 'm going to put something sweet on your tongue , and instead put something salty on it-look out ! " It 's a similar thing in marriage . What happens when you violate expectations ? People go into shock . They start looking around for something new . One of the biggest misperceptions in relationships is the idea that if you love each other , you should n't have to work at it . How crazy is that ? Of course you have to work at it ! The fact that you love each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that you 're willing to invest the time and effort . Some partners say , " Well , it should n't be this hard if you 're the right one . ' Nothing could be farther from the truth . Marriage is work . And any time you merge two lives together , with two sets of finances , two families , two sets of values , you ca n't be naive enough to think that love conquers all . Love is like an ante in a poker game-it gets you in the game . But then you 've got to work at it . And it never ends . I 've been married 28 years . It 's not as much work now as it was at 28 days , but nonetheless you still have to be willing to expend some energy on the relationship . Too many people say , " If it 's this hard , I must have picked the wrong one . ' And they cut their losses and get out , which is not the answer . " For most of us , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunch , where life is cute and funny , and when there 's a crisis , it 's solved with a punch line , a laugh track , and a fade to commercial . Well , that ai n't what marriage is ! Couples get married and they think it 's just going to be one long date . Then they have to share space , money , resources , time , and accountability . They ca n't understand how the thing they once thought would make them so happy has left ' them feeling trapped and overwhelmed with disappointment . It 's not romantic , and not what either party expected . " DR . PHIL 'S RX : " If you are not contributing to the relationship 24/7 , then you are contaminating it 24/7 . If you feel that the spark or flame is going out in your marriage , you have to take action . Marriage does not resurrect itself once it begins to falter . A good place to start is to reflect back on why you were attracted to your spouse in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities may have gotten buried under the chores of everyday existence-what I call the damn dailies-but I 'll bet those qualities are still there . You have to make a conscious decision to focus on and appreciate the positive points of your mate . " Also remember that the principle of reciprocity is always in play . Simply put , if you want better , give better . Do n't wait for your partner to meet you halfway . This is n't a contest ; it does n't matter who goes first . Wake up every day and ask yourself , What can I do today to make my marriage better ? Maybe it 's simply to stop bellyaching for a week to sec what happens . It can be as simple as putting a note in the pocket of his shirt , or making a call simply because you were thinking about him . " Everyone loves to be admired and respected . Take the time to let your mate know that you 're really proud of them . The number one need in all people is acceptance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not putting out rejection and criticism , because if you arc , you wo n't get acceptance in return . The power of loved-based action to heal a marriage can be amazing ! " Work " One thing that people need to acknowledge is that where you will be a year from now , two years from now , is largely a product of your own choices . And nowhere is that more true than with your career . The important thing to understand is that the number one catalyst in the choices we make is fear . Which is why most people take a job . Is this the position and the salary that they really want ? No , but it 's an offer . They 'll say , Tm afraid I may not get another . So I better take it . ' People settle . And often they do what they do n't want to do because it 's either expected or they 're afraid of what will happen if they do n't . And people are unwilling to try something outside the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the other thing : The vast majority of the workforce is pretty unremarkable . They show up on time , they do their jobs , and they leave . I strongly believe that the difference between winners and losers is that winners do things losers do n't want to do . It 's not that they 're smarter or prettier , it 's that they 're willing to do things other people wo n't . " I came out here to Los Angeles and started this TV show , and I knew that the statistics were hugely against me . So what made me think I was going to be different ? I 've since learned that there were a couple of programs that filmed on my soundstage before we arrived , and I 've heard that on those shows , the principals would show up 15 to 20 minutes before start time , and they were n't prepared , and it showed . They 're history . I 'm there at 7:00 every morning , and I stay until 5:00 every evening . I do two shows that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine hours ? I 'm preparing for those two hours . Most people out there are content to just ' show up . They 're more than happy to just do the minimum . But it 's not enough if you want to excel . " DR . PHIL 'S RX : " It has often been said that we 're a selfish society , but really , I think we 're a self-less society . I think we 're so busy living in such a fast-paced world that we do n't really reflect ' on ourselves . You need to set aside some time when you 're not running errands , not watching TV , not with your spouse , to just stop and reflect on " What do I want to do ? What am I really , really good at ? What are my gifts , skills , abilities , talents , passions ? ' Then research the kinds of jobs that use those skills and abilities . A smart way to approach your job is to think of it as being in business for yourself . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a company of one . At the moment , your client is Costco or GM , but you 're in business for yourself , and how hard you work , and how much you distinguish yourself , truly is up to you . If you want to break out of the herd , you can do so with extra ideas , volunteering , and becoming actively involved in the workplace . It 's your time , it takes effort , but if you 're willing to do that , it really is n't that hard to distinguish yourself , because most people are n't trying to . " Friendship " I 've looked a lot at what makes peopie successful . And I 've never yet seen a real , big-time successful person who was a lone wolf . Every successful , person I 've known has had a nucleus of people around them who shared their passions , supported their best interests , upheld all the things that were important to them , and wanted ' them to succeed . Yet people allow themselves to get isolated-either because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed . Wc do n't think much anymore about what a friend is . What do friends do ? Well , friends stay in contact , they talk about things that matter to both of them , they 're ' honest , they 're supportive , they 're willing to give something . It can mean so much when someone who does n't have to call does and says , " How are you ? How 's it going ? " And friends do n't only say , Tm having a hard time at home . ' Sometimes they want somebody to celebrate with , somebody to be excited with . Somebody who will be happy rather than jealous if they get a promotion or a new car or have a new baby . " DR . PHIL 'S RX : " People have asked me how I define a friend , and it 's been easy in my life . The true friend is the one that 's coming in the door while everyone else is going out . They 're the ones who love you when you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular thing to do , and are there for you when you need it , even if it does n't have a big payoff for them . Sit down and define what a friend is in your own mind . And then , whether it 's a few minutes a day or a few hours a week , make contact . It 's nice to know that there are people out there who are interested in your life . And that 's a great way to initiate friendship : be interested in someone clse 's life . There 's a solid rule in friendship : If you want to have a good friend , you need to be a good friend . Give away what you wish you were getting , and it will come back to you in spades . " Parenting " The thing I see most often that runs parents off into the ditch is that they bring all of the baggage they had before they were parents into their roles as parents . If they were abused , emotionally neglected , overindulgedwhatever experiences may have been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they infect their children with that same thing . If you 've been beaten and abused and have trust issues and are paranoid , you 're going to model and teach that to your child . If you 've learned not to express your emotions , you 're going to be cold with your child , and they 're going to live with that . " Beyond what we hand down psychologically , I think one of biggest , mistakes parents can make is to expect things from a child that are not appropriate for the child 's age or lev- ' el of development . If you try to potty train a child before they have physiological control , you 're going to make them crazy . It 's like punishing them for not being tall . There 's nothing they can do about it . If you expect them to have impulse control or reasoning that is inappropriate for their age and stage of development , that 's a real problem . Most parents do n't know what the skills of a three-or four-year-old child are and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ovcrindulgence is one of the most insidious forms of child abuse known to man . If you overindulge to the point that a child deduces , I get the same thing whether I do what I 'm supposed to do or not , that 's like teaching a kid to go on red and stop on green . When you put him out in the world , he 'll be lost . The world does n't work that way . " DR . PHIL 'S RX : " I think parents need to say , " You know , I 've got some work " to do , because I 'm going to pass on my life experiences to my child . I 've got to get some peace about the mistakes I 've been making and the baggage I have from my past , so I can be unconditionally loving and accepting . ' I 've always believed that 50 percent of the solution to any problem lies in defining it . You ca n't change what you do n't acknowledge . Then you do what you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your pastor . Go read books that instruct you on what you have to do to heal . But you have to recognize that you have change-worthy characteristics and get them changed . " Parents also invariably underestimate the challenges and sacrifices in having children . They kind of go into shock when they realize , " My God , these things are not like dogs that you can play with while they 're puppies , and then put them out in the backyard . ' This is an all-day , all-night ' thing , and it runs for 20-plus years . You , as a parent , need to step up to the plate and accept that this is the biggest , hardest job of your entire life . You need to educate yourself about childhood development and parent-child relationships . Finally , you need to parent your children in a way that 's consistent with how the world runs , or you 're going to get him run over . Your child will only have one set of parents . You need to be the gatekeepers . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credo is this : You have to use food for something other than nutritional reasons in order to be chronically overweight . You have to be eating emotionally , whether it 's to celebrate or to medicate yourself for loneliness , anxiety , depression . If you use food just for nutritional reasons , you wo n't be overweight . The only ' way you can become overweight is if you use food where it does n't belong . You have to face those issues and handle psychological problems psychologically , not nutritionally . " On my show , we put together something called the Ultimate Weight Loss Challenge , where we tracked 13 people who were significantly overweight who followed my advice . The truth is , most overweight people expect to be overweight . They 've had so many failures , they 've come to expect failure . You have to challenge that expectation , and tell yourself that you can and will succeed . But some spouses of the people in our weight-loss challenge are very upset because they were comfortable when their partner was big and fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they felt they were doing their partners a favor by letting them stay fat . Now , all of a sudden , this person has a better ' attitude , is looking better , feeling better , and these spouses have to get off their dead asses and start contributing something to this relationship . " DR . PHIL 'S RX : " If you have cake and snacks and low-cost , low-yield food on hand , you 'll eat it on impulse . Get rid of it , and do n't buy it . I believe it was the change in lifestyle that caused the people in the Ultimate Weight Loss Challenge to lose more weight than they did on any fad diet on the market . They 're doing it by realigning their lifestyles and reengineering their lives . They 're taking care of mental , emotional , environmental , and social issues across the board , where being overweight just does n't fit anymore , and there 's nothing there to support it . Even these people 's homes look better . You walk into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished , because they 've cleaned up their environment .
