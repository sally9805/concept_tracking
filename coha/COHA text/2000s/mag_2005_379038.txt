" People are always surprised to learn that we still make anything here in the U.S. , " says Springs Industries CEO Crandall Bowles . The largest home-furnishings company in North America , Springs and its 14,000 employees crank out bedding and bath products , rugs and window coverings in 30 manufacturing facilities in 13 states , Canada and Mexico . Its brand names and licenses  --  including Wamsutta , Springmaid , Ultrasuede , Kate Spade and NASCAR  --  produce annual revenues of $3 billion . Springs is proof positive that U.S. textile manufacturing is very much alive . But it would be a stretch to say it 's well . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the U.S. lost more than 800,000 textile jobs from 1994 to 2004  --  about 350,000 of them since 2001  --  and 18 domestic textile plants have been closed this year . That figure includes four Springs facilities in South Carolina . <P> Springs was started in 1887 by Bowles ' great-great-grandfather Samuel Elliott White and great-grandfather Leroy Springs . Her father William Close took the company public in 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Southern textile industry was under siege from imports . A financial analyst by training ( and political wife by fate  --  she 's married to Erskine Bowles , once chief of staff under President Bill Clinton ) , Bowles understood that to remain competitive , Springs had to restructure , cut domestic production and run a more efficient operation . First she took the company private again , in September 2001 , for $1.2 billion . The family is the majority shareholder . Tom O'Connor , executive vice president , says going private gave Springs the flexibility it needed to address the tough reality facing the industry . " We also recognized early on where trade laws were going  --  that this is going to be a quota-free world  --  and said , Let 's get our ducks in a row . " <P> That meant making more ducks in China , Pakistan and elsewhere to lower costs . Springs ca n't always be cheapest , Bowles concedes . Instead she hopes that mirror manufacturing , or duplicating much of its product line domestically , will give the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spike in demand or a product starts to sell ahead of forecasting , it takes longer to get it if there 's a 90-day supply chain from China , " says Bowles . Her U.S. plants can ship in days . <P> Instead of trying to be all things to all retailers , Springs is focusing on core customers . Bowles says eight of them  --  including Wal-Mart , Kmart/ Sears and Target  --  account for about 80% of sales . That could be a risky strategy , since more retailers go directly to overseas suppliers for their store-label goods . Springs increasingly finds itself competing with its customers . Bowles is depending on good service , quick turnaround and brand power to stay in the game . <P> Given what has happened , her employees fret about the company 's ability to survive ; 75 of them have 50 or more years on the job . " One of my biggest challenges is to motivate and reassure the employees that this company does have a future and we can grow and prosper , " she says . " Everybody sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
