THE READER OF POETRY IS always on the lookout for good anthologies . Our tastes , often enough , have been formed by such classics as Palgrave 's Golden Treasury or Louis Untermeyer 's Modern American Poetry ( 1921 ) or Donald Allen 's The New American Poetry ( 1960 ) . Anthologies , to my mind , are either catch alls ( grab bags of " my favorite things " ) , with artfulness the sole principle of choice ( consider Garrison Keillor 's Good Poems , Penguin , 2003 ) ; or they fall into one of the subgatherings or niches that might be titled Eros , God , Nature , Society . A recent anthology from Liguori Publications , Simple Graces : Poems for Meditation and Prayer , 2003 , lands squarely in the category God . These are not devotional or homiletic poems , but they all have their antennae up in some way toward the divine . The anthologists , Matthew Kessler and Gretchen Schwenker ( a Redemptorist and an editor at Liguori ) , frankly state this criterion . Some of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unique sense of the divine . Others , like Robert Hayden , Naomi Shihab Nye and Denise Levertov , approach God slantwise , through human phenomena . Wendell Berry , Mary Oliver and Patrick Kavanagh speak more direcdy and familiarly . Simple Graces does not draw from the Modernist era-Eliot to Anne Sextonbut directs our interest back to the 19th century , with its attachment to rhyme and meter . Alice Meynell reappears here , effectively ; so does Herman Melville in " Shiloh : a Requiem , " from Battle Pieces . We hear from Gerard Manley Hopkins , of course , and from Ernest Dowson and Lionel Johnson , of the 1890s Rhymers Club . And finally , there is part of a devotional gem by Christina Rossetti : Lord , we are rivers running to Thy sea , Our waves and ripples all derived from Thee ; A nothing we should have , a nothing be , Except for Thee . A number of books now on the poetry shelves bespeak a new , hybrid category-Anima , or Soul . Poetry retreats , which have gained currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poems to Live by in Uncertain Times ( Beacon Press , 2001 ) , by Joan Murray . Her poem " Survivors - Found , " written after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , drew an outpouring of appreciation after she read it on National Public Radio . This showed people 's need for words that cut through prolix reportage . A sample title from this new bittersweet collection is " Try to Praise the Mutilated Word , " by Adam Zagajewski of Poland . An opening line from Theodore Roethke catches the whole gist of the anthology : " In a dark time the eye begins to see . " Right behind Murray 's anthology ( and Garrison Keillor 's Good Poems for Hard Times , Penguin , 2006 ) loom two wonderful collections in the Anima genre . One is A Book of Luminous Things ( Harcourt , 1996 ) , an international anthology by the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz . It is strong on classic Chinese poems and introduces us to his incisive countrywoman Wislawa Szymborska . Robert Bly edited the other book , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Many Cultures ( Ecco , 1995 ) . I have a long list of favorites from this collection , which leans heavily to the Sufi poets Rumi and Hafez and their Indian contemporary Kabir . I return often to Rumi 's surprising poem , " Jesus on the Lean Donkey . " In 2001 , Roger Housden started a series of " Ten Poems " books ( Harmony Books ) , in which he walks the reader through each poem , dipping into his own relevant experience . The first of the series was Ten Poems to Change Your Life ( no lack of ambition there ! ) , and the fifth and last ( 2004 ) is Ten Poems to Last a Lifetime . Billy Collins , Rilke and Mary Oliver are recurrent favorites . He concludes the final book with Mary Oliver 's " When Death Comes , " which includes her memorable self-summary , " All my life/ I was a bride married to amazement . " In 2006 Loyola Press issued its parallel to Housden in Twenty Poems to Nourish Your Soul , by Judith Valente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our times , are both striking and accessible , and the brief alternating essays help us absorb and understand them . Valente , a professional journalist , and Reynard , a judge in Illinois , do not give us close readings of the poems or artistic commentary so much as ruminations upon them , with light from their own ups and downs . ( We learn in these pages that the bond of poetry drew the pair eventually to the altar . ) Reynard and Valente have spotted and presented good poems unfamiliar to us , and made us linger with them . Among these is " To the Mistakes " by W. S. Merwin , his grateful address to whatever mistakes he has made . It ends : " I must have needed/ the ones who led me/ in spite of all that/ was said about you/ placing my footsteps/ on the only way . " Read again , carefully .
