Introduction Rosemary Edghill It is a truism of publishing that sooner or later every author wants to commit murder , and I have proof : a new take on the mean streets from Laura Resnick , a charmingly chilling story from Carole Nelson Douglas , alternate police procedurals from Josepha Sherman and Keith DeCandido-detectives amateur , private , and decidedly outside the law , in settings ranging from the haunted galleries of Elizabethan England to the worlds of the Eraasian Hegemony . And from Jennifer Roberson , perhaps the strangest detective of all . I hope you 'll enjoy these twenty stories ranging from the past through the future , set both here and ... Elsewhere . When I set out to assemble Murder by Magic , the contributors had only two rules to follow to write a qualifying story : there had to be a crime ( preferably murder ) , and magic and the supernatural had to be somehow involved , either in the commission or in the solution of the crime . As you will see , that left plenty of room for variation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham 's wisecracking supernatural adventurers to Josepha Sherman 's deadpan hilarious civil service magicians to Diane Duane 's lyrical tale of a policeman 's last case . And , yes , in Debra Doyle 's Eraasian country-house " murder , " a homage to detective fiction of the 1920s and a tragedy in the Classical sense of the word . When it came time to choose an order for the tales in Murder by Magic , I found that the stories seemed to fall naturally into five categories that turned out to pretty well encompass most of the variations on today 's supernatural detective story . Some stories were easy to fit into my five pigeonholes-a historical occult mystery certainly is , after all , and a historical mystery with animated chairs is naturally fantastical . But others I hesitated over until the last minute-was " Overrush " a Murder Most Modern or a Murder Unclassifiable ? Which subgroup did " The Case of the Headless Corpse " really belong in ? Was " Snake in the Grass " Unclassifiable or Fantastical ? At last , with much trepidation , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you may not-the fun of getting to be the editor is that I get the final say about what goes where . And certainly you 'll have your own favorite stories out of all those presented here , as I have mine ( I 'm not telling which ones mine are , but here 's a hint : there are twenty of them ) . Opinions exist to differ , but one thing I 'm sure we 'll both agree on is that , based on the evidence , the Occult Detective is alive and well a century and more after his " birth " - though Doctor John Silence might be hard put to recognize some of his literary descendants . And whether it 's a story of clandestine and unexpected magic set in the real world , or a tale set in an alternate universe in which magic openly replaces science , the rules for a good mystery-supernatural or otherwise-are always the same : find the killer and bring him ( or her , or even it ) to justice . I hope you 'll enjoy your foray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've gotten you some excellent guides . Come . There 's nothing to fear . ( Continues ... )
