<p> The most-hyped music book to hit the shelves this fall is Clapton : The Autobiography . Ol ' Slowhand was reportedly paid nearly $7 million for his none-too-revealing  --  or interesting  --  revelations . In contrast , the most engaging and best-written musical biographies often chronicle the fascinating tales of lesser-known heroes , and it 's been a banner season for these tomes . Topping the list : a long-awaited account of the band from Austin , Texas , that gave birth to psychedelic rock . <p> EYE MIND : The Saga of Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators , The Pioneers of Psychedelic Sound ( Process , $22.95 ) is an in-depth account of the group behind the 1966 hit , " You 're Gon na Miss Me , " which launched countless trips through the doors of perception and helped inspire punk rock along the way . Thanks to Keven McAlester 's 2005 documentary of the same name and a flood of articles marking Erickson 's return to live performance after years spent battling drugs and mental illness , the singer 's story has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what happened to the rest of his legendary band  --  which influenced artists ranging from Janis Joplin and Led Zeppelin to ZZ Top and R.E.M .  --  has long been obscured by myth and misinformation . <p> Paul Drummond , a British art director , Erickson fan and friend and collaborator of English musician Julian Cope , spent nine years painstakingly researching the Elevators ' accomplishments and misadventures , separating fact from fiction by digging through Texas archives and interviewing all of the surviving players , some of whom fared even worse than Erickson : Guitarist Stacy Sutherland was shot to death by his wife in 1978 , while the band 's guru , lyricist and amplified jug player , Tommy Hall , lives a hermitlike existence in a San Francisco flophouse . <p> The band 's phosphorescent rollercoaster ride makes for a riveting read , and Drummond does a fine job of not only placing it in the context of the times and the rock canon , but in the broader scope of centuries of psychedelic exploration and philosophizing  --  though he does quote a bit too often from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erickson , Sutherland and Hall was the Fleshtones , the New York group that led the first garage-rock revival in the ' 80s  --  though it always preferred the term " super rock "  --  and which stands as the missing link between the Elevators and other " Nuggets " originators and current heroes such as the White Stripes and the Hives . A Chicago area resident and teacher at Northern Illinois University , Joe Bonomo is nearly religious in his devotion to the long-running combo fronted by Peter Zaremba , who some may remember from his side job as the host of MTV 's alternative showcase , " 120 Minutes . " In Sweat : The Story of the Fleshtones , America 's Garage Band ( Continuum , $19.95 ) , the author approaches his tale with the same scholarly devotion that Drummond employed , though the Fleshtones ' struggles for success and battles with drugs and alcoholism are n't nearly as epic as the Elevators ' . <p> " For the Fleshtones , it 's never been about money or fame or the Message , egos or compromises or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been about simply spreading a good time to anyone who wants it  --  record sales , half-filled clubs , embarrassment , beat-up livers , and the occasional poor spirits be damned . But how long can a party last ? " In the end , the author concludes that it will go one as long as the musicians are still walking and breathing , and their story is ultimately one of perseverance and faith in a rough ' n ' ready aesthetic originally defined on long-forgotten 45s but so enduringly powerful that grown men devote their lives to it . <p> A similar spirit was certainly in evidence with the band that fans simply called " the ' Mats , " yet another group whose enduring influence vastly overshadowed its commercial achievements during the indie-rock ' 80s . The stories about its days crisscrossing America in broken-down vans and paving the way for the alternative-rock explosion of the ' 90s are nearly as much of a raucous good time as classic albums such as " Let It Be " ( 1984 ) . Now , veteran Minneapolis music critic Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history entitled The Replacements : All Over but the Shouting ( Voyageur , $21.95 ) <p> From the group 's first ramshackle gigs to their final show breaking up onstage in Grant Park at Taste of Chicago , Walsh traces the whole gloriously sloppy story via quotes from all of the key players  --  Westerberg declined to be interviewed , but he has spoken plenty elsewhere  --  as well as his first-hand observations as a journalist and a musician who sometimes shared bills with his heroes , and once contributed backing vocals in the studio . With another subject , this lack of critical distance could have been a shortcoming , but with a group that epitomized the ideal of anybody-can-do-it rock democracy , it 's an advantage . As Walsh writes in the preface , " After hearing so many stories for so many years , I 've come to the conclusion that , in fact , we all were/are the fifth Replacement . " <p> Finally , speaking of Westerberg and the Twin Cities ' rock scene , Zuzu 's Petals was one of the best also-rans/shoulda-beens of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never broke out of the underground but had plenty of fun while mired there . The funniest and most revealing insights into the life of a rock musician almost always come from bands that got close but never quite made it , and that 's certainly the case with Petal Pusher : A Rock and Roll Cinderella Story ( Atria , $24 ) , the winning memoir by Zuzu 's guitarist and vocalist Laurie Lindeen . Here , she considers the disturbing bitterness and jealousy female musicians sometimes sense from other women working in the music business : <p> " It 's confusing ; we 're all supposed to be educated or enlightened feminists to some degree , yet we do n't have the competition piece down  --  when is it healthy to compete and when is it that socialized sense of threat that we 're responding to ? I thought sisters were doing it for themselves , so naturally we 'd all go out of our way to help one another . Not that I have a handle on how competition 's supposed to work in the world or within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the spirited thing that spurs you on to do better , which helps the whole ' team ' as a result ? When is it a sickly pea green shade of envy ? " <p> One of the self-professed " lost girls of Generation Why , " Lindeen asks a lot questions in her book , most of all about the expectations of family and society that she finish college , settle down , become a mother and admit defeat when she is diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis . She never does , however , and the books charts her struggles to find her own way through awful gigs , worse jobs and turbulent relationships to the point of finally finding true love and contentment with her husband , former Replacement Westerberg , and their son .
