<p> Way back in the ' 20s , with the advent of radio came an intimate style of singing that addressed a single listener in the dark , and with it a style of song , syncopated , swinging , capable of verbal play and subtle tones and colors . American vernacular poetry . It shoved out the stale cream-puff operettas of Herbert and Friml and the madcap yowza-yowza-yowza vaudeville revue and took over the Broadway theater and the movies and reigned supreme until Fred and Frank and Bing got too old to be romantic and then rock ' n ' roll came in . That period , embalmed as the Golden Age of American Song , has been saluted and high-faluted in books and wept over repeatedly , but " The House That George Built " is a big rich stew of an homage that makes you want to listen to Gershwin and Berlin and Porter and Arlen all over again . <p> Wilfrid Sheed 's jazzy prose is a joy to read . It goes catapulting along , digressing like mad , never pedantic , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , like all true art , is a flight from depression , indifference , the cold blank stare , the earnest clammy touch . Sheed lopes along through decades of pop , bowing to Berlin ( whose lyrics seem " not so much brilliant as inevitable " ) and upholding some neglected masters ( Richard Whiting and Harry Warren ) , throwing some cold water ( Richard Rodgers had a " fatal taste for comfort music " ) , naming classics  --  Kern 's " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes " and of course " Stardust " and " Here 's That Rainy Day " and Ellington 's " Prelude to a Kiss " ( " I would instantly vote this the most beautiful song ever written , except for this one problem of the words ... grandiose piffle " ) . About Porter 's " Begin the Beguine , " he writes : " The chief musical gift the non-Caucasian world had to offer back then was a variety of exotic beats , and Cole would use these as a semisecret weapon to provide the kicker in his songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pistons under the melody . " He loves the music elaborately while tossing off dollops of gossip about the canoodling of the masters , Porter 's flamboyant gayness , the drinking , the meanness of Johnny Mercer when drunk and how a few lines of a song could soften him , Jimmy Van Heusen 's roistering with Frank Sinatra , " whose singing seemed to get wiser as his life got sillier and more childish , " so you get an idea where their blues came from . <p> George Gershwin is the main man , though Sheed traces the jazz song back to 1914 and Kern 's " They Did n't Believe Me " ( " And when I told them how beautiful you are , they did n't believe me " ) , not some jiggly novelty tune but elegant , swingy , " a perfect loosey-goosey , syncopate-me-if-you-care , a relaxed and smiling American asterisk-jazz song . " Gershwin is the president of the fraternity , the all-American golden boy , hyperactive , booming with self-confidence , who went up to Harlem to learn from James P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent was swift ( " no songwriter ever wasted less time reaching his prime " ) and who , when he reached the top , was openhearted and went out of his way to praise and encourage his brethren . <p> Sheed gives a nod to the beautiful myth of a music made by Jews who 'd been to Harlem , Jews with the blues , one oppressed people listening to another , the blacks using the Hebrew Bible as their text , but in the end he acknowledges that " music is not produced by whole groups , but by one genius at a time . " And those geniuses included Midwesterners who learned how to outslick the slickers , like Fred Astaire of Omaha : " Fred had uniquely mastered the art of swinging tastefully , without entirely tipping over into the down and dirty . He could be hot and cool at the same time . " And there was Cole Porter of Peru ( pronounced PEA-ru ) , Ind. , who wrote jazz songs , and smart patter songs , and was also " a sentimental country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " And Hoagland Carmichael of Bloomington , Ind . " Carmichael was , like many Americans , a divided soul , part nomad and part homebody , who seemed a little bit at home everywhere , but was probably more so someplace else , if he could just find it . ... What had dislocated him the most was the arrival of jazz , which had sneaked into rock-ribbed Indiana by way of the great music river , the Mississippi , and which would hit young Hoagland with the force of a religious conversion . " <p> The music was nothing if not memorable , so it was spread by " the average absent-minded whistlers and hummers "  --  " If you knew the music , you whistled it , as if all the backed-up melody in your head was forcing its way out through your mouth like steam from a kettle ... respectable bankers and businessmen in stark colors and homburg hats whistling their way to work like newsboys or Walt Disney 's dwarves . " And it was composed by men who tended toward glumness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Arlen  --  " Arlen 's manic side may have been almost as necessary to his compositions as his gloomy one , simply because it gave him the heart to write in the first place . In other words , he had to feel that good to tell you how bad he felt ; if he felt any worse , he could n't have written at all , even sadly . And when , for reasons beyond his control , he could n't write any more anyway , the depression that had been waiting to happen became quite suicidal . " <p> Sheed is in peak form , and the book just gets better and better . You start to hear ghosts talking and they 're funny ghosts , not stuffed shirts . " Like most of his colleagues , only a little more so , Irving always needed someone else to tell him when he was good . Witness the famous instance when he almost discarded that most palpable of hits ' There 's No Business Like Show Business ' because his secretary did n't like it , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he first heard it . A more confident man might have realized that Richard Rodgers never lit up over anything and that he was hearing this new song under the worst possible conditions : Irving was playing it himself . And Irving 's pianism was so primitive that Hoagy Carmichael once said that it had given him the heart to go on , on the grounds that ' if the best in the business is that bad , there 's hope for all of us . ' " ( Berlin also discarded " How Deep Is the Ocean " for a while . ) <p> Sheed is so engaging , he can be forgiven a sour note : " By 1945 , the kids had seized control . ... And just like that , the magical coincidence of quality and popularity was over , the music in the public square was nowhere near the best music anymore . " Not true , so not true . " Never apologize for a song that sells a million copies , " Berlin said , which covers the Beatles very nicely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so does Jerome Kern 's advice : " Stay uncommercial . There 's a lot of money in it . " Meaning : throw away the formula , break the mold , be surprising . By the early ' 50s , pop music was run by hacks , and bright young talents walked in and drove them away . George would have approved . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
