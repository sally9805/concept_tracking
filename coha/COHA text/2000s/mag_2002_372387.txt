Two European engineers start a company in Switzerland , take it public , move the headquarters to California and recruit a marketing whiz from APPLE to run it . The company evolves from a humble provider of computer mice to a seller of everything from cordless keyboards to webcams . And then it goes bust , right ? That 's the way the story is supposed to end in this grim , post-bubble era . But LOGITECH is defying that logic . <P> Despite the global slump last year , Logitech 's profits grew 66% , to $69 million , on revenues of $720 million , in the past three quarters . Meanwhile , Logitech stock recently closed above $40 , near its all-time high and up from $7.50 in February 1998 , when Apple veteran Guerrino De Luca took over as CEO . A report by CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON dubbed Logitech " the ultimate Energizer bunny : it just keeps going and going and going . " <P> This month at CeBIT , an information-technology fair in Hanover , Germany , that draws some 700,000 visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a global market more than twice the size of the one for PCs . There are a billion mobile telephones in use , plus 50 million PDAs , compared with half a billion personal computers . <P> The center of the company 's new mobile focus is the KeyCase , a folding cloth keyboard and case that works with Palm Pilots ( but not , for now , with other PDAs ) . The device looks modest , but some road warriors may end up using it in place of a laptop . <P> About the size of a regular laptop keyboard , though with slightly smaller keys , the KeyCase is made of ElekTex , a lightweight fabric invented by Britain-based ELEKSEN , which combines conductive and traditional fibers in a way that allows it to be cleaned with a damp cloth and keep working even if you spill coffee on it . When a finger hits a key , the sensing system sends electronic impulses that can be understood by conventional electronic equipment . <P> Because the case is only slightly bigger than the PDA , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why buy a regular protective case when  --  for less than $100  --  you can get one that will double as a keyboard ? Says Bernard Gander , a Logitech vice president : " After this goes into production , we can print different designs on the cloth , perhaps even Gucci or Louis Vuitton versions . " <P> A PDA slides into the KeyCase 's patented cradle while it is lying flat . A spring and hooks , designed to work on all Palm models with a universal connector , attach the handheld to the keyboard . When the cradle is moved into typing position , it automatically turns the Palm on , and you 're ready to type . " There is no need to take your notebook on the road now , " says Denis Pavillard , Logitech 's product-marketing manager . " You can just use your PDA . " <P> At CeBIT , Logitech will also launch a foldable hard-case keyboard for pdas , called the TypeAway , that will compete with those sold by TARGUS and PALM . " Targus is a great product , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be interested in it . " But Logitech is betting that it can catch up with the KeyCase and the TypeAway , which is more useful for keying in longer files , folds to a thickness of half an inch and weighs 3.9 oz. , significantly smaller and lighter than anything else on the market .
