On Stephen King 's Kingdom Hospital ( ABC , Wednesdays , 10 p.m . E.T. ; premieres March 3 , 9 p.m . E.T. ) , the creepiest sign of trouble at the eponymous medical center is not the ghost of a 9-year-old girl that patrols the halls . It 's not the occasional earthquakes  --  in Maine !  --  that rattle the grounds when otherworldly forces are upset . It 's the hospital 's corporate logo , a sleek V shape with curlicues at the top , gleaming on the building 's facade and twirling on its computer screensavers . After a few seconds , one realizes it 's actually a stylized satanic goat 's head . On Kingdom Hospital , the devil is not merely in the details . He 's in the graphic design . <P> King  --  horror author , screenwriter , jack-of-all-'fraids  --  based his new creation in part on the acclaimed Danish mini-series The Kingdom , by filmmaker Lars von Trier , and in part on his own long hospitalization after he was struck and nearly killed by a van in 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just what you would expect from King . Artist Peter Rickman ( Jack Coleman ) sees grim visions after a paralyzing accident takes him to the hospital , founded on the site of an 1869 mill fire that killed scores of child laborers . But it is also sometimes fresh , wry and even wacky . Rickman 's first visitor from the other side , as he lies broken bodied on the shoulder of a country road , is a giant anteater , who offers to serve as Rickman 's guide in unraveling the mystery of Kingdom 's haunting . The beast warns Rickman to conserve his strength and watch for the hospital 's wandering ghost girl  --  and licks off an ant crawling across Rickman 's face . " Yum ! " says the spirit creature . " Ant-solutely delish ! " <P> Kingdom Hospital is really , alternately , three different shows . The first and worst is a generically creepy , borderline-camp horror show , with images of rats running across a fetid swamp and undead hands reaching up from the deep . There 's a ghoulish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of Count Spooky 's Nightmare Theater on a UHF station circa 1965  --  who reads lines like " This is the realm of darkness " and " The ground is uneasy , and old secrets have begun to rise to the surface . " The second is a slightly ham-handed satire of corporate medicine , with Ed Begley Jr . as hospital administrator Dr. Jesse James ( get it ? ) jazzed about the money the rich artist could pump into the hospital . ( On Rickman 's arrival , a nurse mentions the need to perform a " wallet biopsy " to see how he 's equipped to pay for his care . ) The staff includes eccentric brain surgeon Dr. Hook ( Andrew McCarthy ) and pompous chief neurologist Dr. Stegman ( Bruce Davison ) . Among the patients is a psychic ( Diane Ladd ) , who , like Rickman , is picking up weird vibes in the halls . <P> The third , most unusual  --  and therefore scariest  --  show is a surprisingly playful story given that it is based on its author 's near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital and David Lynch 's Twin Peaks , though Kingdom is n't as arty , original or elliptical . But like Peaks , it is funny , which is no small feat ( compare HBO 's smart but painfully self-serious Carnivale ) . Some of the best scenes seem thrown in simply because they amused King  --  for instance , a dig at reality TV in which we see the stoner who hit Rickman , at home , racked with guilt , watching a game show in which losing contestants are electrocuted.
