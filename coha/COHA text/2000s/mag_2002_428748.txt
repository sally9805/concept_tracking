This South Carolina home will inspire you to create vour own comfortable retreat . // Nowadays , many of us move too fast to take a deep breath , and we 've lost the time to simply read a book by a fire or gather with friends to just sit a spell . We yearn for a place where life once again moves at an easy pace . This retreat in the South Carolina Lowcountry is one such place . Located near the hustle and bustle of Hilton Head Island , its land is actually unremarkable : flat , sandy timberland that boasts no mountain views or ocean access . But compared to the cost of a waterfront lot , these acres were certainly more affordable . When the current owner acquired the land as part of a timber business nearly five years ago , he had this retreat in mind . " I bought it really for mixed use , " he recalls . " We use it for family gatherings , sporting , fishing , and relaxing . " Timbering the land , however , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little clear cutting but have mainly cut selected small areas at a time . This lets us see the beauty of the woods and helps renew life throughout the forest . We started with the raw land , and that was fun . " I wanted this place to tell a story about the South and to create a special environment at the same time . I envisioned a place that took you back in time , a farm based on a good period in the post-Reconstruction South . Farms then were more like balanced , interdependent communities from which a sense of modest yet strong values grew . " Photograph top , left : // To revive these ideals , the owner knew he needed help . So he contacted Historical Concepts , a Peachtree City , Georgia , architectural firm , and convinced its president , Jim Strickland , to come to the property . " When I first saw the land , I knew we were going to have to create sense of place , " Jim says . " I suggested we look at it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . We approach many of our projects in terms of generations architecture and seek to determine how a structure may have evolved . That 's what we needed to do here . " Jim and his design team proposed a main house with a series of outbuildings to provide extra sleeping and entertaining space . " I did have some parameters for the concept , " says the owner . " I wanted an outdoor fireplace , a portion of the house cantilevered over the water , and the structure to appear to be a redeveloped wharf or cotton warehouse . " Building upon those desires , Historical Concepts created a 1,580-square-foot main house with a deck perched over the water . The floor plan is simple : It is essentially a large room divided by columns and beams with a bedroom , two baths , and a laundry room . Outbuildings , called " bunkies , " serve as additional guestrooms . As Jim notes , " The beauty of the bunkie concept is that you can add them as needed .

Photograph left : The kitchen in the main house is ready for an afternoon of cooking , yet with its crackle-finished cabinets and farmhouse-style sink , it 's attractive and inviting even when not in use . // The steeply pitched tin roofs and wraparound porches echo familiar Lowcountry architecture . But in order to pull the project off , the team had to make the house and its environs look as if they had been in place for more than 100 years . The paint colors and finishes helped accomplish this . " I remembered an old place in the Adirondacks with a similar palette , " Jim says . " The red and green add a richness that is instantly at home . We even distressed the siding by hitting it with a hand sander to rub off the final paint in places . " Inside , the house appears just as old and well loved as the exterior . Interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home come alive . " We were shooting for a boyish bunt-club-in-the-country look , " she explains . " By using mostly inexpensive antiques , we were able to instill a comfortable , worn feeling . " From the crackle finish on the kitchen cabinets to old camping lanterns used as sconces , no detail was forgotten . With careful stewardship and a heartfelt idea , this once ordinary piece of property has become a place that 's hard to leave .
