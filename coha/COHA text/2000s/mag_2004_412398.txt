SHAREHOLDER REVOLT Headnote Under pressure , the Mouse House board must pick Eisner 's successor and defend its new chairman . // MICHAEL EISNER HAS BEEN REBUKED by his own shareholders , scorned by Wall Street , and beaten up in the press . He is fighting both a takeover bid from Comcast and a dissident ex-director named Disney . He 's in trouble . But the 62-year-old CEO retains the support of one key group-the directors of the Walt Disney Co . That the board of directors remains pro-Eisner wo n't surprise anyone familiar with its reputation . Glass Lewis , a proxyadvisory firm , recently described the Disney directors as " notoriously insular , famously gullible , and blindly loyal to Mr. Eisner . " Disney directors may be loyal , but they 're not blind . Nor are they patsies anymore . Indeed , power at Disney is gradually shifting from the CEO to the board , which now must find a successor to Eisner and fend off criticism of the man they have just elected their chairman : former Senator George Mitchell , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board 's current thinking goes something like this . Eisner , whose contract runs out in September 2006 , deserves more time to show that the turnaround at the $28-billion-a-year entertainment giant is real . Earnings are up lately , as is the share price . Projections are for a 30% increase in operating income this fiscal year and double-digit increases through 2007 . " As the CEO , Michael has the support and confidence of the board , " says one director . " But he better make his numbers . " If the turnaround sputters , watch out . That raises the most important question facing the board : If not Michael , then who ? Succession was already on the agenda for the board 's next meeting , a two-day retreat in April at Disneyland . Following the stunning 43% no-confidence vote against Eisner , the topic has taken on a new urgency . Bob Iger , Eisner 's No. 2 , is the most obvious candidate . Iger , 53 , has the personal qualities Eisner lacks . He is low-key , self-effacing , and well liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to fix ABC , which remains mired in fourth place among the networks . To promote Iger would be to reward failure . Peter Chemin , 52 , president of News Corp. , is another name that will come before the board . But his close association with Rupert Murdoch and the occasionally tawdry fare at Fox television hurts his chances . The Disney directors do n't want to entrust Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck to the executive who gave us When Good Pets Go Bad . Steve Jobs , the CEO of Apple and Pixar , has neither the desire nor the ability to lead Disney . Viacom 's Mel Karmazin loves the advertising business ; he does not want to run theme parks or a movie studio . Former Warner Bros. studio chief Terry Semel , now at Yahoo , is a strong candidate , but he may be too old at 61 . That leaves a trio of former Disney executives : eBay CEO Meg Whitman , Gap CEO Paul Pressler , and Steve Burke , who is second in command to Brian Roberts at Comcast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . ( Lots of Disney stuff is bought and sold on eBay . ) She has built a great corporate culture from the ground up at eBay , and her collegial , generous management style would be welcomed inside the Mouse House . Whitman tells colleagues that she loves eBay , but the opportunity to rescue Disney might be hard and Stanley Gold , who ran the " vote no " campaign , do n't want to wait that long . Neither do many of the institutional shareholders . " His performance has been poor , and he has been given enough time , " says Christy Wood , senior investment officer of Calpers . " The directors need to separate themselves from him , or they are going to go down with him . " Some shareholders are equally outraged by the elevation of Mitchell . The former Senator was a director at Xerox during a period when management was accused of manipulating financial results and refusing to cooperate with government investigators . ( Six Xerox officials later paid $22 million in fines to settle SEC charges that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over four years . ) He was a director of Staples when the directors agreed to a controversial scheme to sell back their shares in Staples.com to the company at a hefty profit . ( They dropped that idea after shareholders sued the board . ) He was a director at U.S. Technologies , a now-defunct Internet company whose CEO was indicted on criminal charges of securities fraud . ( Former FBI director William Webster had to give up a federal appointment because he chaired the board 's audit committee . ) Mitehell also was the well-compensated vice chairman of a company called Oily Rock Group Ltd. , created by Victor Kozeny , the so-called pirate of Prague , who has been accused of bilking U.S. investors of hundreds of millions of dollars in an overseas oil deal . ( See " The Incredible Half-Billion-Dollar Azerbaijani Oil Swindle , " on fortune.com . ) Finally , Mitchell is a defendant in the shareholder suit against Disney over its $140 million payout to Michael Ovitz . ( Stanley Gold and Roy Disney arc also defendants . ) About 24% of Disney shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell could not be reached by FORTUNE , but he told the New York Times that his record at Xerox and Staples does not disqualify him from being chairman of Disney . No , but it wo n't reassure shareholders either . Sidebar FEEDBACK first@fortunemail.com Sidebar Might Meg Whitman one day run Disney ? She 's built a great culture at eBay and is loved on Wall Street . // <p>
