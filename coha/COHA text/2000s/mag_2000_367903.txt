Last Monday was the sort of lazy summer morning made for just two things : swimming and sleeping away the hours . Yet by 7:45 a.m. , the Carver Heights Edison School in Goldsboro , N.C. , was bustling . Students , toting backpacks full of fresh school supplies , filed past banners bidding WELCOME BACK and HAVE A GREAT YEAR . After a brief morning meeting , the classes settled down and eased right into the 90-minute reading lesson that starts each day . " I do n't get nervous anymore for the first day of school , " says fourth-grader Parish Brown . " I feel like I never really stop coming . " <P> He hardly does . Parish 's school is in session eight hours a day , 195 days a year . That schedule leaves just four weeks for summer break , but it means more time for students to hone their fundamentals and pursue electives like art and music . How much more time ? If Parish sticks to this regimen through 12th grade , the extra days and hours will add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students across the country are now spending their endless summer much like their falls , winters and springs  --  at school . As part of the push for higher academic standards , at least 25% of school districts  --  and twice that number in poor , urban areas  --  mandate summer school for struggling students . In Miami , Chicago and St. Louis , more than 40% of students sweat through summer school . That 's in addition to the growing number who enlist voluntarily . Public high school students in Portland are paying for summer courses . New Orleans has turned students away . <P> This demand for more class time has driven some educators a step further . More than 3,000 schools have retooled their calendars , sprinkling several shorter but " optional " breaks throughout the year , adding a month or two to the normal school year or even holding class on Saturdays . " Students today simply need more time to be successful , " says Judith Johnson , a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department of Education . " The 180-day school year is obsolete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 19th century , when family farms needed kids to till the fields in the summer . There have been periodic campaigns to lengthen the U.S. school year to match those of other nations ( Israeli children attend class 215 days , Korean kids more than 220 ) . But the U.S. has clung fast to 180 days of class time  --  and the full summer for lemonade stands and first kisses . But the sacred three-month hiatus may do more harm than good . Research shows that all children lose academic ground over the summer , scoring an average of one month lower on standardized exams than they did the previous spring . For disadvantaged students , who often spend summer break plopped in front of TV reruns rather than at day camps or on family treks to Mount Rushmore , the loss in reading can be twice that .
