<p> From abortion to sex discrimination to family leave , some of Samuel Alito 's most important rulings during 15 years on the federal bench have involved issues related to women , and some of the strongest opposition to his Supreme Court nomination comes from women 's rights groups . <p> Alito 's record on these issues is not uniformly conservative . He has voted to overturn some abortion restrictions , and he wrote a groundbreaking decision in 1993 that opened the door to political asylum for women fleeing persecution in their home countries . <p> But his opinions have more typically reached conclusions that dismayed feminist groups  --  giving states more leeway to limit abortions , making it harder for discrimination plaintiffs to get to trial , and arguing for restraints on federal regulatory power , the cornerstone of civil rights laws . <p> Alito 's opponents say those decisions show that the judge maintains the attitudes he expressed as a government lawyer in a newly disclosed 1985 job application letter , in which he described himself as a committed conservative who was proud of helping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On women 's issues , Alito 's critics say , his record stands in marked contrast to the record of the justice he would replace , Sandra Day O'Connor , the first woman ever appointed to the court . <p> " Justice O'Connor was the fifth vote in many 5-4 decisions that protected women 's fundamental rights and freedoms , " said Marcia Greenberger , co-president of the nonprofit National Women 's Law Center . " In nominating Judge Alito , President Bush has chosen someone who threatens the very existence of core legal rights that Americans , especially women , have relied on for decades . " <p> " We are dismayed by Judge Alito 's hostility to women 's rights , " said Susan Scanlan , chair of the National Council of Women 's Organizations , which counts 200 feminist-oriented groups as members . <p> Alito is not speaking to reporters about his nomination , the White House said . But some who know him say his critics are unfairly depicting him as biased based on a handful of rulings , and that none of those cases shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you look at each one of these cases ... there 's definitely not an anti-woman agenda and definitely not an anti-feminist agenda , " said Nora Demleitner , a self-described liberal who was a law clerk for Alito in 1992-93 and now is a law professor at Hofstra University in New York . <p> Demleitner cited Alito 's 1993 ruling on political asylum , the first by any federal appeals court to find that a nation 's persecution of women could be grounds for asylum in the United States . <p> Alito found that the woman in that case , an Iranian who objected to wearing a veil , did not qualify for asylum as a political refugee . But he also said persecution of women or feminists could be a basis for granting refugee status , " not something you would expect if you believed he was a staunch conservative , " Demleitner said . <p> On the other hand , she said , " I do n't think his life experience would alert him to women 's issues " in the same way it sensitized O'Connor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That may have been a factor , Demleitner said , in Alito 's most prominent abortion opinion . <p> In the 1991 case of Planned Parenthood vs . Casey , Alito dissented from a 2-1 ruling by the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia that overturned a Pennsylvania law requiring a married woman to notify her husband before having an abortion . He concluded that , for most women , the requirement would not impose an " undue burden . " <p> Alito said most married women already discussed abortions with their husbands , and that some who feared doing so would be protected by the state law 's exemption for battered wives . As long as the law had a rational purpose  --  such as protecting the husband 's interest in the welfare of the fetus  --  it was constitutional , Alito said , even if it has " a heavy impact on a few women " or " would inhibit abortions to some degree . " <p> The Supreme Court 's 1992 ruling in the same case , which upheld a constitutional right to abortion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a different tone and perspective . <p> The lead opinion by O'Connor and Justices Anthony Kennedy and David Souter focused on the plight of the women who would be most affected by the law  --  those who feared physical or psychological abuse if they told their husbands they were considering an abortion . The evidence showed that these women would constitute a " large fraction " of those covered by the law , the justices said . <p> " A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her personal choices , " they wrote . " A state may not give to a man the kind of dominion over his wife that parents exercise over their children . " <p> A comparison of the two opinions shows that Alito " discounted evidence of harm to women " because it could n't be quantified , said Judy Appelbaum , vice president and legal director of the National Women 's Law Center . <p> But Douglas Kmiec , a conservative Pepperdine University law professor , said Alito had merely been applying a previous Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be unconstitutional in nearly all its applications . The " large fraction " standard that O'Connor and the other justices spelled out in the 1992 ruling was a new approach that Alito could not have foreseen , Kmiec said . <p> Alito has taken part in two other significant cases in which he voted with a majority of his court to overturn state abortion laws . A 1995 decision struck down a Pennsylvania law requiring low-income women to report cases of rape or incest to police before receiving federal funding for their abortions . A 2000 ruling overturned New Jersey 's ban on abortions in which the fetus is removed partially intact before being destroyed . <p> Both rulings relied on Supreme Court decisions , but some anti-abortion groups have expressed concern about Alito 's acquiescence . <p> In several discrimination cases , Alito has dissented from rulings that upheld or reinstated suits by employees . He was the sole dissenter in a 10-1 decision in 1996 that restored a jury verdict in favor of Barbara Sheridan , a Delaware hotel employee who claimed she had been denied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Alito argued that the trial judge was entitled to throw out the verdict and dismiss the suit because Sheridan had provided no direct evidence that her company had intentionally discriminated against her . <p> The court majority said an employee can put her lawsuit before a jury if she shows that the reasons her employer gives for acting against her  --  in Sheridan 's case , poor performance and misconduct  --  have no basis in fact . <p> Rachel Brand , an assistant attorney general speaking for the Bush administration , described the ruling as " a narrow disagreement between Alito and the majority . " She said the Supreme Court , in a later discrimination case , adopted the reasoning that Alito had used in his dissent . <p> In another case , Alito dissented from a 2-1 ruling in 1997 reinstating a race discrimination suit by Beryl Bray , an African American employee of a New Jersey hotel who claimed she had been unfairly passed over for promotion . The majority said a jury should decide whether discrepancies in the hotel 's treatment of Bray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the hotel 's failure to follow some of its own procedures was not significant enough to cast doubt on management 's belief that the other candidate was better . <p> Alito has sided with plaintiffs in a few such cases , " but overall , when there are choices to be made , his tend to be against the victims of discrimination , " said Erwin Chemerinsky , a liberal Duke University law professor . " O'Connor is more sympathetic to victims of discrimination and to women . " <p> Pepperdine 's Kmiec countered that Alito should not be judged hostile to civil rights just because he sometimes interprets evidence differently from his colleagues in employment cases . <p> However , women 's rights groups say some of Alito 's opinions could undermine the foundation of many civil rights laws . <p> In a 1996 dissent , Alito said a federal law banning the possession of machine guns acquired after 1986 exceeded Congress ' constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce . That position was rejected by the majority of Alito 's court and by every other federal appeals court that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications far beyond gun laws , because the same congressional power over interstate commerce is the basis of most federal civil rights statutes , environmental regulations and the law banning obstruction of abortion clinics . <p> Alito 's views on those issues are unknown because he has not taken part in any other cases involving the scope of federal regulatory authority . But on a related issue  --  federal power to enforce civil rights laws against the states  --  he wrote a 2000 ruling that said Congress had violated states ' constitutional autonomy by authorizing state employees to sue for violations of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act . <p> The central question in that case was whether states that denied medical leave to their employees were discriminating against women , who more often than not are the primary caretakers of their families . Alito , like most other federal judges who had considered the issue , said Congress had no evidence that states had intentionally discriminated against women . Three years later , in a separate case , the Supreme Court cited congressional findings of sex discrimination and upheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice William Rehnquist . <p> The machine gun and family leave cases represent different aspects of a clash between federal and state authority that has been a recurrent theme at the court for the last decade . The National Women 's Law Center said Alito 's opinions in both cases reveal his opposition to " Congress ' power to act on issues that are central to the lives of women and all Americans . " <p> Kmiec disagreed . He said Alito , more than most judges , has faithfully followed Supreme Court rulings from 1995 onward  --  all of them endorsed by O'Connor  --  that have limited congressional power to intrude into state affairs and redefined federal-state boundaries . <p> " I do n't think that 's a statement of disrespect for Congress ' power , " Kmiec said , " but a statement that we are a government of enumerated powers , and Congress must make a good-faith effort to operate within its scope . " <p> Excerpts from selected opinions by Supreme Court nominee Judge Samuel Alito <p> Dissenting opinion in Planned Parenthood vs . Casey ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law requiring married women to notify their husbands before getting an abortion : <p> " An undue burden ( on abortion ) may not be established simply by showing that a law will have a heavy impact on a few women , but ... instead a broader inhibiting effect must be shown . " <p> " The Pennsylvania Legislature could have rationally believed that some married women are initially inclined to obtain an abortion without their husbands ' knowledge because of perceived problems  --  such as economic constraints , future plans , or the husbands ' previously expressed opposition  --  <p> that may be obviated by discussion prior to the abortion . " <p> Dissenting opinion in Bray vs . Marriott ( 1997 ) in which Alito voted to dismiss a suit by a black hotel employee who claimed racial discrimination in the denial of a promotion : <p> " We are allowing disgruntled employees to impose the costs of trial on employers who , although they have not acted with the intent to discriminate , may have treated their employees unfairly . This represents an unwarranted extension of the anti-discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INS ( 1993 ) , in which Alito ruled that persecution of women may be grounds for political asylum but also set strict standards for proving that discrimination in one 's homeland amounted to persecution : <p> " If a woman 's opposition to the Iranian laws in question is so profound that she would choose to suffer the severe consequences of noncompliance , her beliefs may well be characterized as so fundamental to her identity or conscience that they ought not be required to be changed .
