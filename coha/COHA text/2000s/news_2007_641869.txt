<p> At least once a week , every week , Cedric Benson has stood in front of his locker at Halas Hall and tried to answer what has been inexplicable . <p> What 's not working for the workhorse back of a self-proclaimed running team ? <p> An answer has been more elusive than the Minnesota Vikings ' Adrian Peterson dashing through the Bears ' secondary . Cast blame where you want  --  everyone else has by now  --  but for whatever reason , it has n't worked for Benson . <p> He has yet to bust a run longer than 16 yards , is on pace for 932 and has been stuck on a 3.1-yard average for weeks . <p> Plenty has been made about the Bears ' failure in the first quarter , but check out their failure on first down  --  a problem that carries through the game . Ron Turner 's unit ranks last on first down , gaining 4.27 yards per play , exactly a yard off the league average . The running game is culpable . <p> The retooled offensive line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is younger and healthier . <p> The 35-year-old Brown had been gutting it out with one arm all season . They thought his right shoulder eventually would heal , and the opposite happened . With Rex Grossman out of the picture , this group has started to take unnecessary blame to the point that it 's only a matter of time before it 's fingered for Brian Urlacher 's one-word answers . <p> To a man , the line has owned up to its responsibilities in the offense 's awful half-season  --  it ca n't be called a bad start anymore . But the line is n't blowing assignments on every snap . Out of 149 carries , Benson ought to have found a crease or two to bust a few runs deep into a secondary . <p> You ca n't help but wonder what happened to the Benson who burst into the end zone as the Bears piled it on the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game last season . How about the Benson who looks , dare we say , Peterson-like in the YouTube video of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , power , vision and traits that had the Bears drooling when they used the fourth pick on him in 2005 . <p> " That 's tough criticism , " Benson said about a comparison with Peterson , the seventh pick this year by the Vikings . <p> " You have a lot of different scenarios , different teams , different players . It 's tough to say that . " <p> OK . How about a comparison with Ron Dayne ? The Houston Texans back was the only other one in the league besides the Cincinnati Bengals ' Rudi Johnson to have a lower yards-per-carry average than Benson going into last week . <p> Then he ran through the Oakland Raiders ' defense for 122 yards on 21 carries , the fourth 100-yard game in his career . Dayne became the fifth back in as many games to top the century mark against the Raiders , who rank 30th in the league against the run . <p> " Going into every week , you 're looking forward to busting loose on Sunday , " Benson said . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment general manager Jerry Angelo has made in Benson , he 's not going to be cast off any time soon . If former wide receiver Airese Currie can stick around two full years and do nothing more than hog the MRI machine , Benson 's going to get four . <p> " I do n't know , " Benson said when asked if the next eight games could shape his future . " That 's not for me to decide . I do n't worry too much about that . " <p> Actually , it can be for Benson to decide . If the maximum effort he 's giving  --  recall Angelo 's recent assessment  --  starts turning into production , the Bears wo n't have to enter the offseason by sending out a search party to look for a capable No. 1 back . It 's obvious they do n't believe their Adrian Peterson can handle the job based on his relative inactivity . <p> Benson has an opportunity . It 's not a final chance . He 'll be here next season . Before him are opponents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otherwise , he can spin and others can deflect , and none of it will hide the facts . <p> BEARS 3-5 RAIDERS 2-6 <p> Time : 3:15 today <p> TV : Fox-32 ( Matt Vasgersian , J.C . Pearson ) <p> Radio : 780-AM <p> Line : Bears by 3o <p> THE MATCHUPS <p> On the ground <p> " We 're going to do what we do " is the credo Ron Turner 's offense lives by , and against the Raiders ' maligned defense , the Bears should be able to stick to their ground game because it 's unlikely they 'll fall behind big . Oakland has been atrocious at stopping the run , and plugging holes has consumed coordinator Rob Ryan , the son of ex-Bears defensive whiz Buddy Ryan . Oakland has yet to recover a fumble this season and quite simply is n't tackling well . Terrence Metcalf takes over at left guard for Ruben Brown . Scouts like his strength , long arms and mobility but point out he always seemed to fall short in the past . <p> KEY MATCHUP <p> Sapp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to LE Derrick Burgess depending on pass-rush situations . The Bears need to see a boost in their running game and need to neutralize the Raiders ' best pass rusher . It 's a tough assignment in Metcalf 's first start in a year and a half . <p> IN THE AIR <p> Top cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha has been banged up with a knee injury but is expected to play . He 's a bigger version of Charles Tillman . While the Raiders rank fourth against the pass , that number is skewed significantly because opponents are simply running over Oakland , then playing ball control with the lead in the second half . Still , the Bears ca n't rely on Brian Griese throwing the ball to win this game . Griese does a lot of work underneath , and the Raiders have one of the least heralded but best linebacking corps . Thomas Howard and Kirk Morrison are excellent in coverage and have combined for seven interceptions . <p> WHEN THE RAIDERS HAVE THE BALL <p> On the ground <p> Get a good look at the Bears ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is LaMont Jordan will be an offseason cap causality , and the Dominic Rhodes era is unlikely to last more than a year . But the Raiders have found success running the ball with Justin Fargas , who was thought of as a slasher but has proved to be a durable runner between the tackles as well . He 's headed to free agency after the season . Look for Oakland to run straight ahead , even with center Jake Grove unlikely to play . That 's the book for running on the Bears , and it 's about the only thing Oakland has done well of late . <p> KEY MATCHUP <p> Urlacher , iffy back and all , is n't to blame himself for the Bears ' No. 26 ranking against the run . He 's the face of the defense , though , and the player teams have tried to negate by attacking him head-on . Let 's see if he can get off blocks and make plays or if Fargas will be sprung loose . <p> IN THE AIR <p> Lane Kiffin did n't rule out having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kiffin has been reluctant to turn to Russell after he missed the entire preseason and training camp in a holdout . As fast as Al Davis rolls through head coaches , perhaps Kiffin can extend his own tenure by delaying the introduction of Russell . Starter Josh McCown screams career backup . Jerry Porter is the only deep threat , and he has a bum knee . Ronald Curry can be difficult to bring down . You have to wonder if playing with seventh-round pick Trumaine McBride has forced the Bears to play more cover-2 than even they would like . <p> X-FACTOR <p> Devin Hester , Bears KR <p> Assuming the Raiders stick with the plan of kicking to Hester  --  it 's a renegade strategy  --  he could turn into the difference-maker in a game between teams that desperately want to run the football and are n't very good at stopping the run . Field position is going to be at a premium , and no one changes that faster than Hester . He has won close games before , and while he does n't have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a loose handle on the ball like he does from time to time , either . <p> SPECIAL TEAMS
