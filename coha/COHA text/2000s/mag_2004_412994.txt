Headnote Keep an eye on these extraordinary young achievers , because the future is in their hands // Ryan PATTERSON , 20 INVENTOR When Ryan Patterson was 2 , all he wanted for Christmas was an extension cord . Strange , yes . But it makes sense when you learn that by 5 the electronics whiz had helped his father rewire their Grand Junction , Colo. , home . There were youthful missteps , of course-like a predilection for sticking screwdrivers into outlets . Admits Patterson , now a second-year electrical engineering student at the University of Colorado : " I have no idea how many times I got shocked . " He absorbed those early jolts , then proceeded to deal out a few of his own . Patterson won the title of world 's top young scientist in 2002 's Intel Science Talent Search for designing a glove that translates sign language into written text . In 2000 he was awarded a prize for inventing Sleuthbot , a high-speed robot designed to search buildings in a crisis . ( He came up with the concept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Now Patterson , who has a girlfriend and a fondness for Seinfeld reruns , is trying to install an indoor tracking device into a personal digital assistant . " It would aid people with cognitive disabilities , " he says , " and help them with daily tasks . " Do n't expect him to stop there . " I do n't think he 's going to develop just one thing that 's important , " says senior research scientist Jim Sullivan , his mentor at CU . " I look forward to a succession of very novel technologies that are going to put people on their ears . " Fred MEDILL , 18 JOURNALIST He 's not only America 's youngest A-list celebrity journalist but one of its most thought-provoking . " What kind of research do you do , " Medill asked Jim Carrey at the 2000 premiere of Me , Myself &; Irene , " to play a man suffering from advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage ? " Medill was 14 at the time . Now he 's starring on his own Web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show on WAM ! , a premium channel geared toward 8- to 16-year-olds . The secret to getting good quotes from Julia Roberts or Denzel Washington ? " You 've got to be aggressive , " says Medill , " but not obnoxious . " His red-carpet ride began when his father , Cary , 57 , won tickets to the premiere of Big Daddy and requested a press pass , giving Fred a chance to interview the film 's star , Adam Sandler . Since then , Fred has tried to give others that same opportunity through his work with the Starlight Children 's Foundation , an organization that provides support for seriously ill kids . With the help of his father , Fred has invited about 25 youths to screenings in L.A. to meet their favorite celebs . His future plans include hosting his own talk show-of course-and getting a serious girlfriend . He 's never had one , though he has a raging crush on Hilary Duff . Compared with the other stars he 's interviewed , he says , " she 's at least closer to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other sports , future track star Allyson Felix is n't filming a soft-drink commercial just yet . She 's too busy train- ing . If that goes well , Felix will get plenty of airtime this summer-on the Olympic medals stand in Athens . One s of the fastest women in the world , the University of Southern California stu- dent may hold that sole title by the end of August . Felix 's performance of 22.11 seconds in the 200 meters last May broke a world junior record . The time was also faster than the winning mark in the 1996 Olympic Games-a sign of her ability to compete for a medal now . " It was like , I belong here . I 'm just as good as these other athletes , " she says . In August the Los Angeles native became the first woman in track and field to turn pro out of high school , sacrificing her plan to join her brother Wes , 20 , on the USC track team . Her family helps Felix maintain normalcy . The siblings , who share an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 , and Paul , 51 , every Sunday for church . Her next step is the USA Olympic Team Trials in Sacramento in mid July , where the competition is often as steep as in the Games themselves . " I believe she can run faster than Evelyn Ashford , " says Felix 's coach Pat Connolly , who guided Ashford to Olympic gold in 1984 . " And I believe Evelyn to be the greatest runner we 've seen so far . " Lisa GLUKHOVSKY , 18 ASTRONOMER Lisa Glukhovsky was n't going to make a baking-soda volcano for her high school science project . Aiming higher-literally-the senior at New Milford High School in Connecticut coordinated a project to measure the distance of asteroids from the earth . Glukhovsky compared images shot simultaneously from the observatory next to her school with those from peers in Europe and California . " She 's doing the kind of work you 'd see by someone just starting out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory after completing their postdoc , " says Yale physics research scientist David Rabinowitz . The child of Russian immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an Intel-sponsored science contest last May . While she has n't committed to a college or major , she remains passionate about the possibilities of astronomy . " You can see when you look out to the sky that we 're a tiny portion of the universe . And who knows what else is out there ? " Marc MAIFFRET , 23 HACKER/ANTI-HACKER One spring morning in 1998 , computer hacker Marc Maiffret awoke with a pistol pressed to his head . At the other end of it was an FBI agent . In fact , his family 's Trabuco Canyon , Calif. , home was swarming with feds , who suspected Maiffret had tampered with military networks . He was cleared , but it put a scare into the high school dropout , who admits only to such mild mischief as leaving political messages on government and corporate Web sites . " I was up to no good , " he says . " The raid was a turning point . I knew I had to get on the right path . " Six years later Maiffret is cofounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - based firm that protects computer networks from hackers . His most famous catch : 2001 's Code Red worm , which infected networks around the world and nearly shut down servers at the White House . His 7,500 clients include the CIA and FBI . " I had to prove myself , being 17 with green hair , " he says . " But show clients you know your stuff and they get past the look . " Jourdan URBACH , 12 VIOLINIST Violin prodigy Jourdan Urbach was performing in a special venue , a center for brain-damaged children at New York City 's Beth Israel Medical Center , when something remarkable happened . " There was this child who did n't show any signs of life , " says Urbach . " I started playing and suddenly all the doctors came running-she had moved something . I think she was stimulated by the music . " If so , that was precisely the point . A seventh grader from Roslyn , N.Y. , Urbach is the founder of Children Helping Children , a charity that over the last four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New York City area . It started when Urbach , then 7 , was doing research on the brain for a school project . A random computer search turned up the work of Fred Epstein , a pediatric neurosurgeon at Beth Israel . After learning about Epstein 's patients , Urbach asked , " How can I help ? " Within a year he 'd assembled young musicians to give concerts at Beth Israel ; the group soon branched out to other hospitals . Says Epstein : " I 've never met anyone like him , and I do n't expect to . " Urbach is a bit of a Renaissance boy . The son of a music teacher and a marketing consultant , he took up the violin at 2 and performed at Carnegie Recital Hall at 6 . If that 's not enough , his novel Leaving Jeremiah was published last year . But his focus is music and striving for a goal within his reach : " to transcend the mundane .
