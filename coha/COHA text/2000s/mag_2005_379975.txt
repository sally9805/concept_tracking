Republican Senator Olympia Snowe broke her toe at home earlier this month . But that did n't stop the wiry Maine moderate from kicking President Bush while he was down last week . Twice , in fact . The Bush team was reeling from Democratic gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia and a broader G.O.P. rebellion in the House over the President 's spending bill . With centrists on a comeback in Washington , Snowe stepped up , drawing attention to the White House 's still faltering response to Hurricane Katrina . Bush 's Small Business Administration has disbursed just 103 disaster loans to businesses and 1,398 to homeowners , out of a total of 235,500 requests . In hearings that Snowe called as chairwoman of the small-business committee , she called the response " plodding " and " unacceptable . " <P> Two days later , Snowe sided with Senate Finance Committee Democrats and brought down Bush 's tax package , refusing to extend capital-gains and dividend tax cuts , more than half of which would go to households with annual incomes of more than $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices , the fiscal environment is quite different , and we have to think about what is doable , " Snowe told TIME . Her resolve , which rankled Senate G.O.P. leaders and the Wall Street Journal 's editorial page , inspired a literal thumbs-up from North Dakota Democrat Kent Conrad as he headed to the Senate floor . " It took real courage for her to stand up and say , ' We 've got to change course , ' " Conrad said . <P> Bush could face more trouble from Snowe on Iraq ( she told TIME there needs to be a " faster timetable " for handing Baghdad control ) and conservative Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito ( the pro-choice Senator so far has remained neutral ) . Into the holiday weekend , G.O.P. leaders tried to force Snowe to cut a deal on the tax cuts but , says a G.O.P. staff member , she stands firm .
