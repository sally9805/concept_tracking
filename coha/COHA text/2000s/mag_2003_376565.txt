Why do they hate you , Mr. President ? " asked Nick Robinson , the political editor of Britain 's ITV News , at a press conference in London last week . " I do n't know that they do , " the President replied . But I fear he 's too optimistic . There is something about Bush that just gets under the skin of Europeans . <P> But why ? Start with the obvious : the dislike of Bush is the repayment , with interest , of an old slight . Bush and his closest advisers were dismissive of Europe from the start . After spats over global warming and the International Criminal Court , the Administration rebuffed NATO members who pledged their support to the U.S. following Sept. 11 , 2001 . Other slurs followed , like Bush 's sneer at the American reporter who dared ask the French President a question in French . None of that made Bush loved . Now many Europeans simply doubt that his commitment to democracy in the Middle East is genuine and can not fathom why the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . <P> I suspect , however , that there are more fundamental factors at work . Bush reminds Europeans of the dark angels of their past . He is a conviction politician , a man who knows what he thinks and could n't care two hoots for what he does n't know . But after its blood-drenched flirtation with fascism and communism , Europe distrusts such certainty . Remember : Margaret Thatcher , another conviction politician , was hated  --  really , truly hated  --  by half of Britain . Bush is religiously devout , and that too calls up troubling spirits from Europe 's vasty deep . Not all Europeans are godless heathens nor all Americans washed in the blood of the Lamb . But in European memory , religious fervor has often been a source of bitter communal strife  --  think of Ireland and the Balkans . Bush is prepared to use force to advance his political goals . But after the carnage of what might be called the long European war from 1914 to 1989 , some Europeans  --  particularly older ones , in my experience  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good one . <P> Europe these days is a curiously inward-looking place . Its political class is preoccupied with the time-consuming process of building the European Union . Young Europeans , meanwhile , are enjoying the borderless , happy and comfortable world that is their own continent . I could n't prove it , but I suspect that Europeans are both less interested in and less knowledgeable about the U.S. than they were 20 years ago . They increasingly form their views of the U.S. from the sort of European journalism that stresses American weirdness , as if every American were a Botoxed , snake-handling cowboy Holy Roller , and that has produced what Nick Robinson calls a " grotesque caricature " of Bush in Europe . <P> Fair-minded Europeans who read Bush 's speech in London last week will surely adjust their image of him . I was particularly struck by this passage : " Because European countries now resolve differences through negotiation and consensus , there 's sometimes an assumption that the entire world functions in the same way . But let us never forget ... beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence are very real , liberation is still a moral goal , and freedom and security still need defenders . " Every word of that is true . If Europeans continue to hate the man who said them , they diminish not him , but themselves .
