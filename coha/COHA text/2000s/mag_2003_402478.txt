This Month 's Mailbox FAN MALE Having been a loyal Town &; Country reader for more years than I will admit , I felt it was time to let you know what a great job you do . As a fifty-three-year-old man , I may represent a small percentage of your readership ; nonetheless , I find the magazine to be a treat . It 's one of the few that manage to stay in my apartment well after the month is over . I often thought that my age might be a significant part of the reason I feel T &C; is never a chore to read , or that it 's simply required reading for my job ( I work in an apparel-related field ) , but , quite frankly , good taste is good taste . In a world that continues to be a bit too fast , a bit too unhinged and a bit too computer-oriented , Town &; Country remains focused on being modern but not " tech-driven . " Please accept my thanks for making the magazine a welcome delivery to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic on several other titles that I will not name here - after all , good taste and good manners go hand in hand . JIM S. , New York , NY Dear Jim , Thanks so much for writing . We do beep all of our reader , both female and male , in mind when planning our issues , including Town &; Country 's annual Men 's Issue , which arrives next month . We hope you enjoy it as much as our others . ITALY , A LOVE STORY Bravi ! Bravi ! Bravi ! What a glorious April issue about " Italy 's Secret Charms . " I had just returned from a month in Venice and was going through a huge pile of mail , and there it was . Never before had I read a magazine through twice . It brought the sights and smells and aura that is Italy flooding into my ( Italianate ) kitchen . I normally pass my magazines on to friends , but not this one - it has " treasure " status and will be brought out repeatedly whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep understanding of this most magical country . CYNTHIA O. , Chicago , IL Finally , there is someone out there who sees the real Italy and who may be able to end the stereotype of Italy 's equaling pizza , spaghetti , mandolins . . . . While reading your pages , I felt I was there , and thanks to your inspiration , we will visit Umbria on our next trip . I moved to Florida from Italy almost seven years ago with my husband and my two Italian children . Now we have a little American , too ! We 're hoping to move back to Italy in a few years , but in the meantime , from our house on this side of the Atlantic Ocean , we are enjoying the many beautiful things your great country offers . SABRINA B. , Ormond Beach , FL Thank you for the April article about Francesca Possati " Life in Venice , " by Melissa Biggs Bradley . I had the pleasure of staying at the hotel Bauer a few years ago and also had the privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as lovely , charming and gracious as your article describes her . How refreshing to read about someone who is discovering and utilizing the work of Venice 's modern-day artisans . It is proof that talent , hope and passion are as alive and well as ever in that most beautiful of cities . JUDY P. , North Bergen , NJ Bella Italia ! I could n't agree more with Pamela Fiori about the charm and splendor of Italy " Editor 's Letter " . From the exquisite Nardi jewels to the tour of Venice with the ever-glamorous Francesca Possati , the April issue is terrific . For those of us lucky enough to take in the magic of Italy , there were , of course , omissions , but as Ms. Fiori explains , there is no way to capture the entire picture in a few pages . However , I , for one , am grateful for the heroic attempt . MATTHEW W. , Pasadena , CA FEARLESS AT FIFTY Way to go , Patti Davis ! Her April " Health " column on turning " The Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its true virtues . To " laugh more easily and forgive more quickly , " as she writes , deflecting anything in the way of love-this really is the secret . Perhaps it should become our nation 's mantra . MARK M. , Orlando , FL FRIENDS INDEED In April 's " Social Graces " column , the Reverend Erik Kolbell tells us how to get rid of a friend we have outgrown " Goodbye , Old Friend " . I believe , however , that life never brings us quite enough of certain bounties , days and friends among them . While Rev. Kolbell may prefer one type of friend to another , to argue that he would rather have none of a particular kind seems shortsighted . Just as you would not discard fifty-dollar bills in favor of twenties because they are more convenient , it 's best to keep all your friends . For one thing , you might find that you 'll need them later , maybe on your way down .
