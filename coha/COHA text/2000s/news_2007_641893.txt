<p> Like all kids , Greg Grams likes to wake up , get dressed and go play with his toys . Greg has lots of toys  --  probably numbering in the tens of thousands . He has hundreds of cars , lots of soldier things and even antique dolls . No , Greg is n't a strange little boy . . . in fact , he is n't a little boy at all . Grams , 57 , is the owner of the country 's largest collection of cars , along with other memorabilia  --  the Volo Auto Museum , in Volo , Ill . When it comes to classic , high-performance and Hollywood cars , no one comes close to the sheer numbers of Grams ' collection . <p> In 1960 , when Grams was 10 , his father bought a 30-acre tract in what was then a rural farm area for $21,000 . He opened an antique shop and the family moved into the house where the shop was located . <p> Forty-seven years later , Grams still lives in the same house but during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first house as an adult . Maybe it 's the lessening of unbounded energy at his " advanced " age , but he said he will never , ever consider building another house again . His new home will be a security home  --  on the property and enjoying a commanding view of the Grams " compound . " The new 8,000-square-foot home will be used for meetings and other events related to his businesses . <p> You 're probably wondering why anyone needs an 8,000-square-foot home to keep tabs on an antique store . There might have been only one antique store on the premises , but that was 47 years ago . Now the property houses four auto showrooms , a vehicle restoration center , three antique malls , a Mercantile Mall , which , among other things , has the Midwest 's largest selection of die-cast automobiles , a Straw Market Mall with creations by notable local crafters , an Armed Forces Exhibit showroom , a Kids ' Hollywood Showroom , a food court and a park and picnic area . The buildings contain seven miles of aisles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country who would n't hyperventilate and develop watery eyes after seeing the hundreds of muscle cars from the mid- ' 50s up through the early ' 70s . There are Mopars , Fords , Chevys , Oldsmobiles , Buicks and other examples of Detroit-iron on display . Although the public is n't allowed to sit in them and fantasize , with the exception of cars that are in Greg 's personal collection of about 20 vehicles , it is allowed to purchase them . The prices are surprisingly reasonable . Not all the cars are originally equipped . Although the bodies are generally stock , the powertrains might have had some " alterations . " <p> Volo sells 40 to 80 cars per month . Grams ' two sons , Jay and Brian , constantly scour auto auctions throughout the country for quality vehicles that can be resold , and maintain the inventory around 300 cars . Sales were about $20 million for 2005 and the same for 2006 . Grams saw the market for six-figure car prices begin to wane and had his sons dispose of them as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so individuals now trying to sell vehicles they paid six-figures for are having trouble doing so . <p> Vehicles have been sold in most countries of the world . As I exited his office , two car enthusiasts from Denmark were waiting to see him . Grams said Russia has become a particularly active market for him . <p> Over the years , Grams has established friendships and bought and sold vehicles with some of the most noted names in the auto industry  --  people like Carroll Shelby and George Barris to name a few . Carroll Shelby 's original one-of-a-kind 1967 Mustang Cobra was put up for sale at $2.7 million . . . and it sold . <p> Speaking of Barris , the Volo Auto Museum has a room devoted to " The George Barris TV &; Movie Car Collection . " In the room are such vehicle celebrities as the Batmobile , the General Lee , the Cadillac ambulance from " Ghostbusters , " the DeLorean from " Back to the Future " and Herman Munster 's Coffin Hot Rod . <p> Other noted vehicles are Christine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining police cars from " The Blues Brothers , " Eleanor from " Gone in 60 Seconds " and Michael Andretti 's Indy 500 race car . <p> The museum is in constant use by car clubs , car shows , children and adult groups and people professionally associated within the auto industry . <p> Case in point was the Fall Rally of the Midwest Auto Media Association . For the second time , it held its program at the museum , using it as a staging area for test vehicle driving routes and for a day-long sightseeing trip down memory lane . Even the Rolls-Royce Club meets at Volo . So well-known has the Volo Auto Museum become that little advertising is needed to support it . Word of mouth is the strongest endorsement . Even though the museum has about 35 employees , its worth to the community can be measured exponentially . Hotels and restaurants have sprung up in the area . Museum parking areas have been designated for collector cars and car-club groups . There 's even free on-site overnight camping . <p> Just to name a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum were the fourth annual George Barris Collector Art Show , the Early Ford V-8 Club , the Kaiser-Frazer Owners Club , the Ride for Dreams Motorcycle Show , Chicagoland T-Bird Club , inaugural Mr. Norm 's Midwest Mopar Showdown , Toys for Tots Rally , the Windy City Z Club and Rally Insurance Customer Appreciation Day . <p> Each year , about 250,000 people pay a visit . It 's closed only three days per year  --  Easter , Thanksgiving and Christmas Day . New Year 's Day is one of the busiest days of the year . It 's obvious summer would be the busiest time , but often the museum becomes an entertainment haven for those with nothing to do on a snowy or rainy day . If you care to eat on the premises , there 's a ' 50s-style diner that offers an array of " drive-in " food , and music from the ' 50s and ' 60s is piped throughout the facility . <p> Grams plows all the profits toward building his Armed Forces Military Museum . There 's an incredible array of vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the present Iraq War . Each section is catalogued . There are uniforms , personal effects of heroes and villains alike . <p> Some of the hardware is extremely rare . For instance , Grams owns an Enemy Aircraft Obliterator  --  a WWII half-track that has four 50-caliber machine guns on a fully rotational turret . Alongside it are ammunition cars loaded with thousands of pounds of bullets constantly needed to feed the heavy guns . A 50-caliber has a voracious appetite . <p> Grams also has the only two privately-owned Military UH-1 ( Huey ) helicopters in the world . To be allowed to purchase them he had to swear that he would never allow the choppers to fly . <p> The museum also has a unique collection of big things , like one of the world 's most powerful trucks , the Brutte Boss Hogg . Mr. Hogg recently pulled down a two-story house and also pulled three monster trucks and 40 railroad cars . <p> Tickets to the Volo Auto Museum are $9 for adults and $5 for children ( ages 5-12 ) . Children under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a host of other rates for groups , seniors , veterans , etc . Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. , seven days per week . <p> The museum has a really slick Web site  --  www.volocars.com.
