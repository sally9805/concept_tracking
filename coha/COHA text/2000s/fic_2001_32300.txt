" You have another daughter . " The midwife held the squalling infant up as Anne collapsed back on her pallet , exhausted after hours of labor . Anne 's heart sank at the news . She turned her face to the wall , not watching as the midwife cut the cord , washed the baby , and rubbed salt over the quivering little body to prevent infection . " Your daughter , " the older woman said . Anne took the tiny wizened infant tenderly in her arms and wept , knowing her husband would be bitterly disappointed . He had been fasting and praying for a son . Kissing the baby , Anne held her up to the midwife . " Give the child to her father , so that he may bless her . " As the woman left the house , Anne shifted on the pallet , wincing at the pain . She strained to hear what her husband had to say , but it was the excited voice of their older daughter , Mary , she heard . " Can I hold her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet . " Joachim spoke too softly for Anne to hear . When he entered the house , she searched his face . Though he did not look at her with reproach , she saw his disappointment . Leaning down , he placed their newborn firmly in her arms once again . What could he say to ease both their hearts ? God had not seen fit to give them a son . " I love her , " Mary said , coming into the house . " We all love her , " Joachim said quickly . Ah , but Anne understood . A son would work alongside his father . A son would go to synagogue and give distinction to his father . A son would provide for his mother if his father died . A son might one day grow up and stand against Israel 's oppressors . Or even turn out to be the long-awaited deliverer , the Messiah for whom all Israel prayed . But a girl ? What use was a girl , other than to share in the daily chores ? She would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father to find her a proper husband . " I 've been considering the name Deborah , " Anne said quietly , head down . This baby was more delicate than her first , but there was a sweetness in her face that gripped Anne 's heart . " We will call her Mary . " " But Mary is my name , " their older daughter said , looking between them . Joachim put his hand on her head and spoke gently . " Your sister shall be little Mary . " Anne reached out to her older daughter . " Do n't be distressed , dear one . Go outside so that I may speak with your father . " When she was alone with Joachim , she looked up at him . " Wo n't you please consider another name , my husband ? Deborah is a strong name . And there are so many Marys . It has become the most common name in all Israel . " " And when there are enough , perhaps the Lord will finally hear our cry ! " Joachim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked away . " Her name shall be Mary . " He left the house . Anne overheard him tell their older daughter to play with her friends and leave Mama alone to rest . Anne studied her newborn 's face . " Mary , " she whispered . " My precious little Mary . " Her heart was heavy , for both of her daughters now bore a name that meant " bitterness and suffering . " The name Mary declared the depth of every Jew 's despair under the oppression of Roman conquerors . Mary was a cry to the Lord for rescue . Raising her knees slightly , Anne cradled her baby on her thighs . She unwrapped the cloth and stroked the small arms , studied the legs bowed from nine months in the womb . Tears streamed down Anne 's cheeks as she kissed the tiny hand that clasped her finger . Little Mary 's skin was softer than a baby rabbit 's . " Lord , Lord , please let her name come to mean more than bitterness and suffering . ' Let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let it come to mean God 's love upholds us . ' Let it mean trust in God , and let nothing defeat faith in you . ' Oh , Lord . . . " She wept softly as she lifted her baby to her breast . " Let the name Mary remind us to obey without fear . " One Mary sat alone beneath a mustard tree , her hands covering her face . Did all brides feel this way when the contracts were signed , gifts given , and futures sealed by the will of others ? She trembled at the prospect of life with a man she hardly knew , other than as a man admired and befriended by her father upon his arrival in Nazareth three years ago . " He 's of our tribe , Anne , " Joachim had announced after meeting Joseph at the synagogue . " And descended from the royal line of David . " " Is he married ? " Her mother cast an eye toward Mary . Thus had plans for her future been set in motion , for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a wife from the tribe of Judah , a descendant of David , a young woman of unquestioned virtue and faith . Mary knew their ambitions . Mary 's older sister was married to a Nazarene , and her parents hoped to marry their younger daughter to another man of their own tribe . And of course he must be devout , kind , and able to provide a good home for her and any children she might give him . So they invited the carpenter to their home frequently , and Joseph was receptive to their hopes . " Why did he not seek out a young woman in Bethlehem ? " Mary had asked her mother once . " Why ask such questions ? " Her mother had been impatient . " Just accept that God sent him here to Nazareth . " Her father had been less inclined to believe that God would be intimately involved in the personal life of a humble carpenter or a poor man with failing health and a daughter soon of marriageable age . " Joseph needs work like anyone else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money there than in Bethlehem . " The men had begun to discuss a match , but when her father died , Mary 's future was left for her mother to settle . And she intended to settle it sooner rather than later . " Your father wanted to give you more time , Mary , " she had said , " but time can be an enemy . You are ready to marry , and , considering our circumstances , there 's no time to waste . I 've already spoken to Joseph , and he has agreed to take you as his wife . All will be well now , Mary . We will not be left to fend for ourselves . " Now , sitting beneath the mustard tree , Mary buried her face in her arms . Would they have been left to fend for themselves ? God promised to care for those who put their faith in him . Mary believed the Lord 's promises . All she had ever wanted was to be close to the Lord . Her heart yearned for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water . How she wished she 'd been among the people delivered from Egypt . How blessed they 'd been to see God 's miracles , to hear the Law for the first time , to see water spring from a rock , and to taste the manna from heaven . Sometimes she almost wished she had been born a man . Then she could have gone to the desert cliffs of Qumran and dedicated her life to God . Was it youth that made her restless ? Her deep thirst for the Lord frustrated her . How could she love the Lord God with all her heart , mind , soul , and strength if she was to be given to a man ? How could she love God fully and still give proper honor to her husband ? And yet she understood the practicality of marriage . Women were vulnerable . How often she heard the hoofbeats of Roman soldiers approaching her little village of Nazareth . Countless times she had seen them at the well , filling their waterskins . Then they took whatever foodstuffs they needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young women as well , leaving them abused and ruined . Life could become unbearable for an unprotected woman , especially a young one . Mary 's mother had taught her to run and hide when she heard the sounds of horses or marching feet . Her heart squeezed tight with anxiety , for she could hear them coming closer now . Pax Romana had brought anything but peace to Israel , for Mary 's people fought Rome 's control . Would n't it be wiser for her to remain unwed rather than to marry and bring children into such a world ? Many Hebrews fought against Hellenistic influences with all their being , nursing their grievances , fanning their hatred into violence . Others turned traitor , rejecting the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and adopting the customs of their conquerors . Where was God in all this ? Mary knew he was as powerful now as he had been when he created the world . Was she disloyal to wonder if her people had brought this wretchedness upon themselves ? She knew the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past in order to make them turn back to him . Why must Israel repeat her cycles of disobedience , generation after generation ? And how much longer would it be until God once again sent a deliverer ? For as long as Mary could remember , she had heard her people crying out for rescue from Roman oppression . Someday the Lord would send the deliverer , the one promised after Adam and Eve 's fall from grace , the one who would make all things right , all things new . The Messiah . Every day Mary prayed for him to come . . . as she prayed now , sitting beneath the shade of the mustard tree , struggling with questions beyond her ability to understand . Torn by the turbulent world around her as well as her own now-settled future , Mary cried out for a savior . Oh , Lord , when will you send us a deliverer ? Rescue us from the foreign oppressors who carry golden idols , arrogantly proclaiming their capricious emperor a god ! She must cease this struggling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled . Mary honored her mother and would obey . Oh , Lord God of Israel , I do n't understand these things . Is it wrong to want to belong to you ? My soul longs for you . Help me to be obedient , to be a proper wife to Joseph , for you are sovereign and must have chosen this man for me . Make me a woman after your own heart . Create in me a clean heart , and renew a right spirit within me . A strange tingling sensation spread over her skin . Her hair prickled as she raised her head and saw a man standing before her . Heart thumping with terror , she stared at him , for she had never seen anyone like him before . Was it merely the sun at his back that made him look so terrifying ? " Greetings , favored woman ! The Lord is with you ! " Trembling , she sat still and silent , wondering at his words . She shut her eyes tightly and then opened them again . He was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did his greeting mean ? Were not all God 's chosen people favored ? And why did he say the Lord was with her ? Was he the Lord ? Fear filled her , and she closed her eyes again , for surely anyone who looked upon the Lord would die . " Do n't be frightened , Mary , for God has decided to bless you ! " A sob welled up inside her throat , catching her off guard , for she wanted nothing more than to please God ! But the Lord knew how undeserving she was . She blushed , remembering that only the moment before , she had resisted the idea of marrying Joseph , though he loved God as much as she . And now , this man said precious words that filled her with joy ! The stranger drew closer , his head inclined toward her . " You will become pregnant and have a son , and you are to name him Jesus . " Jesus . The name meant " the Lord saves . " The angel was still speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Son of the Most High . And the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David . And he will reign over Israel forever ; his Kingdom will never end ! " Mary swallowed , her mind whirling with the implications of his words . He was telling her she would bear the Messiah ! As soon as the words were uttered , she felt attacked by a chorus of dark voices . You ? Why would the Lord choose anyone so low ? The Messiah will not come from some Nazarene peasant girl . What evil is this , that one so unworthy should dare imagine she could bear the Messiah ! Ignore this madman . Look away from him ! Reject what he says . Close your eyes ! Say nothing ! Yet another voice spoke , a quiet voice , a voice her heart recognized . What is your answer , Mary ? She stood , tilting her head as she looked up at the angel . " But how can I have a baby ? I am a virgin . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . So the baby born to you will be holy , and he will be called the Son of God . What 's more , your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age ! People used to say she was barren , but she 's already in her sixth month . For nothing is impossible with God . " Mary drew in her breath with a smile and clasped her hands . Oh ! She knew how Elizabeth had always longed for a child . Nothing was impossible with God ! Elizabeth would be like Sarah , who bore Isaac in her old age . She would be like Hannah , dedicating her son to the Lord . The news made Mary 's faith leap . She wanted to race to Elizabeth and see this miracle for herself , but the angel stood in front of her , silent , waiting for her answer . If she said yes , she would become the mother of the long-awaited Messiah . Why the Lord had chosen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . She was uneducated , poor , and lived in an obscure village that most Jews disdained . Yet she also knew from listening to Scripture readings in the synagogue that God often used the most unlikely and unworthy to fulfill his purposes . It did n't matter who she was . God would accomplish his purposes in his way . The angel of the Lord was asking her to be part of God 's plan . And everything within her heart and soul cried out a joyous yes . Do you really think you can be the Messiah 's mother ? Do you think you will know how to rear God 's Son to be king over Israel ? The dark voices again . No . I wo n't , her heart answered . But God will . Gathering her courage , Mary looked up . " I am the Lord 's servant . " She spread her hands . " And I am willing to accept whatever he wants . May everything you have said come true . " As soon as she made her decision , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismay . She would have thought she imagined the entire episode had not the air still trembled around her . Shaken , she clutched her hands against her chest until she remembered the angel of the Lord had said not to be afraid . Letting out her breath softly , she knelt and lifted her face to heaven . She lifted her hands , palms up . Lord , your will be done . Her skin tingled strangely as she saw a cloud coming down . She placed her hands over her heart as she was overshadowed . Closing her eyes , she breathed in the scent of spring flowers , earth , and the heavens . Her skin warmed as her body was flooded with sensation . She drew in her breath and held it . For one brief space in time , nothing moved ; no sound was heard as all creation paused . Within the womb of a poor peasant girl from an obscure village in Galilee , God the Son became one with the seed of Adam . Joseph glared at Mary . " How can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hopes for a bright future were demolished . He would never have thought a girl like Maryso young , so sweet , so devoutcould betray him in so foul a manner . Pregnant ! He was attacked by emotion , shaken by it . He shut his eyes , fighting against the violent thoughts filling his mind : Denounce her ! Cast her aside ! Report her to the rabbi ! Have her stoned ! " No ! " he cried out , putting his hands over his ears . He opened his eyes and saw Mary 's mother , Anne , cowering and weeping in the corner . Only Mary was calm . " You will believe , Joseph . " She looked up at him , her dark eyes innocent . " You will . I know you will . " How could she appear so calm when , with one word , he could have her killed ? " There is only one way a woman conceives . " " For God , anything is possible . " " And God would choose you to bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face filled with joy . " Has n't God always chosen the weak to confound the strong ? Oh , Joseph . " She clasped her hands , excitement radiating from her . " Think of him . God never chooses as man would choose . " " I ca n't believe this . I ca n't ! It defies all reason ! " He had to get out of this house . He could n't look at her and think clearly . " Joseph ! " Anne rose and came after him . " Joseph ! Please ! " She cried out as he went out the door and left it ajar behind him . " Joseph ! " He ducked around the corner and walked quickly away , heading up a narrow street toward the end of town . He did n't want people noticing he was upset and asking questions . He had to think ! Out of sight of Nazareth , he wept . What should he do now ? Forget she was the daughter of a man who had befriended him , a man who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was pregnant with another man 's child ? She had committed a sin of abomination ! She was unclean ! If he married Mary now , people would point the finger at him . Both their reputations would be ruined . The gossip would circulate for years to come . And when the child was born , what then ? Everyone would know he was conceived before the wedding ceremony , and would whisper behind their hands as he passed . Why were women such weak vessels , so easily deceived ? He kicked the dirt angrily . Who could have done this to her ? Who would dare take advantage of an innocent , fatherless girl ? And why would she concoct such a ridiculous , outlandish lie to cover up her sin ? He grimaced . An angel came and told her she was to bear the Son of God ! What man in his right mind would believe such a story ? When Joachim had offered Mary to him , Joseph thought he 'd been offered a future and a hope . Now , he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to stand by and watch the daughter of Joachim stoned to death for the sin of fornication . And the child she carried would die with her . Yes ! Do it ! rasped the dark foreign voice . Why should n't she die for betraying you and her father ? Why should n't she be cut off from Israel for rejecting the Law you live by ? Kill her ! Kill the child ! The violence in his thoughts frightened Joseph and he cried out , " Oh , God , help me ! What should I do ? Why do you throw this catastrophe at my feet ? Have n't I tried all my life to do right ? to live according to your law ? " He sat , dragging his fingers through his hair . Gritting his teeth , he wept angrily . " Why , Lord ? Make me understand ! " The sun set , but he was no closer to an answer . Weary , Joseph rose and walked back to town . The streets were empty , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshop and sat at his worktable . He 'd never felt so alone . " Where are you , God ? Where are you when I need your counsel ? " He considered going to the rabbi for advice , but rabbis could not always be trusted to keep confidences . Joseph wanted no one else to know about Mary until he had decided what to do . He ran his hand over the yoke he had been carving , then picked up his tools . Perhaps work would ease his mind . Who was he to condemn Mary ? Joseph followed the Law , but he knew in his heart that it was only on the surface . Beneath the dutiful hours in synagogue , the giving of tithes and offerings , his heart was rebellious against the yoke of Rome , the yoke of corrupt rabbis , and the weight of the Law itself . How could any man help it ? Sin taunted Joseph every time he saw a Roman soldier mocking a woman at the well , or a rabbi haranguing some poor widow for her tithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work rendered , or a beggar who cursed him when he had no money to give . Though Joseph had taken countless lambs to the Temple in Jerusalem for sacrifice over the years , he had never felt completely cleansed of sin . The blood of the sacrificial lamb covered it over , and then he 'd sin again . He wanted to do right , but he found himself failing again and again . Stretching out on his pallet , Joseph flung his arm over his eyes , still undecided what action to take regarding Mary . The Law was clear , but his heart was torn . He closed his eyes , hoping sleep would enable him to think more clearly in the morning . But his sleep was tormented by nightmares . He heard angry voices and a girl screaming . He cried out , but when he tried to run , his feet sank into sand . As he struggled , darkness surrounded him and someone spoke from it . Kill the girl . Kill her and the spawn she carries ! " Joseph , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard before , but knew instantly . A man in shimmering white stood above him . " Do not be afraid to go ahead with your marriage to Mary . For the child within her has been conceived by the Holy Spirit . And she will have a son , and you are to name him Jesus , for he will save his people from their sins . " Joseph absorbed the words , his soul trembling with delight . All his life he had heard people talk of the coming Messiah . Since the time of David , the Jews had waited for another king to triumph over Israel 's enemies . And more than that , the promised Messiah would reign over all the earth . Now the time had come , and God was sending the Anointed One . And Joseph would see him . He would stand at the side of the Messiah 's mother and protect the Chosen One as his own son . You , a simple carpenter , stand as guard ? Dark laughter surrounded him , and Joseph moaned in his sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in my way . Joseph groaned again and rolled onto his back . He opened his eyes and felt the darkness around him . Fear gripped him , until a whisper pierced it . He will save his people from their sins . . . . Joseph 's longing for righteousness welled up in him like the thirst of a man lost in the desert . And he remembered the words of his ancestor , David , whispering them into the darkness : " Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty . . . . I will not be afraid of the terrors of the night , for God will order his angels to protect his Son . The Lord himself will guard him . " The darkness rolled back , and Joseph saw the stars through his window . He stared at them for a long while . Smiling , he went back to sleep . Anne wept in relief , but Mary seemed not the least surprised by Joseph 's decision to marry her quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on his arm , surprising him with a demand . " I must go to my relative Elizabeth . " Her mother protested . " Why would you want to go there ? The hill country is a hard journey " " Oh , Mother , it does n't matter . Elizabeth is with child ! " " Do n't be ridiculous ! She 's long past her time of bearing children . " " The angel told me she 's with child . " " And what do you suppose people will say when you suddenly marry Joseph and then go off to the hill country of Judea ? " " What does it matter what people say if it 's the Lord 's will I go ? " Joseph saw how the journey could solve several problems . The angel had said nothing about announcing to the citizenry of Nazareth that Mary had conceived by the Holy Spirit and would give birth to the Messiah . What if the news did get out ? What sort of dangers might present themselves to the child ? When Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they went on this journey together . . . " As soon as we are married , I will take Mary to visit her relative . " " People will talk , " Anne said . Yes , people would talk , but the condemnation would be aimed at him rather than Mary . When Mary 's pregnancy became apparent , some in Nazareth thought they now understood the reason for Joseph 's haste in marrying her . Women whispered at the well while the men shook their heads and clucked their tongues in the synagogue . What did anyone really know about Joseph , other than that he was a carpenter come from Bethlehem ? Poor Joachim . The man had trusted the carpenter because he was a relative , a descendant of David . Surely Joachim 's bones were crying out now that it was evident Joseph had taken conjugal rights before those rights were due . Some went to the rabbi and insisted the couple be disciplined so that other young people would n't think such behavior was condoned in Nazareth ! The rabbi said Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been exchanged and documents signed . A voice came out of the shadows at the back of the synagogue . " Will you not destroy the evil among you ? " The rabbi raised his head from the Torah . " Who speaks ? " " Does Scripture not say the Lord hates haughty eyes and a lying tongue ? " The voice was deep and dark and familiar to many . " We must destroy the wickedness among us . " Men glanced at one another and voices began to swell as the accuser remained in the shadows . " Who is this carpenter who defies the Law ? Who is this girl who plays the harlot ? " A man stood , face flushed . " He 's right ! " Others joined in agreement . Chilled , the old rabbi raised his hands . " The Law also says there shall be two witnesses . Let them come forward . " A low rumble moved through the gathering of men , but no one moved . Men looked about . Trembling , the rabbi rolled open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pours out lies , a person who sows discord among brothers . " He spoke quietly , but the words carried . The accuser departed . Soon after , all gossip regarding Joseph and Mary died when Roman soldiers arrived in Nazareth carrying a decree from Caesar Augustus . A census of all who inhabited the earth was being taken . Men cried out in dismay . Did this Roman " god " realize what chaos his decree would create ? For the order was that everyone must return to the village of his birth in order to be counted .
