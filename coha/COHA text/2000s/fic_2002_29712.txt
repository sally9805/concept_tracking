The house on Old Reservoir Road appeared to be in the final phases of construction . I spotted the site as I rounded the curve , recognizing the unfinished structure from Fiona Purcell 's description . To my right , I could see a portion of the reservoir for which the road was named . Brunswick Lake fills the bottom of a geological bowl , a spring-fed body that supplied the town with drinking water for many years . In 1953 a second , larger catch basin was established , and now Brunswick is little more than an irregular blue splotchlet on maps of the area . Swimming and boating are forbidden , but seasonally the migrating water birds rest on the placid surface as they make their way south . The surrounding hills are austere , gentle swells rising to the mountains that mark the northernmost boundary of the Santa Teresa city limits . I parked my VW on the gravel berm and crossed the two-lane road . The steeply pitched lot was still bare of landscaping and consisted entirely of raw dirt and boulders with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big commercial Dumpster was piled high with debris . A small grove of signs planted in the yard announced the names of the building contractor , the painting contractor , and the architect , though Mrs. Purcell had been quick to assure me by phone that she 'd drawn up the plans herself . The design-if that 's what you want to call it-would have been approved by the Department of Defense : an implacable series of concrete boxes , staunch and unadorned , stacked up against the hillside under a pale November sun . The facade was as blank as a bunker , a radical contrast to the sprawling Spanish-style homes on adjacent properties . Somewhere to the rear of the house , there must have been a driveway leading to garages and a parking pad , but I opted for the stairs built into the barren hillside . At six A.M. , I 'd done a three-mile jog , but I 'd skipped my Friday-morning weight lifting to keep this early appointment . It was just now eight o'clock and I could feel my butt dragging as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog bark . Its deep-throated yaps echoed through the canyon , conveying a message of excitement . A woman was calling , " Trudy ! Truuddy ! " while the dog barked on . She emitted a piercing whistle , and a young German shepherd came bounding over the hill , heading in my direction at full speed . I waited , bracing myself for the force of muddy feet , but at the last possible second , the whistle came again and the dog sprinted off . I continued climbing Fiona 's wide concrete steps , tacking twice before I reached the upper terrace with its plain limestone portico that shaded the front entrance . By then , my thighs were burning , I was huffing and puffing , and my heart was rat-a-tat-tatting like machine-gun fire . I could have sworn there was less oxygen in the air up here , but I 'd actually only climbed the equivalent of two stories and I knew it was probably no more than three- to four-hundred feet above sea level . I turned , pretending to admire the view while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the broad , shimmering band of the Pacific Ocean stitched to the shoreline some five miles away . Before me , the day was so clear , I could almost count the mountain ridges on the islands twenty-six miles out . Behind me , the clouds were peering over the mountaintops , a fast-moving blanket of dark gray in advance of a storm . San Francisco , four hundred miles to the north of us , was already feeling its lash . By the time I rang the bell , my breathing had slowed and I 'd done a quick mental review of the subject I was here to discuss . Fiona Purcell 's ex-husband , Dr. Dowan Purcell , had been missing for nine weeks . She 'd had a messenger deliver a manila envelope filled with newspaper clippings that recapped events surrounding his disappearance . I 'd sat in my office , tilted back in my swivel chair , my Sauconys propped on the edge of my desk while I studied the articles she 'd sent . She 'd arranged them chronologically but had otherwise presented them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the local papers , but I 'd never anticipated my involvement in the case . I found it helpful to have the sequence laid out again in this truncated form . I noticed that over the course of nine weeks , the character of the coverage had shifted from the first seventy-two hours of puzzlement , through days of feverish speculation , and into the holding pattern that represented the current state of the investigation . Nothing new had come to light-not that there was ever much to report . In the absence of fresh revelations , the public 's fascination had begun to dwindle and the media 's attention to the matter had become as chilly and abbreviated as the brief November days . It is a truth of human nature that we can ponder life 's mysteries for only so long before we lose interest and move on to something else . Dr. Purcell had been gone since Friday , September 12 , and the lengthy column inches initially devoted to his disappearance were now reduced to an occasional mention nearly ritual in its tone . The details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling events . Dr. Purcell , sixty-nine years old , had practiced family medicine in Santa Teresa since 1944 , specializing in geriatrics for the last fifteen years . He 'd retired in 1981 . Six months later , he 'd been licensed as the administrator of a nursing care facility called Pacific Meadows , which was owned by two businessmen . On the Friday night in question , he 'd worked late , remaining in his office to review paperwork related to the operation of the nursing home . According to witnesses , it was close to nine o'clock when he stopped at the front desk and said good-night to the nurses on duty . At that hour , the occupants had settled down for the night . The corridors were empty and the residents ' doors were closed against the already dimmed hall lights . Dr. Purcell had paused to chat with an elderly woman sitting in the lobby in her wheelchair . After a cursory conversation , less than a minute by her report , the doctor passed through the front door and into the night . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the complex , pulled out of the lot , and drove off into the Inky Void from which he 'd never emerged . The Santa Teresa Police and the Santa Teresa County Sheriff 's Departments had devoted endless hours to the case , and I could n't think what avenues remained that had n't already been explored by local law enforcement . I rang the bell again . Fiona Purcell had told me she was on her way out of town , a five-day trip to San Francisco to purchase furniture and antiques for a client of her interior design firm . According to the papers , Fiona and the doctor had been divorced for years . Idly , I was wondering why she 'd been the one who called me instead of his current wife , Crystal . I saw a face appear in one of the two glass panels that flanked the entrance . When she opened the door , I saw that she was already dressed for travel in a double-breasted pin-striped suit with wide lapels . She held a hand out . " Ms. Millhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was at the back of the house . Please come in . " " Thanks . You can call me Kinsey if you like . Nice meeting you , " I said . We shook hands and I moved into the entrance hall . Her handshake was limp , always startling in someone who , otherwise , seems brisk and businesslike . I placed her in her late sixties , close to Dr. Purcell 's age . Her hair was dyed a dark brown , parted on one side , with puffy bangs and clusters of artificially constructed curls pulled away from her face and secured by rhinestone combs , a style affected by glamour-girl movie stars of the 1940s . I half-expected an appearance by John Agar or Fred MacMurray , some poor , feckless male who 'd fallen prey to this vixen with her fierce shoulder pads . She was saying , " We can talk in the living room . You 'll have to pardon the mess . " Scaffolding had been erected in the foyer , reaching to the lofty ceiling . Drop cloths lined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . To one side of the stairs , there was a console table and a streamlined chrome lamp . Currently , we seemed to be the only two on the premises . " Your flight 's at ten ? " I asked . " Do n't worry about it . I 'm eight minutes from the airport . We have at least an hour . May I offer you coffee ? I 'm having mine in here . " " No , thanks . I 've had two cups this morning and that 's my limit most days . " Fiona moved to the right and I followed in her wake , crossing a broad expanse of bare cement . I said , " When do the floors go in ? " " These are the floors . " I said , " Ah , " and made a mental note to quit asking about matters far beyond my ken . The interior of the house had the cool , faintly damp smell of plaster and fresh paint . All the walls in range were a dazzling white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or drapes . A sly glance behind me revealed what was probably the dining room on the far side of the entryway , empty of furniture , subdivided by rhomboids of clear morning light . The echo of our footsteps sounded like a small parade . In the living room , Fiona gestured toward one of two matching armchairs , chunky and oversized , upholstered in a neutral-toned fabric that blended with the gray cement floor . A large area rug showed a densely woven grid of black lines on gray . I sat when she did , watching as she surveyed the space with the practiced eye of an aesthete . The furnishings were striking : light wood , tubular steel , stark geometric shapes . An enormous round mirror , resting in a crescent of chrome , hung above the fireplace . A tall silver and ivory coffeepot , with a matching creamer and sugar bowl , sat on a silver tray on the beveled-glass coffee table . She paused to refill her cup . " Are you a fan of art deco ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting for years . The rug 's a Da Silva Bruhns . This is Wolfgang Tumpel 's work , if you 're familiar with the name , " she said , nodding at the coffee service . " Beautiful , " I murmured , clueless . " Most of these pieces are one of a kind , created by craftsmen who were masters in their day . I 'd go on rattling the names off , but I doubt they 'd mean much if you 're not acquainted with the period . I built this as a showcase for my collection , but as soon as the house is finished , I 'll probably sell it and move on . I 'm impatient by nature and far too restless to stay here long . " She had strong features : thinly arched brows and dark , smudged eyes , with pronounced streaks of weariness descending from the inner corners . She took a sip of coffee and then paused to extract a cigarette from a pack sitting on the table . The lighter she used was one of those small gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover back and thumbed the striker wheel . She held the lighter in her palm and drew deeply on her cigarette , clearly savoring the relief . She tilted her head toward the ceiling and blew the smoke out in a stream . I figured I could always drop my blazer at the cleaners on the way home . She said , " I do n't think I mentioned this when we chatted the other day , but Dana Glazer suggested I get in touch with you . I believe she was Dana Jaffe when you were acquainted with her . " " Really . How do you know her ? " " I 'm helping her redecorate her home . She 's now married to one of Dow 's associates , Joel Glazer , whose first wife died . Do you know Joel ? He 's a partner in a company called Century Comprehensive that owns a chain of nursing homes among other things . " " I know the name Glazer from the papers . I 've never met him , " I said . Her call was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I could be of service . Dana Jaffe 's first husband , Wendell , had disappeared in 1979 , though the circumstances-on the surface-were very different from the current case . Wendell Jaffe was a self-made real estate tycoon who 'd faked his own death , showing up in Mexico shortly after his " widow " had collected half a million dollars in life insurance benefits . Wendell was facing jail time after a Ponzi scheme he 'd cooked up threatened to unravel , exposing his chicanery . The " pseudocide " was his attempt to avoid the inevitable felony conviction . He might have pulled it off , but he 'd been spotted in Mexico by a former acquaintance , and I 'd been dispatched by the insurance company , who wanted their money back . I wondered if Fiona suspected her ex-husband had pulled a fast one as well . She set her coffee cup aside . " You received the articles ? "
