Last week George W. Bush and John Kerry gave major foreign policy speeches , and I agreed with just about everything each man said , which means they probably did n't say much of anything useful . President Bush laid out a five-point plan for Iraq ; Senator Kerry laid out a four-point global foreign policy . Both speeches were resolute on terrorism and honest about our responsibilities to the Iraqi people . Both speeches were nattily written . Bush included some of his usual eloquent freedom riffs . Kerry 's language was clear and clean , for a change . And yet , both speeches were dispiriting for their high-minded abstractions . <P> Then again , maybe I just was n't in much of a mood to listen to speechifying about the international mess last week  --  certainly not to grand expositions of doctrine and principle tethered only vaguely to the horrors on the ground . My guess is , you 're losing patience with being orated at as well . Some evidence : An ABC News/Washington Post poll tracked " emotional responses " to the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Postmodern parade of Snow White 's dwarfs : Angry , Hopeful , Proud , Worried and Frightened . Angry had almost doubled , from 30% to 57% , since March . Hopeful and Proud had taken a hit ( although Hopeful was a still robust 62%  --  this is , after all , America ) . Worried was 67% ; Frightened , 37% . If Frustrated had been included , it might have scored 110% . Embarrassed would have done well too . Indeed , Angry is a bit vague for my taste . At whom ? The President ? The terrorists ? The media ? The French ? All the above ? On the other hand , anger , the experts say , is a primary cause of psychological depression . And most of the people I know , especially those following the situation in Iraq closely , are not feeling very peppy these days . <P> The fact is , America 's sense of itself has taken a stunning blow . We are still recovering from the last week of April , when the Abu Ghraib photos were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic radicals in Fallujah ( a retreat compounded by last week 's decision not to pursue Muqtada al-Sadr 's Mahdi Army ) . Taken together , those events represent a coherent pattern of behavior  --  that of a schoolyard bully , who tortures the weak and runs away from the strong . This is , sadly , the way Abu Ghraib and Fallujah are perceived by our enemies . I was traveling through the Middle East as some of these events unfolded , and so the embarrassment I felt was direct and intense . The experience has been more oblique for most Americans , if no less intense . Think of the images  --  not just the torture photos but also the Saddamite general riding proudly into Fallujah and , of course , the beheading of Nicholas Berg . This is , literally , the stuff of nightmares ; it is difficult to assimilate emotionally . And neither the President nor John Kerry seems able to acknowledge the souring American mood .                    @
