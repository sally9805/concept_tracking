Adam Canfield of the Slash By Michael Winerip Candlewick Michael Winerip " Adam Canfield , " said Mr. Brooks . " I need a word with you . " The teacher had his grade book open . He placed a sheet of paper under the row of boxes beside Adam 's name . " Notice anything ? " asked Mr. Brooks . Over half of Adam 's boxes had dots . " Do you know what those dots are ? " asked Mr. Brooks . Adam was pretty sure he did , but was hoping against hope there was just the teeniest little chance they might be good dots . " Class participation ? " asked Adam . " Tardiness , " said Mr. Brooks . " We 're three weeks into the school year , Adam , and you 've been late to my class ten times . " It was true . Adam 's row of boxes looked like it had caught the chicken pox . He glanced out the door . Jennifer was waving frantically . " I do n't like to make too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a good student , but -- is there a problem , Adam ? " Was there a problem ? Of course there was a problem . Adam was the most overprogrammed middle school student in America . He was on the verge of being enriched to death . The whole world plus Adam 's parents were yelling at him to hurry up or he 'd be late for his next activity . Late for baritone horn lesson , late for jazz band , late for marching band , late for the Math Olympiad club , late for the Quiz Bowl Gladiator meet , late for Geography Challenge , late for soccer , late for swimming , late for snowflake baseball , late forrunning club , and , yes , late for weekly rehearsals of the Say No to Drugs Community Players . No matter how hard Adam tried to concentrate on where he was supposed to be next , in the end he always seemed to be the late , late Adam Canfield . And now , because he was getting yelled at by Mr. Brooks -- his favorite teacher -- for being late to World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal . Late for his meeting with Mrs. Marris ! It was amazing how a few little problems could multiply and destroy a person . Continues ... by Michael Winerip
