A Series of Unfortunate Events : The Wide Window Movie Tie-in Edition If you did n't know much about the Baudelaire orphans , and you saw them sitting on their suitcases at Damocles Dock , you might think that they were bound for an exciting adventure . After all , the three children had just disembarked from the Fickle Ferry , which had driven them across Lake Lachrymose to live with their Aunt Josephine , and in most cases such a situation would lead to thrillingly good times . But of course you would be dead wrong . For although Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire were about to experience events that would be both exciting and memorable , they would not be exciting and memorable like having your fortune told or going to a rodeo . Their adventure would be exciting and memorable like being chased by a werewolf through a field of thorny bushes at midnight with nobody around to help you . If you are interested in reading a story filled with thrillingly good times , I am sorry to inform you that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baudelaires experience very few good times over the course of their gloomy and miserable lives . It is a terrible thing , their misfortune , so terrible that I can scarcely bring myself to write about it . So if you do not want to read a story of tragedy and sadness , this is your very last chance to put this book down , because the misery of the Baudelaire orphans begins in the very next paragraph . " Look what I have for you , " Mr. Poe said , grinning from ear to ear and holding out a small paper bag . " Peppermints ! " Mr. Poe was a banker who had been placed in charge of handling the affairs of the Baudelaire orphans after their parents died . Mr. Poe was kindhearted , but it is not enough in this world to be kindhearted , particularly if you are responsible for keeping children out of danger . Mr. Poe had known the three children since they were born , and could never remember that they were allergic to peppermints . " Thank you , Mr. Poe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peered inside . Like most fourteen-year-olds , Violet was too well mannered to mention that if she ate a peppermint she would break out in hives , a phrase which here means " be covered in red , itchy rashes for a few hours . " Besides , she was too occupied with inventing thoughts to pay much attention to Mr. Poe . Anyone who knew Violet would know that when her hair was tied up in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes , the way it was now , her thoughts were filled with wheels , gears , levers , and other necessary things for inventions . At this particular moment she was thinking of how she could improve the engine of the Fickle Ferry so it would n't belch smoke into the gray sky . " That 's very kind of you , " said Klaus , the middle Baudelaire child , smiling at Mr. Poe and thinking that if he had even one lick of a peppermint , his tongue would swell up and he would scarcely be able to speak . Klaus took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a book or a newspaper instead . Klaus was a voracious reader , and when he had learned about his allergy at a birthday party when he was eight , he had immediately read all his parents ' books about allergies . Even four years later he could recite the chemical formulas that caused his tongue to swell up . " Toi ! " Sunny shrieked . The youngest Baudelaire was only an infant , and like many infants , she spoke mostly in words that were tricky to understand . By " Toi ! " she probably meant " I have never eaten a peppermint because I suspect that I , like my siblings , am allergic to them , " but it was hard to tell . She may also have meant " I wish I could bite a peppermint , because I like to bite things with my four sharp teeth , but I do n't want to risk an allergic reaction . " " You can eat them on your cab ride to Mrs. Anwhistle 's house , " Mr. Poe said , coughing into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and the Baudelaire orphans were accustomed to receiving information from him between bouts of hacking and wheezing . " She apologizes for not meeting you at the dock , but she says she 's frightened of it . " " Why would she be frightened of a dock ? " Klaus asked , looking around at the wooden piers and sailboats . " She 's frightened of anything to do with Lake Lachrymose , " Mr. Poe said , " but she did n't say why . Perhaps it has to do with her husband 's death . Your Aunt Josephine -- she 's not really your aunt , of course ; she 's your second cousin 's sister-in-law , but asked that you call her Aunt Josephine -- your Aunt Josephine lost her husband recently , and it may be possible that he drowned or died in a boat accident . It did n't seem polite to ask how she became a dowager . Well , let 's put you in a taxi . " " What does that word mean ? " Violet asked . Mr. Poe looked at Violet and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet , " he said . " A girl of your age should know that a taxi is a car which will drive you someplace for a fee . Now , let 's gather your luggage and walk to the curb . " " Dowager , ' " Klaus whispered to Violet , " is a fancy word for widow . ' " " Thank you , " she whispered back , picking up her suitcase in one hand and Sunny in the other . Mr. Poe was waving his handkerchief in the air to signal a taxi to stop , and in no time at all the cabdriver piled all of the Baudelaire suitcases into the trunk and Mr. Poe piled the Baudelaire children into the back seat . " I will say good-bye to you here , " Mr. Poe said . " The banking day has already begun , and I 'm afraid if I go with you out to Aunt Josephine 's I will never get anything done .                   @ @
