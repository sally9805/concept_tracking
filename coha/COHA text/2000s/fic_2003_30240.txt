Ray - January 4 Entering Paulus Hook High School for only the second time since graduation twenty-five years earlier , Ray approached the security desk , a rickety card table set up beneath a blue-and-gold **25;551;TOOLONG banner , which still hung from the ceiling in the darkly varnished lobby four days into the New Year . The uniformed guard standing behind the sign-in book was a grandmotherly black woman : short , bespectacled , wearing an odd homemade uniform of fuzzy knit watch cap , gray slacks and a commando sweater , a khaki ribbed pullover with a saddle-shaped leather patch straddling the left shoulder . " You got a visitor 's pass ? " she asked Ray as he hunched over the sign-in sheet . " Me ? I 'm here to guest-teach a class . " " They give you a teacher 's ID ? " " A what ? " Then , " No ... " Straightening up , he was struck with a humid waft of boiled hot dogs and some kind of furry bean-based soup that threw him right back into tenth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . With all regulation classrooms booked at this hour , Ray had been offered the faculty lounge to conduct his volunteer writers ' workshop , but in his anxiety for this thing to come off he had shown up too early , walking in on four real teachers brown-bagging it around a long conference table that centered the room . Despite his stranger status , not one of them even looked his way , and after standing inside the doorway for an awkward moment , he quietly maneuvered himself behind a large scuffed desk wedged into a corner and just sat there waiting for the period-ending bell . The teachers , all men , seemed to be working their way through a hit list of rotten apples . " Rosario ? " " Out . " " Jenkins ? " " Out . " " Fanshaw ? " " Out . I talked with his mother and I think he 's out of the house , too . " " Maldonado ? " " Out . I just told him . I swear , that kid does ' Bewildered ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I do ? Suspended ! Why ? ' Because you 're on your own fuckin ' planet , Edgardo ... " " How about Templeton ... " " I 'm giving him one last chance . " " Aw , he got to you with that smile , huh ? " " Nah , nah nah , I just said , ' Hey Curtis , there 's a new statute on the books-Consorting with Known Morons . I see you with Dukey , Ghost , or any of that crew ? I do n't care if it 's a country mile from school property . You 're vaporized . ' " " Vaporized ? " " Do n't worry , he understood me loud and clear . " They were either ignoring him or simply letting him be , Ray scanning the walls , taking in the student artwork ; mostly crude cut-felt mosaics featuring idyllic tableaus of urban positivism : a black family eating dinner together , multicolored neighbors planting a community garden , big brown kids reading to little brown kids . When the bell finally rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as reluctant to go back to the classrooms as any of the students . Three of them filed out of the lounge without ever acknowledging him , but the last one made a stop at the desk , leaning forward on his knuckles to offer a confidence . " I would rate ninety-six percent of the kids in this school from OK to great ; the other four percent are just stone fucking assholes taking up space and there 's nothing we can do about it . " Alone now , Ray took in the disembodied sound track of the students out in the halls , a steady murmurous stream of agitation , punctuated by squawks , bird caws and bellows . Five minutes went by , the muffled hullabaloo gradually fading away out there , yet he found himself still facing an empty room . To conceal from himself how awkward and vaguely embarrassed he was beginning to feel , he began fiddling with his cell phone ; checking for messages , calling the sports hotline , the 970 weather forecast ; played with his datebook ; then scribbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming off busy as hell , yet when the school 's principal , Bill or Bob Egan , knocked on the open door of the empty lounge , Ray almost shot to his feet with relief .
