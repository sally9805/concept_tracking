Fade to Black Monday , 10:50 a.m. , Principal Runnels 's office , Pinedale High School clinton How do they know I did it ? They ought to give me a stinking medal . If you asked most people around here " off the record , " they 'd agree with what I did . I mean , sure everybody wants to be politically correct  --  whatever that 's supposed to mean . Just because Pinedale 's a cow town does n't mean we 're all rednecks without opposable thumbs , no matter what people from Miami might think . But people move here because it 's a safe place . Or it was . No one wants to die . All the political correctness in the world 's not worth that . And most people would agree with that , " off the record . " But on the record , there 's this little problem : they ca n't . That 's why my butt 's here in a green plastic chair in Principal Runnels 's office instead of a plain old wooden chair in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour now , since they called me out of third period . And Runny-nose is nowhere to be found . His secretary , Miss Velez , acts like he 's out on some kind of top-secret school business . But I know better . The one time , I got caught with Brett and Mo in that now-notorious mascot-swiping incident  --  he was late then , too . When he finally showed up , he was carting groceries  --  eggs and milk and Chips Ahoy . You 'd think a big important principal would get his wife to do the shopping . But you 'd be wrong . The man is PW , and if you do n't know what that means , check with me sometime when I 'm in a better mood and I 'll tell you . Miss Velez walks by , trying to look casual . But I 'm pretty sure she 's checking to make sure I have n't bolted . I stand when she comes in the room ( my daddy taught me right ) and say in my politest voice , " Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. " Yes , Clinton ? " " Um , I was thinking if Principal Runnels wo n't be here for a while , could I maybe go back to class ? We 've got a test in English , and I sure do hate to miss it . " Or , more important , I hate to miss Alyssa Black . She has that class with me . Other girls , if they 're pretty , I get tongue-tied . But Alyssa 's different in the way she looks at me . It 's not just that she 's got beautiful eyes . But she sees me different , I feel like . Other girls see a big jock who runs with the pack . With Alyssa , it 's like she . . . I do n't know , understands me , maybe . Is that corny ? It 's like she can see inside to the part that 's still this little fat kid no one likes much , the part I try to hide from most people . Today 's the day I was planning on asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my plans if she knows I 'm in here or if I get detention . Alyssa does n't hang with delinquents . Miss Velez glances at the clock . When she looks back , her face is sort of hard . " No , Clinton , you ca n't go to class . They 'll be with you in a few minutes . " She 's gone before I get the chance to ask who " they " are . Figures she 'd be against me . Alex  --  the guy this is all about  --  he 's a spic like she is . Or Latino as my mother would say . My father says those kinds of people always stick together . " That 's the problem with ' em , " he 'd say . " With the whole damn State of Florida , really . You work a job your whole life , then some spic fires you and hires his second cousin . It started down in Miami , but darned if it is n't spreading up north . And soon , it 'll be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag with him . " My father ought to know because that 's what happened to him . The getting fired part . My father was one of the most powerful men in Pinedale . But when he lost his job , my mother left him . She said it was because she could n't stand being around his " attitudes "  --  whatever that means  --  but Dad says different . He got a new job out of state , and now I hardly see him . Mom wo n't let me call him much either , on account of the cost of long distance and all the child support Dad is n't paying . Dad ca n't really afford to call us , either . Mom would say that 's a good thing . But I miss him . My mom and I do n't see eye to eye on much . She 's sort of liberal , which is really what started this whole problem with the Crusans . She 's always worrying about people 's rights and so forth . When my little sister , Melody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . Then Carolina invited Melody to sleep over their house . Mom said fine again . Go . Never mind that her HIV brother 's going to unleash the black plague on Pinedale , Florida . Never mind that we do n't know what type of germs and spores and junk is flying around their house ( I always try not to breathe too much when I 'm in class with him ) . Just go . Have fun . I tried to tell Melody not to eat anything over there and to wash her hands and not touch any sharp objects and not drink out of the glasses ( was that really unreasonable ? ) . But Mom made me shut up . " Stop scaring her , Clinton . She might say something to the Crusans . " Like she 's more worried about their feelings than her own daughter 's safety . That 's when I realized I needed to take matters into my own hands . With Dad gone and Mom acting sort of crazy , what choice did I have ? But I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to scare him so he 'd go back where he came from before anyone got hurt . I only wanted to protect my family , like my father would've.
