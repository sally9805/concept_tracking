The Searchers Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal find a forbidden love in the majestic Brokeback Mountain . by Owen Gleiberman Heath Ledger , Jake Gyllenhaal R , 134 mins . ( Focus ) Brokeback Mountain is that rare thing , a big Hollywood weeper with a beautiful ache at its center . It 's a modern-age Western that turns into a quietly revolutionary love story . In 1963 , Ennis Del Mar ( Heath Ledger ) and Jack Twist ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , a couple of dirt-poor ranch hands , take a job guarding a flock of sheep on Brokeback Mountain , a pristine jutting vista nestled in the lush Wyoming wilderness . Ennis , a crusty , taciturn loner with a scowl that might have been carved into his pale face , and Jack , an amateur rodeo rider who has held on to his optimistic boyishness , are youthful anachronisms , relics of the fading days of the Great Plains culture . But they 're still cowboys to the core ; they 've fallen into this life because it feeds something in them . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the flock , but mostly the two men have hours , days , and weeks on their hands . They jump on horses to guide the sheep across meadows and rivers ; they sit around a campfire , heating canned beans and swapping stories and a bottle of whiskey . Then , one night , when it 's too cold for either one of them to sleep outside , they do something that the old movie cowboys never did : They wrap their bodies in a rough embrace and , without a hint of seduction , they have sex , an act that 's as shocking to them as it is to us . Because it feels right , they do it again as the days go by . Yet what is it , exactly , they 're feeling , this urgent seizure of loneliness and affection and desire ? Ennis and Jack , who 've been raised in a world where to be " queer " is not to be a man ( and is therefore unthinkable ) , ca n't grasp the feeling that 's come over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In their very innocence , they are , in an odd way , a bit like the ancient Greeks , who saw homosexuality as an exalted expression of male friendship . Ennis and Jack call each other " friend , " and they mean it , but their bond evolves into a delicate , suspended romance , and Brokeback Mountain becomes their Eden , the craggy cowboy paradise from which they are destined to fall . Adapted from Annie Proulx 's brilliant 1997 short story , Brokeback Mountain was directed by Ang Lee ( Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ) from a script by the venerable Western novelist and screenwriter Larry McMurtry ( Lonesome Dove ) and Diana Ossana , and together they have coaxed Proulx 's anecdotal , through-the-years narrative into a wistful epic of longing and loss . Lee stages the picture with an enraptured tranquillity that lets each emotion shine through . At times , it 's a bit too tranquil , especially in the episodic second half , but when Brokeback Mountain takes off , it soars . Ennis and Jack drift into their separate lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they reunite over the years , going on fishing trips where no fishing gets done , sharing , however fleetingly , the connection they can barely speak of . They 're products-victims-of a closeted culture , yet secrecy and repression work on them in a special way . They 're men who have fallen in love without quite realizing that 's what 's happened to them , and the glory of Brokeback Mountain is that in tracing their fates , treating their passion as something unprecedented-a force so powerful it can scarcely be named-the movie makes love seem as ineffable as it really is . Jack , a shade more comfortable with his nature , talks of getting a ranch together , but Ennis will have none of it : Stung by childhood memories of a rancher who lived with a man and got bashed for it , he fears-he knows-that exposure could kill them . In the classic Westerns , the cowboys were often men of few words , but Heath Ledger speaks in tones so low and gruff and raspy his words just about scrape ground , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Ennis ' inexpressiveness is truly ... inexpressive , yet ironically eloquent for that very reason , as tiny glimmers of soul escape his rigid facade . Ennis says nothing he does n't mean ; he 's incapable of guile , yet he erupts in tantrums-the anger of a man who ca n't be what he is and does n't realize the quandary is eating him alive . Ledger , with beady eyes and pursed lips , gives a performance of extraordinary , gnarled tenderness . Gyllenhaal is touching in a different way , his puppy eyes widening with hope , then turning inward and forlorn . As the movie goes on , Ennis , penniless and alone , becomes a shard of a man , nurturing a lost dream . Brokeback Mountain has a luscious doomed tenor that , at times , makes it feel like Edith Wharton with Stetsons . It 's far from being a message movie , yet if you tear up in the magnificent final scene , with its haunting slow waltz of comfort and regret , it 's worth noting what , exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to knuckle under to society 's design . In an age when the fight over gay marriage still rages , Brokeback Mountain , the tale of two men who are scarcely even allowed to imagine being together , asks , through the very purity with which it touches us : When it comes to love , what sort of world do we really want ?
