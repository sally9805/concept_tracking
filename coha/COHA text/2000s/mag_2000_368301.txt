Bush 's plan would fundamentally reform Medicare by putting the focus on helping seniors buy private insurance  --  but not everyone would be guaranteed equal coverage <P> THE PLAN Bush would allow the elderly to stay in traditional fee-for-service Medicare or provide them with a fixed sum of money to pay for private insurance plans , some of which will offer a prescription-drug benefit . How much recipients pay and what benefits they receive depends on the plan they choose . <P> WHO PAYS WHAT ? Medicare would pay all costs for elderly recipients whose income was at or below 135% of the poverty line ( $11,300 , or $15,200 for couples ) . There would be a sliding scale of partial subsidies for those with incomes up to 175% of the line . It would cover at least 25% of premiums and all catastrophic costs over $6,000 for all seniors . Bush would also give states $48 billion immediately to provide partial prescription-drug coverage until the plan goes into full effect in 2004 . <P> WHO BENEFITS ? The poorest of the elderly would receive free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level would have to choose which plan they could afford . They would get a subsidy that would n't fully cover premiums and deductibles . <P> STRENGTHS AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS Bush 's plan would provide quicker drug coverage for the aging poor by sending money to the states . And it would attempt to fix Medicare 's long-term solvency problems . But it would n't provide universal coverage for all seniors . Many of those without prescription-drug coverage now might not be able to afford it under the Bush plan . And insurance companies have n't shown much eagerness to be a part of Medicare . <P>  --  WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO ? To Medicare reform $110 BILLION To states for immediate Rx drug coverage $48 BILLION To hospitals for restoring recent Medicare cuts $40 BILLION TOTAL : $198 BILLION <P> Gore would add a full prescription-drug benefit and kick in more money to keep Medicare secure  --  but without reform , the system is likely to face bankruptcy in coming decades <P> THE PLAN Gore would strengthen the current Medicare program , putting aside $435 billion to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the federal budget . And he would expand the program by adding a universal Rx drug benefit for all seniors . He also would allow people from ages 55 to 65 to buy into Medicare with the help of a tax credit . <P> WHO PAYS WHAT ? All seniors would get a prescription-drug benefit for a $25-a-month premium , with Medicare paying half the bill up to $2,000 . That would increase to half the bill up to $5,000 by 2008 . Gore 's plan would also pay all costs for the elderly who earn less than 135% of the poverty line and partial costs for those between 135% and 150% . All prescription-drug costs over $4,000 would be paid for under the plan for all seniors , regardless of income . <P> WHO BENEFITS ? Every senior would get universal benefits , including prescription-drug coverage . Low-income elderly would receive subsidies to pay for premiums and out-of-pocket costs , and people between 55 and 65 could buy into Medicare early .                  @ @ @
