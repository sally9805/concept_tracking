We 've got war , Social Security , Medicare ... Why ca n't all these " tough on spending " GOP candidates get real about taxes ? . ? NEW CENSUS DATA show that the top 1% of U.S. earners now take home a greater share of national income than at any time since the height of the go-go 1920s . The top 300,000 earners together receive almost as much income as the bottom 150 million . Democrats inhale these facts and breathe out fire . Republicans say , " Hey , this is no time to be complacent . With a little effort we can push this closer to Louis XVI levels of inequality ! " At least that 's what GOP presidential wannabes are sounding like as they genuflect before the altar of tax reduction , despite that creed 's growing fiscal , moral , and mathematical indefensibility . ( See " Questions for Ben Stein . " ) Mitt Romney wants more marginal and corporate rate cuts . Rudy Giuliani touts the endorsement of Steve " Flat Tax " Forbes . Even John McCain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cuts , now insists on their extension . Before every red-blooded tax loather spits on this page in disgust , consider the context . Over the past six years we 've borrowed nearly $2 trillion to cut taxes for the wealthiest during a time of war , meaning we 've slipped the bill for our war and our tax cuts to our kids . How do the candidates  --  who also claim to be " fiscally conservative " ( not to mention devotees of " family values " )  --  square all this ? Their stock answer is that we can cut taxes further if only we " get tough on spending . " Sounds marvelous , but when Republicans controlled every corner of Washington , they balked at trimming a teensy few million from the next trillion in planned Medicaid expenses . Bottom line : The outer limits of Republican spending-cut zeal wo n't get us anywhere close to balancing the books . And that 's before you toss in our $39 trillion in unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities . I once asked budget gurus at two conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a percentage of GDP a decade from now ( it 's 20% today ) . They casually replied 12% or 13%  --  meaning they think we 'll slice government by more than a third as 77 million baby-boomers hit their rocking chairs . This evidences either ( a ) deep disingenuousness or ( b ) deeper delusions . Neither speaks well for the state of conservative thinking . Truth is , the only way GOP math adds up is if Giuliani , Romney , and company adopt the incentives for voluntary " transitions " ( read suicides ) for 65-year-olds featured in Chris Buckley 's new comic novel , Boomsday . The most disappointing feature of the GOP case on taxes is a sin of omission . Tax-cut cheerleaders , like the Wall Street Journal editorial page , focus exclusively on the income tax . And it 's true , the top 5% of earners do pay about 58% of federal income taxes . But the income tax is only 47% of federal revenue today  --  something Republicans never want to discuss . When you throw other federal taxes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average earners ) , you find that " all in , " the top-earning 5% make about 30% of the income and pay about 40% of overall federal taxes . In other words , we have a modestly progressive system . Of course , if you had an Ayn Rand infatuation in high school that you never outgrew , you may think those top 300,000 supermen are dragging the 150 million proles around like a ball and chain , and the proles should shut up and be grateful . So let me appeal to your scientific side instead , with what I call the Plutocrat Insulation Index ( or PII ) . Take the percentage of tax cuts going to the top 1% of earners and divide that by the percentage of men and women serving in Iraq who are from the families of that same top 1% . Miller 's Social Decadence Theorem posits that as the PII approaches infinity ( which it does today ) , we 're deep in Marie Antoinette territory . With a push from those shiny new GOP tax plans , we 'll be telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a management consultant and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress .
