Section : sounding board <p> Countering the current trend to shop around for a parish that " fits " you , Peter Feuerherd makes the case for sticking with your neighborhood community . He argues that everyone loses when Catholics see churches as one more consumer choice . <p> BACK IN MY COLLEGE DAYS , I HELD A WEEKEND job parking cars at a golf club on the South Shore of Long Island . One Saturday the club rented its catering hall for an Hasidic Jewish wedding . I can still picture the river Of black-clad men , followed by women , walking down the ocean road . There was no doubt that they offered a presence : This neighborhood knew that this particular community was here to stay . <p> I do n't think the scene would have had the same impact if the wedding guests had arrived in SUVs and limos . The Sabbath injunction against driving forced the group to walk , en masse , providing a concrete neighborhood presence . The result was they were noticed . <p> Catholics used to have that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that this particular slice of earth was a papist stronghold . <p> It 's not so true any more . Today the most valuable slice of parish property might very well be the parking lot , where Catholics from all over can quietly and unobtrusively settle in after traveling some distance to Sunday Mass . An increasing number do n't even live near the churches they attend . The church , for many so-called parish shoppers , has much in common with the shopping mall . The old concept of parish geographical boundaries has fallen into disfavor . <p> Still , there is a kind of poetic wisdom  --  backed by thousands of years of pastoral practice  --  in what official church regulations say regarding the seemingly arcane issue of parish boundaries . <p> Canon 518 reads : " As a general rule a parish is to be territorial , that is , it embraces all the Christian faithful within a certain territory . " The wisdom of the church assumes that in the normal course of events the Body of Christ is found right in your own neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what all tuned-in American Catholics know . Parishes are frequently seen not as territorial entities , but as sites where like-minded people come together on Sundays . <p> We do n't like the labels , but I 'm sure you know the shorthand . Conservative Catholics travel miles to seek out Tridentine Latin rites ; liberal Catholics seek out a liturgy with snazzy music or feel-good sermons . In a consumer culture , we have increasingly seen church liturgy and community as simply another choice of competing brands , faith versions of Coke vs . Pepsi . <p> Churches develop market niches : St. Benedict has great Gregorian chant , St. Perpetua features upbeat St. Louis Jesuit music , and St. George is where the priest preaches on Election Day that God is a pro-life Republican . At Our Son of Justice Church on the other side of town , however , God is usually referred to as a liberal Democrat . <p> It 's increasingly difficult to persuade parish shoppers that their neighborhood churches might have something to offer when competitive behemoths , kind of like ecclesial Wal-Mart or Target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interstate . A recent study by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate ( CARA ) at Georgetown University indicated that about a quarter of Catholics regularly attend parishes outside their neighborhood . <p> SO WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DISCOURAGE PARISH shopping ? What could be more American ? Should n't faithful Catholics go where they feel most comfortable ? <p> Well , not exactly . Catholics dare to call themselves the Body of Christ . That Body can sometimes feel uncomfortable , even sickly . Yet the analogy implies that we are to reach out of our own bodies and become part of something bigger . <p> Ideally , the parish is intended to be a faith family , not a motley collection of jaded consumers . It 's one thing to choose Target over K-Mart , quite another to trade that sometimes cranky 3-year-old for a more sedate child . Yet the consumer temptation is real , and in a culture that takes that mentality for granted , it has become a routine of Catholic life , even if below the radar screen of most churchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Walter J. Burghardt writes that " some Catholics refuse to worship with other Catholics save on their own narrow terms . " Those terms can include a similar social class , ideological temperament , ethnicity , or age . Yet imposing these conditions is a stab to the heart of the unity of the Body of Christ . It 's not that parish shoppers are evil . They might , however , be establishing an alternative structure of church without thinking through what is being lost , namely the vitality of the neighborhood parish . <p> I knew one pastor in a Midwest city who was bright , ready , and eager to invigorate a church where he was assigned . Yet the core of his potentially most involved parishioners had already hightailed it down the road to what was considered a more dynamic Catholic parish . <p> The neighborhood parish , by contrast , is a living response to Robert Putnam 's call for the need for social networks outlined in his famous book Bowling Alone ( Simon &; Schuster ) . Catholics in healthy neighborhood parishes do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar faces at the local alleys . <p> It 's more than social , though . It 's deeper . Catholic thinkers have marveled at the vitality of neighborhood parishes . Thomas Merton and Dorothy Day , perhaps the two most famous American converts , said they were attracted to the church through regular working people coming together in unity around the Eucharist in simple neighborhood churches . It is a central aspect of Catholic theology , argues sociologist Father Andrew Greeley . <p> " For the churches of the Reformation , salvation is essentially an individual activity . For Catholicism it has always been essentially a communal activity , " says Greeley , who regularly waxes warmly about his own experience growing up in a Chicago parish . <p> YET , WHILE AWARE OF ALL THIS , I TOO MUST ADMIT TO having been , at times , a parish shopper . I 've lived in five different metropolitan areas . Sometimes my wife and I traveled to parishes where , for example , we thought our then-young children would find a good religious education program with other young couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ohio , we found ourselves mesmerized by the weekly homilies of a priest who recounted vivid tales from his African mission days , even though his church was some 10 miles from our apartment . <p> Still , in exploring my own spiritual journey , I have found that blooming where I have been planted has proved to be a deeper experience . <p> Right after college I moved to Indianapolis , where I walked to my neighborhood parish . Having grown up in suburban Long Island , I was conditioned to think that Catholics were almost always Irish , or sometimes Italian . My Indianapolis parish was almost all African American , many of the parishioners converts . From them I discovered the beauty of two-hour liturgies with soaring preaching and involvement in a neighborhood that benefited from their presence . <p> I currently live in Queens , New York and attend my neighborhood parish . After we moved back to New York 13 years ago , I thought of finding my spiritual home at my old college , which was familiar and had developed a reputation for lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I resisted the temptation , and I 'm glad I did . At my neighborhood parish , we 're blessedly not all the same . I 'm improving my Spanish by regularly attending a Sunday Mass in that language geared to new immigrants . I attend a men 's spirituality group where  --  at 46  --  I am the youngest of the dozen or so regulars . At first I wondered what these old guys had to tell me . But I discovered they are a font of seasoned wisdom , having navigated through to retirement age with their spirituality and humor intact . <p> NOT EVERYONE HAS SUCH HAPPY LOCAL EXPERIENCES , granted . If you 're a parish shopper and have found a spiritual niche , despite canon law , the odds are unlikely that the pope will send out the Swiss Guard to lasso you back to your neighborhood church . Your bishop is probably happy to count you among those faithful Catholics who are in the pews each Sunday . <p> I 'm willing to concede that it 's possible that your neighborhood church might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps you have had bad experiences in your local parish that have caused you to search elsewhere . Maybe the homilies are lukewarm . ( The CARA study indicates that most parish shoppers seek out better sermons and are likely to be under 30 . ) Perhaps you have a zeal to assist a parish in an area where direct social ministry with the poor is possible , and that personal contribution is worth your commute from a more wealthy area . <p> All these are potentially good reasons to savor the taste of a church community away from your neighborhood . Even the canon law on parish boundaries allows for exceptions . <p> Yet I still feel that those quarter of American Catholics who are shoppers might benefit from some home cooking in their parish church . Better yet , they can contribute to the stew of their own neighborhood faith life and try and make a contribution where they live . They just might be surprised what they find there , if they give it a chance . And if they join a few friends on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's something important happening right in their own backyards . <p> Advance copies of Sounding Board are mailed to a sample of U.S. CATHOLIC subscribers .
