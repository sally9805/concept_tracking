He did n't look dangerous , not at first glance . Still , a girl can never be too careful on a blind date , and that 's why I 'd insisted Mr. Sand meet me in a popular steak-house nestled in a casino dead center on the Las Vegas Strip . It was , I 'd thought , the most public of all public places . Yet now , watching the way shadows from the muted lighting sought out the unhealthy hollows beneath his eyes and cheeks , and the way he toyed with his blue cheese and endive appetizer , I decided the most ominous thing about Mr. Sand was a deeply embedded issue with self-control , and the only thing I was in danger of dying from was boredom . Of course , that was before I really knew him . And before my death the very next day . At the time I had no way of knowing Mr. Sand 's true intentions , not like now . Besides , who knew homicidal maniacs came wrapped in horse-faced packages with little to no fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam 's apple bobbed like a buoy above the opening of his pressed shirt , while knobby bones protruded at both knuckles and wrists . Ichabod Crane in a poorly fitted suit . Not exactly intimidating . Looks aside , the next mark against him was his first name . " Ajax ? " I repeated as our soups arrived , notquite sure I 'd heard right . He nodded , lifting his spoon , though I noted he did n't actually use it . " Ajax . " " Like the cleaner ? " His smile was tight . " Like the Greek warrior . " I mean , really . Cursing my sister for setting me up on yet another blind date-and myself for letting her-I nevertheless tried to plant my feet firmly on the bright side of things . At least this one could walk without dragging his knuckles on the ground . And even if the woman in me had recoiled at first sight , the photographer in me had something to do . I tried to picture Ajax in a bank , as he 'd already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat on its ass without him , but I could n't quite imagine him languishing behind a desk . There was too much movement , too much latent energy in those snaking limbs for that . His fingers twined and untwined , his bony elbows rose to rest on the table only to drop a second later , and his eyes darted around the dining room , taking in everything but never fully settling . I 'd like to still those relentless limbs with my camera , I decided . Take time to study those shifting eyes . See just who Mr. Sand became when seen in two dimensions instead of three . He looked at me like he knew what I was thinking . And it was that look , those eyes , that sent up the first red flag . I do n't mean the color , a blue so light it was nearly transparent , but more the way they tried to own me . I licked my lips , and his eyes dropped to watch my tongue dart out . I ran a hand through my bobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers fisted there . I exhaled deeply , forcing myself to relax , and for some reason that made him smile . I was jumpy , I confess , but I recognized that hungry look . I 'd seen it once before , long before I 'd ever started dating . I 'd hoped never to see it again . " So , what do you do for a living ? " Ajax asked , finally breaking the silence . " I mean , you do n't just live off Daddy 's money , do you ? " This was followed by a shallow " just joking " guffaw , one belied by how carefully he continued to watch me . I ran my fingers over the stem of my wineglass , wondering just how long it would take Ajax to notice that mine were n't the hands of a debutante , but those of a fighter . " I take photographs . " " Like weddings or models or something ? " " Like people . Shapes . Shadows . Usually night shots using natural lighting and gritty settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , drawing the word out , " you do n't make money at it ? " " Not yet . " He looked at me like I should apologize . He probably was a fucking banker after all . " Sounds like a waste of time , " he said , then turned away from my stare . His little jab stung more than it should have . Normally I do n't care what people think , but lately , looking at the world through a refracted lens , viewing the worth of places and people and objects in terms of light and shadow , black and white , was n't as satisfying as it used to be . Restless , I had recently begun taking more self-portraits than anything else ; zeroing in on singular things like my knuckles , constantly red and callused from nylon punching bags , or my eyes-right or left , rarely both-which were tawny and earth-colored during the day , but blackened like a clouded lake in the dark , or when I was extremely angry . Instead of looking for enemies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera on myself , and I did n't need Freud or even Dr. Phil to tell me I was searching for something . Question was , would I like what I eventually found ? " Banking , on the other hand , " I began sweetly , once the server had delivered our entres , " sounds absolutely captivating . Please do n't skip one fascinating little detail . " Ajax 's mouth creased even thinner than his hairline . " God , I should have known by looking that you 're nothing like your sister . " I did n't really consider it an insult , but I was sure my eyes had gone black as tar . " And how , exactly , do you know what my sister 's like ? " " I read her profile in Playboy , " he said nastily , and shoved some saffron potatoes into his mouth . In turn , I settled my own fork on the side of my plate . So that was it . Though similar in build , Olivia and I had taken vastly different approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was referring to had come out three months earlier , and while I did n't approve of Olivia 's overt approach to sexuality , I understood the reason behind it . Ironically enough , it stemmed from the same origin as my own .
