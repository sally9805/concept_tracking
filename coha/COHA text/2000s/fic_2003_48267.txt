When his wife told him to get out of the house that had been hers , anyway , long before they were married , Valdek Moore looked in the paper and found a semi-furnished one-bedroom at Linden Pines . The development 's name suggested an estate of elegant foliage , right for a term of penance , when it was really a clearing shaved into the scrubby flats of East Providence . Eight uninspired multi-unit townhouses were studded around a circle of asphalt while the noose of the cul-de-sac hung north of Route 6 . On his first night in the single bed that still held the shape of its previous tenant , Valdek had felt a lift at having pioneered himself , at thirty years old , to a place he could never have imagined he 'd end up . But by the next morning , what was new to him was already too old , and he came to the uneasy conclusion that Linden Pines was where people lived only because they had nowhere else to go , and for now , the same was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valdek had kept himself apart from his neighbors , but he knew some of their names from the cluster of mailboxes ; there was Vasquez , Davis , Stahl , Peterlin , Lenning , Chin who lived above him with two poodles , and Mazelli whose uncurtained , sex-show bedroom window faced Valdek 's over a narrow strip of knotty grass land-mined with dog turds . There was also the Molotovas , and on this October afternoon , he saw the daughter struggle to hang a string of Halloween pumpkin lights around her front door . A few times he 'd said hello to her and the innocuous what 's up because she was fourteen at most , he guessed , pretty in an underfed , impermanent way , and always alone . He remembered girls like her on the fringe from his own high school days , rumors floating about them like auras , and their eager faces irresistible targets for rejection . Valdek leaned against the sun-warmed mailboxes and watched her , absorbed by how she tried over and over to loop the wire around a nail that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white plastic chair warped under her , how her tight jeans turned a lighter blue when she stretched . <p> Hers was a child 's compulsion , he decided ; she refused to believe that what she wanted was not going to happen . On a day with not much else to do , it was strangely compelling to witness . <p> " Hey , " she yelled , and gestured for Valdek to cross the asphalt towards her . " Hey , you . Can you help me ? " <p> There was no one else out in Linden Pines , there never was , and she called to him again . It was clear then that she 'd known he 'd been watching , and that she 'd been performing for him all along . Valdek turned , pretending not to hear her or see the way she waved like a woman flagging a passing bus as he retreated inside his dim apartment . He felt a little bad for ditching her , but he should n't have been staring in the first place ; it was creepy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . He had n't meant to provoke any connection in this place-invisibility was like being in a deep , timeless freeze-he 'd only been looking for a letter or anything from Frances , and his gaze had strayed . His face , with his mother 's downward , foreign Slovak eyes and his father 's wide American mouth always up at the corners , had been misinterpreted , and his long legs in black jeans and his empty hands had looked like the solution to the girl 's wire-and-nail dilemma . He waited until she 'd gone inside before he escaped to the hulking movie octoplex on Route 6 . It was light when he left his apartment , and black when he wandered out of the theater , and for a few minutes in the disorientation of the dark he could n't find his car . He had a feeling that he could be anywhere in the country at that moment , and still never know exactly where he was . Linden Pines , his neighbors , and the Molotova girl , he told himself as he wandered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to learn . He 'd be leaving too soon for that . Frances , Franny , Fran , his wife of three years , she was his vocabulary , a taste of regret , but still sweet on his tongue . <p> Valdek 's lower-level job at the Narragansett Animal Shelter was half a mile from the hospital where Frances , at forty-three , was Chief of Pediatrics , and one block from the Ocean State Family Planning Clinic and its chronic rash of protestors . Every morning , he drove by the same fervent group on the corner of Point and Friendship streets , and though there was never any acknowledgement between them , Valdek hated his affinity with these people . But there it was , undeniable like the ever-expanding city behind them ; they both spent their energy on things no one else wanted , and the caustic odor of euthanasia hung over all of them . <p> On this Friday , he was tempted to keep going towards the hospital to catch sight of Frances . He 'd been sure the week , their fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it had n't , and he felt beaten down for having confused wanting something for believing it would happen . It made him think of the Molotova girl again , and how her chair was still lying in the grass in a gesture of disgust . The car radio predicted rain , and as he took the turn , Valdek saw that the sky was already a tossing violet , not right for so early in the day . His view flashed black and white suddenly , and he stood up tall on the brakes . A hooded protestor in a white rain poncho waved her poster with its picture of a fetus , faded like a water stain , in front of his windshield . <p> " You come barreling around this corner now like there 's no one here , " she scolded , and rapped his hood with her knuckles . " And we 're always here . When are you going to learn ? " <p> A joke came to mind as her poncho whispered ghost-like against his car : What 's black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else he might say to her , left breathless and wide-eyed by the near miss , but he pictured at that moment pinning her up against the chain-link fence in front of Three Aces Lighting , his bumper at her knees . When he pulled into his building 's yard a few minutes later , his hands were still murderous on the steering wheel , so he reminded himself of the mission for all who entered the animal shelter : to promote humane principles , stop cruelty , and alleviate fear . Already that morning , he had n't done so well , and his heart flipped against his ribs . <p> An hour later , he got up from his desk where he 'd been filling out an order slip for dog food to collect the first school group of the day-second-graders from Spenser Avenue . His co-workers had chosen to devote their lives to working with animals , they did n't especially like kids , and so they 'd gladly added this particular task to Valdek 's collection of others . He 'd seen these men and women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense when tiny palms covered tiny noses at the smell of turds dropped in terror , seen how they stiffened when sticky hands stroked fur in the wrong direction . Valdek understood the kids ' impulses better because they were more often his , and was n't it cruel , he often asked Frances , to tell kids not to touch what was most touchable ? After all , he 'd met her in this very building during that long August she 'd decided it was time to pine for a dog-because she 'd given up on ever having a baby-and ended up taking him home instead . He 'd fallen in love with her slightly defeated confidence , the body and face she did n't much like , and how she 'd looked at him like he was her last chance . <p> But he was a contagion to Frances these days , a man who 'd had sex once with a woman who was n't his wife , banished from the house , the dirtiest of all dogs . My mission , Valdek intoned again as he pushed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of companion animals and our responsibilities to them . <p> He gathered the second-graders , gave them his standard speech , tapping for effect the plastic tag on his breast pocket identifying him for the hour as Educator . He detected frozen waffles and the usual anxiety on their breath . Valdek walked backwards through the canyon of cages , the phalanx of kids following him . A fortyish teacher in front matched his steps so that they performed a kind of touchless tango . He moved to his left , she to her right with a smile that suggested she liked the way he looked . He heard the synthetic catch of her blouse over her bra , smelled her dry-cleaning , morning shampoo , and flowery deodorant , and his stomach tightened and his prick roused . Since he 'd strayed from the path of the good husband , sometimes what was least erotic turned him on , and he feared that his ultimate punishment was to end up a pervert , here among animals and children and teachers . He stuffed his hands into his pockets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the line , a barrel-chested teacher gave him an impatient glance and corralled the kids forward . He was familiar but unplaceable , as though Valdek had seen the expression but not the face . The man 's blue nylon jacket identified him as a member of a small society-weeknight bowlers , or a bar league maybe , or men who work with children , that slightly embarrassed fraternity . Soon , Valdek felt the group 's ebbing of interest and the start of an inevitable surge flow through the children , the twitching and flexing of fingers , like the rustle to flight of small birds . <p> " No touching , " he reminded them . " Hands in . You do n't know the dogs , and they do n't know you , no matter how nice you are , no matter how many of you have pets at home . Now , how many of you think that cats really have nine lives ? " <p> They looked at him expectantly , especially the teacher at the front , but did they really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , he wondered , that if you stick a finger in a caged dog 's face he wo n't actually try to bite it off ? He and Fran had seen it happen at the Phoenix airport last Christmas when they 'd gone to visit her parents . The wail of the biter and the bitten were indistinguishable in the overcrowded terminal , and it had thrown Fran into a slump on a plastic chair , her thin knees tipped together helplessly . Christ , she 'd said , I 'm supposed to know the difference between pain and fear . The place on a holiday was full of babies being shown off to giddy , retired grandparents , and Valdek knew that this was what had really sunk his still baby-less wife . He did n't know what to say to Fran ( though the thought that she was old enough to be a grandmother herself had occurred to him , unwelcome as an attack of food poisoning ) , and he focused instead on two planes that seemed inadvisably to lift off at once . <p> Halfway down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form into a fist , that sly and beautiful packaging of thumb across knuckles . The kid reached out , but instead of a fist , inserted a finger between the bars of one of the cages . He had chosen the easiest of targets in the lethargic beagle , but the dog sprung forward in its final defense and growled in a demented , despairing way . Valdek grabbed the boy 's arm and squeezed it hard , tightening his grip through denim jacket and Disney World sweatshirt until the kid let out a wail . <p> " Do n't ever do that again , " he said , seized by some fury he did n't recognize . " Did n't I just tell you to keep your hands in ? You want to lose a finger ? " He was stopped by the boy 's sudden springing up of tears-proof , like blood , of how deep he 'd cut the kid . He was both acutely present-the feel of the boy 's breath on his face ! - and oddly absent ; this was n't him . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agitated circles , while the teacher behind him breathed through her bright teeth , scared of her own bad judgment when it came to handsome men . Valdek quickly swept the group into the education room , and shut the door . When he 'd figured out what to say , how to apologize , he would go in there and bring as an offering an old mutt the kids could sweetly molest . But for now , in the foyer just outside , he kneeled by the ancient beagle . The dog looked past him , vacant and dumb , one incisor wandering over the black lip . <p> " Hey . I want to talk to you . " The teacher who had been at the back of the group came into the foyer . He sniffed loudly , the equivalent of a finger jabbed in Valdek 's chest . " You overreacted back there , " he said . " Big time . " He had a booming voice , too loud for the space . <p> Valdek did n't look up as he worked at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new deathly scattering of them . " I 'd just warned the kids not to touch , " he said . " The boy could have lost his finger . " <p> " Not likely . The dog 's half dead , anyway . " <p> Valdek tapped the Educator tag on his shirt , his plastic shield of authority , if only for the moment . " Very likely , in fact . " <p> " Bottom line : you do n't ever put your hands on my kids . " The man paused to recollect his anger , and bounced on the balls of his feet in bright running shoes . " Understand ? " <p> " Bottom line : do n't threaten me . The animals and the children are my responsibility when you 're in this building . " <p> " Obviously , you 're not safe around kids . " <p> Valdek rose to look his accuser in the eye . He 'd never been in a fistfight before , but he knew he 'd do it now , even outweighed as he was . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea of the two of them , teachers , nose-wipers and dog-food procurers , flailing away at each other made Valdek laugh . The man was puzzled , wondering if he was being made fun of , and then his face turned hard and menacing . The expression was suddenly so familiar it was as though Valdek had always known it . This fearsome aggressor , this unlikely protector of children and virtue , was Mazelli who lived in the next unit at Linden Pines . This was the man who screwed his wife with an efficient and cold enthusiasm , a nasty show Valdek had watched too often since moving in . <p> There was no sign of recognition on the other man 's part when he said , " I 'm going to report you . Get ready to look for a new job , you piece of shit . " <p> And it 's your bare , ugly ass I see every night , Valdek thought , but he knew it was completely useless knowledge , and that he was in trouble . <p> When Mazelli and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some eye contact of apology with the boy , the unfortunate player who might be a player still if he continued to cry , but the kid refused to look at him through the downpour that had finally arrived . <p> Since he 'd moved into Linden Pines , Valdek had begun to notice that the buildings appeared to huddle closer to each other the later it got . It was as if the days cast an obligatory , gray indifference over the place-the freedom to hide and ignore your fellow tenant was written into every lease , he imagined , like the instructions to haul one 's own garbage-that packed up and went home when it got dark . Lights went on around the circle in a kind of assumed obedience , car doors shut , occasionally there was a disembodied voice , or the unmistakable crackle of a plastic grocery bag being lugged up the stairs . And that week , after his encounter with Mazelli , Valdek 's window seemed to be a little closer to the other man 's every day . As he watched the sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always a teacher 's routine , fucking on weeknights between eight and eleven , scheduled in like library , lunch , and recess . It was 9:20 as Mazelli parked his small wife 's feet on his shoulders and levered her hips off the bed . Valdek had never seen the woman 's face , night or day , but he could tell even in the cheap erotic glow of a red light bulb that she was as passive as an orchid . Mazelli was all cock and chest , his unbuttoned flannel shirt billowing behind him like he was a pantless ship 's captain . His concentrated face with eyes rolling back turned occasionally toward the window , but he never saw Valdek there . When he was finished , Mazelli dusted his wife 's legs off his shoulders , and she rolled complicitly onto her side , the crack of her ass straight as defeat . How could she tolerate him ? Valdek felt not at all excited by what he 'd seen-limp , in fact , in brain and body-but only sorry and vaguely humiliated for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and considered phoning Frances . He would n't tell her about his neighbor 's lousy technique , because what could she say-at least he has a wife ? But he would tell her that at the moment he was watching the Molotova girl 's pumpkin lights-when and how she 'd gotten them strung up finally , he did n't know-short out from the rain in a series of exuberant sparks and small explosions . Fran would laugh when he explained that Linden Pines was the kind of place where parents encouraged their kids to fool around with electricity and water . Finally , he 'd confess to her how he 'd grabbed the kid at work , and how he might lose his job because of it , how every day he expected it to happen , march right into his office and do him in . Frances might be sympathetic in a professional , imprecise way , but she 'd have no sympathy for him specifically , and then what would he say ? <p> He recalled , with a shame that was still remarkably unfaded , the conference he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wore a ( tarnished ) silver cat pin on her brown jacket . Valdek had told the woman he liked her jewelry , and it was this dumb lie that had made him so aggressive and mercenary . She was young , too easily flattered and flustered by his looks and cruel smoothness , and he 'd maneuvered her into the Sheraton 's dark corner next to where the tongue of the escalator lay exhausted on the lowest level . It was one of those melancholy , defeated spaces where bad things happen , garbage collects , and drunks piss , unbearable in its uselessness to a man who knows he 's become useless to his wife . Anger and sorrow had turned him on in bed with her , and then made him sick by the time Frances picked him up at the Amtrak station the next night . He confessed while they were still parked , the new mall glowing like an imitation jewel at the end of the avenue , and she wiped at her tears behind her glasses . He knew that it was what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him-that was so devastating for her , and not the act itself . In the end , there was no baby he 'd been able to give her to assure her that she 'd ever made a single good choice in her whole life . <p> Valdek looked up to see a woman cross the circle in an impatient trot , her shoulders lifted against inconvenience , the rain , and Chin out with his dogs . He wondered why she was out at all , what , or who she needed . From behind , she looked like the Molotova girl , but her body was a little more tired , and she passed by the dead pumpkin lights without seeming to notice or care that they 'd gone dark . There was life in this place , Valdek admitted to himself , and as he drank another beer , he heard the lines of connection tighten across the air and his chest . <p> " The guy put this in the wrong mailbox , " the Molotova girl told Valdek when he opened his door one morning . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was thick from too many drinks out with a friend . " This is you , right ? " <p> She read his name off the envelope , the sound of it surprising in her mouth . To Valdek , any envelope with his name on it these days was a scary thing , possibly containing accusations and demanding accountability , but when he saw it was from Frances , finally , he felt instantly lifted off the floor . The word saved whispered in his ear . But he also saw that while she 'd gotten the address of Linden Pines right , she had the unit number wrong . It was an easy mistake to make , but enormously discouraging . Valdek knew that this was the slipping knowledge of the small but essential facts of another person 's life , slipping that would go on until there was nothing real or true left . He was fully awake now , firmly in his hungover body , his two feet on the slick wall-to-wall , and suddenly very aware of the girl who was shivering in the chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hands , bright with cheap gold rings , moved in and out of her sleeves . She was prettier this close , with an assessing gaze that made him look away so that his eyes caught on the significant swell of her breasts under her yellow fleece . <p> " Your place is exactly like mine , " she announced , having stepped fully into the apartment and run her eyes over everything in it . " But they 're all alike , I guess . " She looked out the window at her own unit . " Decorations help-that way you always know which one is yours , especially at night when they really look the same . I got my little pumpkin lights up finally . No thanks to you , by the way . " <p> She moved through the room with an air of suggestion and entitlement that was part woman-how she brushed his things with her fingertips-and part child , as if her parents had never told her a single cautionary tale about going into the apartments of strange men . Uneasy with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of yesterday 's coffee and Franny 's envelope in front of him . <p> " I 'm Lena , " she said , with an odd assertiveness . " Lena and Valdek . " She lifted her hands in front of her face and thought for a second . " Kedlav and Anel . That 's us backwards . " She looked longingly at the drink he moved to his mouth , as though she wanted not just it , but insatiably , everything she laid her eyes on . He sensed there was something decidedly off and needy about the girl ; she was both compelling and , if he were smart , to be avoided . <p> " I do n't drink coffee , " she told him . " Not usually , anyway . My mom was born in Russia . We drink tea . " <p> " Want some tea , then ? " he offered , but she shook her head . <p> Lena sat on the arm of the couch that another tenant 's nervousness had scratched bare . She told him that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph 's Hospital , that she slept during the day , and that she 'd just gotten a used Impala . The girl spilled facts carelessly , whisking them around with her glittering hands , and they piled up in front of Valdek , thin and of unclear intent . <p> " So what about your father ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't have one . I mean , obviously I do , but I do n't know where . " Lena glanced at the low ceiling as Chin 's dogs raced back and forth . " I see those dogs all the time , you know . He lets them poop on the grass , and he does n't clean it up . You should say something . " <p> " Why should I say something ? How about you ? " <p> " Because he lives in your unit . " She kicked her heels at the side of the couch , smug with her understanding of the rules that he clearly lacked . " And you should put something up on the walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No offense . " <p> " I 'm not staying very long . " <p> " You 're leaving ? " Lena seemed disappointed for a second and then gave him a flirtatious but skeptical look . " Yeah , sure . We 'll see about that . " <p> " I 'm married , " he said . " Actually , I have a house in Providence . This is just for a little bit . " He was surprised at his impulse to tell her anything or speak any part of his life-true or not-but the need to announce that he would n't always be in Linden Pines , that there was somewhere else he needed to be , was suddenly overpowering . " We 're working some things out . " <p> Lena shrugged . " Well , my mother happens to think this is the greatest place on earth . " Her pounding heels drove home her disdain of the notion . " She 's fucked , though . " <p> " What do you know about Mazelli , the guy who lives- " <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " He 's a pig . " She laughed , and a faint discoloring crept up her neck . Did she also watch him at night ? " He 's a teacher , something like that . " She hesitated . " So , what else do you want to know ? " <p> Nothing , he told her . He did n't know how she knew anything when all he ever saw in Linden Pines were fragments of interaction so brief and strange he sometimes thought he 'd imagined them . Unless of course , he realized , they happened just like this-inside , undetectable , and unreal . Lena picked up yesterday 's paper from the floor and began to read as though it were something she did in his place all the time . <p> He opened Fran 's envelope , slicing the seam with a kitchen knife . There was only a piece of paper wrapped around a business card with her lawyer 's name and number on it . What was there to haggle over ? Her money and her house were always hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And soon I will be divorced , he told himself ; she wo n't take me back . A dizziness crept up his spine and lodged at the back of his head . <p> " You have to leave , " Valdek said suddenly to Lena . His teeth felt ice cold against his tongue . <p> " God . What 's your problem ? " <p> " Thanks for my mail , but you have to go now . " <p> The girl unfolded herself from the couch in a yawn of inconvenience , and the newspaper returned to the floor , open to what she 'd been reading , a bright ad for a giant toy sale of picnic tables , baby pools , inflatable chairs . She left his apartment , and he saw how she lingered in front of Mazelli 's as though she were trying to decide whether to go there next . From the way she slipped her hands into her sleeves and held herself , Valdek knew there was nowhere she had to be . And if she needed something from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Mazelli and his wife going at it as usual , Valdek remembered the way Lena had pointed over her shoulder towards the man as though she owned him and all of Linden Pines . <p> * * * <p> On Halloween , Valdek watched Lena with her drooping shopping bag move clockwise around the circle . He 'd had only three other kids all evening , and when she 'd reached into his bowl of candy , he 'd known it was her behind the Betty Rubble mask by her hand of confused jewelry-a claddagh ring , a gothic serpent with glass eyes , a tiny gold-plated ankh on her thumb-but neither of them said anything . She went inside her apartment and a few minutes later reappeared in a different mask , something rubbery and unidentifiable , and walked towards him . <p> " I 've seen you before , " he said to Lena . " Is n't this called double-dipping ? " She looked at him through ragged rubber eyeholes and then lifted the mask from her flushed face and rested it on her head . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't you a little old for this ? Do n't you have some friends to hang out with ? " <p> " It 's just a goof , " she said , defensively . " There 's nothing better to do . " She unwrapped a lollipop and put it in her mouth . " I 'm stuck here , as usual . I 'm a loser , just like you . " <p> " Do n't hold back , " he said . " Tell me exactly what you think . " <p> The candy moved inside her cheek like a dreaming eye . " I thought you were moving . " <p> For the first time since he 'd come to Linden Pines , Valdek could hear the grind of traffic on Route 6 through the denuded trees . It seemed a bad night to be alone . " So , where 's your mother tonight ? " <p> " I told you already , she works nights . Anyway , she does n't get Halloween at all , thinks it 's totally weird that people dress up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are broken ? I know she did something to them . I 'm so mad at her . " Two lines , like tiny blades , appeared in her forehead . " I hate her . " <p> It seemed almost cruel now to tell her about the natural conspiracies of weather that had caused her lights to spark out . They were just inches inside the narrow doorway , Lena with her tough-girl stance , when the lights in Mazelli 's apartment went on . Lena caught her breath just as he caught his . Valdek stepped back from Mazelli 's view , and she stepped in and almost against him . He had his reasons for hiding , but was shocked to see a shade of the deepest unhappiness fall across her face . Her fingers twisted tightly in the handles of her bag , her eyes became platinum with tears , and she seemed at that moment entirely lost . He did n't know why exactly , if it was talk of her sabotaged lights , or her depressingly un-American mother , or if it was some acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how long it took me to get the lights up ? And now they do n't work ? Why did n't you help me that day ? " she demanded . <p> It was a moment of chilling clarity for Valdek : the pure human sound of her misery , the cold air in his nose , the perfect peak of the roof above them . He did n't want his life to be just circumstances and aftershocks anymore , and knew he could turn Lena away then , or not , and that a choice was a rare and beautiful thing . <p> " I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm not very good with children . " She snorted in agreement . " Let me take you to the shelter where I work . We 'll go see the animals . " He knew this was reckless , that you did n't put girls in your car and drive them away . Lena 's mother might be careless with her daughter , leaving her alone all night , but he would n't be . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but already he knew she would . <p> It was n't until they were halfway to Providence that Valdek realized he was n't heading towards work at all , but towards Fran 's house on Lyman Street . He steered with one light finger , the mood lifting and buoying with the moon . Lena 's chatter and the careless scent of candy filled the car . He 'd never seen anyone eat the stuff the way she did , clicking it against her teeth and letting the wrappers collect at her feet . When they had reached the highest span on the Red Bridge and reflections of the city lights drifted in the water , Lena did n't notice . Valdek glanced at her knees drawn up and parted , at her thin , too tight pants , at her sneakers resting on the dashboard , and wondered what she was looking at if not the lights . He felt an urge to touch Lena 's tangled hair , her hand , even the rubber mask on the seat between them . <p> " Your mother leaves you alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to . Besides , everyone knows . " <p> " Everyone knows what ? " <p> " If something happens . " <p> " If something happens , " Valdek repeated . <p> He was tempted to ask her , this girl who got into the car of a man she did n't know , what she imagined that something might be , but they 'd arrived at Lyman Street by then , and he parked in front of Fran 's house . Even in the dark Valdek saw that it was in the process of being repainted and repaired . A group of kids in costumes waited at the front door , and when Frances did n't answer , they moved on . He imagined his wife , no great fan of the holiday , staying late at the hospital and checking her watch so she 'd know when it was safe to go home again . <p> She had torn down the rose bushes that sometimes caught on her sweaters , replaced the feisty vines with a row of tight-assed boxwoods and the sagging fence with a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the place always needed a hundred repairs , and the idea of selling had sat like a dented can at the back of the cabinet , one that 's too old to use but ca n't quite be thrown out . When they 'd met , Frances had already lived there for ten years ; she had a history with it , like her old lovers . It seemed to Valdek now that he had entered one door , and then she 'd let him out by another . It made him feel as though he 'd died . <p> " This is where you work ? " Lena asked , sitting up in her seat . " This is where the animals are ? " <p> " No , this is where my wife lives . " <p> Lena was undeterred by the detour . " My mom would die to live here , " she said . " She 's fixing it up , your wife , I mean , before you come back . " <p> Valdek was touched by her attempt to tell him what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivated by the activity outside while the two of them were locked inside watching . " Want to get some more candy as long as we 're here ? " <p> She was tireless and drawn to the houses with the brightest , biggest decorations , sure of her passions and bluntly acquisitive of everything , furniture seen through open doors , pets , children , potted plants , even the shoes a man had on . He wondered if she imagined her future decorated with the stuff . The people who had been his neighbors cast cool glances at Lena , and something only a little less chilly at him . What must it have looked like to them when he moved in with Fran , the woman who 'd previously joked to anyone that Oops , I forgot to get married and have children ? They would not have imagined that this marriage , older woman to younger man , money to nothing , was something that was going to last , so would they have even noticed when he left ? <p> " Let 's go see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candy . " <p> " We will , I promise . " Valdek began to walk towards Fran 's backyard . " I just want to see one thing first . " <p> What had Frances done with the land ? There had been mounds of nature before ; a squirrel skull lodged in the soil , a patch of genitalia-like mushrooms that sprouted after too much rain . Valdek had grown tomatoes , and a summer ago , he 'd presented the first ripe one to Frances , who 'd eaten it with salt . She 'd claimed it was an act of faith to grow food within sight of the skyline , the train station , and the housing projects , and he liked that he 'd succeeded at something she 'd always assumed was impossible . <p> Now the ground was flat and pounded hard , the bushes cleared , and the view sharper than before . Lena leaned against the fence and stared at the city , her neck arching above the collar of her puffy coat . Valdek knew from the way she urged herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was something disquieting about her pleasure . Minutes before , he had put on her mask to make her laugh , and now he knew that the taste in his mouth , an earthy peppermint , was her breath that had condensed there . <p> He forced down a speeding , erotic current in his body . Suddenly , he wanted to get away from the girl in his wife 's yard , and climbed a stage of scaffolding on the back corner of the house where some clapboards and a small square of roofing were being repaired . He 'd always suspected that this spot was the source of the leak that bloomed on the ceiling above the bed where he and Franny slept . In the damp , it was prone to rashes of mold , while in the summer , it peeled like her sunburned shoulders . He 'd never done anything about it because its repair never seemed urgent . But it had bothered Frances a lot , apparently ; he was barely out of the house before she had it fixed . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his cheek to the house and inhaled the scent of new paint . The zipper of his jacket pinged against the metal scaf-folding . <p> Valdek looked into Fran 's bedroom . On the other side of the door , a ladder blocked the hallway where the paper was half-stripped . What he saw was that Frances had n't bothered to push it back to accommodate her life , to say I still live here and you 're just a temporary inconvenience . Instead , she must have squeezed around it every time , as though she was n't really there for this undoing-this erasing of the time she 'd been with Valdek-but she 'd be back for the redoing , the reclaiming of her old life . It seemed to him then that his sleeping with the other woman had given Frances an easy way out of a marriage whose terms he had n't entirely understood . " You should come down , " Lena said . " You could fall or something . " <p> He glanced below to see her face offered up to him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , Franny , he whispered , let me in ; am I not enough for you ? Lena sat on the grass and bent her head towards her chest , her legs straight in front of her . She flexed her feet and pulled at her toes , tilting herself into a triangle so that her body levered off the perfect turf of the yard . And Valdek knew looking down at her then that Mazelli did n't have a wife at all . Mazelli had Lena . <p> " Can we go now ? " she called up . <p> He did n't know how he 'd missed what was so clear ; the lines of her body in Mazelli 's bed that were the same lines he 'd watched as she hung her lights , the arching of her arms when she wanted something impossible , how she 'd dodged the man 's view earlier . He knew he was only reaching into the air when he took a step , and still he did it . Valdek saw the house rise above him , then the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back . His heels and fingers wedged into the ground . The scaffolding knocked against the house . <p> " Are you all right ? " Lena crouched by him . " I told you that would happen . " His head ached , and his spine felt encased in ice . " She 's going to see you lying here , and she 'll never want you then . " <p> The girl was beautiful in her sympathy for him , and her hand with those rings hovering over his chest was a gesture more intimate than he 'd ever seen her make with Mazelli . <p> " Your mother should n't leave you alone at night . " He touched her cheek . She was pure sorrow . " You 're too young . " <p> She felt her face where he had . When she stood , she was unsteady , her self-possession gone . " Stop saying that . I 'm sixteen . Can we go now ? If you 're not dead or paralyzed , then will you get up ? " <p> Later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molotovas ' apartment , he recalled how Lena had fallen asleep in the car on the way to the shelter . He 'd touched her hand curled on the seat , surprised to find how chapped her skin was , like a boy 's . Her eyes had been distant with disorientation , and she stood close to him as he unlocked the shelter door . <p> Inside , the smell of mournful animal had been hot and meaty , and she 'd put her hand over her nose as he 'd led her past the cages to his office , where he 'd had the old beagle sleep every night since the day he 'd grabbed the boy and squeezed his arm . <p> " Is this one yours ? " Lena had asked . " Pretty sad-looking dog . " <p> Valdek had hoped the dog would die there , drowned under the weight of her own tumors and far from the horror of a cage . The animal had been brought in a while back because she 'd bitten someone ; she was no companion animal . Valdek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Mazelli was likely to be too powerless in his own guilt to accuse him of anything . ( He could n't do right by the boy he 'd hurt ; that was a scar . ) Lena had touched the folds at the dog 's neck , but an animal is nothing to a girl who sleeps with men , Valdek had thought . She 'd looked at him then , confused and tired , and as on the day he 'd been caught staring at her , it was clear she knew exactly what he understood . And was n't she asking for his help now ? <p> Valdek knew that if he watched , maybe not that night , but the next , he would see Lena with Mazelli again . He would call the police , report the rape of a child going on , and watch as they dragged the man 's ass out of the apartment , his pants puddling around his ankles like humiliation . <p> Valdek rang the bell and waited as the string of pumpkin lights scratched back and forth against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the inches between chain and door . For a moment , he thought he was looking at Lena ; a dimmer light would n't reveal the lines , the older skin and eyes that made mother different from daughter . Behind her , the television was on , and the sliver of room was discouragingly just like his . <p> " Yes ? " she said . <p> " I live there , " he told her . He glanced back at his own black doorway . It was almost two a.m. , the dark still had a forbidding hold on the place , but if this woman thought his appearance at this hour was strange , or even frightening , she did n't show it . That she 'd answered at all surprised him , but she was incautious like her daughter . <p> " I know . Do you want something ? " He heard the bedrock of her foreign accent . <p> " I know your daughter , " he told her . " I want to tell you what 's going on . That man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not here . " <p> The woman 's fingers curled around the door . " No , she 's here , asleep . " <p> " Not now , " he said . " When you 're at work . She goes to him . " <p> " She 's upstairs . " She gave him a dull , puzzled look , and her shoulders lifted in a familiar way . He remembered a woman crossing the circle in the rain . <p> " No , when you 're not here . " His voice rose in frustration . He 'd begun to scare her , and she moved her weight against the door , the inches narrowing . " Do you understand what I 'm saying ? That man is sleeping with her . " <p> " Go away . We 're asleep now . " Her head shook with a tiny tremor , but he could tell from how she averted her eyes and defiantly retained her right as a non-native speaker to misunderstand what she wanted that she already knew all of this . Lena 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a night of body . It occurred to Valdek that Mazelli paid for all of it . People made bargains and used each other all the time , hopeful and willfully blind , and this was just one of them . He and Frances had made another ; the terms had been clear enough . <p> There was n't anything more to say to Lena 's mother-though for the briefest moment he considered the geometry of being with her , of moving in-and she pushed the door shut . Valdek knew there were a thousand other places he might live now . It seemed both a lonely and invigorating truth . In the meantime , he 'd bang on his window until Mazelli finally saw him , just to let the man know he was there watching . <p>
