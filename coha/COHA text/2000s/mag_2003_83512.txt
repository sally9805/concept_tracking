As a five-year-old fond of standing on a milk crate to inspect her father 's car engine , Kelly Sutton was happiest  --  in the pit-stop poetry of her mother , Carol  --  " in the garage , getting greazy. " // Her big sister , Tracey , wanted to be a cheerleader , but Kelly became , oxymoronically , a feminine tomboy , part lipstick , part dipstick , who first rode a minibike at age nine , broke her right leg on one at 10 and was transfixed  --  at 11 , in 1982  --  by the motion picture Six Pack , in which Kenny Rogers plays a NASCAR driver who adopts , as his mechanics , six irrepressible orphans . // At 12 , Kelly , an adolescent Eva Knievel , had the first of five surgeries on her right leg and then contracted meningitis , for which she spent 11 days in the hospital . A year later , after crashing her motorcycle behind the Sutton house in Crownsville , Md. , she was found facedown by her father , Ed , who reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her CPR. // When Kelly could speak again , she reiterated her ambition to become a NASCAR driver and one day race on the world-famous tri-oval at Daytona International Speedway . Which is when Fate pulled the hand brake on her life . Kelly , who normally went zero to 60 in six seconds , now did the opposite . She came home from school and went straight to bed . She felt exhausted for days and then weeks and then months on end . She was variously described by doctors as depressed , attention-starved and enduring puberty . // Still , as a member of a mission group at church , Kelly regularly visited her bedridden neighbor , Miss Carmen , who was painfully immobilized with multiple sclerosis . A few months after Miss Carmen died , Kelly saw a neurologist , whose diagnosis of her condition was not depression but MS . She was told she had eight to 10 years to walk before spending the remainder of her life in a wheelchair . Kelly , 16 , thought immediately of Miss Carmen . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted it as fact . " // But the neurologist was wrong . Kelly did n't have eight to 10 years to walk . She had one . With five months remaining in her senior year of high school , the right side of her body gone numb , Kelly became housebound , missing the prom and hoarding all her energy for a new kind of triumph : walking across the stage of her high school auditorium on graduation day to accept her diploma . " That ? says Carol through tears all these years later , " was a great moment . " // With a wheelchair waiting , Kelly began to live in double time . She married and gave birth to a daughter , Ashlee . When Kelly 's father asked if she still wanted to race cars , he added , before she could say no , " We 'll do it before anything else happens to you . " They bought a Mini-Stock car , and when Kelly 's MS  --  the relapsing-remitting type , the least aggressive form of the disease-temporarily abated , she entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt instantly at home . Kelly Sutton , who had previously raced only go-karts , finished , improbably , fourth . In the next three years she was voted , each season , the Most Popular Driver on the Pro Mini-Stock circuit . // By 1995 she was poised , impossibly , to race at Daytona , as a driver in the Goody 's Dash Series , which races a lighter , V-6 version of Winston Cup cars . One week before she was to do so , while driving to her parents ' house in Crownsville , going about 60 mph in her ' 89 Camaro , Kelly skidded on ice , hit a tree , collapsed a lung , broke ribs , dislocated a hip and shoulder , went into shock and unintentionally unleashed all the furies of her disease . // At 24 she had to be held up in the shower and placed on the toilet . Says Carol , " She could n't close her own eyes . " Kelly endured this for a full year with a dignity that was both heartbreaking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to attend Ashlee 's softball games , where she 'd lay supine , beneath a blanket , on a chaise longue lawn chair , a disembodied voice shouting encouragement to her daughter . // All the while Ed was building a metal box with a steering wheel weighted to 70 pounds of resistance on which he painted racing colors , Kelly 's number 01 and her name . " You need to work out on this , " he said , delivering it to her house one day . " You 're gon na race again . " // In 1997 , her disease dormant once more , Kelly returned to racing and made it all the way up to the Allison Legacy Series . She also began to wait tables at Chick &amp; Ruth 's , a famous Annapolis deli with pictures of movie stars and presidents on the wall . And in 1998 she discovered a drug that has , for four years now , kept her MS manageable . What 's more , the drug 's manufacturer , Teva Pharmaceuticals , offered to sponsor her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race of 2003 is on Sunday , at Daytona , where last week in practice Kelly , now number 02 , recorded the fastest lap in a nondrafting session , averaging 163.705 mph . She is favored to be the first woman ever to win the pole in a race at Daytona , to say nothing of the first driver with MS . Her photo now hangs among the celebrity glossies at Chick &amp; Ruth's. // Of her remarkable existence , racing with scarlet fingernails , Kelly says , " It 's everything I imagined it to be as a little girl . " // The doctors , of course , were right : At 31 , Kelly Sutton 's life is largely confined to a wheeled chair .
