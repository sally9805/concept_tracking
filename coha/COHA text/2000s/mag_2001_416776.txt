Vulnerable , nurturing , battle-worn but triumphant , the Greek goddesses in Marilyn Pappas 's Muses series are powerful , poignant commentaries on the strength and resiliency of the human spirit , and of women in particular . Headless , often with severed limbs and battered breasts , these goddesses are glorious and heroic in their imperfection , like the venerable stone statues that inspired them . Densely stitched in monochromatic colors and gold against a linen background , these portraits have a voluptuous quality that infuses the subjects with life . Pappas uses her embroidery skill and eye for perspective to create the illusion of depth and movement . In Nike of Samothrace with Golden Wing , 2001 , the goddess looks as if she 's perched on the prow of a ship , the voluminous folds of her garment blowing against her body , her luminous golden wing stretched out behind her . Iris , 1995-96 ( remounted 1998 ) , despite being limbless and headless , is the essence of exuberant movement as Pappas captures her mid-leap .

" I think that by putting the images of these statues back into linen - supposedly the fabric depicted in the statues-I emphasize their femininity , " Pappas says . " And that 's important to me . I 'm also interested in the notion that the body represents nature and the drapery refers to culture , and that together they create a graceful balance . " Pappas , whose studio is in Somerville , Massachusetts , is able to coax subtle emotions out of the statues , which she reveals in the body posture and hand positioning of the stitched versions . " I think I have a dialogue with the statues in my head , " Pappas says with a smile , " and by a process of osmosis they suggest things to me . " In Fragment of Athena with Golden Aegis , 2001 , she captures the goddess in an uncharacteristically reticent pose . " I try to make each piece express what that statue seems to express . Athena is the goddess of war and peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and strength . But sometimes I depict the goddesses quite differently than expected . To me , Fragment of Athena with Golden Aegis seems vulnerable . I try to make the portraits as human as possible . " Creating these works is labor-intensive : Nike of Samothroce with Golden Wing took over six months to complete . Pappas first sketches the image to scale on paper . " When I get the image to the size I want , I draw it on the linen but the drawing is tentative . Mostly I draw with the thread - it 's the world 's slowest way of making a drawing . You could say that the statue is there in the fabric and I 'm just revealing it , slowly , tediously , " Pappas explains . She creates the dense , tapestry  --  like quality with a few essentials- linen , cotton embroidery thread , genuine gold thread and a simple running stitch . " Stitching is extremely traditional and low-tech . Basically you have a needle and thread . You could do similar things with a machine , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , quiet , meditative process . " In the Muses series , Pappas also explores the ways these images transcend time and place : how the ancient statues that inspire her have survived over so many centuries ; how the ideal of physical beauty that the goddesses represent or challenge is a fitting commentary in our image-conscious modern world ; and how the drama , violence and fortitude conveyed by these images from another age continue to resonate today . " In creating the pieces , the concept of time is important , and the time it takes to create them is important , " Pappas says . " I love the idea that you can do something by spending months on it that you could n't do in an hour or a day or a week . It 's a process of development . " Though her inspiration comes from books , photographs and sketches of statues she 's made in travels to Europe and throughout the Mediterranean , her Muses are interpretations of the originals , not copies . " I could n't make them just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go along . Drawing them freehand and hand-stitching enlivens the whole process and image . " Pappas admits that she rips out a lot of stitches when a piece does n't seem right . " I do n't care if the finished pieces are not like the statues , but they have to be plausible in my eyes . " The Muses series , started in the early 1990s , is the most recent expression in Pappas 's long and distinguished artistic career . A native of Brockton , Massachusetts , she received a B.S. in education from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1952 , and a master 's in education from Pennsylvania State University in 1960 . After teaching art at the elementary school and college level in Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Iowa and Florida , Pappas was on the faculty at the Massachusetts College of Art for more than 20 years , first as a professor , then as chair of the three-dimensional art department . She retired in 1994 as professor emerita . " I was fortunate that I always had teaching jobs and could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that when I was teaching , the students always came in with fresh ideas , so there was always something wonderful coming from them .

" I 've always been really interested in what clothes the body , " she says , " so even though I did n't do much with fabric when I was an undergraduate , it was something I was interested in . " In 1960 , she started creating fabric collages and assemblages , often incorporating clothing parts , and continued with that work for over 15 years . One of these early works , Opera Coat , 1962 , was exhibited in the seminal " Objects USA : The Johnson Collection of Contemporary Crafts " ( 1969 ) and is now in the collection of the American Craft Museum . Pappas was greatly influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which included ecclesiastical vestments , and another on the work of Mariska Karasz ( 1961 ) , who used stitchery as an art form , both at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts , and also by the combine paintings of Robert Rauschenberg . The Muses series clearly shows that Abstract Expressionism , which was in its heyday when Pappas went to art school , continues to inspire her . " I love abstraction , " she says . " I feel that with these pieces I 'm working on abstractions because I 'm stitching on a small part of it and working with a pattern , so it 's abstract and yet somehow it all comes together and becomes this illusionistic , naturalistic work . I really enjoy that dichotomy . " After completing a large commission in 1976 , Pappas tired of sewing and started doing collage with handmade paper . Because she had to balance her art with teaching and family life , this more direct medium allowed her to work fairly quickly . It was n't until Pappas saw Opera Coat again after 20 years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the past , however , she chose to use the ruins and statues imagery that she had explored in her paper collages . " The first pieces I made were based on Greek statues , with the images painted on dresslike canvas forms , " says Pappas . " But then I decided I was n't really a painter and that I had to learn to paint better or go back to sewing . " Starting the Muses series coincided with Pappas 's retirement from teaching . She relishes being a full-time artist . " It 's like a gift I 've earned . I could not have done this type of work on this scale while I was teaching . " Pappas usually works on one large stitched drawing and a small one at the same time , and she continues to make colages . She 's tried to connect the most recent collages with the fabric works . This spring , both types of work were shown at the Snyderman Gallery in Philadelphia ( May 4-26 ) . Pappas consciously uses women 's traditional tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , she says , she " joins countless women who have patiently and laboriously constructed the fabric of their lives . " These works are a bridge between the ancient and the modern , the mythic and the real , and Pappas is gratified when women respond to these dichotomies and the universality of the images she stitches . " Women are often required to fill multiple roles simultaneously and they do it with varying degrees of success . But I think they 're heroines .
