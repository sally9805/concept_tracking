<p> It 's only been out for one day , but early viewers of ' Star Wars : Episode II , ' much like the critics , are split down the middle about the latest installment of George Lucas ' venerable franchise . ( The Sun-Times ' Roger Ebert was unimpressed ; Richard Roeper loved it . ) We asked readers to e-mail us with their thoughts on ' Attack of the Clones , ' and the following is a sample of what we received . ( Spoiler alert ! Many of the following responses contain key plot points . ) <p> Four good words : Yoda with a lightsaber . Four bad words : George Lucas love scene . Overall , I was disappointed . Sure , it did n't stink nearly as bad as " Episode I , " but it was n't nearly as hip as it could have been . If they had edited out everything between the opening crawl and the last 45 minutes , they might have had something . But it was painful to watch Anakin and Padme glower at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should have been voiced by Mel Blanc , not like it cost millions to make . <p> " Episode III " might still kick some bantha behind , but only if somebody else writes and directs it . George never had much luck with those two things . Will I see it in the theater again ? Probably . Why ? Good question . May the Force be with us in three years . <p> Jason Crane <p> I liked the " Star Wars " movies better when Yoda was a puppet . Now with all the computer graphics , Yoda looks like a guy I went to high school with , and that really disturbs me . <p> Thelonious Murray <p> Roger Ebert should give up his day job ! The new " Star Wars " movie is everything it should and could be  --  shame on Roger ! <p> Janet Daly <p> Overall , I rank this film close to the top of the " Star Wars " saga . It has so many elements to satisfy the hard-core " Star Wars " fan . The satisfaction I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had toward " Star Wars " after the revelations of " The Empire Strikes Back . " I understand " Phantom Menace " much better now and I am once more excited and depressed that another three years will have to pass before I can feel this way again . <p> Though I agree with Mr. Ebert 95 percent of the time , I think that this time around , Mr. Roeper has his fingers on the pulse of the " Star Wars " populace . <p> Pat Harrington <p> The last half-hour is great : intense battle scenes and rewarding payoffs with older characters . But most of the movie is slow going , the special effects become too much after awhile , and the dialogue is horrible . I do n't expect Oscar-worthy acting , but I wish Lucas had some idea how to direct humans . <p> Unfortunately , he seems to have poured all of his effort into creating new , amazing sights ... which , of course , were splendid to look at . Until I got sick of ' em and wanted something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mark describing the love story as a series of romantic cliches . But despite one unbearable fireplace scene with Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen , the movie was exciting and very nostalgic . I am in no way affiliated with the " cult " of " Star Wars , " but I did enjoy the older ones . If you fall into this category , you will probably like " Attack of the Clones " as much as I did . <p> Sasha Sievers <p> I agree completely with Ebert 's review . Not only is there no quotable dialogue , there are no memorable scenes . The digital effects revolution that Lucas has created may be able to show alien landscapes and characters , but a computer can never come up with competent acting , believable dialogue or genuine emotion . <p> " AOTC " is false storytelling at is worst . <p> Josh McAdams <p> Yes , it drags its feet when it comes to political intrigue and the Anakin/Padme romance . Yes , the dialogue is as mechanical and unwieldy as a Trade Federation droid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . <p> But by the time Master Yoda steps up to Count Dooku and represents for the Jedi , you 'll wonder why you were squirming in your seat an hour ago . <p> You came for the Clone War fireworks , and " Attack " delivers them in fine style . ' Nuff said . <p> J. Osicki <p> I was one of the lucky few who was able to see the film projected digitally . Once the film started I was hooked  --  the film is the best " Star Wars " film since " Empire . " I really enjoyed the dark tone " Clones " had over the sugar-coated , sappy- sweet " Menace . " <p> Edwin Samuelson <p> Roger Ebert wrote , " The dialogue in ' Episode II ' exists primarily to advance the plot , provide necessary information and give a little screen time to continuing characters who are back for a new episode . " I felt that the dialogue was memorable , Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman were believable in their love story , and the visual images were believable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do see flaws with the love story and other things . But all films have flaws , and this one has enough good qualities to override the bad ones . <p> In a side note , because Ebert was one of the few critics who loved " Phantom Menace " for its visual effects and action sequences , I find it difficult to believe he gave it a poor rating . <p> Christine Chriscaden <p> How could George Lucas cast Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker ? Where did this kid take acting lessons ? It 's a shame that such great actors as Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman had to share the screen with him . He singlehandedly ruined the movie for me . Richard Roeper actually thought there was chemistry between Portman and Christensen ? Are you kidding ? She never looked comfortable with him . They may be two of the hottest young faces in Hollywood , but Natalie Portman definitely deserves to work with better talent . <p> Yoda rules ! <p> Matt Towson <p> " Clones " is a technological spectacle , yet it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its central problem is its total dependence on CGI . The CGI is cold and lacks palpability . I find it much easier to believe in a Muppet Yoda than this CGI Yoda . <p> I find myself yearning for a return to 20 years ago when special effects were more dependent on costume and construction . The alien characters were more believable , even if we did know they were humans just dressed up . <p> Alvin Kimel <p> Pretty flat . Nothing jumped out at us . It 's sad that the " Star Wars " movies are no longer experiences that can sweep us away , but merely exercises in which we make mental checklists of what Lucas has done right and what he has done wrong . <p> As for the character of Anakin , it defies belief that over a thousand actors were tested for this part , and it ended up being performed by Hayden Christensen , who comes across as nothing but a sulky teenager . <p> Ian Waldron-Mantgani <p> I saw " Clones " last night at midnight . It was amazing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about certain aspects of the romance , and the story does drag at times . But what I do n't understand is how he could give " Episode I " thumbs up and give this one thumbs down ! " Clones " is not only better , but it probably has better action sequences than any of the " Star Wars " films . <p> If you 're an action fan , " Spider-Man " has nothing on " Clones . " And if you are a " Star Wars " fan , you will be grateful that Lucas has brought back the thrills , and chills of the original trilogy . <p> Christopher Knight
