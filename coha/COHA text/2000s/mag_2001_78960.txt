She flew above it all . The rains came and shredded the schedule ; her father made the usual spectacle of himself by babbling about how she might retire ; her sister ran out of the tournament grabbing at her ailing gut . None of it came close to touching her . Venus Williams spent the Wimbledon fortnight like a queen in a tower in the sky , so remote it was eerie . She did n't want worship . She did n't want coaching . " I wanted silence , " she said on Sunday . " I wanted to do my own thinking , and I did n't want anyone to bother me . I knew what I was going to do . I was n't going to play silly . I was going to execute . " // She executed , all right . Gliding through the draw with regal ease , taking out opponents with off-with-their-heads imperiousness , she won her second straight Wimbledon crown  --  and third Grand Slam event in 12 months  --  by hammering 19-year-old upstart Justine Henin 6-1 , 3-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gorgeous backhand with flat , skidding 115-mph serves and heavy groundstrokes , Williams took only a few halfhearted hops in celebration . The crowd cheered politely . She did n't care . " For sure , they wanted her to win , " Williams said of Henin , " but it 's not an issue . I do n't need approval . " // Wimbledon has a long tradition of champions more respected than loved , but Bjorn Borg , Martina Navratilova , Steffi Graf and the man Williams replaces as the most feared player on grass , 29-year-old Pete Sampras , all eventually revealed that they had yearned for the fans ' affection . However , at 21 Williams betrays no insecurity , no grand ambition , no drive to break any career record  --  nothing , that is , but her astonishing speed and the ability to suddenly raise her game , with no grass-court preparation , to genius level . Stung by her loss six weeks ago in the first round of the French Open , Williams went home to South Florida and practiced her way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles and an Olympic gold medal last year . // Just as astonishing was Williams 's ability to concentrate amid the growing chaos around her . Wimbledon 2001 was a palace coup . The king , Sampras , was deposed ; Andre the Giant took to cursing and firing balls at linespeople ; and a plague known as Henmania infected the populace . Most jarring , a court jester named Goran Ivanisevic , who introduced himself variously as Good Goran , 911 Goran and Crazy Goran , took over . He popped painkillers , ripped off his shirt after winning , watched Teletubbies each morning  --  and then outlasted Australia 's Patrick Rafter 6-3 , 3-6 , 6-3 , 2-6 , 9-7 in Monday 's excruciatingly wondrous men 's final to become the first wild card to win a Grand Slam tournament . // " If somebody told me that two months ago , I would say , ' Man , you 're crazy , ' " said Ivanisevic , the 125th-ranked player , who pulled off one of the greatest series of upsets in tennis history . The 29-year-old Croatian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had lost in the first round of qualifying at this year 's Australian Open and had won only nine matches all year . He got his wild card at Wimbledon because he had thrice reached the final there and lost . " I do n't want to get another plate ; I already have three plates , " Ivanisevic said before this year 's final , referring to the silver plate that goes to the runner-up . " If some angel comes tonight in my dreams and say , ' O.K. , Goran , you going to win Wimbledon tomorrow , but you not able to touch the racket ever again in your life , ' I say , ' O.K. , I take that . ' " // Who could blame him ? Blessed with an effortless bomb of a serve , Ivanisevic seemed destined to finish his career as one of sport 's lovable losers , a man who could make tennis look both so easy and so hard . Of his three defeats in the Wimbledon final  --  one to Andre Agassi and two to Sampras  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not psychologist , you know . I am mature , but sometimes I am not . " // The Ivanisevic who showed up at Wimbledon this year , though , was a toned-down version . During the final he kept himself under control most of the time . Once , when he was serving in the fourth set and a double fault was called , he erupted , swearing , throwing his racket and kicking the net . He argued with chair umpire Jorge Diaz and after the match called one linesperson ugly and said another one looked like a faggot . " But then I say , ' O.K. , you said enough , you got everything out , ' " Ivanisevic said afterward . " ' This is final , keep cool . ' Maybe five years ago , I lose four or five games , and then I 'm finished . " // Not this year . Lashing his psyche to the deck in the fifth set , Ivanisevic pressured Rafter by holding serve easily until , in the 15th game , Rafter cracked . He served up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehand past him for the crucial break . " Everyone thought , He had n't done anything in Grand Slams for the last few years , " the 28-year-old Rafter said following the final . " Why would anybody give him any hope of coming back and doing what he 's done ? " // Television programmers on both sides of the pond were n't pleased that Sunday 's men 's final was moved to Monday , and the thick-witted response by the All England Club to this year 's wet final weekend again raised cries in favor of placing a dome over Centre Court . Nothing should put more pressure on the brains at SW 19 than Tim Henman 's loss to Ivanisevic in the semifinals . On Friday , with Henman playing masterfully and up two sets to one and 2-1 in the fourth set , rain caused the suspension of play at 6:18 p.m . " I could n't hurt him in any way , " Ivanisevic said on Sunday . // Shortly after 8 p.m. , the All England Club postponed the rest of the match until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough light to play about 30 more minutes . Then , instead of heeding forecasters who said there would be dry weather early on Saturday , Wimbledon scheduled the match to resume at 1 p.m . That start was washed out , and play did n't resume until 5:37 . By then Ivanisevic had screwed his head back on . He won the fourth set in a tiebreaker and led the fifth set 3-2 when more rain pushed play to Sunday . When three All England Club officials were asked at a Saturday night press conference why they had n't started that morning , none responded for 10 seconds . Referee Alan Mills grew red in the face and blurted , " Good question . " // Bad answer , and one more reason for critics to declare that Wimbledon 's relevance is diminishing . The grass-court season has essentially shrunk to four weeks , the number of grass-court players has dwindled to a handful , and the player seeded No. 1 , Sampras , has not won a tournament since taking his seventh Wimbledon crown last year . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last eight years at Wimbledon lost in five sets to 19-year-old Roger Federer in the fourth round . ) Both the French and U.S. Opens are regarded as truer tests for the modern game , and it has become less a sin to bypass the low bounces and dodgy food of England . Desperate to head off a boycott by claycourters , Wimbledon expanded its seedings this year from 16 to the top 32 players , but that did n't stop Gustavo Kuerten , a 1999 Wimbledon quarterfinalist , from becoming the first No. 1 player in 28 years to skip Wimbledon because he wanted a rest . // Williams , who has been picking and choosing the tournaments she plays , says she 's finally ready to take a different approach . After nearly two years of part-time play , the world 's No. 2 player declared on Sunday that she would beef up her schedule and gun for the No. 1 ranking held by Martina Hingis . Australian and French Open champion Jennifer Capriati ended her Grand Slam run when she hit the wall during her semifinal against Henin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a loss in a tennis match had no power to hurt her . She is certain she 's in her prime and ready to battle on . If some people want to take her newfound perspective as a sign of weakness , she 's happy to prove them wrong . " I 've always had a strong character , a strong personality , and I 'm not going to let someone ruin my life or control my life , " Capriati said last week . " I 'm not a victim . I 'm going to make everybody else a victim . " // In the end the 2001 Championships shrugged off their limitations and their oft-insipid management to provide the most stirring men 's tournament in years . Federer , Taylor Dent and Lleyton Hewitt , both 20 , and Andy Roddick , 18 , broke out with moments of superb tennis and great theater  --  the best showing yet by tennis 's New Balls generation . Meanwhile , with the hot breath of time on their necks , Rafter , Ivanisevic , Agassi , 31 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to erupt " as they advanced to the semis . Each knew this might be his best shot at his first or last Wimbledon title , and the pressure stripped all four men to the core . // The men 's tour has been obsessed with matching the women 's parade of overhyped personalities , but this was something better : character revealed , in full view of millions . Ivanisevic , long tagged a choker , proved capable of humility and calm under fire . Henman , in his third trip to the Wimbledon semifinals , showed that he 's willing to withstand anything to grab the only championship that matters to him , never mind that his game may be too weak to win it . Agassi has been charming and cool during his late-career run over the past two years , but last week he reverted to his snarly , profane earlier self . He fired a 122-mph serve at a linesman who 'd made two questionable calls during Agassi 's classic five-set semifinal against Rafter . Then , after being turned in by a lineswoman for muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later snapped , " I blame her husband " for her apparent prudishness . Rafter , who is taking six months off at the end of this year , stayed the same self-effacing , sporting mate he has always been portrayed as , proving that sometimes what you see is what you get . When he and Ivanisevic hugged at the net after the final , Rafter affectionately ruffled his opponent 's hair . // But that was after the storm had ended . For the first time the men 's final was contested not before the usual All England Club members but before a riot of Aussie and Croat supporters who 'd camped out the night before for 10,000 unreserved Centre Court tickets and then turned the usually subdued proceedings into a virtual soccer match . Once Rafter was broken at 7-7 in the fifth set , everybody knew that the battle would be fought in Goran 's head . // Ivanisevic sprayed a volley , followed with a service winner , double-faulted , threw in two aces and found himself at championship point . He held his hands together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve four feet behind the service line . He bailed himself out with another big serve , then double-faulted again on his second match point . On his third match point he squatted in the grass , hoping that even more begging would get God on his side . After a volley by Ivanisevic , Rafter lobbed the ball cleanly over his head . Ivanisevic was a mess . Then something funny happened . He faced his fourth match point and did the unthinkable : nothing . He did n't crane his eyes to the heavens , did n't cross himself , did n't ask the crowd for help . Inside , though , Ivanisevic made one more plea . God , please . You are testing me enough . Not four match points . " He wanted to be sure that I 'm really a man , " Ivanisevic said . // His first serve went wide . On the second , instead of launching his typical missile , Ivanisevic lofted the ball down the middle at 109 mph . Rafter 's forehand landed in the net . The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard . " This is it , " he said . " This is the end of the world . " // And the end of Goran as we know him . " Today my life changes , " he said . " Finally I am the champion . Now people are going to look at me differently . I going to look at myself differently . Now I am proud of myself . " // Ivanisevic then revealed plans to " get drunk , fly for another week and put myself back to earth . " As he spoke , he had his hat on backward and looked as goofy as ever , but what he said was true . Everyone was looking at him differently now . The jester had become the king .
