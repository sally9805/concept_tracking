His Wicked Kiss By Gaelen Foley Random House Gaelen Foley February , 1818 She wanted to dance . Her toes in silken slippers tapped beneath the hem of her white -- no , blue -- no , her green silk gown , in time with the elegant strains from the orchestra . Innumerable twinkling candles on the crystal chandeliers cast a golden haze over the ballroom , where pairs of gliding dancers whirled through the steps of the new , daring waltz : ladies in rich , pale , luminous silks , gentlemen in stately black and white . Suddenly , through the crowd , she sensed someone staring at her . Peeking over her painted fan , she caught only a glimpse of a tall , imposing figure before the swirling motion of the dancers hid him from her view again . Her pulse leaped . A thrill rushed through her , for she could sense him , feel him coming to ask her to stand up with him for the next quadrille . Wide-eyed , her heart pounding , she waited , yearning for a clearer look at the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a prickle of instinctual warning on her nape summoned Eden Farraday back from her lovely reverie . Her rapt gaze focused slowly as reality pressed back in on her reluctant senses , bringing with it all the ceaseless sounds and pungent smells of another black , humid night in the tropical forest . Instead of crystal chandeliers , a lone , rusty lanterngleamed on the bamboo table beside her hammock , which was draped beneath a cloud of filmy white mosquito netting . In place of lords and ladies , pale moths danced and flittered against the lantern 's glass , and beyond the palm-thatched roof of the naturalists ' jungle stilt-house , the darkness throbbed with teeming life . Insects sang in deafening cadence . Monkeys bickered for the most comfortable branches to sleep on in the trees , but at least the raucous parrots had quit their noisy squabbling . Far off in the distance , a jaguar roared to warn a rival off its territory , for the great stealthy beasts ' hunting hour had come . Its fierce echo chased away her shining vision of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it -- a yellowed , crinkled , year-old copy of a fashion magazine , La Belle Assemblee , sent by her dear cousin Amelia all the way from England . The sense of danger , however , still remained . She glanced around uneasily , her jungle-honed instincts on alert ; her hand crept toward the pistol that was always by her side . And then she heard it . A faint and subtle hiss from much too close overhead . Lifting her gaze , she found herself eye to cold , beady eye with a monstrous eight-foot fer-de-lance . Fangs gleaming , the deadly serpent flicked its forked tongue in her direction . She shrank back slowly , not daring to move too fast . Seeking warm-blooded prey , the big snake seemed to sense the vibrations of her pounding heart . The species invaded many a human dwelling in the torrid zone : humans left crumbs ; crumbs brought mice ; and the mice brought the fer-de-lance , a notoriously ill-tempered viper with a reputation for attacking with the slightest provocation . Its bite spelled doom . Slim and sinuous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter . It must have gone silently exploring then in search of a plump rodent entree , for at present it was coiled around the post from which her hammock hung , and was studying her like it wondered how she 'd taste . To her amazement , it had sliced through the mosquito netting with those daggered fangs that dispensed a venom capable of killing a large man in under half an hour . Eden had seen it happen , and it was not a pleasant death . When the fer-de-lance arched its scaly neck into that ominous S shape , she had a fleeting fraction of a second to see the attack coming , then it struck -- angry reptile snapping out like a whip , a flash of fangs . She flung herself onto her back on her hammock , brought up her pistol , and fired . A disgusted yelp escaped her as the snake 's severed head plopped right onto the center of her treasured magazine . " Bloody --  ! " she started , then stopped herself from uttering the rest , only mouthing the epithet , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That dashed magazine had taken a blasted year to reach her , coming via courier by way of Jamaica . Rolling nimbly out of her hammock , Eden scowled at the wide-mouthed snake head that now marred the elegant publication . She flipped her long plait of auburn hair over her shoulder , brushed the mosquito netting aside and stepped away , shaking off her latest brush with death . " Everything all right , dear ? " her father , Dr. Victor Farraday , called in a casual tone from his work tent across the naturalists ' camp , located deep in the heart of Venezuela 's green , steaming Orinoco Delta . She shot a distracted glance in his direction . " Fine , Father ! " she yelled back and , with shaking hands , put her gun away . Lord , I ca n't wait to get out of here . With a grimace , she picked up the magazine like a tray , balancing the dead snake 's head on it , and marched stoically to the rustic railing that overlooked the wide , onyx river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heard it plop down into the Orinoco with a small splash . Well , no doubt something would eat it in minutes , she thought . That was the law of the jungle : Eat or be eaten . Sending a wary glance out across the inky river , she saw a number of red eyes gleaming by the lantern 's glow , and then a large thing submerged with barely a ripple in the silver moonlight . Eden shook her head . Man-eating crocodiles , poisonous snakes , bloodsucking bats -- and Papa said London was dangerous . Patience , she told herself , doing her best to keep her hunger for civilization in check . It would n't be much longer now . They would soon be going home to England whether Papa liked it or not . Turning to gaze in the direction of her father 's work tent , her face filled with determination . She gave herself a small nod . Yes . The suspense was torture . She had to hear Papa 's decision -- now . She tore off the pages of her magazine that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooking fires , then strode out of their native-style dwelling , known as a palafito . She fixed her sights on the naturalists ' main work tent across the camp . A ring of torches burned around the perimeter of the clearing to keep the beasts at bay , but there was little help for the mosquitoes . She swatted one away as she passed the fire pit in the center of camp , where she greeted their three black servants with affection . Their bright grins flashed in the darkness . Now that the heat of day had passed , the servants , dressed in flowing , light , tropical garb , were cooking dinner for themselves . Eden exchanged a few teasing remarks with them and forged on . The skirts of her cotton walking dress swirled around her legs and her thick leather boots sunk firmly into the soft turf with every stride . Her forward stare was confident , but in truth , her heart was pounding as she waited for the verdict . Ahead , beneath the three-sided military-style tent , Dr. Victor Farraday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads together in close discussion , poring over a weathered map . The field table was strewn with the latest specimens they had collected today on their trek , led by the local Waroa shaman to where the medicine plants grew . For now , however , their new finds were forgotten . Their faces were tense and serious by the dim orange glow of the lantern . It was no wonder why . Her treasured magazine was not the only item the courier had brought today from the outer world , smuggling their mail and a few supplies in past the Spanish fleet trolling the coast . There had also been a letter , equally out of date , from the solicitor representing Papa 's aristocratic patron back in England . The letter announced the sad tidings that the old , philanthropic fourth Earl of Pembrooke , alas , had gone on to his eternal reward some months ago . His Lordship 's heir , the fifth earl , was young and dashing , rumored to be quite handsome and , if the Society pages of La Belle Assemblee could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bit of a rakehell . The new Lord Pembrooke was building himself a fine new country house , and as far as he was concerned , all the artists and scholars , musicians and sculptors and scientists that his grandfather had for so long commissioned could go hang . So he had instructed his solicitor to say . In short , the famed Dr. Farraday had lost the funding for his research , and Eden had nearly cheered aloud to hear it . She had bitten her tongue , however , and suppressed her joy , for Papa had turned pale at the news , committed as any obsessed genius to his work . Oh , but it was n't as though they would starve once they reached England , she reasoned with a hardheaded practicality that usually balanced out her dreamy side . A trained physician and now a prestigious author as well , Dr. Farraday had a standing offer of a highly respectable teaching post at the Royal College of Medicine in London . When he accepted it , as he surely must , it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hyde Park among the other elegantes , causing the young bucks to wreck their stylish phaetons for turning to stare at them . Soon -- who could say ? she might actually have a normal life . Clasping her hands behind her back , Eden cleared her throat politely to get the gentlemen 's attention . The two scientists had been so absorbed in their discussion they had not noticed her standing there . At once , they fell silent , halting their low-toned discussion . " Well , boys , " she said with a jaunty smile , trying with a touch of humor to lighten some of the tension they all were feeling about the sudden change in their situation . " When are we finally going to leave ? " Alas , her jest fell flat . The pair exchanged a guarded glance . Belatedly , Connor stood in the presence of a lady , knowing how she loved these small gestures of civility . Connor O'Keefe was a tanned , blond , towering Australian , over six feet tall and twice as broad as the tribal warriors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and a specialist in zoology ; his sensitivity to the forest animals was endearing to Eden , but more and more frequently of late , his unbroken stares made her uneasy . " Everything all right ? " he asked , resting his hands on his waist with a concerned frown . " Why did you fire ? " " A fer-de-lance got into the house . Sorry , Con . It was either your snaky friend or me . " " Good God , are you all right ? " her father exclaimed , whipping off his spectacles and starting forward in his chair . " I 'm fine , Father , " she assured him . " I wondered if Connor would take the vile thing away . Most of it 's still stuck in the rafters , " she said with a wince . The Australian nodded firmly , then glanced at her father . " I 'll be right back , sir . " " Yes , er , give us a moment , my boy . I should like to have a word with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give Eden 's shoulder a gentle squeeze . " You 're sure you 're all right ? " he murmured .
