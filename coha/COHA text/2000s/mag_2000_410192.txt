The Ultimate Payoff. bikini by Pisces Swimwear , jacket by DKNY Active . // GOT YOUR DATE BOOK HANDY ? Turn to the month of June and mark the date eight weeks from tomorrow . You might write , " Put on that new bikini and celebrate with a walk on the beach ! " or maybe , " I DID IT ! " Why the celebration ? Because by that time you will have finished our newest , smartest summer bodyshaping routine . Not only will the workout help you lose fat ( if you need to ) and tone up , it 's also geared to get you outside and into your hiking boots , cycling shorts or bathing suit . This program focuses on the three essentials of fitness : cardiovascular training , resistance exercise and flexibility . You know the drill : Cardio exercise strengthens your heart and burns calories ; resistance work increases muscle , boosts metabolism and changes your shape ; while stretching reduces your risk of injury and helps keep your muscles supple and joints stable . But now there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than the sum of its parts . Do all three types of exercises and the results will come faster than ever before . We 'll explain the cardio portion of this workout on page 122 ( " Fast and Easy Fat Burning " ) , but first we 're going to take you through a stretch-and-strengthen program designed by exercise physiologist Wayne Westcott , PhD. , director of fitness research at the South Shore YMCA in Quincy , Mass . Westcott 's research has shown that stretching can boost strength . In two 10-week studies of 76 untrained men and women , the subjects who included stretching in their weight-training routines gained an average of 19 percent more strength than the subjects who simply lifted weights . " Stretching seems to make muscles more responsive to strength-building stimulus , " says Westcott . Although you could stretch after your workout for the same results , the routine that Westcott designed for Shape alternates the stretching and strength training within the workout This way , you wo n't be tempted to blow off your stretch routine at the end . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for a more-active summer ! Whether you are a beginning exerciser or an expert , do the following eight exercises in the order shown . Take 6 counts to perform each strength-training rep : 2 slow counts to lift the weight and 4 counts to lower it , using enough weight to fatigue your muscles in 12 reps . You 'll only do one set of strength exercises and then you 'll stretch . Using the machine as a prop , hold each stretch to a point of mild tension for 20 seconds without bouncing . After stretching , move quickly to the next machine . By the time you 've adjusted the machine and selected the weight , your body will have rested enough . To progress over the 8 weeks , beginning and intermediate exercisers should increase the weight load by about 5 percent at every third workout . Frequency Do This workout 2 or 3 times per week . Research suggests that performing this routine 3 times a week yields results about 10 percent better than a twice-a- week routine . warm-up and cool- down Begin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise on the machine of your choice . If you want to do the main cardio portion of your exercise plan before your weight training , that 's fine , too . Abdominal exercises Include ab exercises , either on an ab machine or onthe floor , at the end of every workout. do 1 set of 12 reps if you 're on a plate- or stack-loaded ab machine . Do 20-25 reps if you 're performing crunches on the floor . Afterward , stretch your abs by lying on hte floor on your back with arms and legs extended and reach out as far as you can .
