Wormwood From the top-floor window of his large four-storey house on Bloomsbury Square Dr. Sabian Blake could see the farthest depths of space . He stared out into the night sky through the thick lens of his long brass telescope . He had watched the skies for the past week , and he was waiting -- waiting for the sign that he knew would come that night . The strange glow to the north had grown stronger and brighter , causing the stars to fade and never allowing the night to be truly dark . The full moon had burned blood red , lighting the streets with a warm crimson glow almost as bright as the sun . Blake was an astronomer , doctor , scientist and a master of the Cabala . Every hour of every day was spent working out the times of the rising of the sun , the waning of the stars , and the phases of the moon as it crossed the sky . Blake turned the minute-glass as the sand timer spilled its soft white particles from one orb to the other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the final grains of sand had trickled from the top chamber before carefully turning the large hour-glass . The dark wood of the hour-glass was decorated with serpent columns whose jewel eyes , gold teeth and carved scales shimmered in the moonlight . Blake checked each sand hour against the old brass clock that ticked and tocked laboriously next to the astrolabe on the ornate stone mantel of the empty fireplace . Blake did Cabalistic calculations all night , every night . From his computations he knew that somewhere in the Twelfth House of the universe a sign would be given . The Nemorensis said so . The Nemorensis never lied ; it was the only book to be trusted . It was said to touch the Nemorensis was to hold the secrets of the cosmos in your hands . No one knew where the book had come from , but many had died trying to find its secrets . Now the Book of Nemorensis belonged to Blake . It was his by right , divine right as he often thought to himself . As he looked into deep space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Quirtle when , shortly after dawn , he had opened the parcel that a coachman had delivered to his door . From the outset Blake had been suspicious of the coachman , because he had never seen someone who claimed such a low estate to be dressed so well . There was no hint of shabbiness in his neat black coat and clean boots . His pure white skin held no trace of hard labour , no trace of the London grime from horse muck and carriage grease . What had intrigued Blake about the man was the gold ring he wore on the middle finger of his right hand . It had a large red stone set in a gold mount cut into the shape of the sun . From one side a flaming trail formed the thick gold band that encircled his finger . Messenger the man was , coachman he was not ! But Blake 's eyes had immediately been enticed by the shape and contours of the gift he was being offered . This was an epiphany , a gift to a wise man -- a wise man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soles of his feet and turning his stomach . It was an exquisite feeling , exciting and dangerous . Deep inside , Blake knew that the gift he was about to open would have life-changing possibilities . The package had been tightly wrapped in a gold silk cloth and tied with red cotton braid , a colour so bright and vivid that it shimmered and looked fluid . There was nothing to say who had sent such a fine gift and the coachman had , when questioned , been vague as to how it had come into his possession and who had told him to deliver it . " A man just stopped me in the street , " he had said softly , avoiding contact with Blake 's strong gaze and keeping the brim of his hat low over his eyes . " He waved his arms about like a madman , nearly frightened the horses to death . Foreign man , could hardly speak a word of the King 's tongue . Never seen one that looked like him before . All he kept saying was Number 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Blake , pressed a guinea coin in my hand , and then turned and ran . " Blake questioned him further . " You know my name . Did the man tell you ? " " Everyone knows you , Doctor Blake . You are a man of letters , " the coachman smiled . " In fact , I can now say that you are a man of parcels ! " At that he laughed , handed over the heavy gift , and walked promptly to the carriage . Blake watched as he picked his way through the filth and puddles , jumped on to the driving seat and slowly drove the horse and carriage up the muddy road of Bloomsbury Square . Without hesitation , Blake tore at the parcel , unable to wait until he got inside . He sat on the white marble steps and quickly pulled open the silk wrapping . It was then that he first looked upon the Nemorensis : a book so splendid in appearance that it caused his heart to beat faster . The thick leather cover was encrusted in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had faded with the years , scratched in small letters . He had never thought he would ever hold the Nemorensis , even if he believed it had existed . Now he knew -- now it was his ! Late one night , several weeks afterwards , Blake was leafing through the parchment pages , trying to glean every piece of knowledge ; and there in the sixth chapter of the sixth book , on the final page , written by an unknown hand in the margin , he read the words : Wormwood . . . the bright star shall fall from the sky . . . and many will die from its bitterness . From that day he had searched every corner of the heavens looking for the new star , convinced that this would be the sign that a new age was about to begin , a golden dawn to enlighten small , feeble human minds . Generations had spoken of its coming and had faded away before seeing the enlightenment . The illumination of the world was drawing near and he would be the first to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of hot tea and smiled to himself . He looked again through the lens of the telescope that rested on its fine oak tripod . The stars and planets remained the same , the universe was unaltered , in a few hours the night would be over and nothing would have changed . He stamped angrily on the wooden floorboards . " Blast , bother and gibbor . Will it ever come ? " he asked himself impatiently , his words echoing around the empty room . He began to doubt his calculations and wondered whether by some chance he had predicted the wrong day , week , or even year . He looked again and more anxiously into the night , hoping against hope that somewhere in a far-off galaxy a new light had appeared . It was midnight ; far in the distance he heard the sound of St George 's church clock chiming out the hour . Suddenly the house began to vibrate and shudder . The whole world lurched forwards , then backwards , and then spun even faster . Blake heard a looking-glass drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascaded from the roof to drop the four storeys , smashing like leaves of baked clay in the road below . Plaster fell from the ceiling . At any moment he thought the house would fall to the ground . In an instant the stars vanished . Time and time again , the sun rose , then set ; night became morning , then night again . Eleven suns came , followed by eleven moons , rising and setting from east to west . There was no way to understand what was happening . Blake held fast to the telescope and tripod , hoping that each jolt would be the last , hoping that each dawn would not blast into daylight then into night -- hoping that whatever was now striking the world would stop . Then there was blackness -- a still , sharp blackness surrounded by complete silence . There was no more day and no more night . There was utter emptiness , as if the world was over and the universe had imploded , sucked into some vast dark hole in space . Blake stared through the eyepiece but saw nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamour and panic in the street . He could hear the screams from below as men and women grappled in the darkness , hanging on to the iron railings of the newly-built gardens . Blake could not see the window . He turned away from the telescope and edged the three feet across the room to where he knew the open window would be . The blackness was so deep , so intense , that it almost smothered and choked him . His feet tangled in the long belt cord of the thick , red dressing gown that he wore over his clothes to keep out the cold . It was cheaper than a fire or a warming pan , but now in the darkness he regretted his meagerliness and longed for even the faintest glimmer of firelight . He fumbled his way to the window . In the street he could hear the cry of frightened horses stomping in the mud , their hooves nervously cracking against the stones . Far below him by the inn 's gaslight he could see the terrified revellers spill out into the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the streets . Pistol shots rang out as the militia fired recklessly into the darkness . The whole world seemed to be on the verge of madness . Without any warning , a blinding flash filled the sky . Far to the east a shaft of pure white light penetrated the atmosphere . No one could escape its brightness as it cut across the heavens like a lightning bolt . London fell silent ; the whole town waited . In his room , Blake managed to find his telescope . He looked to the skies and the shaft of light came again , and again , flashing brighter and brighter , piercing the darkness . Blake saw through the telescope what he had been waiting for . High in the northeast at the crown of heaven he could see a star , but this was no ordinary star -- it was a sky dragon . Blake could clearly see a long white tail that streamed far behind the bright luminous head . A comet of such proportions the world had never seen before . " Can it be true ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " It ca n't be , I deceive myself , " he said in a strong voice , hoping to bolster himself against the rising panic that now gripped his feet and crawled up to his knees . " But the Nemorensis said it is so . The comet is coming towards the earth , " he muttered in disbelief . " The dragon is coming home ! " In the east the sun began slowly to rise . It was a quarter past midnight but the dawn had come . Blake chuckled to himself and shook his head . Outside , the panic had ceased ; the crowds that had gathered in the street looked to the sky . The stunned revellers from the tavern wrapped soiled arms around each other in relief that the earthquake and sky-storm were over . They ignored the injured and the dying , and howled at the rising sun , which burnt bright against the fading black sky . Blake could not contain himself and had the urge to shout the news of his discovery from the window to the gathering below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bare wood floorboards and swirling his thick red dressing gown backwards and forwards like a pantomime dame . He danced and he laughed and he sang out loud : " Wormwood ! Wormwood ! Wormwood ! " As he swirled he tripped and fell to the floor , wrapping himself tighter in his robe and laughing as he rolled around like some peculiar stuffed sausage . In the looking-glassed ceiling of the room he saw himself criss-crossed by shadows from the leaded pane of the window . He wanted to laugh until he was fit to burst -- tears rolled down his face as his belly ripped and roared with laughter that echoed against each wall , then faded as it escaped the open window at the front of the house . Only he could see the comet ; it was Blake 's Comet , the bringer of his new age . Then Blake became aware that a sudden and deep silence had descended . The crowd had stopped looking at the sky , people were now staring to the open ground of Holborn and the fields that surrounded Lincoln 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooves banging against earth and stone ; it was the growing fever of frightened horses . The beasts that had been left in the square quickly joined in , as if summoned by some unspoken call , kicking out at those who stood by , knocking one man from his feet with a blow to his spine that dropped him dead to the ground . Echoing from Holborn came the sound of the horses approaching , neighing and snorting as they stampeded through the streets . Some still dragged the tattered and torn remains of the once fine carriages that they had pulled . Others ran free of rein or carriage rod as they kicked and bucked , as if to rid themselves of the unseen force that snapped and bit at their fetlocks . The stampede filled the street and moved through the gathered crowd on Holborn fields like a cavalry charge , cutting down all those that stood in its way . Over a hundred horses turned into the square -- grey , black and bay , once benign equines now transformed by fear , running for their lives . Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . He shouted to the crowd but the noise of the horses drowned his words , and he banged his fists in despair against the window ledge . Within seconds the stampede engulfed all those who stood in its path . Their victims made very little noise -- no shouts of fear , no time to run . All that was left in the wake of the maelstrom was the broken flotsam of human bodies , a jetsam of cadavers washed up by a living tide . The only survivors were those who had clung to the railings , hidden in doorways or jumped into the basements of the tall row of newly built houses that overlooked the square . There they cowered in fear like so many rats packed into a barrel . The reason for the horses fear quickly became apparent . Chasing the horses into Bloomsbury Square came a surge of a thousand dogs that appeared to spill from the alleyways , runnels and every corner of London . The air was filled with barking and snarling as they bit and snapped at everything in their path , controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , palpable and beyond imagination . Children who had come into the street to see the spectacular sky now screamed as the pack scented out their victims . Everyone ran , scrambled up trees , jumped over fences or climbed the stonework of houses to get out of the reach of the hounds . Street dogs , fine spaniels of rich men , deck hounds from river barges and preened lap dogs ran together , roused by some atavistic hunger . Blake looked on as a young boy scampered the length of Bloomsbury Square . He was no more than twelve years old ; his shoeless feet carried him quickly over the mud , chased by several dogs that snapped at his heels and coat tails . He screamed as he ran . To his right and lying helpless on the floor was an old woman . She was surrounded by a pack of dogs that grabbed at her arms and legs and pulled her across the ground like a rag doll . The boy lunged for the low branch of a tree and , reaching out at full stretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large black mongrel jumped forward with bared teeth , trying to sink them into his flesh . Chaos covered the whole square as the dogs split into smaller packs to chase their victims into Gallon Place and Coptic Street . It seemed as if the whole of London was filled with the cries of people being savaged . There was a sudden and loud banging on the door of Blake 's house . The large brass tapping-handle was smashed repeatedly against the door plate , echoing through the hallway and up the circular staircase to the observation room . Blake looked out below . There in the street was Isaac Bonham , friend and Fellow of the Royal Society . He shouted loudly as he banged the door and tried to shake off a small brown deck hound that was gripping his leg . " Blake , in the name of Hermes let me in ! " he cried , the pain of the bite tingeing his voice . " Blake , shoot the thing ! Let me in , do something ! " The dog let out a loud squeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . But then three large mastiffs slowly walked into the square . They were wheezing and breathless , their mouths stained with fresh blood . They looked at Bonham , and even from such a distance they could smell his fear . Blake ran to the door , knowing he would have to move faster than the dogs if he were to save his friend . Down and down he ran , round and round , along each landing , his heart pounding in his chest . Outside , the mastiffs stared at Bonham for several moments and then set off , covering the ground towards him a yard at a time . They slavered and growled as they ran , baring their large stained teeth , getting closer by the second . Bonham screamed as he watched the dogs pounding down on him . He felt like a cornered fox about to be torn apart , ripped and eaten . " Quickly man , let me in ! " Blake stumbled over his feet , fell one length of the stairs and crumpled on the landing of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonham , look out man , I 'm here ! " he shouted . He knew that he had one more flight and then the length of the hall before he got to the front door . And then panic hit him : the key , where was the key ? Outside , Bonham watched as the mastiffs pounded the mud with their paws , racing each other , their speed increasing with the prospect of a kill . He braced himself for what was to come . He squared his back against the door and drew a small flintlock pistol from his belt , knowing he would have only one shot , knowing he could not kill all three creatures . With both hands he aimed the gun at the hounds . Relentlessly they covered the ground before him . Bonham sighted the lead animal ; it was larger than the others and led by a length . He aimed the gun a yard ahead and slowly squeezed the trigger . The hammer fell and powder exploded as the shot rang out , hitting the mastiff in the chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even flinch . Bonham closed his eyes and waited . In thirty seconds he would be prey for the hounds . Blake got to the door , which was made of thick oak , four times bolted and twice locked . He quickly began slide away the bolts -- one , two , three , four -- counting as he went . " The key , the key ! " he shouted , searching frantically for its hiding-place . Then , looking down , he spied the key on a small hook . He grabbed it tightly and pushed it into the top lock , turning as fast as he could , knowing he had only seconds before Bonham 's demise . He fumbled in his haste and the key dropped to the floor . He grabbed it again and quickly turned the bottom lock . It was stiff and hard to turn , but opened with a reassuring clunk . He slapped the handle and the great door swung open . Bonham fell backwards into the hall , and Blake was confronted with the sight of the three hounds bounding towards him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the road up the marble steps towards him . Seeing his fate , Blake quickly slammed the door and slid the bolts . There was a loud thud as the door vibrated and shook with the impact of the hound , but it held fast . He heard the dog drop to the ground . There was silence in the sanctuary . Isaac Bonham stared at Blake . " Never be that late again , " Bonham panted . " One more second and I would have said goodbye to this life . "
