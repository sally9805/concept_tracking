Sassy Wanda Sykes is Sassing her way to a career of sassifying . See , Sykes hates that word , and she 's at her funniest when she 's angry . " Sassy to me is a put-down . It 's given to black women . No one calls Ellen DeGeneres sassy . No one calls Robin Williams sassy . And that 's a sassy man , " she says . " Sassy is all attitude and no content . And I 've got something to say . " <P> So much that Sykes feels the need to say it everywhere : a new sitcom on Comedy Central , Wanda Does It ; a book , Yeah , I Said It ; a 31-city comedy big-venue stand-up tour , The Cotton T-Shirt Tour ; a big role in this summer 's Monster-in-Law with Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda ; a gig as a prank-calling puppet on Comedy Central 's Crank Yankers ; and a recurring role on HBO 's Curb Your Enthusiasm . Also , she fixed up her website real nice . <P> Sykes worked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington talent contest in 1987 . She quit her job five years later to move to New York City , where she met Chris Rock , who hired her as a writer for his HBO show . She got her performing break when fellow writer ( and star , as a nonsense-spewing rapper , of the movie Pootie Tang ) Lance Crouther agreed to take her to a work party for HBO 's Inside the NFL , even though he was n't supposed to take a guest . Sykes , who was told to lie low , spent the entire time loudly mocking show host Bob Costas ' inability to admit he does n't know something . To Bob Costas . He was so amused that he gave her an on-air job on Inside the NFL . <P> It 's this fearlessness mixed with constant outrage  --  imagine Larry David with an actual reason to be angry  --  that gives Sykes ' voice its distinct character . In Yeah , I Said It , she writes of the no-win situation faced by less-than-good-looking women : " An ugly woman could cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Did you hear about the ugly scientist that cured cancer ? Yeah , that 's great . You know how she found the cure ? Apparently she looked at the cancer and scared it away . ' " <P> Her righteous indignation has propelled her to No. 14 on ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY 's list of the funniest people in America , and she seems determined to make it into the Top 10 by every medium necessary . <P> Overexposure , however , requires being everywhere , and everywhere includes a whorehouse . For Wanda Does It , a sitcom disguised as a reality show in which the dialogue is improvised from an outline , Sykes tries out a different job every episode , apparently unhappy with the 50 she already holds . And since Sykes is extremely curious about what society deems unacceptable and in particular how to use those things to get herself more attention , she flew to the Chicken Ranch , the legal brothel in Pahrump , Nev. , that was the basis for The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas ( whorehouses , unsurprisingly , sometimes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which aired last week , Sykes was trained by Diamond , a young hooker with a heart of gold . Probably . The heart stuff does n't come up much around Sykes .
