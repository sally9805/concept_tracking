" Okay , now do me , " said the waitress at the Silver Star Cafe . " Tell me whatcha see . " Three hours out of Vegas and six miles from nowhere , the Silver Star was supposed to be southern Nevada 's oldest eating establishment . Its walls were covered with antique tintypes : cowboys lining up for shots of Nockum Stiff , sporting girls in striped tights , a dead rustler with a sign around his neck that read , this is what happens to cattle theifs in Dyer County . I do n't know what I found more disturbing -- -the satisfied grins of the lynch mob , or the fact that they had misspelled thieves . " Quit stallin ' , handsome . " The waitress playfully flicked a dishrag at me . " You already told Luther and Bill their whole life stories just by lookin ' at ' em . " I shrugged . " Those guys were easy . They have tattoos . " " I got tattoos , " she pouted . " I 'm easy . " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen teeth between them , someone playing video games in the room next door , the waitress -- -her name was Meghan -- -and me . It was four o'clock on a Friday : Halloween . " What 'd you say your name was ? " She leaned toward me , baldly hinting where one of those tattoos might be . " Mike . " " Give you some homemade cherry pie , Mike . Now comeon , make a girl happy . " I looked her over . Late thirties , sexy in a **26;701;TOOLONG way , with a C-section scar smiling over her jeans . There was also a recently chipped front tooth and a badly concealed bruise on her neck . She smiled pretty . But every time she looked away , the life went right out of her eyes . With the old men it was mostly a game . With Meghan I 'd have to be careful . If I gave it to her straight , I could forget about seeing the inside of that Wonderbra . Or I could make a girl happy . A night on the trailer-park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullenly away . Meghan 's fleeting look of desolation as she tried to smile me out the front door . Who knows . I could even wind up trading punches with the slimeball who gave her that bruise . But what the hell . " You 're a model . " I winked . " Twenty-seven , right ? " Meghan smiled . " One slice , comin ' right up . " So it 's finally come to this , I thought . Ten years of hard-core training at taxpayers ' expense , just so I could play mind reader in Where-the-hell , Nevada . Will Profile for Food . She picked up my empty plates and bumped the kitchen door open with her ass . " Say , how 'd you get so good at readin ' people , anyh -- - " Then the color drained from her face . Everyone was looking through the front window . Motorcycles flanked the gray hearse as it rumbled down Highway 313 , followed by an old green Jeep Cherokee and a long procession of mourners : Dodges and K-cars with bad mufflers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see them -- -were solemn and confused . " Sweet Jesus , " someone whispered . " Who are they burying ? " I asked . Meghan gave me a pinched expression , letting me know I 'd crossed some invisible line . " Mexican boy , " she murmured . " Six years old . " " Jesus , that 's tragic . " One of the old men snorted . " Damn criminal is what it is . People who let their kids run out in the road -- - " Meghan winced . " Shame on you , Luther . " " It 's folks like them need shamin ' . " He slammed his fist down . " Oughtta be the parents who died instead of the kid . If there was any justice . " I glanced over at him . " I 'm sure there 's a couple of people in that procession who 'd agree with you . " He gave a dry chuckle . " Yeah ? Like who ? " " The parents . " Luther looked away before I did . " What exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody answered . These were local matters , private matters , and my car had Pennsylvania tags . The last of the mourners passed , and now the only sound was tinny music from the game room next door . " Didja see that coffin ? " Bill shook his head . " Best piece o ' furniture them wetbacks own , and it 's goin ' right in the ground . " " You hush now . " Meghan reddened . " They ai n't wetbacks anyhow . " Her voice faltered as a red Ford pickup tore down the highway , its right front tire screaming . For a second I took it for a late mourner . Then the truck braked hard into the parking lot , dragging gray dust behind . Luther scratched his jaw . " Hell , that 's Dale . " The floorboards creaked as Dale came into the diner . He was six and a half feet tall , three hundred pounds on the hoof . His mouth was surprisingly childlike , lost in a brick-red beard . Dale wore shitkicker boots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't look like he was there to check the extinguishers . His right hand was pale and blotched , all gooseflesh . Probably just out of a cast . Every few seconds it flexed and extended , as though he were trying to bring it back to life . " ' Lo , Dale . " The waitress tried to smile . " Rob here ? " His voice was thick and slow . As Dale touched his cap I noticed a deep crease in his left temple . An old scar , badly healed . The words semper fi were stamped on the gold ring on his little finger . Meghan was wringing her hands . " Robbie 's over in the game room . Been here maybe -- -whatya think , Luther ? An hour ? " " Near about . " Luther nodded . " Every day at three , he 's here . " Dale barely saw me as he lumbered past : I was just some guy eating lunch . As he entered the game room , the diner began to breathe again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . " You do n't think -- - " " Reckon I do n't . " Luther 's eyes dropped to his fried apple pie . " Ai n't no trouble of mine . " If Robbie had been a deadbeat gambler or some redneck Romeo with a hard-on for Dale 's sweetheart , I might have agreed . But something that old man said bothered me . Every day at three , he 's here . Three o'clock is when school lets out . I shifted for a better view of the game room . Robbie was small for his age -- -seven or eight , maybe forty pounds . He had to stand on a box to reach the video game controls . His slender legs were clad in metal braces . A brand-new walker stood beside the machine . As Dale 's shadow fell over him , the boy said something too soft to hear . Dale put his hand under the boy 's armpit and lifted him like a puppet . Robbie yelped . " I need my walker . " Dale grabbed the walker , tucked it under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes on Dale . Again he brushed past me without looking . Then Robbie came within reach of my arms , and for one awful second his brown eyes gazed deep into my own . My hand tightened on the brass rail . " Excuse me . " But Dale did n't stop . I turned to the waitress . " Call the police , " I said . " Now . " " Do n't be crazy . " She grabbed at my wrist . " Just do it . " By the time I got to the parking lot , Dale was fumbling for his keys with Robbie pinned beneath his left arm . Whatever he planned to do to the boy , he was damned well going to do in private . I was thirty feet away , walking steady . My palms were sweating . Dale flung the walker into the bed of the truck , where it landed with a dull clatter . Robbie screamed . " Let go ! " Robbie swung his thin legs , clawed at Dale 's shirt . " Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiped Dale 's left eye . The keys flew from Dale 's hand and disappeared under the front tire . " God damn it ! " Dale took the boy 's face in one enormous hand . " Cut this shit out ! Tell me what the fuck she said ! " Robbie bit his lip . " Look at me when I talk to you , Robbie ! " " Let go of me ! You 're not my daddy ! " " Dale . " I was ten feet away . He turned . " Who the hell are you ? " " My name is Mike . " I spoke softly enough to make him lean forward . " Is everything okay ? " " Fuck you care ? " His breathing slowed a little . " I 'm a little worried about Robbie . " I could feel the blood in my temples . Why was I doing this ? I did n't have any authority here , not anymore . And I sure as hell did n't look forward to getting pounded . But Robbie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving a bright red mark on the boy 's cheek . " Never mind about Robbie . He 's fine . " " Come on , Dale . He 's scared out of his mind . " Dale drew back slightly , balancing on the razor 's edge . " Just take it easy , " I said . " And let 's do the right thing . " For a second he seemed about to let go . I reminded myself not to move until he was at least two strides away from the kid . Then we both heard it , a keening sound on the wind . Police sirens . Dale 's face went white . " You son of a bitch . " He pushed the boy hard , trying to get him into the cab . Robbie slipped and collapsed on the pavement . I reached to stop his fall and that pushed the trigger . A moment later Dale hurtled toward me . He drove the first punch -- -a haymaker , straight at my solar plexus . I darted to one side and his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through my lungs . Then he landed a left to my jaw . My head snapped back and the ground swung around me . I was going down . I feinted with my left , hooked the back of his leg with my instep and slammed his chin backward . We both fell hard , but I was ready for it . He was n't . He instinctively threw out his hand to break his fall : the wrong hand . " Motherfucker ! " Dale bellowed , taking three hundred pounds hard on the pavement . By instinct , I reached for my pancake holster ... but of course it was n't there . Dale had a killer look in his eye , and the squad car was still half a mile away . I had to take my shot before he got his feet under him . Throwing all my weight into my stride , I ran up and planted my toe as hard as I could into the cleft of that dent in his skull . The shock traveled all the way to my hip . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and his eyes rolled like he 'd touched lightning . Then his cheek hit the pavement . Blood trickled from his ear . " Okay , that 's enough . " I leaned over , out of breath . " Robbie , stay where you are . It 's gon na ... be all right . " Dale slumped against the side of his truck -- -making a soft sound , like a dove cooing . " I did n't want to do that , " I said . " You were losing control . I had to stop you . " He only looked at me in confusion , as if wondering who the hell I was and what he was doing on the ground . Then , in a clear soft voice , he spoke . " Did you hear that ? " " Hear what ? " " Just then . " His eyes rolled upward . " Did you hear a baby cry ? " At that moment all I could hear were the sirens of a sand-colored Crown Victoria as it pulled to a stop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , " Day early for Sattidy wrasslin ' , ai n't it boys ? " The lead officer , small and compact , wore desert-drab plainclothes . A gold detective 's shield dangled from his worn leather belt . He stood from the vehicle , his narrow yellow eyes checking for danger . His deputy was an aimless-looking goof with fresh acne scars . Both of them wore black armbands and carried twelve-gauge shotguns . The detective 's lips curled in amusement . " Now what 's this looks like to you , Clyde ? " " ' Pears to be dis-orderly conduct , Tippet . " Clyde whistled . " Damn , Dale . You let that little wart of a guy break your hand all over again ? " Dale looked up . " I have to go home now . " " Lieutenant . " I looked Tippet straight in the eye . " My name 's Mike Yeager . I -- - " " I 'll getcher name when I want it . " Tippet sneered . " And keep those hands clear of your body . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no mood for shit . " I held my palms out . " Look , I 'm the one who told the waitress to call in . I saw this man grab that young boy over there , and -- - " " Boy ? " He glanced around . " Ai n't no boy . " I looked back at the tailgate . Robbie was gone . So was the metal walker . " Clyde , you see any boy ' round here ? " " Guess he musta run off . " Clyde nodded back to me . " All right , sir . Need you to turn ' round slow and face the vehicle . Keep your legs apart and put your palms together behind your back . " " You too , Dale . " Tippet kept a tactical distance , a park ranger eyeing a wounded grizzly . " Cassie 's gone , " Dale said with dull certainty . Tippet threw a weary glance at his partner . " We go through this twice a week , Dale . Your daughter ai n't gone nowhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get her . " Dale furrowed his brow . " Somebody said they saw her talking to Robbie . So I thought ... " His voice trailed off . " Mean to tell me that was Robbie McIntosh you grabbed hold of ? " Tippet rolled his eyes . " Dale , for chrissake . " Clyde cleared his throat . " Tip , maybe we ought a call this one in . " Tippet barely nodded . " Dale , if I go check on your daughter , you ai n't gon na give us no trouble -- -right ? " Dale stumbled to his feet . " I got ta look for my Cassie . Maybe she 's home by now . " " Shoulda thought about your little girl before you got in a fight . " " We 'll call the Maidstones for ya . " Clyde circled behind Dale . " They 'll keep a look out for Cassie . " The cuffs trembled in the deputy 's hands as he fumbled to get them around Dale 's huge wrists . I stood still and waited my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell he was doing . With his back to me , it would n't be too much of a job to get the jump on him . I could even try and take that twelve-gauge away if I felt crazy enough . And that bothered me . A dumb local cop can get a man killed . But then there was Tippet , covering his partner with a shotgun on tight choke . He looked like he might enjoy having me resist arrest . " All right , sir . What was that name again ? " The cuffs bit my wrists as Clyde forced them home . " Yeager . Michael Francis Yeager . " " On your way down to Las Vegas , Mr. Yeager ? " " Just came to take pictures of the mountains . " Tippet cocked an eyebrow . " What do you do for a living exactly ? " " Right now exactly nothing . " I glanced over to my car . " My cameras are in the old Nash over there . " A rattlesnake gleam shone in Tippet 's eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my hip pocket . " In my jacket , " I said . The deputy warily plucked out my billfold . " Whatta we got there , Clyde ? " " Outastate license . " He held it up for his partner . " Filla-delf-yuh , P-A . Subject is five foot seven , one hunnert and sixty pounds . Age , forty-two . Black hair , blue eyes . Organ donor . I guess he about donated some organs today . " Tippet frowned . Keep lookin ' . " Clyde continued to flip through the wallet . " Holy Christ . Tip , check this shit out . " " Whatya got ? " " Holy Christ on a mother-lovin ' pony . " Clyde held up the laminated ID card . " This fella 's FBI . " " FBI my ass . " Tippet leaned over Clyde 's shoulder . Then he gave a low whistle . " Well , shit on a brick . That right , Mr. Yeager ? Are you FBI ? " I sighed . " Once upon a time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
