Calvin , Donna and Ralph : revered designers , handy with a hemstitch and all , but getting a bit long in the tooth ( Calvin Klein is 60 , Donna Karan 's 54 and Ralph Lauren 's 63 ) . Why do people who have enough disposable income to drop $200 on a shirt let their parents ' generation tell them how to dress ? Perhaps because the next design oligarchy has not yet clearly emerged . But during Fashion Week in New York City last week , three younger voices made themselves heard over the fray . Marc Jacobs reimagined retro futurism with a bunch of nifty jumpers-and-tights looks . Nicolas Ghesquiere , who designs for Balenciaga , presented difficult but fascinating ensembles , some resembling sea anemones in thigh boots . Narciso Rodriguez championed the pretty with impeccably proportioned dresses and evening gowns . Let the spending begin .  --  By Belinda Luscombe
