One good thing could come from this horror : it could spell the end of the age of irony . For some 30 years  --  roughly as long as the Twin Towers were upright  --  the good folks in charge of America 's intellectual life have insisted that nothing was to be believed in or taken seriously . Nothing was real . With a giggle and a smirk , our chattering classes  --  our columnists and pop culture makers  --  declared that detachment and personal whimsy were the necessary tools for an oh-so-cool life . Who but a slobbering bumpkin would think , " I feel your pain " ? The ironists , seeing through everything , made it difficult for anyone to see anything . The consequence of thinking that nothing is real  --  apart from prancing around in an air of vain stupidity  --  is that one will not know the difference between a joke and a menace . <P> No more . The planes that plowed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were real . The flames , smoke , sirens  --  real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all real . I feel your pain  --  really . <P> History occurs twice , crack the wise guys quoting Marx : first as tragedy , then as farce . Who would believe such a thing except someone who has never experienced tragedy ? Are you looking for something to take seriously ? Begin with evil . The fact before our eyes is that a group of savage zealots took the sweet and various lives of those ordinarily traveling from place to place , ordinarily starting a day of work or  --  extraordinarily  --  coming to help and rescue others . Freedom ? That real enough for you ? Everything we cling to in our free and sauntering country was imperiled by the terrorists . Destruction was real ; no hedging about that . Hans Christian Andersen wrote that famous fairy tale about The Most Incredible Thing , a beautiful , intricate clock that was smashed to bits by an ax , which act was then judged to be the most incredible thing . No fairy tales required this week . Where the Twin Towers were , there is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the most serious things were not to be taken seriously . Movies featuring characters who " see dead people " or TV hosts who talk to the " other side " suggested that death was not to be seen as real . If one doubted its reality before last week , that is unlikely to happen again . Which brings us to the more amorphous zones of reality , such as grief and common sorrow . When the white dust settles , and the bereaved are alone in their houses , there will be nothing but grief around them , and nothing is more real than that . In short , people may at last be ready to say what they wholeheartedly believe . The kindness of people toward others in distress is real . There is nothing to see through in that . Honor and fair play ? Real . And the preciousness of ordinary living is real as well  --  all to be taken seriously , perhaps , in a new and chastened time . The greatness of the country : real . The anger : real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
