<p> PRESIDENT BUSH 'S new Supreme Court nominee was a historic first after all : the first to be announced on TV dead center in prime time , smack in the cross hairs of " I Want to Be a Hilton . " It was also one of the hastiest court announcements in memory , abruptly sprung a week ahead of the White House 's original timetable . The agenda of this rushed showmanship  --  to change the subject in Washington  --  could not have been more naked . But the president would have had to nominate Bill Clinton to change this subject . <p> When a conspiracy is unraveling , and it 's every liar and his lawyer for themselves , the story takes on a momentum of its own . When the conspiracy is , at its heart , about the White House 's twisting of the intelligence used to sell the American people a war  --  and its desperate efforts to cover up that flimflam once the W.M.D. cupboard proved bare and the war went south  --  the story will not end until the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only 36 hours after the John Roberts unveiling , The Washington Post nudged him aside to second position on its front page . Leading the paper instead was a scoop concerning a State Department memo circulated the week before the outing of Joseph Wilson 's wife , the C.I.A . officer Valerie Plame , in literally the loftiest reaches of the Bush administration  --  on Air Force One . The memo , The Post reported , marked the paragraph containing information about Ms. Plame with an S for secret . So much for the cover story that no one knew that her identity was covert . <p> But the scandal has metastasized so much at this point that the forgotten man Mr. Bush did not nominate to the Supreme Court is as much a window into the White House 's panic and stonewalling as its haste to put forward the man he did . When the president decided not to replace Sandra Day O'Connor with a woman , why did he pick a white guy and not nominate the first Hispanic justice , his friend Alberto Gonzales ? Mr. Bush was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who find him soft on abortion ) or left ( who find him soft on the Geneva Conventions ) . It 's Mr. Gonzales 's proximity to this scandal that inspires real fear . <p> As White House counsel , he was the one first notified that the Justice Department , at the request of the C.I.A. , had opened an investigation into the outing of Joseph Wilson 's wife . That notification came at 8:30 p.m. on Sept. 29 , 2003 , but it took Mr. Gonzales 12 more hours to inform the White House staff that it must " preserve all materials " relevant to the investigation . This 12-hour delay , he has said , was sanctioned by the Justice Department , but since the department was then run by John Ashcroft , a Bush loyalist who refused to recuse himself from the Plame case , inquiring Senate Democrats would examine this 12-hour delay as closely as an 18 1/2-minute tape gap . " Every good prosecutor knows that any delay could give a culprit time to destroy the evidence , " said Senator Charles Schumer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed almost two years ago . A new Gonzales confirmation process now would have quickly devolved into a neo-Watergate hearing . Mr. Gonzales was in the thick of the Plame investigation , all told , for 16 months . <p> Thus is Mr. Gonzales 's Supreme Court aspiration the first White House casualty of this affair . It wo n't be the last . When you look at the early timeline of this case , rather than the latest investigatory scraps , two damning story lines emerge and both have legs . <p> The first : for half a year White House hands made the fatal mistake of thinking they could get away with trashing the Wilsons scot-free . They thought so because for nearly three months after the July 6 , 2003 , publication of Mr. Wilson 's New York Times Op-Ed article and the outing of his wife in a Robert Novak column , there was no investigation at all . Once the unthreatening Ashcroft-controlled investigation began , there was another comfy three months . <p> Only after that did Patrick Fitzgerald , the special counsel , take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators hustle to seek Air Force One phone logs and did Mr. Bush feel compelled to hire a private lawyer . But by then the conspirators , drunk with the hubris characteristic of this administration , had already been quite careless . <p> It was during that pre-Fitzgerald honeymoon that Scott McClellan declared that both Karl Rove and Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , Lewis Libby , had personally told him they were " not involved in this "  --  neither leaking any classified information nor even telling any reporter that Valerie Plame worked for the C.I.A . Matt Cooper has now written in Time that it was through his " conversation with Rove " that he " learned for the first time that Wilson 's wife worked at the C.I.A . " Maybe it all depends on what the meaning of " telling , " " involved " or " this " is . If these people were similarly cute with F.B.I . agents and the grand jury , they 've got an obstruction-of-justice problem possibly more grave than the hard-to-prosecute original charge of knowingly outing a covert agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fitzgerald 's investigation  --  is the period at the very outset when those plotting against Mr. Wilson felt safest of all : those eight days in July 2003 between the Wilson Op-Ed , which so infuriated the administration , and the retaliatory Novak column . It was during that long week , on a presidential trip to Africa , that Colin Powell was seen on Air Force One brandishing the classified State Department memo mentioning Valerie Plame , as first reported by The New York Times . <p> That memo may have been the genesis of an orchestrated assault on the Wilsons . That the administration was then cocky enough and enraged enough to go after its presumed enemies so systematically can be found in a similar , now forgotten attack that was hatched on July 15 , the day after the publication of Mr. Novak 's column portraying Mr. Wilson as a girlie man dependent on his wife for employment . <p> On that evening 's broadcast of ABC 's " World News Tonight , " American soldiers in Falluja spoke angrily of how their tour of duty had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumsfeld told them they were going home . Soon the Drudge Report announced that ABC 's correspondent , Jeffrey Kofman , was gay . Matt Drudge told Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post at the time that " someone from the White House communications shop " had given him that information . <p> Mr. McClellan denied White House involvement with any Kofman revelation , a denial now worth as much as his denials of White House involvement with the trashing of the Wilsons . Identifying someone as gay is n't a crime in any event , but the " outing " of Mr. Kofman ( who turned out to be openly gay ) almost simultaneously with the outing of Ms. Plame points to a pervasive culture of revenge in the White House and offers a clue as to who might be driving it . As Joshua Green reported in detail in The Atlantic Monthly last year , a recurring feature of Mr. Rove 's political campaigns throughout his career has been the questioning of an " opponent 's sexual orientation . " <p> THE second narrative to be unearthed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindictiveness against anyone questioning the war . On May 1 , 2003 , Mr. Bush celebrated " Mission Accomplished . " On May 29 , Mr. Bush announced that " we found the weapons of mass destruction . " On July 2 , as attacks increased on American troops , Mr. Bush dared the insurgents to " bring ' em on . " But the mission was not accomplished , the weapons were not found and the enemy kept bringing ' em on . It was against this backdrop of mounting desperation on July 6 that Mr. Wilson went public with his incriminating claim that the most potent argument for the war in the first place , the administration 's repeated intimations of nuclear Armageddon , involved twisted intelligence . <p> Mr. Wilson 's charge had such force that just three days after its publication , Mr. Bush radically revised his language about W.M.D. 's . Saddam no longer had W.M.D. 's ; he had a W.M.D. " program . " Right after that George Tenet suddenly decided to release a Friday-evening statement saying that the 16 errant words about African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 2003 State of the Union address  --  even though those 16 words could and should have been retracted months earlier . By the next State of the Union , in January 2004 , Mr. Bush would retreat completely , talking not about finding W.M.D. 's or even W.M.D. programs , but about " weapons of mass destruction-related program activities . " <p> In July 2005 , there are still no W.M.D. 's , and we 're still waiting to hear the full story of how , in the words of the Downing Street memo , the intelligence was fixed to foretell all those imminent mushroom clouds in the run-up to war in Iraq . The two official investigations into America 's prewar intelligence have both found that our intelligence was wrong , but neither has answered the question of how the administration used that wrong intelligence in selling the war . That issue was pointedly kept out of the charter of the Silberman-Robb commission ; the Senate Intelligence Committee promised to get to it after the election but conspicuously has not . <p> The real crime here remains the sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without it , there would n't have been a third-rate smear campaign against an obscure diplomat , a bungled cover-up and a scandal that  --  like the war itself  --  has no exit strategy that will not inflict pain . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
