She started in the bathhouses of Manhattan and sang a famous goodbye serenade to Johnny Carson . Along the way Bette Midler , 60 , has built a career out of making retro cool , from films like For the Boys to her latest CD , Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook . The Divine Miss M spoke with TIME 's Richard Zoglin about Mae West , Las Vegas and the next generation of divas . <P> WHAT ATTRACTED YOU TO PEGGY LEE ? I missed a lot of people growing up . I never saw her work live . Never saw her on television . But Barry Manilow sent me these songs , and I was really kind of stunned . In my excavation of cool  --  like Miles and Chet and the beatniks  --  she never came up . The women never came up . It was always the men . And she was cooler than any of them . <P> ARE YOU TRYING TO REPRODUCE HER OR DO YOUR OWN THING ? She was very restrained as a singer . Very stripped down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get overly dramatic . Because I am a little bit overly emotional . But I 'm not Mariah  --  I 'm not an overembellisher . I like the song to be basically about the lyric and the melody rather than about my musicality . <P> WHAT SINGERS INFLUENCED YOU EARLY ON ? I was crazy about Mae West . I used to see old films of hers , and she made a very big impression on me because she was very funny , she was very risqu and she was also very beautiful in a kind of blowsy way . And she was very musical  --  she basically sang the blues . <P> IS THERE A FEMINIST THEME IN THE ARTISTS YOU CELEBRATE ? Yes , I think there is , really . I 've always liked kind of independent spirits , because they 're not fake . They 've kind of accepted the fact that this is the way for them , and they 're not going to hide their light . I 've always felt myself a little bit outside the mainstream . My parents never told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always insisted that I was going to work for a living , that I did n't have to get married , that I did n't have to take any old job , that I should fight for something that I really loved . <P> SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEXT ? I 'm creating diva boot camp . I 'm going to tell all the little girls who want to be a big diva how to laugh . <P> YOU USED TO TOUR WITH BARRY MANILOW . PEOPLE SOMETIMES MAKE FUN OF HIM AS MR. ' 70S SCHMALTZ . WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT HIM ? I love his sense of humor . I love his devotion to the craft and his devotion to this kind of music . That music is really the music of his childhood . One of my crackpot theories is that you never really get over that music . He 's never really budged off his music , which I think is really fascinating . When I was flagged , I said , Oh , maybe I better do something else , and did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So good for him . <P> ARE YOU GOING TO TOUR AGAIN ? I would like to go to Europe with my show . But things are so unsettled in the world , and I kind of do n't really know what to do . I 'd like to get to 100 performances . I 'm up to about 87 . And I 'm talking to people in Las Vegas because I think it would be nice to get off the road and not waste so much gas .
