Baby Mozart , meet alumni mania . A new series of DVDs for tots features footage of college marching bands and mascots . For budding fans of , say , the University of Texas , there 's not only a Baby Longhorn video from Team Baby Entertainment but also a new Mascotopia mobile that plays Eyes of Texas . Toddlers with more literary tastes can drool over mini tomes such as Mascot Books ' Let 's Go Illini ! Early applications , anyone ?
