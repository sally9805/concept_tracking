<p> " There is nothing like dance , " said Gerald Arpino , artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet , as he watched his company rehearsing Frederick Ashton 's " The Wedding Bouquet " a few weeks ago . " It 's the fourth dimension . If I could , I 'd still just be a dancer . I stopped performing in the early 1960s , but of course you never really stop . " <p> Arpino , now 81  --  and determined to waltz around any question regarding his age  --  was , by all reports , a thrilling dancer  --  small , fleet , perfectly proportioned  --  a real natural with an impeccable classical line . He is also , in the words of Clive Barnes  --  longtime dance critic of the New York Times and now critic for the New York Post  --  " a very fine choreographer who has often been underrated . " <p> Of course , for the last 15 years , Arpino has been the stalwart visionary , who , in the face of monumental obstacles , has not only patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-founded with Robert Joffrey in the 1950s , but has nurtured it to the point where it is once again triumphant on an international scale . <p> The Joffrey 's widely acclaimed return visit to New York 's Metropolitan Opera House earlier this month as part of the Lincoln Center Festival  --  where it joined with Britain 's Birmingham Royal Ballet and K-Ballet of Japan in a centennial celebration of Sir Frederick Ashton , the great English choreographer  --  marked the culmination of a decade spent re-establishing itself in Chicago . It was just the latest turning point in a half-century of the high drama that invariably marks the history of any major arts organization . But for Arpino , this brief homecoming was clearly both a powerful vindication and a source of tremendous pride . <p> The return to New York also was a deeply emotional experience . What follows are excerpts from a diary I kept as I followed Arpino and the Joffrey dancers on their great adventure . <p> THURSDAY , JULY 1 , IN CHICAGO <p> Dressed in black slacks , black turtleneck and stylish black suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's steamy , column-challenged studio on South Wabash to observe rehearsals for the three works by Ashton that will be presented in New York . As he takes a seat on his favorite chair , his concentration instantly clicks into high gear . He is working closely with Cameron Basden and Adam Sklute , who have just been named assistant artistic directors , and Chartel Arthur and Mark Goldweber , gifted ballet masters who are essentially the living software of the company and carry all of the choreography in the troupe 's repertory in their heads . All four were Joffrey dancers , and there is a clear sense that Arpino is beginning to ensure his legacy through them . <p> " I think everyone in New York is curious about the Joffrey now , " he says . " They always found us very endearing , and they loved our repertoire  --  we did things no other company did . But we never had the same big financial support that American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet had . <p> " I wish we could bring more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works and Jerome Robbins works and Arpino  --  so audiences would be reminded of our range . But I am just so proud of the company . Look at the way my dancers work things out together he is watching as two women who share a duet test a tricky move . I really love the interchange between the artists . <p> " My dancers are very self-correcting , and much freer than dancers were in the past . The secret is to let them discover their own artistry through me  --  not to impose anything on them . I turn the movement over to them and see what extra things they can bring to it . " <p> The conversation returns to the upcoming New York trip . <p> " I want New York to see that Arpino was able to maintain the company after Bob 's death in 1988 . We 've gone through thick and thin to survive . But if you have a vision and a goal , and you maintain your concentration and your faith , it will all work out . I believe in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman of the board , although having one of those is a big help . " He laughs . " Of course it 's 99 percent hard work , but it 's also good to have a few archangels flying around all the time . " <p> TUESDAY , JULY 6 , IN NEW YORK <p> Stage managers Michael Andrew Curry and Katherine Selig , along with the masterful lighting director Kevin Dreyer and wardrobe manager Nicole Burchfield , have already been at work for a day , getting acclimated to the Metropolitan Opera House 's sprawling backstage and its maze of underground dressing rooms , studios and other facilities . <p> Board members David and Barbara Levy Kipper , who were instrumental in getting the Joffrey to move to Chicago , have just checked into their hotel . <p> There is a company class at 10 a.m. , but several dancers already in town have decided to visit one of the many hot New York studios for a change of pace  --  particularly Steps , on the Upper West Side , not far from Lincoln Center . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Adam Sklute , who notes that the Joffrey 's last performance in New York was in 1994 , at the New York State Theatre , also in Lincoln Center . " And right now I think the dancers are checking out their competition in the other companies . I think they are very happy about having this exposure and Jerry Arpino has tried not to put the weight of the world on their shoulders for this engagement . He just talked to them about what a wonderful opportunity it was to present this program . Of course there is a certain tension . " <p> Michael Levine , who has danced with the Joffrey since its New York days , joins in , and says he hopes the return visit to the city will " give the younger members of the company a real sense of the troupe 's history and put us back in the international arena . " <p> The dress rehearsal goes relatively smoothly . Six members of the company will represent the Joffrey tonight , opening the program with the very difficult pair of trios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , JULY 7 <p> " Now I 'm really home , " says an emotional Arpino , exiting the Parker Meridian Hotel on 56th Street , just off Seventh Avenue , and stopping to look at the back entrance to City Center , the Moorish-style building that once housed the Shriners and for decades served as home to the Joffrey . " I spent so many years of my life in that building and on this street . " <p> Accompanied by Arpino 's young , patient , well-organized artistic assistant , Greg Stuart  --  a New York dancer who has worked at the Joffrey School  --  we hop into a cab for the ride from midtown to 10th Street and Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village . We are headed to the Joffrey Ballet School ( now a totally separate entity from the company ) , where Edith D'Addario , its director for more than 40 years , still rules the roost , keeps the books , watches over the little bunheads ( and their mothers ) and keeps Arpino apprised of potential talent for the company . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaiani  --  the lovely dancer from the former Soviet republic of Georgia  --  and put her on scholarship . ( Full disclosure : Mrs. D. , as she is called , also was the fearsome presence who took my money for classes when , throughout my teens , I studied at the school . ) <p> Arpino opts to climb the three flights of stairs to the office ; he recalls that he once spent an afternoon trapped in the tiny elevator in this old building . He tells stories , too , of how he and Joffrey spent a couple of years living  --  illegally  --  in a small room behind their studio , taking showers and eating meals at the nearby apartment of a mother of one of the Joffrey 's dancers . <p> " From that back room , we could watch Lotte Lenya rehearsing ' The Threepenny Opera , ' " Arpino recalls . " It was a great time  --  and we would n't have had a company if we did n't survive that way . We had such energy ; I remember painting the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists helped out other artists then , which is the way it should be . " <p> There are hugs all around . Mrs. D. is as sharp and meticulously coiffed as ever , though a bit more frail . She and Arpino chat , and she introduces him to some of the new teachers on staff for the summer session . Former dancer and veteran teacher Dorothy ( " The Screamer " ) Lister  --  with a voice straight out of " Guys &; Dolls "  --  stops in to reminisce . Little has changed here , except the addition of air conditioning . And the rent . The studios , once leased for $250 per month , now cost more than $10,000 . <p> Heading back uptown for rehearsal at the Met , Arpino observes : " New York feels like a pneumatic drill . Chicago has a good , sustainable energy  --  the kind that does n't debilitate you . " <p> The dancers seem both tired and nervous today . Not only are they rehearsing for the Met programs , but also they are squeezing in rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nevada . During a run-through of " Les Patineurs " ( " The Skaters " ) , which will be be performed Thursday night , Masayoshi Onuki , the 22-year-old whose airy jumps and feathery legwork lend a special quality to the role of the Boy in Blue , drops to the floor with a severe leg cramp . Arpino stays in his chair and lets others attend him . If he is beginning to panic , he does n't show it . <p> The rehearsal continues , with Arpino homing in on particular moments that need to be " cleaned up . " He also tells John Gluckman , a buoyant , boyishly handsome dancer and terrific performer , that he could use a haircut . <p> Basden reminds the dancers to " check out the stage wings " so that they are comfortable about their exits and entrances . And then there is a brief break before the dancers begin putting on costumes and makeup for the dress rehearsal of " A Wedding Bouquet . " <p> Sitting in the all-but-empty theater before the rehearsal begins , Arpino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and immediately moves toward her . <p> " Mary , Mary Whitney ! " he exclaims , giving her a big bear hug . Whitney served as marketing director for the company from 1971 to 1992 and according to Arpino , " she was the best . " <p> The company looks beautiful and confident as Christian Holder , a former Joffrey star , joins the cast to speak Gertrude Stein 's witty text for " A Wedding Bouquet . " When the rehearsal is over , Arpino , ever a stickler for detail , climbs the steps to the stage and asks to have the tablecloths arranged more artfully . It will be several more hours before the audience files into the theater . The Joffrey will close the program tonight . <p> The company  --  which has probably been on its toes for 12 hours by the time it faces its public  --  is superb . <p> THURSDAY , JULY 8 <p> The big day is here . The Joffrey has this evening 's program all to itself . Tickets have been selling exceptionally well . At an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing such a beautiful job " the night before , and adds : " Of course you will be even better tonight . " <p> Resting between rehearsals , Jennifer Goodman , one of the handful of dancers who moved from New York to Chicago a decade ago , talks about Arpino : " He is the person who has been there since Year One , the one who crossed the country in a station wagon as part of the first company . I never had the opportunity to work with Mr. Joffrey , so Mr. Arpino is my connection to the very beginning of it all . " <p> Arpino takes his seat near the computer board temporarily set up in the center of the orchestra section . His ballet masters and associates are at his side . He is wearing his red , white and blue " U.S.A. " team jacket , always a sign that serious business is under way . <p> The dress rehearsal of " Les Patineurs " goes badly for Onuki . He may be holding back and saving his energy for that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick with nerves . Arpino says little , except to make sure that Calvin Kitten , who also dances the role , will be ready to step in if necessary . He clearly hopes that " Ma , " as Onuki is called , will perform . <p> And he seems to trust his own sixth sense about dancers and what makes them tick , so he is proceeding without making any radical changes , even though " Les Patineurs " will be the first piece on the program and set the tone for this crucial evening . Arpino appears to have made his peace with whatever the fates have in store . <p> With little time left before the curtain , Arpino decides not to go to the dinner party being hosted by a board member who lives in a posh apartment in the Sherry Netherland . But Pam Strobel , chief administrative officer of Exelon and chairman of the Joffrey board  --  along with Joffrey 's executive director Jon Teeuwissen and others  --  meet and greet the many guests , all of them longtime Joffrey fans . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz in the air . " Les Patineurs " is beguiling , with the dancers in high spirits , performing exquisitely . " Ma " attacks his role with a more laid-back quality than usual and gets through every challenge . ( He will be singled out in the New York Times review . ) <p> By the time the entire program draws to a close , the audience is in a high state of excitement . Arpino , who was not at all sure that he would take a bow with the company , decides he will after all . The cast bows , then the sparkling conductor , Leslie B. Dunner , joins them . And finally , beckoned by leading dancer Maia Wilkins , Arpino emerges from the wings . He bows deeply  --  his hands clasped over his heart  --  before slowly walking out of the limelight . <p> Downstairs in the dressing room area , crowds of well-wishers begin to gather  --  many of them former dancers and choreographers for the company . Arpino is beaming but shy . Nigel Redden , director of the Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Arpino pluckily asks : " So , when are we coming back ? " <p> " I 'm working on it , " says Redden . " I really mean that . I already have an idea . " <p> There is a post-show party at another board member 's apartment . But Arpino , heading for the exit door , sees a face in the crowd and stops instantly . <p> " Christina , Christina ! " he cries , embracing a small , slender woman who looks like a former dancer . " This is Christina Giannini , the Mother Teresa of the costume world . She gave us costumes for free when we had no money , and we still have them ! There would be no Joffrey without you  --  we 'd have been bare-assed . That kind of love , that kind of kindness  --  how can you reciprocate ? We had some great times , did n't we ? " <p> The elation continues , as Arpino begins humming " follow the yellow brick road " as he walks into the muggy evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes for the company another 10 years down the road . <p> " Well , five years from now , I 'd like to have a building with a sign as big as Steppenwolf 's that just says ' The Joffrey . ' I see a full building , where we can have three good studios with no obstructing poles  --  I 've been pole-arized all my life , in every rehearsal studio  --  and offices , and two toilets , and all our costumes and sets and archives , so that people can study our history . I see a whole complex that reflects what the Joffrey is all about  --  a real American company , and the only one to develop as we did . <p> " But my main vision is the audience . I just want to get them in to see the ballet , to have them come the way they do for sports teams . That 's when we 'll know we 're OK. "
