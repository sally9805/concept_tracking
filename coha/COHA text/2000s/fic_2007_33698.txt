Chapter One Kate They were stopped on a hill at a red light , Kate Riley and a man . There was always a man . Did it matter which ? Perhaps it might have mattered if she had been willing . Or not afraid . They were stopped on a steep hill , the red light at the top crowning the intersection , with several cars in front , so that theirs-it was new and dark-tilted sharply up toward the summit . Until she glanced to her left there were the usual sounds of afternoon traffic in the town of Monterey . The sun was out , a temperate day , an ordinary moment from the flow of impersonal and familiar time . Until she saw the young woman there was sound , the calico busyness of suburban scene , the smell of new leather , the man beside her , his hand resting lightly atop her-she could not see his face , but she noted with satisfaction the space filled in by his shape . He had just concluded a long sentence with her name as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , to some extent , she knew she did not need , even while she took pleasure in its small ritualized caress . Then it all vanished , or it dropped its claims , ceased to move ; the camera had stopped forward action , and the moment fell from above like a single pebble into her hand . On the sidewalk to her left was a young woman . She alone went on , lived on . A black Labrador sat beside the woman , alert , watching the traffic , his nose lifted slightly , his head shifting one way then another-he seemed to be hoping that someone would come along to help . The young woman was slender , even ... cadaverous . Her left hipbone jutted out and up at a distorted angle , and the modern , hip-hugging slacks she wore struck a sad note of complicity-she was blind and could neither see and enjoy her conformity with the fashion of the day , nor realize how slightly , fatally it missed the mark . Someone else-not family , Kate could not imagine a family-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing for her . Kate could not imagine a family because of the dignity ; dignity of that sort was self-generated and independent . Dignity could not be borrowed , it was wrung from the smallest of acts repeated over time . The cropped shirt revealed a swath of tummy , flat and pale , not unattractive-men liked looking without being seen , yes , Kate thought , even the man sitting next to me , all of them . The young woman 's hair had been cut with ease of care-or utility-in mind . The eye locations were shadowed , like charcoal smudges , and sunken in against the nose in the way that was typical of people blind from birth . It was as if the muscles surrounding the eyes , having never been called to action , retreated permanently . With her left hand she gripped the animal 's heavy leather harness as she tugged a plastic bag over her right hand , using her teeth in the end . There was something wrong with the arm ... it kept springing up , bending inward , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she half-knelt , half-squatted on the curb , all awkward limbs and angles ; this girl had more than simple blindness to deal with . But there was something exciting , even aesthetic about her distortions-a figure in a dream by Picasso . In fact , the whole thing became a marvelous , lurid dance , and Kate was completely transfixed by the sightless cadaver with her one wing and her dog so true . Kate glanced ahead , up the hill ; the light had still not changed . In the town of Monterey dogs had to be leashed ; they had to be cleaned up after by their owners . The first was a municipal code , and the second simply a local code of conduct encouraged by discreet signs and the occasional plastic bag dispenser in parks and along popular walkways . The young woman 's Seeing Eye dog had defecated in the gutter . It had never crossed Kate 's mind , or she had never associated this natural function with Seeing Eye dogs who were immune , like priests and nuns and doctors , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left by the Labrador were round and hard , and these attributes , combined with the steep slope , had sent them rolling downhill about four or five feet . Her hand sheathed in the plastic made a sweep of the gutter-nothing . Again , she swept the area where she knew her dog had hunched moments earlier and where she naturally estimated his leavings should be found . Beside her the Labrador waited , perhaps embarrassed by what he had done , confused by her actions , worried . But Kate could see that he trusted his mistress , despite the long delay , or that he was at least willing to put up with things as they were . The light would never change ... Kate thought about mentioning what she was witnessing to the man beside her , but even before the thought had concluded she decided that she did not want him to see it . Who would want to share so remarkable a moment ? But she could not share it , either . It was like trying to call out in the middle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative . Now the young woman dropped clumsily to both knees , the one normal arm and hand still linked to the dog 's rectangular harness , and the other , the wing fluttering out beyond the safety of the gutter into the actual lane where cars , which had turned right from the cross street above , were now passing with the swift , carefree momentum of descent . Down down down they rushed toward her innocent arm ... and just below , out of reach , the three brown stools sat like three blind mice . Christ , let it go , Kate Riley thought , just let it go . Surely , you are not required ... you may excuse yourself . The light changed . Time resumed , gathering its skirts and fleeing before them . The car surged forward , the seat pressing itself with the sudden authority of the present tense into Kate 's body . You are here , it said , now , it asserted . But she thought that she would look back , she felt sure that she would look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some imagined , allegorical remnant of Kate Riley would ask that they stop ... and she would get out of the car , cross over , be the one the dog waited for , the person who was going to help . And Kate was aware , she marveled , that she did not look back . She felt herself to be in a kind of shock . She could not even turn her head . That was the thing that surprised her most-that she could not even make herself look back , there was so little will left , there was so little will left ... Because it was Kate who was in the grip of her own momentum , it was she who sped down down down into the broken wings of innocents . Are you afraid ? His question as they passed under the green light , which hung like heavy mistletoe over their heads . She kissed him . Brave Kate . Or perhaps it was only that she was aware of behaving bravely . She was pretty that day-on the thinner side of things-and felt not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bestow a kiss . She was important , too ; that day she was more important than he , more important than anyone they passed . Even the blind girl . And they arrived at the hospital precisely on time . June 3rd , 1970 . Before the days of CT-scans and MRIS . Before they could look inside without making an actual entry , without making themselves an instrument of scientific faith . His first name was Jim ... he was important , they were all so important , but she could not even remember his last name . It was a small Catholic hospital with a reputation for decent , workmanlike medicine . Jim had urged something more cutting-edge , a large medical center with a university attached , but Kate insisted on the unpretentious , and since she knew that he secretly approved of that , and as it was n't his brain about to be probed-she could n't help but note-he acquiesced . The sixties had only just concluded ; faded bumper stickers continued to announce small is beautiful . And though she had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough or idle enough to indulge in it , Jim , her newest one , had the philosopher 's fondness for pretty ideas . Under the hospital porte-cochere , he turned off the engine and strode with a masculine sense of purpose inside , long legs , arms pumping easily back and forth . She liked the way he walked , for that day she was his purpose . Five minutes later at her door stood Jim with a nurse pushing a wheelchair . Kate made some jocular remark-it 's not my legs , it 's my head that hurts-and they smiled , relieved and impressed-brave Kate-and said their lines , reaffirming that today was her day , today Kate Riley was special and everything about Kate overruled , and from everything Kate would be excused . It was just as she had fantasized it , the whole thing , the whole wonderful farce , and so real that , now more often than not , she found herself believing it . Most of the rooms they passed were doubles , a vinyl accordion wall separating patients , but an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airy , wash-worn , hospital gown lay waiting on the coverlet , along with a shrink-wrapped plastic tub containing a cup , straws , toothbrush and paste , comb , hospital socks with a white rubber chevron pattern on their soles , the kind they make for toddlers , a turquoise aspirator , some brochures , and the ubiquitous bean-shaped vomit dish . Jim placed her overnight duffel bag near the bed and said , " I 'll be right back . " She felt a sudden hollowing in her stomach-was he going to make a call ? Now ? Was he actually going to place a call now to the office ? Would the new secretary be there , Sandra in her summer sandals ? Did she know , she must know , about the headaches , the blackouts , the exploratory surgery ? They all must know . Surely he was excused ... somewhere she had heard that thought before , somewhere recently ... " Ca n't it wait ? " she asked . " My head , it feels as if a horse has kicked me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but clean , very clean , with eyes that were always gazing a little too deeply for comfort , especially at that moment as he tried to be intensely comforting . He was so sincere that , under different circumstances , she would have laughed . " I thought you were off this deadline ... did n't they get someone else to do the piece ? You promised ... " " Kate . I 'm just going to the restroom . " She stared back at him . He was the purest of them all . " Oh you . " By the time he returned she had already changed into the gown , arranging herself with poignant neatness beneath the covers , like a little girl waiting to be tucked in . " My hair , " she said , not really thinking of it yet-cueing it up . " It will grow back , exactly as it is now , " he said , lifting the cool heavy mass , rolling his hand back and forth beneath it , then he must have checked himself ; it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize . And again Kate remembered why she liked this man . Behind his chair there was a window and through its upper half she could see yellow California hills studded with live oaks , blue sky , a single cloud stretched and flattened by the wind off the sea , and the sea itself , just a slim wedge of blue-gray . She would remember that scene , the colors , the one long cloud , for the rest of her life . If she lay down partially she did not have to see through the lower half of the window where a cemetery spread in tufted , green undulations down to the river that flowed to the nearby sea , though even then , during that first hour in the hospital , she did not feel its genuine weight , its very real pull , and avoiding it was a matter of pretense-part of the show . Later on a nurse came in carrying a white enamel tray , and in it , several items : scissors , a razor , tweezers , electric clippers , a tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear plastic bag , a tiny paper cup containing a single pill . " Would you like a sedative ? It helps to relax . " Kate looked at the neatly folded towel draped over the nurse 's forearm like a barmaid 's , and smiled . " No . " " Yes , " said Jim at the same time . They laughed . " Well , I need one , " he added , still smiling in a way that was meant to be boyish and pleasing . When Kate had moved to the stool and the plastic smock was snapped around her neck , Jim rose . They had agreed beforehand that he would go away during the haircut , and while he fished out the new hat-a light blue cashmere beret-she brushed her hair into a single bundle and bound it with the rubber band . Then he stepped outside the door and waited . Arrangements had already been made with a wig man over the hill who worked quickly and expertly with human hair . Jim was to take the hair to him immediately , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital in a week the wig would be ready-or at least that was the plan . " I 'm sorry , " said the nurse . " Well ... " Kate offered a light , ecclesiastical shrug , accepting fate with the equanimity of a nun . " It 's beautiful hair . " " My grandmother 's , " she murmured as if in a dream . Then she closed her eyes as the scissors made their way through the thick bundle . The sound of the scissors laboring , a slick chunking sound , was unique in all the world . Then it was over . The nurse placed the hair carefully in the plastic bag , and handed it out to Jim who departed without a word . " Do you want to see ? " the nurse asked as she took her seat again . " Yes . " In her excitement Kate grabbed the mirror . " Oh . " She pulled what was left of her hair out to the side , shook her head , and tugged again at the dark ragged halo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , well now , who do I look like ? " Fiddling with the clippers in the tray , the nurse seemed to understand that she was audience , not participant . " That blind girl with her choppy hair , that 's who I look like . How strange . I wonder what it would be like to be blind . " And then she thought about that as a possibility . The nurse was staring at her . " I 'm ready , " Kate said . Again with the scissors until it was uniformly short , then out came the clippers , which clacked sharply before settling into a steady buzz , mowing front to back , front to back , the cold fingertips of the tines vibrating and the clumps of hair dropping like small furry animals she was giving birth to , one after another , except that there was nothing to them , they were all hair . Now the nurse-her nametag said Betty-plump , motherly Betty would not allow the mirror . " Let me use the razor first , Mrs. Riley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's naked scalp her palms were warm and intimate , and she seemed proud of her work as she spread the shaving gel and drew the razor about , making short orderly paths . A warm wet towel at the end , some antiseptic lotion , and Nurse Betty was finished . " I think I 'd like to be alone , " Kate said in a quivery voice , " seeing for the first time . " Betty offered an understanding nod , " Of course , " sweeping up the bodiless fur creatures , letting the door close behind her with a distinctly soft regret . On the tray table the mirror lay face down ; Kate picked it up and looked , instantly casting her gaze to the yellow hills , the one long cloud , then down at the squares of gray linoleum , crawling back up to her hand holding the mirror , to the mirror itself , irresistibly turning it . " You . " She was thirty-nine , and it was the first time she had seen her face , not as someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a true , if strangely static , event . When you had no hair it was n't your scalp you noticed , it was your face . And hers was a tired face , a hard face , a face she did not recognize except as someone she had seen once long ago on a street or in a crowd . Or maybe in that distant doctor 's office ... maybe that was the last time Kate could bear to see the woman she was . The eyes looked smaller , the lips thin and drawn down , the wrinkles were determined , there for the duration , and not at all evanescent as she had made them for so long through the eyes of others . A face of certain experience-those words came to mind . Even the dimples-small depressions that a veteran actress had practiced into their very existence-strained for an old recognition-the recognition that there had been someone innocent once , just a girl with dimples . And at the same time , Kate Riley knew this face , she knew it like a dull pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew it and hated everything about it and there could be no forgiveness , none . In redemption she was not interested , only in the moment freed of the past , all tethers neatly cut away . What would it be like ? Who could imagine such a thing ? The rarefaction , the light like the black at the center of the sun , and no memories , and without them , no one to have remembered them . No Kate . (
