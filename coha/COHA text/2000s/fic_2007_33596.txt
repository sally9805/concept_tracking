Long , golden rays raked the rolling hills surrounding Shelbyville , Kentucky , on Wednesday , August 2 . At six p.m. , the grassy parking lot of the famous fairgrounds accepted a steady stream of spectators . By seven p.m. , the lot would be overflowing and the shift to backup parking would begin . A soft breeze carried a hint of moisture from the Ohio River about twenty-five miles west , which separated the state of Kentucky from Indiana . Barn swallows swooped through the air to snare abundant insects , as crows , perched on overhead lines , watched , commenting on everything . Cattle dotted pastures . Butterflies swarmed the horse droppings at the fairgrounds . While butterflies liked flowers and flowering bushes , they also evidenced a strong fondness for manure . Each time a maintenance man dutifully picked up the manure , a cloud of yellow swallowtails , black swallowtails , milk butterflies , and small bright blue butterflies swirled up from their prize . No matter how lowly their feeding habits , it was a beautiful sight . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " Pewter bragged . " Maybe two . " " They are tempting , " Mrs. Murphy agreed with the fat gray cat . Mrs. Murphy , a sleek tiger cat , was carried by Harry Haristeen . Pewter was carted by Fair Haristeen , DVM . The cats eagerly awaited the beginning of the first night'scompetition . Shelbyville , the second glittering jewel in the Saddlebred world , attracted the best horses in the country . The show commenced a full two weeks before the Kentucky State Fair , the blowout of Saddlebred shows . The four jewels in the crown were the Lexington Junior League , Shelbyville , the Kentucky State Fair at Louisville , and the Kansas City Royal , the only big show held in late fall , November . All the others were summer shows . Throughout America , but most especially in Kentucky , Indiana , and Missouri , the Saddlebred shows added sparkle to the season and coins to the coffers . Every town bigger than a minute hosted one , no matter how humble . No one ever accused the Shelbyville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show ring oval . Most of the seating area was covered . The south of the lighted ring was anchored by an imposing two-story grandstand , where food was served if one had a ticket for the feast . The aroma of the ribs tortured Tucker , the corgi , walking between her two humans . She drooled with anticipation . " How long before we eat ? " " I do n't know , but I could faint with hunger . " Pewter sighed . " Oh la . " Mrs. Murphy thought to say more but realized if she started a fight she would unceremoniously be taken back to their suite at the Best Western hotel . Harry and Fair paused to watch horses being worked in the practice ring on the east side of the fairgrounds . Booty Pollard , a famous forty-one-year-old trainer with a fully dressed monkey perching on his shoulder , walked next to a junior riding a three-gaited country pleasure horse . The walk , trot , canter horse was one of those wonderful creatures that take care of their young rider . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth . They were leaving the ring . Booty turned his head upon hearing another trainer raise his voice . Charles " Charly " Trackwell , a big-money trainer and a peacock , shouted at a stunning young woman on an equally stunning chestnut three-gaited horse , Queen Esther . Queen Esther was much fancier than the country pleasure horse Booty 's junior was riding . Queen Esther 's trot just threw the beautiful woman up out of the saddle . Renata DeCarlo had paid two hundred fifty thousand dollars for the mare . Renata meant to win . She had to work harder than other competitors for the judges to take her seriously , but she liked hard work as much as she liked winning . At thirty-eight-although her " official " bio shaved six years off that age saying she was thirty-two-she was a movie star and there were n't many stars bred in Lincoln County , Kentucky . While everyone wanted to look at her , spectators and judges could be prejudiced . Envy from others found odd ways of expressing itself . Renata often received a ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merited being pinned first , the blue ribbon , more often than not . Shortro , her young gray stalwart three-gaited gelding , also endured lower pinnings than was fair . But Shortro , unlike Queen Esther , was happy if he won a blue , red , yellow , green , white , pink ribbon . Queen Esther always wanted the huge best-in-class ribbon , as did Renata . Horses , like people , are fully fledged personalities . " Relax your shoulders , Renata , " Charly growled . " Beautiful , " Harry commented . " Fabulous mare . " Fair prudently focused on the chestnut mare , which made Harry laugh . They passed the white barn closest to the practice ring , the silver tin roof showing some wear and tear . The old barns might need a coat of paint , unlike the grandstand , but they were airy and quite pleasant . The number of competitors was so great that tent barns had been thrown up to handle the overflow . Each day hundreds of horses competed , some being driven in , vanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses were on the grounds proved overwhelming sometimes , because not every horse was competing . Some were companion horses to keep the star horse company . The temporary stalls , bisected by two aisles , were also completely full . The great stables marked off one or even two stalls for a hospitality suite , which would be outfitted with canvas panels and drapes in the stable 's colors . Many boasted a tented ceiling inside to further enhance the welcoming atmosphere . An open bar and refreshments added to the festival atmosphere . Directors ' chairs-again in the stable colors-tack trunks , bridle cases , ribbons hanging on the " walls , " as well as lovely photographs of clients and horses completed the setting . The labor that it took to create these oases of cheer , along with another stall made into a special changing room for the riders , often behind the hospitality room , amazed Harry each time she visited one of the big Saddlebred shows , which she did once a year . Although a passionate Thoroughbred woman , she loved the Saddlebred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foxhunters . Saddlebreds could jump , really jump , which delighted Harry . The Thoroughbred , with its sloping shoulder and lower head carriage , ideally has a long , fluid stride . The Saddlebred 's energy is expended upward , high stepping with some reach , and the head is held high . Go back one hundred fifty years and the two different breeds share some common ancestors . Joan Hamilton , one of Harry 's best friends , was the driving force behind the breeding program at Kalarama Farm . Her husband , Larry Hodge , trained and also rode many of the horses . As often happens in the horse world , when the right two people find each other , a magic glow shines on everything they touch . On the way to the Kalarama ringside box , Harry and Fair strolled the midway crammed with a lot of stuff you 'd like to buy and a lot of stuff you would n't . The jewelry shop tempted Harry . She stopped to admire a ring with square-cut rubies and diamonds set in a horseshoe . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ubiquitous funnel cakes cast their special doughy scent over the area , as did hot dogs , ribs , slabs of beef , and delicious chicken turning on a spit . The food shops , jewelry shop , and clothing shops were interspersed with people from the local farm bureau and various civic organizations running the booths , all having a good time . Most of the civic booths were under the grandstand facing the midway . A gleaming SL55 Mercedes lured folks to buy raffle tickets , one hundred bucks a pop , proceeds going to charity . Flattening your wallet proved all too easy walking along this small , seductive thoroughfare . The uncovered western grandstand loomed over one side of the midway , and there were booths under it , as well . Everywhere you looked , right or left of the short midway , there was a booth . Right in front of the western grandstand , smack on the rail , were boxes , with six or eight folding chairs inside . These , rented by the great stables , were magnets for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their boxes , which unlike the rented stalls did not bear the stable colors but sported a chaste white rectangular sign with the name of the box owner in simple black Roman letters . Joan leaned forward to talk to her mother , the diminutive , lively Frances , and her father , Paul , as they checked their programs . Paul was one of those people who exerted a warm charisma , drawing people to him . Neither of the elder Hamiltons ever met a stranger . Harry stepped into the box , Mrs. Murphy in her arms . Fair , Pewter , and Tucker immediately followed . After hugs and kisses all around , everyone settled in their seats . Cookie , Joan 's brown-and-white Jack Russell , squeezed with Tucker on a seat . When Harry and Fair had arrived yesterday , they viewed Joan 's yearlings , mares , and colts , and watched Larry work the horses . Harry learned from watching Larry , who knew exactly when to stop the lesson . So many trainers overtrained , the result being the horse grew sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overtraining proved a costly mistake . Frances , wearing a peach linen and silk dress with a corsage , turned to her daughter and said , " Joan , did you show the newlyweds Harlem 's Dreamgirl ? " " Yes , I did . " Paul , a twinkle in his eye , twisted in his seat to wink at Fair . " You got the dreamgirl . " Fair slapped the older but still powerfully built World War II Navy vet on the shoulder . " I think we both married our dreamgirls . " " Paul and I married in the Dark Ages . " Frances laughed . " Still a honeymoon , " Paul gallantly said . Joan took off her beige silk jacket as the heat bore down . A gorgeous pin , a ruby and sapphire riding crop intertwined through a sparkling horseshoe , graced the left lapel . " Joan , did you fix the clasp on that pin ? " Frances asked . " Yes , I did , and it 's tight as a tick . " " Good . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's jewelry . " Joan , knowing her mother would n't be satisfied until she had examined the pin , slipped her coat off the chair , handing it to her mother . Turning the lapel back , Frances fingered the pin . " Well , that should hold it . " Before handing it back to Joan , she noted the careful work the jeweler had performed . " You know that 's our lucky pin . You wear it when it counts , but always on the last night of the show . " Everyone studied their programs . " Third class has that movie star in it . " Paul read down the list . The third class was the adult three-gaited show pleasure . " She 's going to have a tough time beating Melinda Falwell . " Joan folded back her program . " Booty 's client . " Paul named Melinda 's trainer , a gregarious man still recovering from a sulfurous divorce last year . The recovery was financial as well as emotional . It was Booty who Harry and Fair had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intense rivalry set off fireworks in the Saddlebred world as the old guard began to retire or die off , leaving the younger men and a few women in their middle years to come forward in a big way . Larry Hodge , Booty Pollard , and Charly Trackwell had taken up where Tom Moore , Earl Teater , and the late Bradshaw brothers had left off . Pushing behind Larry , Booty , and Charly were men and more women than in previous generations , in their late twenties and early thirties , one of whom , Ward Findley , evidenced special talent . Saddlebred trainers rode the difficult horses or the horses in the big classes , which would add thousands of dollars to the horse 's worth if the animal showed well . In the Thoroughbred world , trainers did not ride in the races . Here they did , which gave the shows an extra dimension . It was as if Bill Parcells played quarterback or Earl Weaver stepped up to the plate . The amateur riders , coached by the trainers , did n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractable and less was at stake . A win at one of the big shows could send a horse 's value skyrocketing . Few people are immune to that incentive , hence the enduring appeal of the trainer/rider . Ward Findley , who was twenty-nine and had close-cropped , jet-black hair and sparkling blue eyes , quickly came up to the Kalarama box , leaned over , and whispered to Joan , " You 'd better get to the barn . " Right behind Ward came Booty Pollard , his pet monkey on his shoulder . " Trouble , " Ward continued . The monkey , Miss Nasty , chattered as she peered at everyone in the box . Miss Nasty loved Booty , but she hated his snake collection , which he kept at home . She , at least , got to travel . Fortunately , the snakes did not . Booty did have peculiar tastes in pets . Paul , overhearing , stood up . " Daddy , you stay here . People need to see you and Mom . " Joan was already out of the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalarama had their regular vet , but he did n't attend the shows . The organizers kept a vet on the premises so there was no need for each competitor or breeder to tie up their own vet for the four evenings of the show . Not to be left behind , Harry scooped up both cats , her progress slowed by the two unhappy kitties squirming in her arms . " If you 'd put me down , I could follow just fine , " Mrs. Murphy complained . " She thinks you 'll run off , " Tucker , excited by the tension in the humans , commented . " You 're a big , fat help , " Mrs. Murphy growled . " I 'm a dog . I 'm obedient . You 're a cat . You 're not . " Tucker relished the discomfort of her two friends , since they often lorded over her . The conversation abruptly ended as they reached Barn Five , where three horses were being led into the barn , Charly Trackwell trotting after them , his face grim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the chestnut mare from the practice ring ? " Pewter studied the gleaming animal , her long neck graceful . " Yes . " Mrs. Murphy was happy when Harry unhitched Pewter 's and her leash and quickly deposited them in the hospitality room . Pewter used the opportunity to jump onto the table , snatching a succulent square of ham . " You 're a goddamned diva ! " Charly shouted at Renata DeCarlo , who stormed ahead of Charly . The loss of board and training fees for three horses would hurt Charly a bit , but the real blow was losing his movie-star client . Joan prudently stood by a stall , since Charly now faced Larry , Renata to Larry 's side . Fair stood behind Larry . " I 'm sick of you shouting at me , Charly . " Renata , face flushed , was remarkably calm . Charly turned to Larry . " You 're behind this , Hodge . You 've been trying to steal Renata away from me since she came to my barn . " " That 's not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the glamour . And you 'll make a bloody fortune . You always do . " Charly , shaking with rage , stepped toward Larry . Renata grabbed Charly 's arm , which he threw off . " You 've criticized me one time too many . You 're an egotistical shit and I 'm sick of it . " Much as he wanted to hit her and Larry , too , Charly managed to control himself . He stopped breathing for a second , then gulped air . " Renata , you redefine the word ' ego . ' " " We can all sort this out tomorrow when everybody has calmed down , " Larry sensibly suggested . " The hell with you . " Then Charly wheeled on Renata and pointed his finger right in her face . " I know about you . " With that he turned on his booted heel and left .
