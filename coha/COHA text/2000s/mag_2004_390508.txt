Section : HISTORY HAPPENED HERE HOW GRAND RAPIDS REGAINED ITS GRANDEUR <p> I 'VE LONG HELD THE NOTION that my lion-pawed oak dining table was a prime example of Grand Rapids furniture . Michigan 's second city is the birthplace of mass-produced furniture in America , but when I visited last summer , I did n't see anything that resembled it . And I discovered a lot more to think about than tables and chairs . Except for Steelcase , the office furnishings conglomerate founded here in 1912 , most of the business had decades ago moved to the American South , with its cheaper labor costs . The once-flourishing automobile-parts industry had similarly declined . Yet I found the place still humming with the kind of energy and optimism that had attended its birth . <p> In 1838 Henry Schoolcraft , a Commissioner of Indian Affairs , visited the tiny settlement on the Grand River at virtually the hour of its founding and predicted that " its rise to wealth and populousness must be a mere question of time , and that time hurried on by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cabinetmaker , William Haldane , had already opened shop . As the region 's thriving fur trade began to diminish , new arrivals looked to carve their opportunities from the great untouched forests of the upper Midwest . They floated logs down the Grand River , and with the falls that gave the town its name they found the power for their mills . The oldest dated piece of Grand Rapids furniture , on view at the city 's marvelous history museum , is a drum-style sewing table with a message written inside the frame : The maker , Bernard Orth , " fixed this table for present of my wife and she is a good wife , 25 Jan 1859 . " <p> Grand Rapids today is a big small town , with a population of about 650,000 that includes the surrounding suburbs . The core is compact , set along the river and served by five bridges that appear especially handsome when illuminated after dark . There is a very pleasant river walk , installed in 1993 , and as the former mayor John Logic proudly points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish for salmon in the very heart of downtown . Some handsome remnants - warehouses , showrooms , and such - of the glory days of " Furniture City , " as it was called , still hug the water , but the Grand Rapids skyline also holds a surprising number of tall buildings of recent vintage . <p> Many cities mourn a great loss that served to galvanize their preservation movements . In New York that loss was Pennsylvania Station . For Grand Rapids it was City Hall . Built in 1888 , the burly , imposing stone building was demolished in 1969 . When a young woman named Mary Stiles , one of its fiercest defenders , chained herself to the wrecking ball , her photograph ran in newspapers around the country . Today relics of City Hall , including the great clock - its four dials eight feet tall - can be seen at the Public Museum of Grand Rapids . <p> Occupying a modern building that fronts the river on the site of an old flour mill , the museum goes back a surprisingly long way ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the smartest and most engaging history museums I have visited anywhere , and two of its exhibits particularly captured my imagination . <p> One , " The Streets of Old Grand Rapids , " is a full-size , two-story re-creation of the city center around the turn of the last century . Storefronts of businesses that flourished at the time are furnished in meticulous detail . Sounds of people talking , train whistles , walls cluttered with handbills all work together to provide such a persuasive trip to another time that I was surprised , even annoyed , when after a few blocks the display ended and I was back in the present . <p> However , " Furniture City " lay ahead . The exhibit , sponsored in large part by the Steelcase Corporation and brilliantly conceived by a designer seasoned at the Smithsonian , manages through the prosaic medium of bedposts and bureaus to convey all the tumult of a great human enterprise . The journey through nearly 11,000 feet of gallery space begins around 1840 , guided by Johannes Meerman , a fictional character who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded commentary . He shows up throughout the exhibit . Here he is a Dutch immigrant ( one of the groups that settled this region ) , who has just begun to work for the Berkey Brothers mill . <p> At the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia , displays by three local manufacturers won medals , beating out established East Coast firms . Berkey &; Gay 's award-winning matching dresser and washstand , made of walnut , are on display and far more elaborate than anything I had ever associated with Grand Rapids . <p> Johannes appears again around 1900 , this time as a band sawyer - a skilled mechanic . In this section details of his work and life are drawn from a letter a Dutch-born worker sent home to his parents . By the time I came to a recreated interior of a 1910 factory , showing various stages of the business from the rough mill room to the upholstery and shipping divisions , it was clear that Grand Rapids stood at its zenith . But the museum does n't just dwell on the glories of enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1911 , when more than 4,000 workers went out on strike , told through newspaper accounts , letters , and the speeches of the embattled participants . <p> Another look at the class structure of the era comes through a set of 10 factory-worker trading cards , free to museum-goers , which draw on the historical record to describe various jobs . On one side is a cartoon portrait of a worker ; on the reverse his or her story . " My name is John Mancewicz and I am 14 years old . I just started working as a lugger in the furniture factory . I wanted to quit school and start working here a lot sooner , but all these laws were passed that made me stay in school until now . " The lugger makes 18 cents an hour . George Randall , who handles the ripsaw , gets 40 cents , while Clara Loomis , a clerk , is paid $10 a week , " less than the men I work with , but that is expected . I do n't have a family to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via some wonderful old photos and an entertaining narration that introduces the wholesale Furniture Market , a twice-yearly event that lasted until the 1960s . At its peak it was an effervescent three-week-long party and that excitement is conveyed through a perfectly imagined chat between two characters , a salesman and a store owner , that could have come straight from the pen of Sinclair Lewis . " The market is the tonic for whatever ails , " says the salesman , and his companion agrees : " You go home all filled up with ginger , " I felt a pang to see the streets of the town not yet sundered by urban renewal , but I left that part of the exhibit full of ginger . <p> Moving on to modern times , I found Johannes again , this time as a systems installer of Steelcase workstations . Steelcase has confronted some hard times lately , since offices are n't exactly expanding these days , but its largess and that of its retired director Peter Wege manifest themselves in many ways , including an exquisite restoration of a Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Wege 's foundation for a new addition to the city 's art museum . <p> Even on the briefest visit to Grand Rapids certain names become familiar . For instance , the Public Museum is part of the Van Andel Museum Center , and the nearly million-square-foot DeVos Place currently rising along the river will be one of the Midwest 's largest convention centers . Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos , whose Dutch-born forebears settled here at the turn of the twentieth century , founded the Amway Corporation in 1959 . It achieved fame as either a masterpiece of direct selling or a highly lucrative pyramid scheme , depending on who tells it . In recent years the company has reconstituted itself as Alticor and sells household goods and other products worldwide . <p> The hotel I stayed in , the Amway Grand Plaza , is divided in two . There are a soaringly modern tower , with great river views , and a magnificently restored historic section , built in 1913 and still called the Pantlind . The older wing has a spacious lobby and public rooms aglow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very appreciative patrons . There were weddings by the bushel the June weekend I was there , and I heard one departing hotel guest exult , " Is n't it wonderful there 's something like this in Grand Rapids ! " <p> Frederik Meijer , whose grocery and discount stores blanket the Midwest , is another local benefactor . In 1995 he and his wife , Lena , founded a sculpture park and botanical garden , reflecting their respective passions . A 10-minute drive from downtown Grand Rapids , the 125-acre facility is home to works by some of the world 's great sculptors , from Auguste Rodin to Richard Hunt . Last summer Louise Bourgeois 's bronze and marble spider brooded on 30-foot legs over the hills and flowery meadows of the carefully uncultivated landscape . The Meijers , now in their eighties , clearly revel in the amazing and ever-growing treasure they have brought forth . When I attended a concert at the brand-new amphitheater , Frederik Meijer strode briskly to the podium and with great aplomb led the musicians in a rendition of " Stars and Stripes Forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Rapids started to appreciate modern sculpture in the late 1960s , when Alexander Calder , perhaps an unlikely patron , was persuaded to create a 43-foot-tall stabile . Titled La Grande Vitesse , the piece expresses the power of the swiftly flowing river . Almost immediately the flame-colored steel sculpture became the heart and soul of the city . Nancy Mulnix , in 1967 a young mother of three and a volunteer at the local art museum , was the catalyst . <p> " We invited the art critic Henry Geldzahler to speak at the museum , " she told me . " We were in the midst of urban renewal , and when I showed him the holes in the ground where the new city hall and county administrative buildings were going , he mentioned the brand-new National Endowment for the Arts , saying , ' This is the perfect place for the NEA 's first grant for public sculpture . ' <p> " I began to correspond with Calder ; he was somebody who had always touched my heart . And he agreed to do it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up with a matching grant of $45,000 , but in the end it came to $127,000 , and Calder helped us out . He asked me to pick out some gouaches , and he let us auction them to raise the money . Then the purchasers donated them to the art museum . " <p> Calder completed the piece in two years , and for the 1969 dedication Aaron Copland wrote a fanfare . In its early days La Grande Vitesse attracted a surprising degree of local ire . Nancy Mulnix recalls hate mail , including a letter saying , " If I ever see you , I 'll spit on you . " Then there was the bullet shot into her home . Things are different today . The stabile 's image appears on street signs , police cars , and garbage trucks . And every June Calder 's immense emblem is celebrated anew , with a hugely popular three-day festival , drawing as many as 500,000 visitors . " It is the gathering place for causes , for protests , for celebrations , " Nancy Mulnix has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start and finish at the Calder . It is never alone , and it is never defaced . " <p> GRAND RAPIDS HAS ONE OF THE SMARTEST AND MOST ENGAGING HISTORY MUSEUMS I HAVE VISITED ANYWHERE . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Calder 's monumental stabile is meant to evoke the power of the Grand River . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Left : A spider by Louise Bourgeois looms over the sculpture park .
