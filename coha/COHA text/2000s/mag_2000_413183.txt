Unsanitized by censors , uncompromising in their truth , scenes of death and destruction filmed at the village of San Pietro Infine in December 1943 brought viewers face to face with the reality of war . The message was clear . The Italian campaign was a bloody affair , with a staggering cost in lives and materiel . The messenger was Hollywood director John Huston , then a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps . Huston , who had started as a screenwriter in 1938 and made his directorial debut with the 1941 classic The Maltese Falcon , joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps as a lieutenant in April 1942 . His career in motion pictures was to span nearly five decades before his death in 1987 . He made three documentaries while in the service , the most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , the purpose behind the documentary was to give new soldiers a glimpse of what combat was like , to offer an explanation of why the campaign in Italy was proceeding more slowly than anticipated , or to reassure the American public that its soldiers were being judiciously employed by competent commanders . Regardless of the original intent , which was probably a combination of all three , Huston and his camera crew of six produced a startling anti-war film . Years later , he wrote , " A number of high  --  ranking Army officers , including a three-star general , were present at the first showing of The Battle of San Pietro . About three quarters of the way through the picture the general got up and left the projection room . It was naturally assumed that he was displeased with what he saw , and it was incumbent upon the rest to show their displeasure also . But , of course , they had to do so by rank , according to protocol . It would n't do for a lieutenant colonel to go stalking out before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute later by the next-ranking officer , and then one by one they filed out , with the low man on the totem pole bringing up the rear . I shook my head and thought , What a bunch of assholes ! There goes San Pietro . " ' While it may have been unsettling for a group of Stateside Army officers to view graphic combat footage , the soldiers of the U.S. Army 's 36th Division had actually lived and died on camera . The 36th was a National Guard division composed primarily of Texans . It traced its lineage back to the days of the Republic of Texas in the 1830s . Its three regiments , the 141st , 142nd and 143rd , added a chapter to the honored history of the 36th Division at San Pietro . An old saying goes that all roads lead to Rome , but in December 1943 , Lt. Gen. Mark Clark and the U.S. Fifth Army were concerned with only one , Highway 6 , which ran through the mountainous country of southern Italy past San Pietro , into the valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distance from San Pietro to Rome was roughly 115 miles , and every defensible hill and valley of it would be bitterly contested by troops of the German Tenth Army , under the command of Generaloberst Heinrich-Gottfried von Vietinghoff-Scheel . American units were already drawn up around San Pietro when the Fifth Army undertook its mission on December 1 , in a combined offensive with the British to capture Rome . The Americans were to drive through the Mignano Gap , cross the Rapido River and capture Frosinone , a town 50 miles south of Rome . With Frosinone in American hands , an amphibious landing was to be made by two divisions 35 miles south of the capital at Anzio . The British were expected to be in position to menace Rome from the east , and the two American forces could link up quickly . In this coordinated stroke , the Allies would liberate the Eternal City and possibly cut off the escape route of thousands of German soldiers . The window of opportunity , however , was closing for the Americans and the British . The date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available landing craft would have to be released by the end of January 1944 . If the Allies could not maintain their timetable , there would be no available transport for the amphibious portion of the Italian offensive . Compounding matters , the terrain was inhospitable at best , and Field Marshal Albert Kesselring , commander of all German forces in the Mediterranean , was in the midst of conducting one of the most brilliant defensive campaigns in military history . Kesselring had coordinated a fighting withdrawal up the Italian boot , using the terrain to his best advantage and settling into a series of strong defensive lines that obliged the Allies to pay a heavy price for gains measured in yards . With a victory at San Pietro and the capture of the village of San Vittore to the west , American forces could press on to Cassino and assault Kesselring 's formidable Gustav Line . The British 56th Division and the 1st Special Service Force , composed of specially trained American and Canadian troops , captured Monte Camino and Monte la Difensa , while the 142nd Infantry occupied Monte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gap was secure . Fighting occurred when and where the Germans chose to stand . Each succeeding mountain , ridgeline or village was a potential meatgrinder . So it was that the Texans of the 36th Division found themselves before the high ground of Monte Lungo , which guarded both the railroad line to Rome and Highway 6 . To the northeast stood Monte Sammucro , nearly 4,000 feet high . Just as Monte Sammucro 's grade began to sharpen appreciably , the village of San Pietro came into view , dominating Highway 6 and the steep valley below . Because they had captured both Monte Maggiore and nearby Monte Rotondo , American commanders expected little resistance in the San Pietro area . The Germans , they believed , might already be pulling back to avoid being cut off by a swift American advance . At first , the Germans actually had intended to withdraw from the area and cross the rain-swollen Rapido and Garigliano rivers . But Adolf Hitler intervened , directing that San Pietro be held as long as possible . The 2nd Battalion , 15th Panzergrenadier Regiment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper , while two other battalions , the 3/15th and 2/71st Panzergrenadiers , were positioned on Monte Lungo and Monte Sammucro . Even without a well-entrenched enemy force firing from its stone buildings , San Pietro was something of a fortress . " Expecting Monte Lungo to come into Allied possession easily , Allied commanders looked toward San Pietro , " wrote historian Martin Blumenson . " What had escaped their intelligence officers was how inaccessible San Pietro really was . There were simply no good approaches to the village , where houses provided stout stone walls for weapons emplacement . Separated from Monte Rotondo and the Cannavinelle Hill by a deep gully and sitting above the Ceppagna road , San Pietro could be entered only by way of cart tracks and trails across the ravine-scarred face of Monte Sammucro . Nor was it evident to Allied intelligence how important San Pietro was for the observation it gave of Monte Lungo and the trough that carried Highway 6 to Cassino.

Photograph American shells pound San Pietro , ravaging the village but contributing little to the task of dislodging the hardened troops of the 2nd Battalion , 15th Panzergrenadier Regiment , who defended it . // Major General Geoffrey Keyes , commander of the U.S. II Corps , and Maj. Gen. Fred L. Walker , commander of the 36th Division , planned the effort to capture San Pietro . Keyes directed the Italian Ist Motorized Group to take Monte Lungo , reasoning that a triumph in its first engagement on the Allied side would strengthen the unit 's morale . Two battalions of the 143rd Infantry were to capture the summit of Monte Sammucro while also driving around it , taking San Pietro and continuing on toward San Vittore . The Italians headed up Monte Lungo on the morning of December 8 , marching in close order with two battalions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd Battalion of the 15th Panzergrenadier Regiment . By midday , it was obvious that the Italian advance was doomed . Of the 1,600 attackers , 84 were killed , 122 wounded and 170 missing when the disorganized 1 st Motorized Group headed back down the mountain . The 1st Battalion of the 143rd Infantry ( 1/143 ) over  --  ran the Germans on top of Monte Sammucro just as dawn was tinting the eastern sky . Later reinforced by the 504th Parachute Infantry , the Americans dug in and held their ground against counterattacks by the 2/71 st Panzergrenadiers for several days . U.S. soldiers also occupied high ground on nearby Hill 1205 , while the 3rd Ranger Battalion captured Hill 950 and fought a seesaw battle with the Germans , first being pushed off and then retaking the hill on December 9 . The 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 143rd managed to advance only 400 yards toward San Pietro before concentrated fire from the 2/15th Panzergrenadiers halted them . The bitter fighting left the 1st Battalion at only half strength , around 340 men , by December 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during three days of intense fighting , December 15-17 . Walker realized that if he could take three small hills roughly a mile west of Hill 1205 , he could flank San Pietro and threaten the avenue of withdrawal for the 3/15th Panzergrenadiers still occupying Monte Lungo . The 1st Battalion , 143rd Infantry , and the 504th Parachute Infantry would seize those hills by dawn on the 15th . The main frontal assault against San Pietro would then be carried out by armor of the 753rd Tank Battalion , striking from the east , and the 141st Infantry , advancing north from positions on Monte Rotondo . While the defenders of San Pietro were engaged and unable to fire in support of their comrades on Monte Lungo , Walker would send elements of the 142nd and 143rd regiments against Monte Lungo from the west . Employing armor had first been seriously considered at the division level after a visit to Walker 's headquarters by Brig . Gen. Donald W Brann , the Fifth Army operations officer , who brought word that General Clark was interested in making greater use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker 's attached tank battalion could help capture San Pietro . Walker did not think the ground was favorable for tank warfare . Since both Clark and Keyes wanted to employ armor , however , Walker said he would try . Any tanks approaching San Pietro would be forced to take a narrow road , barely wide enough for two-way traffic . Several trails intersected the road , but these were painfully narrow-the widest was scarcely 8 feet . The road itself was made even more hazardous by four choke points-a 10-foot culvert , a 15-foot culvert and two bridges . American vehicles passing through the choke points would be particularly vulnerable to German fire . The slopes of Monte Sammucro were terraced , with retaining walls as high as 7 feet between them . There simply was no room for armor to maneuver , but combat engineers devised a plan that was put in motion on December 11 . The engineers broke down the walls of a number of the terraces and carved a path for the tanks to descend once they got high enough into the hills to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead tank moved out , but it was unable to gain traction on ground that had been soaked by rain . When it threw a track , the assault was abandoned . Accurate German artillery fire had made the decision easy . On December 15 , the 1/43rd and the 504th Parachute made several unsuccessful attempts to take the three key hills identified by Walker . Nevertheless , 16 M4 Sherman tanks of Company A , 753rd Tank Battalion , a company of supporting infantry and a borrowed British Valentine tank equipped with a prefabricated bridge headed down the road at midmorning . While the plan originally called for the tanks to be positioned to attack San Pietro from two different directions , the lead tank soon found the road blocked and was ordered to change direction across the terraces . That tank succeeded in destroying several machine-gun nests and a German command post . As German artillery belatedly cranked up , the next three Shermans found their trail blocked by a destroyed German Mark IV tank . With the terraces too steep for a maneuver such as the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the road and fire into the town in support of the coming infantry attack . About 1,000 yards from San Pietro , the first of the trio reached a bridge , crossed and was promptly blown apart by a German anti-tank shell . The second Sherman crossed the bridge and took two hits before exploding . The third was destroyed by three German shells before it even reached the bridge . The next three Shermans in line each struck mines and were disabled . One tank fell 5 feet off the edge of the road and flipped over . Three more lost tracks and were immobilized . Still another tank tried to take the terrace route that the lead tank had negotiated earlier , but turned over on its side . A Sherman crashed into another that was already disabled . The Valentine was undamaged , but it was hemmed in by crippled Shermans and had to be abandoned . Of the 16 Shermans that began the armored foray , only four returned . Five of the 12 abandoned tanks were later recovered and repaired . Photograph Top : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest facility through the ruins of San Pietro . Above : By the time it secured San Pietro on December 17 , the 36th Division had suffered 1,100 casualties . On Christmas Day , five more soldiers died fighting in the nearby hills . // Lieutenant John Huston watched the armored fiasco , and though his version was somewhat at odds with the official one , his observations are notable . " This was a most ill-conceived plan , undoubtedly conceived by someone back of the lines who did n't know the first damned thing about the terrain around the village , " he wrote . " The right side of the road was a mountainside , and the other side was a drop-off down the mountain . Once committed , the tanks could n't turn around .... We could see the tanks burning and exploding , and men running and trying to hide . After it was over , we crept forward and photographed the disastrous results . It was n't pretty . There was a boot here-with the foot and part of a leg still in it-a burned torso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed the tank attack . " I was watching them from what seemed to be about a mile away , " he recalled . " I saw the tanks go up that road . They were moving slowly because of the curves , and they were hitting mines . When they got to where the German 88s could knock them out , the tank behind would push aside one that was hit and just keep on going . The tankers were a bunch of brave people . That 's for sure . " It was Wells " outfit that , according to the official history , the tanks were to support in the main effort to take San Pietro . Lieutenant Colonel Milton Landry had commanded the 2/141st during the San Pietro operation . He remembered his unit 's mission as an effort to cut any resupply of German troops or equipment from the west . The 2nd Battalion 's frontal assault stepped off at noon . " We had companies E , FI G , H and the battalion Headquarters Company , " said Landry during a recent interview . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Captain Charles Beacham was shot through the cheek , and Ray Wells pulled him out of the line of fire . Captain Hammer was killed , and Captain John Chapin was also wounded . I remember the fact that we had men falling left and right all the way through . We attacked all afternoon and up into the night . We had lost so many men that Company L was sent to join us . When we were finally ordered to pull back , there were 42 of us left in the battalion plus the extra rifle company . I would say we had close to 800 men when we started . " Landry received the Distinguished Service Cross for his role in the action of December 15-17 . He led from the front and was wounded three times . " The terrain facing San Pietro was terraced almost the complete distance from Monte Rotondo to the town itself , and most of the terraces had a wire fence on top and near the edge , " he related . " In almost every case the enemy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure a way to eliminate this hazard , and we came up with an almost foolproof plan . Two of the larger men would lift me up so I could take hold of the tripwire , and when I gave the signal they would drop me so that I could pull the wire down with me , explode the booby trap and at the same time be protected by the rock wall which bordered the terrace . " The German defenders were so deeply . entrenched that many times American troops were forced to get right on top of them to eliminate strongpoints . " You could n't see them , " Landry continued . " You had to go up and across one terrace , and then there was always another one . You could look in at the wall and see what you thought was a black rock , but it was n't a rock . It was a hole with a machine gun on the other side where the Germans had dug a big pit and connecting trenches where they could crawl back and forth . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt and plants . They could sit in there with wine , black bread and cheese that comes out of a tube like toothpaste and wait for us .

Above : A local woman kisses the hand of a soldier of the 143rd Infantry as San Pietro 's populace welcomes their American liberators on December 17 . Huston and his camera crew were attached to the 143rd when he filmed his documentary of the battle . // The maps furnished by the military listed most of the German bunkers as anti-aircraft positions , but the soldiers of the 36th Division found that was not true . Most of Landry 's maps were highway maps that had been bought by his surgeon in North Africa . " The highway maps were just as good as our government maps , " he said . " The scale on them was terribly small , though . You could make a line on the map with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take about 200 or 300 yards . On the map , that distance was only as thick as the width of the pencil lead . We would get copies of Life magazine , and they would show us not having moved at all . We would fight for two or three weeks up and down mountains , and on the maps it looked like we had n't advanced . " Ironically , while Landry was seeking cover from German fire at San Pietro , he accidentally discovered a brass plate driven into stone by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey . " I was laying my head on the plate , and it meant that there were good maps of the entire area . We could n't get them because nobody knew we had them . " " Most of the men in my squad were wounded right away , " Wells recalled . " The Germans were looking right down our throats all the time , and the snipers were pretty accurate . A lot of the people I saw were shot right between the eyes . Our medics had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them shot by bullets that went right through the middle of that cross . " In the thick of the fighting , Wells placed suppressing fire on the buildings where the harassing snipers were holed up . " The enemy was in the houses upstairs , shooting out the windows at us , " explained Landry . " Raymond Wells was leading a heavy machine gun squad , and I think he was the only one that had a machine gun left . Originally the crew had a big water-cooled machine gun . He abandoned that and picked up a one-man light machine gun . Later , after we had done our job , he acted as a rear guard for our withdrawal back to Monte Rotondo . " Wells probably accounted for three German snipers during the action , and he no doubt saved a number of his comrades in the process . He is n't really sure of the effects of his fire . " You just go on to the next one and do your best , but I never felt like going over and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions at San Pietro , Wells received the Silver Star . While the 2/141st had its hands full , the 3/143rd and the 2/142nd had crossed Highway 6 and edged around Monte Lungo . By the time the frontal assault against San Pietro was underway , the Americans were on top of Monte Lungo , fighting the Reconnaissance Battalion of the 29th Panzer  --  grenadier Division . On the morning of the 16th , most of the high ground was under Allied control . The Italians took the last portion of the ridgeline that day . The capture of Monte Lungo unhinged the German position in San Pietro . With U.S. troops on top of Monte Sammucro and Monte Lungo , the evacuation route along Highway 6 was imperiled . The Germans saw that there was nothing more to gain and everything to lose by remaining in San Pietro any longer .

" Some of the things they said were quite eloquent : they were fighting for what their future might hold for them , their country and the world . Later you saw these same men dead . Before placing the bodies in coffins for burial , the procedure was to lay them in a row in their bedrolls , make positive identification-where possible-then cover them . At that point , it was necessary to lift the body up , and I had my cameras so placed that the faces of the dead came right to the lens . In the uncut version I had their living voices speaking over their dead faces about their hopes for the future . " The Army demanded that The Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily edited , but even after being cut , it was rarely shown until after the war . While some officials initially distanced themselves from The Battle of San Pietro , Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall viewed the film and stated : " This picture should be seen by every American soldier in training . It will not discourage but rather will prepare them for the initial shock of combat . " Instead of being shunned , Huston was promoted to major and decorated . Author Midge Mackenzie interviewed Huston twice during the 1980s and later wrote for The New York Times : " The Battle of San Pietro stands alone in the history of documentary filmmaking . Presenting the battle in the Liri Valley as a costly continuing campaign rather than in retrospect as a strategic victory , it is the only complete record of an infantry battle .

My battalion was used to attacking at night . For us to attack in daylight across a valley and up a hill where the Germans had been fortified for a long time was suicidal . I was fortunate to have a battalion that stuck with me and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't many of them left , but the ones that were left were doing their job . " The cost was high at San Pietro , but much bitter fighting was still to come . Ahead of the 36th Division lay the controversial attempts to cross the Rapido along the Gustav Line in January 1944 . The amphibious landing at Anzio did take place on January 20 , but Maj. Gen. John P Lucas ' decision to consolidate his perimeter defenses instead of immediately advancing inland gave Kesserling time to counterattack and contain the beachhead until May 23 . Rome did not fall until June 4 , two days before the landings in Normandy . The town of San Pietro was eventually rebuilt some distance away from its original location . The demolished buildings were left where they stood . They are still visible today , a mute memorial to the struggle that took place .
