A lot of people want to serve God , but only in an advisory capacity .  --  Mrs. Miracle " I told you not to swear , you little shit . " Seth Webster grabbed his sons by the scruffs of their necks in order to keep his squirming twins apart . It demanded all his strength to keep the two , fists flying , from attacking each other . " Mr. Webster ! " Mrs. Hampston , his housekeeper , the third in as many months , stood with her hands braced against her hips , her mouth thinned with disapproval . " That 's hardly the example to be giving your children . " Truth be known , Seth could n't have agreed with her more , but there was a limit to just how much one man could take . The minute he 'd walked into the house , he 'd discovered his six-year-old twins rolling around the bedroom floor , intent on murdering one another . The woman was no help .

Judd retaliated , his tongue resembling that of a Gila monster . " Judd . Jason . Stop that this instant . " Both children squirmed . The fight went out of Judd first , and his shoulders slumped forward . " I 'm sorry , Daddy . " His son scuffed the toe of his Nike against the bedroom carpet , his gaze lowered to the floor . The love Seth felt for his children tightened a band around his heart . " I was wrong , too , " he admitted , affectionately mussing the boy 's brownish red hair . The last few months had been a trial for all three of them . His in-laws had raised the twins for the past four years following Pamela 's death .

Having the two move in with Sharon and Jerry had seemed the perfect solution . His own parents traveled extensively and were unable to help . With time and effort the twins had adjusted to life without their mother  --  something Seth had yet to manage . " I need to talk to you privately following dinner , " Mrs. Hampston announced stiffly as she walked past him on her way back into the kitchen . " She 's gon na quit , " Jason announced as soon as the housekeeper was out of sight . " The same way Mrs. Cooper quit , " Judd added . " And Mrs. Larson . " And everyone else , Seth added silently . He felt as if the entire world had quit on him . It 'd all started when Sharon had phoned last July and abruptly announced it was time the twins moved back with him .

With Judd and Jason due to start first grade in the fall , the time for transition was now . In the months since , Seth wondered if he was ever meant to be a father . He appreciated his in-laws ' help . They 'd done more for him and the twins than he 'd ever be able to repay . But Jerry had recently retired , and the two had already sacrificed four years of their lives . Their help had gotten Seth through the worst of the child-rearing years , or so he believed . He 'd taken a crash course in this parenting business and discovered it was n't nearly as easy as it sounded . It shocked Seth how short his patience could be . Within five minutes of promising himself to set a good example , he 'd referred to his own son as a little shit . Unfortunately the term fit Judd to a tee .

It had been much easier to consider himself a decent father when he was separated by a thousand miles . He called often , mailed the kids letters , and spent as much time with them as his schedule would allow . The lessons had come swiftly and sharply that summer when Judd and Jason had moved back in with him . The quick succession of live-in housekeepers was testimony to exactly how much of a failure he 'd been . " Are you gon na wash my mouth out with soap ? " Judd asked , making a face as though he could already taste the unpleasantness . Seth sat down on the edge of the bottom bunk bed and weighed the decision . " He ca n't , " Jason assured his twin , flopping down on the mattress beside him . " Dad said the S word . " " Is the F word worse than the S word ?

" " It do n't matter ' cause she 's gon na quit anyway . " This bit of wisdom came from Jason . The kid was probably right , too . Sitting back against the wall , Seth draped an arm around each of his children 's shoulders and released a jagged sigh . " What are we going to do now ? " Judd asked . " We need a housekeeper , " Jason added . His son turned dark , round eyes to Seth , looking for him to supply the answers . " Hey , she has n't quit yet . " Seth tried to sound optimistic but doubted that he convinced anyone . They 'd seen it all too often before not to recognize the symptoms . The housekeeper wanted out . " We tried to be good .
