<p> The irony of Mike Modano 's rise to the cusp of the record for U.S.-born NHL scorers is that the Dallas Stars center 's journey began on the Canadian plains . <p> In 1986 , when Modano was 16 , he left his Westland , Mich. , home to play in Saskatchewan for the Prince Albert Raiders in the Western Hockey League . The Canadian major junior league is known for producing as many NHL tough guys as scoring sensations . <p> " It 's freezing cold in Prince Albert . When you go there you are going there for hockey , " says Detroit Red Wings general manager Ken Holland , then an NHL scout . " He was going to a small town in Saskatchewan and to a league known for long bus rides and lots of physical play . That 's the commitment he had to play hockey . " <p> Modano says he also endured " razzing , " some good-natured , some not , as an American playing in a league that then was exclusively Canadian . " When I got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " That was the motivation to do well . I was in Canada where they love their sport . They expect nothing less than your best . I felt like I had to make an impact . " <p> Two decades later , Modano is still making an impact , seven points shy of passing Phil Housley ( 1,232 points ) to become the leading U.S.-born scorer . Modano has the goals record ( 507 ) , passing Joe Mullen ( 502 ) last season . " I thought Jeremy Roenick had a chance , but with ( Modano 's ) skills and longevity it was just a matter of time , " Housley says . <p> Roenick ( 1,170 points ) and Modano are both 37 . But Roenick 's numbers have dropped off the past two seasons  --  50 points in 128 games  --  while Modano is still one of the most dangerous offensive players . <p> " Nobody can do more with the puck at higher speeds than Mike Modano can even today , " Stars President Jim Lites says . <p> At 6-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed in a blink of an eye . When he takes a pass in stride in the neutral zone , fans start to lift out of their seats in anticipation . <p> " He just needs a half-step , and he 's gone , " Lites says . <p> Certainly USA Hockey officials could n't be happier that Modano is about to be a recordholder . <p> " He epitomizes everything good in USA Hockey and in the sport , " says Jim Johannson , assistant executive director of USA Hockey . " He still comes off as an unassuming kid from Michigan . His stardom has n't consumed him . ... I just find him fun to watch as the jersey flows off of him as he skates up ice . " <p> Appreciates his coaches <p> When he entered the NHL for the Minnesota North Stars in 1989 , Modano was quiet and reserved , not the outgoing conversationalist he is today . " I was painfully shy , " he says . <p> He laughs when he thinks of the conversations he and then-Dallas coach Bob Gainey would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete player . " Bob thought more than he spoke , " Modano says , a grin emerging . " He was as quiet as I was , and we would sit there and stare at each other to see who would say something first . " <p> Gainey , now Montreal 's general manager , and Modano butted heads about Modano 's lack of defensive prowess early in his career . Modano now says Gainey was " the best teacher I 've ever had . " <p> Ex-Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock was also good for his career , Modano says , though Hitchcock pushed him to the point of irritation : " You think he does n't like you , but he just wanted the most out of you , and you understand that when you win the Cup . " <p> Others who had an important impact include American NHL star Neal Broten and tough guy Basil McRae , both teammates in Minnesota . " Neal was pretty quiet like me . He left the game at the rink , and then his life started after that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethic like no one I 've ever seen . He taught me not to take your talent for granted . " <p> His only regret : He wishes he would have had more time playing with good buddy Brett Hull . " It would have been fun to see what we could have done together , " Modano says . " Hull 's passing is underrated . " <p> Building American players <p> Modano is proud to be so close to the American scoring mark , but he says he 's almost " embarrassed " by it , too , because he believes others are deserving of the attention . Top U.S. players such as Roenick , Housley , Bill Guerin , Keith Tkachuk , Doug Weight , Chris Chelios and others are all from his era , and he has nothing but respect for their accomplishments . <p> He played with Guerin and Tkachuk on a line in international competition , and they believed him to be far too mellow for their taste . " They had that Eastern mentality , " Modano says . " They were always ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play , and if I was n't at that level , they thought I was n't prepared to play . But we worked it out . " <p> He does n't want Housley 's feats as an accomplished offensive defenseman forgotten : " He is the perfect fit for the phrase ' quarterback of the power play . ' " <p> When Modano was drafted No.1 overall in 1988 , he was only the second American to accomplish that . There have been four other Americans since to go No.1 ; last summer Patrick Kane ( Chicago Blackhawks ) and James vanRiemsdyk ( Philadelphia Flyers ) went one-two . About 30% of the picks in that NHL draft were Americans . <p> " I think you can see the improvement in the American program ... ( in ) that we are getting players from all over the country , including Dallas , " Modano says . <p> Bachelor no more <p> Modano has always been a fan favorite . As he prepares to become the top American-born scorer , he has given up his unofficial title as the NHL 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford , 26 , in a small ceremony in Dallas . " I was more nervous than about anything I 've ever done in hockey , " says Modano , for years the subject of articles trumpeting his status as the NHL 's sexiest player . <p> Modano did n't have a bachelor party , and the joke is he did n't need one because his life has been an ongoing bachelor party . <p> " I actually could n't wait for that ( wedding ) day to come , " Modano says , laughing .
