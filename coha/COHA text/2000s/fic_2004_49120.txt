Here 's a story that 's as American as baseball and apple pie , only it 's about movies and rocket ships ( and yes , Mom too ) . Warning-critics take note : This story is n't technically science fiction , but it 's so close that we doubt you 'll mind . When we published Daryl Gregory 's first story back in 1990 , he noted that he 's the son of Tennessee mountain people and grew up in Illinois . Since then he has lived in Michigan , Utah , Pennsylvania , and Iowa . In short , he was raised by southerners in the midwest , before moving north , west , and east . Now only slightly dizzy , he 's back in State College , Pennsylvania where he splits his time between writing and programming . His last story for us was " Free , and Clear " in the Feb. 2004 issue . <p> WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN , MY best friend , Stevie , built his own spaceship . In a certain light , at a certain angle , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , balanced on four thrusters , braced by stubby delta wings . The body and wings were warped plywood . The thrusters were four fifty-gallon steel drams , painted black , rimmed in aluminum foil . Later , police determined that Stevie had packed one of the drums with plastic milk jugs full of hydrogen peroxide distilled down to hydrogen monoxide - homemade rocket fuel . People heard the explosion as far away as Boone , five miles west . I was a lot closer . At the edge of the field , maybe fifty yards away , both arms resting on the rail of a chain link fence . The fence stopped some of the bigger shrapnel , and that 's probably the only reason I 'm alive . I carry my piss around in a bag now , and I stump around on crutches . But otherwise I 'm fine . It 's just a body , after all . It 's not me . That 's what Stevie was always saying , anyway . I try to keep that in mind . The block where Stevie and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel trains of ranch homes parked under old pines and mountainous weeping willows . Some houses had gotten new paint , and a few back porches had become glassed-in family rooms , but nothing essential had changed . They were still just Masonite boxcars with small windows and big shutters . The real estate agent did n't want to sell me a house here . She kept trying to show me the new " developments , " two-story houses on tiny , treeless lots on the north side of town where there used to be only cornfields . But I wanted to live here , on my block , preferably in the same house I grew up in . Stevie and I had grown up side by side , in houses so similar that our families could have swapped without having to buy new furniture . My old home , however , was n't for sale . My parents left it years ago , while I was at college , and moved to Arizona . The current owners had torn out the hedges and fenced the yard , but had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the house at night . Months ago I 'd had the agent make inquiries , but they did n't want to move , even at twenty-five percent over market value . My second choice opened up all on its own . It was on the other side of Stevie 's house , well within the hundred-yard range I required for my project . The owners had been the Klingermans , people I 'd barely known . They did n't have children , but they did keep little yippy dogs , terriers or something . Stevie 's parents , the Speros , still lived in the same house . My new bedroom window faced the window to Stevie 's old room . The drapes were light blue now instead of Spider-Man red . My first night in the house , sleeping on the floor because the furniture had n't arrived , I could hear their new baby squalling . On summer nights , Stevie would shimmy out of his bedroom window , cut across the back yards , and hiss through my window screen to come sneak out with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . If my parents were both asleep , and if I could work up the courage , I 'd go with him . He was the same age I was , but ten pounds lighter , a skinny kid with pale , lank hair , thin lips , and translucent skin . Even by moonlight you could make out the blue vein that ran from his temple to his jaw . The park was five blocks away , the quarry less than a mile . We 'd dodge headlights the whole way , pretending every car was a cop out to bring us in . We 'd dive into a ditch , and then he 'd look at me and say , Oh man oh man that was so close . We were scared of getting caught , especially by Stevie 's dad . Mr. Spero scared me more than anyone else I knew . But we went anyway . We built a fort in the trees beside the quarry . We talked about aliens and spaceships , but we did n't know anything about real rockets , or real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battlestar Galactica . The summer after seventh grade , we started making movies ; really , one long movie with dozens of unconnected scenes . My dad had gotten a video camera for Christmas . It was a big , bulky thing , though we did n't think so at the time . Since it was my dad 's camera , I was the Cameraman and Director . Stevie was in charge of Story and Special Effects . Most of the effects required fishing tackle . We strung ten-pound test line between the trees and glued hooks to the tops of the models . Stevie would pull the ships from twenty feet away , reeling them in with a fishing rod . I would lie on my back , a cassette deck held up close to the mike to provide background music , and videotape the ships as they jerked overhead . We wanted to get the stars behind them , like the opening scene in Star Wars . The stars never came out on the tape . We staged improbable space battles : a two-foot wide Millennium Falcon versus an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. a Japanese Zero and an Apollo 11 rocket . We stuffed firecrackers into exhaust ports and turrets and blew them apart . We doused the models with gasoline , lit them ( ignorant of the impossibility of fire in space ) , then yanked off the escape pods with fishing line . After Stevie died , the papers made a lot of this obsession with spaceships and explosives and fire . The Signs Were There , if someone had Only Paid Attention . Bullshit . Of course we were obsessed with spaceships and things that go bang . We were American boys in Bumblefuck , Iowa . " Timmy ? " " Hi , Mrs. Spero . It 's just Tim , now . " She stood on her front porch , holding something that looked like a toy walkie-talkie - a baby monitor . The baby was somewhere inside ; I did n't hear it crying . " You 're moving in ? " She sounded surprised and happy . I 'd seen her look out her front window a half dozen times since the Atlas truck pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised voice . To remind herself not to look at the aluminum crutches . I nodded toward the two guys carrying a dresser into the house and managed a smile . " Sort of . Most of the furniture 's going into the back bedroom until I can get the carpets taken out and the floors refinished . " She stepped off the porch and walked toward the driveway , moving slowly , as if unspooling a safety line behind her . The baby monitor 's red LED pulsed every few seconds . Mrs. Spero had been one of the young moms , the hot moms , a fitlooking woman who pulled her hair into a ponytail when she worked and wore sleeveless shirts in the summer . Even before I hit thirteen I started watching whenever she reached to a high shelf , waiting for a glimpse of white bra and curve of skin . She was in her late forties now , and though still attractive she looked worn out . Her face was puffy , and she 'd gained weight in her hips . Her eyes , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had the new baby done this , or had the transformation started earlier ? I told her my folks had gotten the Christmas card with the birth announcement inside . " William Ray . That 's nice . He 's what , eight months old ? " She smiled , surprised . " Next Tuesday . We call him Will . You have a good memory . " She asked about my family . I told her my parents were looking forward to retiring in a few years . My older brother was still in grad school . My sister was in Maine , with a kid of her own . The monitor 's read-out rose and fell . I could n't help looking at it . She told me about my house and the neighborhood . Mr. Klingermari " had died of a stroke , and Mrs. Klingerman moved into a home . She did n't know what happened to their dogs . We talked about the new people on the street , and the few changes in town . " So , where are you working ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be telecommuting . " " Oh . Right at home . Working on a computer , I guess ? " " I analyze quality control data for a parts manufacturer . " Nine times out of ten , this is as far as I have to go to explain my job . " Well , that sounds .... " She searched for a back at her house . " I better get back . " " Can I listen ? " She looked blank for a moment , then smiled . " Sure . " I held the monitor to my ear . The baby seemed to be sound asleep , each deep breath loud and fuzzed by static . " I can hear the ocean , " I said , and she laughed . I looked at the back of the device and noted the brand name . " This thing 's amazing . You can hear everything . " " Almost too much . Every little breath . " " I bet . Well , tell Mr. Spero that I 'll be here all the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " STEVIE MADE BIGGER and bigger models out of painted plywood and pieces from other models . He blew them apart with M-80s that could rip open a mailbox . I would n't give him my dad 's video camera anymore , but he stole a Super-8 camera and a projector from the school A-V room and switched to film . He could n't do sound anymore , but he did n't mind . Video is a cold medium , he told me . One night the summer after freshman year , we were coming back through the yards at 3 A.M. Stevie had the camera , and I was pulling a wagon full of props and models . We came around the corner of the house and saw Mr. Spero . He was sitting in a lawn chair under Stevie 's window , a plastic tumbler in his hand . I dropped the wagon handle , but before I could take off he told me to stand there , and I was too afraid to move . He made Stevie drop his pants , right there in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the house . Stevie was already crying . Mr. Spero stood up , unlooped his belt , and folded it in half . He held it by the buckle , and slapped it against Stevie 's thighs . The boy yelped , and started bawling . I 'll give you something to cry about , Mr. Spero said . Sometime during the beating I ran to the back door of my house , not even bothering to sneak , and ran into my bedroom . My mom tried to get me to tell her what was going on , and I blubbered something about Stevie and his dad . A few minutes later , Mr. Spero was at our front door . My dad went to the door barefoot in his robe , and then he called me in to the living room . Did you sneak out ? he asked me . I nodded . Do n't do it again , he said . And that was it . I stood there for a moment , stunned , and then ran out of the room . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put my ear to the wall above the sink . Mr. Spero kept talking , in a low , spiteful voice . My dad did n't say much . When Mr. Spero finally left I heard Dad say to Mom , That man 's the southbound end of a northbound horse . I was fourteen , and thought that was the wittiest thing my father had ever said . And then I started wondering . How long had Mr. Spero been sitting there in the dark , waiting for us ? The baby monitor Mrs. Spero used broadcast at 43 kilohertz . I bought a scanner in Des Moines and tuned in to Radio William . I listened to him whenever he was on . The format was pretty regular : He cried , he breathed , he jabbered in his private language . I learned to differentiate the various cries , from hunger to anger . He had a special kind of yelp when he wanted to be picked up after his nap . Mrs. Spero would come to retrieve him , speaking to him in her calm way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she was speaking into my ear . At night I would lie in bed and try to time my breaths to his , but he was too fast , like a rabbit . Mr. Spero was a background noise , a distant rumbling that occasionally resolved into words . I listened for any change of tone , waiting for the flat contempt he 'd used with Stevie . That first week I watched him leave for work in the morning , and come home in the afternoon . He looked the same : pale skin and thin lips , hair combed back on his forehead in a minipompadour . Only the hair color had changed , from sandy brown to white . I unpacked , and shopped on the Internet . Most of the sites encouraged homeowners to be paranoid : about their babysitters , their housecleaners , or anyone coming within twenty feet of their front door . I was amazed at the range of equipment available . I put together a complete package for less than two thousand dollars : cameras , digital switcher , software , antennas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next couple of weeks . I played with my new toys , and I listened to Radio William . All Stevie 's movies - our movies - were part of a long saga called The NovaWeapon Chronicles . The plot was impossible to explain , even to ourselves , and changed depending on whatever special effects were available . We shot parts of the story over and over when we changed our minds or got better models . There were large gaps in the story that we never filled in . Most of the " chapters " had to do with Rocket Boy , played by Stevie in black snow pants and a mesh shirt . Rocket Boy was the only kid our age ( twelve , fourteen , sixteen ) who could pilot his own starfighter in the Counter-Revolutionary StarForce , which we 'd called the " Rebel Alliance " until some kids said we just copied it from Star Wars . In the later chapters Rocket Boy became the strong silent type ; once we 'd switched to film we could n't record dialogue anymore . Stevie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at the controls reacting to unseen laser shots , or gazing meaningfully into the distance . I appeared in various roles , from Flight Commander to Alien Overlord . My younger brother was drafted into playing ensigns , lackey aliens , and especially corpses . Stevie said Hitchcock used Bosco for the shower scene in Psycho , but we found out that Karo Syrup was cheaper , and looked just as good . On black and white film , Karo looked more realistic than real blood . For the action shots , Stevie 's stunt double was a G.I. Joe with life-like hair and Kung Fu grip . We dressed up the action figure ( never a doll ) , inserted him into scale models , and then punished him in various ways . One day during summer vacation - this was the year before Stevie died , in 1991 - we threw the Joe off the side of the quarry about fifty times . It was ninety degrees and ninety percent humidity , and I was losing interest in the Chronicles . But there was nothing else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he needed me to film . Rocket Boy 's starfighter had been hit , and his escape pod had burned up in reentry ( or something ) , and Rocket Boy was supposed to parachute the rest of the way down . So Stevie stood at the top of the cliff with a handkerchief bunched around Joe , and I was at the bottom of the pit with the Super-8 shooting up into the Sun . There was no wind down there and no shade and sweat was pouring off me . And the fucking handkerchief would not come open . Joe just crashed into the rocks , over and over . And every time he hit , Stevie yelled down , Did you get it ? Did you get it ? Like there was anything to get . After two hours Joe 's face was looking like he 'd been in a knife fight . I climbed out of the hole with the camera hanging from a strap around my neck , yelling that it was his turn to sit in the pit and broil . Stevie was pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink , but before he tugged down the shirt I saw a dark stripe on his chest . What the hell is that ? I said . This ? He lifted his shirt . A long , thin welt , like a snake wending its way from his collarbone to his navel . That 's nothing . What did he use on you ? Stevie shrugged . One of my cables . Holy shit , I said . That had to kill . He shrugged . Not really . Pain 's just a signal from the equipment . Like a telephone ring . It only has to hurt if you decide it should hurt . He 'd been talking like this all summer . The body is a machine , the mind is a pilot . Yeah , I said , you 're a regular man of steel . I 'll prove it to you , he said . Punch me . Oh , you do n't want me to punch you , I said . This is an ugly thing that Stevie brought out in me . I was bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in unbreakable headlocks , manhandle him into closets , make him cry if I wanted . I did n't do it often , but I liked knowing I could . So he tried to slap me and I knocked his hand away . Come on , come on , he said , and kept slapping . I fended him off , and flicked a few shots at his chin . He started swinging wildly , and I pushed his arms away , and then his fist connected with my lip . That pissed me off . So I socked him in the side of the head . He spun away from me , a hand over his ear . See ? he said . His eyes were welling with tears , but he made himself laugh . Okay , good , he said . He charged at me again , throwing crazy punches , a tantrum , going for velocity and damage and not even trying to protect himself . You could only fight like this with your brother , or your best friend . We went on like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , my fist raised . But I could n't hit him while he was flat on the ground , bleeding , and smiling at me . He dabbed at his nose , and held up his red hand . Sprung a leak , he said . Sure , I said , and it does n't hurt a bit . Nope . Why 'd you start crying then ? He shoved me off him . Nobody has total control , he said condescendingly . Too many systems are on automatic . But I 'm working on it . I do n't remember what I said at that point . Some crack . Stevie shook his head and pulled up his shirt . You think this is me . This , he said , running a finger down the bruise , is hull damage . He grinned . The pilot , he said , is intact . He pointed at his eye . Behind there . Can you see me ? Hey man , I 'm waving at you . " It must be hard to do this again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the same green wrought-iron patio furniture they 'd always had . " You mean , at my age . " She was breastfeeding William , holding him close with a blanket draped over her shoulder and covering her breast , but he was a big guy , and kept yanking off the blanket . I kept looking away . " No ! Well - " " It 's all right . You know , I did n't breastfeed Steven . Back then , formula was supposed to be better . You were a formula baby , too . " She glanced up at me . " I never would have planned on this . But it happened , and I would n't trade him back . " " Of course not . " " Still , it 'll be good to get away . " Mr. Spero was going to a convention over the weekend , and she was taking William to her sister 's house in Cedar Falls . " Thank you for watching the house , by the way . " " Not a problem . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head lolled sideways , eyes half closed . He looked drunk . She dabbed the thin milk from the corner of his lips , and he smiled . Then she did something to her bra ; and deftly buttoned her shirt . All with one hand . " Do you still have any of Stevie 's movies ? " I asked . She did n't look up . " You know , the videos , or the film cans ? " She shook her head slightly , still not looking at me . " I do n't think so . I 'm sure they 're gone . " " Gone where ? " " We gave a lot of stuff away , after . Boxes and boxes . " The car pulled up behind me , the engine loud against the side of the house . I turned around , putting a smile on my face . Mr. Spero stepped out of the car , his suit coat over one arm . " Well look what the cat dragged in . " He said it lightly , a little chuckle behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire told me you 'd moved in . I could n't believe it . " He draped his jacket over the back of one of the patio chairs . His shoes were still shiny , his bright yellow tie still cinched , as if important clients might ring the bell at any moment . " Now where 's my boy ? " He took the child from Mrs. Spero and turned to me . " He 's a big one , is n't he ? What a monster ! " It was true . He looked like he 'd be much bigger than Stevie , more solid . " Careful , I just fed him , " Mrs. Spero said . " I need to go turn on the oven . " She disappeared into the house , and Mr. Spero jiggled the boy in his arms . " So what brings you back to our little town , Timmy ? It ca n't be the job prospects . " " I work over the Internet , " I said . " My office can be anywhere . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " The baby started to fuss , and Mr. Spero sat down where Claire had been . " There we go , there we go . " He patted his back , and the baby twisted his head back and forth , knuckles crammed into a slobbering mouth . " So why come back here ? " Mr. Spero said . " I 'd think that someone in your situation would want to be near family . " " Situation ? " I kept my face blank . I waited for him to glance at the crutches leaning against my chair , or the bulge under my shirt from the flange and colostomy bag . Just glance . He stared at me over the top of the baby , and huffed . " Never mind . No one could ever tell you what to do . Or your dad , either . " The baby pushed up on his legs and grabbed one of his father 's ears , and Mr. Spero shook his head back and forth playfully . " I like this town , " I lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch over the neighborhood . Make sure it stays a nice place to raise kids . " " So you sit in your room and type on your computer . That 's a hell of a job . " " I analyze quality control data for a parts manufacturer . " The baby grabbed an eyebrow , and Mr. Spero said " Ouch ! " and pulled his face away . He held the baby 's hands , and the boy stood shakily . Mr. Spero bounced his legs , and the baby went up and down , grunting : hyuh-hyuh-hyuh . " I try to explain catastrophic failure , " I said . " Like when a tire blows out , or an O-ring disintegrates on lift-off . " " Really , " Mr. Spero said . The baby grinned madly . Mr. Spero chuckled and bounced him higher . " Estimating catastrophe time is a different problem , statistically , than estimating gradual wear - you get a Weibull distribution rather than a normal curve . We do test-to-failure runs , and just try to grind a part into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out why some things fall apart too soon . I sort through all the variables and find out which ones contributed to failure . " He ignored me . William looked ecstatic . " A lot of the time , it 's because of some flaw from early in the manufacturing process , like a hairline crack in the seal , say . " The baby 's head dropped forward , and a mouthful of gray fluid dumped onto Mr. Spero 's shirt . William grinned , ready to play . " Damn it ! Claire ! Claire ! " He thrust the baby away from him , dangling it in the air . The child spit up again , spattering the floor , and started to howl . Claire rushed out of the house , a towel already in her hand . " Were you throwing him around ? You know what he 's like after - " " Christ , Claire , can you just get him off me ? " She took the baby from him and Mr. Spero grabbed the towel from her . He dabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this , " he said . I held up my arms . " Here , let me take him . " Mr. Spero threw down the towel and stomped into the house , already unbuttoning his shirt . She shook her head . " I need to clean him up , " she said . " Maybe you could come back after .... " " Naw , I 've got to get going anyway , " I said . " And you 've got to pack . Enjoy your trip . I 'll take care of things here . " I SAID THAT HE WAS my best friend . That 's a lie . Sophomore year , I stopped making night runs with him , I stopped helping with the movies . I barely talked to him at school . I 'd gotten onto the soccer team , and I had a group of good friends , some of them seniors . I had a girlfriend . What the hell did I need Stevie for ? He never stopped pestering me . I remember when he stopped me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-size starfighter out of silver-painted plywood . See ? He flipped open his notebook to his Storyboards . He showed me a cartoon of a stick figure climbing into the hatch of a starfighter . The ship was maybe three times taller than the pilot , and drawn in much more detail . You built this ? It 's almost done , he said . He flipped pages . Now , he said , we switch from live-action to the models . The panels showed the launch , then a far shot of the starfighter rising through the clouds , then a closer shot of the ship outlined against black space . Look , he said . It 's all there . It 's a two-stage rocket . God , he could be so pathetic . I do n't remember any bruises on him that day , though at some point I 'd stopped looking . It was easier to stop worrying about Stevie in the winter . With our windows closed we could n't hear Mr. Spero shouting at him . I took the book from him . Jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Lasers or something ? The NovaWeapon , he said . It hits his ship . In the next panel , Rocket Boy ejects . The last picture showed him in close-up - the stick figure filled up most of the frame , anyway - floating in space . He ca n't eject into space , I said . He does n't have a space suit . He 'd die in ten seconds . We 'll make a suit , Stevie said . I tossed the notebook back to him . Do n't be a fucking retard , I said . Even in the dark , I could tell that there was nothing left of Stevie 's old bedroom . The shelves crammed full of plastic models were gone . The paneling and wallpaper had been pulled down , the walls painted glossy white and trimmed in pastel blue . The bed was gone too , replaced by a crib . The bed frame had been blond wood , with panels in the headboard where Stevie kept his paperbacks , videotapes , Super-8 cassettes , and cans of developed film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the house in the dark , not wanting to turn on the lights and alert the neighbors . The basement had been divided into rooms and partially finished , but the other rooms looked pretty much as I remembered . The main difference was that every trace of Stevie , except for a few pictures , had been removed . It took me most of Friday night and part of Saturday to install the cameras and mikes and routers . I needed spots that were high up , with wide angles . The finished rooms in the basement were easy , because the drop ceiling tiles could be pushed out of the way . The upstairs rooms were harder . These ranches did n't have much of an attic , just crawl spaces above the house and garage that you accessed through little square holes . The work was draining : hours balanced on the beams trying not to put a leg through the insulation and plaster . I was used to working one-legged , but after a half hour I was sweating and trembling from exertion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a lot of breaks . I ran power from the light fixtures , drilled down through the plaster ceiling , and popped the little fish-eyes into them . Each camera was about as big as a fifty-cent piece , and most of that was above the ceiling . The lenses themselves were smaller than a dime . I wired the circuit boards on the backs of the cameras to the digital switcher , which was broadcasting at 2.4 gigahertz . I put the antenna next to the wall facing my house . According to the specs I did n't need the antenna - I should have been able to pick up the cam signals from 700 feet away . But if there 's anything my day job has taught me , it 's that spec-writers lie . Only three cameras came on without a hitch . The others had cabling problems of one type or another , and I had to spend another two hours crawling around in the attic . Last , I had to vacuum all the plaster that had dropped onto the floors . The house would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday night I had everything working . I could sit at my desk and tab through most of the rooms in the house from my PC . I went in again Sunday morning , and this time I actually watered the plants . Then I went room by room and searched every closet , trunk , and suitcase , looking for anything of Stevie 's . I spent a lot of time in the storage room , going through Rubbermaid containers filled with Christmas decorations , photo albums , and old clothes . Under the basement workbench , hidden behind a toolbox , I found two new Jim Beam bottles , one empty , the other down to a couple brown inches , with a plastic cup over the neck . I put them back exactly as I 'd found them . Except for one box of grade school papers , there was nothing of Stevie 's in the house . It was n't until nearly noon that I remembered the attic space above the garage . I had no idea when the Speros were coming back . But I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor of the garage and hauled and hopped my way up the stepladder to the square hole . I pushed aside the lid and groped above my head until I found the string for the light . The junk was half-familiar , stuff that could have come from my own family . A box for a plastic Christmas tree , a rotary fan , a set of kitchen chairs I remembered , taped-together boxes with pictures of toaster ovens and car stereos and power tools . I stumped deeper into darkness , toward a stack of cardboard boxes . The seams were thickly taped . I used my keys to poke and saw through the tape . The first box I opened contained a metal box , like a typewriter case . " Ames H.S. Library " was stenciled on the side . I flipped the metal clasps and pulled off the top . It was the Super-8 film projector . There was even a spool of film on the arm . I knew it . I knew they had n't thrown it away . I worked my way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things into the light . It was all there : the notebooks , the videotapes , the film cans . Even the models - two boxes filled with nothing but plastic spaceships and props . I 'll pay you , he said . He was standing under my window , in broad daylight . He wore black cargo pants , shiny black combat boots . He even had on dark eye shadow . He looked like a dork . Why do n't you come to the front door like everybody else , I said to him . And then : How much ? Ten bucks . It 's the last scene . The last time I 'll ever ask you . All you have to do is hold the camera . I 'm not : going to sneak out of my window for ten bucks . Twenty bucks . Come on , you know you have to see this . It was a Saturday afternoon , and I did n't have anything else to do . I went out through the back door , though I made sure nobody saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked annoyed . You 're going to take the money ? I held out my hand . I did n't want it - I just wanted to see if he had it . And if he 'd really pay me . He handed me two tens , and I stuffed them in my pocket . All right , I said . You 've hired a cameraman . My house became a studio . The bedroom office was already wired to receive the video broadcasts from my cameras . In the living room I moved the couch to face the large blank wall , and set up the projector on the end table . I pushed the TV and VCR into the corner , so I could watch the videos without leaving the couch . I spent my nights moving between the two rooms , watching whatever I was in the mood for . That first Sunday , before the Speros had even returned , I watched the first tape . Stevie had numbered the videotapes and film cans , so I was able to place them in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Timmy , and interminable scenes of plastic models being jerked along on fishing line . I expected it to be worse than I remembered . But it was worse even than that . I started watching with the idea that I would capture the interesting or well-done bits and edit them into something coherent . But the videos were almost unwatchable . Often the screen was so dark I could n't tell what was happening , and most of the time I could n't remember what we 'd intended . I was the only person on the planet who could possibly appreciate the NovaWeapon Chronicles , and I was fast-forwarding through hours of it . The stream of images from next door , however , never stopped flowing , and those never bored me . Even when I was working , I kept a window open on my desktop that I could maximize whenever something caught my eye : Mrs. Spero mopping the kitchen , barefoot . Mr. Spero slipping into the basement and back in less than a minute , like a magic trick . I 'd never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was riveting . I could follow them from room to room , with a few exceptions . I had n't put cameras outside , or in the garage . And I had n't put any in the master bedroom or bathroom . I did n't want to be able to see the Speros naked , or having sex , because I knew I 'd watch . Still , it was a small house . I 'd like to say that I shut down the window the first time I saw Mrs. Spero walk from the bathroom to the bedroom with a towel around her waist . I never even reached for the mouse . I found the televised William even more fascinating than the audio-only version . When he slept , he abandoned himself totally : jaw slack , arms thrown to the side . When he cried , he threw his entire body into it . I admired his focus . Sometimes when he was crawling toward a certain toy , or reaching toward the airplanes that dangled above his bed , I could see him thinking . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , it was ; mostly Mr. Spero who got up to hold him . He picked up William without . a word , and walked around the house like a sleepwalker , letting the boy cry himself out . After work , he threw William around like he had on the patio that day . He rarely changed diapers or bathed the child , but he did get on the floor and play with him . Had he been like this with Stevie , at first ? Before Stevie crossed him for the first time , at the wrong time ? Perhaps he liked his children better when they were small and helpless and compliant . I waited for that moment when Mr. or Mrs. Spero would look up at the ceiling , squint at the discolored plaster , and go get the stepladder . But no one looked at the ceilings except William . Sometimes he 'd be on his back , staring straight up at the camera , and I 'd pretend that he knew . That some baby instinct told him I was up there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . Hiya , Will . What are you thinking about , down there ? We walked out to the quarry , Stevie lugging the camera and a gym bag . The starfighter was set up on the field on the other side of the pit . It was twenty-two feet tall , sitting nose up like the shuttle before launch . The body was primer gray , with the red and black Counter-Revolutionary StarForce logos on each stubby wing . The foil rims around the thrusters glinted like hammered metal . Holy cow , I said . You really did it . It was only when we moved around the side that I could see that the back was unfinished . The cylindrical body was hollow , the two ends held together with crosshatched strips of unpainted wood . The back does n't matter , he said . We 'll only film it from the front . On the grass behind the ship were paint cans and stacks of cloth and empty milk jugs . One huge cardboard box overflowed with crumpled brown plastic containers . Stevie had been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extension ladder out of the grass , and we propped it up against the side of the ship . The structure shuddered and swayed . I climbed up , excited despite myself . Stevie had managed to make a curved clear hatch out of two sheets of Plexiglas . It fastened to a wooden crossbar with big hinges , so you could swing it open and closed . There was a little platform in there , with a metal folding chair on its back , so Stevie could sit with his face to the sky . The flight stick was a black broom handle , the instrument panel a slab of wood with painted-on controls labeled in the alien alphabet we 'd made up in eighth grade . A car battery sat next to the chair , close to where Stevie 's head would be . The red and black clamps of jumper cables lay next to the battery , unattached . The cable disappeared through a hole in the platform . What 's the battery for ? Special effects , he said . Even with work and hours spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters in a week . I promised myself I 'd take more time with the Super-8 footage . The films required more of a ritual . Before viewing each reel I spooled through it by hand , reconnecting the sections where the splices had broken . Stevie had sometimes used real splicing tape , but more often he 'd used Scotch tape that had yellowed and split . The Bell and Howell projector was touchy . I learned how to thread the film with a loop of slack to stop it from stuttering . I learned how to replace the lamps , ordered over the Internet from a warehouse in Oregon . The filmed chapters were much better than the tapes . Shorter , for one . The film cost money to develop , so we could n't let things just run on and on . And Stevie had edited down from there . His technique matured from reel to reel : he paid attention to time of day and the location of props , he showed exterior shots before jumping to the interior , and he cut cleanly between characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right : Video was a cold medium . It 's too specific : all harsh colors and wind noise and tinny dialogue . Better to reduce to shades of gray and silence , and develop slowly in darkness . I do n't know where the warmth comes from . Maybe something in the act of projection : the lamp blasting each frame onto the screen , suffusing it with light , reconstituting each tree and person and building in photons . I took my time . I watched only one reel a night , though I allowed myself to watch it multiple times . After all , there was no reason to hurry . There was no final reel . Once there 'd been a Super-8 cassette , undeveloped , pulled from the wreckage of the camera . Maybe it still existed . Maybe the police still had it , or the Speros , hidden in some niche I had n't found . Or maybe they 'd burned it , and no one would ever see it . It did n't matter . I knew how the story ended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras . Channel William , his ongoing saga broadcast live to my PC , was never in reruns . Some nights I slept on the futon in the office , so I could check on him just by opening my eyes . I 'd long since stopped feeling like a voyeur . I felt like I was in the house with them , intangible and invisible . The family ghost . I climbed down the ladder , shaking my head at how much work he 'd put in . The whole structure swayed with my weight . Is that thing going to hold you ? I asked . It does n't have to stay up long , he said . This is the last scene I need to film . How can this be the last scene ? What about ejecting into space , the whole space suit thing ? How can you have him ejecting before you even launch ? Do n't be a fucking retard , he said , in the same snotty tone I 'd used . This is the last scene I need to film . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll put it all back together in the editing room . You mean your basement . He rolled his eyes . So what did you make the space suit out of ? I asked . There is no space suit . And when he ejects , what ? Suffocates ? Explodes in the vacuum ? Stevie did n't answer . Really ? Rocket Boy dies ? What do you care ? he said finally . I started laughing . Come on , five years of the Nova Weapon Chronicles and they just shoot him out of the sky and he dies ? That 's like killing off Luke Sky walker . Obi-wan died , he said , and came back in the sequels . Only as a ghost . Ghosts do n't count . Stevie ignored me . He pulled off his T-shirt and squatted to open the gym bag . His back was covered with bruises so blue they were almost black . Holy shit , I said . He pulled the black mesh shirt out of the bag . Do n't worry about it , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shirt , and he was Rocket Boy again . There were any number of things I could have said or done . New ones still occur to me . Listen , Stevie said . I want a long shot - an establishing shot . He handed me the notebook , page open to the storyboards . Just like that , he said . Stand over there by the fence . Film me getting into the rocket , and closing the hatch . Make sure you get me moving inside the cockpit , so they know it 's not a model . Just keep filming until I tell you to stop , got it ? Do n't turn off the camera . Obi-Wan was only a supporting character , I said , and started walking across the field . THE NIGHT I SHOULD HAVE been paying the most attention , I was in bed , in the next room . I did n't even have the scanner on . The screams came through the computer speakers in the office . I do n't know how long they 'd been going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . I bolted out of bed and stumble-hopped down the hall without my crutches . I swiveled the monitor to face me . The baby was on the floor , shrieking . Mr. Spero stood over him , dressed only in pajama bottoms , his fists on his hips . William had never made a sound like this before . It was a screech , as if he 'd been cut or burnt . Mr. Spero abruptly squatted , grabbed the baby under the armpits , and carried him out of the room . William was still screaming . I switched to the hall camera , but Mr. Spero walked straight into the master bedroom and I lost him again . Fuck . I clicked through the camera views , but I could n't see a thing . But I could still hear William . That piercing cry was being picked up by all the microphones . I rushed back to the bedroom and pulled on a pair of sweats and a T-shirt that pulled down over flange and bag . I grabbed my crutches and lurched outside , bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mashed the doorbell , then without waiting for an answer , banged on the wooden door and yelled . " Open the door ! Now ! Open the door ! " No one answered . I could still hear William screaming . I twisted the doorknob , but it was locked . " Mr. Spero ! Where are you ? Where 's the baby ? " The door flew open . Mr. Spero 's skin under his robe was fish white . " What the hell do you want ? " he said , shocked . I pushed forward , and got inside the frame of the door . " Show me the baby . " " Get the hell out of my house ! " " Show me William . " He started to close the door , but I lunged forward , got another leg inside . Mr. Spero raised his right fist . " What are you going to do , Mr. Spero ? Hit me ? " I wanted it . Local Man Hits Crippled Neighbor . I was n't worried about being hurt - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He slammed the door back against the wall . " Get out of my fucking house . " " Not until you show me the baby . " Mrs. Spero came into the room , wearing the green nightgown , holding William on her shoulder . He was quiet now . She frowned at me . " Tim ? It 's two A.M. " " I know , I just - " I could n't say , what was he doing on the floor ? Did Mr. Spero drop him ? Throw him on the ground ? " I heard him screaming . " " Babies do that , " Mr. Spero said . I ignored him , and looked only at Mrs. Spero . " He 's all right ? Are you sure ? " She turned slightly , so I could see William 's face . His eyes were screwed up tight , and he was sobbing , but he did n't look bruised or hurt . " Is he all right ? " " He had a stomach cramp , " she said . " He 's fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squared off by the viewfinder . Stevie on the first rung of the ladder , knee raised , hands gripping the rails . Higher , a dark look over his shoulder - not toward me , but toward some point in the distance , perhaps the enemy troops flying in . At the top , the lid of the cockpit open like a beetle 's wing , and Stevie gazing into the crowded compartment . From my desk I watched her place the baby in his crib . He had fallen asleep in her arms , and barely stirred as she laid him on the mattress . Mr. and Mrs. Spero exchanged only a few words , then disappeared into their bedroom . I sat in front of the PC for an hour , watching and listening . William 's face was dimly lit from his nightlight . The house was absolutely still except for the sound of his breathing . I went into the living room , too wired to sleep myself . I picked up the can of film I 'd set aside for tomorrow night 's viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last reel before the never-developed Last Reel . I checked the film , going slow because it was heavily edited , spliced every dozen frames . He 'd worked hard on this one . Eventually I threaded it into the projector and flicked on the lamp . No sound except the clack of sprockets in the brittle film . The titles came up : a hand-stenciled sign . The NovaWeapon Chronicles . Flick , and the sign changed . Final Chapter . I frowned . So far , Stevie had never made a chapter that spanned two reels . The movie could n't be complete without the scene I 'd filmed . The screen flashed - sun glare on the lens - and out of the white a tiny silhouette plummeted out of the sky . The camera cut to another angle : the same figure , still far away , falling and tumbling , arms and legs outstretched . Then another cut , and another , each shot from a slightly different angle , and the figure fell closer and closer . I saw a flash of rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered filming it , shooting up from the bottom of the pit , staring into the Sun . And then there were new images , things that Stevie had filmed himself . I finished the reel , rewound it , watched it again . A dark shape in the Plexiglas bubble like the pupil of an eye , his hand lifted in a StarForce salute . I answered the door still wearing the sweats and T-shirt I 'd pulled on the night before . She held a squirming William on one hip . She turned toward the door as it opened , and smiled in a way that seemed rehearsed . " Tim , I wanted - are you all right ? " " I 'm fine . " My eyes felt raw . I probably looked like hell . She paused , and then nodded . William pulled at her shoulders . " I 'd like to talk about last night . " " Sure . " She smiled again , nervous . " Let 's not do this on the front step . This boy is heavy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible for his mother to drop him . He looked fine . Absolutely fine . Mrs. Spero had never come into my yard before , much less my house . I glanced behind me . The drapes were pulled , and the room was dim . The box full of films and tapes sat in plain sight on the floor . The projector was next to the couch , aimed at the wall . " It 's kind of a mess . " " I promise not to tell your mom , " she said . A thin smile . I did n't open the door . " I 'm sorry if I upset you , " I said . " I know what you 're doing , Tim . " My face went hot , and I smiled automatically . " Yeah ? " " You 're looking out for me . For the baby . But you do n't have to do that . " " I do n't ? That 's what neighbors do for each other . " " John 's different now . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , " I said . " That 's really good . " " You do n't believe me . " " I 'd like to believe you . Does it matter ? I hope you 're right . " William squawked at me , excited but serious , frowning like Alfred Hitchcock . I held my hands out to him , and he grabbed my fingers , hard . I laughed . " He stopped drinking , Tim . " She waited until I looked at her . " You know he used to drink ? " I shrugged , still holding William 's hands . I 'd only figured this out later , after college , after I 'd met a few people who were in recovery . When I was a kid , I 'd noticed Mr. Spero always had a drink in his hand . But he was n't a drunk . That was Otis on the Andy Griffith Show . " I guess that 's a pretty good excuse , " I said lightly . " It 's not an excuse ! " I dropped William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spero shifted him higher on her hip . " That 's not what I 'm saying , " she said , her calm voice back again . " But you have to understand , he was a different person then . He should n't have been so hard on Stevie , but - " I stared at her . Hard on him ? Did she not know ? Had n't she seen the bruises ? No , of course not . She had n't seen a thing . None of us had . " Tim , people can change . There are second chances . I know you may not want to believe this , but after Steven 's suicide - " " It was n't suicide . " I struggled to keep my voice level . " What ? " " He showed me the storyboards . It was n't a suicide . It was a plan , in two stages , like - " " Tim , stop .... " " It was a launch . The starfighter is destroyed , but Rocket Boy ejects . The pilot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes wet . " Oh , Tim . " Her voice was full of pity . For me . " There 's something you need to see , " I said . The ship , splintered with light . In the middle distance , the hint of bright metal and wooden shards , blurred by speed and spin , slicing toward the lens . WE SAT ON THE COUCH like a little family , William between us , sitting up by himself and obviously pleased . Mrs. Spero regarded the blank wall , her face composed . She had n't commented on the projector , or the box full of videotapes and film cans . She must have recognized them . I turned on the projector lamp and the light hit the white wall , askew . I adjusted one of the legs and the image straightened . The machine chattered through the blank leader tape . William ignored the light and sound . He abruptly threw himself forward , making for the floor , and Mrs. Spero automatically put out a hand . " Could I hold him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flickering wall , and I moved my hands under his arms . I was surprised how heavy he was . I sat him on my lap , facing me . He was unimpressed . The opening titles appeared . The final chapter . If she was surprised , she did n't show it . I might have been showing her the dense data tables I worked with . In silence we watched the tiny figure falling out of the sky , falling out of the light . Reentry . The figure drew closer , until finally the rock walls flashed up and Rocket Boy hit the ground . The camera switched to a point just above the pit floor , tilted slightly down . The sheet - the parachute - settled over the ground and covered a man-shaped lump . Touch down . Mrs. Spero looked at me . " Just watch , " I said . " He filmed this himself . " Before the explosion , before the Death of Rocket Boy . Nobody films in sequence . William twisted around , looking for his mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right there . I got you . " I jiggled him on my good knee , wondering at what frequency and duration his stomach became unstable . The screen darkened . It was night , and the camera looked down from the top of the quarry . At the bottom , the sheet reflected the moonlight . It was too big to be our handkerchief , and the lump it covered too long to be G.I. Joe . The camera switched to the floor of the pit , tripod level . The " para- chute " glowed prettily , but it was obviously just an ordinary cotton sheet , with none of the sheen of silk . The sheet moved , and a naked arm reached out , fingers twitching . I had to smile , imagining the melodramatic background music Stevie would have wanted . The arm was streaked with fake-looking blood . Too pale , too shiny . He should have used Karo . William pulled at my T-shirt , trying to get his feet under him . On screen , Rocket Boy tossed back the sheet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was curled into a fetal position , naked . The blood described rivulets across his arms and neck . His back was covered with dark blotches - bruises . On film , they were too flat , too black , like holes through his pale skin , as unconvincing as the blood . Stevie slowly got to his feet , facing the camera . Naked , pale skin shining . He looked up to the stars . " The Return of Rocket Boy , " I said to her . Rocket Boy raised his arms in triumph , held them there . The screen went black . Mrs. Spero sobbed almost silently , her shoulders jerking with ragged breaths . The last of the film ejected . The reel continued to spin , the tail of film slapping the body of the projector . Mrs. Spero stared at the square of empty light . William yanked at the collar of my shirt . I lifted him in the air , and his face cracked open into a wild grin . His eyes were bright . I recognized that look . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , and he cackled . Hey there , little man . Can you see me in there ? I 'm waving at you .
