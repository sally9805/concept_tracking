Chapter One The cougar had already moved two of her young to a new hiding place . Suddenly she stopped , a third cub dangling in her mouth , one of her paws poised midstride . Nova Blair held her breath . Until this moment the morning air on this **25;328;TOOLONG bluff overlooking Gunsight Canyon had been as still as death . Hoping to capture a photo that National Geographic itself would snap up in a millisecond , Nova had taken a gamble and eased out from her blind . She 'd moved into the only position where she could get a shot not only of the mother carrying the cub but , in the same frame , the other two cubs playing just outside their lair . But only a few heartbeats ago Nova felt a cool caress across the back of her neck . And that stirring breeze had carried her scent to the mountain lioness . The cougar turned her head in Nova 's direction then set her cub on the rust-red sandstone so typical of the Indian Country around Lake Powell . Nova 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stuffed the Nikon into the soft-sided camera bag looped across her chest and under her jump harness . Smiling at the cat and speaking as she stood , she said , " Seems it 's time to make an emergency exit , but I still gotcha , you beautiful thing . " Nova turned anddashed for the stone shelf one hundred feet away . It jutted finger-like into the space over the long drop to the canyon floor . The skittering sound of loose pebbles followed , the sounds of a cougar racing to catch her . From the stony finger 's tip , Nova threw herself into the void , arms and legs stretched wide to gain stability . Below lay the canyon floor , seemingly barren but for a feathery lime-green trace of tamarisks along the lake edge . And beyond , the magnificent lake itself , azure-blue against vast miles of red sandstone buttresses , cliffs and palisades that eons of wind and water had carved here . Nova pulled the rip cord of the base jump canopy , felt the sudden yank in her crotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began a gentle , controlled glide to the ground . This morning her hike up to the blind she put in place yesterday , when the first cub had been moved , had taken two and a half hours . The trip down would take less than a minute , her ride to the airport and then the flight back home to San Diego maybe five hours and tomorrow she would develop some of the best photos ever taken of the American cougar in the wild . " Beautiful , " she yelled , the words of joy whipped away from her mouth by the wind and carried down the canyon . Valdez , Alaska , 1:00 a.m . Sunday , May 15 The fishing trawler Polaris sliced through heavy drizzle and a calm sea at the mouth of Port Valdez Bay . From the aft deck a man in black peered through the Arctic darkness toward the shore , a tight knot of excitement like a clenched fist in his chest . Along the shore the pipeline terminal lights stood out like diamonds against black velvet . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old wound . He stroked the damp , corpselike cheek and sucked another lungful from his cigarette . In ten minutes they would launch the Zodiacs . He snuffed the cigarette on the heel of his boot , jammed the butt into one of his flack vest pockets and entered the cabin . Nine pairs of eyes fixed on him . These were The Founder 's elite - Earth 's Warriors . Every man here had trained in the special forces of various armies before their dedication to The Founder , but still two faces showed fear : the Nigerian , Kariango , and the Frenchman , " Slow Jack " Soustelle . " You two look ready to piss your pants , " he said in English . " It 's time to fix that . " He strode to the forward bulkhead , fished out the key on the chain around his neck and opened the locked compartment . He removed a small , gray box that captured the men 's attention as though it were a priceless jewel . The Founder 's enforcer laid the box on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently plucked the pencil-thin , pale yellow glass ampoule from its foam cushion . He held it up so the men could see it . " Speed . Strength . Fearlessness . One smell of this and you 'll be ten times the men you are now . " He scanned all their faces . " Ready ? " Dark-painted faces nodded . The men gave him grunts of eagerness . Slow Jack said , " Damn right ! Bring on the coffee ! " The Founder 's enforcer snapped the ampoule 's slender neck . There was a slight click , and then the smell of burned coffee quickly diffused through the cabin . He sucked in a deep breath of the drug and felt immediately the flutter of an accelerating pulse . The others followed his example . The drug was altering their bodies , their fight response heightening in a way that made them - short of death itself - invincible . A test bar of steel , half an inch thick , lay on the table . He picked it up and , bare-handed , bent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Get the boats into the water . " Thirteen minutes later he huddled with his men on stony ground fifty feet up from the shoreline , hidden under starlit darkness and four camouflage thermal blankets . The security system set up by the Alyeska pipeline oil partnership was ridiculously inadequate . A single fence , half a dozen cameras and only a token force of armed security guards . No motion detectors , no dead man 's entrance , no slalom barriers . Only a few feet away lay a dead-end cul-de-sac in the road near Loading Berth Five . The drizzle thickened into cold , pelting sleet . Finally the red security truck appeared . He nudged Wyczek . The two of them shimmied free of the blanket , hugged the ground as they moved apart till they reached the pavement on opposite sides of the cul-de-sac . The truck entered the turnaround and circled . Wyczek rose . The dummkopf driver 's mouth dropped open in amazement . The man hit the brakes , fumbled at his holstered gun . The enforcer bolted across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . He grabbed the door , ripped the thing off its hinges and tossed it aside , then pulled his combat knife . The driver turned . The enforcer slid across the seat and rammed his blade under the ribs , up into the man 's heart . " Terra eterna , " he whispered . He holstered the knife and then grabbed the driver 's twitching body with both fists , yanked it from the truck and threw it like a rag doll to the side of the road . With his men , he piled into the truck bed . Wyczek leaped into the truck cab and drove them back toward the terminal entrance . They turned right onto an access road to the upper levels , cruised past the Operations complex . The enforcer scanned for signs of danger . " Still no alarm , " Slow Jack muttered .
