In a makeshift ballroom at Ford Field , the Detroit Lions ' stadium , a Beatles tribute band is playing I Want to Hold Your Hand , which has got the lite of Motor City moving and shaking , but not the hosts of the black-tie charity ball , William Clay Ford Jr . and his wife Lisa . In fact , the 48-year-old CEO of Ford Motor Co. is getting teased by his brother-in-law about his ineptitude on the dance floor . Turning to a reporter , Bill owns up to it . " You do n't want to see that , " the Ford scion says with a laugh . But he gets serious when the topic turns to his day job and what lies just around the corner for his employees : a sweeping restructuring that will bring tens of thousands of layoffs . " Honestly , I do n't worry about myself , " he says . " I mean , I can screw up my life , and it does n't really matter "  --  a fair observation for a man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worry about is the impact all of this has on others . We 're going to do what we have to do , but it 's just very , very sad . " <P> Why did Bill Ford , great-grandson of the auto company 's founder , take on this responsibility when he could have left it to hired professionals ? It helps to understand that he is a man of epic contradictions . His family practically invented the auto industry , not to mention blue-collar consumerism . Brilliant , cantankerous Henry Ford made the first mass-produced car , the Model T , and paid workers enough so they could afford to buy one . That makes great-grandson Bill industrial royalty : he comes from a competitive , dynastic clan that can not be separated from the nameplate on your Mustang . But he also has a complex , even squishy side ; he 's a passionate environmentalist who has studied Buddhist philosophy and thinks a lot about the future of the world . <P> So while he worries about his employees , Ford Motor 's boss believes  --  belatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will save the family firm , which , like General Motors , seems to have all but lost a 30-year war with Toyota and other foreign companies for dominance of the U.S. auto market . This week he is unveiling a plan , which he calls the " Way Forward , " a last-ditch effort to save the company by taking some big chances . Ford has surrendered market share in the U.S. but figures that a smaller , more innovative company can stir more passion among its customers . <P> He wants to blow up the company 's hierarchical traditions , trim the ranks of bureaucrats and encourage a climate of risk taking . He will go out on a limb with bolder car designs ( in fact , one new model is called the Edge ) . And he will gamble that saving the planet from the car industry is the biggest long-term priority of all , so he will pour billions of dollars into eco-friendly factories and cars . Most notably , the company will dramatically increase production of its hybrid gas-electric models , promising to produce 250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's output . " The old way of doing things does n't work , " Ford says . " Is this risky ? Of course it 's risky . But I tell you what : Going the way we were going is the highest risk of all .
