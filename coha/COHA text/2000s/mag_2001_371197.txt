Grasping for a model of how to better protect against terrorist hijackings , some commentators are suggesting that the U.S. adopt Israel 's practices . That system has worked pretty well , especially given what an attractive target Israel 's airports and airline are to terrorists . Ben Gurion Airport , near Tel Aviv , Israel 's only international airport , has an enviable record . No flight out of there has ever been commandeered . A 1974 TWA flight originating in Tel Aviv was blown up , but only after taking on passengers in Athens . Only once , in 1968 , was the national carrier , El Al , successfully hijacked . <P> How do the Israelis do it ? For one thing , El Al puts at least one armed , plainclothes sky marshal on all its flights . One such agent foiled a hijack attempt over Holland in 1970 . During El Al flights , the cockpit door , made of reinforced steel strong enough to repel fire from a handgun , remains locked . <P> On the ground , the Israelis not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean on teams of young agents , dressed in blue slacks and white shirts , who interrogate , to varying degrees , every passenger departing Ben Gurion and , in airports abroad , anyone flying El Al . The questions can include : " When did you book this flight ? " " Who paid for the ticket ? " " Why are you traveling ? " " Whom did you meet while in Israel ? " Business travelers are asked for documents proving they actually are pursuing a particular deal . Journalists are asked to reveal the stories they are going to cover . One agent will ask questions for a while , then a second will ask many of the same . The two will compare notes , and one or the other will ask a third batch of queries . This process often takes 20 minutes ; it can take two hours . <P> The idea is to turn up inconsistencies in a terrorist 's made-up story ( or at least rattle him into a panic ) and also expose individuals who may be unknowing accomplices . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered a bomb sewn into the suitcase of an unwitting Irish woman after she revealed that she had had a romance with a Jordanian , who had bought her the bag . <P> Even to innocents , the interrogation is unsettling . It entails a violation of privacy that most Americans would find objectionable . Beyond that , the system requires a degree of ethnic profiling that would be viewed here as bigoted . Even with the moderate traffic at Ben Gurion , the Israelis ca n't grill everyone at length . So Israeli Jews get only pro forma questions like " Who packed your bag ? " Foreign Jews get a relatively light going over . Foreign Gentiles get half an hour or so . And Arabs , including Arab citizens of Israel , get a full inquisition . <P>  --  By Lisa Beyer
