Section : JUSTICE VS . TERROR Devout and steely , John Ashcroft has found a new mission in the battle against terror . <p> John Ashcroft was reaching for inspiration . On a misty Washington night last week , the attorney general led a group of U.S. attorneys  --  his field commanders in the war on terror  --  on a tour of the city 's monuments . Standing before the imposing Lincoln Memorial , he draped an arm over the shoulder of a prosecutor from North Carolina and recited a passage from Lincoln 's stirring second Inaugural Address , delivered during the Civil War , which is carved on the wall of the monument . The other federal prosecutors quietly read along , joining in the incantation . Since September 11 Ashcroft has repeatedly turned to history for solace  --  and justification  --  as he wages his campaign against terror . In November he called on his " lawyer-warriors " to follow in the paths of their predecessors who fought the " fascists and communists . " <p> Briefing President George W. Bush at the White House each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seizing every opportunity to spread his new gospel in televised press briefings , Ashcroft has found his mission , and his voice . A devout Pentecostal , Ashcroft is embracing his new role with quasi-religious zeal  --  and without a hint of uncertainty . Under his direction federal prosecutors and FBI agents are questioning thousands of Middle Easterners living in the United States . He quietly issued new rules allowing the government to hold suspected terrorists indefinitely . To help " disrupt and eliminate " terrorist networks , he launched a nationwide dragnet , sweeping up hundreds of foreign nationals , detaining most on minor immigration charges . Many have since been released after officials concluded they have no connection to terrorism . Should the government apologize to those who were wrongly accused and detained ? " No , " the attorney general told NEWSWEEK last week . Everyone arrested , he insists , had broken the law  --  even if it was a minor immigration infraction . " The United States of America , " he said , " does not apologize to law violators . " <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney general 's nationwide crackdown and high-flown rhetoric recall unseemly periods from the past , when constitutional rights were swept aside in the name of national security . But his tough talk and actions have made Ashcroft a hero to law-and-order conservatives , who admire his stern , no-excuses approach . " John loves to talk about how people ought to live and how people ought to behave , " says one longtime political adviser . " He is relishing the role . " <p> He did n't always cherish it so much . Before the terrorist attacks Ashcroft seemed bored and restless at the helm of the Justice Department . He took the job only after an embarrassing political defeat  --  losing his Senate re-election to a dead man . His opponent , Mel Carnahan , went down in a plane crash during the campaign . When Bush picked Ashcroft for Justice , the lawmaker 's former Senate colleagues rose up and nearly defeated his nomination  --  payback for his years of inflexibility on issues like abortion and judicial picks . <p> After years in the intimate , clubby hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125,000-person bureaucracy a frustrating chore . Never camera-shy as a senator , he bristled at playing attorney general to a president who preferred that his cabinet officers stay in the background . Intimates say he seemed uninterested in the mundane details of antitrust law and tax enforcement . When a prosecutor and FBI agent had to fly out to his Springfield , Mo. , home one weekend to get his signature on a wiretap application in a terrorist case , Ashcroft was so irritated by the intrusion that he gruffly put his pen to paper , then sent them away . <p> Since September 11 , friends and colleagues say , Ashcroft has developed a much lighter touch even as he 's hardened some of his views . Once a staunch member of the GOP 's libertarian wing , Ashcroft railed against racial profiling and government snooping on the Internet . Now his critics charge him with rolling over civil liberties on both those fronts . Ashcroft 's friends say he is fired by a messianic sense of mission ( he 's the son and grandson of fundamentalist Christian preachers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the right thing , " he told NEWSWEEK . Some close to him believe he may use his high profile as a launching pad for another run at the Senate  --  or even the White House . <p> Though he clearly believes he is on the side of the good , at times Ashcroft 's grasp of the facts can seem tenuous . Explaining last week why he wo n't release the names of hundreds of foreign-born nationals who have been locked up on minor immigration charges , Ashcroft told reporters , " I do not think it is responsible for us in a time of war ... to advertise to the opposing side that we have Al Qaeda membership in custody . " Senior officials overseeing the investigation were surprised by the answer . Though a handful of possible Al Qaeda suspects have been picked up , none is currently being held on immigration charges , officials say . " I do n't know where he 's getting his facts from , " says one top Justice official . <p> Ashcroft deliberately avoids getting mired in such details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to grasp policy points and legal nuances  --  he went to Yale and is a University of Chicago-trained lawyer  --  but he does n't always take the time to get the details down before he goes in front of the microphones . Unlike like past attorneys general , he abandoned the practice of meeting daily with the heads of key Justice Department offices . Instead most officials must funnel recommendations through a coterie of loyal young staffers Ashcroft brought with him from the Senate . <p> Some Ashcroft aides worked closely with White House lawyers to develop the Bush administration 's most controversial plan : the far-reaching order that gives the president the power to establish secret military tribunals . Ashcroft 's enthusiastic backing of the plan angered plenty of Justice veterans , who believe the court system is perfectly capable of trying terrorists  --  especially those captured in this country . <p> This week the attorney general will have a chance to explain the Justice Department 's hard-nosed antiterrorist campaign on Capitol Hill , when he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee . It could be a tough day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration  --  and Ashcroft  --  failed to consult them about the tribunals and other key decisions . Ashcroft 's former colleagues will be looking for more than stirring oratory  --  they 'll want details , and answers . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Bush , the AG says , ' should have the right to protect innocent American lives <p> By Daniel Klaidman and Michael Isikoff <p> With Tamara Lipper and Debra Rosenberg <p>
