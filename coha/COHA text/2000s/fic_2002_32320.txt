Chapter One From the front seat of his beat-up Chevy truck , Dirk Bennett stared at his girl 's third-story apartment . He watched the shadowy figures of two people come together and stay that way . A minute passed , then two . Then the apartment lights went out . Dirk 's fingers trembled , and his heart ricocheted against the walls of his chest . He glanced at the revolver on the seat beside him and shuddered . What was wrong with him ? He was a nice guy from a nice family . People like him did n't carry guns , did n't lose sleep at night hating a guy for stealing his girl . Maybe I 'm going crazy . Or maybe it was the pills . They could do that to a person , could n't they ? Make you crazy in the head ? No , that was paranoid . Dirk calmed himself down . The pills had nothing to do with the way he felt . They were n't even steroids-not exactly . And they were working . He 'd packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled his regular dosage . Ten pounds of muscle . Dirk gripped his forehead and tried to remember what his trainer had told him when he sold him the bottle . Get the formula right . Too little and the lifting would be worthless . Too much and ... Rage , depression , irrational behavior . Was that what this was , this constant buzzing in his head ? Too many pills ? Dirk tapped his fist against his forehead . It was impossible . The pills were completely natural ; that 's what every-one said . Half the guys at school were on them , and no one else was having any kind of reaction . He stared at the gun again . It 's what anyone would do . He was n't going to hurt Professor Jacobs , after all-just scare him . Then Dirk and Angela Manning could be together the way they should have been all along . He had known from the beginning that Angela was the one , the only woman he could ever love . She 'd felt it , too , at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze to Angela 's apartment . What could she possibly see in that guy ? He was at least ten years older than she was , with thinning hair and gray in his beard and the beginnings of a paunch . Besides , Professor Jacobs was married . Dirk had seen the man 's wife up in the journalism department a time or two , a beautiful , dark-haired woman who laughed and smiled and seemed to be in love with her husband . The whole thing did n't make sense-an old man like the professor with two gorgeous women . Dirk bit the inside of his lip . That part would change soon if he had anything to do with it . In the glow of a streetlight he glanced at his watch and saw it was after ten o'clock . If he wanted to pass history , he 'd better get home and write the paper on Civil War generals . It was due tomorrow . Dirk worked the muscles in his jaw as he grabbed the gun and tucked it underneath his seat . He 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started his engine , he got an idea-an idea so sound and strong it caused a surge of hope to rise in his heart . Maybe he would n't have to use the gun . Maybe there was another way to scare the professor into backing off his girl . He chuckled out loud as he pulled away from the curb . Ten minutes later he sat on the floor of his Indiana University dormitory room , staring at a single entry in the Bloomington white pages as his fingers began punching the numbers . Not many blocks away , Professor Tim Jacobs lay awake in his girlfriend 's off-campus apartment , wondering what was happening to him . He was used to the guilt and insomnia . But the tears were something new . Since he 'd begun violating his wedding vows , there had been too many times when he was supposed to be at work reading student papers or at one conference or another but instead had been sharing a bed with Angela Manning , possibly the most promising student ever to grace Tim 's advanced newswriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tim knew their affair was more than a passing distraction . Sometimes the realization caused the guilt to grow so loud that it almost took on a voice-a voice that kept Tim awake even when he was dead tired . The voice was not audible , but many nights it woke him all the same . Tim would be nestled against Angela , intoxicated by the kind of sin he 'd never even dreamed about , when from out of nowhere the voice would come . Repent ! Flee immorality . I stand at the door of your heart and knock ! Flee ... Tim would roll over , hoping to find his way back to sleep , to the imaginary place where his wife , Kari , would not be waiting at home alone , trusting him to be faithful . But the voice of guilt would come again and again-persistent , relentless , tirelessly calling him home regardless of his lack of response . His lack of worth . Tim shifted onto his side , trying not to waken Angela . He stared at her plain white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela Manning first visited him at his office and made her intentions clear . They had talked for fifteen minutes , teasing and laughing and sharing sentiments of mutual admiration while Tim twisted his wedding ring , hiding it behind the fingers of his right hand . When Angela left the room , a scent of musky jasmine remained . And enough heat to warm the building . Tim spent the minutes before his next class savoring the way she made him feel . But as he left his office that day his eyes settled on a plaque Kari had given him for their first anniversary . It bore the engraved image of an eagle in flight and words he remembered even now : The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth ... to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him . In that moment everything about serving the Lord had felt binding and restrictive . Without too much thought he swept up the plaque , dropped it in the nearest file drawer , and strode out of his office . It remained hidden in the drawer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plaque no longer applied to his life ; it was best left out of sight . His strength did n't come from having a heart committed to God . Not anymore . Since the hot August night when he and Angela first slept together , Tim 's strength had come from being with her . And from his professional accomplishments , of course . Tim had devoted his career to excellence in print , first as a working journalist , then as a teacher of the craft , training a yearly crop of reporters who would carry on America 's devotion to preserving a free press . In relatively little time , he had become a respected professor who also wrote a regular column for the Indianapolis Star . In the most influential circles of the discipline , Tim 's name was gaining recognition . That was a kind of strength that made a difference in life . Another reason for his power was his absolute commitment to journalistic integrity both in the field and in the classroom . Back when he was reporting , he had never revealed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used to be a church-goer-he had never let his religious faith stand in the way of his ability to practice objective journalism . Religious bias had no place either in the newsroom or in the educational process-not when a reporter could do his best work only with an open mind . Kari had always struggled a bit with Tim 's thoughts about faith and the press . But not Angela . She treasured the fact that Tim was a " man of faith , " as she put it . But she also admired him for his ability to put aside his personal beliefs when he wrote a column or lectured to a class . " We never knew exactly where you stood on issues , " Angela had told him later , transfixing him with her electric blue eyes . " But we always knew you stood for good journalism . We knew you 'd never cave , never give in . Do you know how rare that is these days ? " He was Angela 's hero , no doubt . It was something he 'd known from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk after class the spring of her junior year and had asked him out . " Professors ca n't date their students , " he told her , stifling a smile . She simply held his gaze , her directness both disconcerting and alluring . " Can they have lunch together ? " They had lunch . The office visit happened a week later . After that , month after month after month , he fought the temptation . After all , it truly was policy that a professor could n't date a student currently in his classes , though the university 's Ethics and Harassment Department had long since agreed that there was nothing wrong with a mutually consenting relationship once the shared class had officially ended . So Tim had held back , flirting with Angela , enjoying lunches and study times with her , but refusing to cross the line . When summer came and Angela returned to her hometown of Boston , Tim felt relieved , glad to be free from the guilt of their flirtation . He tried to put Angela behind him , to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , too busy to spend time with him , often too tired to respond lovingly to him at the end of the day . When Angela returned to school , Tim finally had to admit the truth to himself , even if he was n't ready to admit it to his wife . He was in love with Angela Manning . Deeply , completely in love . It was wrong , no doubt . But he could n't deny his feelings or the way she left him unable to choose anything but time with her . And it was since that realization that the voice of guilt had been nothing short of relentless . Repent .... The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy . The voice spouted Bible verses at him , passages he 'd memorized as a boy but had n't read in years . I have come that you may have life , and have it to the full . Tim liked that one least of all . Life to the full . As if reading a Bible or going to church every time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela made him feel . Life to the full ? The Bible was obviously mistaken on that point . In Angela 's arms life had never been more full . So Tim had gradually let go of the beliefs that had once been the foundation of his life-a foundation that now seemed flawed and almost ridiculous . He 'd doubted some of the details for a long time , of course . A world made in six days ? An ark with hundreds of animals , floating above a world of water ? People cured of diseases by simply taking a bath or having their eyes covered with mud ? Tim had long ago written off such events as either symbolic or simply irrelevant . But recently he had started to ask even more fundamental questions . What if God did n't exist after all ? What if the Bible had been made up by a group of religious leaders intent on dictating the moral fiber of a society gone bad ? What if real life , real truth , lay in the finding of one 's soul mate ? Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ? Someone like Angela . In the weeks since he and Angela had begun sleeping together , the questions had gradually become statements in his mind , until now he was ready to let go of the crutch of religious tradition entirely , ready to embrace the reality of new life with his new love . What he was n't ready to do was tell his wife , and therein lay the struggle . He knew that the only right thing was to confess the affair . But when Kari met him at the door each evening , he could n't bring himself to look her in the eye and tell her the truth . That he wanted a divorce . That he was in love with another woman-a student , no less . It did not take a psychiatrist to figure out the most likely source of the guilt that interrupted his days and kept him awake at night . And it was n't hard for Tim to convince himself that the whispered flashes of Scripture were figments of his imagination , a consequence of confused brain signals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose not to dwell on the fact . The guilt would pass in time , once he acted on his decision to leave Kari , once the stress of a double life was behind him . The voices would eventually stop , though for the time being they made sleeping almost impossible . And that 's where things were different now . For weeks the guilt had awakened him with gently persistent preachy sentiments about truth and repentance . But lately , that same guilt had been waking him with something else . Tears . These thoughts , all of them , came in the time it took to realize it had happened again . In the midst of a perfectly good night 's sleep next to a woman who had captured his heart and intoxicated his senses , Tim Jacobs , respected professor and ace columnist , was crying . Weeping quietly as if someone had died . Tim blinked to clear his vision , and suddenly he knew that someone had indeed ceased to exist . Himself . Quietly , discreetly , he silenced the sobs and wiped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul , a sadness so deep and true he ached from the power of it . As if a veil had been lifted from his heart , he saw everything he 'd once been-the idealistic boy , the energetic teenager , the God-centered college student , the hardworking journalist , the romantic groom . The loyal husband . That man was dead . His betrayal of Kari had fired a final , fatal bullet into what remained of the man he 'd once been . There in the darkness , with Angela curled up beside him , lost in sleep , the sadness within him grew . He cried for Kari , the sweet young woman to whom he 'd promised a lifetime . He cried for the children they 'd never have and for the growing old they 'd never do together . Tim swallowed back a lump in his throat and tried again to clear the tears from his eyes . Where were these feelings coming from ? Why were they hitting him now ? His love for Kari had cooled long before he met Angela . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed to be with Angela , Kari deserved better . Why have I let things get so bad ? What 's happened to me ? What have I become ? The answers were ugly and came as quickly as the questions , forming a stranglehold on Tim 's heart . As strong and capable as Tim thought himself to be , the depth of sorrow that surrounded him now was enough to destroy him . It was a moment that would normally be accompanied by the voice of guilt , assuring him that even now redemption was his for the asking . But as Tim cried quietly into Angela 's pillow , mourning for the first time the man he 'd once been , the marriage he was about to lose , and the fact that he had no intention of changing his mind , he realized something that was more heartbreaking than the other losses combined . The words on the plaque Kari had given him were right . Without God he was n't as strong as he 'd thought . Not at all . And that 's why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
