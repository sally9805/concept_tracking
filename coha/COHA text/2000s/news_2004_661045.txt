<p> Nearly three years after the attacks of Sept. 11 , a national commission blames no one agency or administration for the strikes , but makes it clear that many errors occurred prior to that fateful day . <p> It leaves open the question as to whether the attacks could have been prevented , but in total it portrays a strike against America that did not come out of nowhere . It was rather the result of a growing threat that perhaps could , and should , have been foreseen . <p> Top officials all told the 9/11 commission that they understood the dangers of Al Qaeda - but commissioners in the end became convinced that there was uncertainty at the top as to whether this was just a new and especially venomous version of the longstanding terrorist menace , or whether it was indeed something radically new . <p> The most important failure was " one of imagination , " says the final report . " We do not believe leaders understood the gravity of the threat . " <p> In the end , the bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be this : The US government still needs a profound reorientation to better fight terrorist threats to come . <p> The report could well launch a national conversation about tragic events still fresh in memory , and about the control and limits of intelligence-gathering - all in the heated context of a presidential election year . <p> Does Congress need to exert more oversight of intelligence agencies ? Should a powerful secretary of intelligence sit in the cabinet ? How does the Department of Homeland Security really fit into this effort ? Important questions , say experts . <p> But they are questions that should be discussed , without sharp partisanship . " Any time you 're talking about the restructuring of a major national security instrument of government , that ought to be done when people are weighing and considering it , and not hurling it into each other 's faces to make a political point , " says William Webster , who has served as director of central intelligence and the FBI . <p> The 9/11 commission ( formally known as The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations to help prevent future strikes on the homeland . These recommendations were unanimously approved by the panel 's five Republican and five Democratic commissioners . In general , the report urges a three-pronged approach to antiterrorism security : attacking terrorists and their organizations , preventing the continued growth of Islamist terrorism , and protecting and preparing for terrorist attacks . <p> " The first phase of our post-9/11 efforts rightly included military action to topple the Taliban and pursue Al Qaeda , " said Vice Chair Lee Hamilton . " But long-term success demands the use of all elements of national power - diplomacy , intelligence , covert action , law enforcement , economic policy , foreign aid , public diplomacy , and homeland defense . " <p> To execute this strategy , the commission proposed a five-part plan : <p> * Link foreign and domestic intelligence and operational planning in a new National Counterterrorism Center ; <p> * Appoint a national intelligence director and create a National Intelligence Center ; <p> * Centralize and strengthen Congressional oversight of intelligence and homeland security ; <p> * Strengthen the national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Departments of Defense and Homeland Security . <p> From the White House to the halls of the CIA , the common reaction to the report 's release was : This deserves serious study . <p> After receiving the report from leading commission members yesterday , Bush said , " I assured them that where government needs to act , we will . " And Sen. John Kerry , the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate , said , " There are imperatives that we must move on rapidly . " <p> But this is not to say that the nation 's intelligence community welcomed recommendations about how it should be organized with open arms . A senior CIA official who briefed reporters made it clear that the agency considers itself in the middle of the war , and it wants nothing to disrupt what it sees as wartime-level activities . <p> If the nation is to have a new , more powerful intelligence oversight official , it should be someone who speaks to the president and the Congress in the effort to shape intelligence issues . It should be someone with real budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of the nation 's intelligence funds , as well as the CIA . <p> Of course , the head of the CIA is already nominally the holder of another job , director of central intelligence , noted the official . " The question then arises as to why you have not empowered the director of central intelligence to do those things , and why you should not , " said the official . <p> Mr. Webster says that it is his belief that the timing of the release of the report is unfortunate , coming as it does only months before an election . He worries that it will be used by one side or other to spin their positions on national security . <p> He adds that in his time in Washington he has seen a number of swings in national attitudes towards the CIA and intelligence-gathering activities in general . At times of national peril the voters allow greater leeway for US espionage . At times they feel safe , they want it reined in , believing in some way that such things are a bit immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendulum does n't swing too far in one direction . " <p> The commission members themselves know there is no simple solution to the problem . As Mr. Hamilton put it : " There is no silver bullet or decisive blow that can defeat Islamic terrorism . " <p> Still , commission members believe there is much that can - and should have been done - to reduce the threat . " The United States government was simply not active enough in combating the terrorist threat before 9/11 , " commission chairman Thomas Kean said . <p> The commission also notes that security agencies were n't the only ones who did n't understand the dangers before Sept. 11 . For example , during the 2000 presidential campaign , there was only one question about terrorism , said Kean : " That means the press did n't get it either . " <p> * Ron Scherer in New York contributed to this report . <p> Report 's political fallout for Bush , Kerry and Beyond <p> The 9/11 commission report challenges President Bush , in the heat of a political campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key advantage over Democrats in the public view : fighting the war on terrorism . <p> The report does n't hurt the president as much as it might have . The bipartisan panel does n't assign outright blame to the Bush administration for failing to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks . But it does identify missed opportunities and " deep institutional failings " that do not enhance the president 's bid to keep commanding the US war on terror . <p> The panel 's recommendations are sure to reenergize politically charged debates on Capitol Hill - notably whether to put more authority under one chief to oversee various US intelligence agencies . Mr. Bush is now noncommittal on such a move , while Democratic challenger John Kerry supports it . <p> Republicans now lead Democrats 45 to 30 percent on who can best fight terrorism , according to a Pew Center poll this week . <p> In a town where commission reports have the shelf life of vapor , the final report of the 9/11 panel marks a stark exception - for its timing as well as its conclusions . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission listed 10 missed " operational opportunities " to foil Al Qaeda in its plot . <p> " In eight months the Bush administration missed six things ; while in eight years , the Clinton administration missed four things , " reckons Robert Boorstin , a national security specialist at the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank . <p> " We 're right in the heart of a presidential campaign where terror and the war in Iraq are front and center . How can it not become front and center ? " asks analyst Stuart Rothenberg . Still , Iraq appears sure to outweigh a 9/11 blame game as a campaign issue . <p> - Gail Russell Chaddock <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
