The Queen 's Knife WILDE ISLAND AD 1145 MOTHER PULLED OUT HER KNIFE . We were alone in her solar . " It 's time , " she said . " Give me your hand . " I drew back . " It 's not yet Sunday eve . " " We 're together , Rosalind , and the door 's well locked . " " Tomorrow . " " Tonight . " Then softening her voice she said , " Come , Rosie , take off your gloves . " Her blade flashed in the firelight and sent a russet glow across the room . She was ready for the ritual . I dreaded it . " Take yours off first . " Mother placed her knife on the table and bared her hands . Queen Gweneth 's fingers were finely tapered as candles , her skin milky as the moon . It was a shame for her to wear golden gloves , but she 'd donned them at my birth to protect me , and worn them ever since . " Now you , Rosie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glove . Pretty hand that never saw the sun ; the skin was soft and creamy not unlike her own . Mother kissed it . Then taking my other hand in hers , she peeled away the left glove . None but Mother and myself knew what hid underneath . My throat tightened as we looked at my fourth finger . The horny flesh . Blue-green and scaly as a lizard 's hide . Claw of the beast with a black curving talon at the end . I rubbed the scar at the base of my claw . A wound I 'd made myself the night of Nell'switch burning . With her cunning craft Nell had lured folk into the woods and fed them to the dragon . Of this she was accused , and too she had a devil 's mark on her back . I 'd seen the mark myself before they burned her -- it was nothing compared to mine . With Cook 's sharp knife I 'd stolen to my room to try to cut off my cursed part . The wound was deep and the blood had drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peering at my claw now , working her face to hold back a sickened sneer , but with all her trying , her lip still tightened . " The sorrow of it , " she whispered . " That it should be your wedding finger . " " No man would marry me unless he was a leper . " " Rosie . Do n't say such things . " " Then say it is n't true . " Mother pulled out her silver vial , sipped the poppy potion , and closed her eyes . The fire crackled . When the lines around her eyes and mouth grew smooth she capped the bottle and set her jaw . " Now . " I hid my hand behind my back . " It will hurt . " " I 'll cut with care . " Tugging my wrist close , she used her knife to peel the black talon as a fletcher sharpens an arrow . Curled bits of hard black nail fell to the floor . Sparks flew and a trail of smoke rose as she trimmed the nail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For what kind of talon hides a spark ? Scrape . Scrape . I closed my eyes and smelled the odor of ground bone and , stranger still , a scent of rusted metal . The stench filled me with shame . I waited for her to finish , taking slow breaths to calm myself . Then I felt a sharp prick . " Too close to the quick ! " I drew back and blinked away the tears . " Done , " said Mother , sweeping the broken bits of nail into her hand and tossing them in the fire . Gently now , she slid my golden gloves back on and put her cool hand on my cheek . " This secret is heavy between us , " she said . " But do n't cry , Rosie . I 'll find a way to cure you . I swear it on my life . "
