These days , the question " Shall we dance ? " is both an invitation and a challenge . Hip-hop dance battles  --  much like the M.C. face-offs in the film 8 Mile  --  are becoming mainstream . The dance-battle scene has inspired a TV show ( MTV 's Wade Robson Project ) and a film ( You Got Served ) , and it even popped up at the Vatican ( the Pope recently blessed an acrobatic bboy performance ) . " It 's funny that it 's being recognized on this level now , because it 's been around , dominating in the urban centers for 30 years , " says Crazy Legs , 38 , a choreographer and ringleader of New York City 's Rock Steady Crew , a hip-hop dance group assembled on the streets of the Bronx in the late 1970s . " The hip-hop world 's emergence has opened the public 's eyes to all types of hip-hop dance , including battling . " <P> The battles draw on the head spins and jerky moves associated with break dancing . According to Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , on any given night in his club someone might engage in an impromptu dance battle . Says Sisk : " It 's a lot more interesting to see 700 or 800 people stop to watch two kids challenge each other through dance than to stare at the DJ all night long . " <P> It 's not just happening in New York . Dance battles are popping up at venues across the U.S. , including Atlanta 's popular club MJQ Concourse and Miami 's Opium Garden and Prive ( the site of a much-lampooned Britney Spears  --  Christina Aguilera dance skirmish last year ) . " In the clubs you see a lot of battles nowadays , " says dancer Wade Robson , 21 , creator of the eponymous MTV show ( he also plays himself in You Got Served ) . " Its foundations are in b-boy culture , but now these dancers are also incredible gymnasts , and they incorporate all styles of dance , from tap to salsa . " <P> The dance-battle scene is also seeing a growing number of women warriors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching and having your reputation on the line , " says Maryss , 23 , a West Coast  --  based dancer who frequently participates in competitions at clubs . " But even if you do something whack , the crowd will support you . "
