" I do n't want to die ... again , " Laszlo groaned . <p> Jack knelt beside Laszlo 's sprawled body . " Can I fetch you anything ? A warm cup of Type O ? " <p> Laszlo covered his mouth . " Do n't talk about food . " <p> " Mi dispiace . " Jack patted the Vamp on the shoulder , the only spot on the guy 's shirt that was n't soaked with spewed Blissky . Poor Laszlo . He 'd only drunk one glass of the whiskey-flavored synthetic blood when everyone had toasted the groom , but obviously the little chemist was better at making Vampire Fusion Cuisine than ingesting it . He 'd promptly thrown up all over himself . <p> There was n't much anyone could do for the poor guy , so the bachelor party had raged on in full force while Laszlo rolled on the floor , his face clammy and pale . <p> " Shall I help you move to the couch ? " Jack asked . <p> " I might get blood on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholstery on the Louis XV-style furniture . " It 's already stained . " What a mess . How would he ever clean this up ? <p> He rose to his feet with a growing sense of doom . It had seemed like a great idea when he 'd reserved an Edwardian suite at the Plaza on Fifth Avenue to celebrate Ian MacPhie 's last night as a bachelor . But now he realized the hotel 's housekeeping service would wonder how an innocent party could produce so many bloodstains . <p> Things had gotten out of hand after Dougal arrived with his bagpipes . Ian had insisted on teaching everyone a Scottish jig . A dozen tipsy Vamps hopping around with glasses full of Blissky had resulted in a few collisions and even more stains on the carpet and furniture . <p> And then the phone call had come . The ladies were at Romatech Industries having a bridal shower , though Jack had heard that Vanda was bringing a male stripper from her Vamp nightclub . The ladies ' party had come to an abrupt halt when Shanna Draganesti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romatech , Roman Draganesti had lamented that he was too inebriated to help his wife in her time of need . This had caused the other guys to rally around , declaring their undying support with a rowdy fight song . Then a dozen drunken male Vamps had teleported to Shanna 's side to cheer her on to victory . <p> Jack grinned as he imagined Shanna 's reaction , but the moment quickly faded . He had two hours before the sun rose to get this hotel suite back to normal . A noise from the adjoining bedroom drew his attention . Had one of the guys stayed behind ? Good , he could use the help . He strode into the luxurious bedroom and frowned at the naked VANNA lying on the bed , dripping Bleer on the satin comforter . <p> That had been Gregori 's bright idea . He 'd arrived at the party toting two Vampire Artificial Nutritional Needs Appliances , otherwise known as VANNAs . The lifelike rubber females were sex toys in the mortal world , but for Vamps , they 'd been modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sexy dolls with beer-flavored synthetic blood , and then he 'd invited the guys to have a bite . From the looks of the lacy clothes strewn about , the guys had had more fun undressing VANNA than nibbling on her . <p> A man 's voice drifted from the bathroom . " Oh , yeah , baby . Take it off ! " <p> Jack knocked on the bathroom door . " The party 's over . " <p> " The party 's never over for Dr. Phang . " The door opened , revealing Phineas McKinney . " What 's up , bro ? " <p> The young black Vamp looked debonair in his maroon velvet smoking jacket and white silk cravat , although the cavalier effect was marred somewhat by his SpongeBob boxer shorts . Like any vampire , Phineas did n't reflect in the bathroom 's gold-framed mirror , but the second VANNA did . The dark-tinted doll was sitting on the white marble vanity , wearing nothing but red silk panties and a silly grin on her face . <p> Jack was distracted for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ladies dig the Sponge . " Ah , sorry to interrupt . " <p> Phineas 's face turned a bit red . " I was just practicing , you know . When you 're the Love Doctor , you got ta keep your mojo in top condition . " <p> " I understand . " <p> " I bet you do . " Phineas grabbed the black VANNA off the vanity . Her legs jutted stiffly forward like a Barbie doll , and he pushed them down . " I heard you 're a real Casanova . " <p> " So they say , " Jack muttered . He could never escape his famous father 's reputation . " I suppose you were too busy to hear , but Shanna went into labor . All the guys left with Roman . Except Laszlo . He 's still sick . " <p> " No shit ? " Phineas strode into the bedroom with the black VANNA clasped under his arm . <p> " The sun will rise soon , so we need to clean up . " <p> Phineas glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bleer . " Damn , bro . We need professionals for this . How about Vampy Maids ? They clean Roman 's townhouse . " <p> " That would be great . Can you ring them ? " <p> " Do n't remember their number , but they 're in the Black Pages . " <p> They would never find the vampire version of a telephone book in the Plaza hotel . " Do you- " Jack was interrupted by a loud knock on the door . <p> " Expecting someone ? " Phineas 's eyes lit up . " Maybe some real women ? " <p> " NYPD , " a male voice shouted . " Open the door , please . " <p> Jack sucked in a deep breath . Merda . <p> " Hot damn , " Phineas whispered . " It 's the po-po . " He looked around frantically . " We 're in deep shit . " <p> " Relax , " Jack whispered back . " I 'll use mind control to get rid of them . " <p> " I do n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm outta here , man . " <p> " You 're leaving ? " Jack winced as the pounding on the door grew louder . <p> " Open the door now ! " the police officer yelled . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
