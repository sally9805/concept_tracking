Having written my first " Whither The Democrats ? " piece more than 20 years ago and followed it with too many other whithering rants about the donkeys , I have little appetite this time to do it again . After all , the Democrats took flagrantly responsible stands on the two most important issues of the election : in favor of muscular multilateralism abroad and fiscal responsibility at home . John Kerry ran an honorable , if not entirely competent campaign , while the Republicans skimmedthe outskirts of the acceptable with their nonstop negativity . And why give ammunition to oleaginous telecharlatans , like James Dobson of Focus on the Family , who have been puffing all over the airwaves since Nov. 2 demanding their pound of policy flesh ? <P> And yet ... <P> The Democrats do have a problem . It was partly illuminated by the exit polling , in which 22% of respondents said they voted , primarily , on " moral values , " and was reinforced by a subsequent Pew Research poll , in which the number rose to 27% . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters in 11 states , including Ohio , rushed to the polls to oppose gay marriage . But according to Pew , " moral values " was about more than social issues . Straight talk was seen as a moral value , and as Karl Rove has said , Kerry 's infamous " I voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it " was the most damaging 11 seconds of the campaign year . Nearly 1 in 4 of Pew 's " moral values " voters cited the " personal qualities " of the candidates . And 17% cited " traditional values " like " the way people live their lives . " In other words , nuance surfing and windsurfing and Kerry 's diffidence about his faith were as damaging to Democrats as homosexuality and abortion . <P> But blaming Kerry avoids the real dilemma . The Democrats have lost a good slice of less educated , less wealthy white Protestant and Catholic voters . Their economic issues are not nearly as compelling as the Republicans ' religious appeal . There is a good reason for that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reality oft cited by Democrats and ignored by Republicans : the middle-class squeeze . Most " values " voters are the " average " folks John Edwards was talking about throughout the campaign : Mom and Dad both working , spending less time with their kids and falling behind economically . The Democrats address only the economic part of the equation . But most peoplerightlydo not believe that a President can do much to stem the outflow of manufacturing jobs . Universal health care seems a pipe dream too . Indeed , Kerry 's offering a $1,000 reduction in health-care premiums and a $4,000 tuition tax credit while he also promised to cut the budget deficit sounded like political flimflam . <P> George W. Bush promised practically nothing except faith and strength . But religious faith is the implicit Republican solution to the personal traumas of the middle-class squeezethe fact that overworked parents are scared to death that their unsupervised kids are taking life lessons from the sex , drugs and weirdness spewing from their televisions and computers . Liberals scoff , but the balm that comes with being part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choirs and , yes , the moral absolutes that often accompany such communionis real and comforting , unlike the promise of complicated and expensive government programs .
