" This is going to be the snowstorm of the century , " the action reporter , Brad Dayton , cried with a certain hysterical glee . Clad in bright yellow foul weather gear , he was standing on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike . Cars were inching by , sliding and spinning , as a gusty wind blew wet snow in every direction . The flakes seemed to target the reporter 's face and the lens of the television camera . The sky was thick with gray clouds , and the whole Northeast was hunkering down for an unexpected blizzard . " Do n't go anywhere , " he cried as he blinked to avoid the pelting precipitation . " Stay home . And forget the airports . They 're closed , and it looks like they wo n't reopen for several days . " Regan Reilly stared at the television in her cozy Los Angeles office in an ancient building on Hollywood Boulevard . " I ca n't believe it , " she said aloud . " I should have flown out yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged the cable news anchor in the climate-controlled studio . " Try to stay dry . " " I will , " Brad shouted over the shrill wind . He started to say something else , but the sound was knocked out . The news director cut quickly to a weatherman standing in front of a map with lots of ominous arrows pointing in all directions . " What have you got for us , Larry ? " the smiling blond anchorwoman asked . " Snow coming from all directions , " Larry explained urgently as his hands made circles around the map . " Snow , snow , and more snow . I hope you all have lots of canned goods at home because this storm is going to stay with us for the next several days , and it is packing a wallop ! " Regan looked out the window . It was a typically sunny day in Los Angeles . Her suitcase was packed for New York . Recently engaged , Regan was a thirty-one-year-old private investigator based in Los Angeles . Her honey , Jack " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case squad in New York City . They were to wed in May , and she had been planning to fly out for the weekend to see Jack and her parents , Luke and Nora , who lived in Summit , New Jersey . Regan and her mother were supposed to meet with a wedding coordinator on Saturday to review all the plans for the big day  --  menu , flowers , limos , photographer , the list went on and on . On Saturday night she and her parents and Jack had arranged to hear a band they were considering for the reception . Regan had been looking forward to a fun night out . The snowstorm would have precluded those plans , but if Regan had gotten to New York yesterday , she could have had a cozy weekend with Jack . It was the second week in January , and she had n't seen him for ten days . And what 's more romantic than being together during a snowstorm ? She felt lonely and frustrated , and the sight of the shining sun she found irritating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to be in New York . The phone rang . " Regan Reilly , " she answered without much enthusiasm . " Aloha , Regan . It 's your maid of honor calling from Hawaii . " Kit Callan was Regan 's best friend . They 'd met in college on a junior year abroad program in England . Kit lived in Hartford and sold insurance . Her other job was the hunt for Mr. Right . So far she was having better luck peddling her policies . " Aloha , Kit . " Regan smiled and immediately felt better just hearing her best friend 's voice . She knew that Kit had gone to Hawaii for an insurance convention . " How 's your trip going ? " " I 'm stuck here . " " Not many people would complain that they were stuck in Hawaii . " " The convention ended Tuesday . I took an extra day to relax , and now I ca n't get home . My travel agent says you ca n't get anywhere near the East Coast . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York today to see Jack . And my mother and I were going to meet with the wedding planner . " " Promise me you 'll go easy on me with the bridesmaids ' dresses . " " I was actually thinking of plaid pantsuits , " Regan quipped . " I 've got an idea . Come out here , and we 'll pick up some grass skirts . " Regan laughed . " Now there 's an idea . People always want their weddings to be different . " " So you 're coming then ? " " What are you talking about ? " " Get out here , Regan ! How many chances will we have to be together like this again ? Once you get hitched , that 'll be it . You 'll never want to leave him , and I do n't blame you . " " I 'm keeping my office in Los Angeles , " Regan protested . " At least for a while . " " That 's different . You know what I mean . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend before your wedding . What else are you going to do for the next few days ? Watch the weather reports ? Come out here to Waikiki . I 'll have a tropical drink waiting for you . I have a room on the second floor with two big beds and a balcony overlooking the ocean . You can almost dip your toes into the sand from here . As a matter of fact , I 'm sitting on the balcony right now waiting for room service to deliver my breakfast . " " Be careful . With the sound of the waves crashing , you might not hear them knock , " Regan muttered as she looked around the office that had been her home away from home for several years . The antique desk she 'd found at a flea market , the black-and-white-tiled floor , the coffeepot in its place of honor atop a filing cabinet were all so familiar . But now they did n't feel welcoming . She had cleared the decks for a weekend away and felt the need to get out and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit much in the year since she 'd met Jack . " Where are you staying ? " Regan asked . " The Waikiki Waters Playground and Resort . " " That 's a mouthful . " " You should see this place . It was just renovated , so everything is brand-new and beautiful . There are restaurants , shops , two spas , five pools , and several towers of rooms . We 're in the best tower right on the water . And there 's a gala charity ball this Saturday night . They 're auctioning off a shell lei that belonged to a princess from the royal family . They 're calling it the ' Be a Princess ' Ball . So come on out . We 'll both be princesses . " Kit paused . " What 's going on down there ? " she said softly , more to herself than Regan . " What are you talking about ? " Regan asked . Kit did n't seem to hear her . " I do n't believe it , " she said with alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's going on ? " " People are suddenly running down to the water 's edge . I think a body just washed ashore ! " " Are you kidding ? " " A woman just tore out of the water screaming her head off . It looks like she came across the body when she was out for a swim . " " Oh , my God . " " Regan , you 're not going to let me stay by myself here this weekend , are you ? " Kit inquired meekly . " This place could be dangerous . " " I 'll call the airlines .
