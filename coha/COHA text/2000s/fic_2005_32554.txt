72 Hour Hold By Bebe Moore Campbell Random House Bebe Moore Campbell Right before the devastation , I had a good day . God should have pulled my coattail then and there : " Enjoy this while you can , honey , because Satan beat me in a poker game last night , and he 's claiming you and yours sometime soon . " After all the praying and tithing I 've done , I deserved a heads-up . Damn . Whatever happened to sending a sign ? Lean cow , fat cow . Burning bush . Dove with an olive branch . Yoo-hoo ! Something . It was probably better that the events evolved with no foreshadowing . Preparation was n't possible . And what difference would it have made anyhow ? Knowing that the hounds are tracking you does n't mean you wo n't get caught ; it means you have to get to the swamp fast . So there I was , clueless : lolling in the bed , stretching my legs and my toes -- which needed a pedicure -- ticking off a list of things to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the second Saturday in April . Sunshine was making its way through a thick haze . Rising up , I stared out of my bedroom window , squinting a bit as I tried to discern the LA skyline , framed neatly between the two huge palm trees in my backyard . Thick pea soup almost obliterated the view , but I did n't look away until I sighted those buildings . Once I knew the city had survived the night , my shoulders came down . Anything can happen at any time in an earthquake zone , and I 've learned to take nothing for granted . I 've gone to bed some evenings only to awaken at dawn to broken windows and cracked dishes . That the Bank of America and Wells Fargo headquarters had n't been shaken and dashed into oblivion during the night meant I had survived as well . I 'm always grateful for a morning with no tremors , no frantic dogs barking . Trina was beside me , not a heartbeat away , her hip pressed into my thigh . She felt warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day after her eighteenth birthday , when most girls were declaring their independence , my daughter was still creeping into my bed . Even when she hated me , she wanted to be close . She was still fresh from last night 's bath and smelled like Dove and that pale yellow lotion in the big plastic bottle . That staple of American vanities and kitchen counters promises to banish dry skin forever but ca n't even begin to handle seriously crusty feet . My grandmother 's feet at the end of February would have had that lotion begging for mercy . But then , when you grow up plowing Georgia clay barefoot in the hard times , nothing on or in you remains soft . For Trina 's smooth , buttery skin , that watery lotion worked just fine . The toes pressed against my calves were just as supple as the rest of her and just as lovely . Gazing at my sleeping daughter , I could take her in without annoying her . Such a pretty child , I thought . There was n't a blemish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , I was lulled by the well-wishing smiles of strangers who were bewitched by the dazzling enormity of her round eyes and endless smile , her marble-sized dimples and naturally sandy hair . Trina seemed to take the attention in stride , but it inflated me . My gingerbread-brown face was symmetrical , with two eyes placed where eyes should be , lips that were n't full or thin , a nose that would keep me alive , hair that was thick and strong but otherwise unremarkable . Nobody turned to stare at me when I walked down the street , not the way they did with Trina . I used to think of her beauty as an insurance policy that would guarantee her a perfect life . A lot of people who are n't beautiful think this way . It was six o'clock , and I had a standing appointment with the treadmill and some free weights . Trina stirred , then turned over and stared at me . " Hey , grown woman , " I said , teasing . " My back hurts , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arched her body , then settled herself beneath the covers . This was a setup , and we both knew it . " Well , you should get on the floor and do those exercises I showed you . That will get the kinks out . " " Aww , Mommeee ! " she wailed , fully awake . " Aw , Mommy , what ? " " Ca n't you rub it just a little bit ? " I felt a twinge of annoyance . She knew I worked out every morning . " Turn over . " Her motion was languid , a movement befitting the idle rich . I leaned over my daughter and began kneading her back and shoulders . There were no knots of tension anywhere . She became limp beneath my fingers . In a few minutes she was asleep again . Downstairs in my kitchen , I stopped to get a bottle of water before going into the small gym located next to the garage . Thirty minutes on the treadmill at five miles per hour , followed by fifteen minutes of lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my routine . I 've always been into fitness . I opened the windows , turned on loud salsa music , and began my workout . By the time I had finished running in place , my forehead was dripping and my clothes were damp . I reached for the free weights , lifting and lowering , extending and holding , until my biceps were ready to secede from the rest of my body . I forced myself to do two hundred sit-ups and fifty leg thrusts , panting and sweating like a beagle on crack . Forty push-ups to go . I counted from one to ten , then ten to one , then twenty to one . Shrink the challenge -- my way of psyching myself out . All my muscles seemed to be bursting when I finally began stretching . Time for euphoria . I did it ! " Let 's go somewhere , Mommee , " Trina said when I returned to the bedroom . She had n't moved from the spot where I 'd left her . " Like where ? " Trina paused for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun with her first request being granted -- that her every bidding would be honored . " Let 's go downtown and get some flowers . " Her voice was childlike , with a smooth , unperturbed lilt , a tone that made her sound so vulnerable . This eight-year-old voice gave me reason to pause , to ponder . She had n't sounded like that in a long time . Trina was incapable of moving fast in the morning . If prodded , she turned first irritable and then insufferable . I , on the other hand , dressed quickly . But then my uniform for Saturdays was easy : sweats and sneakers , no makeup , no hairdo , totally unlike my fashion-plate weekday attire . I glanced in the mirror in my bathroom ; my mother stared back at me . Impossible to escape her : same eyes , same mouth and smile , same cheekbones . I closed my eyes and untied the silk scarf that held my short bob in place . Two strokes of the comb , a few little flips with my fingers , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumping around inside her room , opening and slamming drawers . She was her own personal tornado ; the mess she 'd leave behind her when she finally descended would be a viable submission for a Guinness record . She had on both the television and the radio . Hoping she would n't take forever , I made breakfast , cleaning up and putting things away as I cooked . The birthday cake I 'd baked was still on the counter , the eighteen candles intact . The stove , floor , and sink were spotless . If I could n't control my child , at least I was in charge of my kitchen . When she was finally dressed , Trina bounded down the stairs like an exuberant puppy . " You fixed breakfast . Yummy . " There it was again , the baby voice . I made breakfast most days , not that I 'm such a little Betty Crocker but because Trina had to eat well . We sat at the kitchen table and gobbled up the nonfat bran muffins , scrambled eggs , and oatmeal I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange juice for Trina . Taking the plates to the sink to scrape them , I could see Trina from the corner of my eye , stealing a sip from my cup . My shoulders tightened , inched upward . Trina was n't supposed to have caffeine . But then she reached for the small bottle of pink pills that was between the salt and pepper shakers . She shook out one , placed it carefully in her mouth , and swallowed it with the hot liquid . For the last three or four months I had n't had to remind her . She took another sip of coffee and then several more . Maybe she was having trouble swallowing the pill . " You do n't have to keep staring at me , " she said , when I sat back down . " I ca n't look at my own gorgeous child ? " I always tried to stop myself from watching Trina , or at least being caught at it . " I know what I have to do . I want to go to school in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some days that was true . Crenshaw Boulevard was just beginning to open its eyes as we made our way down from the hills of View Park , the quiet neighborhood that looms above the usually bustling business district . It was just after eight o'clock and the mall was still closed , of course , as were most of the stores that lined the street . But the small army of hucksters whose domain was the block just north of Slauson Boulevard had already queued up . Their wares were arranged neatly on tables near the backs of their vans or on portable shelves that were as close to the oncoming traffic as was legally possible . Or illegally possible . CDs , tapes , African garb , a few food items , some household products , and clothing were for sale , as well as the occasional bootlegged video . " Pssst . Got that new Chris Rock , right here . Gim me five . " The most colorful items were the T-shirts and caps hanging from the chain-link fence that surrounded a vacant lot and served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no hordes walking along Crenshaw . Customers had to be hunted , then captured . Several salesmen waded into traffic , vigorously waving their goods . I beeped my horn as I passed Fish Man , a portly gentleman who sold fresh salmon from the back of a white van at prices that were far lower than at the grocery store . A few feet away Mr. Bean Pie , representing the capitalistic interests of the Nation of Islam , clad in the requisite suit and bow tie , hawked newspapers and mouth-watering pies created from the lowly navy bean to drivers stopped at the red light . Beyond the bakery section , young men were approaching idling cars , holding up T-shirts , caps , and all manner of Lakers regalia , not to mention American flags in every size , for every conceivable place . I whizzed by them . I had a flag sticking in my lawn and one on my car and no longer braked for Old Glory . The last enterprise zone belonged to Crenshaw 's most ubiquitous sales force : the Incense People . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Laundromats and beauty parlors , slouch against the exterior walls of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts , Rite Aid , and Savon Drugs , waving their wares and chanting " Buy some incense " to anyone who ventured close enough to be considered a possible sale . Based on the sheer size of the IP workforce , it was a wonder that a mushroom cloud was n't hovering over South Central at all times . Either we were the dope-smokingest folks in the city or we were meditating around the clock . Maybe both . Several young men were eyeing my car , their fists dangling the telltale plastic bags , but fortunately the light was green . Among the legions of hucksters , the IP were the risk takers and had been known to jump in front of moving vehicles , defying death and dismemberment for the sale of a one-dollar bag . Half a block away , Crazy Man was standing near one of the IP . Some of my neighbors referred to him that way , and even though I , of all people , should have known better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he appeared to have schizophrenia but seemed harmless . According to some neighbors , he had been normal until he came back from Vietnam . Others swore his troubles began during high school . Crazy Man trekked in and around the community all day long , returning at night to his mother 's house . His hair was a matted clump that had n't seen shampoo , comb , brush , or scissors in a decade . He was clad in ancient dirty pants and a ragged shirt . His feet were bare and filthy . It would take heavy-duty equipment to get him clean . That and a crew . If mania and hallucinations , delusions , and paranoia have an odor , then that 's what was rising out of his pores . Maybe pain , loss , and fury too . The light ahead of me flashed yellow , and I sped up to get across the street . Just as I pressed down on the gas , I heard " Trina ! Keri ! "  - -  a loud , exuberant yell . Trina turned around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in the car next to us was waving and shouting . " Mom , that 's PJ . Yo , PJ , whazzup ? " Trina screamed out the window . I waved . My ex-boyfriend 's son was one of my favorite people , and I had n't seen him in the months since I 'd broken up with his dad . " Thanks for the cash ! " he yelled as his car sped away . When I caught a glimpse of him , he was n't smiling . Sometimes he looked so sad to me . " You 're welcome ! " I hollered back , then chuckled . Only two weeks earlier I 'd stuck three twenties into a birthday card and mailed it to him . I craned my neck to get a better look at PJ , and at that moment Crazy Man stepped off the sidewalk against the light , directly in my path . There was no time to stop . To my right was an SUV ; a man was driving and there were children in the back . Another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . If I braked and then aimed toward the median , maybe the concrete riser would slow me down enough for him to get out of the way . It was my only option . When my front tires hit the concrete , the huckster jumped back and his incense went flying into the air , along with some hand picked words for me . I froze momentarily , grateful that the move I 'd executed had been successful , then caught my breath , put the car in reverse , and backed up into my lane . Around me horns blared as I put my car in drive and continued forward , feeling a surge of rage as I passed Crazy Man . His face was placid as he stared vacantly straight ahead , seemingly unaware that he 'd ever been in any danger . " What 's up with that stupid fool ? " Trina asked . " Not thinking , I guess . " " Dag . " She brightened . " Did you see PJ ? " She started laughing . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mustache . " She giggled again . " Does he really ? " I always thought of PJ as my little boy , which of course he was n't . Trina and I had been going to the flower district since we first moved to LA from Atlanta , nearly ten years earlier .
