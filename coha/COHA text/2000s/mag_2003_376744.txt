Long before anyone had ever heard of Miss Manners , Titus Maccius Plautus discerned the truth about hospitality . " No guest is so welcome in a friend 's house that he will not become a nuisance after three days , " wrote ancient Rome 's great playwright . With the holiday-travel season upon us , there are ample opportunities to annoy friends and family with burdensome visits . For that reason , TIME checked in with two experts , Letitia Baldrige and Peter Post  --  both out with new etiquette books  --  for advice on how to be a well-mannered houseguest . <P> The truth about most of us is that we carefully plan our holiday entertaining but give little forethought to our visits . That 's a big mistake , say the experts . Plan ahead to be a good guest , especially during the holidays . " Christmas can mean total chaos ; to have a guest stay in the middle of it is really tough , " says Baldrige , author of New Manners for New Times ( Scribner ; 709 pages ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long your stay will be and what type of activities you plan to do . <P> Whether your hosts are relatives or friends , a house gift is a requirement . Do you need to show up with it ? " That 's the ideal , " says Post , author of Essential Manners for Men : What to Do , When to Do It and Why ( HarperCollins ; 200 pages ) . " When you arrive at the door and you 're all saying your hellos , you say , ' I really want to let you know how much I appreciate being here , ' and you hand them a gift . That 's a really nice way to start off on the right foot . " The magnitude of the gift depends on the length of your stay , the size of your entourage and your financial situation . Be a little creative , says Baldrige : " You just ca n't call up and get the fruitcake of the month or something like that .

" <P> Your behavior during your stay will be long remembered , so mind your manners . Says Post : " You 're entering somebody else 's home , a place with its own set of rules , its own culture . It 's important for you to take part in that world and to accept its ways . " Plan to take good care of the spaces you will occupy  --  the bedroom , the bathroom , the kitchen . Both experts advise that you offer your help with the activities around you . Can you shovel the snow ? Help with the cooking ? Buy some groceries ? Walk the dog ? At least make a sincere offer ! <P> If you 're visiting parents with your significant other , accept the sleeping arrangements that are provided , say the experts . " Do n't fight your parents if they put you in separate rooms , " says Baldrige . <P> If you are a parent visiting with kids in tow , lay down the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post , " review with your kids the basics of being in someone else 's home : saying hello , shaking hands , looking people in the eye , watching your manners , not running wild and eating what 's in front of you . " Says Baldrige : " Do n't take your children with you unless you have well-behaved children . When you say , ' You have to go to bed now , ' that child has to go to bed and get out of the way .
