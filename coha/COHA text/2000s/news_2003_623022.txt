<p> Sharmeen Obaid had a really good story . What she needed was a really good resume . <p> A native of Pakistan , the 24-year-old Stanford graduate student wanted to visit a refugee camp near the border of Afghanistan and film children who were fighting for survival after U.S. bombings laid their country to waste . <p> " I literally sent out proposal letters to a hundred different places , " said Obaid , who had never made a documentary . " I sent it to places as far-flung as MTV . I just sent it to everyone . " <p> After dozens of rejections , New York Times Television last year decided to take a chance with the Muslim student . The result , " Terror 's Children , " will be broadcast March 25 as a cornerstone of the first day of programming for the fledgling Discovery Times Channel . <p> Obaid 's documentary is compelling and revealing , focusing on seven children  --  including a carpet weaver and a garbage picker  --  and their sometimes stark opinions of America . At one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hijack an airplane to do harm to the United States . <p> But her journey to get the documentary funded , edited and broadcast is a story in its own right . <p> When Obaid started pitching " Terror 's Children , " she had little more than an idea and needed thousands of dollars to get the project going . She had written articles about Pakistan for a Canadian newspaper , but had never worked on a film . <p> Obaid received money from her undergraduate university , Smith College , but it was n't enough . She finally received an e-mail response from New York Times Television president William Abrams . <p> Abrams arranged a meeting in New York , and Obaid 's display of photos , the children 's biographies and her youthful assertiveness were impossible to turn down . <p> " I 've never in my life hired somebody sight unseen with very minimal television skills and handed them some money to take off to a ( foreign country ) and shoot the story , " Abrams said . " Usually , we have everything figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to air the show . " <p> Abrams met with Obaid and agreed to give her $10,000 . The TV production company trained her to use the camera , and Abrams held his breath as she flew to Pakistan to start the documentary . <p> The documentary is a very personal account , about a woman 's return to a homeland that has changed drastically in the past decade . Obaid was helped by Mohammed Naqvi , an American student who had experience in film and ultimately co-produced " Terror 's Children . " <p> Obaid grew up in Pakistan in a relatively affluent home in Karachi . She experienced culture shock in the refugee camps , comparing herself to a Manhattan resident who had never visited the Bronx . <p> " I grew up with a very modern outlook . I wore Western clothes at home . I went to coed school . I did everything that a normal , average , not insane American kid would do , " Obaid said . " I went to the parties . I did it all . " <p> Obaid said her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first woman in her family to go to college and to be sent to the United States for further education . <p> Her father was n't thrilled that his daughter wanted to spend the summer of 2002 at the volatile border . <p> " My dad was like , ' Are you mad ? What is wrong with you ? ' " Obaid said . " After the fourth week , my parents got me bodyguards . At one point , I had four or five people with guns who would keep their safe distance from me . " <p> No shots were fired , but there was plenty of drama . Obaid covered her head but refused to cover her face , which is the custom of Afghan women in the region . <p> She was shouted at and surrounded by angry men several times  --  at one point the rear window of her crew 's car was shattered  --  but she did n't back down . <p> " I just got as loud and abrasive as them , " Obaid said , recalling one confrontation . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should leave . If they did n't appreciate seeing a woman without her face covered , then they should go somewhere else . That did n't settle too well . " <p> Back home , New York Times Television executives waited for the first tapes to arrive by mail . <p> Obaid was n't a U.S. citizen . Theoretically , she could have cashed the check , gone to Pakistan and never returned . ( " They did n't know anything about me , " she said . " They did n't even know my Social Security number when they wrote the check out to me . " ) <p> Abrams said when the first tape arrived , he knew his risk had paid off . Obaid was a natural . <p> " She went off and did a fantastic job , " he said . " She was able to gain people 's trust . She knew her way around . This was only a couple of months after ( journalist ) Daniel Pearl was killed . I was very nervous about doing anything in Pakistan . " <p> Obaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan , and would have paid it back if the tapes were n't usable . <p> " I took the chance and they took the chance , " Obaid said . " I remember Bill Abrams telling me , ' You can take the money and run away to Pakistan , and we 'll never be able to trace you . ' " <p> Obaid said she often broke into tears in the middle of interviews , but kept in mind who she was working for . She did n't give the children anything while she was working , but after the filming was completed , she returned with a car full of toys and clothes . <p> The documentarian currently has no direct contact with the children , but gets e-mailed accounts about them from a translator she worked with in Pakistan . <p> The hourlong film was completed only a few weeks ago , with Obaid 's voice-over recorded last . With a slightly longer resume now and with funding a little easier to come by , she 's considering other projects while getting ready to start a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While young journalists like Obaid have had an impossible time getting funding in the past , the Discovery Times Channel offers a new marketplace . <p> The channel 's general manager , Vivian Schiller , said there are plenty of news shows and historical documentaries on cable , but not enough programming that puts recent history into perspective . <p> " That is our goal . We want to find fresh voices that are out there that maybe are n't getting heard , " Schiller said . " Not the pundits , but the people who have stories to tell and have a unique perspective . People who have a voice and have the access and can bring these stories to life . " <p> Discovery Times Network , available in the Bay Area on digital cable and satellite , will mix original documentaries and programs with some older ones . Author Peter Bergen is also premiering a documentary , called " Al Qaeda 2.0 " on March 25 . <p> Schiller said the combination of the work of an experienced veteran and a newcomer will give viewers an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As important as it is to have credentialed experts , it 's also important to find smart people who have the proper journalistic values who have n't been heard from before , " she said . <p> Obaid acknowledges that she once hoped the documentary would get broader exposure . But she realizes that a major network might have forced her to focus on the refugee camps as terrorist training grounds , instead of the lives of the children . <p> " Discovery Times Channel gave me the freedom to tell my story , " Obaid said . " That 's what I really wanted at the end of the day . " <p> ' TERROR 'S CHILDREN ' <p>  --  The documentary will be broadcast at 9 p.m . March 25 on the Discovery Times Channel . <p> E-mail Peter Hartlaub at **25;10045;TOOLONG
