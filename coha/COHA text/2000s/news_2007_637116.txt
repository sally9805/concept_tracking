<p> Editor 's note : This is another installment in an occasional series of essays by Atlanta-born Cpl . John Matthew Bishop , a Marine who is serving his second tour of duty in Iraq . For operational security reasons , the exact location of his unit can not be revealed . <p> Northern Iraq  --  As our C-130 cargo plane touches down , I check my watch . Local time here is 0900 hours , which lost track already . <p> Oddly , while I can hear in my mind the bass-thumping , horn-blowing traffic crawling through the Atlanta nightscape thousands of miles away , somehow the country in which we 've just landed does n't register as very near or very real at all . It almost seems absurd that in a few seconds our plane 's cargo bay will open with a loud , hydraulic yawn and disgorge us onto the most frequently mortared base in Iraq . <p> But as I step outside and my boots land on Iraqi soil , I 'm in the desert again , and the simple , dull scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transporting me thousands of hours , thousands of miles in a split-second . Next to me , my favorite sergeant  --  the best Marine I know  --  peers out over the sand , his expression , as usual , an inscrutable mask . This is his fourth tour . " We 're back ! " I yell at him over the roar of the C-130 's propellers . He nods . " Feels like coming home , does n't it ? " <p> And strangely enough , it does . I 've known this moment would come since I got back from my first tour nearly a year ago . In the interim , memories of this place have stolen into every part of my life , shadowing me during my morning runs and waiting under my pillow each night . And joining them , sired by the passage of time , a fresh brood of expectations and uncertainties have shaped this place anew in my imagination . For months , I 've wondered if our area would be improved , if we 'd still receive a smile now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For now , it feels as if we never left . Perhaps it 's because stepping into most parts of Iraq is like stepping into some cosmic time-lapse . The unchanging , daily sunbake , the pristinely barren stretches of sand in every direction , the mosques ' five daily calls to prayer : Each day is like the one before it , like the ones 500 years before it . Time begins to seem as it actually is  --  an everlasting parade of the present . Paradoxically , we come to feel at home here , for what is home if not a feeling of stillness , a sanctuary of constancy in the midst of the flux and chaos outside the front door ? <p> Over the next weeks , the Marines will slowly begin to look more and more at home here . Accustomed to jeans and polo shirts , many  --  especially gunners , who are exposed to excessive amounts of dust and sun  --  will don shemagh , the Arab headdress that covers one 's neck , face and scalp . Many will grow mustaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as boys . They 'll learn on their patrols how to interact with Arabs and grow surprisingly skillful at communicating in Arabic . Many of those returning for a second , third or fourth tour have already had tattoos inked in Arabic script . There 's something graceful , even beautiful in how naturally the sons of America shape-shift and adapt into sons of the desert . <p> Most , if asked , would probably describe Iraq in terms unfit for public discourse . But this place , albeit inhospitable , has its own ascetic , almost monastic voice . In the absence of the collective psychological noise that seems to have reached a maddening crescendo in Western postmodernity , one ironically feels as if , in stepping into the wasteland , one were stepping clear of an endless , invisible bombardment . <p> For example , I remember doing surveillance one night on an extremely remote village . Like most villages of its size and remove , it consisted of a smattering of simple , one-room mud huts and livestock pens . The surveillance was routine  --  more to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any perceived threat from this group of shepherds . Our approach undetected , we fanned out and took our positions , silently observing the village 's only activity : a few families sitting around an open-air fire . Occasionally they erupted into laughter  --  over what , we did not know , perhaps could not know . Seldom have I witnessed much Iraqi cheer . These simple people  --  their halo of laughter and light like a miniature world in the midst of the dark desert of the universe  --  must have understood life in a completely different way than us . <p> Normally , per our standard operating procedures , we would have questioned them following this period of observation . But when our patrol leader 's voice came over the headset , he simply instructed us to maintain concealment as we egressed . <p> When we rallied back at our vehicles , the prevailing mood was thoughtful . A few of the Marines affirmed they were glad to have skipped the questioning ; we were coming back the next day , anyway , and could make our inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers , we all knew the confusion and concern that would have resulted . It was then , looking around at my comrades , that I understood that they had all felt , in their own way , what I had felt . I could n't quite put my finger on it , but something had spoken , and paradoxically , it was only in this place of ubiquitous squalor and violence that it could be clearly heard . <p> As I settle here for the second time , I wonder whether this place is such a paradox , or whether I am simply seeing , as in a mirror , the paradox we 've brought here with us . Living in relative peace and prosperity , have we Americans not matured into postmodernity somehow fundamentally malnourished ? <p> I turn these questions over in my mind now , and something funny keeps reoccurring to me , as if it were suggesting itself as an answer . Last night I woke up and could n't go back to sleep . Walking outside to get some air , I saw a Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had fallen asleep on it , I went to wake him up so he could go to bed . He was n't asleep , though  --  he was actually just lying on his back , looking at the sky through his night-vision goggles . When I asked him what he was doing , he laughed and explained that when viewed through the light-amplifying NVGs , even the faintest stars became bright . He was from Boston and had never seen so many . <p> If we 've missed something , perhaps it 's because we have n't looked up often enough . <p> THE JOHN MATTHEW BISHOP FILE <p> Military rank : Corporal <p> Military branch : U.S. Marine Corps <p> Military occupational specialty : 0331 , Machine-gunner <p> Current duty station : Camp Lejeune , N.C. <p> Theater of operations : Northern Iraq <p> Birthdate : Aug. 9 , 1981 <p> Birthplace : Northside Hospital , Atlanta <p> Age : 25 <p> Education : North Gwinnett High School , 1996-1999 , University of Georgia 1999-2004 ( A.B.-English ) <p> Contact : Bishop@desertpen.com Photo : Courtesy of John BishopMarines from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bomb-plagued stretch of road in northern Iraq. /ImageData*
