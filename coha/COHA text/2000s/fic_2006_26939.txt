Chapter One Never Kiss Your Mom in Public My name is A.J. and I hate school . Do you know which is the worst day of the week ? If you ask me , it 's Monday . Because Monday is the start of five days of school in a row . That 's horrible ! Tuesday and Wednesday are n't so great either . Thursday is a pretty good day , because then we only have one day of school left before the weekend . Friday is really good , because that 's when the school week is over . But the best day of the week is Saturday . I play peewee football on Saturday , and we do n't have school again for two whole days . Too bad it was Monday morning . I was waiting in front of my house for the school bus with my mom . " You be a good boy , A.J. , " my mom told me . " I will . " " Do n't get into any trouble , A.J. , " my mom told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise your hand when you want to talk , A.J. , " my mom told me . " Do n't shoot straw wrappers at the girls , A.J. , " my mom told me . " I wo n't . " My mom told me about a million hundred other things I was n't allowed to do until I saw the yellow school bus coming around the corner . " Mom , I promise not to have any fun at all , " I said . " Bye ! " The bus pulled up . Mrs. Kormel , the bus driver , pushed a button and made the little stop sign pop out the side of the bus so the cars on the street will stop . We call it the magic stop sign . That thing is cool . " Give Mommy a kiss , A.J. " No way I was going to kiss my mother in front of all the kids staring out the bus window . That 's the first rule of being a kid . Do n't ever kiss your mother when other kids are watching ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for school , Mom . " " Give Mommy a kiss , A.J. " " That 's not gon na happen , Mom . " " Give Mommy a kiss , A.J. " " Over my dead body , Mom . " " Give Mommy a kiss , A.J. " " I will if you give me a hundred dollars , Mom , " I said . My mother tried to wrap her arms around me , but I know how to get away from tacklers . When Mom went to grab me , I threw her a head fake , spun away , and gave her a few of my best fancy footwork moves that I learned playing peewee football . She did n't have a chance ! I sidestepped her and ran on the bus before she could hug or kiss me . Ha-ha-ha ! My mom ca n't play football for beans . Nah-nah-nah boo-boo on her ! Continues ...
