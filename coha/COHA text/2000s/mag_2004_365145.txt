The Scissor Sisters are an American band , but their self-titled debut album came out in Europe almost six months before its arrival in the U.S. Why the delay ? You get the feeling that the Scissor Sisters ' record company , Universal , was a little nervous about how audiences Stateside might react to these five flamboyant New Yorkers . Never mind that the band 's name was inspired by a lesbian sexual position or that lead singer Jake Shears used to perform in drag shows going by a name in excruciatingly bad taste . The Scissor Sisters are the first band in the history of the world to cite Supertramp as a profound artistic influence . They 're pushing the bounds of tolerance . <P> They are also the most enjoyable pop group to emerge in recent memory , largely because they understand the genre so well . Pop music  --  where the same three chords have been swapping clothes for the past 50 years  --  is the nexus of the avant-garde and the conventional , and on their debut , out ( finally ) July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ana Matronic , Paddy Boom and Del Marquis  --  walk the line with Madonna-like confidence . Take Your Mama , their first single , is about getting Mom drunk on cheap champagne so you can come out of the closet to her while going clubbing with friends . Yet as Shears vaults his falsetto over lines like " You can stay up late ' cause baby you 're a full-grown man " and into solidly gay territory , the rest of the band pillages comfortable Top 40 riffs from George Michael 's Faith , Billy Joel 's Piano Man and anything Elton John did n't bolt to the floor . Take Your Mama feels familiar enough to dance to and new enough to keep you riveted . It 's an excellent pop song . <P> The entire first half of Scissor Sisters is nearly flawless , and impressively diverse too . There 's an exuberant dance cover of Pink Floyd 's Comfortably Numb that sounds like New Order fronted by Andy Gibb . Tits on the Radio is a disco-funk rant about the cultural sterilization of New York City . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deja vu is Shears . As he struts his way through the material , he radiates a completely original kind of magnetism . He 's sexual , commanding and totally goofy  --  like a man who ca n't believe his hairbrush and mirror have actually turned into a microphone and a crowd . <P> The Scissor Sisters still have a few things to work on . The production is less than imaginative , and the album is heavily front-loaded ; the last 20 minutes sag . The band generates so much goodwill , though , that it 's hard to hold much against them . But they still do n't get a pass on Supertramp.  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
