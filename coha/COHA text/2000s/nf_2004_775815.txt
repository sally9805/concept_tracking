The story of paper moon reflects my childhood , but it also closely parallels my mother 's and strangely foreshadows my daughter 's . Three generations of women : we all lost our mothers early in life - the first literally , to death ; the second virtually , to addiction ; and the third , my daughter , temporarily , when I succumbed to familiar demons . It is a cycle that I 'm determined to break . // My mother was born , like Addie , in the heart of the Great Depression , not in Kansas but in Americus , Georgia . The elder of two daughters of Henry and Dorothy English Cook , she was named for her mother but later christened herself Joanna . A letter from her cousin Libba that I discovered after her death depicts her early childhood as cozy : rocking on the old porch swing , sitting by the potbellied stove , sliding down the banister at her grandmother's. // She was the only one not in the car when her father swerved off the road because her mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embankment into a ravine . Both her mother and her baby sister , Virginia , died instantly . Libba 's letter recalls , in haunting detail , how she got the news : " We were on the playground .... My ma had come to school . // You had all visited the day before . And Momma kept saying , ' The pillow I put in my stroller for the baby to sit in had an imprint of the little body in it . ' " Henry , my mother 's father , was badly hurt but lingered for a year before dying of a ruptured spleen-or , she always believed , of a broken heart . So , at age six , my mother became an orphan . For a time she was farmed out to live with her maternal grandmother , who was confined to a wheelchair with an osteoporosis-like condition . She was also addicted to morphine , prescribed by the town doctor , making her the first known link in my family 's chain of drug dependence . Even in that environment , my mother managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million-dollar smile , and so talented at singing and playing the piano that she became a star at church . By the time my mother reached her early teens , however , her grandmother had grown too feeble and impoverished to raise her . She was adopted by a wealthy local family , who saw her through high school then sent her off to Agnes Scott College near Atlanta , which was one of the top women 's schools in the South . I 've heard rumors that she was molested by a member of her adoptive family , but my mother never spoke of it . She rarely mentioned her teenage marriage to Willis Moore , of which her lifelong last name was the only trace . Southern women of her era were bred to smooth over unpleasantness , but denial in my mother ran as deep as her love for amphetamines . So I came to know her through a scrim of pictures and letters , lies and secrets . // She was extraordinarily beautiful , with blond hair , a perfect heart-shaped face , huge green eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seductive voice ( which Emily and I both inherited ) warmed by her southern lilt . Winning a beauty contest brought my mother to Hollywood in the mid-1950s , where she was discovered at a cocktail party and signed to Universal . A flood of contract assignments followed , in films ranging from such minor classics as The Last Angry Man and Walk on the Wild Side to teen screamers like Monster on Campus . Among them was A Touch of Evil , the last Hollywood film directed by Orson Welles , which has been hailed as " the greatest B movie ever made . " It opens with one of the most famous shots in movie history-nearly three and a half minutes long-tracking a car with a bomb in its trunk through a seedy Mexican border town . Finally the car explodes , killing the driver ; and a corrupt , drunken sheriff ( played by Orson Welles ) tries to pin the crime on bystanders Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh . Though my mother is on screen only for a short time in the film , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that my mother was the best actor in the family , but it was only after she died that I came to recognize her power . // In A Touch of Evil my mother had to darken her hair to avoid out-blonding Janet Leigh . After hours , she had to dodge Charlton Heston , who once lured her to his room , seemingly to seduce her . Later Elvis Presley hit on her with even less finesse . While making Follow That Dream in 1962 , he actually tried to break down her door . But my mother had no use for the idol of millions of teenagers , telling an interviewer , " He 's a bore . " // After the mid-1960s , she worked mainly in television . She was featured in most of the major series of the day : Gunsmoke , The Rifleman , Bat Masterson , Wagon Train , Maverick , and The Virginian-westerns dominated the top twenty - as well as The Fugitive , Perry Mason , Route 66 , 77 Sunset Strip , Bewitched , and The Man from U.N.C.L.E . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast as a southern belle , and had a recurring role on the Andy Griffith Show as Peggy McMillan , the sheriff 's girlfriend . // On one of those shows , she met my father , then just a struggling actor . He was n't a dream-chasing migrant like she was but a native Angeleno , with a mother hellbent on propelling her two sons to stardom . My grandmother even pushed her youngest , my uncle Kevin , to study ballet and take growth hormones to groom him for the screen . // Patricia Callaghan , my grandmother , had sacrificed her own acting career to raise her children . She can still be seen in Three Came Home , the true story of a woman 's survival in a Japanese prison camp , starring Claudette Colbert . Born of a Russian mother ( who was named Devonovitch and rumored to be Jewish ) and an Irish father , she was raised in Toronto and San Francisco and instilled with a gloves-wearing , hair-ina- bun propriety that made her the polar - and harshly disapproving - opposite of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was more accepting and shared my mother 's southern roots and jolly temperament . Born in North Carolina , he attended the University of Iowa , where thanks to his accent , classmates dubbed him " Blackie , " and the nickname stuck . He met my grandmother in a San Diego theater troupe but discovered a new vocation - screenwriting - after publishing a short story in Esquire . My grandpa achieved modest success with screenplays for such movies as The Seventh Victim , Cry of the Werewolf , The Missing Juror , and Montana in the 1940s and 1950s ; then he moved on to writing for TV series , including The Untouchables , The Californians , and Lassie . Also the author of two novels , he developed one into the 1952 musical Three Wishes for Jamie , which starred John Raitt ( Bonnie 's father ) and Anne Jeffreys and ran for several months on Broadway . // ( Continues ... ) //
