Chapter One " Here . You do n't want to soak the little guy . " Rose Doeber blinked hard to make sure she was n't looking at a late night hallucination . After all , the light in the small , semiprivate hospital room was dim , and tears did tend to blur things . But when she refocused her eyes the big , gorgeous , dark-haired man in a black tuxedo was still standing on the other side of the only occupied railed bed from her , towering over the child asleep in it . He appeared as real as the snow-white handkerchief he was offering her . Not exactly used to being comforted by incredible-looking men in formal wear , she could n't think of anything else to do but reach toward him . He quickly rounded the bed , his shiny black shoes noisy on the sterile white linoleum , and gave her the handkerchief . " Thank you . " Her voice came out low and rough , transformed by the tears she 'd hastily tried to wipe away when he 'd first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best medicine . When he 'd first spoken from the shadows near the open door , beyond the reach of the bedside light , Rose had feared she 'd been caught by a fellow member of the hospital staff . She was well aware that most of her co-workers thought she was as hard as nails and much older than her thirty-one years . She 'd rather drink iodine than let any of them see her too-soft underbelly that her tough and tenacious routine was meant to protect . She 'd learned long ago that if no one knew she was vulnerable , no one could hurt her . Only late at night in the quiet of Chicago General 's pediatric ward , the place that had become her universe , did she let her guard down . Only at Dylan 's bedside did her worries about her bid to adopt the three-year-old overwhelm her . And that was when the memories came . Memories of waking up in this very hospital , a frightened six-year-old , with no idea who she was or why she 'd been left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how no one had come forward to claim her . That abandonment had n't been her last , either . She held the handkerchief to her eyes and clenched her teeth against the familiar pain . She refused to let Dylan start down that road . But with his incarcerated father stalling the adoption process , Rose had finally lost control tonight and succumbed to rare tears . She 'd been so alone for so long , with Dylan the only emotional connection she could trust , that she 'd thought her stressed mind had conjured up the image of her perfect man , a tower of strength and reliability . Someone who would never use her or abandon her . Someone who did n't exist . The guy in the tux said , " You 're welcome " and shook her from her self-pitying thoughts . While he might look like the sort of apparition that a heart as lonely as hers would conjure up , the rasp of his deep voice along her senses felt very real . And there was no denying the spicy , heady scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a sharp contrast to the disinfectant-tinged hospital air . He quietly cleared his throat , as if the rough edges of his baritone were n't normal , either . " Is there anything else I can do for you ? " His voice was much smoother now , almost cultured . " Call your husband ? Boyfriend ? " Rose scoffed as she wiped beneath her eyes with his incredibly soft handkerchief . " I 'm not married . No boyfriend . " He was silent for a moment , then added , " Is there anything you need ? " Too drained to throw out her usual response - to be left alone - she shook her head and dabbed at her nose . " No . " " Are you sure ? " he pressed . " I 'm amazingly resourceful . " Dropping her hands to her lap , she looked down at the square of linen he 'd pulled from within his tuxedo jacket , the white fabric stark against her black knit pants . Heaven only knew what a resourceful man might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his black cummerbund . She gave a rueful laugh . " I do n't doubt that you are , but there 's no way you could get me what I need . " " Try me , " he countered in a tone that made it clear he felt the need to prove her wrong . She met his gaze . His eyes appeared light brown in the lamp 's dim glow . Probably hazel . Definitely warm with concern . He raised a dark brow , reminding her that he was waiting to hear what she needed . Whatever he was delusional enough to think he could get her . Maybe he had reason for his delusions , though . He was clearly a man of means . No rental tux would ever fit the way his did . The set of his square jaw and the studied effortless style of his slightly wavy hair suggested a man who did what he wanted , and did it well . If only this wedding magazine escapee really was her perfect man . Her dream come true . Yeah , right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impossibly strong and tanned hand on the beige blanket at the end of the bed , a gold class ring glinting on his right ring finger . He directed his attention to Dylan . " Is he in a bad way ? " Rose followed his gaze , her heart melting as always at the sight of the precious towheaded little boy , his well-loved Bunny held close . " No . Thank God . For the most part he 's fine . Some digestive issues , but nothing serious . " She touched a gentle hand of her own on the sheet covering Dylan 's round tummy . " He just does n't speak . We 're trying to figure out why . " She completely understood Dylan 's inability to talk , just as she had finally come to understand - and accept - her inability to remember why she 'd been abandoned . Some things were best left unsaid or forgotten . That was what made her and Dylan kindred souls . Even though she knew what demons inhabited his nightmares along with his vital statistics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as she 'd thought of herself as Little Miss Nobody while growing up . No one had wanted her , and no one wanted him . No one but her . ( Continues ... )
