From Milan boardrooms to Parma dairy farms , Calisto Tanzi was long viewed as a model Italian entrepreneur  --  modest , hardworking and , above all , generous . Over four decades , as he built Parmalat , the food company he founded in Parma in 1961 , into a worldwide giant with annual sales of $9.6 billion , he showered the town with his philanthropy . A pious Catholic , Tanzi helped pay for a major restoration of Parma 's 11th century basilica . He poured cash into the local pro-soccer team , restored the theater and financed programs for the poor , AIDS patients and drug addicts . " He has got that impulse in him to just say yes , " says Monsignor Franco Grisenti , who oversaw the restoration of the basilica and is a close friend of Tanzi 's . <P> Now it turns out that Tanzi might have had some far less noble impulses too . On Dec. 27 , Tanzi was arrested , and he is confined in a Milan jail while Italian prosecutors , joined by the U.S. Securities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion fraud that could implicate Parmalat in Europe 's biggest corporate scandal ever , easily on a par with those of Enron and WorldCom in the U.S. Parmalat has filed for bankruptcy , and corporate-turnaround expert Enrico Bondi is trying to salvage what he can of the firm , which has 36,000 employees in 30 countries , including 7,300 in North America . Among its holdings is Archway Cookies , now on the block . Along with Tanzi , seven others connected with Parmalat were arrested last week . <P> Prosecutors allege that Parmalat created an elaborate house of milk cartons , using opaque subsidiaries ( including one called Buconero , which means " black hole " ) in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg to hide the declining state of its finances . Tanzi has reportedly admitted shifting some $630 million from the company to other businesses but insists some underlings devised the accounting fraud . Former chief financial officer Fausto Tonna has given prosecutors crucial details about the firm 's labyrinthine bookkeeping . <P> Parmalat unraveled quickly  --  and seemingly out of nowhere  --  after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompting tougher scrutiny of its books by Italian regulators and its own auditors . A follow-up audit produced a stunner : an account held by the company at Bank of America in New York City that supposedly contained about $5 billion turned out not to exist . All the paperwork , including written confirmation from the bank to Parmalat 's auditors , had been forged , Bank of America said . " What is shocking here is that it appears the assets were just plain fabricated , " says Evan D. Flaschen , an attorney at the U.S. law firm Bingham McCutchen , who represents institutional holders of Parmalat bonds . <P> Why was n't such an amateurish fraud detected earlier ? Grant Thornton , Parmalat 's primary auditor for most of the 1990s and still auditor of some of its subsidiaries , initially said it too had been duped . But on New Year 's Eve , Grant Thornton suspended the head of its Italian affiliate and another partner after the two were arrested as part of the investigation . The men have denied any wrongdoing .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
