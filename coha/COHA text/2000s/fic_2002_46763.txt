translated by Jay Rubin Junko was watching television when the phone rang a few minutes before midnight . Keisuke sat in the corner of the room wearing headphones , eyes half-closed , head swinging back and forth as his long fingers flew over the strings of his electric guitar . He was practicing a fast passage and obviously had no idea the phone was ringing . Junko picked up the receiver . <p> " Did I wake you ? " Miyake asked in his familiar muffled Osaka accent . <p> " Nah , " Junko said . " We 're still up . " <p> " I 'm at the beach . You should see all this driftwood ! We can make a big one this time . Can you come down ? " <p> " Sure , " Junko said . " Let me change clothes . I 'll be there in ten minutes . " <p> She slipped on a pair of tights and then her jeans . On top she wore a turtleneck sweater , and she stuffed a pack of cigarettes into the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . She nudged Keisuke in the back with her foot . He tore off his headphones . <p> " I 'm going for a bonfire on the beach , " she said . <p> " Miyake again ? " Keisuke asked with a scowl . " You 've got to be kidding . It 's February , you know . Twelve o'clock at night ! You 're going to go make a bonfire now ? " <p> " That 's okay , you do n't have to come . I 'll go by myself . " <p> Keisuke sighed . " Nah , I 'll come . Give me a minute to change . " <p> He turned off his amp , and over his pajamas he put on pants , a sweater , and a down jacket , which he zipped up to his chin . Junko wrapped a scarf around her neck and put on a knitted hat . <p> " You guys are crazy , " Keisuke said as they took the path down to the beach . " What 's so great about bonfires ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind at all . Words left their mouths to hang frozen in midair . <p> " What 's so great about Pearl Jam ? " Junko said . " Just a lot of noise . " <p> " Pearl Jam has ten million fans all over the world , " Keisuke said . <p> " Well , bonfires have had fans all over the world for fifty thousand years , " Junko said . <p> " You 've got something there , " Keisuke said . <p> " People will be lighting fires long after Pearl Jam is gone . " <p> " You 've got something there , too . " Keisuke pulled his right hand out of his pocket and put his arm around Junko 's shoulders . " The trouble is , I do n't have a damn thing to do with anything fifty thousand years ago-or fifty thousand years from now , either . Nothing . Zip . What 's important is now . Who knows when the world is going end ? Who can think about the future ? The only thing that matters is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up right now . Right ? " <p> They climbed the steps to the top of the breakwater . Miyake was down in his usual spot on the beach , collecting driftwood of all shapes and sizes and making a neat pile . One huge log must have taken a major effort to drag to the spot . <p> The light of the moon transformed the shoreline into a sharpened sword blade . The winter waves were strangely hushed as they washed over the sand . Miyake was the only one on the beach . <p> " Pretty good , huh ? " he said with a puff of white breath . <p> " Incredible ! " Junko said . <p> " This happens every once in a while . You know , we had that stormy day with the big waves . Lately , I can tell from the sound , like , Today some great firewood 's going to wash up . ' " <p> " Okay , okay , we know how good you are , " Keisuke said , rubbing his hands together . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's enough to shrivel your balls . " <p> " Hey , take it easy . There 's a right way to do this . First you 've got to plan it . And when you 've got it all arranged so it 'll work without a hitch , you light it slow-like . You ca n't rush it . The patient beggar earns his keep . ' " <p> " Yeah , " Keisuke said . " Like the patient hooker earns her keep : ' Miyake shook his head . " You 're too young to be making such crummy jokes all the time , " he said . <p> Miyake had done a skillful job of interlacing the bigger logs and smaller scraps until his pile had come to resemble some kind of avant-garde sculpture . Stepping back a few paces , he would examine in detail the form he had constructed , adjust some of the pieces , then circle around to the other side for another look , repeating the process several times . As always . All he had to do was look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin having mental images of the subtlest movement of the rising flames , the way a sculptor can imagine the pose of a figure hidden in a lump of stone . <p> Miyake took his time , but once he had everything arranged to his satisfaction , he nodded as if to say to himself , That 's it : perfect . Next , he bunched up sheets of newspaper that he had brought along , slipped them through the gaps at the bottom of the pile , and lit them with a plastic cigarette lighter . Junko took her cigarettes from her pocket , put one in her mouth , and struck a match . Narrowing her eyes , she stared at Miyake 's hunched back and balding head . This was it : the one heart-stopping moment of the whole procedure . Would the fire catch ? Would it erupt in giant flames ? <p> The three stared in silence at the mountain of driftwood . The sheets of newspaper flared up , rose swaying in flames for a moment , then shriveled and went out . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junko . The wood must have been wetter than it looked . <p> She was on the verge of losing hope when a plume of white smoke shot up from the pile . With no wind to disperse it , the smoke became an unbroken thread rising straight toward the sky . The pile must have caught fire somewhere , but still there was no sign of flames . <p> No one said a word . Even the talkative Keisuke kept his mouth shut tight , hands shoved in coat pockets . Miyake hunkered down on the sand . Junko folded her arms across her chest , cigarette in hand . She would puff on it occasionally , as if suddenly recalling that it was there . <p> As usual , Junko thought about Jack London 's " To Build a Fire . " It was the story of a man traveling alone through the snowy Alaskan interior and his attempts to light a fire . He would freeze to death unless he could make it catch . The sun was going down . Junko had n't read much fiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , ever since her teacher had assigned it as an essay topic during the summer vacation of her first year in high school . The scene of the story would always come vividly to mind as she read . She could feel the man 's fear and hope and despair as if they were her own ; she could sense the very pounding of his heart as he hovered on the brink of death . Most important of all , though , was the fact that the man was fundamentally longing for death . She knew that for sure . She could n't explain how she knew , but she knew it from the start . Death was really what he wanted . He knew that it was the right ending for him . And yet he had to go on fighting with all his might . He had to fight against an overwhelming adversary in order to survive . What most shook Junko was this deep-rooted contradiction . <p> The teacher ridiculed her view . " Death is really what he wanted ? That 's a new one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to say . " He read her conclusion aloud before the class , and everybody laughed . <p> But Junko knew . All of them were wrong . Otherwise , how could the ending of the story be so quiet and beautiful ? <p> " Uh , Mr. Miyake , " Keisuke ventured , " do n't you think the fire has gone out ? " <p> " Do n't worry , it 's caught . It 's just getting ready to flare up . See how it 's smoking ? You know what they say : Where there 's smoke , there 's fire . ' " <p> " Well , you know what else they say : Where there 's blood , there 's a hard-on . ' " <p> " Is that all you ever talk about ? " <p> " No , but how can you be so sure it has n't gone out ? " <p> " I just know . It 's going to flare up . " <p> " How did you come to master such an art , Mr. Miyake ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I learned it when I was a Boy Scout . When you 're a Scout , like it or not , you learn everything there is to know about building a fire . " <p> " I see , " said Keisuke . " A Boy Scout , huh ? " <p> " That 's not the whole story , of course . I have a kind of talent , too . I do n't mean to brag , but when it comes to making a bonfire I have a special talent that most folks just do n't have . " <p> " It must give you a lot of pleasure , but I do n't suppose this talent of yours makes you lots of money . " <p> " True . None at all , " Miyake said with a smile . <p> As he had predicted , a few small flames began to flicker at the center of the pile , accompanied by a faint crackling sound . Junko let out a long-held breath . Now there was nothing to worry about . They would have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch out their hands . For the next few minutes there was nothing more to be done but to watch in silence as , little by little , the flames gained in strength . Those people of fifty thousand years ago must have felt like this when they held their hands out to the flames , thought Junko . <p> " I understand you 're from Kobe , Mr. Miyake , " Keisuke said in a cheery voice , as if the thought had suddenly popped into his head . " Did you have relatives or something in the Kansai earthquake last month ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , " said Miyake . " I do n't have any ties with Kobe anymore . Not for years . " <p> " Years ? Well , you sure have n't lost your Kansai accent . " <p> " No ? I ca n't tell , myself . " <p> " I do declare , you must be joking , " said Keisuke in exaggerated Kansai tones . <p> " Cut the shit , Keisuke . The last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to me in a phony Kansai accent . You eastern farm boys would be better off tearing around on your motorcycles during the slack season . " <p> " Whoa , I sure rubbed you the wrong way ! You look like a nice quiet guy , but you 've got one hell of a mouth . And this place is Ibaraki , not Ibaragi . ' All you Kansai types are ready to put us eastern farm boys ' down at the drop of a hat . I give up " Keisuke said . " But seriously , though , did anybody get hurt ? You must have had somebody you know in Kobe . Have you seen the news on TV ? " <p> " Let 's change the subject , " Miyake said . " Whiskey ? " <p> " You bet . " <p> " Jun ? " <p> " Just a little , ' Junko said . <p> Miyake pulled a thin metal flask from the pocket of his leather jacket and handed it to Keisuke , who twisted off the cap and poured some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim . He glugged it down and sucked in a sharp breath . <p> " That is great ! " he said . " This has got to be a twenty-one-year  --  old single malt ! Super stuff ! Aged in oak . You can hear the roar of the sea and the breath of Scottish angels . " <p> " Give me a break , Keisuke . It 's the cheapest Suntory you can buy . " <p> Next it was Junko 's turn . She took the flask from Keisuke , poured a little into the cap , and tried a few tiny sips . She grimaced , but chased after that special warm feeling as the liquid moved down from her throat to her stomach . The core of her body grew a touch warmer . Next , Miyake took one quiet swallow , and Keisuke followed him with another gulp . As the flask moved from hand to hand , the bonfire grew in size and strength-not all at once , but in slow , gradual stages . That was the great thing about Miyake 's bonfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an expert caress , with nothing rough or hurried about it-their only purpose was to warm people 's hearts . <p> Junko never said much in the presence of the fire . She hardly moved . The flames accepted all things in silence , drank them in , understood , and forgave . A family , a real family , was probably like this , she thought . <p> Junko came to this town in May of her third year in high school . With her father 's seal and passbook , she had taken three hundred thousand yen from the bank , stuffed all the clothes she could into a Boston bag , and run away from home . She transferred from one train to the next at random until she had come all the way from Tokorozawa to this little seaside spot in Ibaraki Prefecture , a town she had never even heard of . At the realtor 's across from the station she found a one-room apartment , and the following week took a job at a convenience store on the coast highway . To her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and please do n't look for me , I 'm doing fine . <p> She was sick to death of school and could n't stand the sight of her father . She had gotten on well with him when she was little . On weekends and holidays the two of them had gone everywhere together . She felt proud and strong to walk down the street holding his hand . But when her periods started near the end of elementary school , and her pubic hair began to grow , and her chest began to swell , he started to look at her in a strange new way . After she passed five-foot-six in the third year of junior high , he hardly spoke to her at all . <p> Plus , her grades were nothing to boast about . Near the top of her class when she entered middle school , by graduation time it would have been easier to count her place from the bottom , and she barely made it into high school . Which is not to say that she was stupid : she just could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever she tried to concentrate , her head would ache deep inside . It hurt her to breathe , and the rhythm of her heart became irregular . Attending school was absolute torture . <p> Not long after she settled in this new town , she met Keisuke . He was two years older , and a great surfer . He was tall , dyed his hair brown , and had beautiful straight teeth . He had settled in Ibaraki for its good surf , and formed a rock band with some friends . He was registered at a second-rate private college , but hardly ever went to campus and had zero prospects of graduating . His parents ran an old respected sweetshop in the city of Mito , and he could have carried on the family business as a last resort , but he had no intention of settling down as a sweetshop owner . All he wanted was to ride around with his friends in his Datsun truck , surf , and play the guitar in their amateur band-an easygoing lifestyle that anyone could see was not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved in with Keisuke . Miyake seemed to be in his mid-forties-a small , slim guy with glasses , a long , narrow face , and short hair . He was clean-shaven , but he had such a heavy beard that by sundown each day his face was covered in shadows . He liked to wear a faded dungaree shirt or aloha shirt , which he never tucked into his baggy old chinos , and on his feet he wore white , worn-out sneakers . In winter , he would put on a creased leather jacket and sometimes a baseball cap . Junko had never seen him in any other kind of outfit . Everything he wore , though , was spotlessly clean . <p> Speakers of the Kansai dialect were all but nonexistent in this place , so people noticed Miyake . " He lives alone in a rented house near here , " one of the girls at work told Junko . " He paints pictures . I do n't think he 's famous or anything , and I 've never seen his stuff . But he lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo sometimes and comes back late in the day with painting supplies or something . Gee , I do n't know , he 's maybe been here five years or so . You see him on the beach all the time making bonfires . I guess he likes them . I mean , he always has this intense look in his eyes when he 's making one . He does n't talk much , and he 's kind of weird , but he 's not a bad guy . " <p> Miyake would come to the convenience store at least three times a day . In the morning he 'd buy milk , bread , and a newspaper . At noon , he 'd buy a box lunch , and in the evening he 'd buy a cold can of beer and a snack-the same thing , day after day . He and Junko never exchanged more than the barest civilities , but she found herself drawn to him after a while . <p> When they were alone in the store one morning , she took a chance and asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if he did live close-by ? Why did n't he just buy lots of milk and beer and keep it in the refrigerator ? Would n't that be more convenient ? Of course , it was all the same to the store people , but still ... <p> " Yeah , I guess you 're right , " he said . " It 'd make more sense to stock up , but I ca n't . " <p> " Why not ? " Junko asked . <p> " Well , it 's just , like-I ca n't , that 's all . " <p> " I did n't mean to pry or anything , " Junko said . " Please do n't let it bother you . It 's just the way I am . I ca n't help asking questions when I do n't know something . I do n't mean any harm by it . " <p> Miyake hesitated a moment , scratching his head . Then , with some difficulty , he said , " Tell you the truth , I do n't have a refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " I do n't like refrigerators myself , but I do have one . Is n't it kind of inconvenient not having one ? " <p> " Sure it 's inconvenient , but I hate the things , so what can I do ? I ca n't sleep at night when there 's a refrigerator around . " <p> What a weird guy , thought Junko . But now she was more interested in him than ever . <p> Walking on the beach one evening a few days later , Junko saw Miyake tending a bonfire , alone . It was a small fire made of driftwood he had collected . Junko spoke to Miyake , then joined him at the fire . Standing beside him , she was a good couple of inches taller . The two of them traded simple greetings , then said nothing at all as they stared at the fire . <p> It was the first time that Junko felt a certain " something " as she watched the flames of a bonfire : " something " deep down , a " wad " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too raw , too heavy , too real to be called an idea . It coursed through her body and vanished , leaving behind a sweet-sad , chest-gripping , strange sort of feeling . For a time after it had gone , she had goose flesh on her arms . <p> " Tell me , Mr. Miyake , when you see the shapes that a bonfire makes , do you ever feel kind of strange ? " <p> " How so ? " <p> " I do n't know , it 's like all of a sudden you get very clear about something people do n't usually notice in everyday life . I do n't know how to put it , I 'm not smart enough , but watching the fire now , I get this deep , quiet kind of feeling . " <p> Miyake thought about it awhile . " You know , Jun , " he said , " a fire can be any shape it wants to be . It 's free . So it can look like anything at all depending on what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this deep , quiet kind of feeling when you look at a fire , that 's because it 's showing you the deep , quiet kind of feeling you have inside yourself . You know what I mean ? " <p> " Uh-huh . " <p> " But it does n't happen with just any fire . For something like this to happen , the fire itself has to be free . It wo n't happen with a gas stove or a cigarette lighter . It wo n't even happen with an ordinary bonfire . For the fire to be free , you 've got to make it in the right kind of place . Which is n't easy . Not just anybody can do it . " <p> " But you can do it , Mr. Miyake ? " <p> " Sometimes I can , sometimes I ca n't . Most of the time , I can . If I really put my mind to it , I pretty much can . " <p> " You like bonfires , do n't you ? " <p> Miyake nodded . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I came to live in this navel-lint nothing of a town ? It 's because this place gets more driftwood than any other beach I know . That 's the only reason . I came all the way out here to make bonfires . Kind of pointless , huh ? " <p> Whenever she had the chance after that , Junko would join Miyake for his bonfires . He made them all year long except for midsummer , when the beach was full of people far into the night . Sometimes he would make two a week , and sometimes he would go a month without one . His pace was determined by the amount of driftwood that washed ashore . And when the time came for a fire , he would be sure to call Junko . Keisuke had an ugly jealous streak , but Miyake was the one exception . He would rib Junko about her " bonfire buddy . " <p> The flames finally found their way to the biggest log , and now at last the bonfire was settling in for a long burn . Junko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames with her mouth shut tight . Miyake adjusted the progress of the fire with great care , using a long branch to keep the flames from either spreading too quickly or losing strength . From his small pile of spare fuel , he would occasionally pick a length of driftwood and toss it in where it was needed . <p> Keisuke announced that he had a stomachache : " Must 've caught a chill . Think I just need a crap . " <p> " Why do n't you go home and rest ? " Junko said . <p> " Yeah , I really should , Keisuke said , looking sorry for himself . " How about you ? " <p> " Do n't worry about Jun , " Miyake said . " I 'll see her home . She 'll be fine . " <p> " Okay , then . Thanks . " Keisuke left the beach . <p> " He 's such an idiot , " Junko said , shaking her head . " He gets carried away and drinks too much . " <p> " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good being too sensible when you 're young . It just spoils the fun . Keisuke 's got his good points , too . " <p> " Maybe so , but he does n't use his brain for anything . " <p> " Some things your brain ca n't help you with . It 's not easy being young . " <p> The two fell silent for a while in the presence of the fire , each lost in private thoughts and letting time flow along separate paths . Then Junko said , " You know , Mr. Miyake , something 's been kind of bothering me . Do you mind if I ask you about it ? " <p> " What kind of something ? " <p> " Something personal . " <p> Miyake scratched his stubbly cheeks with the flat of his hand . " Well , I do n't know . I guess it 'd be okay . " <p> " I was just wondering if , maybe , you had a wife somewhere . " <p> Miyake pulled the flask from the pocket of his leather jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . Then he put on the cap , slipped the flask into his pocket , and looked at Junko . <p> " Where did that come from all of a sudden ? " <p> " It 's not all of a sudden . I kind of got the feeling before , when Keisuke started talking about the earthquake . I saw the look on your face . And you know what you once told me , about how people 's eyes have something honest about them when they 're watching a fire . " <p> " I did ? " <p> " And do you have kids , too ? " <p> " Yup . Two of ' em . " <p> " In Kobe , right ? " <p> " That 's where the house is . I suppose they 're still living there . " <p> " Where in Kobe ? " <p> " The Higashi-Nada section . Up in the hills . Not much damage there . " <p> Miyake narrowed his eyes , raised his face , and looked out at the dark sea . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's why I ca n't blame Keisuke , " he said . " I ca n't call him an idiot . I do n't have the right . I 'm not using my brain any more than he is . I 'm the idiot king . I think you know what I mean . " <p> " Do you want to tell me more ? " <p> " No , " Miyake said . " I really do n't . " <p> " Okay , I 'll stop , then . But I will say this . I think you 're a good person . " <p> " That 's not the problem " Miyake said , shaking his head again . He drew a kind of design in the sand with the tip of a branch . " Tell me , Jun , have you ever thought about how you 're going to die ? " <p> Junko pondered this for a while , then shook her head . <p> " Well , I think about it all the time , " Miyake said . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside a refrigerator , " he said . " You know . It happens all the time . Some kid is playing around inside a refrigerator that somebody 's thrown away , and the door closes , and the kid suffocates . Like that . " <p> The big log dipped to the side , scattering sparks . Miyake watched it happen but did nothing . The glow of the flames spread strangely unreal shadows across his face . <p> " I 'm in this tight space , in total darkness , and I die little by little . It might not be so bad if I could just plain suffocate . But it does n't work that way . A tiny bit of air manages to get in through some crack , so it takes a really long time . I scream , but nobody can hear me . And nobody notices I 'm missing . It 's so cramped in there , I ca n't move . I squirm and squirm , but the door wo n't open . " <p> Junko said nothing . <p> " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night drenched in sweat . I 've been dreaming about dying slowly in pitch-blackness , but even after I wake up , the dream does n't end . This is the scariest part of the dream . I open my eyes , and my throat is absolutely dry . I go to the kitchen and open the refrigerator . Of course , I do n't have a refrigerator , so I ought to realize it 's a dream , but I still do n't notice . I 'm thinking there 's something strange going on , but I open the door . Inside , the refrigerator is pitch-dark . The light 's out . I wonder if there 's been a power failure and stick my head inside . Hands shoot out from the darkness and grab me by the neck . Cold hands . Dead people 's hands . They 're incredibly strong , and they start dragging me inside . I let out a huge scream , and this time I wake up for real . That 's my dream . It 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time I have it , it 's just as scary as the last . " <p> Miyake poked the big log with the tip of a branch and pushed it back in place . <p> " It 's so real , I feel as if I 've already died hundreds of times . " <p> " When did you start having the dream ? " <p> " Way , way back there . So long ago I ca n't remember when , " Miyake said . " I have had periods when it 's left me alone . A year ... no , two years when I did n't have it at all . I had the feeling things were going to be okay for me . But no . The dream came back . Just as I was beginning to think , I 'm okay now , I 'm saved , it started up again . And once it gets going , there 's nothing I can do . " <p> Miyake shook his head . <p> " I 'm sorry , Jun , I really should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should Junko said . She put a cigarette between her lips and struck a match , inhaling a deep lungful of smoke . " Go on . " <p> The bonfire was nearing its end . The big pile of extra driftwood was gone now . Miyake had thrown it all into the fire . Maybe she was imagining things , but Junko thought the ocean sounded louder . <p> " There 's this American writer called Jack London , " Miyake began . <p> " Sure , the guy who wrote about the fire . " <p> " That 's him . For a long time , he thought he was going to die by drowning in the sea . He was absolutely sure of it . He 'd slip and fall into the ocean at night , and nobody would notice , and he 'd drown . " <p> " Did he really drown ? " <p> Miyake shook his head . " Nope . Killed himself with morphine . " <p> " So his premonition did n't come true . Or maybe he did something to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the surface , at least , it looks like that , " Miyake said , pausing for a moment . " But in a sense , he was right . He did drown alone in a dark sea . He became an alcoholic . He soaked his body in his own despair-right to the core-and he died in agony . Premonitions can stand for something else sometimes . And the thing they stand for can be a lot more intense than reality . That 's the scariest thing about having a premonition . Do you see what I mean ? " <p> Junko thought about it for a while . She did not see what he meant . <p> " I 've never once thought about how I was going to die , " she said . " I ca n't think about it . I do n't even know how I 'm going to live . " <p> Miyake gave a nod . " I know what you mean , " he said . " But there 's such a thing as a way of living that 's guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Is that how you 're living ? " she asked . <p> " I 'm not sure . It seems that way sometimes . " <p> Miyake sat down next to Junko . He looked a little more wasted and older than usual . The hair over his ears was uncut and sticking out . <p> " What kind of pictures have you been painting ? " she asked . <p> " That would be tough to explain . " <p> " Okay , then , what 's the newest thing you 've painted ? " <p> " I call it Landscape with Flatiron . I finished it three days ago . It 's just a picture of an iron in a room . " <p> " Why 's that so tough to explain ? " <p> " Because it 's not really an iron . " <p> She looked up at him . " The iron is not an iron ? " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " Meaning it stands for something else ? " <p> " Probably . " <p> " Meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand for it ? " <p> Miyake nodded in silence . <p> Junko looked up to see that there were many more stars in the sky than before . The moon had covered a long distance . Miyake threw the last piece , the long branch he was holding , into the fire . Junko leaned toward him so that their shoulders were just touching . The smoky smell of a hundred fires clung to his jacket . She took in a long , deep breath of it . <p> " You know something ? " she said . <p> " What ? " <p> " I 'm completely empty . " " Yeah ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> She closed her eyes , and before she knew it , tears were flowing down her cheeks . With her right hand , she gripped Miyake 's knee as hard as she could through his chinos . Small chills ran through her body . He put his arm around her shoulders and drew her close , but still her tears would not stop . <p> " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much later , her voice hoarse . " I 'm cleaned out . Empty . " <p> " I know what you mean , " he said . <p> " Really ? " <p> " Yeah . I 'm an expert . " <p> " What can I do ? " <p> " Get a good night 's sleep . That usually fixes it . " <p> " What I 've got is not so easy to fix . " <p> " You may be right , Jun . It may not be that easy . " <p> Just then a long , steamy hiss announced the evaporation of water trapped in a log . Miyake raised his eyes and , narrowing them , peered at the bonfire for a time . <p> " So , what should I do ? " Junko asked . <p> " I do n't know . We could die together . What do you say ? " <p> " Sounds good to me . " <p> " Are you serious ? " <p> " I 'm serious . " <p> His arm still around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried her face in the soft worn-out leather of his jacket . <p> " Anyhow , let 's wait till the fire burns out , " Miyake said . " We built it , so we ought to keep it company to the end . Once it goes out , and it turns pitch-dark , then we can die . " <p> " Good , " Junko said . " But how ? " <p> " I 'll think of something . " <p> " Okay . " <p> Wrapped in the smell of the fire , Junko closed her eyes . Miyake 's arm across her shoulders was rather small for that of a grown man , and strangely bony . I could never live with this man , she thought . I could never get inside his heart . But I might be able to die with him . <p> She felt herself growing sleepy . It must be the whiskey , she thought . Most of the burning driftwood had turned to ash and crumbled , but the biggest piece still glowed orange , and she could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while before it burnt itself out . <p> " Mind if I take a little nap ? " she asked . <p> " Sure , go ahead . " <p> " Will you wake me when the fire 's out ? " <p> " Do n't worry . When the fire goes out , you 'll start feeling the cold . You 'll wake up whether you want to or not . " <p> She repeated the words in her mind : When the fire goes out , you 'll start feeling the cold . You 'll wake up whether you want to or not . Then she curled herself against him and dropped into a fleeting , but deep , sleep . <p> Author Affiliation
