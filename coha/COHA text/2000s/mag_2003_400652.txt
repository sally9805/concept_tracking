John McCain has a new job . American industry had better pay attention . // Senator John McCain is having a good day . He has chided the president of Goldman Sachs and admonished the owner of the Houston Astros . He has frustrated the Democrats ' point person on taxes and ducked calls from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission . He 's held two press conferences-one his fellow Republicans loved ; the other they hated . And it 's only four o'clock ! He still has plenty of people to provoke before the day is done . This is the new John McCain . He 's a lot like the old John McCain-volatile , unpredictable , opinionated , sweater-clad  --  but he has a new aim in life . At age 66 , having shelved his presidential ambitions , he says that he now wants to focus his energies on making policy and hopes to conclude his public career as a productive legislator . His job as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee makes that a plausible goal . The business lobby is watching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill , has the clout to get things done . And what McCain wants to do is making CEOs very , very anxious . McCain sees himself as a Republican in the mold of Theodore Roosevelt-who famously described himself as an enemy of " malefactors of great wealth . " McCain , for his part , is on a mission to make corporations more accountable . From his committee chair , he oversees a wide swath of American industry . He has the right to hold hearings on and mouth off about everything from aviation to telecommunications . He can also weigh in on issues that cut across industries-corporate governance , for example . Feeling fine after surgery for melanoma two years ago , he 's ready to do battle , and the prospect of messing with polluters and fat cats has ignited his imagination . " Being chairman of the Commerce Committee , " he says , " is like being a mosquito in a nudist colony . " If McCain has his way , many industries will feel his bite . He 's going after utilities with legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's targeting automakers with proposals to increase SUV safety and lower gasoline consumption . He could inflict pain on drug companies with a measure that would encourage the sale of generic drugs . Defense contractors are in his cross hairs whenever he launches one of his attacks on pork-barrel spending . Of the armament firms and others , he says , with obvious satisfaction : " They 're not happy to see me coming . " Not happy , indeed . A prominent business lobbyist says that McCain may not be Washington 's most powerful person  --  President Bush is- " but he 's probably the most dangerous . " Yes , he 's a reliable backer of free trade and usually of deregulation . But on business issues he 's just as likely to make common cause with Democrats as members of his own party . And no representative of the corporate class likes to hear McCain 's screeds against special interests and executive greed . McCain is none too popular with the leaders of his own party either . He alienated them by fighting for campaign finance reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent . GOP leaders would certainly prefer a different Commerce chairman , but the party 's success in the last election ensured it would be McCain . ( The senior committee member of the majority party gets the chair . ) When asked which industries would like McCain to disappear , John Weaver , a senior McCain advisor , replies , " Is the RNC Republican National Committee an industry ? " McCain has thought a lot about his position as a Republican maverick . After George W. Bush beat him for the party 's nomination in 2000 , McCain reconsidered his place in the Washington firmament . If he was n't going to be President , he sure did n't want to be remembered as a loudmouthed gadfly who 'd lost more battles than he 'd won . But his independence is also a source of strength . As chairman of a standing committee , McCain is influential by definition , and his notoriety gives him an advantage his more politic peers do n't have : The public listens to him . He 's a bestselling author and sought-after speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through his political action committee , he has instant e-mail access to 250,000 activists who are eager to advocate his every initiative . More important on the legislative front , he 's a ringleader of the ten or so centrist Senators who will decide what passes and what fails in the narrowly divided Senate . Republicans have only nominal control there , with 51 votes . " He has a long reach from many vantage points and therefore tremendous power , " says another centrist , Nebraska Republican Chuck Hagel . In the coming months McCain will have plenty of opportunity to exercise that power on business issues-assuming the Iraq conflict is resolved quickly . The FCC will decide this spring whether to loosen regulations that limit the number of media outlets a single company can own , and McCain and committee get to choose whether to block changes or let them go through . As one of the most prominent Republican dissenters on President Bush 's tax plan-he particularly dislikes the proposed dividend exclusion  --  McCain will be key to any compromise . All of which makes him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are advised to brace themselves . One day in February , Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane , along with Major League Baseball 's top lobbyist , visits McCain and thank him for urging the league to ban the use of steroids . In response McCain warns that he 's watching to make sure the new rule takes effect . McCain is less diplomatic with John Thain , the president of Goldman Sachs . Investor confidence is so low , he tells Thain , that audiences break into loud applause when he suggests that crooked executives should go to jail . " What if you guys on Wall Street come out with an Investors ' Bill of Rights ? " he prods . The implied threat : Congress might devise one if Wall Street does n't . On that same day Senator Max Baucus of Montana , the senior Democrat on the tax-writing committee , courts McCain on tax cuts . McCain considers Bush 's tax plan too expensive , too weighted toward the wealthy , and not much of a short-term economic stimulus , besides . Democrats are making these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain into his fold . McCain suggests a payroll-tax holiday to help low- and middle-income families , but Baucus balks at the idea , saying it could look like tampering with Social Security . The two promise to talk again , but probably not before Charles Grassley of Iowa , the Senate 's chief GOP tax writer , makes his olav for McCain . If McCain wants to succeed in the legislating game , however , he 'll have to learn to scratch his colleagues ' backs as well as poke them in the ribs . That wo n't be easy . His prickly personality and instinct to provoke can rub people the wrong way . In the hushed , clubby atmosphere of the Senate , his occasional noisy tirades get attention . Hagel , whose office is located across the hall from McCain 's , says , only half in jest , " I 'm the only one who 'd take that office . I should get combat pay . " McCain knows he can be his own worst enemy , and he 's trying to reform . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation of high-tech CEOs that included Sam Palmisano of IBM , Craig Barrett of Intel , Carly Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard , and Michael Dell . When they stepped into his cozy office , his inner populist was itching to cause trouble by asking , " Say , how much did you get in stock options last year ? " But he held his tongue . Instead they chatted amiably , agreeing on issues as wide ranging as digital copyright protection and Internet privacy . What made him play nice ? " To maintain communications with some of America 's leaders in information technology is an important thing for me to do , " McCain says . The CEOs had their own reason for restraint . " We understand that more than half of our agenda is in his committee 's jurisdiction , " says Ken Kay , the lobbyist for the computer manufacturers ' group . McCain wo n't always hold his fire . He 'll attack in two different ways . Plan A is to try to pass conventional legislation . He plans , for example , to force a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large business groups oppose . But given his rocky relations with the Republicans and the difficulty of passing any legislation , he also has a Plan B : public embarrassment . As a celebrity with the authority to call hearings , he will regularly haul CEOs before his committee for what he calls public " education . " Lowry Mays , CEO of the $8-billion-a  --  year radio-station consolidator Clear Channel , was the object lesson of this educating in January . With cameras rolling , McCain grilled Mays with furrowed brow and obvious disdain . McCain made his point : He disapproves of too much media consolidation . McCain wo n't reveal his next victims . Aides say they are likely to include cable companies ( McCain objects to rate hikes ) , telecoms ( he wants them to extend broadband services to rural areas ) , and broadcasters ( he thinks they should provide free airtime to politicians to reduce the influence of money on politics ) . McCain will also become a bigger player on the issue of corporate corruption . He just hired a Commerce Committee investigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll bring his ample energy fully to bear . As he bounds down a marble staircase in the Capitol , he says , " This is what I want to do with my life : affect public policy . I love it !
