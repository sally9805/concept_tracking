Late night in early winter . The last hour of the long drive home . I tend to the thermostat , keeping the car warm enough for my sleeping family , but not so warm that my focus turns dull . Beyond the chilled glass to my left , green dashboard lights angle up toward the stars . <p> Distance defines our relations . My wife 's parents live five hundred miles away , what we have come to think of as a day 's drive . <p> When we arrive , she will hoist our son high against her chest and take him , murmuring his dreams , into the house . I will carry our long-legged daughter from our car to her room , where I will lay her gently on the bed we have made for her . <p> I remember being proud that I had n't fallen asleep . <p> " You go ahead and rest , ' my father told me . " I 'll let you know when we get there . " <p> But I had promised my mother I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged my pillow , to keep warm . The truck 's heater was n't working . A good thing , according to my father ; it would have only made us drowsy . This was November , sometime between my birthday-which we had celebrated in an empty house , amid packed boxes-and Thanksgiving . Under my father 's influence , the past Christmas Eve , I had seen a reindeer 's red nose from my bedroom window ; with the same power of persuasion , he had convinced me , at least , that our move from Maryland to North Carolina-a place so far off it might as well have been wholly imaginary-was a great adventure . <p> When we finally left the highway , he said , " Home at last . " There at our exit were three big hotels and a restaurant called the Kountry Kitchen and another called Noah 's and a go-cart track . My attention lingered on the go-cart track , which was closed . It was after midnight , the latest I had ever been out in my life . <p> My father stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a piece of paper he had drawn from his shirt pocket . We turned left , and then right , and then there were no more hotels , no more restaurants-nothing but a curving road . The farther we went down that road , the more I worried about what my mother would think . She had made no secret of her opposition to the move ; rather , she had expressed this so strongly that I harbored the unspoken fear that she might not follow us . She was very much in my mind as we passed a small house with a chain-link fence strung with Christmas lights that somehow looked as if they had n't been taken down the winter before , and a collapsing larger house , with covered porches on three sides , and beside it a field populated by broken school buses and eyeless shells of trucks . ( To be honest : I 'm not sure how many of those things I took in that first night ; but they were there the next morning , when the overall impression of neglect and decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just started to think that if we went far enough , we 'd get away from this kind of place , we 'd reach another road with bright lights and hotels and restaurants , when my father slowed down , then stopped , then backed up . <p> " Here we are , " he said . " Camelot . " He had told me his version of the legend of King Arthur on the ride . We had sung songs , and told riddles , and played games using the letters on billboards . My father could always be depended on to think of something interesting to do . On the edge of a field across from the entrance to the Natural Bridge , in Virginia ( which we did not see , as there was an admission charge ) , we ate sandwiches my mother had packed , and played a game he invented using two sticks and a crab apple . Later , while we drove , my father wedged a paper cup between the dash and the windshield and had me take shots with a crumpled cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were football fans , my father and I , but we would play any game that presented itself . <p> Rule number one , he liked to say : Keep your options open . My mother arrived two days later , in my father 's pickup truck . We had made a sign for the door-Welcome Home-but that did n't appear to register . Even before she went inside , I understood that the pizza we had watched the pizza man spin almost to the ceiling , the cupcakes for dessert , and the grocery-store flowers my father had arranged in a beer bottle on the tiny countertop would not be sufficient to create , for my mother , a mood of celebration . <p> The trailer park was not a park , as I had imagined , but a series of crude terraces cut into the side of a steep clay hill , with a gravel road up the middle and a security light at the top of a telephone pole . There were twelve trailers , six on each side , and the way they were placed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look down into someone else 's kitchen , living room , and bedroom . The most desirable spots were the two at the top , which were relatively private-though none of the trailers could have been more than twenty feet from its neighbor-and had the best view of the woods across the road . Our trailer was at the very bottom , which meant , my mother said as she stood in the doorway , not unbuttoning her coat , everyone could see in . A modest woman , she sewed our curtains closed . <p> I woke to a strange sound . Not a dog , not a cat ... There had been talk of bears , and I hoped to see one in exactly those circumstances : from under the covers , safe inside our trailer . When I heard the sound again , and understood what I heard , it became a glowing ember , a warm promise . <p> My parents , laughing . Not my father alone , which I was used to , or my mother 's polite acknowledgment of a joke , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was followed by other sounds , and an exchange I either heard through the thin wall or imagined . The result of my father 's insistence , my mother 's reluctance , was my father rolling from the bed , then shuffling out to where I sensed I should pretend still to sleep . <p> Did she know what he meant to do ? I doubt it . My father believed in asking for forgiveness , not permission . <p> He slid one strong arm under my knees , another behind my shoulders , and lifted . I fought to suppress a smile of anticipation , expecting to be carried in to share with them the wonderful discovery they had made , the cause of their laughter . I felt my rear end sag , my father 's knee rise to prop me up . My feet , then my head , bumped against the wall of the trailer , and then the door was open , cool air reached under my blanket . In two long strides we were at the door of his truck , I heard the click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When my feet reached the far door , I understood this was n't the start of a late-night drive . I heard my father 's heavy step into the trailer , heard him return , and the passenger door opened once more . My head rose , then was lowered onto my pillow . Reaching under the blanket , he set in my hand the stuffed creature I slept with . <p> " Sweet dreams , " my father said , and shut the door . The first time I told this story , without a moment 's forethought , was ten years later . She had confided something about her own parents , and we were , after all , in the dark , in the back of her mother 's car . Her reaction surprised me , to the extent that I stored the memory in a room at the end of one of the long , turning hallways of the mind . <p> The moment we confine memories to words , images are obscured by the language , the understanding , we have now . To be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would write : <p> One-eyed kitten-white , stuffed , red stitches where a right eye would have been-on the open glove compartment door . ( My stage , where the kitten performed with a tire gauge and magnetic St. Christopher . ) <p> Dark shadows cast by the bright security light . <p> Some nights , loud adult voices from a trailer up the hill . Others , the long , low rumble of a freight train . <p> I tried to explain to that young woman , in her mother 's car , how it was that I did n't feel abandoned , or cast aside , but elated . My parents were happy ; I was playing my role , never opening my eyes when my father carried me out to the truck , or back to my room . But then I woke one dawn with the windows frosted over . The blanket had slipped , exposing my back to a chilled seatbelt buckle . <p> Huddled on the vinyl seat , wrapped as tight as I could get , I waited for my father to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the numbness of my ears and nose . Unable to deny my need , I made a plan : open the door silently , take long , barefoot strides across the gravel , use the bathroom , and return . But the instant I entered the trailer my mother awoke , began shrieking accusations at my father . Bundling me close to her chest , she carried me to their warm bed . <p> She intended comfort , but I felt crushing disappointment . If only I had sneaked back in . If only I had held out a little longer , my father would have been spared my mother 's anger , my mother spared her shame . <p> I can only guess how much time passed . My parents returned to their familiar relationship : my father exuberant , loud ( " Let 's all go dancing " " Let 's go down to the field and set off some fireworks " ) ; my mother quieter , more steady . She mended our clothes , and fed us , and took me for long walks along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could pet the horses and stare back at the newborn calves and take warm eggs from under his hens . She taught me songs like " Red Sails on the Sunset , " and " King of the Road . " Each time we went to the grocery store , she gave me a coin to use either on the noisy rides out front or on the clear-globed machines filled with worthless trinkets just inside the doors . My desire for those trinkets was as urgent as it was irrational ; I dreamed about the rides , the horse and ambulance and the blinking spaceship that rose , as one rode , until it angled toward the sky . Yet some days I dropped the coin into my pocket , remembering rule number one . <p> What I mean to say is , my mother was kind and generous and attentive . But my father shone with the brilliance of a sun . <p> He stocked vending machines with candy and crackers . It seemed to me the most marvelous job a father could have . Once we drove his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother said ) floor of the panel truck , him telling stories about people he had met . My father knew everyone in the world , and introduced me to them , one by one . " I 've got the boss with me today , " he 'd tell his customers . <p> His plan was to own and manage a fleet of sandwich wagons . It may not sound like much of an ambition , but my father had the charm of a scene-stealing actor , and convinced people he was going places . My mother must have thought so , because she married him young , against her parents ' advice . She was independent , and serious , and had , I imagine , plans of her own . <p> One day , an envelope arrived which gave her so much pleasure she said we could do whatever I wanted-which was to make cheese sandwiches and have a picnic on the large flat rock in the middle of the river we sometimes walked to , which we did . The envelope , she confided , contained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sender to be used by my mother to buy a car . This gift was a great mystery to me . Adding to the intrigue was the fact that , while she had known the envelope was coming , my father did not . That night , the news of the check and its intended use was the cause of prolonged debate . My mother did not cry , or curse-I never heard her curse . Rather , she grew quietly , darkly resolved . <p> I was a beneficiary of her insistence . In her yellow car we drove to the local branch library , and to the enormous central library , where my mother looked up one thing or another while I sat in a corner , happily lost in picture books and early readers . I never thought to ask what she was looking for . We also drove to the grocery store , where the women at the bakery gave me a tea cookie whether we bought anything from them or not , and took long rides on the Blue Ridge Parkway , where we hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boulder and read while I tested the seaworthiness of leaves and sticks in a narrow stream . <p> She bought a magnet with my name on it , which she fixed to the dashboard directly ahead of the passenger seat . The letters were raised , in script , and as we drove I traced my name again and again . <p> Bedtime came , and I said I wanted to sleep in the truck . <p> I remember planning my announcement , and thinking the gesture heroic ; I remember its silent reception . <p> Finally , my mother asked me why . <p> Because it was fun to sleep in the truck . ( This was not entirely a lie . I had come to think of the vinyl bench seat , with its warm smell of my father , as more truly mine than any part of the trailer . ) <p> My mother suggested that sleeping in the truck was not a good idea . <p> I must have responded badly . My memory is of getting my way , and an extra blanket , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its intended effect . <p> My mother was not an extravagant woman , but in the spring we washed her car every week . She would vacuum and clean the trailer , then together we would haul the vacuum cleaner and sponges and a bucket of hot , soapy water outside . I wore shorts . I had never owned a bathing suit , and my mother did not approve of children of any age " running around without a stitch . " Some days she wore her old housecleaning clothes , but other times she wore a one-piece bathing suit , an outfit that made her fair game for both of us . For me , it meant that she would n't be angry if I accidentally turned the hose in her direction . She would shriek , and grab the nozzle from my hand and aim it at me , and we would take turns exclaiming at the cold water and hosing the other down . For my father , the bathing suit seemed to guarantee that he would pick her up , and call her Daisy Mae in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made her laugh , but my father 's arrival almost always meant an end to our fun . <p> I never wondered what the neighbors thought when they heard my father going out to his truck in the middle of the night . I do n't know that any of them ever saw me inside . <p> In my memory , during the months we lived there , it was nearly always night . Some nights he collected me in his arms hardly waiting for me to scoop up my blanket and pillow . Other nights he stood in the space between the open truck door and the cab , or better yet , held me aloft , and talked a beery cloud . One night he turned his back to the security light and the rental trailers on concrete blocks stacked on clay , and we stared up at a reddish dot in the night . " Mars , " he said . " You might live there one day . " For a moment we both imagined such a thing . At least , I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always seemed like an observed heroic adventure , all rockets and thrusters and urgently shouted commands , that night I imagined life on Mars to be a quiet , solitary enterprise . <p> " Near the moon , " I said , silently equating moon with mother . <p> " That 's right , " he said . <p> Long after an introductory astronomy text set the record straight , the sense of the night that held sway over me was the one I gathered in my father 's arms . <p> The argument over my mother 's car may have seemed worse than it was , as I imagined myself in the middle of it . I do n't recall the expression on either of their faces , which suggests I was either standing outside , listening , or staring at the floor . She wanted to take the car to a service station ; my father wanted to do the work himself . It was a waste of money , he insisted . She claimed he would get distracted , or have to find a part at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weeks . My father 's tendency to stop short of finishing his projects was indisputable . <p> Nevertheless , he disputed it , said he 'd be damned if he 'd pay some high school dropout to do a half-assed job ( a remark meant to cut deep , as my mother had not graduated from high school ) . She said she 'd pay for it herself , and if he did n't want to follow her she 'd hitchhike home , she would n't have any trouble finding a man who would give her a ride , and something about that must have convinced my father that there was no stopping her , because he relented . <p> I rode with him , absorbed in a book from the library . I opened the crisp cover wide and put my nose close to the pages , inhaling the scents of ink and paper and the hands of boys before me . I turned the pages carefully , admiring the bold lettering of the title . I could n't have been more than a page into the story when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truck . <p> The scene in front of me remains perfectly clear . On the left side of the intersection , headed right , a blue pickup . On the right , a man in a straw hat getting out of a white sedan . And in the middle of the intersection , my mother 's car , with a horrible impression the width of the pickup truck 's bumper running from just ahead of the driver 's door to just behind it . Even before my father roared I saw , at the top of the door panel , a bright streak of red on the yellow paint . <p> Any number of people said it was a good thing I had gone in the truck . But the thought that pulsed through me for days , years , was that I should have been with my mother . It would have been such a small favor , to have ridden beside her . <p> In my dreams , she held out her hand . Night after night , I told her , " I 'm right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer . You can imagine the conversations with relatives , my father 's grief We insisted on going it alone , and lasted perhaps a month . There was an excruciating drive back to Maryland , where we said what we both a much-anticipated trip to the beach . <p> I should admit here that I came to resent some of my father 's decisions , and let him know it . Every so often he would burst onto the scene , trying in a weekend to make up for months without a phone call . There was another wife , and a child . Then a third wife , and two children . Those choices soured some people 's impression of him . <p> I do n't believe my father is a bad or shallow man . He was young , and heartbroken , and committed to the belief that life should be lived as if every day were a great adventure . That attitude can be terribly appealing . <p> Some people believed , and on one or two occasions even expressed , that my " new family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple , with energetic and companionable children . My mother 's brother , an amateur historian , encouraged intellectual curiosity in whatever form it took , bookish or less orthodox . My aunt is an industrious woman who believes boys should be able to replace a button and cook a decent meal , and girls had better be prepared to change a tire . The home they made was demanding , in the best sense , and supportive , and I mean for nothing I write here to imply a word of criticism of them , or anything but the deepest gratitude for all they have done for me . <p> And yet , inevitably , I have wondered what would have become of me if that other life , the one three of us began , had been allowed to continue . There might very well have been a different painful separation , other difficult times . I might have found my way into that same second household , under different circumstances . I realize I am indulging a deep streak of romanticism when I imagine that my mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently contradictory desires and sacrifices , and that I might have completed my childhood in the family that made me , gone on to live the life I was meant to live . <p> For a long time I believed that if my mother 's accident had been avoided , if my foundation had been more solid , everything that followed would have felt more certain . But every foundation is , eventually , shaken . My grandparents are gone now . As is my uncle . More and more , I find my nights , and my days , illuminated by the light of dying stars . <p> Soon our daughter will be too big for me to carry . <p> Imagination , abhorring a vacuum , insists on filling gaps ; assumptions made years later insinuate themselves as fact . If these memories I have tried so carefully to record are not , strictly , true , what is this that I 've made ? <p> O my mother . <p> O father . <p> We put our children to bed , and then we tell ourselves the stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
