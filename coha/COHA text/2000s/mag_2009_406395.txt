Barb Mills makes sure her larder is well stocked with lunch meat and cheese , crackers , raw veggies , granola bars and fruit , so 14 - year- old Drew , who started grade nine this year , can toss something healthy into his backpack for lunch . " Sometimes he will take leftovers from dinner the night before or a Pizza Pocket that can be microwaved at school . It will be interesting to see how often he eats at the cafeteria now that he 's hit high school . " At Drew 's elementary school , kids had to stay in their classrooms for 20 minutes at lunchtime . But that did n't stop some of his peers from heading off to a nearby corner store to buy a freezie rather than eat their packed lunch . What will happen to his lunch habits now that he 's in high school ? Drew 's friend Shawna , who just finished grade 11 at the same high school Drew attends , says when you get to high school there 's no such thing as lunch anymore . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawna . " People might nibble on a muffin or share a bag of chips while they hang out together at the park , but that 's it . Some kids just skip eating and play soccer ; others go to McDonald 's . My friends and I like to share a big plate of Thai noodles at the food court . " " Kids this age are on the move ; they do n't want to take the time to sit down and eat a knife-and-fork meal , " says Richmond , BC , dietitian Cristina Sutler , who specializes in child and adolescent nutrition . The sweet taste of freedom may help derail eating habits , which have been shown to deteriorate during these years . As kids eat more meals away from home , they may not always make the healthiest choices : " I remember in grade nine they had these giant cookies in the cafeteria that looked so good , so I bought one once for lunch - and there was so much grease from the cookie that it soaked right through the napkin and actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that young teens tend to skip meals ( especially breakfast and lunch ) , eat too much junk food and prefer pop or juice ( which nutritionists are n't keen about ) over milk . Few kids manage to get all of the servings recommended by Canada 's Food Guide . ( This may explain why they tend to decimate the fridge after school , when their hunger becomes ravenous . ) Why do n't they just eat when they 're hungry ? Kids this age are n't always in touch with their bodies , and so they do n't attribute a drop in energy in the afternoon to their diet , says Sutter . " I see kids in their early teens who are anemic or who fall asleep during the day , both of which are attributable to a bad diet " - meaning high in refined , low-fibre or sugary foods and lacking in protein and complex carbohydrates ( like whole grains ) that sustain energy over a longer time . What can parents do to encourage healthy noontime noshing ? The first step is to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects concentration and energy levels . Just pointing out that his fourth-period math class or afterschool soccer practice might go better if he ate lunch might motivate him . Then , says Sutter , work with your child 's inclination to graze and his desire to socialize . Some ideas : Think small . Kids need little bits of food in their knapsacks so they can snack all day long : mini-bagels with peanut butter or tuna , cheese strings and individually wrapped Gouda cheese , cut-up fruit , yogurt drinks , nuts or trail mix . Talk about it . Rather than insisting on a packed lunch , find out what he and his friends like to do , and work with that : He might like to buy a cheeseburger and a milk in the cafeteria , and bring a granola bar and an apple from home . Give him lunch money . This may not be an issue if your child 's school is n't located in an urban area , but $10. a week will mean he can join his friends on some days in buying lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Shawna 's school , kids sometimes club together and buy a loaf of bread and a tub of hummus at the grocery store . While it may not be the perfect lunch , it beats a can of Coke and a bag of chips .
