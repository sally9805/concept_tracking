Triple M Ranch , Arizona Territory FALL 1885 There was no place to run to , no place to hide . Jeb McKettrick , always careening recklessly from the core of his being to the circumference and back again , was caught between the bunkhouse wall and the manure pile , with all the rage of a woman scorned bearing down on him in redheaded , whip-wielding , chicken-scattering fury . Chloe Wakefield had found him , as surely as the needle of a compass finds due north , and chased him all the way from Indian Rock . Pretty much kept up , too , even though he 'd been on a fast horse . He was dead meat . The buggy she drove might have been a chariot , drawn by the four horses of the Apocalypse , instead of a battered conveyance and a single lathered and huffing nag , both hastily procured at the livery stable in town . For the length of a heartbeat , Jeb actually believed she meant to run him down , grind him into a pulp under the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless love of life , he could not help but conclude that there would have been a certain mercy in oblivion . At least then he would n't have had to deal with the problem . Clearly , he was not to be spared . After a minute or two , his stepmother 's chickens settled down a little , though , and went back to their ground-pecking and feather-shuffling . Maybe that was a good omen . The only rooster in evidence , Jeb scrambled for his trademark grin , his one talisman , found a shaky semblance of it , and stuck it to his mouth . He put his hands out from his sides and made himself the picture of innocent affability , though on the inside , he was a tangle of contradictory emotions  --  sweet terror , bitter amusement , and anger , too , because , dammit , he was right , and she was wrong . And because he had never guessed , before that day , that among his many secret and interchangeable selves lurked a yellow-bellied chicken heart . " Chloe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as a smooth reprimand . A red hen tapped briefly at the toe of his right boot ; he ankled it aside impatiently . Standing up in the buggy now , drawing back on the reins with powerful , delicate hands , Chloe fixed him in a sapphire glare . " Do n't you ' Chloe ' me , Jeb McKettrick ! " she commanded . " You 're a liar and a cheat and three kinds of devil  --  you 've all but ruined my reputation and my life , you sorry excuse for a man , and I have half a mind to whip the hide off you right here and now ! " He rolled his shoulders once , within his brown corduroy jacket , pushed his hat to the back of his head . He had no defense , other than his charm and good looks , which did not seem to be having any noticeable effect . " May I suggest , " he countered , with an ease that was wholly false , " that you consult the other half ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip , and clambered down ; all of this happened so quickly that the separate motions seemed to tumble into one continuous whole . Her auburn hair , falling from its pins and combs , blazed like fire around her face , which was flushed with outrage , and she advanced . " Scoundrel ! " she spat . " Rounder ! Do you have any idea what I 've been through because of you ? " " Chloe , " he said again , with hopeless goodwill . She took his measure with her eyes and plainly found him wanting , but she was a little calmer , it seemed to him . Or maybe she was merely winded by the mad rush from town . By some perverse twist of fate , he 'd just come out of the Bloody Basin Saloon when she stepped down from the afternoon stage , and he 'd been as surprised to see Chloe Wakefield as she 'd been to see him . He 'd made up his mind to face her , try to make peace , but when he 'd registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd panicked instead , mounted up , and ridden back to the ranch like a mouse bolting for a hole in the wall . " If there was any justice in this world , you would have sprouted horns and cloven hooves by now , " she burst out . Pink spots pulsed beneath her flawless cheekbones , and her lovely bosom rose and fell with the rapid , shallow rhythm of her breath . He waited . It was that or dive into the manure pile and try to bury himself . " Did you think I would n't find you someday ? " she asked , and though her eyes were still snapping with conviction , her tone was softer than before . Was she settling down ? He could n't rightly guess , and did n't want to err on the side of optimism , which was his natural inclination . " I guess it never occurred to me that you 'd come looking , " he replied , in all truth . He 'd fled to Tombstone , stung by the discovery that half his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own as well , and facing the probable loss of what he held most dear in all the world  --  the Triple M. By decree of the almighty Angus McKettrick , the ranch would go to the first of his three sons to marry and provide the old man with a grandchild , a contest his eldest brother Rafe had all but won by getting hitched to Emmeline . And now Kade was married , too , and still in the running . His own prospects had seemed worse than dismal at the time  --  who 'd have thought they could get worse ? Back then , Jeb 's plan had been to carouse his troubles away , bedding as many dancing girls as possible , playing as much poker as he could , and consuming copious amounts of whiskey . Instead , he 'd encountered the lively Miss Wakefield right out of the chute , and things had promptly gotten out of hand . Oh , yes , from the moment he 'd collided with Chloe in front of a mercantile in Tombstone , chaos had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been better off at the OK Corral , siding with the Clantons and McLaurys against Doc Holliday and the Earps . At least then he 'd have had a fighting chance . Was that the glimmer of tears he saw in her eyes ? Please , God , anything but that . For all of it , he 'd rather be flayed alive than see her cry . " You and I are married , " she said . She held up her left hand , his ring glinting in the crisp sunshine of that October afternoon . Fresh color flared in her face . " Or did that slip your mind ? " He took off his hat , put it on again , this time with the brim drawn down , to cast a shadow over his face . He 'd been over this same terrain a dozen times , walking the landscape of his own conscience , raising all the unflattering arguments that could be made against him , and shooting each one down like a tin can tossed against the crisp autumn sky . And none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The manure pile was beginning to look downright inviting . " Our getting married was a mistake , " he said , in what he hoped was a reasonable tone of voice . For a moment , he was back in Tombstone , a happy bridegroom of less than an hour , with a honeymoon ahead of him , being stopped in the street by a stranger , presented with irrefutable proof that he 'd just been crowned king of fools . " It should never have happened in the first place . " He saw her stiffen at his words , then commence building up a head of steam again . " At last , " she said . " Something we can agree on . I should never have given you the time of day ! " " Go back to Tombstone , Chloe , " he said flatly . " I ca n't , " she retorted , with an indignant little huff of a sigh . " Thanks to you , and that scene you made in the Broken Stirrup Saloon , I lost my teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the president of the school board . That 's why I followed you out here  --  to tell you that you 've ruined my life ! " " I might have overreacted a little , back there at the Broken Stirrup , I mean , " he allowed , but grudgingly . There was more of the old man in him , he guessed , than he liked to think . He felt Angus McKettrick 's pride and stubbornness right there , behind his heart , jostling for standing room next to the coward . Furious with himself for letting Chloe get him on the run in the first place  --  so many people in town had seen him run for his horse and bolt that he 'd probably never live it down . And that was n't counting the spectacle he 'd made in front of his brothers just minutes before , riding up in a frenzy and yammering at Rafe and Kade to hide him  --  God knew what they 'd told her , when she 'd stopped to speak to them . He took a step toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anyway , we settled all this before I left Tombstone . Far as I 'm concerned , you got what you had coming . " She had the lid-rattling look of a kettle coming to a high boil ; he thought the top of her head was fixing to blow right off and braced himself for a steam burn . " You did most of the talking , if you 'll remember , " she accused . " You never gave me a chance to explain ! " He wrenched the buggy whip out of her right hand and hurled it aside . If she went after it , she 'd find herself up to her pretty little nose in horse shit , literally as well as figuratively . " Once I saw your wedding picture , Miss Wakefield , and the man you were standing beside in that daguerreotype did n't happen to be me , no further explanations were required ! " Her eyes widened , as though he 'd struck her , and her mouth tightened . She took back the scant inches of sod she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nose with him . " Please stop trying to portray yourself as the injured party , " she snapped . " You did n't mean any of the things you said when we were courting , and you damn well know it , you  --  you  --  " Guilt foamed up inside him , like the head on a mug of just-drawn beer , but he blew it aside . His jaw clamped down so hard that it hurt , and the challenge hissed through his teeth . " Yes ? " he prompted . She was utterly defiant , a petticoat-Texan , holding the Alamo all on her own . " You used me , " she repeated . " You wanted a wife and a baby , so you could get this ranch ! " He indulged in an insolent shrug , though he was surprised that she knew about his father 's unreasonable demand . " You seemed willing enough to me . " That was when she drew back her hand and slapped him hard enough to loosen his teeth . Rage sang through him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gripped her wrists , to forestall another attack , though there was n't much he could do about her feet . He 'd be lucky if she did n't haul off and kick him in the shins with one of those pointy-toed shoes she was wearing . " You bastard ! " she breathed . " You unconscionable wretch ! " He tightened his grasp , taking care not to hurt her . " Is that what you came all this way to say ? " he shot back . " Well , now you 've said it . Get in your hired buggy , Chloe , and go home to your husband ! " She struggled to free herself , sputtering , too angry to speak coherently . He saw the intention to splinter his bones brewing in her eyes , clear as clouds gathering on a dark horizon , and sidestepped it , still holding her wrists . Her eyes shimmered with tears , and she made no attempt to hide them . " I would dearly love to kill you right now , " she informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Barrett is not my husband  --  you are ! " " What the devil is going on here ? " At the intrusion of an all-too-familiar voice , Jeb turned his head , as did Chloe , and saw his pa standing a few feet away , hoary thumbs hooked under his belt . Angus McKettrick was a big man , well over six feet tall , rugged as the Texas plains that had spawned him , and just then , he looked stern enough to have stepped right out of the pages of the Old Testament . Riled and chagrined , both at the same time , Jeb let go of Chloe with a flinging motion of his hands , not at all sure she would n't take advantage of the distraction to kick him where it would hurt most , which sure as hell was n't his shins . He knew he ought to answer his father 's terse if perfectly sensible question , but he could n't think of a single sane explanation . When he and Chloe were together , they either fought like wildcats or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much middle ground between the two extremes . Chloe visibly smoothed her disgruntled countenance , favored the meddlesome old coot with a wistful smile , and put out a hand , stepping toward Angus as cordially as if they 'd met at a garden party instead of out behind the bunkhouse , next to the manure pile , surrounded by chickens . " How do you do ? " she said brightly . " My name is Chloe McKettrick . I 'm Jeb 's wife . " Angus looked baffled for a moment , but then a beatific smile spread across his face . He took the hand she offered and squeezed it warmly . " Well , now , " the big man said , " my youngest here has been claiming he 'd taken himself a bride , but I confess I was doubtful , since I never saw any sign of you . " After tossing Jeb a look that would sear the hide off a bear , he beamed at Chloe . " I 'm Angus McKettrick , the head of this outfit . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your acquaintance at long last . " Jeb tried to intercede . " Pa  --  " Sure , he 'd let his father and brothers believe he was married , mostly to nettle them , to shake Kade 's and Rafe 's confidence a little , since they 'd been so all-fired sure that one or the other of them would win control of the Triple M , leaving him out in the cold , but it had all been so much smoke and bullshit . Chloe was another man 's wife , whatever her protests to the contrary , and that was the stark reality . " Pa , listen to me , I  --  she  --  " Angus pointed a work-gnarled index finger in his direction . " Not another word , " he warned , all glower , grit , and gravel . Jeb seethed with indignation , but at the moment it did n't seem prudent to state his case . Besides , it meant saying straight out that he 'd been bamboozled but good , and such an admission would have stuck in his throat like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus crooked his elbow at Chloe , and she swept right around and linked her arm with his , leaving Jeb behind as surely as if he 'd turned invisible . The two of them strolled off in the direction of the house , and neither one so much as flinched when Jeb threw back his head , about to split open in frustration , and gave a Rebel yell fit to rend the heavens . It sure scared the chickens , though . Continues ...
