It would rank among sports ' all-time highlights , but , sadly , no cameras were on hand when Candace Parker , a 6-ft. 4-in. women 's basketball prodigy at the University of Tennessee , took on a member of the men 's team this summer one-on-one . At one stage , Parker , 19 , drove to her right and leaped toward the basket . Her opponent rose to block her shot . What followed had probably never before happened in the history of hoops : Parker dunked the ball over the player 's outstretched hand , as several men playing a pickup game nearby froze , jaws agape . A girl had dunked not only on a guy but on a guy who played major college basketball . Her victim ? " I promised him I would not tell you that , " says Parker . " He 's already got it bad around campus . If it gets out there , it 's going to be real bad . I ca n't do it . " <P> One might call this discretion ladylike . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She vaulted onto the sports scene in 2004 , when she became the first girl to win the McDonald 's High School All-American slam-dunk competition , beating two future NBA first-round draft picks in the process . Only three college women and one WNBA player have ever dunked during a game ; Parker first slammed as a high school sophomore . Although her dunks fetch the most attention , her game is complete : she dribbles like a point guard and throws no-look passes from the post , and during one workout , the right-hander hit 22 out of 30 three-pointers  --  shooting left-handed . <P> With more young women playing organized basketball today  --  there are more than 472,000 high school and NCAA participants , up 21% over the past 15 years  --  and refining their ability , Parker represents a new wave of skilled female stars . " Candace will be the next player to change the sport , " predicts Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman . " In 10 to 15 years , there will be a lot of Candace Parkers . But right now there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar high . Young girls will strive to be her . " <P> The sound of squeaky sneakers rang in Parker 's ears even when she was a young child . Her mother Sara cradled 2-week-old Candace in a gym while watching eldest son Anthony play an A.A.U. game ( Anthony , 30 , spent three years in the NBA and now plays professionally in Israel ) . Growing up in Naperville , Ill. , a Chicago suburb , Parker initially rebelled against the family passion , until seventh grade , when her height practically demanded that she take up the game . Her father Larry , who played at the University of Iowa in the 1970s , doubled as her A.A.U. coach . " My dad was so hard on me that I did n't think I was good , " says Parker . Another older brother , Marcus , 27 , knocked not-so-little sister around in late-night games one-on-one . The tough love paid off : Candace is the only person  --  male or female  --  to have won the Naismith national High School Player of the Year Award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
