<p> KABUL , Afghanistan  --  U.S. and other Western officials like to point to Jamila Mujahed as a symbol of how successful the liberation of Afghanistan has been . <p> Within hours of the Taliban 's leaving Kabul a year ago this week , Mujahed was one of the first Afghans to go on national radio and television  --  without the head-to-toe covering that the fundamentalist Islamic regime had required women to wear in public  --  to declare , " The Taliban are gone . " <p> In February , she launched Afghanistan 's first magazine for women . Foreign groups , applauding her efforts , have promised to provide support for her projects . Even so , Mujahed says the reality of her life is far different from the widely disseminated image . " I am in greater danger now than I was a year ago , " says Mujahed , 39 . <p> Other Afghans also say life here is different  --  and far more dangerous  --  than they expected a year ago : <p> * The U.S.-backed government of Hamid Karzai has little control outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is racked with dissension . <p> * Warlords continue to control much of the countryside . Already , several factional power struggles have broken out . <p> * Extremists , in hiding outside the well-protected capital , wait for an opportunity to strike . Taliban and al-Qaeda forces lurk in the mountains . U.S. troops on patrol in search of terrorists in eastern Afghanistan face almost daily hostility and attacks . <p> " The fundamentalists and the warlords are in charge . The gunmen have the authority and the power , and actual rights the government says we have are not given , " Mujahed says . <p> Afghans are waiting for the new government and the outside world to deliver on promises of peace and prosperity . Beneath the veneer of a country on the mend are growing signs that Afghanistan is adrift politically and economically . <p> No two wars or the nation building that follows are alike . But as the White House moves against Saddam Hussein in Iraq , the sluggish and frustrating experience so far in Afghanistan offers a perspective on the challenges of winning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States had the chance to bring stability , economic rejuvenation and democracy to Afghanistan in 1989 , when the U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas drove out the occupying Soviet forces . But once the Soviets were gone , Washington lost interest . A year of peace was followed by bickering among the country 's ethnic factions . The result was a civil war that leveled much of Kabul and ushered in the Taliban and the conditions that led to Afghanistan 's becoming a terrorist training center . <p> Today , graduates of Afghan terrorist camps are spread out across the globe . They are credited with recent attacks and threats in Indonesia , the Philippines , northern Africa , Europe and the USA . Many others are across the Afghan border in Pakistan , waiting to see whether the United States leaves or wears out its welcome here . <p> " A temporary peace always happens in this country , " says M. Akbar Popal , president of Kabul University . " But underneath , there are great , different factors that signal to one group or another as to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Mixed results after the Taliban <p> More small businesses are opening in Kabul each week , including restaurants offering international food and video stores selling and renting first-run movies and television shows . But drug use , pedophilia and prostitution , almost non-existent under the Taliban , have re-emerged with the market economy . <p> Refugees who returned believing there would be opportunities have found no work , housing or safe drinking water . There are few schools . Crime is on the rise , and begging , forbidden by the Taliban , is endemic on the capital 's streets . At jammed intersections across Kabul , wailing mothers carrying tiny , shriveled babies compete with one-legged men for charity  --  a daily ritual that to many is the most visible symbol of the new era . <p> Despite repeated promises by international officials to provide financial assistance and build roads  --  the single most important indicator of economic and political stability and prosperity  --  it was only on Sept. 12 that President Bush announced Afghanistan would get $ 180 million from the United States , Japan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly built a 75-mile road from its eastern border to the Afghan city of Herat , a project that has boosted Iran 's image here and renewed questions about the West 's commitment . <p> " They ( the West ) have said they give us their full support and made many promises , " says A. Jabbar Taqwa , deputy minister for reconstruction . " Perhaps we have been misinformed . " <p> It 's Friday night , and B 's Place , the most popular restaurant in town for Westerners , has a long waiting list . Shrimp flown in from Dubai has been transformed into cocktail appetizers . The multilingual waiter urges a quick decision on the special , Thai curry , because it 's going fast . Those so inclined can start the meal with vodka and tonic  --  real stuff , not something that tastes like kerosene . Just a year ago , alcohol was forbidden by the strict Islamic regime . <p> The murmur of business hums between tables . If it were not for the chug-chug-chug of the nearby generator that keeps the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months ago the restaurant was an empty shell . B 's Place is among some of the superficial changes that have transformed the city that has swollen by a million to about 2.3 million people in less than a year . <p> Tsunamis of bicycles now compete for the shrinking space on the capital 's clogged streets . Even the faces are different . Nearly half of the capital 's women have decided not to wear burqas or have opted for a modified version of the head-to-toe covering . So the eyes and smiles of women , once confined to their homes , have joined the mosaic of the city . <p> " They used to choose the simplest dresses , " A. Jamil , 22 , co-owner of the Zarghone Wedding Store , says of his customers . " Now they are more modern , more stylish and they seem more happy . Now everyone wants embroidering on their dress . And we ( men ) can take their measurements . " <p> There has been an influx of 21st century gizmos and conveniences  --  for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and the price of black-market beer has dropped . Video stores joust with each other to tout the latest pirated copy of a Western movie . A film buff can acquire almost any first-run release , from Spider Man to episodes of the TV series Sex and the City , the latter drawing a large audience of Afghan males whose responses range from stimulation to bewilderment . <p> During the five-year period of Taliban rule , Sayeed Abdual Wahid 's electronics store was one of a handful of shops that had televisions , radios and other black-market items . Wahid , 30 , sold these illicit goods only to known customers , from the back of the shop . Now there are about 80 such stores , and the competition has changed how people shop . <p> " Before they did n't check what was in the box , they just took it out of the store , " Wahid says . " Now they check inside the carton . " <p> Beyond the joy <p> Old-timers say the mood today reminds them of a decade ago , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few months . Stores reopened . People returned to more traditional lives . But then , as now , there was no strong central government or true stability . The country soon fell into a bloody civil war that led to the Taliban 's rise . <p> Hagi Muskin , 93 , who sells bowls , trinkets and water pipes on the oldest street in Kabul , says , " I sit here through the bombing , and I sit through the Taliban and the king and the others and I see how things move . I hope it is too good now to destroy the stability . But things can change . " <p> At the peak of the Soviets ' 1979-1989 occupation , they had 118,000 soldiers deployed here . U.S. and coalition forces now number about 16,000 . Plans to create a 60,000-strong multiethnic Afghan army to provide nationwide security are stalled . So residents worry that the current calm will not last . <p> Most worrisome : reconstruction has not yet started . Kabul has 40 Soviet-era trucks for sanitation duty . Most human waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets and yards . <p> Money to rebuild anything is almost non-existent . Of the $ 1.8 billion pledged by donors at a January conference in Tokyo , 52% has been received . Most of that has gone for humanitarian aid needed to feed returning refugees . <p> Foreign donors have said they can not fund any major reconstruction projects until 2003 . After state and local civil servants were paid this summer with an emergency spurt of funds from the West , many have again gone without salaries for five straight months . <p> Older Afghans are not surprised by the slow pace of recovery . The young , however , still expect to see the promises of prosperity , jobs , health care , education and freedom fulfilled . Returning Afghans live in primitive slums that breed disease and despair . This already volatile situation could be inflamed by a failure to improve living conditions quickly , humanitarian groups warn . <p> Waiting on promises <p> " Need will turn to resentment , which in turn will inflame insecurity , making reconstruction increasingly difficult and future emergencies more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Despite the rhetoric , the donor community has yet to deliver the required funding for Afghan reconstruction . This not only breaks a promise ; it is potentially counterproductive , in both the short and long term . Each month without funding makes it harder for the government to achieve credibility by satisfying the expectations of its people . " <p> For Afghanistan , the United States has pledged $ 296 million for 2002 , part of the $ 4.5 billion international package . The U.S. military operation here , by comparison , cost $ 3.8 billion from November through January . <p> The U.S. military has been slowly shifting its priority in Afghanistan from hunting remnants of al-Qaeda forces to helping rebuild the country . The U.S. Army is involved in small construction projects , and U.S. soldiers will be providing security in some major cities as efforts continue to rebuild the Afghan armed forces . <p> Almost always the discussion comes back to roads . " Why is this so hard to understand ? " asks Taqwa , the deputy minister for reconstruction . " You pay men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the warlords . That pulls the country together . " <p> Roads are the country 's economic and political lifeline , officials say . They make it easier for the government and aid groups to deliver supplies and for villagers to get to markets , schools and hospitals . Not building roads tells Afghans the West can not be trusted to live up to its word . It also invites the Irans of the world to become the dominant foreign force here . <p> Taqwa says the road projects could be completed in two years if the funding came through . " It brings progress , it helps brings jobs . This is not rocket science . But not doing it can lead to rockets .
