WRIGHT Heaven forbid . I would n't stand for that , my dear . FERGUSON You two ladies should exchange phone numbers .

You do n't have to yes , ma'am me . PASSAGE My parents raised me to show respect to my elders . WRIGHT Ok . One thing you need to remember is that this building goes all the way back to the Underground Railroad . Because That 's one thing I 'll be working on with city-council and the Afrikan American Historical Society to get this building designated as a historical landmark . This building is as important to the community as a fire station is. p. 11 FERGUSON See , we got our political connections . With Sun , we got our computer scientist working with us .

Everyone knows the Wrights family in Pittsburgh . Family of lawyers and politicians . Petty bourgeois kneegrows , I call them . Most of them 's mixed bloods , Irish , Indian , Anglos , uppity crust . 500 . Mama Mozella hung out down here in the 3rd Ward . I 'm not say it but anyone can tell Narmer had something to do with it . I 'm not putting their business out in the streets . We just talking . PASSAGE The way she grabbed Narmer 's arm , I thot she was holding on to him for dear life . KHALIFAH Could be . PASSAGE She 's working on him real hard . KHALIFAH I thinks she 's got him . PASSAGE She has some of him , but it 's plain to see she does n't have all of him . KHALIFAH You must be able to see deep . p. 13 PASSAGE I do all right  --  some of the time . KHALIFAH Anyway , they good people . Both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what , almost three years now . Mama Wright 's husband had a massive heart attack and never woke up from the operating table .

PASSAGE Nothing can shock the black off of you . You too Black for that . KHALIFAH You know , I hope we do n't lose this building . Brother Narmer has always made our organization feel right at home here . It 's a nice meeting place . He never gives us any hassle about anything . As long as you do n't cuss and put down Black people , he says we got a home here . The rumors about him losing this place , it scares me . It seems like we can never hold on to an institution long enough to hand it over to the next generation . PASSAGE Start you a church . KHALIFAH I 'm into spirituality and right conduct . That 's how I measure folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. KHALIFAH You still going to let me take you home ?

You never can tell what tomorrow will bring . KHALIFAH As long as you do n't rule the possibility of love out of the equation , I 'm all for tomorrow .

The police up here do n't care who your daddy is , they 'll throw you in jail if you cough wrong at me . GABRIEL I ai n't breaking no law . I just drop by to visit my wife .

Every time I turned around you was doing something to provoke me . PASSAGE I provoked you . Bubba , you was a bully from the day you were born The only reason you got a way with it , because you had two older brothers who defended you and treated everything you need as if it was sacred . Then when old man Smith became sheriff , he was there for you every time you broke the law , whether you got caught stealing cigarettes or a deck of cards or soda , , smoking dope in front of the sheriff 's office ... like you were smoking cigarettes .. your daddy would ... make it all right .... He just spoiled you all your life ... p. 18 GABRIEL You must 've like it . PASSAGE Yes .

That 's why I need you to come back home .. I ca n't raise them without you . Sometimes I feel like I 'm going to snap out like Big Jim 's boy did . PASSAGE Bubba , let me have my kids . I love them . I 'm begging you . I miss them so much . Bubba , you do n't know how much I want them with me . I even began to pray and you know I 'm not much on praying .

You beat , yes , you beat , beat , beat the pure d mess out of me . Yes , I could go back with you . You 're a good enough father , but you 're a terrible husband . GABRIEL But I was good to you some of the time , was n't I ? Tell the truth . PASSAGE Some of the time is not enough ; it has to be all of the time . Bubba , I have no feelings for you . I could do it with you , but I would n't feel a thing . You beat love and sex for you out of me . You almost beat it out of me period for any man . p. 21 GABRIEL I ought a kick your ...

My oarents had more insight than I did I am still suffering the consequences of my poor choice . WRIGHT When you 're young , you do n't have that kind of insight . Do n't get me wrong , I grew to love my husband a lot . Narmer 's not hardly the only man in Pittsburgh . But there 's so few good ones my age worth the effort to fight over . Narmer ' , even at my age , gives me butterflies in my stomach like I 'm still his sweet sixteen .

WRIGHT I 'm scared of being in the ring with you . This is a new feeling for me . I 've never lost to any woman , especially a Black woman . No one feels bad about losing a man to a Black woman . They might when it comes to a white woman . But when you lose to a Black woman , you 've lost to someone who 's truly close to being divine .

Things were smoothing out between Narmer and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart . I felt I was doing everything right this time . Before you came on the scene , I 'd look in the mirror and feel pretty good about what I had to offer Narmer . A couple of weeks ago , I glanced in the mirror and winch at the bulges in my body and I knew I was counting down the years . I was running out of time . Gravity and time were my enemy . The grey in my hair was winning out over the black strands that once shone like the night on my head . I had to turn my full-length mirror to face the wall , because when I looked at myself in the mirror , I was started to look just like my mother at my age .

WRIGHT He fears that since I hurt him once , I would figure out a way to hurt him again . He 's sensitive like that . He carries to many scabs on his heart . I look deep into his eyes and I sense he has no more room for another one . His defenses are too strong for me . For a minute , before you , Sun , like I said , i was winning . Narmer was allowing me to climb over hios defenses . Just for a moment there . PASSAGE I 'm healing him from all the wounds of his life and he 's healing me from all the wounds of my life . WRIGHT Sun , he world is so big . And you 're so lovely and young . PASSAGE Mozella , I wo n't . Do n't make me give him up to your arms . Your arms are too big , too plentiful compared to mine .

Why could n't you 've found find another place , another city ? PASSAGE When I felt myself becoming attracted to Narmer , I asked myself the same question . Honest I did . I know the answer now and I 'm going to keep it right here in my heart . Narmer knows why I came here , because I told him . WRIGHT He shook all the apples from your tree , did n't he ? PASSAGE Yes . And I collected them and place them in my basket . Mozella , Narmer loves my apples , as you call it . WRIGHT When I look into Narmer 's eyes , I see you . PASSAGE Well , I see you when I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PASSAGE It 's the truth . You 're not an easy sistuh to forget , let me tell you . I 'm going home to my children . I 'm triple happy .

And I 'm willing to get him if I have to go under you , around you , over you , or thru you . WRIGHT I 've a lot more experience than you , so I 'm warning you I 'm tough and I play real hard and little dirty on the side . p. 78 PASSAGE Do n't I know it . ( PAUSE . ) Well . Do we wish each other good luck or what ? WRIGHT I have n't reach that level yet . PASSAGE Swirling around and around . I love this Center . You have done some wonderful things for it recently . WRIGHT You 've done some wonderful things for Narmer ; it shows all over him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sistuhs . WRIGHT i told you I 'm a late boomer . Maybe , one morning I 'll wake up and decide to consider one of them . I guess , we could accomplish more if we worked together . Tell you what , girl , I 'll give you a call and we ll see .
