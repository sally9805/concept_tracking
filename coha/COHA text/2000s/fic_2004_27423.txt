When I was four and Cass was six , she whacked me across the face with a plastic shovel at our neighborhood park . We were in the sandbox , and it was winter : In the pictures , we 're in matching coats and hats and mittens . My mother loved to dress us alike , like twins , since we were only two years apart . We did look alike , with the same round face and dark eyes and the same brown hair . But we were n't the same , even then . The story goes like this : Cass had the shovel and I wanted it . My mother was sitting watching us on a bench with Boo , who had her camera and was snapping pictures . This was at Commons Park , the small grassy area in the center of our neighborhood , Lakeview . Besides the sandboxes it also had a swing set , one of those circular things you push real fast and then jump ona kind of manual merry-go-roundand enough grass to play baseball or kickball . Cass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Commons Park , but the shovel incident is what we both always remembered . Not that we ourselves recalled it that well . We had just heard the story recounted so many times over the years that it was easy to take the details and fold them into our own sparse memories , embellishing here or there to fill in the blanks . It is said that I reached for the shovel and Cass would n't give it to me , so I grabbed her hand and tried to yank it away . A struggle ensued , which must have looked harmless until Cass somehow scraped one hard plastic edge across my temple and it began to bleed . Thismoment , the moment , we have documented in one of Boo 's photos . There is one picture of Cass and me playing happily , another of the struggle over the shovel ( I 'm wailing , my mouth a perfect O , while Cass looks stubborn and determined , always a fighter ) , and finally , a shot of her arm extended , the shovel against my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know is my mother , jumping to her feet and running to the sandbox to pull us apart . Apparently , there was a lot of blood . My mother ran through the winding sidewalks of Lakeview with me in her arms , shrieking , then took me to the hospital where I received five tiny stitches . Cass got to stay at Boo and Stewart 's , eat ice cream , and watch TV until we got home . The shovel was destroyed . My mother , already a nervous case , would n't let us leave the house or play with anything not plush or stuffed for about six months . And I grew up with a scar over my eye , small enough that hardly anyone ever noticed it , except for me . And Cass . As we grew older , I 'd sometimes look up to find her peering very closely at my face , finding the scar with her eyes before reaching up with one hand to trace it with her finger . She always said it made her feel horrible to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really her fault . It was just one more thing we had in common , like our faces , our gestures , and our initials . When Cass was born my mother still was n't sure what to name her . My mother had suffered terrible morning sickness , and Boo , who had moved in next door during the fourth month or so , spent a lot of time making herbal tea and rubbing my mother 's feet , trying to make her force down the occasional saltine cracker . Boo was the one who suggested Cassandra . " In Greek mythology she was a seer , a prophet , " she told my mother , whose tendencies leaned more toward Alice or Mary . " Of course she came to a horrible end , but in Greek mythology , who does n't ? Besides , what more could you want for your daughter than to be able to see her own future ? " So Cassandra it was . By the time I came along , my mom and Boo were best friends . Boo 's real name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Caitlin , the Irish version . Cass 's name was always cooler , but to be named for Boo was something special , so I never complained . Her name was just one thing I envied about Cass . Even with all our similarities , it was the things we did n't have in common that I was always most aware of . My sister was n't a seer or a prophet , at least not at eighteen . What she was , was student body president two years running , star right wing of the girls ' soccer team ( State Champs her junior and senior year ) , and Homecoming Queen . She volunteered chopping vegetables at the homeless shelter for soup night every Thursday , had been skydiving twice , and was famous in our high school for staging a sit-in to protest the firing of a popular English teacher for assigning " questionable reading material " Toni Morrison 's Beloved . She made the local news for that one , speaking clearly and angrily to a local reporter , her eyes blazing , with half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , in his recliner , just sat there and grinned . There were only two times I can remember ever seeing Cass really depressed . One was after the soccer State Championship sophomore year , when she missed the goal that could have won it all . She locked herself in her room for a full day . She never talked about it again , instead just focusing on the next season , when she rectified the loss by scoring the only two goals of the championship game . The second time was at the end of her junior year , when her first real boyfriend , Jason Packer , dumped her so he could " see other people " and " enjoy his freedom " in his last summer before college . Cass cried for a week straight , sitting on her bed in her bathrobe and staring out the window , refusing to go anywhere . She drew back from everyone a bit , spending a lot of time next door with Boo where they drank tea , discussed Zen Buddhism , and read dream books together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world around her for signs and symbols , sure that there had to be a message for her somewhere . She got into three out of the four schools she applied to , and ended up choosing Yale . My parents were ecstatic and threw a party to celebrate . We all applauded and cheered as she bent over to slice a big cake that read WATCH OUT YALE : HERE COMES CASS ! which my mother had ordered special from a bakery in town . But Cass was n't herself . She smiled and accepted all the pats on the back , rolling her eyes now and then at my parents ' pride and excitement . But it seemed to me that she was just going through the motions . I wondered if she was looking for a sign , something she could n't find with us or even at Yale . She stayed in this funk all the way through graduation . In mid-June she went to stay with her friend Mindy 's family at the beach and got a job renting out beach chairs by the boardwalk every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was down at the beach on vacation with some friends from the show , and rented a chair from her . He stayed all day , then asked her out . I could tell when she called the next morning , her voice so happy and laughing over the line , that our Cass was back . But not , we soon learned , for long . I do n't think any of us knew how much we 'd needed Cass until she was gone . All we had was her room , her stories , and the quiet that settled in as we tried in vain to spread ourselves out and fill the space she 'd left behind . Everyone forgot my birthday as our kitchen became mission control , full of ringing phones , loud voices , and panic . My mother refused to leave the phone , positive Cass would call any minute and say it was all a joke , of course she was still going to Yale . Meanwhile my mother 's friends from the PTA and Junior League circled through the house making fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and clucking their tongues in packs by the back door . My father shut himself in his office to call everyone who 'd ever known Cass , hanging up each time to cross another name off the long list in front of him . She was eighteen , so technically she could n't be listed as a runaway . She was more like a soldier gone AWOL , still owing some service and on the lam . They 'd already tried Adam 's apartment in New York , but the number had been disconnected . Then they called the Lamont Whipper Show , where they kept getting an answering machine encouraging them to leave their experience with this week 's topicMy Twin Dresses Like a Slut and I Ca n't Stand It ! so that a staffer could get back to them . " I ca n't believe she 'd do this , " my mother kept saying . " Yale . She 's supposed to be at Yale . " And all the heads around her would nod , or hand her more coffee , or cluck again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bed , looking around at how neatly she 'd left everything . In a stack by the bureau was everything she and my mother had bought on endless Saturday trips to Wal-Mart for college : pillowcases , a fan , a little plastic basket to hold her shower stuff , hangers , and her new blue comforter , still in its plastic bag . I wondered how long she 'd known she would n't use any of this stuffwhen she 'd hatched this plan to be with Adam . She 'd fooled us all , every one . She had come home from the beach tanned , gorgeous , and sloppy in love , and proceeded to spend about an hour each night on the phone long-distance with him , spending every bit of the money she 'd made that summer . " I love you , " she 'd whisper to him , and I 'd blush ; she did n't even care that I was there . She 'd be lying across the bed , twirling and untwirling the cord around her wrist . " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Okay . Good night . I love you . What ? More than anything . Anything . I swear . Okay . I love you too . " And when she finally did hang up she 'd pull her legs up against her chest , grinning stupidly , and sigh . " You are pathetic , " I told her one night when it was particularly sickening , involving about twenty I love yous and four punkins . " Oh , Caitlin , " she said , sighing again , rolling over on the bed and sitting up to look at me . " Someday this will happen to you . " " God , I hope not , " I said . " If I act like that , be sure to put me out of my misery . " " Oh , really , " she said , raising one eyebrow . Then , before I could react , she lunged forward and grabbed me around the waist , pulling me down onto the bed with her . I tried to wriggle away but she was strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give , " she said in my ear ; she had a lock hold on my waist . " Go on . Say it . " " Okay , okay , " I said , laughing . " I give . " I could feel her breathing against the back of my neck . " Caitlin , Caitlin , " she said in my ear , one arm still thrown over my shoulder , holding me there . She reached up with her finger and traced the scar over my eyebrow , and I closed my eye , breathing in . Cass always smelled like Ivory soap and fresh air . " You 're such a pain in the ass , " she whispered to me . " But I love you anyway . " " Likewise , " I said . That had been two weeks earlier . She had to have known even then she was leaving . I walked to her mirror and looked at all the ribbons and pictures she had taped around it : spelling bees , honor roll , shots from the mall photo booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looped around each other . There were a couple of us , too . One from a Christmas when we were kids , both of us in little red dresses and white tights , holding hands , and one from a summer at the lake where we 're sitting at the end of a dock , legs dangling over , in our matching blue polka-dot bathing suits , eating Popsicles . On the other side of the wall , in my room , I had the same bed , the same bureau set , and the same mirror . But on my mirror , I had one picture of my best friend , Rina , my third-place ribbon from horseback riding , and my certificate from the B honor roll . Most people would have been happy with that . But for me , with Cass always blazing the trail ahead , there was nothing to do but pale in comparison . Okay , so maybe I was jealous , now and then , but I could never have hated Cass . She came to all my competitions , cheering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one waiting for me when I came off the ice during my only skating competition , after falling on my ass four times in five minutes . She did n't even say anything , just took off her mittens , gave them to me , and helped me back to the dressing rooms where I cried in private as she unlaced my skates , telling knock-knock jokes the whole time . To be honest , a part of me had been looking forward to Cass going off to Yale at the end of the summer . I thought her leaving might actually give me some growing room , a chance to finally strike out on my own . But this changed everything . I 'd always counted on Cass to lead me . She was out there somewhere , but she 'd taken her own route , and for once I could n't follow . This time , she 'd left me to find my own way .
