In what turned out to be the last year of his life , my father slowly lost touch with the real world . There were persistent but not unpleasant hallucinations , such as seeing red birds in an empty sky , or hearing a nonexistent ringing telephone , so that in the middle of a silent stretch he 'd suddenly look up and say , " Is n't someone going to get that ? " He invented a dog that lay at the end of his bed but did n't like to be touched by anyone but him . There was also some mildly delusional thinking . He thought he was allergic to certain words , and if you said them in his presence , he 'd think he was breaking out in a rash . The words all had to do with medical terminology-nurse , doctor , blood , needle . Also certain colors : you could n't wear red or orange because he said they shouted at him and gave him headaches . He also came to believe , honestly and truly believe , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died twenty-five years before in a tragic childhood accident . He was actually confusing it with a real event , the death of his brother Stephen who had drowned at the age of eight in 1936 , in a little river that flowed behind the house where he grew up in Medway , Massachusetts . He was convinced that I was the one lost in the river , that I had been the one whose body was carried nearly two miles downstream and not retrieved until the next morning . He 'd begin a sentence , " That awful summer we lost Peter ... , " or " When Peter was alive ... , " and I 'd be sitting right there in his tropically painted room at the adult care facility , holding his hand , adjusting his lap blanket , maybe spoonfeeding him chicken noodle soup or the plain yogurt he liked to swish around in his mouth until some oozed between his lips like sea foam . Even in abject dependence , my father 's face had this regal cast to it , dominated by eyes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was not a crumpled line but still taut , still elastic . His nose had only the faintest streaks of red vein fireworks . Even his deep wrinkles had some aesthetic and satisfying striation to them , as though he lay them out in precise order every morning . His mind had crumbled , and cancer was starting to eat away his colon , but his exterior looked nearly untouched . He almost looked like the handsome dentist he once was . <p> My visits usually lasted between half an hour and forty-five minutes ; I looked at my watch shamelessly . I could n't wait for my time with him to end , and to that extent the mentally shattered are not unlike the blind-they do n't notice your impatience with them , your outright rudeness . Truthfully , I had nothing else to do , nowhere else to go , but I acted as though I did . We 'd sit by the window that overlooked a slice of the parking lot , sometimes buffeted by a small breeze that came through the partly opened window , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like meditation , minus the inner calm or spiritual destination . I knew he was aware of my presence , that he was cognizant of being with someone , and felt the muscle-memory obligation to hold up the social contract of keeping company with another human being . Sometimes to break the monotony I 'd get out the family photo album I 'd painstakingly assembled and given to him when he first arrived there , comprised of photos I 'd accumulated and held on to for most of my life . We 'd turn the pages that contained photos of me as a child , and he 'd thumb through them with no comment or reaction whatsoever . Just a reverent silence , an unspoken but palpable sadness . <p> " Do you miss your son Peter ? " I might say , to get a rise out of him . <p> " Yes , I miss him very much very very much . " He might steal a glance at the photo of me that was framed and sat on his bureau . I had put it there myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherubic face caught in profile in the artificial amber light of a photographer 's studio , the whole effect too beatific to believe . <p> " What was Peter like ? " I asked that question fairly regularly , just to see what he 'd come up with . <p> This was a typical answer . " Very smart . He knew the alphabet when he was a baby . " Or this : " He climbed on things . He was a great climber . He could climb to the top of a tree and you could n't find him and he would n't come down , not for anything . " He might look at me directly for an instant . " Where are your children ? " <p> " I do n't have any children . " <p> " What happened to them ? " <p> " I 'm not married . " <p> " You should get married . Have a family . Have children . Have boys . " Long pause . A couple of swallows . " Children are a blessing . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You have to go now . I need to walk the dog . He has n't been out all day . " <p> Right around this time I met a girl . I was at a club in the city , one of those subterranean rooms where the light is dirty and dim and you can never be sure that what you 're seeing will look the same the next day . She leaned against a wall near the kitchen , and every time the double doors swung open a brief fluorescent wave swept across her . I asked her to dance , and as I was walking away from her soft refusal , she called out : Okay , let 's dance . I immediately discovered three things about her : her name was Celia , she was born in California and moved to Boston when she was four , and she was thin enough that I could feel the long angular bones of her shoulder blades protruding like wings when we danced . I suspected she was beautiful , and sure enough , when we met for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got a good look at my face , she told me that I looked totally different than she 'd imagined in the dark ; not better or worse , just different . She thought I looked older than thirty-three . And that I did n't look like an architect at all , more like a lawyer or an accountant . <p> I called her every day for a month . I fell in love with her voice over the telephone and with her habit of ending conversations abruptly , with no long prelude or series of false closes . Just click , and she was gone . <p> I started bringing Celia with me when I went to see my father . She asked me if this was my idea of showing a girl a good time-starting every date at a rest home in the middle of nowhere . At first , she hated to come in the facility and would just sit in the car while I was inside , but gradually the boredom and the sameness of the songs on the radio got to her . She finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat stiffly in one of the overstuffed floral-pattered chairs , ignoring the fanned-out magazines , usually staring straight ahead as though she 'd been assigned to some sort of waiting room purgatory . If one of the front desk people tried to engage her in conversation , she 'd act almost catatonic in her responses . Once , she got up and made it to the women 's room , where she nearly fainted ; the receptionist found her on her hands and knees in one of the stalls , trembling and hyperventilating . It got to the point where one of the doctors asked me if my friend was suffering from gerontophobia . <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " Fear of old people . Fear of people who are about to die . " <p> " I never heard of it . " <p> " We see it a lot in young women , " he said . " It 's nothing to be ashamed of . It does n't denote a lack of humanity or absence of empathy or anything like that . Quite the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of seeing themselves as old . It 's a projection thing . They think , That could be me someday . That will be me . " <p> When I told Celia about it , she got really upset . " I 'm not afraid of old people . Why would I be ? You make me sound like some kind of freak . I just do n't like those places . They make me sad . " <p> I tried to convince her to make the walk from the lobby to my father 's room . It 's only about a fifty-foot walk , I said . You can keep your head down so you do n't have to look into any of the other rooms , or see other patients in the hallway , and if the smells bother you , just hold your breath . She got to the point where she made it most of the way to his room before turning back , followed by further advances where she hovered in the doorway , getting glimpses of him . One day I suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she downed one of those pre-made screwdrivers in a bottle in the parking lot and walked right in with me . My father was in his pajamas , bent over in front of the window , talking to his own reflection . " Now that 's what I mean , that 's what I 'm talking about , " he said , wagging his finger for emphasis . <p> " This is Celia , " I said in a voice that was firm but not frightening . <p> He straightened up and walked over to her , trying to be as erect and square-shouldered as possible . She held out her hand ( I told her he liked shaking people 's hands ) , and he took it and right away started examining it , turning it over , twisting it slowly as though he were comparing the two sides . He stared at her face , at the freckles on her forehead , the short blond hair that was n't her natural color but you had to look harder than normal to see that . He traced his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single hoop in her right one , and rubbed the silver chain of her necklace between his thumb and forefinger as though he were trying to grind it into dust . He inspected her neck , smooth and white , offset by two beauty marks set close together like an extra pair of eyes . His face was inches from hers ; their noses practically touched . His palm fell below her neckline and landed , momentarily , on her left breast . She flinched but made no motion to stop him . Eventually he pressed his ear to her chest , and closed his eyes . They stood like that , stiff , motionless , fused together . <p> " Celia , " he said . " I used to know a Celia . " <p> She closed her eyes and brushed her lips on the top of his pink , nearly hairless head . <p> My father had not only forgotten who I was , but never gave a real indication ( and I never asked or probed ) about who he thought I was now . Nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of memory , however dim . Probably he accepted me as a benign stranger , a man visiting him by mistake who was too kindly and courtly to get up and leave once he wandered into the wrong room . I must have seemed , I suppose , like a nice enough young man . He never asked what my name was , and he never called me anything . Sometimes he 'd recognize me as the person who had visited him the day before , and sometimes he 'd say , " That young man who came here yesterday , he smelled bad . You smell nice . " I told the nurses I was his nephew , and after a time , I almost started believing it myself . I did n't want to tell them that I was the dead son because that would just cause undue confusion in a place that already had enough confusion . <p> He dropped stories about his son , Peter , to anyone who would listen-nurses , other residents , the night cleaning crew , guests going by-and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as one he 'd told before . " Once , when he was four , Peter wandered all the way down the avenue , and it turned out he was following a black woman because he had never seen a black woman before . " In the next version , I followed a dog that was chasing a bird . The time after that , I chased a bright red candy wrapper propelled by the wind for two miles until I finally caught up with it only to collapse in tears because the candy was gone . Those stories had happy endings ; I was found at the end . Sometimes I realized that he was taking and transmuting a piece of something that actually happened to me-like the time I stepped on a beehive at my cousin 's birthday party and had to be rushed to the hospital , one of my earliest memories-and other times his plots were lifted straight from the movies or television news , like the time I supposedly saved the family from a raging house fire by going from room to room waking everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year earlier when he was still paying sidelong attention to the world at large . ) <p> Most patients had a running theme , and he had his , tragic but not unique , and wholly believable . He had suffered the most severe amputation a parent can suffer . He 'd lost a child . At least he thought he had . Of course , so had Mr. Myers in B-11 , and Mr. Mericoulas in 6-25 , and just about half the women in the C wing . But my father talked about it almost nonstop ; he could n't let it go . It was his aria . I heard him tell the story of how his son , Peter , died so often that I knew every word choice , every transition , every pause where he pulled on the end of his nose to gather himself . That was the strange thing-it was always told the same way , with the same exact details . An act of pure imagination , it seemed to be the one thing that remained clear and constant to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsure of where his mind was going to go with it , as was so often the case , but because he knew what lay ahead and he did n't want to get there sooner than he had to . <p> It was late afternoon . Peter , eight years old , looking forward to a birthday that was less than two months away , was playing by himself near the river near our house . The river was maybe five meters across and two meters deep at the point where the boy ( dressed every time in a clean white T-shirt and brown shorts , and always described as being skinny as a stick ) stood on the steep , stony riverbank , with water that was a rushing streak of dark dirty brown . It was hot ; it was a supernaturally hot day , the worst of the summer . It was one of those days where the heat breaks you down , makes you do things you would n't ordinarily do . Peter took off his shirt and hung it over the branch of a tree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . He stepped out of his brand-new sneakers and left them under the same tree . ( My father claimed he kept these items , that the police gave them to him once the case was officially ruled an accident . Where he had them was another story , of course , since everything he owned was in the room at the care facility , whether in the drawers of his chest , in the cramped closet , or under his bed , and one day when I was alone in his room , in a pique of boredom , and what you 'd have to call an act of madness , I actually looked for the stuff . ) <p> The heat must have driven Peter to the river . Some footprints , very faint , tracked down to the water 's edge . You could see right where he waded in . Maybe the boy decided to try to swim , or turned over onto his back to see how far he could float . Or perhaps he was trying to jump over the river ; my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illusion that was possible . Once he got in the river the current probably knocked him off of his feet , or maybe he decided to submerge for an instant and got twisted up in the vortex . He was so thin and fragile-you should have seen his arms , the bones were practically sticking through ! - he did n't have the strength to fight a whole river . At some point he was overcome and surrendered . The body traveled downstream , and night came on , and very early the next morning some policemen discovered it floating face-up , snagged by standing weeds . <p> At the end , when he was done with the story , no one would know what to do . You 'd look at your hands . You 'd nod your head sadly . My father would always lean forward and say the same thing : He was only a boy . He had his whole life in front of him . I wish it had been me . <p> The convalescent home , Renaissance Village , was at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like old men asleep on their feet . It was reclaimed swampland , and retained the musky smell and dampness of cold , wet earth even in summer . The building itself had Doric columns and balustrades fronting an L-shaped porch and other nice flourishes to make the families of the residents think they were getting their money 's worth . It was beautiful to behold as you came up the twisting road and caught glimpses of it through the woods , and it was only when you stepped inside that the fantasy gave way to the drizzle of disinfectants and bad bluish light . <p> The first time Celia heard the story was the second time she went into his room . She had brought him a batch of raisin cookies and a loaf of wheat bread from the bakery where she worked as a cashier and , part-time , sometime baker 's apprentice . She put the cookies in a glittering silver tin and put a crinkly green bow on top . But my father was more taken with the bread in its plain white paper bag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing to have in case of an emergency . <p> When he started describing the day when his son , Peter , was playing by himself near the river , Celia looked at him with increasing perplexity and amazement , her eyes opened extra wide , and her mouth hung partly open . She was sitting on one side of my father 's bed , I was on the other . He released the story in one breath ; it seemed to sap the last molecules of energy he had left ; the half-eaten cookie he was holding fell to the floor when he passed out . <p> She pulled me out into the hallway . " What 's he talking about ? Does he mean you ? Are you the Peter he 's talking about ? Do you have a brother who 's also named Peter , like you 're Peter Mark and he 's Peter Paul , or something like that ? " <p> " I 'm an only child . " <p> " So he thinks you drowned ? When you were a kid ? His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know this ? " <p> " I 've heard the story a few times . " <p> " And like , what ? That 's it ? You just listen passively like he 's telling you about what he had for breakfast ? " <p> " He does n't remember what he had for breakfast . " <p> " Do n't be an asshole , Peter . " I loved how she said my name , landing extra hard on the r . She looked up and down the hall and back at me . " It must mean something . It 's got to be symbolic of something . Why would he dream something like that up ? On some level deep inside there must be a reason why he thinks you 're dead . " She was pulling on her fingers , her first nervous tic choice . The mouth scrunching would start soon . " Why do n't you just go in there and tell him that you 're you ? " <p> " You 're talking like he 's rational , like I could just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'd put on his glasses and go , Holy shit , it is you , and we 'd have a good laugh about it . " I was talking too loudly . A woman was scowling at me from her doorway . " His mind is gone . It 's like a bridge that got washed away in a storm . Nothing can get from one side to the other . Everything just falls into this big pit . Nothing he says means anything . " <p> " But you have proof you did n't die . You could show him your driver 's license . Talk about stuff that only you would know about . It might trigger something with him . " <p> " He 's better off not knowing . " <p> " He thinks you drowned . That 's terrible for a father to have to live with . You could unburden him . " <p> " He would n't want me to . It 's his most prized possession . " <p> " I 'm glad you 're not my son , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months after we met and three weeks before my father died , Celia said , " I have something to tell you . " <p> " Can it wait ? " <p> " Technically I guess it could wait another couple of months until you figured it out on your own . But I do n't think you 'd like that . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " I 'm pregnant . " <p> " You 're sure ? " <p> " I think I know my own body , Peter . " <p> I did n't say another word . She later told me that my face did n't even register an emotion , which I said was impossible but she said was true . She waited for me to say something , and only a complete idiot would n't have seen that she was waiting with the look of someone who expects water to be in the pool they just blindly dove into . <p> Later , I worked up all this stuff in my mind . I saw the future with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if fully formed figures were standing right in front of me , the baby with the perfect face of one of those toy infants with glass eyes and moveable mouth and workable limbs , its tiny fingers wriggling and reaching out for me , Celia beautiful beyond words , her hair grown longer and her body slightly thicker and more matronly , touches of realism I added intuitively . In the end , she was wrong about knowing her body . Her period came two days later , which I pictured as this dark red wave crashing over a retaining wall and flooding a whole town . I saw myself as part of the scene , washed away with the town 's other helpless inhabitants and the livestock and any buildings of historical note . There were no survivors . <p> We kept up our visits to my father as though nothing happened . Celia brought him loaves of bread that he strategically placed in different places around the room , and that the nurses later removed for fear of attracting mice . I had decided , since the false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry me . I bought a simple diamond ring in a black velvet box and kept it in my pocket at all times , ready to pull it out when the moment was right . I had all the words scripted out on a scrap of paper I put inside my shoe each morning . <p> The day my father died was all humidity , so thick there was moisture in the folds of the air , but no sun . He had been moved to the regular hospital , on the fifteenth floor , in the cancer ward . It was as though the room was eye-level with the sun , which was trying to push its way through the clouds but the clouds would n't budge . <p> His breathing was forced . He had one hand by his side , the hand that had already given up , and the other one flung through the bed rails , as though he were reaching for something . It was apparent the end was near . The doctor on duty told me to talk to him , hold his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . At one point my father opened his eyes and said , " Who are you ? " For a moment I thought he was talking to me , but he was only questioning the attendant who had come into the room to check his IV drip and change his bedpan . <p> I held his hand , but in my agitated state I must have been squeezing it too hard because he grimaced noisily and tried to jerk the hand away . Celia said , " I 'll do that . You 're too rough . " <p> Hours passed . She started whispering to him nonstop , her mouth perilously close to his ear . <p> " What are you telling him ? " <p> " Just stupid stuff , " she said . " Soothing stuff . " <p> He died during the night . We were out of the room , six floors down getting something to eat out of the vending machines in the cafeteria . We sat opposite each other at a small table , those blue paper coffee cups with the diamond pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to have blackened hoops under them . Her hair had that opposite direction look that comes from holding your face in your hands and then sweeping your fingers up and out . <p> " Do you think he 's scared ? " she said . <p> " I do n't think he knows what 's happening . " <p> " I think he does . I think he knows . " <p> I bent forward , boring in on her a bit too intensely . " You told him that I 'm his son , Peter , did n't you ? " <p> She jiggled the last bit of coffee in her cup and said , " We should go back up . " <p> There was activity in his room , pretty low-key , a few people milling about his bed , and one nurse in a corner of the room folding a blanket with what seemed to me like inordinate care . She 's the one who looked up and said , " He 's gone . " <p> Celia became hysterical . She flung herself across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously injured him-and sobbed into his static chest . I tried to pull her off , but she screamed at me to get away from them both , to leave them alone . <p> A month later , we were at a restaurant , and something was wrong . She stared dumbly at her lap the whole meal , not eating , not talking . <p> " Peter ? " The other sounds in the room evaporated . Everything converged upon her mouth . " I ca n't see you anymore . I just ca n't . " <p> The waiter was standing in front of us about to tick off the list of desserts , and it only occurred to me later , much later , what a marvelous and intuitive waiter he was , because he backed away slowly and discreetly from our table , sensing , I know now , that the thing about to be served up was the shattering of someone 's life . <p> I said , " Would it be okay if I asked why ? Would that be okay ? To ask why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have two different ways of seeing the world . " <p> " Do you love me ? " <p> She bit her lip . <p> " Is this about my father ? " <p> " No . It 's about you . And me . " <p> I tried to call her the next day , but all I got was the answering machine ; I deliberately left short controlled messages that would n't embarrass her if her roommate heard , but she never reacted to any of them . I e-mailed her at her personal address but got no responses until after about the twentieth one she e-mailed back with just a change in the subject line from my " why wo n't you answer ? " to her " why wo n't you stop ? " <p> I had to see her . I tried walking by the bakery a few times in the hopes that she might be looking out the big picture window at just that moment and see me , and finally I went in and stepped up to the counter , but she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter for about two minutes until an elderly woman in a business suit came out , probably the bookkeeper , nervously wiping her hands . <p> " Is Celia here ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , did you want anything from the bakery ? " <p> " Only Celia . " I put my hands on the countertop , to show her , I suppose , that they held nothing to be afraid of . " Is she in the back ? " <p> The woman looked up at the large wooden menu sign , as though I 'd named an item they no longer carried . " I 'm sorry . I wish I could help you . " <p> I took out an ad in the local newspaper . It was n't a big ad , just a little two column by three column box in the personals . The first one read , " Celia , I 'm nothing without you . " After a week , I changed it to , " Celia , I 'm lost without you , " then , finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without you . " It got so that the woman at the newspaper who took the order over the phone felt such sympathy for me that she said that the ad would run for free until I got the desired result , the way you do n't have to pay until you sell the car or couch or pair of skis . It was n't the newspaper 's policy to do that with the personals , but she would make it so for me . I told her that would n't be necessary , that at some point you just stop trying and I was at that point . " Are you sure we should n't run it one more week ? " the woman asked . <p> I thought I saw her , about six months later , in a random encounter in the aisle of a CVS . She pretended not to see me , and buried herself behind a corner shelf of shampoos , conditioners , and hair dyes . It was definitely her hair , big white sweater , scuffed black boots with the side buckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down a parallel aisle and surprised her coming around the corner , where she stood with her head down , examining a bottle of bright green liquid . I took out the ring box , flipped open the lid , and got down on one knee . Celia , will you marry me ? There was this short stretch of silence , then another kind of silence that means something else entirely . I looked up . It was n't her . <p> Even now , sometimes I wonder . Sometimes I think of this other boy named Peter , completely separate from me , another person entirely . I think , What would he be like now ? If I passed him on the street , would I even know it was him ? What kind of face would he have , what kind of clothes ? Would he be rich ? Would he be happy ? Would he find someone to love or spend his whole life looking in vain ? If he had lived , I mean . If he had made it across that river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
