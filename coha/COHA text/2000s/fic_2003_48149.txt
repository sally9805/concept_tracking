That Damon again ! Alfred Damon Runyon 's spirit seems to be hanging over this month 's issue like a gambler watching to see if his six-to-five bet pays off . But while Runyon 's beat was Broadway , Jack Cady 's new story takes us to a little town in Wisconsin with some big doings afoot . Mr. Cady reports that his latest story collection , Ghosts of Yesterday , has been out for a few months now . He says also that two sentences in this story were adaptedfrom The Mauve Decade byThomas Beer ( Alfred A. Knopf , 1937 ) , a book that English teachers do not read , but should . Headnote In memory of Damon Runyon <p> IF COUSIN MURPH HAD NOT expanded his lab , and if Canary Clarence had not developed a glandular condition , then Miss Janice would not have scored a husband . Uncle Willie would not be muttering confused rhymes in his sleep and writing poetry in the attic . Aunt Easy would still be a member of the Temperance Union , and forty duck hunters ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take up crappie fishing . The unhappy mess started on a winter morning when Aunt Easy wakened in her front bedroom , from which she could see neighbors scooping snow from their walks , and four-wheel drives making doughnuts in Wisconsin streets . The house was still warm from wood stoves in living room and kitchen . Aunt Easy shuffled along with her usual , early-morning cheerfulness . Until she hit the kitchen . Pearly curtains with blue duckies hung straight . A clean and greenish tablecloth covered the round oak table where Aunt Easy did crossword puzzles and Uncle Willie read dusty books with yellowing pages . A patchwork cover over the bird cage shielded Parakeet-in-residence Harold from prowling night breezes . Aunt Easy stoked the kitchen stove , made a cup of tea , and lifted the patchwork cover . She found Parakeet-in-residence Harold flat on his back , toes pointed heavenward . Her wrinkled but pretty face went blank . Her shoulders raised as she gave a light sob , and brushed curly gray hair from her forehead . Her worn bathrobe , once purple , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silver-haired , yawned into the room , took one look , paused . Whispered . " Gone to a better place I expect . " Uncle Willie is a Rosicrucian and did n't believe a word of it . " What was wrong with the place he had ? " Aunt Easy was not going to be consoled . At least , not by a Rosicrucian . She had a point . No other place in the world was as nice as that kitchen . Compared to that kitchen , Versailles was drafty , Monaco was loud , the British Museum was stuffy , and Disneyland was a laugh . Nothing , nowhere , was as warm and friendly as that kitchen . Compared to that kitchen , Harvard U. was a muddle and the White House was a mess . Then Cousin Murph showed up . He came fumbling out of the basement where he lived among cages of rodents , antiquated computers , Bunsen burners , test tubes , and flowery little notes from lonely spinsters . Cousin Murph is moderately red-haired , thirty , lean and lank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only bachelor left here in Chedderburg . Come to think of it , he 's also the only redhead , the only mad scientist , and , until he got kicked out of the league , the only guy who owns a radio-guided bowling ball . " Hummm-m-m , " said Murph . He walked to the cage and got his hand smacked as he reached . Aunt Easy could see autopsy in Murph 's eyes . She could sense dissection . " Sorry , " said Murph . " I 'll build the coffin . " Parakeet-in-residence Harold was laid to rest in an intricately decorated box lined with velvet . I had to chip ice and frozen dirt for an hour to make a foot-deep grave beside the garden . I 'm Kissing-Cousin Effie , sweet sixteen , and extra smart . Smart enough not to fall in love with Murph , which is more than I can say for some . Of course , being extra smart , I hang around Murph 's lab from time to time . When the late Parakeet Harold went to his rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school , do homework early , and be at the lab when Murph came home from the bank . He almost always brought a plate of cookies with him ; gifts from local trollops looking for a husband . The problem , as I explained it to myself , is that Murph is just too nice . He tries to fix things that wo n't fix ... like build a designer bird , the kind that cheeps and does n't die . The problem , as Murph explained it , is , " We got ta have birds . You ca n't breed birds if you do n't have birds . Where do you get birds in Wisconsin in the middle of January ? " He cleaned an empty cage while all around us stood cages filled with mice , white rats , voles , and something outstandingly huge . It looked like a hamster on growth hormones . " Name of Janders , " Murph explained , and his voice held apology . " Sort of a mistake . " Janders twitched a nose bigger than a pig snoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamster , was the mistake . " Dimestore in Wausau , pet store in Oshkosh , where else ? " I told him . It 's a good thing Murph has me , because he ca n't solve the least practical problem . Just the experimental stuff . " Saturday , " he said . " Assuming snow 's not tail-high to a Hereford . " He turned back to work on the cage . His lab is helter-skelter , but clean . Shiny counts , neatness do n't . The trip fell flat because it turned into a family occasion . Murph drove his ratty old station wagon which might have once been manufactured by a car company , but which had been improved . It now sported four-wheel drive , and all identifying marks had been removed . From a junk pile somewhere Murph had found a nameplate he 'd proudly soldered to the front of the hood - Maytag . Uncle Willie sat in front with Murph . Aunt Easy and I sat in back . Most cars ca n't dawdle , but we did . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He watched Miss Janice clump along the sidewalk on her way to work at the library ( hours 10-3 M-F , 11-2Sat ) . Miss Janice dressed for the weather and did not look slim . " Picked up weight . " Uncle Willie has no right to talk . Not with that tummy hanging over his belt . " Wearing a parka on top of a parka , " Aunt Easy told him . " Janice is a lovely girl . " Janice is not a lovely girl . Janice is an adventuress . She wears her hair up at work , long skirts to hide long legs , and glasses that make her eyes look cloudy . The minute she visits the lab , though ( bearing cookies ) , the hair comes down , the skirt hits around the knees , and there 's just enough cleavage to knock a preacher out of a pulpit . No glasses . Lovely , my dear : I think not . Once clear of town , snow fences lining the road were banked high . Frozen lakes lay dotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polar wind scoured . " Pretty day for a drive , " said Willie , and quoted something out of Tacitus which made no sense at all . I mean , how often does it snow in Italy ? " ... maybe a pair of finches , " Aunt Easy murmured . " Or a nice canary . I ca n't handle another parakeet . Not just yet . " We all took a moment of silence . Parakeet-in-residence Harold had been somewhat adorable . For a bird . The heater hummed , Maytag churned , and we finally got to the big city . We dropped Uncle Willie at a poolroom where , being adroit at the game , he figured to hustle wintering-over cheese farmers for a few bucks . The sum of it was canaries : Aunt Easy bought one named Sylvester , and Murph bought some breeding pairs , especially a betrothed couple named Sally and Grogan . He also bought something that looked parrotish and South American . Uncle Willie won twenty bucks at pool and caught holy heck from Aunt Easy for sampling local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to work with his birds . The subject of Janice did not reappear . We were all real happy , except for sweet sixteen , here , who was feeling strangely lonesome . Things that winter got speedy , at least at the lab . Each day after work Murph committed science . Everything went fast and biblical . Grogan begat Jonathan and Jonathan begat Peter and Peter begat Cosroe , and Cosroe begat Clarence . Girl birds were involved , of course , mostly not biblical : Claudia and Shirley and Sandy and Tangerine . By the time ice began to break on the lakes , there were enough canaries singing through that lab to challenge the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . And there were women . Winter in Wisconsin makes people want to cuddle , bundle , stay close as paint on woodwork . That lab was infested with visiting babes wearing flimsy fashions beneath ski jackets , and not a stitch of underwear . Lady-things jiggled beneath raw silk blouses . It was worse than the locker room for gym class . " And Murph pays no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telling him about the floozies . We sat at the kitchen table where I did homework and Willie read the witticisms of Charles Sumner . Frost rimed the windows , and from his cage Canary Sylvester cleared his throat . " You 're still a little young , " Willie told me . " It 's the breeding season , but Murph is letting our species down . He pursues a sterner mistress . Murph is all confused with science . " Willie paused , " ... as for the ladies ... young women hit a certain age and get compulsive about marriage . " He looked toward the living room where Aunt Easy was doing something-or-other . " I think I 'll not go into it . " He glanced uneasily out a window . A church steeple stood like a small blot on a flat horizon . I understood . In this town everybody is Lutheran , except the few who are Methodists , or worse , Baptists , or worse , Presbyterian . In this town the only Internet service filters the crud out of everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This town figures it 's the only pure place on earth . This town thinks that Oshkosh is Sodom and Wasau is Gomorrah . Things changed , though . Murph caused it , and did n't even know it happened . When it comes to being a theorist , Murph is worse than Willie , and Willie is almost worse than anybody . " My masterpiece , " said Murph , as ice broke up on the lakes , daffodils sprouted , and he sat before a cage containing a chick , which sat beside a cage that held giant Hamster Janders . " Name of Clarence . " " Did n't know baby turkeys hatched that big . " " Not a turkey . Might be a small mistake in there , someplace . " Murph looked a little guilty . " He 's got this look in his eye .... " " He 'll feather up , " Murph said . " He 'll be buttercup yellow . " Then Murph muttered to himself , something about " You got to train them young .... " Bird training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off as spring progressed and Clarence grew . And grew . And grew . Fewer cookies was good . I stopped gaining pounds and growing zits . Janice still showed up , though . It was either Janice or Uncle Willie who ran off the other babes . A rumor circulated through town . Rumor said that Canary Clarence was only bred for practice . Rumor said that Murph had a contract from the Marines . He would breed a race of giant warriors . The babes , who had more-or-less taken the huge Hamster Janders for granted , took one look at that massive Canary Clarence . They thought of marriage , and of carrying a kid seven times bigger than a wheel of limburger , and opted out . Meanwhile , training progressed . Flight school for Clarence . Murph enticed him from one end of the lab to the other using huge chunks of bird seed . " He 's sorting through his genes , " Murph explained . " He 's too doggone big to flutter , but flutter is what canaries do . He 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing voice , " I muttered . Clarence did not have a pleasing voice . For one thing , he could sing loud enough to shake plaster from the ceiling . For another thing , he was a baritone . " I built in just a tad of duck persuasion , " Murph explained . " When he hatched I was right there , waiting . I was the first thing he saw , and now he 's fixed on me ... thinks I 'm his mama . " " For why ? " " So when he flies , he 'll still come back to the nest . I 'm his flock . " There 's nothing anyone sane could say to that , but sanity is not real big around here , anyway . When word about the duck persuasion got out , Murph was denounced from every pulpit in town . The Lutherans thundered that Murph played at being God . The Methodists yelped about building flight paths to heaven . The Baptists whimpered over the Book of Revelations , and the Presbyterians claimed Murph was predestined for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried to keep a straight face but was constantly caught giggling . " Clarence bothers members of societies for suppressing things , " Uncle Willie said . " I find that charming . " The public appearance of Clarence pretty much stunned the entire town , plus dairy farmers for a radius of forty miles . On a day of sun , and above green , green fields , Clarence rose buttercup-yellow on a summer breeze . He cruised the town . He swooped around city hall . He flapped like an eagle , coasted like a gull , and drifted high above , hovering like a vulture checking out the action . He was a huge yellow streak as his shadow flirted with chickens in farmyards , chased a red-tailed hawk in gyrations through the sky , and seemed searching for the best way to be obnoxious . It is gloriously recorded that he succeeded . Because Clarence , with no spiritual training at all , chose the highest steeple in town for a perch . He was a buttercup-yellow vision of enthusiastic feathers , and as the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up there for the best part of a late afternoon singing , and trying to flutter , and warbling , and pooping . You think a goose can poop ? Well , a goose can , but do n't show me a goose when I 'm talking about Clarence . And loud ? Bull horns are more quiet . Loudspeakers are mere whispers . That bird could make more noise flapping his wings than a Piper Cub racing its engine . On the best day of his life , Caruso would have sounded like a whisper next to Clarence . Clarence made a name for himself that day , and by the time he came home at dusk he had also made a name for Murph . There are those who have always doubted Murph . The Ladies Aid could not stand the thought of an eligible bachelor remaining eligible , when so many solid Lutheran girls were lonesome . The Temperance Union felt that owning lab equipment is evidence of a still . And Janice ( who could have her pick from most of the married men in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am drop-dead gorgeous , " she confided to Uncle Willie , " and I make a tolerable cookie . What 's wrong with him ? " Janice sat at the kitchen table and dealt with Willie . I sat beside Willie and dealt with algebra . " The depth of the human psyche , about which we know so comfortably little ... , " Willie began . " Do n't go there , " Janice told him . " Just give me your take on the problem . " " You work in a library , " Willie told her , " but Murph works in a bank . " " So ? " " You wanta work in a library all your life ? " " A girl could do worse . " " You wanta work in a bank all your life ? " " I think I 'm catching on . " Janice looked alarmed but hopeful . For a moment I almost liked her . " Dear , dear Janice , " I said . " Ah , youth , " she said . " Drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The likable moment passed . " Murph does n't want to be stuck in a bank , " Willie told her . " If he marries , there 's a ninety-nine percent chance he 's stuck . " " I can fix it , " Janice said , and she sounded dreamy . " Gotcha . " And she was out of there . Janice moved quickly , but not as quick as the Ladies Aid whose members demanded that Murph be fired from the bank . That happened while the Temperance Union hounded the sheriff . The Temperance Union wanted somebody arrested , and did n't much care who , although Murph did n't make the cut . Three things came to pass : A new rumor floated through town . It said that Murph had caught on to the critter-construction business . He would build a Guernsey who could yield ten gallons of milk from a mouthful of grass . The Rotary then jumped to Murph 's defense . The Rotary knows what is good for the cheese business , and what ai n't . A sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in red-hot letters-to-the-editor , and revelations about shortcuts in cookie recipes . A fearful number of American mothers were involved . Meanwhile , Murph kept Clarence on a tight rein . No more outdoor flights . After the church steeple debacle it seemed best if Clarence dropped out of sight . Other rumors surfaced . Murph would quadruple tourist traffic because he would a build a real Babe , Paul Bunyon 's Great Blue Ox . Rumor had it that Murph had invented a way to make all mosquitoes disappear from the face of the Earth ; a real big selling point in Wisconsin . While all of this went on Murph fielded questions from bank customers , denied everything , and hurried home each evening to play catch-up in his lab . I felt obliged to help . He was obviously a hunted and very lonely man . By then the lab had burgeoned into canary land . There were enough birds , and many of them strange , to fill an aviary . There was a giant hamster porking up through lack of exercise . Clarence occupied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down other boy birds that started to sing . It was bedlam , and beyond . Clarence was becoming obnoxious . Hamster Janders was n't much better . When I tried to train him to leash he was n't having any part of it . It took him exactly two seconds to chaw through the leash . He headed for Aunt Easy 's garden where he grazed on all of the cabbage . Janders is no bigger than a great dane , but he is n't a whit smaller , either . " I 've created a monster , " Murph confided , and he did n't mean Clarence , and he did n't mean Janders . " The bird seed bills are killin " me . I get no work time , what with cleaning cages . " " You 'll think of something . " But I did n't believe it . Instead I checked in with Uncle Willie . By then june had turned to july and july to August . On a Sunday afternoon when lawns were fried brown and even the trees seemed to pant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading Petronius . As I approached , so did Janice . Janice looked at Willie 's book . " In Wisconsin ? " " At my age it 's the best I can do . " I have to admit that Janice looked pretty good . Her long hair kind of fluffed around her face , and her blue eyes did not look like members of any religious sect . They looked downright ornery . " I 'm taking one last shot , " she told Willie , " and if it does n't work I head for a job in the big city . " She did n't look like someone ready to take a last shot . She dressed casual , in slacks , and no cleavage . " Seduction does n't work , " she told Willie . She turned to me . " Take a lesson . " She turned back to Willie . " I 've set it up . I got enough successrumors running to promote investment . I can put together a Murph corporation that gets him loose from the bank . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a success , and risk capital built him a real lab , and if he could hire real lab assistants .... " Do n't do it , " Willie told Janice . " Worst thing in the world . " " For why ? " " Ah , youth . " Willie rocked gently in his hammock . " Take up the violin . Write poems . Inscribe the story of your life in pictographs . Study astronomy . " He scratched himself behind one ear and blinked upward at tired leaves of an oak tree . The tree sort of rustled . " Science and art have lots in common , " Willie told her . " Scientists and artists expect to fail . They know they 're gon na fail . Our boy Murph is a little of both . " " This better be about something . " Janice looked toward the house , where , in the basement , Murph cleaned canary cages and whispered cuss words . " Because they go for the big picture , " Willie explained . " They go for a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Mona Lisa . Great , a little grand , but not the big one . " Willie also looked toward the house . " Scientists the same ... put together the theory of relativity , then spend fifty years trying to dope out what it means . " " You 're talking about success , " I told him , not a little sarcastic . " No wonder you 're confused ... all those books .... " " And when they do n't even get a Mona Lisa , or relativity , they crash in flames . " Willie reached over and patted Janice 's hand . The pat was grandfatherly , teacherly , and he looked like everybody 's papa . " History is filled with great men who fail , stare at the cold idol they pursued , the idol with dead eyes , and end up weeping while kneeling before a woman and clasping her knees . Great women generally just fall into the arms of a man . You want love ? Court failure . " " Gotcha . " Janice looked ambitious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Right now Murph is sure-fail . Do n't disturb the balance . " To me he said , " Stay out of it . Study basketball or candle making . Adopt a cat . Learn to play harmonica . " But , he grinned when he said it . If failure was what Janice needed , then success would block it . " Garage sale , " I told Murph . " Sell canaries . Sell cages and toss in a canary . Start a canary society . Sell memberships . I 'll handle the whole deal . " I printed a sign for the front lawn . We sold three canaries , with cages , for a tenth the cost of the cages . I thought my idea had gone west , failed , flopped ; I searched for a new idea . Before I came up with anything , we hit big . Of the canaries we sold , one turned out scandalous . A preacher 's wife bought him and waited for him to sing . Instead , he started to cuss . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes , something about Murph installing a dash of parrot . Murph got a little overboard on that one . The preacher 's wife sat cage and bird outdoors while she opened windows to air the house . She even washed the walls . When a mildly inebriated Swedish person passed down the alley , she sold him the bird and made ten bucks on the deal . The Swedish person took the bird to the town 's only tavern where , even today , it charms the customers . Very popular , that bird . Name of Oscar . Word got out that Murph 's canaries were sleepers . We sold out , except for a breeding pair , Jimmy and Cleopatra . Jimmy has a tuft of feathers on top of his head and a confused look . Cleo lives up to her name . The lab returned to normal . One oversize hamster , one oversize bird , plus white mice and other varmints . " Do n't do that again , " I told Murph . I might as well have been whispering in a hurricane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he muttered . " I can regain my reputation . Blue ribbons . Yes , indeed . " I could sense that failure was once more in the wind , but felt helpless . " What do girls do , " I asked Aunt Easy , " when guys do n't listen ? " She smiled and looked around a happy kitchen where Canary Sylvester sang . Aunt Easy motioned toward the living room where Uncle Willie diddled with a radio . " Ignore them , " Aunt Easy told me , " but stand by to pick up the pieces when they crash . " She smiled , even happier , and anyone could tell she was actually fond of Willie . " The dears have to be good at something . At crashing they are experts . " " Even Uncle Willie ? " I was astounded . " Especially Uncle Willie . " Aunt Easy looked both sweet and tender . " He spent twenty years researching and writing a history of Wisconsin . When the book was published he was blacklisted by the State Historical Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , dear , because he told the truth . . . . " Aunt Easy is such a nice lady . She looked at me with real concern . " You 're growing up . You 'll soon have a birthday . And , oh Lordy , I 'm afraid you have talent . " Yeah , well , talent for getting into messes . Autumn covered the land and Murph 's crash , plus the big Janice victory , happened at the county fair . On a day of changing leaves , but with lots of sun , Murph sat Clarence on the front seat of Maytag and put Janders in the rear . About the best you can say is the two critters put up with each other . There were accusations but no fights . Autumn lay across the land . Oak leaves were going brown , the last cut of hay was in , and the farm implement dealer displayed snowmobiles . Birds were flying south , churches held " harvest home " services , and the Ladies Aid quietly bragged of canned beans , canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wood piles rose high as chainsaws roared , and chimneys were cleaned . Yet , in the middle of all this wholesomeness dwelt something rancid . That rancidity came from the Fin , Fur , and Feathers Division of the Brotherhood of Exalted Beagles . That elite division of gun-toters was known , far and wide , as the best justification for the existence of the Temperance Union . The Beagles were generally a red-nosed lot , often glassy-eyed . When Murph arrived at the midway a Ferris wheel twirled , and kids yelped as they rode a baby roller coaster . Rides and booths lined the midway ; pop a balloon , win a stuffed skunk . Colorful streamers flew above the booths of boat dealers , feed and implement dealers , car dealers , and a make-believe Indian selling patent medicine . Popcorn lay underfoot , a calliope clanged , cotton candy smeared cheerful faces ; but then , of course , there was also the booth hosted by the Exalted Order of Beagles : the Fin , Fur , and Feather Division . These are the guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glove compartment , combat fatigues , tattoos reading " Poopsie " or " Mama , " plus an occasional swastika . Their booth was just short of a full-fledged gunshow . The only thing missing was ammo . These guys know each other well enough not to trust their buddies with weapons that work . So , here comes Murph , red-haired , smiling wide as a cornfield and just as corny , towing two cages on wheels and heading for the livestock show . Hamster Janders , overweight and with an attitude , is banging the side of his cage . Clarence sits silent , checking out the action , but with a gleam in his eye that should have been a warning . Fin , Fur , and Feathers were standing in a group before their booth pretending they knew something . As Murph 's little caravan passed , one of them worked his mouth real hard , tried to think , and was finally able to form words . " Hey , Murph . " It was a real victory . Murph stopped . Fin , Fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janders . " Ought to dress out at around two hundred . Be purty gamey. " " . . . ever fried up any of these ? " " Reminds me of my first wife . Looks like her , a little . " You could tell that Janders 's attitude was getting even worse . Fin , Fur , and Feathers looked at Clarence . " This is the steeple-pooper . " " Got to admit , he looks purty tasty . " A Fin , Fur , and Feathers guy stuck a finger into the cage . Clarence pecked it . The Fin , Fur , and Feathers backed up yelping . He still had a finger , but barely . He choked back a sob . " We got shotguns for guys like you , " he whispered , and no one , including him , knew whether he talked to Clarence or Murph . " I 'll be going , " Murph murmured . " Nope , " the Fin , Fur , and Feathers guy said . " You 'll be staying until I wring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better not , " Murph said . " Do n't say I did n't warn you , " Murph said . " Oh , well , " Murph said . Clarence came out of the cage singing . The Fin , Fur , and Feathers guy tumbled on his fanny , hollering . The rest of Fin , Fur , and Feathers stood with mouths open as they watched Clarence become a disappearing yellow spot in the blue sky . Clarence sang anthems as he cruised , and he would sing them again when he returned . Meanwhile , though , all heck broke loose on the midway because another guy had opened Janders 's cage , and Janders was primed . He lumbered down the midway , stopped at the first hamburger stand he found , ran everybody out and ignored all the hamburger . He grazed the lettuce , scorned the pickles , and moved on to the next stand . He clicked his teeth as he worked , and if you 've ever seen a hamster 's teeth . . . well , imagine a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time the sheriff arrived Janders had mopped up every piece of lettuce , carrot , spinach salad , and okra on the midway . He had cruised the Homemaker 's tent , licked up a few preserves , threatened the President of Ladies Aid , snarled at Murph 's attempts to lasso him , sniffed the rear end of the Temperance Union 's president as she fled past , and chewed the tassles off the Methodist preacher 's shoes . Janders then raised his snout to the wind , picked up the scent of a distant cabbage patch , and his bottom was last seen charging over the horizon like a brown and hairy sunset . The sheriff has a sense of humor . In this town you got ta . He drew Murph aside . They talked about payment for lettuce , general damages , and where , by all that is holy , did that blamed bird go ? " I 'm afraid , " Murph admitted , " that he 'll return . " The sheriff looked along the midway , looked at tumult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bottom sniffed . Maybe protective custody ? " " I 'll tough it out , " Murph said . He looked toward the sky . " Oh , Lordy , " Murph said . Imagine , if you will , a massive V of Canadian geese , a V filling the sky from east to west . Imagine the honking of a thousand geese . And high above the honking , the celebrating song of a giant baritone canary calling the shots . Imagine , if you will , a midway in total confusion as children flee screaming and adults stand stunned before a sight that nobody , nowhere has ever dreamed . Nightmares are made of such sights , at least the really bad ones . Imagine , if you will , dive-bomber geese descending on the booth of Fin , Fur , and Feathers . Imagine a gray and green rain so constant that the fastest windshield wipers in the world could not keep up . Imagine men in combat fatigues huddled in a collapsing tent beneath waves of shimmering gray and green slurry , while high above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen . If you 've imagined that , you 've gotten hold of about ten percent of what was happening . The bombardment lasted for something less than half an hour , after which Fin , Fur , and Feathers emerged from a mountain of gray and green , to see Clarence leading his V of geese south , migrating . " I should have thought of that , " Murph whispered . " It 's the duck-gene influence . He 's gone . My masterpiece . " Murph sat , head in hands , while all around him people stood and whispered . The members of Fin , Fur ; and Feathers were also migrating to the nearest lake . People were confused . They had a sense of tragedy , but could n't figure who or what was tragic . They looked at each other , looked for a preacher or a president to tell them what to think . They looked at Murph , slumped before a sagging Homemaker 's tent as he tried not to weep . They watched the bank president approach . The bank president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always well groomed . " You 're fired , " the bank president said to Murph , although his voice was not unpleasant . " Business is business . " Murph slumped further . He stared at spilled popcorn , while noxious odors coasted on a breeze . He did not notice when Janice pushed through the crowd and took a seat beside him . " We could emigrate until this blows over , " she whispered . " Go to someplace new and crazy , like maybe Albuquerque . " " You 'd go along ? " Murph whispered . " I expect , " she said thoughtfully , " I 'd better lead . " She snuggled a little closer . " Witchery , " I muttered to me . " Pretty dumb , " I told myself . Nobody answered . The wedding took place in Oshkosh because there was n't a single preacher in this town who dared to touch it . Uncle Willie , Aunt Easy , and I rode in Willie 's " 49 Studebaker . Janice and Murph piddled along in Maytag . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the Studebaker , or maybe himself , because he sure was n't talking to me or Aunt Easy . " There are elements of epic , but somehow the darn thing is allegory . How best do we handle allegory ? " " Niagara Falls , " Aunt Easy murmured . Then she explained that with Murph comfortably married , the Ladies Aid would leap to defend him . " If Murph and Janice can hold out for a month , " Aunt Easy told me , " they can come home . " Aunt Easy 's eyes shone misty with romance . The wedding did n't amount to much . " Do you take this woman , etc . " " Yep . " " Do you take this mad scientist , etc . " " Yep . " " You 're married . Pay the cashier on your way out . . . . " Okay , so it was a good bit better than that . They had a real preacher and , unfortunately , Janice looked just smashing . Murph seemed a little less confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled me aside . " I 'm worried about my critters , " he whispered . " Trust me , " I told him . " In spite of everything , I have a good heart . " Then I stood and watched Maytag towing old shoes and sprinkled with rice as it became a diminishing spot along the highway . That darned Janice waved a hanky just before Maytag disappeared over a low rise . " It can be done in eight cantos , " Uncle Willie muttered . " Or certainly no more than ten . " He kept muttering all the way home . Aunt Easy sat beside him , but turned to me once in a while . She smiled and gave an occasional wink . Matters were quiet for a couple days and then reports began to surface on the evening news . Janders was seen here , there , always grazing . When he was shot at a couple of times , he began feeding at night . In less than a week he had raided cabbage patches as far south as Peoria , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray cats . Other reports came from down around Redondo Beach where airline pilots reported a giant , buttercup-yellow bird sporting among clouds , and , apparently , singing . Pilots were amazed . They had never seen a bird who could outfly a crop duster . No one else paid much attention , because in California , stuff happens . Our town has settled down as we coast toward winter . Uncle Willie spends his days in the quiet of the attic . Willie forgets to eat sometimes , and he talks to himself in iambs , and his silver hair frizzes , and Aunt Easy sometimes has to lead him in from the garden which apparently now grows symbols . Aunt Easy thinks he 's cute . And Aunt Easy is cute , herself . Now that she has shut out the Temperance Union , she takes a little white wine with supper . When she 's not doing crosswords she does picture puzzles . She and Canary Sylvester hold down that warm kitchen , while she waits for Willie to crash . And I sit in this lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frowzy parrot , two exhausted rabbits who have been fulfilling their duty to their species ; as I suppose Murph is fulfilling his . I oversee three guinea pigs , of whom one seems to be a good bit bigger than he ought a , plus Canary Jimmy , and Canary Cleopatra ; and , oh , Lordy , Cleo has just laid an egg . And sweet sixteen has now become disillusioned seventeen . I think of Murph and Janice doing fulfillment , and wonder if all that householdy stuff is worth a snip , anyway . What I do n't wonder is what I 'm gon na do , because this is my senior year . I 'll graduate and then I 'm just plain gone . The big city . I 'll go to college , or become a poet , or a philosopher , or maybe a biologist ; but two things are certain . I ai n't gon na do it in no attic , and I ai n't gon na do it here .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
