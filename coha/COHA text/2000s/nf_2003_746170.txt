ABSTRACT . The results of most recent studies have generally indicated an improvement in mood after participation in aerobic exercise . However , only a few researchers have compared mindful modes of exercise with aerobic exercise to examine the effect of 1 single session of exercise on mood . In the present study , the authors assessed state anxiety , depressive mood , and subjective well-being prior to and following 1 class of 1 of 4 exercise modes : yoga , Feldenkrais ( awareness through movement ) , aerobic dance , and swimming ; a computer class served as a control . Participants were 147 female general curriculum and physical education teachers ( mean age = 40.15 , SD = 0.2 ) voluntarily enrolled in a 1-year enrichment program at a physical education college . Analyses of variance for repeated measures revealed mood improvement following Feldenkrais , swimming , and yoga but not following aerobic dance and computer lessons . Mindful low-exertion activities as well as aerobic activities enhanced mood in 1 single session of exercise . The authors suggest that more studies assessing the mood-enhancing benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Key words : middle-aged teachers ; mood alterations ; physical activity ; Feldenkrais <p> GROWING EVIDENCE suggests that acute aerobic exercise is associated with affective benefits ( Ekkekakis &; Petruzzello , 1999 ) . Most commonly investigated have been anxiety ( Katula , Blissmer , &; McAuley , 1999 ; Landers &; Petruzzello , 1994 ; Petruzzello , 1995 ; Petruzzello , Landers , Hatfield , Kubitz , &; Salazar , 1991 ; Watanabe , Takeshima , Okada , &; Inomata , 2000 ) , depression ( Morgan , 1994 ; North , McCullagh , &; Tran , 1990 ; O'Connor , Aenchbacher , &; Dishman , 1993 ) , negative moods ( Kennedy &; Newton , 1997 ; Raglin , 2001 ; Tuson &; Sinyor , 1993 ; Yeung , 1996 ) , and general well-being ( Gauvin &; Spence , 1996 ; Hassmen , Koivula , &; Uutela , 2000 ; McAuley , 1994 ; Ransford &; Palisi , 1996 ) . <p> The immediate effects of one single session of aerobic exercise on affect have been assessed using various types of exercise , such as running ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 ) , cycling ( Koltyn , Lynch , &; Hill , 1998 ; Reed , Berg , Latin , &; La-Voie , 1998 ; Youngstedt , O'Connor , Crabbe , &; Dishman , 1998 ) , step aerobics ( Kennedy &; Newton , 1997 ) , swimming ( Berger &; Owen , 1986 , 1992b ) , and water exercise ( Oda , Matsumoto , Nakagawa , &; Moriya , 1999 ) . These studies generally indicate an improvement in mood as a result of aerobic activity . A meta-analysis did not reveal significant differences among the various types of aerobic exercise ( Petruzzello et al. , 1991 ) , and no consistent pattern of dose-response exercise effects was revealed ( Ekkekakis &; Petruzzello , 1999 ; Rejeski , 1994 ) . Significant differences were indicated , however , between aerobic and nonaerobic exercise , with the affective effect of exercise only occurring for aerobic activities ( Petruzzello et al. , 1991 ) . <p> A question often addressed in the literature is whether exercise alters mood , specifically anxiety , as well as or better than other cognitively based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet rest ) . An examination of studies using control groups receiving other anxiety reducing treatments revealed that exercise was no better at reducing anxiety than those treatments ( Petruzzello et al. , 1991 ) . It has been suggested ( e.g. , La Forge , 1995 ) that psychological modalities may use neurobiological pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems . Thus , it is possible that the physiological changes that occur in exercise also occur in other modalities . <p> If one follows this line of thought , one may ask how aerobic exercise programs compare with cognitively based , low-exertion exercise programs ( e.g. , yoga-based exercise , t'ai chi , Feldenkrais , and other mindful exercise derivatives ) in their ability to induce affective changes . These modes of activities combine meditative mindfulness with slower movement or even static muscular exercise ( La Forge , 1995 ) . In addition , these activities require individuals to think about what they are doing during the act , to feel their movements , and to develop awareness of their body and motion ( Lidor , 1999 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on mindful modes of exercise compared with aerobic exercise to examine the immediate effect of one single session of exercise on mood . Berger and Owen studied swimming , yoga , body conditioning , and fencing ( 1988 ) and swimming and yoga only ( 1992a ) . Szabo , Mesko , Caputo , and Gill ( 1998 ) assessed aerobic dance , bodybuilding , martial arts , and t'ai chi and yoga . According to Berger and Owen ( 1988 ) , aerobic activities such as swimming are characterized by the absence of competition and repetitive rhythmical and predictive movements . Similar characteristics can be observed in mindful activities such as yoga and Feldenkrais . <p> Results of these studies seriously question the superiority of aerobic exercise over the low-exertion , mindful exercise modes in altering mood . In fact , all three studies showed greater mood improvement as a result of yoga or yoga and t'ai chi . Although there are many studies that assess the relationship between aerobic exercise and affect , more studies are needed that explore the potential of mindful exercise modes in altering mood states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above mentioned studies ( Berger &; Owen , 1988 ; Szabo et al. , 1998 ) in examining mood alterations following one single session of four modes of exercise . However , whereas those studies included activities that are a mixture of aerobic and nonaerobic exercise modes , such as body conditioning , martial arts , and weight training , in the present study we compared two typical aerobic exercise modes with two typical low-exertion mindful activities . Specifically , we introduced the Felderkrais mode , which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been studied in relation to mood alteration following one single session of exercise , but only following a multiple-week exercise program ( e.g. , Gutman , Herbert , &; Brown , 1977 ; Laumer , Bauer , Fichter , &; Milz , 1997 ) . <p> Feldenkrais is a system of body retraining designed to make people aware of the components of movement and directing them to select integrated patterns of motion ( Gutman et al. , 1977 ) . Through learning synchronous muscloskeletal patterning , thinking and feeling are altered in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing minimal cardiovascular and muscloskeletal strain . The technique was developed for senior citizens and individuals who are not active on a regular basis ( Feldenkrais , 1972 , 1975 ) . <p> In addition , for the present study we chose middle-aged individuals rather than college students ( Berger &; Owen , 1988 ) or young adults ( Szabo et al. , 1998 ) . The benefits of low to moderate physical activity for the middle-aged population are well documented in the literature , from both physiological ( e.g. , Corbin &; Pangrazi , 1996 ) and psychological ( e.g. , Berger &; Motl , 2001 ) perspectives . Landers ( 1999 ) found that psychological health risks such as anxiety and depression can be reduced by engaging in a controlled physical activity program . <p> We had two purposes for this study . Our first purpose was to examine the immediate effect of different modes of exercise , such as dance aerobics , Feldenkrais , swimming , and yoga , on mood alterations in our participants-female general curriculum and physical education teachers . We compared the exercise manipulations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our second purpose was to study the effectiveness of mindful modes of exercise such as yoga and Feldenkrais versus aerobic activities such as dance aerobics and swimming , on mood alterations . We assumed that participation in Feldenkrais and yoga would be associated with mood benefits . Although only women took part in the study , it has been shown that recommendations in this area can be generalized to men . Berger &; Owen ( 1988 ) found that short-term mood benefits applied to both women and men and that both genders were significantly less anxious , tense , depressed , angry , and confused after exercising than before . <p> To our knowledge , the present study is the first to examine the influence of one single session of mindful versus aerobic modes of exercise on mood alterations in Israeli middle-aged individual women . The literature on methodological issues and research designs does not provide specific guidelines on language and nationality issues related to exercise research ( e.g. , Thomas &; Nelson , 2001 ) . However , all instruments used in this study were adequately adapted to Hebrew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physical education teachers who had voluntarily enrolled in a 1-year enrichment program at the Zinman College of Physical Education and Sport Sciences . Our study was conducted in Israel in the Hebrew language . According to college policy , all participants had a physical examination and were found eligible to take part in classes requiring physical activity . The general curriculum teachers reported that they had not participated in organized physical activity programs prior to the study . The physical education teachers reported that they were active during the physical education classes they taught in school . However , they did not spend additional time in physical activity . <p> The women were offered three yoga , five Feldenkrais , four swimming , two dance aerobics , and four computer classes . In the baseline testing , which took place during the second class meeting , 193 teachers participated : 36 in yoga , 51 in Feldenkrais , 35 in swimming , 33 in dance aerobics , and 38 in computer classes . On the pre-post measuring day , which was conducted during the 14th class meeting , 173 participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of participants who completed both the pre-and post-test was 147 ( mean age = 40.15 , SD = 0.2 ) , divided into groups as follows : 31 yoga ( mean age = 37.25 , SD = 10.4 ) , 37 Feldenkrais ( mean age = 40.5 , SD 10.9 ) , 22 swimming ( mean age = 48.8 , SD = 7.0 ) , 28 dance aerobics ( mean age = 35.0 , SD = 8.8 ) , and 29 computer ( mean age = 41.1 , SD = 8.3 ) . <p> Given the applied settings of the study and the liberal attendance rules of the program , those enrolled felt free to occasionally not attend their class . As a result , some of the students who had taken the baseline tests ( i.e. , 2nd class meeting ) were subsequently absent on the pre ( at the beginning of the 14th class meeting ) - post ( after the 14th class meeting ) measurement day . The baseline analysis was conducted on 193 participants who attended the 2nd class meeting . <p> Of the 193 participants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 60 more individuals , who had not attended the 2nd class meeting , did come to the 14th class meeting . Those 60 individuals were included in the pre-post analyses as well . The reason for including these individuals in the pre-post analyses was that different analyses on the 193 individuals and the 87 individuals revealed no significant differences in any of the dependent variables measured in the baseline phase . The assumption was that the additional 60 individuals did not differ from the 87 who participated in both the 2nd and 14th class meetings . <p> Instruments <p> The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ; Speilberger , Gorsuch , &; Lushene , 1970 ) yields separate measures of situational ( state ) and enduring ( trait ) anxiety . In the STAI-Y1 ( state anxiety ) , test takers are asked to describe the way they feel at a particular moment , while in the STAI-Y2 ( trait anxiety ) participants are asked to describe the way they generally feel . The psychometric properties of this scale are well established ( Speilberger , 1972 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 ) and has been widely used in Israel . High values of reliability and validity have been found in the Hebrew version . Tichman and Malinak ( 1980 ) reported mean scores for under-graduate university female students as 33.8 ( SD = 9.4 ) and 38.3 ( SD = 8.6 ) for the STAI-YI and STAI-Y2 , respectively . <p> The Depression Adjective Check List ( DACL ; Lubin , 1981 ) consists of 34 self-descriptive adjectives in both state ( S-DACL ) and trait ( T-DACL ) versions ( Lubin , Van-Whitlock , Swearngin , &; Seever , 1993 ) . In the state version , participants are asked how they feel now , and in the trait version they are asked how they generally feel . The score is the sum of the selected negative adjectives and the unselected positive ones . The scale was translated into Hebrew by Lomranz , Lubin , Eyal , and Medini ( 1981 ) . It has been widely used by researchers in education and psychology in Israel ( Lomranz , Lubin , Eyal , &; Joffe , 1991 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Lomranz et al . ( 1991 ) , mean scores for women aged 23-30 and 31-40 were 8.56 ( SD = 4.44 ) and 9.25 ( SD = 4.71 ) , respectively . <p> The T-DACL was used by Lennox , Bedell , and Stone ( 1990 ) to assess depressive moods prior to and following 13 weeks of aerobic exercise on men and women who were not depressed . Morgan and Feinerman ( 1971 ) used the S-DACL to assess pre-post exercise depressive moods of university students and professors following one single session of aerobic exercise . <p> The Subjective Well-Being Scale ( the Ladder Scale ) is a single-item scale in which respondents are shown a picture of a ladder with 10 numbered rungs ( Cantril , 1965 ) . The top rung represents the best possible life and the bottom rung the worst life . The respondent chooses the rung that represents his or her general or current situation . The scale refers to life as a whole or to reactions to particular life concerns , such as health ( Hilton , Budgen , Molzahn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale is used to assess the affective component of quality of life and has been used frequently with different variations in its instructions ( McDowell &; Newell , 1996 ) , including in Hebrew ( Lomranz et al. , 1991 ) . When establishing the scale , Cantril ( 1965 ) collected norms from all over the world . It was reported that 26% of the Israeli population ( women and men ) indicated Steps 7-10 , 52% indicated Steps 4-6 , and 22% indicated Steps 0-3 . The mean score for the Israeli women was 5.5 . <p> The Eysenck Personality Inventory ( EPI ; Eysenck &; Eysenck , 1968 ) is an often used personality test composed of two dimensions : emotional and social . The Hebrew version of the EPI , adapted by Ziv ( 1985 ) , consists of 35 items : 15 refer to a social dimension ( **25;569;TOOLONG ) and 15 to an emotional dimension ( emotional stability-neuroticism ) ; the remaining 5 items ( The Lie Scale ) are used to examine social desirability . <p> The Lie Scale was reported to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Eysenck &; Eysenck , 1968 ) and was used in a series of studies ( Berger &; Owen , 1988 , 1992a ) similar to the present study to measure the social desirability scores of the participants , as a validation check on their responses . In a recent study , Raviv and Rotstein ( 1999 ) reported mean scores of each dimension of the EPI for Israeli high school students : social ( M = 10.7 , SD = 2.5 ) , emotional ( M = 4.2 , SD = 2.6 ) , and Lie Scale ( M = 2.9 , SD = 1.1 ) . <p> We used four instruments during the baseline and pre-post meetings . During the baseline phase , we measured six dependent variables : EPI ( three scores ) , STAI-Y2 , T-DACL , and the Subjective Well-Being Scale-General . We measured three dependent variables during the pre-post meeting : STAI-Y1 , - S- DACL , and Subjective Well-Being Scale-Current . Raglin ( 2001 ) pointed out the " dynamic aspect " of personality , indicating the need to incorporate mood with trait assessment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality as a baseline for mood assessment . Within Eysenck 's dimensional theory of personality ( Eysenck &; Eysenck , 1968 ) , there is strong evidence that **25;596;TOOLONG is a powerful modulator of mood and mood variability ( Ekkekakis &; Petruzzello , 1999 ) . <p> Procedure <p> All groups met in a 90-min session once a week during one academic year . Group classes , including the computer class , were conducted by a trained instructor and were comparable in the duration of the actual activity , ranging from 60 to 75 min . The women in each class followed the guidelines that were introduced by the instructors and were focused on the tasks . Swimmers swam at their own pace following a warm-up of 20 min . The teacher instructed each participant how to improve her swimming style . Aerobic dancers danced as a group to music , following a warm-up of 5-min of stretching . The yoga and the Feldenkrais groups were the low-exertion mindful activity groups . Both were conducted while participants were mainly lying on the floor . These modes of exercise are gentle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three individuals-a college instructor and two academic coordinators-who were not involved with the classes and were not aware of the study aims to inform the students about the study and to administer the questionnaires . <p> The first meeting of each class was usually hectic and started late , and was devoted to administrative arrangements and explanations about the nature of the course . At the second meeting in each class , students were informed of the study and were asked to participate . Thus , the second meeting was used as a baseline phase . To encourage honesty , objectivity , and precision in completing the questionnaires , the identities of the participants were kept confidential . To achieve objectivity , students were asked to record their true feelings rather than how they thought they were " supposed " to feel . Following the introduction and prior to the activity in that meeting , students completed the EPI , the STAI-YI , the T-DACL , and the Ladder Scale . <p> The pre-post measurements were taken at the 14th week of each course . Three dependent variables were measured during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place approximately in the middle of the course , was select-ed because the continuation of the following class meetings was expected to be interrupted by a holiday period . More important , by the time of the 14th class meeting the participants were familiar with the activities and their demands . They had gained some experience with the different modes of exercise , and thus were able to appropriately evaluate their benefits . <p> It is true that the pre-post data represented the aggregate effects of 14 weeks of training ; however , at the beginning of the program the participants put their efforts into learning the content of the activities and were too busy to gain the required knowledge and patterns of movements . At this class meeting , students were asked to fill in the questionnaires before the beginning of the class session and within 10 min after the session . Results <p> We used a one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to analyze baseline scores ( i.e. , second class meeting ) . A one-way ANOVA was conducted on the age data of all participants according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partial correlation between post-test scores and age , while controlling for the baseline scores . <p> For the pre-and post-scores , we used a two-way ANOVA ( 5 x 2 ) with repeated measures on the time factor . Tukey 's honestly significant difference ( HSD ) was conducted for all statistical comparisons , as appropriate . Alpha was set at .05 for all statistical analyses . Table 1 contains the means and standard deviations on the baseline tests . <p> The analysis confirmed baseline equivalence of the intact classes on six variables ( N = 193 ) . Classes did not differ in any of the EPI measures : social , emotional , and social desirability ( Lie ) . Classes also did not differ in the STAI-Y2 , the T-DACL , and the Ladder Scale . Scores on the STAI-Y2 and on the T-DACL were comparable to norms reported in the Hebrew translation of these tests for women of the study age ( Lomranz et al. , 1981 ; Tichman &; Malinak , 1980 ) . Scores on the Ladder Scale were positively skewed ; however , single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward reporting high scores ( McDowell &; Newell , 1996 ) . <p> We performed an analysis of variance on participants who completed the pre-post tests ( N = 147 ) to assess age differences between the groups . Results revealed age differences , F ( 4,140 ) = 8.6 , p &lt; .001 . Tukey 's HSD procedure indicated that members of the swimming class were significantly older than the other groups . A partial correlation between post-test scores and age , while controlling for baseline scores , was calculated for each test . Results indicated no relationship between pre-post test scores and age after partialling out baseline scores of each variable independently . <p> For the pre-post phase , the data analyses for the STAI-Y1 scores revealed a time main effect , F ( 1,142 ) = 30.68 , p &lt; .001 . In addition , the Group x Time interaction ( see Figure 1 ) was significant , F ( 4,142 ) = 3.54 , p &lt; .01 . The follow-up test indicated that the swimming ( M = 26.41 , SD = 10.01 ) , yoga ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( M = 28.35 , SD = 10.16 ) participants had lower STAI-Y1 scores than did the computer ( M = 31.14 , SD = 10.84 ) and the dance aerobics ( M = 32.64 , SD = 9.8 ) participants in the post-test phase . <p> The data analyses for the S-DACL scores revealed a time main effect , F ( 1,139 ) = 6.1 , p &lt; .05 . The S-DACL scores were lower in the post-test phase ( M = 5.78 , SD = 4.17 ) compared with the pre-test phase ( M = 6.53 , SD = 4.7 ) . The data analyses for the Ladder Scale-Current scores showed a time main effect , F ( l , 129 ) = 19 , p &lt; .001 . The Group x Time interaction was also significant , F ( 4,129 ) = 3.46 , p &lt; .001 . The follow-up test ( see Figure 2 ) indicated that participants in the swimming ( M = 8.6 , SD = .94 ) , Feldenkrais ( M = 8.33 , SD = 1.45 ) , and yoga ( M = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Ladder Scale-Current in comparison with the dance aerobics ( M = 8 , SD = 1.47 ) and computer classes ( M = 7.54 , SD = 1.44 ) participants . Discussion <p> The purpose of our study was to examine the effectiveness of four different physical activity modes ( dance aerobics , Feldenkrais , swimming , and yoga ) on mood alterations of general curriculum and physical education teachers enrolled in a college enrichment program . We compared the physical activity modes with a nonactivity ( a computer class ) . The main assumption was that the nonaerobic mindful activities would affect mood alterations as positively as aerobic activities . <p> The results obtained in this study are consistent with previous results ( Berger &; Owen , 1988 , 1992a ; Szabo et al. , 1998 ) indicating the ability of mindful low exertion activities to enhance mood in one single session of exercise and call into question the superiority of aerobic exercise over nonaerobic mindful modes in altering mood states ( Petruzzello et al. , 1991 ) . <p> Results of the Group x Time interactions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Feldenkrais , swimming , and yoga classes demonstrated lower scores of state anxiety than the dance aerobics and computer participants . Improvement in the subjective well-being measures was also observed in the Feldenkrais , swimming , and yoga participants . <p> Although mindful activities share a focus on breathing awareness , self-regulation , the practice of conscious relaxation of muscles , and internal awareness with other therapeutic modalities ( e.g. , meditation , relaxation ) , they also share with aerobic exercise the repetitive and rhythmical movements , the closed or predictable activities , the absence of interpersonal competition , and the abdominal and rhythmical breathing ( Berger &; Motl , 2000 ) . In support of Berger and Owen ( 1988 ) and Szabo et al . ( 1998 ) , our results suggest that repetitive , low-exertion rhythmical movements that are cognitively based may be more powerful in immediate mood enhancement than high intensity rhythmical movements that are not cognitively focused . <p> Specifically , this study introduced the Feldenkrais activity , adding credence to the ability of the mindful activities to produce mood changes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined only in a multi-session program ( Gutman et al. , 1977 ; Laumer et al. , 1997 ) . This technique was also shown to be effective in one single session of exposure to physical activity . <p> Results of the present study are also in agreement with Berger and Owen ( 1988,1992b ) on the ability of swimming to alter mood . As in those studies , it is not clear whether the affective change is a result of the aerobic effect , the relaxing water environment ( Koltyn &; Morgan , 1992 ; Oda et al. , 1999 ) , or a combination of both . In addition , the positive effects of swimming might have occurred because of some inherent mindfulness implicit in the act of swimming , perhaps stroke regulation and movement against resistance . <p> Aerobic dance was not associated with mood benefits in our study . These results are not in line with previous study results providing evidence for mood-enhanced benefits of this physical mode of exercise ( Berger &; Owen , 1998 ; Kennedy &; Newton , 1997 ; Morris &; Salmon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Reed et al. , 1998 ; Youngstedt et al. , 1998 ) . We assumed that the participants in the present study may not have benefitted from this activity because they were older than participants in the previous studies . Although they were actively involved in the program , they might have felt that this activity required too much energy and physical involvement . <p> It is important to keep in perspective that the participants in this study , similar to previous studies ( Berger &; Owen , 1988 , 1992b , 1998 ; Motl et al. , 2000 ; Szabo et al. , 1998 ) were self-selected volunteers who had prior expectations related to the benefits of their chosen exercise , which in turn may have influenced the post-exercise affect . In other words , the participants chose their exercise modality by signing up for that particular class activity . In addition , the applied setting reflected real-life conditions that occur in most exercise classes and demonstrated a more accurate view of the relationship between mood and exercise than is possible in a laboratory setting ( Berger &; Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reflection of another perspective , one may note a few review articles that have discussed the different neurobiologic mechanisms that explain the relationship between exercise ( mostly aerobic ) and affect ( Dishman &; Jackson , 2000 ; Ekkekakis &; Petruzzello , 1999 ; La Forge , 1995 ; Netz &; Jacob , 1994 ; Petruzzello et al. , 1991 ; Raglin , 2001 ) . None of these articles , however , looked into the possible mediating mechanism between mindful exercise , like yoga or Feldenkrais , and affect . For example , La Forge suggested that the same psychological changes occur in those modalities and in aerobic exercise . However , how can maintaining a physical posture , frequently with significant isometric tension , induce the neurophysiology of the inwardly directed mindfulness experienced in yoga or Feldenkrais ? This question has not been asked ( La Forge ) . <p> The S-DACL scores reflected an improvement in all groups . It is assumed that this occurred because the DACL was sensitive enough to indicate mood alterations after only a single session of any kind of activity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low-intensity activity with an emphasis on proprioceptive awareness on mood alterations with more commonly examined exercise modes . Given the increasing popularity of mindful activities such as yoga and Feldenkrais , more studies are needed to examine the contribution of such activities to the body and mind . Another challenge is to determine the differences in the neurobiologic mechanisms that underlie affective changes brought on by aerobic exercise versus therapeutic modalities or versus mindful activities . <p> Address correspondence to Yael Netz , School of Physical Education , The Zinman College of Physical Education and Sport Sciences , Wingate Institute , 42902 Israel ; **26;623;TOOLONG .
