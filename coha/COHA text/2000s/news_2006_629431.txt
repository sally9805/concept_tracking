Dotcom I was most grateful for the article by George M. Anderson , SJ. , about my play and DVD about Dorothy Day , " Fool for Christ " ( Of Many Things , 11/3 ) , but there was a misprint that I diink needs to be noted . The last part of my Web site address was given incorrecdy . It should have read www.foolforchrist.com . Sarah Melici Red Bank , N.J. A Third Way Melanie Morey and John Piderit , S.J. , have once again called for dramatic action to ensure die vitality of a distincdy Catholic education in our Catholic colleges and universities . ( " Identity Crisis , " 10/13 ) . In their view , participants in the discussion are divided between those who are basically content with initiatives in place and those who are not and thus are worried about the future . There is actually a third ( and growing ) alternative : those who are fully aware of the complexities and difficulties of the task but are working hard and creatively to foster the Catholic and congregational identity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as colleagues and want to applaud their good work as they explore new and increasingly effective strategies , programs , collaborative efforts and assessment tools . They are hardly complacent in their task but are busily forging an intentional identity in a complex , pluralistic culture that challenges their best efforts . I agree with Morey and Piderit mat congregational identity ( Mercy , Franciscan , Benedictine , Jesuit and so on ) should not trump Cadiolic identity . We need to foster both . This is increasingly being done , as congregational heritages are celebrated at the same time that Catholic intellectual and social traditions are promoted . Clearly , there is much more to be done , but we need to acknowledge the good work that is already underway . Charles L. Currie , S.J. President , Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities Washington , D.C. Symbolic Logic I found " Identity Crisis " by Melanie Morey and John Piderit , SJ. ( 10/13 ) informative , with many good suggestions . However , as a Cadiolic high school teacher of 25 years , I was struck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article . Maybe higher education can learn from grammar school and high school teachers , who decorate their classrooms with crucifixes , icons , prayer symbols and messages of hope in order to foster a Catholic environment . Why not plaster the walls with the witness of Oscar Romero , Dorothy Day , Cesar Chavez , Sister Thea Bowman , the holy oudaw Berrigan brothers , Father Damien the Leper , Mother Seton and more ? Let classrooms , halls and dormitories cry out for peace and justice , and let entire campuses celebrate our living , loving God . Ken Cooper Washington , D.C. Out of Context It is indeed encouraging that the dialogue about the Catholic identity of our colleges and universities continues . But in the interest of accuracy in reporting , I wish to correct a statement in the article by Melanie Morey and John Piderit , SJ . ( " Identity Crisis , " 10/13 ) . The authors quote me as having written in my book , Negotiating Identity ( 2000 ) , that many faculty members " are ignorant of , indifferent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these institutions . " I was quoting Msgr . John F. Murphy , my predecessor in the office of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities . He wrote it in a memo for the Committee on Purpose and Identity of the A.C.C.U. in 1974 , and it needs to be read in that context . A great deal of attention was given to the identity question between 1974 and 2000 , and Morey and Piderit themselves cite many of the efforts made on campuses today to define their Catholic mission in the 21st century . Context remains important . Alice Gallio , O.S.U. Scholar in Residence College of New Rochelle New Rochelle , N.Y . Atonement and Obedience I thoroughly enjoy the articles in America by William J. O'Malley , S.J. He brings down-to-earth warmth to difficult topics . In " Forgiving God " ( 9/22 ) , however , his reflections on suffering are helpful until the final section on Jesus ' passion , where he contrasts the God revealed in Jesus ' kind acceptance and treatment of sinners with " a vindictive God who demands blood in recompense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom ) eating one piece of fruit . " It might help to understand the Father not as wanting the death of Jesus , but wanting his faithfulness and obedience continuing through a most difficult life ended by crucifixion . A good general does not want the death of his troops , but may be vailing to send them into harm 's way in order to achieve a necessary victory . He issues a command and hopes they obey . He grieves if they die , but he does not regret sending them . Jesus ' whole obedient life and resurrection , not just his death , atones for the disobedience and rebellion of the human race , beginning with our first ancestors . A faithful and obedient life , with its unbalanced mixtures of joy and suffering , is all the Lord seems to want from all of us . ( Rev. ) Joseph A. Gagnon Marysville , Mich . Spreading the Word The Of Many Things column by Drew Christiansen , S.J. ( 10/20 ) , asked : " But why do the bishops today not seem prophetic on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He cited the lack of media exposure and unrealistic expectations . A major reason he did not mention is the bishops ' reluctance to promote Catholic social teaching , which remains the church 's " best kept secret . " How many times , for example , have we read in diocesan papers about the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church or other specific social teachings , some of which were issued by our own bishops ' conference ? Francis X. Doyle Ashbum , Va . Cooperating With Evil I was very disappointed with your Oct. 27 issue . While many of your writers seemed to revel in all sorts of moral gymnastics to convince us that it was permissible to vote for evil , they failed to discuss what may be a more appropriate response to our dysfunctional political system : a refusal to cooperate and participate . Did Dorothy Day have no effect on our American Catholic thinking ? This egregious error was compounded by the beautiful essay " Dragen , Here Is Your Letter , " by Lyn Burr Brignoli ( 10/27 ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the essay extolled the gifts of Dragen , a person with Down syndrome , when such people are part of a dying class . Genocide by abortion perhaps ? Are we Americans willing to dance with the devil and support our broken political machinery just so we can wear a sticker that proclaims " I voted " ? Shame on us for our willingness to compromise our beliefs and participate in the destruction of future Dragens . Until we are willing to admit that the system is corrupted beyond repair-as Dorothy Day pointed out so long ago-and to build anew , there will be no systemic change and fewer and fewer Dragens to bless us with their wisdom . ( Rev. ) Michael Mayer Rochester , N.Y . Still Not Equal Elinor Nauen ( " A Sporting Chance , " 10/20 ) did a great job explaining the history and background of Tide IX , which has certainly done much for gender equality in sports . Yet another article in the same issue illustrates how much further women 's sports still has to go until it might truly be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave Anderson commented on the popularity of soccer in the international community , but noted mat until the United States wins or gets to the finals of the World Cup , baseball , football and other sports will dominate in the United States . I would like to let Mr. Anderson know the United States has an excellent international record . In five World Cup competitions the United States won two tides and three third-place finishes , and in four Olympics the tally is three golds ( including 2008 ) and one silver . These are of course the results of the U.S. women 's soccer team . Scott Baietti Albany , N.Y . There Are No Accidents Coincidences are just that , are n't they ? But when I recendy received the issue of America that spoke of the nexus of our faith with sports ( " The Soul of Sports , " 10/20 ) , my daughter the same day supplied me with an e-mail purporting to be a dictionary for Catholics . Among its entries was this : " Jesuits : an order of priests known for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a Xavier University alumnus , I found all this intriguing . Justin G.
