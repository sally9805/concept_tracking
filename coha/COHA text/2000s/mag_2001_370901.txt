As a boy growing up in Lake Arrowhead , Calif. , in the 1950s , Tim White used to collect obsidian flakes and pottery shards at ancient Indian campsites in the nearby San Bernardino Mountains . ( He also amassed a menagerie of lizards and snakes , much to his mother 's dismay . ) Told by a high school guidance counselor that his dream of studying dinosaurs was unacceptable , White headed to the University of California , Riverside , to major in biology  --  and eventually anthropology as well . He spent his weekends catching rattlesnakes . <P> But he never lost his childhood fascination with prehistory , and today he is one of the world 's leading collectors and interpreters of hominid fossils in the grand tradition of the Leakey family , with whom he has cooperated and competed over several decades . Since 1981 he has co-directed a research project in Ethiopia that has pushed back the story of human evolution more than 2 million years , to the moment in prehistory when humans separated from the chimpanzees , our closest kin . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Michigan in 1974 when he landed a plum summer job doing fieldwork with Richard Leakey 's team at Koobi Fora , Kenya . He spent three seasons there and so impressed his boss that when Mary Leakey needed someone to describe the hominid fossils she had found at Laetoli , Tanzania , her son recommended White . Later , White helped excavate Laetoli 's famous trails of hominid footprints . <P> By age 28 , White was ready to redraw the human family tree . He had just joined the faculty at the University of California , Berkeley , where he remains today , and was collaborating with Donald Johanson , the discoverer of the Lucy skeleton . Together they proposed a controversial  --  but now widely accepted  --  restructuring of our evolutionary heritage , based on a recently discovered species that the two scientists had named and described . In the early 1990s , White and his colleagues found what was then the oldest known human ancestor , 4.4 million-year-old Ardipithecus ramidus ; its bones and teeth provided the first hint that humans began to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most experts believed . Several years later , White and his team unearthed yet another creature , 2.5 million-year-old Australopithecus garhi , which filled a crucial gap in the human lineage and was associated with the earliest evidence of butchering animals . <P> Meticulous and skeptical to a fault , White often takes years to analyze and publish the results of his fieldwork . ( He is still piecing together a ramidus skeleton that was discovered in 1995 . ) " He 's the most exacting person I 've ever met , " says Kent State anthropologist C. Owen Lovejoy with a sigh . " But that 's what has made him so successful . He finds stuff that no one else can find and trains students in ways that no one else does . His energy and devotion are limitless , 24 hours a day . " <P> Ultimately , White says , he would like to be remembered not so much for his discoveries as for the way he made them . " One of the things I 'm most proud of is the high-level involvement of Africans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next generation , " he explains . " I consider these resources  --  fossils and fossil sites  --  to be really endangered . They are fragile erosional systems , and the fact is , you get only one shot to do this right . When you work at a site , you alter it forever . "
