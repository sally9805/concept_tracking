The Canterbury Papers A Novel of Suspense Chapter One The Courier Lady Eleanor was my stepmother , and the dearest friend of my childhood . To everyone else she was Queen Eleanor of England , or the Duchess of Aquitaine , or " Your Highness . " To me she was simply the Lady Eleanor . Our long and complicated history had many bends in the road , and our early intimacy had long since disappeared from view . Even so , it was hard to imagine that she meant me bodily harm . But there was no doubt in my mind that my current situation could be traced directly to the letter Queen Eleanor had sent to my brother 's Paris court not a fortnight earlier . Philippe and I were closeted together when her letter arrived . We were in his private chambers in our drafty palace on the le de la Cit , perched on the edge of the wind-whipped Seine , when the courier found us . We were alone , without guards or servants , as was usual when he wished to badger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alas , " I recall him saying , " I have hesitated to speak to you about this , but your behavior is becoming more and more a daily topic of discussion for the court . " With hands clasped behind his back , he paced away from me as he talked , so that his words at the end became muffled as if flung against the wind . I sighed . The chamber suited Philippe . His passion was war , always had been . The tapestries that lined the high stone walls and provided some measure of warmth were laced with hunting scenes  --  men with spears , boars in flight , hounds leaping . Hunting is , after all , a form of war ; at least I would think so if I were an animal . The doors that guarded the privacy of the chamber were of oak and carved with scenes from the ancient battle of Troy . Encircling the hearth was another remarkable piece of oak carved by highly skilled artisans . They had used their art to design miniature weapons  --  bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain of malicious grapes winding around the gentle hearth fire . " Well , what do you have to say , sister ? " He turned unexpectedly and headed back in my direction . I forced my attention to the issue . " I can not understand , brother , why the court should gossip about me in this way . Unless it is that your courtiers are envious of my serenity in the midst of the tremendous chaos that reigns over this impending wedding . " " They say not that you are serene . " Philippe 's toe stubbed on a corner of one of the Smyrna carpets of which he was so proud . He cursed softly as he caught himself . At such vulnerable moments , he was not the king of France to me . I saw him only as my younger brother . " The reports are the reverse , that your feeling about this wedding runs high . The charge is that you refuse to take part in the preparations , or even give advice when it is sought , but instead become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their plans . " He began to rub his brow , always a sign that his headaches were returning , then covered the gesture by running his fingers through his dark , cropped hair . " Alas , this is becoming an issue between Agns and my royal self . She feels you are not supportive of this coming wedding between our son and the house of the Plantagenet . " I held back yet another sigh . Philippe felt caught ; I could see it in his face . I knew he did not want to have this conversation with me , that Agns had forced it on him . We cared for each other , and he mostly left me alone to brood in my own way or withdraw if it suited me . For all his faults , he was my brother . I sometimes saw in his face the broader outlines of my own as it played back to me from the metal mirror he himself had brought me from the south . We had different mothers , but the lines and shapes of our faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared , and we had the same slightly almond-shaped eyes , those eyes of the Capet house of France . His were dark , while I had been told mine were as green as the eyes of my black cat . " Philippe , try to understand my position . " I shifted on the cushions to lean forward and made a gesture of appeal with my good hand . " I do n't like weddings . I do n't want any part of them . I am delighted that you have arranged this marriage between little Louis and Eleanor 's granddaughter . " I smiled but then spoiled it by muttering , " Although why Eleanor of Castile would want to send the child Blanche from sunny Spain north to the damp fog of Paris is beyond me . " Philippe stopped in front of the small couch on which I had draped myself . " That is exactly the kind of comment that  --  " "  --  that gets me in trouble in this court of yours , " I finished for him . It was so easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were so predictable . " It 's your court as well , Alas , " he said , sounding wounded . " No , it ' s not , Philippe . Let 's notat least between us when we are alone  --  keep up that fiction . I am here at your sufferance . I was sent back here like an unwanted package when my betrothal to Richard ended and Queen Eleanor found me an embarrassment . You are kind , but I am of an age where I should have my own home and county , and a husband of my own . I do n't , and so I find myself your guest . " I tried to speak in a matter-of-fact manner but found my voice oddly giving way to some kind of shakiness as I finished . So I stopped talking until I had more possession of myself .
