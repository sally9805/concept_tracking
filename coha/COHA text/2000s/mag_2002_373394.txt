The story of Adrian Monk  --  the protagonist of the hit detective show on the USA cable network  --  is not unlike the story of Monk the series . Monk , played by Tony Shalhoub , is a brilliant detective with a few quirks : after his wife was murdered , he developed obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . Now he 's germ phobic and afraid of heights  --  and milk . He can ID a criminal with little more than a sniff of the curtains at a murder scene , but put him near a couch with a crooked pillow , and he ca n't function until he straightens it . Because of his condition , he was fired from the San Francisco police force . Yet when a tough case comes up , his former colleagues keep calling him back to save their heinies . <P> Monk the series was also let go from the big leagues . It was developed for ABC , which passed on this charming but quirky comedy-drama . But now that Monk is a hit on cable  --  and ABC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opinion of the series has improved . The network exercised a clause that gave it the right to rerun the show , and it 's now airing Monk repeats Tuesdays at 9 p.m . E.T . <P> It 's common for network shows to cut rerun deals on cable ( the Law &; Order family , 24 ) . But Monk 's reverse trip shows how business has changed for ABC and TV as a whole . Monk was in development at ABC back in the heyday of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , which now seems as quaint a turn-of-the-century phenomenon as gains on one 's 401(k) . Since then , the network has tumbled from first place to fourth in the ratings , and it has started looking outside for help . Earlier this month , it made a production deal with HBO ( owned by TIME 's parent company , AOL Time Warner ) . The Monk " experiment , " says ABC Entertainment president Susan Lyne , provides ABC with only slightly used programming on the cheap and benefits Disney , ABC 's parent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " this is a great way of doing business . " Monk 's ABC debut drew more than 7 million viewers  --  pretty good for a summer rerun and huge by cable standards . <P> The Monk move is also a sign of how the status lines between cable and broadcast TV have faded . Recently , most of TV 's acclaimed , successful new dramas have debuted on cable ( The Shield , Six Feet Under ) , while the networks ' new success stories  --  The Bachelor , American Idol , Dog Eat Dog  --  are reality shows that might once have gone to cable . Says usa president Doug Herzog : " Cable is not the sorry sister or the B team . We can create first-rate programming . " <P> Indeed , Monk ( which airs on USA Fridays at 10 p.m . E.T. ) is the kind of distinctive , fresh series that the big networks could make but rarely do . It 's a lighthearted whodunit  --  think of ' 70s shows like The Rockford Files  --  but with added sophistication and poignance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Shalhoub almost did n't take the part . " I liked the script , " he says , " but I did n't see myself doing it . " His manager told him to take a second look . " She was trying to tell me in a covert way that it was well suited to me . " She was right . There 's a touch of sweet-hearted madness in many of his characters , from the perfectionist chef in Big Night to Wings ' goofily hapless cabbie Antonio . Where another actor would have made Monk Keerrraazy with a capital K , Shalhoub portrays him with cool-jazz reserve as a Woody Allenish nerd , which makes the character both funnier and more affecting .
