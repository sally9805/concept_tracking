Chapter 1The world is full of broken people . Splints , casts , miracle drugs , and time ca n't mend fractured hearts , wounded minds , torn spirits . Currently , sunshine was Micky Bellsong 's medication of choice , and southern California in late August was an apothecary with a deep supply of this prescription . Tuesday afternoon , wearing a bikini and oiled for broiling , Micky reclined in a lounge chair in her aunt Geneva 's backyard . The nylon webbing was a nausea-inducing shade of green , and it sagged , too , and the aluminum joints creaked as though the lawn furniture were far older than Micky , who was only twenty-eight , but who sometimes felt ancient . Her aunt , from whom fate had stolen everything except a reliable sense of humor , referred to the yard as " the garden . " That would be the rosebush . The property was wider than it was deep , to allow the full length of the house trailer to face the street . Instead of a lawn with trees , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , a strip of grass extended from one side of the lot to the other , but it provided a scant twelve feet of turf between the door and the rear fence . The grass flourished because Geneva watered it regularly with a hose . The rosebush , however , responded perversely to tender care . In spite of ample sunshine , water , and plant food , in spite of the regular aeration of its roots and periodic treatment with measured doses of insecticide , the bush remained as scraggly and as blighted as any specimen watered with venom and fed pure sulfur in the satanic gardens of Hell . Face to the sun , eyes closed , striving to empty her mind of all thought , yet troubled by insistent memories , Micky had been cooking for half an hour when a small sweet voice asked , " Are you suicidal ? " She turned her head toward the speaker and saw a girl of nine or ten standing at the low , sagging picket fence that separated this trailer space from the one to the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer kills , " the girl explained . " So does vitamin D deficiency . " " Not likely . " " Your bones get soft . " " Rickets . I know . But you can get vitamin D in tuna , eggs , and dairy products . That 's better than too much sun . " Closing her eyes again , turning her face to the deadly blazing heavens , Micky said , " Well , I do n't intend to live forever . " " Why not ? " " Maybe you have n't noticed , but nobody does . " " I probably will , " the girl declared . " How 's that work ? " " A little extraterrestrial DNA . " " Yeah , right . You 're part alien . " " Not yet . I have to make contact first . " Micky opened her eyes again and squinted at the ET wannabe . " You 've been watching too many reruns of The X Files , kid . " " I 've only got until my next birthday , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swooning fence to a point where it had entirely collapsed . She clattered across the flattened section of pickets and approached Micky . " Do you believe in life after death ? " " I 'm not sure I believe in life before death , " Micky said . " I knew you were suicidal . " " I 'm not suicidal . I 'm just a wiseass . " Even after stepping off the splintered fence staves onto the grass , the girl moved awkwardly . " We 're renting next door . We just moved in . My name 's Leilani . " As Leilani drew closer , Micky saw that she wore a complicated steel brace on her left leg , from the ankle to above the knee . " Is n't that a Hawaiian name ? " Micky asked . " My mother 's a little nuts about all things Hawaiian . " Leilani wore khaki shorts . Her right leg was fine , but in the cradle of steel and padding , her left leg appeared to be malformed . " In fact , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little nuts , period . " " Sinsemilla ? That 's a . . . " " Type of marijuana . Maybe she was Cindy Sue or Barbara way back in the Jurassic period , but she 's called herself Sinsemilla as long as I 've known her . " Leilani settled into a hideous orange-and-blue chair as decrepit as Micky 's bile-green lounge . " This lawn furniture sucks . " " Someone gave it to Aunt Geneva for nothing . " " She ought to 've been paid to take it . Anyway , they put old Sinsemilla in an institution once and shot like fifty or a hundred thousand volts of electricity through her brain , but it did n't help . " " You should n't make up stuff like that about your own mother . " Leilani shrugged . " It 's the truth . I could n't make up anything as weird as what is . In fact , they blasted her brain several times . Probably , if they 'd done it just once more , old Sinsemilla would 've developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger in a socket about ten times a day . She 's an addictive personality , but she means well . " Although the sky was a furnace grate , although Micky was slick with coconut-scented lotion and sweat , she 'd grown all but oblivious of the sun . " How old are you , kid ? " " Nine . But I 'm precocious . What 's your name ? " " Micky . " " That 's a name for a boy or a mouse . So it 's probably Michelle . Most women your age are named Michelle or Heather or Courtney . " " My age ? " " No offense intended . " " It 's Michelina . " Leilani wrinkled her nose . " Too precious . " " Michelina Bellsong . " " No wonder you 're suicidal . " " Therefore Micky . " " I 'm Klonk . " " You 're what ? " " Leilani Klonk . " Micky cocked her head and frowned skeptically . " I 'm not sure I should believe anything you tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two pretty names , and you 're as gorgeous as a model except for all the sweat and your face puffy with a hangover . " " Thanks . I guess . " " Me , on the other hand I 've got one pretty name followed by a clinker like Klonk . Half of me is sort of pretty " " You 're very pretty , " Micky assured her . This was true . Golden hair . Eyes as blue as gentian petals . The clarity of Leilani 's features promised that hers was not the transient beauty of childhood , but an enduring quality . " Half of me , " Leilani conceded , " might turn heads one day , but that 's balanced by the fact that I 'm a mutant . " " You 're not a mutant . " The girl stamped her left foot on the ground , causing the leg brace to rattle softly . She raised her left hand , which proved to be deformed : The little finger and the ring finger were fused into a single misshapen digit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gnarled and stubby middle finger . Until now , Micky had n't noticed this deformity . " Everyone 's got imperfections , " she said . " This is n't like having a big schnoz . I 'm either a mutant or a cripple , and I refuse to be a cripple . People pity cripples , but they 're afraid of mutants . " " You want people to be afraid of you ? " " Fear implies respect , " Leilani said . " So far , you 're not registering high on my terror meter . " " Give me time . You 've got a great body . " Disconcerted to hear such a thing from a child , Micky covered her discomfort with self-deprecation : " Yeah , well , by nature I 'm a huge pudding . I 've got to work hard to stay like this . " " No you do n't . You were born perfect , and you 've got one of those metabolisms tuned like a space-shuttle gyroscope . You could eat half a cow and drink a keg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighten up a notch . " Micky could n't remember the last time that she 'd been rendered speechless by anyone , but with this girl , she was nearly befuddled into silence . " How would you know ? " " I can tell , " Leilani assured her . " You do n't run , you do n't power walk " " I work out . " " Oh ? When was your last workout ? " " Yesterday , " Micky lied . " Yeah , " said Leilani , " and I was out waltzing all night . " She stamped her left foot again , rattling her leg brace . " Having a great metabolism is nothing to be ashamed about . It 's not like laziness or anything . " " Thanks for your approval . " " Your boobs are real , are n't they ? " " Girl , you are an amazing piece of work . " " Thanks . They must be real . Even the best implants do n't look that natural . Unless there 's major improvement in implant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can be a mutant and still attract men if you 've got great boobs . That 's been my observation , anyway . Men can be lovely creatures , but in some ways , they 're pathetically predictable . " " You 're nine , huh ? " " My birthday was February twenty-eighth . That was Ash Wednesday this year . Do you believe in fasting and penitence ? " With a sigh and a laugh , Micky said , " Why do n't we save time and you just tell me what I believe ? " " Probably not much of anything , " Leilani said , without a pause . " Except in having fun and getting through the day . " Micky was left speechless not by the child 's acute perception but by hearing the truth put so bluntly , especially as this was a truth that she had long avoided contemplating . " Nothing wrong with having fun , " said Leilani . " One of the things I believe , if you want to know , is that we 're here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazing . Men must be all over you . " " Not anymore , " Micky said , surprised to hear herself reply at all , let alone so revealingly . A lopsided smile tugged at the right corner of the girl 's mouth , and unmistakable merriment enlivened her blue eyes . " Now do n't you wish you could see me as a mutant ? " " What ? " " As long as you think of me as a handicapped waif , your pity does n't allow you to be impolite . On the other hand , if you could see me as a weird and possibly dangerous mutant , you 'd tell me none of this is my business , and you 'd hustle me back to my own yard . " " You 're looking more like a mutant all the time . " Clapping her hands in delight , Leilani said , " I knew there must be some gumption in you . " She rose from her chair with a hitch and pointed across the backyard . " What 's that thing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Really . It 's a rosebush . " " No roses . " " The potential 's there . " " Hardly any leaves . " " Lots of thorns , though , " Micky noted . Squinching her face , Leilani said , " I bet it pulls up its roots late at night and creeps around the neighborhood , eating stray cats . " " Lock your doors . " " We do n't have cats . " Leilani blinked . " Oh . " She grinned . " Good one . " She hooked her right hand into an imitation of a claw , raked the air , and hissed . " What did you mean when you said all bets are off ' ? " " When did I say that ? " Leilani asked disingenuously . " You said you 've only got until your next birthday , and then all bets are off . " " Oh , the alien-contact thing . " Although that was n't an answer , she turned away from Micky and crossed the lawn in a steel-stiffened gait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge chair . " Leilani ? " " I say a lot of stuff . Not all of it means anything . " At the gap in the broken fence , the girl stopped and turned . " Say , Michelina Bellsong , did I ask whether you believe in life after death ? " " And I was a wise-ass . " " Yeah , I remember now . " " So . . . do you ? " Micky asked . " Do I what ? " " Believe in life after death ? " Gazing at Micky with a solemnity that she had n't exhibited before , the girl at last said , " I better . " As she negotiated the fallen pickets and crossed the neglected sun-browned lawn next door , the faint click-and-squeak of her leg brace faded until it could have been mistaken for the language of industrious insects hard at work in the hot , dry air . For a while after the girl had gone into the neighboring house trailer , Micky sat forward in the lounge chair , staring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty package of charm , intelligence , and cocky attitude that masked an aching vulnerability . But while remembered moments of their encounter now brought a smile to Micky , she was also left with a vague uneasiness . Like a quick dark fish , some disturbing half-glimpsed truth had seemed to dart beneath the surface of their conversation , though it eluded her net . The liquid-thick heat of the late-August sun pooled around Micky . She felt as though she were floating in a hot bath . The scent of recently mown grass saturated the still air : the intoxicating essence of summer . In the distance rose the lulling rumble-hum of freeway traffic , a not unpleasant drone that might be mistaken for the rhythmic susurration of the sea . She should have grown drowsy , at least lethargic , but her mind hummed more busily than the traffic , and her body grew stiff with a tension that the sun could n't cook from her . Although it seemed unrelated to Leilani Klonk , Micky recalled something that her aunt Geneva had said only the previous evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy , Micky . Changing the way you live means changing how you think . Changing how you think means changing what you believe about life . That 's hard , sweetie . When we make our own misery , we sometimes cling to it even when we want so bad to change , because the misery is something we know . The misery is comfortable . " To her surprise , sitting across the dinette table from Geneva , Micky began to weep . No racking sobs . Discreet , this weeping . The plate of homemade lasagna blurred in front of her , and hot tears slid down her cheeks . She kept her fork in motion throughout this silent salty storm , loath to acknowledge what was happening to her . She had n't cried since childhood . She 'd thought that she was beyond tears , too tough for self-pity and too hardened to be moved by the plight of anyone else . With grim determination , angry with herself for this weakness , she continued eating even though her throat grew so thick with emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her niece 's stoic nature , nevertheless did n't seem surprised by the tears . She did n't comment on them , because she surely knew that consolation would n't be welcome . By the time Micky 's vision cleared and her plate was clean , she was able to say , " I can do what I need to do . I can get where I want to go , no matter how hard it is . " Geneva added one thought before changing the subject : It 's also true that sometimes not often , but once in a great while your life can change for the better in one moment of grace , almost a sort of miracle . Something so powerful can happen , someone so special come along , some precious understanding descend on you so unexpectedly that it just pivots you in a new direction , changes you forever . Girl , I 'd give everything I have if that could happen for you . To stave off more tears , Micky said , " That 's sweet , Aunt Gen , but everything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached across the table , and gave Micky 's left hand an affectionate squeeze . " That 's true enough , honey . But I 've still got about half a squat more than you do . " Strangely , here in the sunshine , less than a day later , Micky could n't stop thinking about the transforming moment of grace that Geneva had wished for her . She did n't believe in miracles , neither the supernatural sort that involved guardian angels and the radiant hand of God revealed nor the merely statistical variety that might present her with a winning lottery ticket ....
