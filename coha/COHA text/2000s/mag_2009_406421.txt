It may be tiny and tucked out of sight , but this house has had an outsized effect on its new owners . STYLED BY HELEN CROWTHER PHOTOGRAPHS BY CHRISTOPHER BAKER " The irony is that neither one of us was even supposed to go to that party , " says Kim Heirston , international art adviser , explaining to me from a poolside phone at the Hotel Bel-Air how she met her husband . We 've been trying for some time now to have an extended conversation , but she 's hard to pin down and over the past few weeks has been in Paris , Moscow , New York and Miami , and today it 's Los Angeles , though only for a day before she and said husband , Richard Evans , continue on to Australia . Photograph : In Bridgehampton , the home of art adviser Kim Heirston and her husband , Richard Evans , is a cedar-lined box that glows with light reflected off Mecox Bay . A Charlotte Perriand daybed from dealer Cristina Grajales , in Manhattan , faces the view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any continent , whether she 's attending a museum opening , negotiating a sale in a gallery 's back room or bidding at auction on behalf of one of her clients . She speaks in rapid bursts of high-energy lingo , and her enthusiasm is infectious . " Richard was a breath of fresh air , " she continues long-distance . " He had this big smile . " They danced all night and lay in a hammock " canoodling , " according to Heirston , at the 2004 summertime party . When Evans asked her what her astrological sign was and she said Gemini , he said , " Oh , no ! " and confessed his was the same . " Two Geminis ! Twins ! " They laughed so much , they almost fell out of the hammock . A few months later , the two New Yorkers were walking in Central Park when Evans , an entertainment lawyer turned property investor , blurted out , " You want to get married in Italy next week ? " ( He confesses it was one of his cornier lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful , " she replied . Evans found a Web site called **25;2686;TOOLONG , and by the end of October they had done just that , in the Umbrian town of Citt della Pieve . The challenge for Heirston and Evans , both perpetual travelers , was how to be in the same place long enough to forge a lifelong relationship . They thought a new house might provide a promising start . Within a year they had found a modernist escape pod in Bridgehampton , New York , that would become the locus for their shared vision , a spot in which to slow down and grow together . The two-bedroom dwelling is perched , ever so lightly , on a one-acre site overlooking Mecox Bay . Nestled inconspicuously among the native growth of shadberry , beach plum and wild roses , it is hardly visible from the road or even from the water . " It had an incredible location and this island feel about it , " explains Evans . " I thought it was the coolest house I 'd ever seen , " says Heirston , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it was the middle of winter and the ground was covered in snow . " When I see artwork , something happens , and it 's almost physical . I tend to appreciate things in terms of aesthetics and not practicalities . " It was the same with their house . " This was a genius place , " she recalls . " It had a grandeur and theatricality that belied its size . " Photograph : The wood-and-glass pavilion is suspended between two concrete-block piers , which conceal bathrooms and a walk-in closet . They both fell in love with the property , and they bought it in early 2006 . " My immediate impression was that this was a real modernist gem , and I wanted to preserve it as it was , " says Evans , who started to research the house and found that its provenance was as interesting as that of any of his wife 's art acquisitions . Built in 1968 for a New York City scientist , the couple 's new home was designed by Horace Gifford , an architect whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty small and elegantly restrained beach houses throughout the Hamptons and on nearby Fire Island in the sixties and seventies . Gifford 's dwellings were all variations on the same geometric theme : basic glass boxes with roofs that were either flat or sloped , butterfly-style , and arranged in a staggered series , set back from a dune , or in a pinwheel configuration around a central sun court . While tiny by today 's standards  --  the average size of a Gifford beach pad was only 1,100 square feet  --  his houses always featured large windows and expansive decks that made them feel much bigger . " The site , " wrote Gifford of his process , " usually suggests what the house wants to be as a form in space . " Photograph : She 's carried the mood into the master bedroom with a fur throw from Adrienne Landau , a Tommi Parzinger mirror and an Arne Jacobsen Egg chair and stool . Heirston and Evans 's quintessential beach getaway keeps very good company on the East End . Within a stone 's throw are several other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Barbara Neski , Ulrich Franzen , Philip Johnson , Andrew Geller , Charles Gwathmey and Norman Jaffe , all proof that the area was a laboratory for architectural experimentation at the time . These modest houses shared a lyricism determined in large part by their carefree pre-McMansion agenda  --  think cookouts , bodysurfing and bunk beds , not the hypersocial networking that can make a modern-day Hamptons weekend as calming as a Manhattan traffic jam . ( Summer living in 1968 was much simpler than it is now . ) And while Heirston and Evans do not exactly don overalls or hand in their cell phones when they arrive for an extended summer weekend , they are able to relax and shed some of the angst that characterizes their hectic lives . The dwelling 's size and proximity to nature force the two , in a sense , to abandon the city and return to basic pleasures : reading , chatting , lying in the sun and swimming . ( They both grew up near the ocean  --  Heirston on Long Island ; Evans in Perth , Australia  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most subtle of ways : it 's a wood-framed box , stretched and cantilevered over its foundation at either end with glassed-in overhangs that rest on steel I beams . " When you jump at one end , the other end bounces , " says Evans . But this is also what gives the place its sense of untethered lightness , akin to a boat drifting on the bay . The entry , tucked inside a small courtyard , is shaded by a screen of vertical cedar slats that creates a dark teahouse effect . ( The courtyard , which has symmetrical concrete walls and Japanese pines , was designed by Ward Bennett and added in the early 1970s . ) But as soon as you walk into the main living space , the view opens up and " you feel as though you 've gone from outside to outside , " Evans says . Photograph : " For someone like me , always going to sexy places  --  Paris , Dubai , Moscow , Miami  --  our little house seems like the sexiest place of all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece by Gary Webb . Between the living area , with its cedar-clad walls , and the water is an expanse of floor-to-ceiling glass . The view spills out beyond a sundeck to Mecox Bay . Clerestory windows span the perimeter of the room and fill the space with sea-flecked light . On one side is an open kitchen with a concrete-slab counter and a passage to a study-guest room ; on the other is a dining area and , beyond it , the master bedroom and bath . Heirston and Evans chose furniture and art carefully to complement the clean lines and breezy optimism of the house . They started off in a 1950s Scandinavian direction but then consulted with designer Joe D'Urso , who advised them to consider not just wood but also stone and other materials that would create more of a contrast with the cedar-lined interior . A low-lying Charlotte Perriand daybed from 1950 , purchased from Cristina Grajales , a Manhattan dealer who specializes in 20th-century furniture , looks as if it had been designed specifically for its sunset position in front of the big window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug and two Mies van der Rohe chairs , a stone coffee table and two custom-made chaises flanking a fireplace , above which hangs a large-scale photograph by Louise Lawler . The dining table , a 1960s Karl Springer design made from a hefty slab of off-white marble , sits beneath Gary Webb 's New York Split ( 2006 ) , a mirrored wall piece that bounces fractured reflections around the room . For the bedroom , the couple chose an Arne Jacobsen Egg chair and stool , a Tommi Parzinger sunburst mirror that hangs over the bed , and a seductively comfortable chaise longue ( called Listen to Me ) by Edward Wormley . This is where Heirston likes to sit on quiet weekends and read her art books . Photograph : Ant chairs by Arne Jacobsen and Steuben crystal candlesticks lighten the look . " My idea of kicking back is plowing through an artist 's monograph , " Heirston says . " I get such a high when I take in knowledge because so much of the time I 'm holding forth . " But sometimes it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the water . Nothing else . There are fewer expectations here , fewer nagging doubts . " We get up in the morning and watch the swans glide up to our deck . It 's the ultimate chill pad . We go to detox . It 's my dose of sunshine : happy , open and nature driven . " While Manhattan continues to be their year-round base , the house has become soul renewing during the months of July and August , as well as weekends in the fall . For the immediate future , the couple plans to make only basic improvements : replace some windows , repair cedar paneling and decking . Meanwhile , their friend the landscape designer Edwina von Gal has begun to clear the property and restore the natural vegetation around it . Photograph : The couple often have guests for cocktails on the deck before moving indoors for dinner around a commanding Karl Springer dining table .

" It 's this sexy little Miesian pavilion right on the water . The proportions are perfect .
