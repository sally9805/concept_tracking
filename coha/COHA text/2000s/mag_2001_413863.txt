YOU CAN TEACH OLD DOGS NEW TRICKS THEY 'RE EXPERIENCED BACKPACKERS with a grim secret : Their friends wo n't hike with them anymore . It 's not because Jamie and Joe snore or stink or stick grubby fingers in the communal peanut butter jar . Our couple is guilty of a far greater sin , and that 's poor planning . Jamie and Joe choke down bad meals by the dim light of a fading headlamp miles from campsites they never had a chance of reaching . They spend hours looking for lost gear and trying to get their bearings . They run out of fuel . They 've even been known to forget the group TP . But before you write off Jamie and Joe as backcountry boneheads , consider how many late nights you 've spent pulling together a last-minute trip , then gotten to camp the next day and realized you 'd forgotten something . Between work , family obligations , and other responsibilities , it 's easy to do . Just as easy is abandoning a trip altogether because " it 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , and here 's where Jamie and Joe can help you . With expert assistance from packing and planning professionals , we identified four key areas of improvement for our befuddled pair , then devised strategies to correct their bad habits . Jamie and Joe ( they willingly volunteered , by the way ) took the advice to heart , made simple changes , and turned themselves into backpacking dynamos . The moral is simple : If these guys can improve , you can , too . EXPERT ADVICE Julie Morgenstern , author of Organizing from the Inside Out : The Foolproof System for Organizing Your Home , Your Office , and Your Life " If you can organize one thing , you can organize anything , " Morgenstern says of the couple 's proven ability to juggle multiple job demands . " Rather than thinking of your scattered possessions as an endless maze of boxes and bins , think in terms of ' closets ' that happen to be sprawled across Jackson , Wyoming . " The key " is to take as much thinking and remembering out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think " storage , " think " retrieval " The goal is to create easy , quick , hassle-free access to everything you need . Think carefully about each piece of gear 's function and how often you 'll need it , then store it accordingly , putting the oft-needed items readily at hand . For example , do n't pack your only tent beneath the telemark boots you use twice a year . Keep the tent at hand and those ski boots packed away . * Store all your backpacking gear in one place . Do n't bury long underwear in a box with your winter sweaters ; keep it with your pack and stove so it 'll be handy for midsummer trips to the mountains . Morgenstern recommends using clearly labeled , seethrough plastic bins that keep items clean , dry , and accessible . * Inventory your backpacking gear and post a master list on the door of your gear closet ( see Options A and B ) . " When you do n't see your stuff all the time , " cautions Morgenstern , " you tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That wastes time and money when it comes to packing . " Option A : Closet * Hook to hang backpack * Bin labeled " clothing " * Bin labeled " miscellaneous " for the little things you take on every trip , like a flashlight , toilet paper , toiletries , and a knife * Bin containing only winter gear : wool mittens , balaclava , etc. * Bin containing cookware , stove , and fuel * Unrolled self-inflating sleeping pad , with valve open , across the side or top of the closet * Sleeping bag hanging from ceiling in a big , breathable sack * Air-tight tin containing nonperishable food * Laminated gear list and erasable marker on the door Option B : Bins Do n't have a spare closet ? Buy three large plastic bins and label them " cooking/food/toiletries , " " sleeping , " and " clothing . " Store them somewhere that 's dry and safe from mice . Then , you 're three steps ahead when it 's time to pack . Mark the calendar , then divide and conquer * Pick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it just like you would a wedding . No matter how spontaneous you are , spur-of-the  --  moment trips rarely come together . * Divvy up tasks among hiking partners . One can collect travel facts and maps , another the gear . * Avoid the " last minute " trap . Create a false deadline a week or two in advance of the trip and take it seriously . Sticking to this due date will prompt the adrenaline rush of last-minute pressure , but then actually allow you a cushion of time in case you run into glitches. * Do n't reinvent the wheel for every trip . Keep maps and other trail information in a file . To make the job even simpler , use the meal planner on page 49 and the gear lists at www.backpacker.com/ gearlists ( or see " The Ultimate Gear List , " March 2000 , or call 610-967-8296 to purchase a copy for $3.50 ) . End Result " We took Morgenstern 's advice to heart and it worked wonders , " raves Joe , who inventoried and numbered all their boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the computer . Now they do n't waste time and money searching for " lost " gear and buying replacements . " Setting a false deadline 1 week in advance of our trips has also been great for us , " Joe adds , " because now we see holes sooner and are n't running around like a chicken with its head cut off . " Money-saving tip : Make a storage sack by folding a bedsheet in half and sewing two sides closed . Store your sleeping bag , unstuffed and unrolled , in this sack between trips to keep the insulation from compressing . Time-saving tip : Use the template below to create a trip planning/packing checklist . Fill out one for each trip , customizing it to your own needs . Save the checklists for future reference . Time-saving tip : There 's nothing like opening your food container to find wellfed moths . Put bay leaves , found in the spice aisle at grocery stores , in the food container to keep bugs away . EXPERT ADVICE Alan Marlatt , Ph.D. , professor of psychology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , Seattle " Jamie and Joe 's situation is n't unusual , " says Dr. Marlatt , equating it with research he 's done on New Year 's resolutions . " The people who fail to follow through are good at coming up with resolutions , but have n't figured out how they 're going to carry them out . " Without a clear , step-by-step plan that considers potential snags , an ambitious goal will never become a reality . Every successful backpacking trip has three steps : pretrip planning , the trip itself , and a post-trip wrap up . Pretrip Planning * Do the research . Joe started well by reading up on the 100-Mile Wilderness and ordering maps , but he did n't go far enough and get up-todate trail information from rangers or recent hikers . Had he taken this step , he 'd have known about the blowdowns that obliterated much of the trail . After you call the land manager for information , log on to our message boards at www. backpacker.com/trailtalk to get the latest scoop from hikers recently in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you physically ready for the terrain and length of the trip ? Can the slowest person in your group maintain the pace ? Do you have the skills and gear to handle the worst weather you could encounter ? If you answer no to any question , modify your goals . * Think one day at a time . Instead of picking a site as a goal and then calculating the miles you 'll have to hike per day , turn the process around . Estimate what you can accomplish each day under given conditions . By breaking your trip into daily chunks , you wo n't be tempted to make sweeping generalizations that overlook important factors like elevation gain and trail conditions . Technique to try- Let 's say you want to determine how long it 'll take to hike from Klondike Notch to the top of Yard Mountain in New York 's Adirondack Park . Here 's how . Step 1 : Figure the trail distance by tracing it with a length of string ( shown in pink , at right ) , then lay the string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1.25 miles . The average hiker 's pace is 2 mph on rolling , groomed trail , which means it would take 30 to 40 minutes to hike this section . But since it 's not flat from Klondike Notch to Yard Mountain , you need to figure in elevation . Step 2 : Count the number of contour fines that send you uphill and downhill to determine elevation gain and loss . On the map there are 7 descending contour lines . Each contour interval is 10 meters , so the descent is 70 meters . Translated into feet , 70 meters equals about 230 feet ( I meter equals 3.281 feet , so 70 X 3.281 = 229.6 ) . Use the same calculations for the ascending contour lines ( 31 fines uphill = 1,017 feet ) . Step 3 : Calculate your hiking tine . Every 1,000 feet of vertical gain adds 1 hour to your hiking time , so trekking 1,017 feet up Yard Mountain means adding 1 hour . The hike will take at least 1 X hours . Do n't assume that descents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down . Step 4 : Allow extra time if you plan to take photos or like to stop to look at flowers , or if trail conditions are tough . The Trip * Be flexible . Surprises will happen , but if you 've done your homework , you can improvise the rest . And realizing you ca n't cover all the bases will keep you from getting frustrated when things do n't go as planned . * Keep a log to record weather and trail conditions , pace , time spent eating and setting up/breaking camp , enjoying the view , plus other information that 'll help you plan future trips . Post-trip Wrap-up Planning for your next trip always starts on the ride home . * Learn from your " accidents . " By keeping a record of your trip , advises Dr. Marlatt , you can pinpoint poor decisions and avoid them next time . * Assess as you unpack . Did you use each piece of gear ? Leave unnecessary items home next time . Repair broken gear and make a list of food , first-aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on your next shopping trip . End Result To test their new skills , Jamie and Joe started planning a trek along the Teton Crest Trail in Grand Teton National Park , but soon found that snow still blanketed the high-elevation ridge . So , they opted for a shorter , less snowy route up Cascade Canyon and over Paintbrush Divide . Thoughtful planning and excellent conditions made for a reasonable 2X-day , 20-mile trip , with hours to spare for lolling on sundrenched rocks and photographing the Grand Teton radiant with alpenglow . They even had time for after-dinner games , a luxury they 'd never enjoyed on previous trips . " We were always trying to go as far as we could and see everything in a short amount of time , " explains Joe . " This was so much more fun ! " adds Jamie . EXPERT ADVICE Kristin Hostetter , BACKPACKER Equipment Editor , outdoor-equipment columnist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , and former outdoors-store salesperson Many people buy gear based on what they might do , says Hostetter , not on what they actually do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration by thinking twice before every , purchase . They should also sell the gear they never use and buy well-made equipment that suits their current needs . " * Be realistic . Figure out what gear will work for 90 percent of your trips , regardless of what you might tackle in the future . Then wear it , crawl in it , set it up , or put it on , all while in the store , to ensure it 's right for you . Rent before you buy , if possible . * Shop creatively . If you decide you like winter camping , buy a fleece bag liner ( $90 ) to increase your bag 's temperature rating , rather than buying a new OF model ( $400 ) . In Joe and Jamie 's case , if they 'd tried zipping different sizes and brands of sleeping bags together , they 'd be snoozing soundly . Instead , they bought a matching set , which fits 6 ' Joe , but leaves tiny Jamie ( 5 ' 4 " ) freezing because of the extra room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesperson wo n't be using this gear , you will . If you do n't like something or do n't feel right about it , do n't buy it . Breakin time aside , a good rule of thumb is that if it hurts in the store , it is n't going to get any better after you walk out the door . * Never shop with a full wallet . You 're more likely to buy on impulse something you wo n't use . * Learn how to shop for bargains . Scan bargain Web sites ( www. rei-outlet.com ; www.altrec.com ; www.fogdog.com ) , catalogs ( Sierra Trading Post , 800-713-4534 ; Campmor , 888-226-7667 ) , and classifieds in hiking club newsletters . In mountain towns like Jackson , an outdoor adventurer can snag sweet deals on slightly used gear and apparel by stopping at yard sales and thrift shops and checking bulletin boards . * Know what you want before you step into the shop . Fill out the following gear needs lists at home . Take them to the store with you . They 'll help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best . Boots Needs * What 's your price range ? * What kind of terrain do you usually tackle ? ( e.g. , maintained trails , cross-country bushwhacking , scree scrambling , sharp rocks and roots ) * How big and heavy is your typical backpack load ? * In what type of climate do you most frequently hike ? * Do you have any preexisting injuries or conditions , like a weak ankle or Achilles tendon ? Tent Needs * What 's your price range ? * How many people will be using the tent , and how big ( tall and broad ) are they ? * What kind of weather do you typically encounter on your trips ? * Which is more important , plenty of living space or light weight ? Pack Needs * What 's your price range ? * Do you prefer an internal or external frame ? ( For more on the advantages of each , see the Gear Guide , March 2000 ; see page 11 for reprint information. ) * What 's your torso length ? ( See the Gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure the torso. ) * Do you need a specialty shoulder harness and hip belt ( such as one made specifically for women or a big or tiny waist ) ? * How many days is your typical trip ? * Do you frequently participate in overnight winter travel ? Bag Needs * What 's your price range ? * What 's the average temperature range during your typical trips ? * Do you most often camp in a wet climate or dry ? * How tall are you ? * What are your priorities in choosing a bag ( for example , light weight , freedom of movement ) ? * Are you a cold or a warm sleeper ? Stove Needs * What 's your price range ? * What 's the lowest temperature you 're likely to encounter when using this stove ? ( Multifuel stoves perform better than canister stoves lower temps. ) * Do you need a stove that can handle several types of fuel ? Will you be using it for international travel ? * Will you be using the stove with a backpacking oven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " piggyback " stoves that sit atop the canister . ) End Result Jamie and Joe solved most of their gear problems with some tweaking and trading for more appropriate models . For example , Jamie ditched her crampon-compatible heavy hikers and bought a pair of midweight boots that did n't chew up her feet . Now their packs are lighter , and their shoulders and feet more comfortable . Weight-saving tip : Pack everything you think you 'll need , then take out three nonessential items or substitute something simpler , smaller , or lighter . For instance , do you really need a pocket tool and a Swiss Army knife ? EXPERT ADVICE Dorcas S. Miller , frequent BACKPACKER contributor and author of Backcountry Cooking : From Pack To Plate In 10 Minutes " Jamie and Joe eat just to survive , " says Miller . " If they put in a little time before the trip , they can have at-home meals with little fuss in the backcountry . " While eating well requires more shopping , repackaging , and measuring at home , the rewards-stoking your engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food-more than pay off on the trail . * Spend a little extra time and money on food you really enjoy  --  spicy dinners , trail mix , roasted almonds , dried cherries , your favorite chocolate , whatever will boost your spirits . * Plan for variety . Raisins , nuts , and M &M's; might be a great snack for a weekend trip , but on longer outings , your taste buds need a break " Include variety in texture as well as taste , " advises Miller . Pack crunchy foods  --  nuts , pretzels , crackers , sesame sticks , corn nuts , malt balls-and chewy things  --  dried fruit , licorice , fruit bars , cheese . She recommends chocolate bars , hard candies , hearts at Valentine 's Day , and candy corn at Halloween for something different . * Think lightweight Jamie and Joe thought they were saving ounces and dollars by carrying MREs , but they were n't . Dehydrated or freeze-dried food is far more efficient . Some freeze-dried foods can be costly , so shop around for what fits your budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couscous , instant grits and rice , Chinese noodles , instant hash browns and refried beans , dehydrated chili , as well as good old noodles with sauce . * Dry your own . It 's easier than you think ( see upcoming Moveable Feast articles on food drying ) , and you 'll be able to reproduce mouthwatering home-cooked meals on the trail . End Result " This is so much better than what we ate before , " says Joe . At lunch and for snacks , they now linger over bags of dehydrated bananas , pears , and apples . At night , the couple marvels at their easy-to-prepare and flavorful Cashew-Ginger Chicken and Rice and chili dinners ( see page 97 for recipes ) .
