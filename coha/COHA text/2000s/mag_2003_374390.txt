To be conscious in these days of Paxil , Prozac and Dr. Phil is to question one 's own sanity on an almost weekly basis . Self-diagnosis is a tricky business , especially when it comes to the mind . Still , with all the memoirs of addiction and depression and the countless websites devoted to mental health , it 's more tempting than ever to lie down on the couch and ask , " Am I normal ? " <P> Clear answers are hard to find . For those of us who just do n't feel right sometimes ( and that means almost everyone ) , the list of possible disorders is endless , and their catchy , soundalike acronyms do n't help . Is your problem , perhaps , ADHD ( **31;16058;TOOLONG disorder ) , SAD ( seasonal affective disorder ) or GAD ( generalized anxiety disorder ) ? Or could it be all three ? <P> The correct answer , most often , is that it 's impossible to know  --  in large part because we 're precisely the wrong people to ask . Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia and author of Strangers to Ourselves : Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious , believes that there are fixed barriers to self-knowledge about what goes on deep inside our skulls . Says he : " I think that idle introspection in everyday life can be quite disruptive . " <P> But is n't the first commandment of modern life to keep tabs on the state of one 's own head , a running box score of syndromes and neuroses ? If so , then Wilson 's research says , Good luck ! For him , the unconscious mind is designed to be inaccessible so that its owners ca n't fiddle with it while it 's operating ( not unlike those computer chips in late-model cars whose secrets even Mr. Goodwrench ca n't crack ) . Consequently , our notions about what makes us tick are just that , notions , and very often wrong . We might as well be guessing the number of jelly beans in a bottomless jar . <P> Combined with the culture 's incessant encouragement to uncover , treat and neutralize whatever gremlins may lurk behind our brows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mental hypochondria . We give up on making fine distinctions and simply check ALL OF THE ABOVE . " It can be like medical student 's disease , " says Wilson , " where we think we have every new disorder . " Evidence for this , he says , can be found in the fact that disorders tend to vary over different cultures and over time . In Freud 's day , hysteria was all the rage  --  a problem experienced mostly by women , who formed the bulk of Freud 's clientele . Nowadays this diagnosis is rare . A doctor who ventures it risks getting slapped . <P> So where , one wonders , did hysteria go ? Perhaps to the same place ADHD will go someday  --  back into the minds of the doctors who discovered it and the patients who were convinced they had it . Maybe some disorders behave like epidemics : they spread by contact , there 's an immune response and they die out .                  @ @ @
