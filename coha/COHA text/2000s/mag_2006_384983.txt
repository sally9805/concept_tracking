// Mary Breckinridge was writing a letter near the fireplace in her big log home in Wendover when she heard a familiar call from outside her window . " Halloa , Aunt Matron ! Sally needs ya ! " Mary threw on her coat , grabbed her saddlebags full of medical supplies , and ran out into the windy , wintry Kentucky night . An hour later , her horse was picking its way along a frozen trail near the Middle Fork River . Soon they would have to cross the river to reach the " holler " where Sally waited in her cabin ready to give birth . Mary imagined how the cold , dark water would feel as it swirled about her legs , and an icy shiver danced down her spine . She tried to concentrate on the flickering lantern on the mule in front of her . Then she turned her thoughts to the new life that she would assist in making its way into the world that night . As she pictured the baby asleep in her arms , she forgot the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood and the reason she was in Appalachia . Born in 1881 in Tennessee , the daughter of an ambassador to Russia and the granddaughter of a United States vice-president , Mary had been used to an aristocratic life filled with summers at her family 's Kentucky estate , private boarding schools , and two years in Russia , where she watched the coronation of Czar Nicholas II . // Mary once told her mother that the two things she wanted most in life were adventure and a large family . When she fell in love , she happily gave up any ideas of adventure and settled for marriage . Then , when she was just twenty-five , her husband died . Heartbroken , Mary entered nursing school . She graduated in 1910 and remarried . But her dreams of a big family ended when first her daughter and then her son died , and she divorced her husband . Mary was sad and lonely , but she did n't feel sorry for herself . The thought of her children made her determined to help other children lead healthy , happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following World War I , she went to France with the American Committee for Devastated France as the director of a visiting nurse service . While there , she noticed that there were many fine midwives ( people trained to deliver babies ) , but few skilled nurses . In 1921 , she returned to America with an idea for an " experiment in nursing . " Two years later , she left behind the modern world and entered Eastern Kentucky , where there were no cars or trains , no telephones or mail service , no doctors or hospitals , no plumbing or running water or electricity , and few roads . That summer , Mary traveled 653 miles by horse and mule and interviewed 53 " granny women " ( country midwives ) . Some were very good ; some were very dirty . They lived like the mountain people did-in one- or two-room cabins with yellowing newspaper covering the walls to keep out the dampness and chill . Big iron beds took up most of the living space . Curtains , if there was a window , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their dresses . But despite these people 's poverty , Mary discovered that they were gracious and proud . // As she talked with the " baby cotchers , " Mary decided that Eastern Kentucky would be the perfect place to try her experiment-a nursing service that would employ not just midwives or nurses but women trained as both . After completing a midwifery course in England , Mary opened a clinic in the only empty house in the small community of Hyden . Soon afterward , she built Wendover , her home for the next forty years . The first nurse-midwives in the " Frontier Nursing Service " were British because there were no midwifery schools in America . But soon , American nurses were being sent to England for training so that they , too , could take part in Mary 's program . Because the nurses made their rounds on horseback , Mary insisted that they take at least five riding lessons before starting work . The nurses themselves cared for the horses and never took any risks that might endanger them . At first some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread a rumor that the nurse-midwives turned babies into bears . But people soon realized that not only did the nurses not turn babies into bears , but they also actually saved the lives of many mothers and newborns . The people showed their gratitude with gifts of food , crafts , livestock , and hard work . // In 1928 , Mary opened the Hyden Hospital and Health Center , and by 1930 clinics in four other communities were under way . Then World War II broke out , and it looked as though her experiment was over . The British nurses went home to England , leaving only a few Americans to carry on . But Mary saw it as an opportunity rather than a setback . She had been planning to start a midwifery school , anyway . The school opened in 1939 with two students . Mary died in 1965 , but the work she began more than eighty years ago continues . Today , the FNS still serves southeastern Kentucky , with a hospital in Hyden , four rural health clinics , a home health agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nurses have traded in their horses for jeeps ; the school now trains nurse practitioners as well as midwives ; and patients enjoy the luxuries of modern hospitals . Students have come from around the world to study this model of rural health and social service delivery . The American College of Nurse Midwives recognizes Breckinridge as " the first to bring nurse-midwifery to the United States " and the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing as " a leader in nurse-midwifery in the United States and a tribute to the accomplishments of Mary Breckinridge and her contemporaries . " In 1982 , the American Nurses Association inducted Breckinridge into its Hall of Fame for her contributions to the nursing profession in women 's health , community and family nursing , and rural healthcare delivery .
