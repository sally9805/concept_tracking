TORRINGTON , CONNECTICUT RUSH TO JUDGMENT There may be more- and less-behind the high-profile news account of a boy 's setting himself on fire // When I first heard the story , it went like this : One winter night a thirteen-year-old boy was watching TV with his friends . No adults were in the house . On came a show in which a handsome hipster doused himself with gasoline , set himself afire , and danced around . The hipster was dressed in a protective fireproof suit , but the innocent boy did n't know that . To him it looked as though soaking oneself in gasoline and setting oneself afire were safe and fun . The boy took some gasoline and a lighter into his snowy back yard and tried the stunt himself . He was gruesomely burned from head to toe-a victim of parental neglect , or irresponsible media manipulation , or maybe both . This was the story of Jason Lind , a teenager in Torrington , Connecticut , who suffered terrible burns on a Friday night in January . The story was misleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all the ingredients of a flashy news item : the image of a burned child , a popular television show , and political and moral controversy . Now let me tell you a nonstory . These are the facts in the Lind case , as far as I have been able to ascertain them . At 10:08 P.M. on Friday , January 26 , fire fighters were called to a house in Torrington . There they found a small group of teenagers wandering around , some in shock some giddy , some concerned . In the kitchen they found members of the household tending Jason Lind , whose legs and hands bore second- and third-degree burns . Jason , an award-winning Little Leaguer partial to skateboards and BMX bikes , had tried a daredevil stunt with fire . When one of the fire fighters asked what had happened , a kid on the scene replied , " They were playing Jackass . " When asked what that meant , the kid explained , " MTV , man . The local police gathered that Jason had begun playing with fire several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jackass . One sergeant told The Hartford Courant that Jason had held his boot over gasoline burning in the snow ; he had also put gasoline on his boot , ignited it , and then plunged his boot into the snow . Not everyone agreed with these reports . The Lind family 's lawyer said that Jason had been involved in only one previous episode with fire . On that January night Jason and several other kids visited his friends the Fords . Around eight-thirty Mrs. Ford , seeing the youngsters cozily curled in front of the TV with their shoes off , and knowing that there were two eighteen-year-olds among the group , felt comfortable leaving them to go to a friend 's house for a cup of coffee . By ten o'clock Jason had changed into some old pants and a couple of shirts and a sweater . He had put on a motorcycle helmet and an old pair of boots and had gone into the back yard with two friends and a plastic cup of gasoline . Minutes later Jason was on fire . His pants had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends extinguished the fire and took Jason inside , where they put wet towels on his wounds . Emergency personnel arrived and rushed Jason to a hospital , where , according to The Hartford Courant he apologized from the emergency-room table . Sometimes if you know more , things get less clear . Jackass is MTV 's second highest rated show , boasting a cumulative viewership of 39 million . Its host , Johnny Knoxville , is a charmingly dissolute thirty-year-old who leads a pack of skateboarding goofball dudes on expeditions of tasteless pranking and inept stunting . A diver plunges proudly from a ladder into a kiddie pool full of elephant poop . Johnny earns an ovation from his buddies by letting himself be sprayed by a scared skunk . The lads applaud and guffaw over the ankles they sprain and the noses they smash by slamming into immovable objects . Shot in a clunky home-video style and featuring plentiful digitally masked nudity , the show revels in all the naughty and risky things your parents warned you against ( but that you knew perfectly well you would survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnny Knoxville decides he wants to be set on fire . We see a stuntman , Kevin McCarthy ( identified as a " pyrotechnics professional " ) , put Johnny into a multi-layer " burn suit , " the kind used in movies . Kevin explains various safety precautions and shows Johnny how to signal for help if he should feel at all uncomfortable . When Johnny jokes about the situation , Kevin counters by telling him about the horrible burns that stuntpersons have suffered after making even slight mistakes . He then covers Johnny 's face with a fireproof mask , applies fuel with a paintbrush , and ignites Johnny with a flamethrower . Johnny dances around for about ten seconds and then gives the discomfort signal . Two assistants standing by with fire extinguishers instantly step in and put out the fire . Kevin pulls the mask off Johnny 's sweaty face . Relieved , Johnny explains that he gave the signal because he could n't breathe anymore-the fire was taking all his oxygen . Every Jackass episode begins with  --  and every commercial break is followed by-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be tried at home . The stunts , according to the disclaimer used at the time , are performed by " professionals and/or total idiots " Within four days of Jason Lind 's burning Senator Joseph Lieberman , of Connecticut , had talked with Jason 's father and had accused MTV of broadcasting Jackass irresponsibly . On February 7 Lieberman wrote a letter to MTV 's parent company , Viacom , reprimanding the network for presenting its material " without informing viewers that the performer of the stunt was wearing protective clothing " and asking MTV to change , reschedule , or " cancel this exploitative and degrading show . " Two things undermine Senator Lieberman 's statement . First , the factual error : more than half of the three-minute Jackass segment-about a minute and forty-five seconds-is devoted to showing Knoxville being suited in protective gear and to explaining the safety procedures in detail . Second , two days after Lieberman sent his letter , the Lind family 's attorney announced that Jason 's parents were busy caring for their child and felt that it was inappropriate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sorted from hearsay . " At this time , " the attorney said , " I do n't think anyone has a clear picture of what happened two weeks ago . Neither I nor the police have been able to ask Jason what happened " The doctors had recommended letting Jason recover before raising stressful questions . // Nevertheless , in the wake of the widely publicized story the notion of blaming TV for the misadventures of youth seemed to be in vogue . On February 3 a twelve-year-old in Florida doused his hand in bug spray , lit it on fire , and ended up with burns . " I do n't blame myself , " he said . " I kind of blame the show " - by which he meant Jackass . Then , on February 15 , Senator Fritz Hollings , of South Carolina , cited Jason Lind 's story when he proposed a bill ( S. 341 ) that would limit children 's exposure to " violent " television . His law would restrict children 's access to shows with " violent " special effects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , where the bloodshed is real . I 'm mystified . How can a senator use Jason Lind 's suffering to validate such a sweeping , inconsistent law when so many fundamental questions remain unanswered-and are possibly unanswerable ? By the beginning of April , MTV had moved Jackass to a later time slot and had removed every trace of wit from its disclaimer . Jason Lind had returned to school . He wore baggy cargo jeans over his bandaged legs . His attorney said he was embarrassed about the incident and did n't want anybody to notice him . According to the attorney , Jason was still " not able to shed clear light on the different stories , because he has no clear recollection of everything that happened . " As of this writing , Jason 's parents have announced no plans to pursue legal or political action . They are helping Jason to catch up on his schoolwork and get back to normal . A tutor works with him three nights a week . His mother , Kathy Lind , told a reporter , " He seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is focused . He is glad he is able to walk " When I have questions about childrearing , I turn to an authority I trust : my parents . On a recent visit home I sat at the kitchen table with my mother , who is ninety-two , and put before her all the clippings I had collected about Jason Lind . She read them and then looked up at me through her large , rectangular bifocals and said , " Strange . That boy , all burned up , apologizes in the emergency room . He knew what he had done was noodleheaded . I wonder if they 'd discussed it-if his parents had told him not to play with fire and then he went to somebody else 's house and did it anyway . Of course , Fm just guessing . Nobody knows , and it 's none of our business . " I asked my father , who is eightyseven , what he would do if Jason were his son . He rubbed the top of his bald head thoughtfully . " I 'd just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's learned the hard way . He 's not going to do it again . Get burned for a while , you know all about it . " When I consider the 4.9 million people who , according to MTV , viewed Episode 103 of Jackass without harm , and when I see how lovingly Jason Lind 's parents are nursing their son , I think my parents have the right idea . Blaming parents and attacking the media will not stop children from making mistakes . As the psychologist groping to understand a troubled youngster in Peter Shaffer 's play Equus says , A child is born into a world of phenomena , all equal in their power to enslave . It sniffs-it sucks-it strokes its eyes over the whole uncomfortable range . Suddenly one strikes . Why ? Moments snap together like magnets , forging a chain of shackles . Why ? I can trace them . I can even , with time , pull them apart again . But why at the start were they ever magnetized at all-just those particular moments of experience and no others-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - TELLER <p>
