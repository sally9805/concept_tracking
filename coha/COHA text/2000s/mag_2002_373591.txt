Americans are having a tougher time than ever making their mortgage payments , according to a survey just released by the Mortgage Bankers Association . Its data show that a record 1.23% of mortgages , or some 640,000 loans , are in foreclosure  --  with the lender moving to take the home from the borrower . That 's not only a significant jump over the 1% of loans in foreclosure last year at this time , but it 's the highest rate in 30 years of record keeping . <P> What 's behind the leap ? There 's the slumping economy , of course . When unemployment rises , late payments are n't far behind . But Mortgage Bankers Association economist Doug Duncan cites two other factors : the wider availability of credit to people who have in the past had trouble paying their bills , and a proliferation of such innovative mortgage products as interest-only loans , which  --  because they drive monthly payments artificially low  --  have encouraged people to buy bigger homes than they can afford . <P> The good news is that chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fannie Mae is now negotiating to let borrowers keep their homes in 53% of problem-loan cases , a sizable jump over the 35% it was " working out " five years ago . Other lenders are following suit for good reason : a foreclosure costs them $2,500 on average . Says Duncan : " Nobody wins in a foreclosure . " <P> What should you do if you 're feeling pressed ? <P> CALL YOUR LENDER IMMEDIATELY . Explain why you 're having difficulty making payments , how long that difficulty will last and what will have to be done to resolve it . Be prepared to provide financial details , including monthly income and expenses . The goal is to get the lender on your side , says mortgage lender James Nutter Jr . of Kansas City , Mo . " So do not wait for the lender to call you . If you call them , they will look upon that as you trying to not shirk your responsibility . " <P> REFINANCE . If you have yet to miss a payment , refinancing can ease your burden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your loan ( thereby stretching out your payments ) or convert some of the equity in your home to a cash cushion you could use to get by . <P> ASK FOR A PARTIAL PAYMENT . If you have an fha mortgage , your lender may be willing to let you make a partial payment  --  say , $700 instead of the full $1,000 you owe  --  without changing the terms of your mortgage . You typically ca n't do that with a conventional loan . But if you call and say you 've missed a payment , your lender may tell you that you can make that payment up by spreading it over the next few months . <P> LOOK AT A LOAN MODIFICATION . If you ca n't continue to pay at your current rate but you can pay something , your lender will generally try to work with you to come up with a payment that you can afford . This works a bit like a refi without going through that process . You 'll pay back what you owe , but you may do it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate .
