YUSUF CLIMBED THE TOWN 'S ramshackle bridge . There he joined an excited crowd : gypsies , unmarried apprentices , the village idiot , and three ne'er-do-wells with a big jug of plum brandy . The revelers had brought along a blind man with a fiddle . <p> The river was the soul of the town , but the heavy spring rains had been hard on her . She was rising from her bed in a rage . Tumbling branches clawed through her foam like the mutilated hands of thieves . <p> The crowd tore splinters from the bridge , tossed them in the roiling water , and made bets . The blind musician scraped his bow on his instrument 's single string . He wailed out a noble old lament about crops washed away , drowned herds , hunger , sickness , poverty , and grief . <p> Yusuf listened with pleasure and studied the rising water with care . Suddenly a half-submerged log struck a piling . The bridge quivered like a sobbing violin . All at once , without a word , the crowd took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer 's ragged shoulder . " You 'd better come with me . " <p> " I much prefer it here with my jolly audience , thank you , sir ! " <p> " They all ran off . The river 's turning ugly , this is dangerous . " <p> " No , no , such kind folk would not neglect me ! " <p> Yusuf pressed a coin into the fiddler 's palm . <p> The fiddler carefully rubbed the coin with his callused fingertips . " A copper penny ! What magnificence ! I kiss your hand ! " <p> Yusuf was the village cooper . When his barrel trade turned lean , he sometimes patched pots . " see here , fellow , I 'm no rich man to keep concubines and fiddlers ! " <p> The fiddler stiffened . " I sing the old songs of your heritage , as the living voice of the dead ! The devil 's crows will peck the eyeballs of the stingy ! " <p> " Stop trying to curse me and get off this stupid bridge ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddler spat . At last he tottered toward the far riverbank . <p> Yusuf abandoned the bridge for the solid cobbles of the marketplace . Here he found more reasonable men : the town 's kadi , the wealthy beys , and the seasoned hadjis . These local notables wore handsome woolen cloaks and embroidered jackets . The town 's Orthodox priest had somehow been allowed to join their circle . <p> Yusuf smoothed his vest and cummerbund . Public speech was not his place , but he was at least allowed to listen to his betters . He heard the patriarchs trade the old proverbs . Then they launched light-hearted quips at one another , as jolly as if their town had nothing to lose . They were terrified . <p> Yusuf hurried home to his wife . <p> " Wake and dress the boy and girl , " he commanded . " I 'm off to rouse my uncle . We 're leaving the house tonight . " <p> " Oh , no , we ca n't stay with your uncle , " his wife protested . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't this wait till morning ? You know how grumpy he gets ! " <p> " Yes , my Uncle Mehmet has a temper , " said Yusuf , rolling his eyes . " It 's also late , and it 's dark . It will rain on us . It 's hard work to move our possessions . This may all be for nothing . Then I 'll be a fool , and I 'm sure you 'll let me know that . " <p> Yusuf roused his apprentice from his sleeping nook in the workshop . He ordered the boy to assemble the tools and wrap them with care against damp . Yusuf gathered all the shop 's dinars and put them inside his wife 's jewelry box , which he wrapped in their best rug . He tucked that bundle into both his arms . <p> Yusuf carried his bundle uphill , pattered on by rain . He pounded the old man 's door , and , as usual , his uncle Mehmet made a loud fuss over nothing . This delayed Yusuf 's return . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked , muddy lanes , the night sky was split to pieces by lightning . The river was rioting out of her banks . <p> His wife was keening , wringing her hands , and cursing her unhappy fate . Nevertheless , she had briskly dressed the children and packed a stout cloth sack with the household 's precious things . The stupid apprentice had disobeyed Yusuf 's orders and run to the river to gawk ; naturally , there was no sign of him . <p> Yusuf could carry two burdens uphill to his uncle 's , but to carry his son , his daughter , and his cooper 's tools was beyond his strength . <p> He 'd inherited those precious tools from his late master . The means of his livelihood would be bitterly hard to replace . <p> He scooped the little girl into his arms . " Girl , be still ! My son , cling to my back for dear life ! Wife , bring your baggage ! " <p> Black water burst over their sill as he opened the door . Their alley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphill as best they could , squelching through dark , crooked streets . His wife bent almost double with the heavy sack on her shoulders . They sloshed their way to higher ground . She screeched at him as thunder split the air . <p> " What now ? " Yusuf shouted , unable to wipe his dripping eyes . <p> " My trousseau ! " she mourned . " My grandmother 's best things ! " <p> " Well , I left my precious tools there ! " he shouted . " So what ? We have to live ! " <p> She threw her heavy bag down . " I must go back or it will be too late ! " <p> Yusuf 's wife came from a good family . Her grandmother had been a landowner 's fine lady , with nothing more to do than knit and embroider all day . The grandam had left fancy garments that Yusuf 's wife never bothered to wear , but she dearly treasured them anyway . " All right , we 'll go back together ! " he lied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Yusuf led the way uphill . The skies and waters roared . The children wept and wriggled hard in their terror , making his burden much worse . Exhausted , he set them on their feet and dragged them by the hands to his uncle 's door . <p> Yusuf 's wife had vanished . When he hastened back downhill , he found her heavy bag around a streetcorner . She had disobeyed him , and run back downhill in the darkness . <p> The river had risen and swallowed the streets . Yusuf ventured two steps into the black , racing flood and was tumbled off his feet and smashed into the wall of a bakery . Stunned and drenched , he retreated , found his wife 's abandoned bag , and threw that over his aching shoulders . <p> At his uncle 's house , Mehmet was doubling the woes of his motherless children by giving them a good scolding . <p> AS SOON AS it grew light enough to see again , Yusuf returned to the wreck of his home . Half the straw roof was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black mud squished ankle-deep across his floor . All the seasoned wood for his barrels had floated away . By some minor quirk of the river 's fury , his precious tools were still there , in mud-stained wrappings . <p> Yusuf went downstream . The riverbanks were thick with driftwood and bits of smashed homes . Corpses floated , tangled in debris . Some were children . <p> He found his wife past the bridge , around the riverbend . She was lodged in a muddy sandbar , along with many drowned goats and many dead chickens . <p> Her skirt , her apron , her pretty belt and her needleworked vest had all been torn from her body by the raging waters . Only her headdress , her pride and joy , was still left to her . Her long hair was tangled in that sodden cloth like river weed . <p> He had never seen her body nude in daylight . He pried her from the defiling mud , as gently as if she were still living and in need of a husband 's help . Shivering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrapped her in it , then made her a makeshift skirt from his sash . He lifted her wet , sagging body in his arms . Grief and shame gave him strength . He staggered with her halfway to town . <p> Excited townsfolk were gathering the dead in carts . When they saw him , they ran to gawk . <p> Once this happened , his wife suddenly sneezed , lifted her head and , quick as a serpent , hopped down from his grip . <p> " Look , the cooper is alive ! " the neighbors exulted . " God is great ! " <p> " Stop staring like fools , " his wife told them . " My man lost his shirt in the flood . You there , lend him your cloak . " <p> They wrapped him up , chafed his cheeks , and embraced him . <p> The damage was grave in Yusuf 's neighborhood , and worse yet on the opposite bank of the river , where the Catholics lived . The stricken people searched the filthy streets for their lost possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and despair . The townsfolk caught two looters , pilfering in the wreckage . The kadi had them beheaded . Their severed heads were publicly exposed on the bridge . Yusuf knew the headless thieves by sight ; unlike the others , those rascals would n't be missed much . <p> It took two days for the suffering people to gather their wits about them , but common sense prevailed at last , and they pitched in to rebuild . Wounds were bound up and families reunited . Neighborhood women made soup for everyone in big cooking pots . Alms were gathered and distributed by the dignitaries . Shelter was found for the homeless in the mosques , the temple , and the churches . The dead were retrieved from the sullen river and buried properly by their respective faiths . <p> The Vizier sent troops from Travnik to keep order . The useless troopers thundered through town on horseback , fired their guns , stole and roasted sheep , and caroused all night with the gypsies . Moslems , Orthodox , and Catholics alike waited anxiously for the marauders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yusuf 's wife and the children stayed at his uncle 's while Yusuf put another roof on his house . The apprentice had stupidly broken his leg in the flood - so he had to stay snug with his own family , where he ate well and did no work , much as usual . <p> Once the damaged bridge was safe for carts again , fresh-cut lumber became available . In the gathering work of reconstruction , Yusuf found his own trade picking up . With a makeshift tent up in lieu of his straw roof , Yusuf had to meet frantic demands for new buckets , casks , and water-barrels . Price was no object , and no one was picky about quality . <p> Sensing opportunity , the Jews lent money to all the craftsmen of standing , whether their homes were damaged or not . Gold coins appeared in circulation , precious Ottoman sultani from the royal mint in distant Istanbul . Yusuf schemed hard to gain and keep a few . <p> When he went to fetch his family back home , Yusuf found his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's place fully into order : she 'd aired the old man 's stuffy cottage , beaten his moldy carpet , scrubbed his floors , banished the mice , and chased the spiders into hiding . His uncle 's dingy vest and sash were clean and darned . Old Mehmet had never looked so jolly . When Yusuf 's lively children left his home , Mehmet even wept a little . <p> His wife flung her arms around Yusuf 's neck . When the family returned to her wrecked , muddy home , she was as proud as a new bride . She made cleaning up the mud into an exciting game for the children . She cast the spoilt food from her drowned larder . She borrowed flour , bought eggs , conjured up salt , found milk from heaven , and made fresh bread . <p> Neighbors came to her door with soup and cabbage rolls . Enchanted by her charming gratitude , they helped her to clean . As she worked , his wife sang like a lark . Everyone 's spirits rose , despite all the trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave people so much to gripe about . Yusuf said little and watched his wife with raw disbelief . With all her cheerful talk and singing , she ate almost nothing . That which she chewed , she did not swallow . <p> When he climbed reluctantly into their narrow bed , she was bright-eyed and willing . He told her that he was tired . She obediently put her cool , damp head into the hollow of his shoulder and passed the night as quiet as carved ivory : never a twitch , kick , or snore . <p> Yusuf knew for a fact that his wife had been swept away and murderously tumbled down a stony riverbank for a distance of some twenty arshin . Yet her pale skin showed no bruising anywhere . He finally found hidden wounds on the soles of her feet . She had struggled hard for her footing as the angry waters dragged her to her death . <p> In the morning she spoke sweet words of encouragement to him . His hard work would bring them sure reward . Adversity was refining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His son was learning valuable lessons by his manly example . All this wifely praise seemed plausible enough to Yusuf , and no more than he deserved , but he knew with a black flood of occult certainty that this was not the woman given him in marriage . Where were her dry , acidic remarks ? Her balky backtalk ? Her black , sour jokes ? Her customary heartbreaking sighs , which mutely suggested that every chance of happiness was lost forever ? <p> Yusuf fled to the market , bought a flask of fiery rakija and sat down to drink hard in midday . <p> Somehow , in the cunning pretext of " repairing " their flood-damaged church , the Orthodox had installed a bronze bell in their church tower . Its clangor now brazenly competed with the muezzin 's holy cries . It was entirely indecent that this wicked contraption of the Serfish Slaves ( the Orthodox were also called " Slavish Serfs , " for dialects varied ) should be casting an ungodly racket over the stricken town . Yusuf felt as if that great bronze barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . <p> The infidels were ringing bells , but he was living with a corpse . <p> Yusuf drank , thought slowly and heavily , then drank some more . He might go to the kadi for help in his crisis , but the pious judge would recommend what he always suggested to any man troubled by scandal the long pilgrimage to Mecca . For a man of Yusuf 's slender means , a trip to Arabia was out of the question . Besides , word would likely spread that he had sought public counsel about his own wife . His own wife , and from such a good family , too . That was n't the sort of thing that a man of standing would do . <p> The Orthodox priest was an impressive figure , with a big carved staff and a great black towering hat . Yusuf had a grudging respect for the Orthodox . Look how they 'd gotten their way with that bell tower of theirs , against all sense and despite every obstacle . They were rebellious and sly , and they clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scourged , beheaded , and impaled . Their priest - he might well have some dark , occult knowledge that could help in Yusuf 's situation . <p> But what if , in their low cunning , the peasants laughed at him and took advantage somehow ? Unthinkable ! <p> The Catholics were fewer than the Orthodox , a simple people , somewhat more peaceable . But the Catholics had Franciscan monks . Franciscan monks were sorcerers who had come from Austria with picture books . The monks recited spells in Latin from their gold-crowned Pope in Rome . They boasted that their Austrian troops could beat the Sultan 's janissaries . Yusuf had seen a lot of Austrians . Austrians were rich , crafty , and insolent . They knew bizarre and incredible things . Bookkeeping , for instance . <p> Could he trust Franciscan monks to deal with a wife who refused to be dead ? Those celibate monks did n't even know what a woman was for ! The scheme was absurd . <p> Yusuf was not a drinking man , so the rakija lifted his imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , Yusuf found himself on his feet , stumbling after the Jew . The rabbi noticed this and confronted him . Yusuf , suddenly thick of tongue , blurted out something of his woes . <p> The rabbi wanted no part of Yusuf 's troubles . However , he was a courteous man , and he had a wise suggestion . <p> There were people of the Bogomil faith within two days ' journey . These Bogomils had once been the Christian masters of the land , generations ago , before the Ottoman Turks brought order to the valleys and mountains . Both Catholics and Orthodox considered the Bogomils to be sinister heretics . They thought this for good reason , for the Bogomils ( who were also known as " Cathars " and " Patarines " ) , were particularly skilled in the conjuration and banishment of spirits . <p> So said the rabbi . The local Christians believed that the last Bogomils had been killed or assimilated long ago , but a Jew , naturally , knew better than this . The rabbi alleged that a small clan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jewish peddlers sometimes met the Bogomils , to do a little business : the Bogomils were bewhiskered clansmen with goiters the size of fists , who ambushed the Sultan 's tax men , ripped up roads , ate meat raw on Fridays , and married their own nieces . <p> Next day , when Yusuf recovered from his hangover , he told his wife that he needed to go on pilgrimage into the hills for a few days . She should have pointed out that their house was still half-wrecked and his business was very pressing . Instead she smiled sweetly , packed him four days of home-cooked provisions , darned his leggings , and borrowed him a stout donkey . <p> No one could find the eerie Bogomil village without many anxious moments , but Yusuf did find it . This was a dour place where an ancient people of faith were finally perishing from the Earth . The meager village clustered in the battered ruin of a hillside fort . The poorly thatched hovels were patched up from tumbledown bits of rock . Thick nettles infested the rye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock-kneed . The plum orchard buzzed with swarms of vicious yellow wasps . There was not a child to be seen . <p> The locals spoke a Slavish dialect so thick and archaic that it sounded as if they were chewing stale bread . They did have a tiny church of sorts , and in there , slowly dipping holy candles in a stinking yellow mix of lard and beeswax , was their elderly , half-starved pastor , the man they called their " Djed . " <p> The Bogomil Djed wore the patched rags of black ecclesiastical robes . He had a walleye , and a river of beard tumbling past his waist . <p> With difficulty , Yusuf confessed . <p> " I like you , Moslem boy , " said the Bogomil priest , with a wink or a tic of his bloodshot walleye . " It takes an honest man to tell such a dark story . I can help you . " <p> " Thank you ! Thank you ! How ? " <p> " By baptizing you in the gnostic faith , as revealed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but I can clarify your suffering , so hearken to me . God , the Good God , did not create this wicked world . This evil place , this sinful world we must endure , was created by God 's elder archangel , Satanail the Demiurge . The Demiurge created all the Earth , and also some bits of the lower heavens . Then Satanail tried to create Man in the image of God , but he succeeded only in creating the flesh of Man . That is why it was easy for Satanail to confound and mislead Adam , and all of Adam 's heritage , through the fleshly weakness of our clay . " <p> " I never heard that word , ' Demiurge/ There 's only one God . " <p> " No , my boy , there are two Gods : the bad God , who is always with us , and the good God , who is unknowable . Now I will tell you all about the dual human and divine nature of Jesus Christ . This is the most wonderful of gnostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael , Satanail the Creator , and the clay Hierographon . " <p> " But my wife is not a Christian at all ! I told you , she comes from a nice family . " <p> " Your wife is dead . " <p> A chill gripped Yusuf . He struggled for something to say . <p> " My boy , is your woman nosferatu ? You can tell me . " <p> " I do n't know that word either . " <p> " Does she hate and fear the light of the sun ? " <p> " My wife loves sunlight ! She loves flowers , birds , pretty clothes , she likes everything nice . " <p> " Does she suck the blood of your children ? " <p> Yusuf shook his head and wiped at his tears . <p> The priest shrugged reluctantly . " Well , no matter - you can still behead her and impale her through the heart ! Those measures always settle things ! " <p> Yusuf was scandalized . " What would I tell the neighbors ? " <p> The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks the Earth , my boy . You do need to do something . " <p> " How could a woman be dead and not know she 's dead ? " <p> " In her woman 's heart she suspects it . But she 's too stubborn to admit it . She died rashly and foolishly , disobeying her lord and master , and she left her woman 's body lying naked in some mud . Imagine the shame to her spirit ! This young wife with a house and small children , she left her life 's duties undone ! Her failure was more than her spirit could admit . So , she does not live , but she stubbornly persists . " The priest slowly dipped a bare white string into his pot of wax . " &; man may work from sun to sun , but a woman 's work is never done . ' " <p> Yusuf put his head in his hands and wept . The Djed had convinced him . Yusuf was sure that he had found the best source of advice on his troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's to become of me now ? What 's to become of my poor children ? " <p> " Do you know what a succubus is ? " said the priest . <p> " No , I never heard that word . " <p> " If your dead wife had become a succubus , you would n't need any words . Never mind that . I will prophesy to you of what comes next . Her dead flesh and immortal spirit must part sometimes , for that is their dual nature . So sometimes you will find that her spirit is there , while her flesh is not there . You will hear her voice and turn to speak , - but there will be no one . The pillow will have the dent of her head , but no head lying there . The pot might move from the stove to the table , with no woman 's hands to move it . " <p> " Oh , " said Yusuf . There were no possible words for such calamities . <p> " There will also be moments when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rotten body of a woman who drowned in the mud . If you are lucky you might not see that rotten body . You will smell it . " <p> " I 'm accursed ! How long can such torments go on ? " <p> " Some exorcist must persuade her that she met with death and her time on Earth is over . She has to be confronted with the deceit that her spirit calls ' truth . ' She has to admit that her life is a lie . " <p> " Well , that will never happen , " said Yusuf . " I never knew her to admit to a mistake since the day her father gave her to me . " <p> " Impale her heart while she sleeps ! " demanded the Djed . " I can sell you the proper wood for the sharpened stake - it is the wood of life , lignum vitae , I found it growing in the dead shrine of the dead God Mithras , for that is the ruin of a failed resurrection .... The wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and flesh . " <p> Yusuf 's heart rebelled . " I ca n't stab the mother of my children between her breasts with a stick of wood ! " <p> " You are a cooper , " said the Djed , " so you do have a hammer . " <p> " I mean that I 'll cast myself into the river before I do any such thing ! " <p> The Djed hung his candle from a small iron rod . " To drown one 's self is a great calamity . " <p> " Is there nothing better to do ? " <p> " There is another way . The black way of sorcery . " The Djed picked at his long beard . " A magic talisman can trap her spirit inside her dead body . Then her spirit can not slip free from the flesh . She will be trapped in her transition from life to death , a dark and ghostly existence . " <p> " What kind of talisman does that ? " <p> " It 's a fetter . The handcuff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet , a woman 's bangle . Fix that fetter , carved from the wood of life , firmly around her dead wrist . Within that wooden bracelet , a great curse is written : the curse that bound the children of Adam to till the soil , as the serfs of Satanail , ruler and creator of the Earth . So her soul will not be able to escape her clay , any more than Adam , Cain , and Abel , with their bodies made of clay by Satanail , could escape the clay of the fields and pastures . She will have to abide by that untruth she tells herself , for as long as that cuff clings to her flesh . " <p> " Forever , then ? Forever and ever ? " <p> " No , boy , listen . I told you ' as long as that cuff clings to her flesh . ' You will have to see to it that she wears it always . This is necromancy . " <p> Yusuf pondered the matter , weeping . Peaceably , the Bogomil dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yusuf said at last . " I do n't have to stab her with a stick ? I do n't have to bury her , or behead her ? My wife just wears a bracelet on her arm , with some painted words ! Then I go home . " <p> " She 's dead , my boy . You are trapping a human soul within the outward show of rotten form . She will have no hope of salvation . She will be the hopeless slave of earthly clay and the chattel of her circumstances . For you to do that to another human soul is a mortal sin . You will have to answer for that on the Day of Judgment . " The Djed adjusted his sleeves . " But , you are Moslem , so you are damned already . All the more so for your woman , so .... " The Djed spread his waxy hands . <p> The rabbi had warned Yusuf about the need for ready cash . <p> WHEN YUSUF and his borrowed donkey returned home , footsore and hungry after five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the neighbors ' laundry . It was as festive as a set of flags . All the rugs and garments soiled by the flood needed boiling and bleaching . So his wife had made herself the bustling center of this lively activity . <p> Yusuf 's smashed straw roof was being replaced with sturdy tiles . The village tiler and his wife had both died in the flood . The tiler 's boy , a sullen , skinny teen , had lived , but his loss left him blank-eyed and silent . <p> Yusuf 's wife had found this boy , haunted , shivering , and starving . She had fed him , clothed him , and sent him to collect loose tiles . There were many tiles scattered in the wrecked streets , and the boy knew how to lay a roof , so , somehow , without anything being said , the boy had become Yusuf 's new apprentice . The new apprentice did n't eat much . He never said much . As an orphan , he was in no position to demand any wages or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making barrels , he was the ideal addition to the shop . <p> Yusuf 's home , once rather well known for ruckus , had become a model of sociable charm . Neighbors were in and out of the place all the time , bringing sweets , borrowing flour and salt , swapping recipes , leaving children to be baby-sat. seeing the empty barrels around , his wife had started brewing beer as a profitable sideline . She also stored red paprikas in wooden kegs of olive oil . People started leaving things at her house to sell . She was planning on building a shed to retail groceries . <p> There was never a private moment safe from friendly interruption , so Yusuf took his wife across the river , to the Turkish graveyard , for a talk . She was n't reluctant to go , since she was of good birth and her long-established family occupied a fine , exclusive quarter of the cemetery . <p> " We never come here enough , husband , " she chirped . " With all the rain , there 's so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch a big bucket and give him a good wash ! " <p> There were fresh graves , due to the flood , and one ugly wooden coffin , still abandoned above ground . Moslems did n't favor wooden boxes for their dead - this was a Christian fetish - but they 'd overlooked that minor matter when they 'd had to inter the swollen , oozing bodies of the flood victims . Luckily , rumor had outpaced the need for such boxes . So a spare coffin was still on the site , half full of rainwater and humming with spring mosquitoes . <p> Yusuf took his wife 's hand . Despite all her housework-she was busy as an ant - her damp hands were soft and smooth . <p> " I do n't know how to tell you this , " he said . <p> She blinked her limpid eyes and bit her lip . " What is it you have to complain about , husband ? Have I failed to please you in some way ?

" Well , yes , children ! Children , of course ! It 's God 's will that man and woman should bring children into the world ! And , well , that 's not something you and I can do anymore . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> Yusuf shuddered from head to foot . " Do I have to say that ? I do n't want to . " <p> " What is it you want from me , Yusuf ? Spit it out !

" <p> " You want me to shelter your stupid concubine inside my own house ? " <p> " Where else couldl put a milosnica ? I 'm a cooper , I 'm not a bey or an aga . " <p> Demonic light lit his wife 's eyes . " You think of nothing but money and your shop ! You never give me a second glance ! You work all day like a gelded ox ! Then you go on a pilgrimage in the middle of everything , and now you tell me you want a concubine ? Oh , you eunuch , you pig , you big talker !

Ca n't I have one live woman , just to warm my bones ? " <p> " I 'd warm your bones . Why ca n't I warm your bones ? " <p> " Because you drowned in the river , girl . Your flesh is cold . " <p> She said nothing . <p> " You do n't believe me ? Take off those shoes , " he said wearily . " Look at those wounds on the bottoms of your feet . Your wounds never heal . They ca n't heal .

" <p> Yusuf gazed at the splintery wooden hulk . That coffin was a sorry piece of woodworking ; he could have built a far better coffin himself . Out of nowhere , black disbelief washed over him . Could he possibly be in this much trouble ? Was this what his life had come to ? Him , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard worker , devoted to his children ? It simply could not be ! It was n't true ! It was impossible . <p> He should have been in an almighty rage at his wife 's stinging taunts , but somehow , his skin remained cool ; he could n't get a flush to his cheeks . He knew only troubled despair . " You really want to put me down in the earth , in such a cheap coffin , so badly built ? The way you carry on at me , I 'm tempted to lie down in there , I really am . " <p> " Admit it , you do n't need any concubine . You just want me out of your way . And after all I did for you , and gave to you ! How could you pretend to live without me at your side , you big fool ? I deserved much better than you , but I never left you , I was always there for you . " <p> Part of that lament at least was true . Even when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jam herself into their narrow bed . She might be angry , yes , sullen , yes , impossible , yes , but she remained with him . " This is a pretty good fight we 're having today , " he said , " this is kind of like our old times . " <p> " I always knew you 'd murder me and bury me someday . " <p> " Would you get over that , please ? It 's just vulgar . " Yusuf reached inside the wrappings of his cummerbund . " If I wanted to kill you , would I be putting this on your hand ? " <p> She brightened at once . " Oh ! What 's that you brought me ? Pretty ! " <p> " I got it on pilgrimage . It 's a magic charm . " <p> " Oh how sweet ! Do let me have it , you have n't bought me jewelry in ages . " <p> On a sudden impulse , Yusuf jammed his own hand through the wooden cuff . In an instant , memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rusty sword . He remembered losing his temper , cursing like a madman , rushing back to his collapsing shop , in his lust and pride for some meaningless clutter of tools .... He could taste that deadly rush of water , see a blackness befouling his eyes , the chill of death filling his lungs <p> He yanked his arm from the cuff , trembling from head to foot . " That never happened ! " he shouted . " I never did any such thing ! I wo n't stand for such insults ! If they tell me the truth , I 'll kill them . " <p> " What are you babbling on about ? Give me my pretty jewelry . " <p> He handed it over . <p> She slid her hand through with an eager smile , then pried the deadly thing off her wrist as if it were red-hot iron . " You made me do that ! " she screeched . " You made me run into the ugly flood ! I was your victim ! Nothing I did was ever my fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the dropped bangle between his thumb and forefinger . " Thank God this dreadful thing comes off our flesh so easily ! " <p> His wife rubbed the skin of her wrist . There was a new black bruise there . " Look , your gift hurt me . It 's terrible ! " <p> " Yes , it 's very magical . " <p> " Did you pay a lot of money for that ? " <p> " Oh yes . I paid a lot of money . To a wizard . " <p> " You 're hopeless . " <p> " Wife of mine , we 're both hopeless . Because the truth is , our lives are over . We 've failed . Why did we stumble off to our own destruction ? We completely lost our heads ! " <p> His wife squared her shoulders . " All right , fine ! So you make mistakes ! So you 're not perfect ! " <p> " Me ? Why is it me all the time ? What about you ? " <p> " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , I 'm stuck with you . That 's why I 'm no good . So , I do n't forgive you , and I never will ! But , anyway , I do n't think we ought to talk about this anymore . " <p> " Would you reel that snake 's tongue of yours back into your head ? Listen to me for once ! We 're all over , woman ! We drowned , we both died together in a big disaster ! " <p> " Yusuf , if we 're dead , how can you be scolding me ? see , you 're talking nonsense ! I want us to put this behind us once and for all . We just wo n't talk about this matter anymore . Not one more word . We have to protect the children . Children ca n't understand such grown-up things . So we 'll never breathe a word to anyone . All right ? " <p> Black temptation seized him . " Look , honey , let 's just get in that coffin together . We 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be done . That coffin 's not so bad . It 's got as much room as our bed does . " <p> " I wo n't go in there , " she said . " I wo n't vanish from the Earth . I just wo n't , because I ca n't believe what you believe , and you ca n't make me . " She suddenly snatched the bangle from his hand and threw it into the coffin . " There , get inside there with that nasty thing , if you 're so eager . " <p> " Now you 've gone and spoiled it , " he said sadly . " Why do you always have to do that , just to be spiteful ? One of these days I 'm really going to have to smack you around . " <p> " When our children are ready to bury us , then they will bury us . " <p> That was the wisest thing she had ever said . Yusuf rubbed the words over his dead tongue . It was almost a proverb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bliss to that , like a verse in a very old song . It meant that there were no decisions to be made . The time was still unripe . Nothing useful could be done . Justice , faith , hope and charity , life and death , they were all smashed and in a muddle , far beyond his repair and his retrieval . So just let it all be secret , let that go unspoken . Let the next generation look after all of that . Or the generation after that . Or after that . Or after that . <p> That was their heritage . <p> Author Affiliation
