In 1969 , when PBS aired the Forsyte Saga  --  a 26-part Victorian-Edwardian mini-series based on John Galsworthy 's novels  --  it was revolutionary . Years before The Sopranos , it showed Americans that TV could tell stories as novels do . Its success led PBS to create Masterpiece Theatre  --  it was the soap that launched a thousand bustles . To say that remaking the show now is not quite so daring is kind . To be unkind  --  and honest  --  it only bolsters the criticism that PBS these days is redundant and irrelevant . <P> PBS argues that its documentary and public-service work is very relevant . And it argues that its tame entertainment programming is valuable because it 's free and uncommercial . But tax money aside , nothing is free here  --  just look at the pledge drives , the corporate crypto ads , and the costume dramas aimed at aging , risk-averse members ' fat wallets . PBS has taken a few chances , like the fine edu-reality series Frontier House and the well-meaning if melodramatic Hispanic drama American Family . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty-three years later , is PBS still worth it ? <P> To be fair , this is not the same old Forsyte  --  not exactly . It 's been pared to eight episodes ( Sundays , check local listings ) , with a faster pace and a foreshortened story . Soames Forsyte ( Damian Lewis ) , the scion of a wealthy , stodgy London family , is ready to settle down . He meets the near penniless Irene ( Gina McKee ) , his temperamental opposite : she loves art , he 's a philistine ; she is drawn to ideas , he to money . Naturally , she marries him . Soon she 's making eyes at Philip Bosinney ( Ioan Gruffudd ) , the brilliant , artistic architect whom Soames hires to build a country house . Their affair sends Soames into an obsessive rage and precipitates family conflicts that span generations . Irene is more than a love object ; she is modernity . The Forsytes long for her to perk up their tired blood , but she proves to be too much , and too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not as a justification for public TV , the new Forsyte is a success . Lewis makes Soames understandable , even pitiable , resisting the urge to Snidely-Whiplash it up . And McKee is captivating as the story 's enigmatic touchstone , whom every Forsyte irrationally and immediately loves or despises ( or both ) . The production is lush , racy and frank : we do n't just hear that Irene " takes steps to prevent " having a child with Soames ; we see that  --  in the contraceptive manner of the time  --  she douches after sex . But the themes ( love vs. money , bohemians vs. the Man ) probably appeared more vital in 1969 ; Soames is no less a villain , but Bosinney now seems , unintentionally , a bit of a preening artiste . <P> Forsyte should delight the Masterpiece faithful , but that should n't be PBS 's only ambition . Ironically , PBS is hailing this as the production that brings it into the 21st century . More like the early 20th . As the Victorians taught us , daring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a little ankle . But the network can only blame itself if it is not around to remake Forsyte again in 2035.  --  By James Poniewozik
