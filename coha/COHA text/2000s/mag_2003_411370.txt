It 's probably not the first golf destination travelers think of in Florida . But stretch the city limits to include the greater Tampa Bay area and it 's not far off . Without a broad definition of Tampa Bay , the region 's best daily-fee might appear to be out of reach . World Woods Golf Club in Brooksville , 50 miles north of Tampa , has dazzled golfers and architecture critics since it opened 10 years ago in a 2,100-acre pine forest . Despite the club 's off-the-beaten-track location , World Woods 's Pine Barrens and Rolling Oaks courses attract golfers from far and wide . Pine Barrens , ranked 10th on GOLF MAGAZINE 's Top 100 You Can Play , is a testament to designer Tom Fazio 's reverence for Pine Valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is as close to the perennial world No. 1 as most traveling golfers will get . Yet Pine Barrens stands on its own as one of the most compelling designs in Florida . At first blush , Pine Barrens appears to be a haven for long hitters , but shot values are of the essence , with most par 4s and 5s offering a clear position " A " off the tee . Fazio also toys with the unconventional , using split fairways on the 494-yard 4th and 547-yard 14th to force a choice between routes . From the fairways in , Pine Barrens is target golf at its finest . Moving from Pine Barrens to Rolling Oaks ( 46th on GOLF MAGAZINE 's Top 100 You Can Play ) is a bit like switching from jazz to blues . What was angular and enigmatic becomes straightforward and simple . Not that Rolling Oaks , also deigned by Fazio , is a pushover  --  as one ranger confided , it is the preferred layout of most World Woods ' employees . Think gentle doglegs with stately live oaks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number on Rolling Oaks . It 's just as easy to not care . Back in Tampa , a revitalized down-town and waterfront area features a new multi-sport arena , aquarium , museums , hotels and eateries . The SoHo district  --  named for a now-fashionable stretch of South Howard Avenue and appropriately adorned with pubs , chic restaurants and coffee houses  --  is a haven for the young professional crowd . Your next stop , the Westin Innisbrook Golf Resort , is one of Florida 's venerable golf institutions . Its unassuming entrance off U.S. 19 is a poker-faced front for what lies within . This 1,100-acre property houses 72 holes , four restaurants , six pools , tennis and racquetball courts , cycling trails , and even a wildlife preserve . Innisbrook 's Copperhead Course , designed by Lawrence Packard , is home to the PGA Tour 's Chrysler Championship . With elevation changes and thick stands of pines , Copperhead calls to mind the Sandhills of North Carolina . The par-71 layout stretches to a meaty 7,295 yards , but most holes offer plenty of landing room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tumbles from an elevated tee . Seventeen strong holes later , Copperhead culminates with one of the area 's best finishers , the uphill , 445-yard , par-4 18th . Copperhead may be Innisbrook 's marquee course , but the 7,063-yard , par-72 Island Course more than holds its own . In fact , while Copperhead is expansive and ready-made for driver , the Island Course is sinewy and tight , a haven for precision . The first six holes play around a large lagoon that can keep the fear of gators in the back of your mind . The next six venture back to dry , hilly terra firma , while the final six holes offer a bit of both worlds . The resort 's two other tracks , Highlands North and South , are serviceable , affordable layouts that appeal to golfers on a budget . The 6,768-yard South holds a special place in Florida golf lore : It 's home to the longest hole in the state , the 650-yard 13th . Saddlebrook Resort in Wesley Chapel , 30 minutes north of down-town , is another must-play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort 's two courses  --  the 6,564-yard , par-70 namesake layout and the 6,469-yard , par-71 Palmer Course . The Saddlebrook Course emphasizes careful placement off the tee and represents everything most golfers have come to expect from Florida golf : pancake-flat fairways , doglegs framed by tropical trees , and plenty of water hazards . Across the way at the Palmer Course , approach shots are the name of the game . Ed Seay , Arnold Palmer 's design partner , built the putting surfaces with nary a flat spot , and hitting the correct portion of the green is the only way to get yourself a realistic birdie putt . There 's plenty of mounding , which gives the layout a decidedly modern feel . Two years ago , Sarasota-based architect Chip Powell and the Donald Ross Society restored the 6,614-yard , par-71 Belleview Biltmore Hotel , Golf and Spa Resort course to its former glory . Donald Ross designed the original course here , Pelican Golf Club , in 1925 . For good measure , Powell threw in a series of new fairway bunkers and lagoons that appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And true Ross aficionados will also need to check out nearby Dunedin Country Club , a 6,565-yard , semiprivate track that opened in 1927 and served as the headquarters of the PGA of America from 1945 to 1962 . The most popular course in town , according to readers of the Tampa Tribune , is the Tournament Players Club of Tampa Bay . This Bobby Weed-Chi Chi Rodriguez collaboration has hosted a Champions Tour event since 1992 . Not long at 6,898 yards , the layout is visually dramatic , with lots of mounding , and all the golf you could want . The design weaves through protected wetlands north of Tampa with a grace that earned it a citation as an Audubon-certified sanctuary . Good golf with a clean conscience is hard to beat . The Tampa Bay area also has a number of highly regarded daily-fee courses and affordable municipal venues . Fox Hollow in New Port Richey is a Robert Trent Jones design that most locals count among their favorites . Westchase Golf Club ( in Tampa ) , Heritage Harbor ( Lutz ) , Lake Jovita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooksville ) are worth exploring . The peak season runs from December through March . When in doubt , opt for March . Spring training is alive and well in the Bay area , which serves as preseason home to baseball 's New York Yankees ( in Tampa ) , Philadelphia Phillies ( Clearwater ) and Toronto Blue Jays ( Dunedin ) , as well as the hometown Devil Rays ( St. Petersburg ) . If you can handle the heat , the summer months are full of discounts , with the bargains often stretching all the way into November . Shane Sharp is based in Charlotte , North Carolina .
