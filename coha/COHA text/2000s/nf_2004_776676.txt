The Georgian and the Schoolgirl // Nadya and Stalin had been married for fourteen years but it extended deeper and longer than that , so steeped was their marriage in Bolshevism . They had shared the formative experiences of the underground life and intimacy with Lenin during the Revolution , then the Civil War . Stalin had known her family for nearly thirty years and he had first met her in 1904 when she was three . He was then twenty-five and he had been a Marxist for six years . // Joseph Vissarionovich Djugashvili was not born on 21 December 1879 , Stalin 's official birthday . " Soso " was actually born in a tiny shack ( that still exists ) to Vissarion , or " Beso , " and his wife Ekaterina , " Keke , " n ? e Geladze , over a year earlier on 6 December 1878 . They lived in Gori , a small town beside the Kura River in the romantic , mountainous and defiantly un-Russian province of Georgia , a small country thousands of miles from the Tsar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Westerners often do not realize how foreign Georgia was : an independent kingdom for millennia with its own ancient language , traditions , cuisine , literature , it was only consumed by Russia in gulps between 1801 and 1878 . With its sunny climate , clannish blood feuds , songs and vineyards , it resembles Sicily more than Siberia . // Soso 's father was a violent , drunken semi-itinerant cobbler who savagely beat both Soso and Keke . She in turn , as the child later recalled , " thrashed him mercilessly . " Soso once threw a dagger at his father . Stalin reminisced how Beso and Father Charkviani , the local priest , indulged in drinking bouts together to the fury of his mother : " Father , do n't make my husband a drunk , it 'll destroy my family . " Keke threw out Beso . Stalin was proud of her " strong willpower . " When Beso later forcibly took Soso to work as a cobbling apprentice in Tiflis , Keke 's priests helped get him back . // Stalin 's mother took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the priests who protected her . But she was also earthy and spicy : she may have made the sort of compromises that are tempting for a penniless single mother , becoming the mistress of her employers . This inspired the legends that often embroider the paternity of famous men . It is possible that Stalin was the child of his godfather , an affluent innkeeper , officer and amateur wrestler named Koba Egnatashvili . Afterwards , Stalin protected Egnatashvili 's two sons , who remained friends until his death and reminisced in old age about Egnatashvili 's wrestling prowess . Nonetheless , one sometimes has to admit that great men are the children of their own fathers . Stalin was said to resemble Beso uncannily . Yet he himself once asserted that his father was a priest . // Stalin was born with the second and third toes of his left foot joined . He suffered a pock-marked face from an attack of smallpox and later damaged his left arm , possibly in a carriage accident . He grew up into a sallow , stocky , surly youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgian street urchin . He was exceptionally intelligent with an ambitious mother who wanted him to be a priest , perhaps like his real father . Stalin later boasted that he learned to read at five by listening to Father Charkviani teaching the alphabet . The five-year-old then helped Charkviani 's thirteen-year-old daughter with her reading . // In 1888 , he entered the Gori Church School and then , triumphantly , in 1894 , won a " five rouble scholarship " to the Tiflis Seminary in the Georgian capital . As Stalin later told a confidant , " My father found out that along with the scholarship , I also earned money ( five roubles a month ) as a choirboy ... and once I went out and saw him standing there : " ' Young man , sir , ' said Beso , ' you 've forgotten your father ... Give me at least three roubles , do n't be as mean as your mother ! ' // " ' Do n't shout ! ' replied Soso . ' If you do n't leave immediately , I 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1909. // Stalin sometimes sent money to help his mother but henceforth kept his distance from Keke whose dry wit and rough discipline resembled his own . There has been too much cod-psychology about Stalin 's childhood but this much is certain : raised in a poor priest-ridden household , he was damaged by violence , insecurity and suspicion but inspired by the local traditions of religious dogmatism , blood-feuding and romantic brigandry . " Stalin did not like to speak about his parents and childhood " but it is meaningless to over-analyse his psychology . He was emotionally stunted and lacked empathy yet his antennae were supersensitive . He was abnormal but Stalin himself understood that politicians are rarely normal : History , he wrote later , is full of " abnormal people . " // The seminary provided his only formal education . This boarding school 's catechismic teaching and " Jesuitical methods " of " surveillance , spying , invasion of the inner life , the violation of people 's feelings " repelled , but impressed , Soso so acutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style and methods . It stimulated this autodidact 's passion for reading but he became an atheist in the first year . " I got some friends , " he said , " and a bitter debate started between the believers and us ! " He soon embraced Marxism . // In 1899 , he was expelled from the seminary , joined the Russian Social Democratic Workers ' Party and became a professional revolutionary , adopting the nom de revolution Koba , inspired by the hero of a novel , The Parricide , by Alexander Kazbegi , a dashing , vindictive Caucasian outlaw . He combined the " science " of Marxism with his soaring imagination : he wrote romantic poetry , published in Georgian , before working as a weatherman at the Tiflis Meteorological Institute , the only job he held before becoming one of the rulers of Russia in 1917. // " Koba " was convinced by the universal panacea of Marxism , " a philosophical system " that suited the obsessive totality of his character . The class struggle also matched his own melodramatic pugnacity . The paranoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koba 's own self-contained confidence and talent for intrigue . Koba plunged into the underworld of revolutionary politics that was a seething , stimulating mixture of conspiratorial intrigue , ideological nitpicking , scholarly education , factional games , love affairs with other revolutionaries , police infiltration and organizational chaos . These revolutionaries hailed from every background-Russians , Armenians , Georgians and Jews , workers , noblemen , intellectuals and daredevils-and organized strikes , printing presses , meetings and heists . United in the obsessional study of Marxist literature , there was always a division between the educated bourgeois ? migr ? s , like Lenin himself , and the rough men of action in Russia itself . The underground life , always itinerant and dangerous , was the formative experience not only of Stalin but of all his comrades . This explains much that happens later . // In 1902 , Koba won the spurs of his first arrest and Siberian exile , the first of seven such exiles from which he escaped six times . These exiles were far from Stalin 's brutal concentration camps : the Tsars were inept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages with one part-time gendarme on duty , during which revolutionaries got to know ( and hate ) each other , corresponded with their comrades in Petersburg or Vienna , discussed abstruse questions of dialectical materialism , and had affairs with local girls . When the call of freedom or revolution became urgent , they escaped , yomping across the taiga to the nearest train . In exile , Koba 's teeth , a lifelong source of pain , began to deteriorate . // Koba avidly supported Vladimir Lenin and his seminal work , What Is to Be Done ? This domineering political genius combined the Machiavellian practicality of seizing power with mastery of Marxist ideology . Exploiting the schism that would lead to the creation of his own Bolshevik Party , Lenin 's message was that a supreme Party of professional revolutionaries could seize power for the workers and then rule in their name in a " dictatorship of the proletariat " until this was no longer necessary because socialism had been achieved . Lenin 's vision of the Party as " the advance detachment " of the " army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the militarist tone of Bolshevism. // In 1904 , on Koba 's return to Tiflis , he met his future father-in-law Sergei Alliluyev , twelve years his senior , a skilled Russian electrical artisan married to Olga Fedorenko , a strong-willed Georgian-German-Gypsy beauty with a taste for love affairs with revolutionaries , Poles , Hungarians , even Turks . It was whispered that Olga had an affair with the young Stalin , who fathered his future wife , Nadya . This is false since Nadezhda was already three when her parents first met Koba , but his affair with Olga is entirely credible and he himself may have hinted at it . Olga , who , according to her granddaughter Svetlana , had a " weakness for southern men , " saying " Russian men are boors , " always had a " soft spot " for Stalin . Her marriage was difficult . Family legend has Nadya 's elder brother Pavel seeing his mother making up to Koba . Such short liaisons were everyday occurrences among revolutionaries . // Long before they fell in love , Stalin and Nadya were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household : Kalinin and Yenukidze among others at that dinner in 1932 . There was another special link : soon afterwards , Koba met the Alliluyevs in Baku , and saved Nadya from drowning in the Caspian Sea , a romantic bond if ever there was one . // Koba meanwhile married another sprig of a Bolshevik family . Ekaterina , " Kato , " a placid , darkly pretty Georgian daughter of a cultured family , was the sister of Alexander Svanidze , also a Bolshevik graduate of the Tiflis seminary who joined Stalin 's Kremlin entourage . Living in a hut near the Baku oilfields , Kato gave him a son , Yakov . But Koba 's appearances at home were sporadic and unpredictable . // During the 1905 Revolution , in which Leon Trotsky , a Jewish journalist , bestrode the Petersburg Soviet , Koba claimed he was organizing peasant revolts in the Kartli region of Georgia . After the Tsarist backlash , he travelled to a Bolshevik conference in Tammerfors , Finland-his first meeting with his hero , Lenin , " that mountain eagle . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his return , he lived the life of a Caucasian brigand , raising Party funds in bank robberies or " expropriations " : he boasted in old age of these " heists ... our friends grabbed 250,000 roubles in Yerevan Square ! " // After visiting London for a Congress , Koba 's beloved , half-ignored Kato died " in his arms " in Tiflis of tuberculosis on 25 November 1907 . Koba was heartbroken . When the little procession reached the cemetery , Koba pressed a friend 's hand and said , " This creature softened my heart of stone . She died and with her died my last warm feelings for people . " He pressed his heart : " It 's desolate here inside . " Yet he left their son Yakov to be brought up by Kato 's family . After hiding in the Alliluyevs ' Petersburg apartment , he was recaptured and returned to his place of banishment , Solvychegodsk . It was in this remote one-horse town in January 1910 that Koba moved into the house of a young widow named Maria Kuzakova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was involved in a love affair with a schoolgirl of seventeen named Pelageya Onufrieva . When she went back to school , he wrote : " Let me kiss you now . I am not simply sending a kiss but am KISSSSSING you passionately ( it 's not worth kissing otherwise ) . " The locals in the north Russified " Iosef " to " Osip " and his letters to Pelageya were often signed by her revealing nickname for him : " Oddball Osip. " // After yet another escape , Koba returned to Petersburg in 1912 , sharing digs with a ponderous Bolshevik who was to be the comrade most closely associated with him : Vyacheslav Scriabin , only twenty-two , had just followed the Bolshevik custom of assuming a macho nom de revolution and called himself that " industrial name " Molotov- " the hammer . " Koba had also assumed an " industrial " alias : he first signed an article " Stalin " in 1913 . It was no coincidence that " Stalin " sounds like " Lenin . " He may have been using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he borrowed the name from the " buxom pretty " Bolshevik named Ludmilla Stal with whom he had had an affair . // This " wonderful Georgian , " as Lenin called him , was co-opted by the Party 's Central Committee at the end of the Prague conference of 1912 . In November , Koba Stalin travelled from Vienna to Cracow to meet Lenin with whom he stayed : the leader supervised his keen disciple in the writing of an article expressing Bolshevik policy on the sensitive nationality question , henceforth Stalin 's expertise . " Marxism and the National Question , " arguing for holding together the Russian Empire , won him ideological kudos and Lenin 's trust . // " Did you write all of it ? " asked Lenin ( according to Stalin ) . // " Yes ... Did I make mistakes ? " // " No , on the contrary , splendid ! " This was his last trip abroad until the Teheran Conference in 1943. // In February 1913 , Stalin was rearrested and given a suspiciously light exile : was he an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The historical sensationalism of Stalin 's duplicity shows a na ? ve misunderstanding of underground life : the revolutionaries were riddled with Okhrana spies but many were double or triple agents . Koba was willing to betray colleagues who opposed him though , as the Okhrana admitted in their reports , he remained a fanatical Marxist-and that is what mattered . // Stalin 's final exile began in 1913 in the distant cold north-east of Siberia , where he was nicknamed " Pock-marked Joe " by the local peasants . Fearing more escapes , the exile was moved to Kureika , a desolate village in Turukhansk , north of the Arctic Circle where his fishing prowess convinced locals of magical powers and he took another mistress . Stalin wrote pitiful letters to Sergei and Olga Alliluyev : " Nature in this cursed region is shamefully poor " and he begged them to send him a postcard : " I 'm crazy with longing for nature scenes if only on paper .
