<p> Moving slowly in the midafternoon heat , 67-year-old Bennie Turner hammers another board into place , sealing up the empty windows on the ruins of what once was Bryant 's Grocery and Meat Market . <p> Annette Tribble Morgan , whose family has owned this land for as far back as anyone here can remember , had called Turner , a self-employed carpenter and handyman who 's been working for her family almost that long , when news of the reopening of the Emmett Till case first broke . Since then , a stream of reporters and curiosity-seekers had stopped in Money to view the site where , in 1955 , Till , a 14-year-old Chicagoan visiting relatives in the area , was said to have " sassed " the white storekeeper 's wife , 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant . Morgan wanted the place boarded up to prevent trespassing . <p> Turner does n't mind talking to the out-of-towners as he works . He remembers what happened here and all the rumors that went around at the time . He tells visitors he 's glad the case has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to figure out what really happened , " because so many people here say they know . <p> But asked what he thinks will come of all this renewed interest , he shrugs . <p> " Not much , I expect , " he says as his son Jerry , 25 , hands him another board . <p> He 's about to say more , but quickly falls quiet and turns his full attention to his work . Morgan has driven up in her tan SUV , as she has to do a few times a day to shoo people off the site . <p> " It 's private property , " she says , and " for liability " she ca n't allow anyone to set foot on it . <p> Opinions in Money , and in the other small towns that dot this part of the Mississippi Delta , where Sunflower , Tallahatchie and Leflore counties meet , vary widely on whether it was a good idea to reopen the investigation into Till 's murder . But people here tend to agree on one thing : whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to jail for the crime . <p> In fact , most of those who campaigned for a new investigation say its value is largely symbolic . <p> " We do n't want to see 80-year-olds go to jail , " says Anna Laura Williams , a cousin of Till 's mother , the late Mamie Till Mobley . Williams , of Port Gibson , Miss. , who sent a letter on behalf of Till 's family asking Attorney General John Ashcroft to re-examine the case , says she 's more interested in hearing a full account of what happened 50 years ago than in seeing anyone prosecuted for the crime . <p> Even Hallie Gail Bridges , the assistant district attorney who would likely prosecute any new cases that might result from the re-investigation , does n't seem to expect much . <p> Sitting in her tiny office in the basement of the Indianola courthouse , Bridges says that right now , the investigation consists of FBI agents from the Bureau 's Oxford , Miss. , office trying to track down a transcript of the original trial in which Carolyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milam were acquitted of Till 's murder . <p> " It does n't seem that Tallahatchie County where the 1955 trial was held kept one , " she says , " so one of the things they might do is publicly ask " people with knowledge of the case to come forward . <p> Bridges says investigators have n't yet spoken with any of the people directly involved in the case , because they " do n't want to do any interviews until they know what they 're talking about . " She adds that she herself does n't know much about the case , though she did use the Internet to find a copy of the 1956 Look Magazine article in which reporter William Bradford Huie interviewed Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam . By the time they talked to Huie , the two had been acquitted on murder charges and a grand jury had declined to indict them on lesser charges of kidnapping , so they considered themselves immune to prosecution and confessed to the crime , saying they acted alone . <p> Though reports that a number of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as common knowledge among African Americans in the Delta , and , after being publicized by two recent documentaries , have lately gained currency with federal law enforcement officials , Bridges is n't sure what to make of those allegations . <p> Bryant and Milam " certainly do n't mention it , " she says , referring to the Look article . <p> She says she hopes to see the new documentaries soon , but has n't had a chance to view them so far because " if it 's not on the cooking channel , my husband does n't watch it . " <p> Documentary : 10 involved <p> Based on the interviews he did in making his documentary " The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till , " New York filmmaker Keith Beauchamp says he uncovered evidence that as many as 10 people were involved in kidnapping , torturing and killing Till and later covering up the crime . He says that five of those people are still alive . <p> But David Beito , a University of Alabama history professor who has researched the Till case and contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where that 's coming from . " <p> Willie Reed , a witness at the original trial , testified then that he saw Till in the back of J.W. Milam 's truck , driving in Sunflower County , hours after Bryant and Milam took Till from his uncle Moses Wright 's cabin in Leflore . Reed described seeing four white men sitting in the front of the pickup and Till , with two other black men , in the back . A short while later , he saw the same truck parked outside a shed on the Sheridan Plantation , where Milam 's brother Leslie was the manager . From inside the shed , he heard the sounds of someone being hit . Hard . And screaming . He watched as a man walked out of the shed to get a drink of water . It was J.W. Milam . <p> Moses Wright , too , testified at the 1955 trial . He described Bryant and Milam coming in to his home and demanding to see " the nigger who done the talking . " Wright 's son , Simeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night in the cabin and remembers two or three more people , besides Bryant and Milam , taking part in his cousin 's abduction : a woman , presumed to be Carolyn Bryant , sitting inside the truck , who was heard identifying Till , a man standing on the porch , who seemed to have directed the others to the cabin , and possibly another man sitting in the rear of the truck ready to grab Till when Bryant and Milam brought him outside . <p> Others who were in the cabin that night said Levi " Too Tight " Collins , identified in some reports as Leroy Collins , was there , too . Collins was a black employee of J.W. Milam , who some remember as having also worked for Bryant , cleaning up in the small store in Money . <p> Leslie Milam is dead . So are Collins and Willie Hubbard , who Reed picked out as the two men he saw in the back of Milam 's truck with Till . Another employee of Milam 's , Henry Lee Loggins , who was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from having beaten Till to cleaning up his blood from inside Milam 's truck , is alive and living in Dayton , Ohio . He maintains he had nothing to do with the crime . <p> The only other person mentioned in Reed 's and Wright 's testimony who is still alive is Carolyn Bryant , now 70 . Having divorced Roy Bryant in 1979 , she has since remarried and changed her name several times . She is said to be living in Brookhaven , Miss. , about an hour outside the capital city of Jackson . <p> Asked about the possibility that Carolyn Bryant might become a target of the new investigation , prosecutor Bridges shook her head . " How old is Carolyn Bryant now ? " she said . <p> " She was just an innocent victim , " said Bill Bicket , 65 , who grew up next door to the former Carolyn Holloway in Indianola . The accepted truth about the Till case , Bicket says , is that Till did not just whistle at Carolyn Bryant , as was widely reported at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a date and , when she ran away from him , grabbed her by the waist and told her not to worry , that he 'd been with white women before . <p> " Talking that way to a married woman , " Bicket said , " is something that would have gotten any boy in trouble , white or black . " <p> Till " asked for it , " he says , " He did n't ask to get killed , but he did ask to get slapped around a little bit . " <p> Why revisit the case ? <p> Many in the Delta wish the case had remained closed . <p> John Ed " Jack " Cothran , now 89 , was a Leflore County sheriff 's deputy in 1955 and was part of the original investigation . He was there when Till 's battered body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River and identified by Moses Wright . He questioned J.W. Milam , who admitted to kidnapping Till , but not to killing him . <p> He ca n't understand why anyone would want to revisit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think everyone involved in that case is dead except me , " he said Thursday . <p> Asked if he thought a new investigation , conducted by the FBI , might uncover any new evidence , he said , " No . I do n't think it would . Never have , still do n't . " <p> He believes the 1955 trial was a fair one  --  " I was right there , " he says  --  and the original investigation was thorough . <p> " I know because I did it myself , " he said . <p> But even among those who thought the original trial , when an all-white jury took less than an hour to acquit Milam and Bryant , was unfair , there is little optimism that a new investigation would yield a different result . <p> " This is what you call a classic Mississippi red herring , " said Charles Tisdale , now 78 and the editor of the Jackson Advocate newspaper . Tisdale was a recent University of Chicago graduate , working as a reporter for the Tri-State Defender , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . He 's recently been editorializing about a series of cases in which the deaths of black men have been ruled suicides despite apparent evidence of foul play . He says the reopened Till investigation is merely a politically motivated distraction because " another guy got lynched last week . " <p> " Man , Mississippi has n't changed , " he says , as he recounts his memories of the Sumner trial . <p> Waiting outside the courthouse for white reporters , who were allowed inside , to relay to him what was going on , he and the other black reporters were greeted each day by Tallahatchie County Sheriff Harold Clarence Strider , who 'd say , " Good morning , niggers " as he walked in . <p> " They were some bad white folks , " Tisdale says . " I was scared . " <p> Inquiry shows ' metamorphosis ' <p> Others hold out the new investigation , which will be run by federal agents who will turn their findings over to local prosecutors , as evidence that much in Mississippi has changed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever do something like that , " said David Jordan , a sharecropper 's son who grew up in Greenwood , about 10 minutes outside Money , and now represents Leflore , Tallahatchie and Holmes counties in the state Senate . " We worked for them . We were loyal . I mean , we knew integration was coming , but things were all right . We did n't think they would do that to a 14-year-old boy . " <p> Now he plans to propose a bill to make the store site in Money into a museum to " show our metamorphosis . " <p> And Jackson city councilman Kenneth Stokes , who , in 2002 , issued a formal apology to Mamie Till Mobley for what happened to her son , is optimistic as well . <p> " As the capital city , we represent the entire state of Mississippi , " he said . " I thought it was time for an apology and I was very proud to do it . Someone should have apologized a long time ago , " he said . <p> Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear our message . By reopening this case , the federal government , working with the state and the counties , I think I see some real teamwork . " <p> Few options for prosecution <p> Because the statute of limitations has run out on all federal and most local charges , prosecutors will have few options in using whatever material federal investigators might bring to them . <p> Virtually the only charge available to them , says Bridges , is murder . <p> Even if Carolyn Bryant was in the truck when her husband and his half-brother took Till from his shared bed in Wright 's cabin or if Henry Lee Loggins later washed Till 's blood from it , it 's unclear whether either of them could be charged with murder . <p> " If it 's going to be judged by any sort of relatively firm evidentiary standards , " says Beito , who has studied the original FBI files about the case and interviewed all the known living witnesses , " I do n't think it 's going to go anywhere . " <p> Bewilderment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped barking at the reporters who come to stand in front of the ruins of Bryant 's Grocery , people wonder what the point of all the attention could possibly be . <p> " Stirring up crap just makes it stink worse , " says the man who works inside the trailer , right next to the store , that serves as the town 's post office . <p> About a mile down the road , a television news producer knocks on the door of Virginia Jones ' home . Jones , a lifelong resident of Money , remembers first hearing about the Till case from her mother who , like her , was born and raised here . Jones ' husband , Johnny , has been here 13 years . <p> It 's hard for him to understand why the case should be reopened . <p> " I guess it makes the old people feel better , " he says , as his wife is interviewed for a network news show .
