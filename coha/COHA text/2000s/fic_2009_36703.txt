I was locking the door to my condo when I sensed them . Sensed them and knew they meant trouble . <p> Securing my keys in the palm of my hand , I immediately reached down and scooped up my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter , Rayna , who was standing to my left . It was an instinctive , protective gesture  --  because I knew this was going to be bad . <p> Then , fearing the worst , I slowly turned . <p> My stomach lurched . Standing behind me were two very large men . One African-American , one Caucasian . Both looking like they abused steroids and had just escaped from prison . <p> " Vanessa Cain ? " the white man asked , his voice raspy . Harsh . <p> I swallowed . Stalled for time . <p> " You are Vanessa Cain , right ? " the man continued . Tattoos covered both of his forearms , which did n't exactly give me a warm and fuzzy feeling about him . <p> Nerves had me shifting my weight from one foot to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're here to help you vacate Tassie Johnson 's condo , " the black man said , his words sounding like a threat . <p> I chuckled nervously as I met his stern gaze . " Excuse me ? " <p> " It 's time you leave , " he told me . " And never come back . " <p> " This is my home . " I pressed my face to my daughter 's . " Our home.You would n't take a mother and child from their home , would you ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , Ms. Cain , " the white man said . " We 're simply following orders . " <p> " Whose orders ? The court 's  --  or Tassie 's ? " <p> " It 's time , " the black man began , " for you to leave.Tassie will send you your things . " <p> " Oh , is n't that sweet of her ? " I retorted sarcastically . " You want me out of here ? You show me a court order . This is America.You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Neither man seemed swayed by what I said . In fact , they both took a menacing step toward me . <p> " Wait ! " I cried . " Do n't do this . " <p> " It 's time for you to leave , " the black man said again . <p> Was that the extent of his vocabulary ? Was he a robot programmed to say only six words ? <p> The men took another step in unison , now invading my personal space . " But  --  but you ca n't , " I sputtered , clutching Rayna to my chest while trying to block the men from getting to my condo door . They were n't just big  --  they could easily compete in sumo wrestling . <p> The big , bald , white guy wrapped his fingers around my upper arm . " Hey ! " I protested . " You ca n't touch me ! That 's assault ! " <p> " Then move out of the way , " the man said . <p> Rayna began to cry . Tears filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Do n't you have a heart ? How  --  how can you be so cold ? " I cradled Rayna 's head to my shoulder to comfort her as she cried . Neither man batted an eye . I wondered if Tassie had hired them from Rent-A-Thug . <p> " I have a baby , " I went on . " You can actually kick me out of my home with no concern at all for my child ? " <p> " We have our orders , " the men said in unison . <p> " Please , " I begged , as Rayna cried louder . " Please , have a heart . " One man took hold of my left arm , the other my right arm , which was secured around Rayna . " No , " I said defiantly . " Nooo ! " <p> I backed up until my body was against the door . I wriggled around , fighting to free myself . And then my eyes popped open . It took me a good couple of seconds to realize that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thugs were n't in the room with me . I was sitting up , my body tangled in my sheets . <p> I 'd been dreaming . Thank God . <p> I let out a relieved chuckle . <p> But my relief was short-lived . Because reality came crashing down on my shoulders , knocking me backward onto the pillow . Tassie Johnson , my late fiancT 's estranged wife , wanted me out of the home I 'd shared with her husband . Yes , it 's a crazy and convoluted story , but I did n't know that Eli Johnson , my fiancT , was still legally married at the time I was involved with him . He 'd romanced me , seduced me , then proposed.We 'd moved in together and had been planning a life together . How was I to know that he had an estranged wife and a couple kids somewhere ? But Tassie did n't believe me  --  or maybe she did , and she just did n't care . All I knew was that as his official widow , she was making my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tassie had insisted that I buy out her husband 's share of the condo , an all but impossible feat for a single mother like me . But despite the unlikelihood of me coming up with that kind of cash , I had . Only now that I 'd come up with a way to buy her out and get her off my back , she up and changed her mind and changed the game . <p> The sound of my door opening drew my gaze in that direction . The moment Rayna saw me , her face erupted in a smile . <p> Mine did , too . <p> " Mommy ! " she cried , and sprinted toward me on the bed . <p> " Morning , sweetheart . " I reached for my daughter and pulled her onto the bed with me . I hugged her against my chest tightly . <p> " It 's morning , " Rayna went on , her way of telling me that it was time for me to get out of bed . <p> " Yes , it 's morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  7:12 a.m . <p> It was the perfect time to get up  --  if I was heading to work . But it was a Sunday morning , the perfect time to sleep in . <p> My nightmare had gotten me up , and now that Rayna was awake , I was up for the day . <p> I lay down with Rayna , tucking her against my side . Maybe we 'd both drift off . <p> " Mommy ? " Rayna said , her little voice sounding serious . <p> " Yes , sweetie ? " <p> " Want Daddy . " <p> " Oh , baby . " I hugged her small frame . " I know you do . " <p> Eli had n't just been my fiancT , he 'd been a father figure to my daughter , whose own father had abandoned her while I 'd been pregnant . Since Eli 's death a few months earlier , Rayna had n't really asked for him much . I knew she missed his presence , and I 'd tried to explain to her about heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really understand that he 'd never be coming back . <p> " Want Daddy come home , " she said . <p> " I know , baby.We miss him a lot . And I 'm sure he misses us , too . But we ca n't feel sad about that , remember ? Because he 's in heaven , a very beautiful place , and he 's happy there . " <p> " Want to go heaven , " Rayna said , pouting . <p> " You will , one day . One day , we all will go to heaven.And you 'll see daddy again . " <p> Given the adulterous circumstances of Eli 's passing and the numerous lies he 'd told me , I doubted we 'd be reunited beyond the pearly gates . But Rayna did n't need to know that . She never needed to know the ugly truth about what had happened . Some things , children deserved to be protected from . <p> I pressed my lips to Rayna 's forehead , feeling a moment of sadness for her sake . Eli 's public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , because of that , I 'd had to quickly put the pain of his betrayal  --  being killed while in the arms of another woman  --  behind me . Certainly for my daughter 's sake , because she 'd needed me to be strong . <p> But I felt for her , worried for how she was dealing with Eli 's sudden loss in her tiny heart . <p> " You want to go to the zoo today ? " I suggested . " See all the animals ? Maybe Amani can come with us . " Amani was my babysitter Carla 's daughter , and she and Rayna were only a year apart . They were playmates each day when I was at work . <p> Rayna clapped her hands together . " Party , party ! " <p> The last time we 'd been to the zoo , five months earlier , we 'd gone for Amani 's birthday party . Which is why Rayna was associating another visit to the zoo with another party . <p> " It wo n't be a birthday party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun.We can take that train around the zoo.And you can play at the park . " <p> Rayna nodded enthusiastically . " Zebras ! " <p> " Yes , you 'll see lots of zebras . " Rayna was a huge horse-and-pony fanatic , and had n't wanted to leave the zebra exhibit the last time we 'd been to the zoo . She literally could have stayed there for hours and been content . " And maybe after we can go to the lake and feed the ducks . " <p> " Feed ducks , feed ducks , " Rayna chanted . <p> There were countless small lakes in South Florida , most with ducks and herons and cranes . The ducks , of course , were the only animals that cared to get close to humans . Bring food , and you were their best friend . I enjoyed seeing Rayna 's face light up when she tossed bread to them , getting a thrill out of the ducks surrounding her feet for a feast . <p> Yes , Rayna and I would spend a fun day together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of our minds . <p> I decided I 'd wait until ten to call Carla about going to the zoo , it being a Sunday morning and all . On the weekends , I did n't like to phone people too early . It was sort of an unwritten rule with friends and family : I did n't call them before ten in the morning , and they did n't call me . In fact , I liked to laze around in my pajamas most of the morning , sometimes later . <p> When Eli had been alive , Sunday mornings had often become family bed time , with me , him and Rayna in our bed , watching the Disney Channel , snuggling and giggling  --  not having to worry about interruptions from the outside world . <p> So I was a little surprised , when , at 8:40 a.m. , my phone rang . <p> I snatched the receiver off of the wall base in the kitchen , where I was mixing batter for pancakes . Seeing my sister 's number on the caller ID and given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay . <p> " Hello ? " I said . <p> " Morning , Vanessa . " <p> My sister did n't sound stressed . " Morning , Nikki . " <p> " I hope I did n't wake you . " <p> " No , you didn't.What 's up ? " <p> " Well " she began , then hesitated . <p> I frowned . Maybe everything was n't okay . Was my sister having a problem with her husband , Morris ? They 'd gone through a brief rough patch , but as far as I knew , they were blissfully in love again . <p> " Nikki ? " I prompted . <p> " I have something to ask you . Something important . " <p> " Okay , " I said cautiously . <p> " I know this is going to seem a bit weird , but given everything that 's happened , I think it 's right . " <p> " Just tell me already . " <p> " All right . " Now , I heard a smile in my sister 's voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid of honor at my wedding ! " <p> It took a good couple of seconds for my sister 's words to register . And then I was confused . <p> Considering she was already married . <p> " Your what ? " I asked . <p> " My wedding , " Nikki repeated . <p> " You already had one of those . Eight years ago . " <p> " I know , silly , " Nikki said . " But Morris and I are renewing our vows . " <p> " You are ? " I asked , my voice a croak . Not because I was n't happy for my sister , but because I vividly remembered her first wedding . It had been a very elaborate and expensive affair . Mostly , I remembered how my sister had turned into Bridezilla as she planned the most important day of her life . She complained about practically everything . The floral arrangements were n't big enough , not pretty enough , the bridesmaids dresses were too long , then too short.The menu changed at least once a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-the-top elaborate on a scale that only celebrities typically indulge in . Anyone who tried to reason with her  --  namely , me , Morris and their wedding planner  --  got an earful and often a bout of tears thrown in on top of that . <p> Nikki is my only sibling , and eight years my senior . She can be trying on a good day , but when she 's stressed out , she 's pretty much unbearable . <p> " I know what you 're thinking.That a second wedding now is at least fifteen years too soon . But after Morris 's indiscretion , we felt it was best to have a brand-new start.You know . " <p> " Hey , you have to do what you need to do , " I said . If she felt a renewing of vows was in order , who was I to argue ? " What are you thinking ? A small ceremony somewhere ? " Hopefully a city hall wedding , where she could n't be too demanding . A justice of the peace could marry them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headaches that would come from a bigger wedding . <p> " Nothing too big , " Nikki said . " Maybe seventy-five or a hundred people . " <p> " What ? " <p> " And it 's got to be on the beach . I said I want to go somewhere exotic , like Thailand . But Morris says the Keys will be fine , or maybe Jamaica or the Bahamas . " <p> Was my sister serious ? Or was she pulling an early morning prank ? I did n't know what was worse  --  that she thought one hundred people constituted a small wedding , or that she expected a hundred people to travel across the world to Thailand for her second " once in a lifetime " day . <p> That had been her mantra the first time around.That she needed this extravagant thing , or that impossible to get thing because it was for her " once in a lifetime " day . <p> How nice she got to have two . <p> " Are you serious about Thailand ? " I asked , half-chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " <p> " What 's wrong with Thailand ? " she asked , sounding a little dismayed . <p> I felt the headache coming on already . Bridezilla Part Two . Oh , the joy . <p> " I hear Thailand is one of the most beautiful places in the world , " my sister went on . <p> " I 'm sure it is but I do n't think anyone has ever traveled there to have what they 'd describe as a ' small ' second wedding . Seventy-five to a hundred people ? That 's not a small wedding , sis . " <p> " What 's wrong with you ? " Nikki asked . " Are n't you happy for me ? " <p> " Of course I 'm happy for you . I 'm very happy that you and Morris are staying together and that you 're working things out . It 's just  --  " <p> " That it hurts you to see me having a second wedding when you have n't even had your first ? " <p> I gritted my teeth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I spoke , I did n't say something I would end up regretting . <p> " No , " I began . " I was going to say that what you 're proposing sounds very expensive . A small , intimate wedding at city hall would accomplish the exact same thing . A renewal of your vows . And if you still want to go to Thailand , go for your second honeymoon . " <p> Silence . Nikki must have been mulling over my suggestion . <br> Continues ...
