In his day , Michael Jordan lived for vengeance , whether the affront to him was real or imagined . So , too , does 19-year-old Kwame Brown , who was certain he was not the Washington Wizards ' first choice  --  " a scrub " is how he thought they viewed him  --  as they considered their options for the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft . When Brown arrived in Washington 12 days before the draft for his second meeting with team president Jordan and his staff , no one was at the airport to meet him . The driver who finally showed up was n't sure where he was supposed to deliver Brown , and when Brown reached his hotel , he was told there was no reservation for him . It turned out that his last name had been misspelled . " How can you not get that right ? " Brown says . // The slipups , however , did n't bring out the worst in Brown ; he 's not the type to be petulant . No , Brown used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chief rival in the draft , 7-foot high school star Tyson Chandler . When Brown arrived at Washington 's practice facility , he ran into Chandler , who let him know that he 'd been meeting with Jordan 's people for two days . Kwame-come-lately was then told to wait on the sideline as the Wizards put Chandler through an individual workout . " It was like they were coaching him  --  ' Come on , Tyson ! '  --  like he was their player already , " says Brown . With a shrug he adds , " So then I went out and killed him . Killed him . " // If Jordan was looking for a competitor reminiscent of himself , he saw glimpses of one that June day as the 6 ' 11 " , 250-pound Brown repeatedly lowered his thick shoulders and dismantled the 235-pound Chandler one-on-one . When the Wizards said they had seen enough , Brown walked over to Jordan , his hero , and vowed , " If you draft me first , I 'll never disappoint you . " Before turning away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the not-so-distant future : " And I 'll beat you . " // The Wizards , who on June 27 made Brown the first high school player to be chosen No. 1 , maintain that he was wrong to think they had their hearts set on Chandler . Nonetheless , assistant general manager Rod Higgins likes hearing that Brown reacted to the perceived slight as Jordan would have . " If that 's the competitive nature Kwame has , " Higgins says , " then he 's off to a good start . " // Growing up in the shrimping town of Brunswick , Ga . ( pop . 16,433 ) , Brown would watch Jordan on TV whenever he could , learning from his example and drawing strength from whatever similarities to His Airness he found . His competitiveness and poise may change the perceptions of those opposed to high school players leapfrogging college and going directly to the NBA . Though Brown declared for the draft the night before his senior prom at Glynn Academy , he appears to be as centered , mature and reasonable as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their heads , beginning with the one about young men in households where the father is absent : His circumstances actually improved significantly when his father left . Kwame was six or seven years old when the police came to his Charleston , S.C. , home and arrested Willie James Brown on a criminal charge that Kwame can not recall . What he does remember is that it was the last time they saw each other . Kwame 's mother , Joyce Brown , who has said she was beaten by her husband , soon moved with her eight children out of Charleston , eventually ending up in her hometown of Brunswick . In 1990 Willie was sentenced to life without parole for murdering his 22-year-old girlfriend with an ax handle and burying her in a shallow grave along a suburban Charleston road . // " He 's pretty much dead to me , " Kwame says of his 59-year-old father . He has heard that Willie would like to renew their relationship , now that his son is guaranteed more than $9.9 million over the next three years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicts that Kwame will someday visit Evans Correctional Institution in Bennettsville , S.C. , and confront his father , it is not high on his list of priorities . " He used to beat all of us , " says Kwame , the second youngest of the eight children . " He would tell us , ' I gave my life to the devil . ' We could n't say anything about God , about church  --  nothing . He would pick up whatever he could find and beat you or spank you . The next day he would come home from work with a gift for you . I do n't know why . I guess that was how he would try to buy your friendship . " // The relief the family felt when Willie was arrested was tempered by the realities of life without the regular paycheck he earned as a truck driver . Joyce did the best she could by finding work as a maid at the Brunswick Days Inn . While raising her children , she suffered from high blood pressure , lost a kidney to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After living hand-to-mouth for so many years , Kwame has a hard time imagining himself wasting money , no matter how much he is paid . " Invest it right and do n't spend money on all those stupid little chains everybody wears , and you 'll be all right , " he says . // Yet as recently as three years ago , admits the apparently levelheaded Brown , he was following the path of his father . " I could be in prison right now , " he says . " I grew up around a bunch of violent people , and if anybody did something wrong to me , I would hit the person . The payback for anything was physical abuse . " // One symptom of Brown 's lack of direction was his poor performance in school , which led him to Williams during his sophomore year . The associate director of The Gathering Place , a ministry for teenagers in Brunswick , Williams filled the role of the father Brown never had . " He was just a lazy guy , " says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the books . Brown made honor roll in his last four semesters and qualified to play for Florida , whose scholarship offer he accepted last summer before deciding to enter the draft . Brown also joined the church , sang in the choir and two years ago was baptized by Williams . Mr. John , as Brown refers to him , even cuts his hair . // In the last of his four years as a starter at Glynn , Brown averaged 20.1 points , 13-3 rebounds and 5.8 blocked shots . Beyond his physical skills , he impressed NBA scouts by demonstrating a good rapport with his less gifted teammates . Brown says he never realized he might be the best high school player in the country until last summer , when he began to meet the bigger national names . Against fellow lottery selections Chandler ( the No. 2 pick ) , Eddy Curry ( No. 4 ) and DeSagana Diop ( No. 8 ) , he more than held his own . // Unlike most other high school draft choices of recent years , Brown has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength will increase as he begins lifting weights regularly for the first time . He did n't fill out until this year  --  " I was n't 200 pounds until I was a junior , " he says  --  by which point he was already a deft ball handler with a reliable midrange jumper . " Everybody in the NBA has to have a great jump shot , " he says . " If I develop mine more , I could even play some small forward . " // Again , he uses Jordan as his model , noting that he perfected the turnaround shot that made him unstoppable . " What Mike did , he found out what his weaknesses were , and he kept working on them until he did n't have any , " Brown says . " That 's what I need to do . " // Jordan has already invited his new prot ? g ? to his estate in suburban Chicago for 10 days of well-heeled boot camp in August . " The guy took probably the biggest risk of his life , picking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm conscious that if I screw up , I 'm messing with Michael 's reputation . I know he 's going to work me to death . " // When they sat together during a press conference in Washington after the draft , Brown playfully repeated his vow to beat his boss . " That is a dream , " responded Jordan . This is a relationship unlike any Jordan has experienced in basketball . After spending a career making sure he was the preeminent player in the game , Jordan now finds it in his own best interests to make Kwame Brown the league 's best . Little did young Kwame imagine , as he was watching his idol on TV all those years ago , that he would be the one chosen by Jordan to extend his legacy . // Says Williams , who knows a bit about the big picture , " I really do n't think it 's an accident it 's turned out this way .
