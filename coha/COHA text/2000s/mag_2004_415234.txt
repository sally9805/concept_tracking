As its model number tells us , the Model 1885 Winchester first appeared over a century ago . In fact , well over a hundred thousand were made before it was discontinued in the 1920s . Based on an original John Browning patent , for which he was reportedly paid $8,000 , the M-1885 was built in a variety of sizes and configurations that can be generally divided into two categories : High-Wall and Low-Wall . The larger and stronger High-Wall class usually came in heavy calibers , up to and including the .50/140 Winchester Express , while the petite Low-Wall was reserved for smaller rimfire and centerfire calibers . The Low-Wall , like its larger brother , came in far too many variations to list here and over the years gained a reputation as a solid and reliable rifle for target and small game . Like all early Winchesters , these guns are now eagerly sought by collectors willing to pay well more than a thousand dollars for certain variations in good condition . Which is just one reason Winchester has reintroduced a Japanese-made version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .17 HMR , which , when offered in a Low-Wall configuration , makes for a good-looking , fun rifle to take into the field . For accuracy testing , we mounted a scope on our test sample Low-Wall ( the model comes drilled and tapped for scope bases ) . While accuracy was not as good as that of some .17 HMR bolt-action rifles we 've tested , it is plenty good enough for targets as small as prairie dogs out to 100 yards and a bit beyond . Fit and finish of its blued octangular barrel and receiver were excellent , and the action was crisp and tight . If there is a complaint to be made , it is the added-on rotation safety mechanism , which is ugly and difficult to operate . But perhaps few will bother with the safety ; after all , on a hammer gun the hammer is the safety . But its safety mechanism aside , this pretty rifle represents a legendary era of American gun making and should fit nicely into any modern shooting program .
