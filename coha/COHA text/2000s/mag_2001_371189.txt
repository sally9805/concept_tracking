During my long walk home Tuesday , it was on a block of lower Third Avenue  --  that is , the Bowery  --  that I first felt reassured . All the storefront missions were hopping , their doors wide open . The mission workers were on the sidewalk exuding matter-of-fact competence as they offered their services  --  water , bathrooms , food , telephones , first aid  --  to the thousands of anxious strangers passing by . A few of the regular clientele , people accustomed to walking the streets dazed and dirty , stood aside , watching their temporarily down-and-out fellow citizens accept handouts . <P> New Yorkers are known for being jaded , and they are , but the iconic toughness is also a pose . It is n't just a matter of 8 million cynics who turn out to be romantics when you scratch them . As a practical matter , living here requires some willed sangfroid because living here also requires , more than anywhere else in America , an exhausting everyday vulnerability . We travel on subways packed shoulder to shoulder with exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxis we put our lives in the hands of other random strangers who may or may not speak our language or know where they 're going . We walk down sidewalks insanely dense with people and data , sidestepping peddlers , beggars , dog turds and gaping steel holes that descend into basement caverns . We live in a teeming throng , exposed . And we like it that way . Because life in the open has two sides : we make ourselves vulnerable to ugliness and annoyance and danger because that 's the price of remaining vulnerable to serendipity and beauty and even the odd epiphany . <P> We come here and stay , as E.B. White wrote of New Yorkers after the last World War , because we 're " willing to be lucky . " We 're game . And lately in this city , as crime has plummeted and Wall Street has flourished , it has been easy to forget that luck , like vulnerability , has a flip side . A willingness to be lucky implies a willingness to be unlucky . As a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 5,000 lives have been saved over the past eight years . And now : 5,000 murders in one day . <P> In fact , White 's willingness to be lucky  --  by which he meant pluck and hustle  --  is the American predisposition . Everyone ( including us New Yorkers ) tends to think of this place as radically unlike the rest of America . But now we know differently . Wide-open , vulnerable New York was targeted with such staggering precision and viciousness because the city , more than any other , actually does live up to the demonic Taliban caricature . We are the bin Ladenites ' worst nightmare . We are rich . We swagger . We enjoy ourselves . From Wall Street to the media conglomerates of Midtown to the vast immigrant neighborhoods in all the boroughs , we embody the power and the glory of globalization . We are a profoundly secular city ; nowhere else in America are people freer to worship their own gods or to be godless . No place outside Israel has more Jews . Blasphemy is common , irreverence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eccentric ideas and profane entertainment flourish . Women do just as they please . <P> In other words , the terrorists attacked us for precisely the reasons we choose to live here . And , we can only hope after all this , choose to stay  --  still willing to be lucky .
