<p> At 12:01 a.m . Saturday , their fingers will race across the pages of J.K. Rowling 's final Harry Potter installment . They 'll be dressed - just like Potter - in wizard robes and Hogwarts school uniforms as their fingertips absorb the raised-dot combinations known as braille . <p> Potter 's much-awaited fate will be revealed to these blind children at Boston 's Midnight Madness party at the National Braille Press ( NBP ) . It will be a time of celebration , as the party marks only the second time braille readers have had simultaneous access to a new Harry Potter book release . <p> But these braille-literate children are a clear minority in the blind community . The NBP estimates that today only 12 percent of 55,000 legally blind children in the United States can read braille - named for founder Frenchman Louis Braille . Although the number does not account for those cognitively unable to read , the literacy rate is down significantly from 50 percent in the 1960s . <p> It seems the time , effort , and money it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less expensive and less time-consuming audio and computer aids . To many within the blind community , this trend holds serious ramifications . <p> " Literacy is the biggest single determinant of a person 's ability to be successful , " says Steven Rothstein , president of Perkins School for the blind in Watertown , Mass . " If literacy rates had gone down for the general population , there would be a political uproar in this country . " <p> Mr. Rothstein estimates that braille literacy is closer to 20 percent and considers the decline an " enormous crisis " requiring a civil rights movement for America 's disabled . <p> According to statistics from the American Foundation for the Blind , only 32 percent of the blind in the US are employed . But several studies indicate that at least 90 percent of that population who hold jobs are braille literate . <p> The decline in literacy is generally linked to the 1973 Rehabilitation Act , which mainstreamed blind students into public schools where teachers were often unprepared to teach them . Today about 85 percent of blind schoolchildren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Federation of the Blind , 33 states have enacted bills promoting braille instruction within K-12 school systems . <p> NBP vice president Tanya Holton says this " grass-roots " effort began in the late 1980s when blind adults became concerned that American youth were not receiving adequate braille instruction . She says guardians should be educated about such legislation and prepared to fight for braille education . <p> Trials in seeking better teaching in schools <p> Stephen Yerardi , class president of Perkins 's 2004 graduating high school class , soberly recalls his family 's fight for braille education in the New Hampshire public school system when he was 9 . He says teachers suggested a " life-skills program " with no academic instruction and no hope for college . <p> " I hated going to school , " Mr. Yerardi says by phone . " The teachers did n't really understand how to teach me , and they were kind of negative toward me . " <p> Yerardi says he received braille instruction just twice a week - significantly too little time , he says - from a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no experience teaching a blind student , " he says . " I was the only person with a physical disability in nine towns . " <p> At age 13 , Yerardi says school system administrators paid for his instruction at Perkins after coming to the conclusion that they could not provide adequate resources . <p> Consistent braille and computer instruction at Perkins changed his academic future , he says . As a dean 's list student at Keene State College where he will be junior this fall , Yerardi reads textbooks using a PAC Mate personal digital assistant with audio instruction and a refreshable braille display . He plans to teach technology to the blind after he graduates in 2009 . <p> Technology brings braille to PDAs <p> The fusion of braille and technology presents an intriguing challenge to the blind community . Some worry that the growing emphasis to modernize will eliminate braille , but this worry is not evident at the Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton , Mass . <p> On the last Friday of June , three collegiate students gathered in a small classroom with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mr. Charlson praises the technological advances he 's seen during the past decades . Gone are the days when students had to manually make dot combinations with styluses or Perkins Braillers , the common braille typewriter . Now students can electronically scan pages and translate them to braille with Duxbury translation software . They can even print the pages with braille embossers . Refreshable braille displays with changing dot combinations , sleek voice recorders , and the JAWS computer screen-reading program are just a few options available for blind students . <p> Charlson points to large volumes of braille books in his office shelves . The books are expensive to produce because of the thick paper and size requirements , he says . Unlike print , braille can not be reduced in size . <p> So when the Hogwarts aficionados leave the Midnight Madness party early Saturday morning , they each will be toting the 10 braille volumes that make up Potter 's final adventures in " Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . " Each set weighs 12 pounds and costs about $62 to produce , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the book in an effort to promote parity . <p> " When everybody talks about technology killing braille , it 's the other way around , " Charlson says of refreshable braille displays . " Technology is growing braille , because braille is no longer an issue of size . It 's still an issue of expense , though . " <p> All three students in Charlson 's class say their public school districts funded their Carroll technology class . All know braille , and all have expensive refreshable braille personal digital assistants . And Charlson says each pupil is an example of how such opportunities are " exclusively " available for students or the employed . He reiterates that about 70 percent of the blind population is unemployed and will not have access to such expensive technology . <p> Renn Bailey of Albuquerque , N.M. , enrolled in Charlson 's class to prepare for his freshman year at the University of New Mexico . The New Mexico Commission for the Blind provided his BrailleNote - a note-taking device with refreshable braille display and audio instruction . The latest version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social studies book in audio once , and it was terrible , " he says of his preference for reading rather than listening . <p> Mr. Bailey 's classmate Danielle Senick of Norwich , Conn. , says she read her first braille book at age 5 . Ironically , the book was about the man who changed blind literacy and opened the door to her education . <p> " I remember sitting out on the porch at this family gathering and everyone was like , ' Read us a book , ' " says Ms. Senick , a soon-to-be freshman at Curry College in Milton , Mass . " So I read them this book about Louis Braille . I 've used braille a lot ... for pleasure , for education . I just feel I 'd be lost if I did n't know how to read it . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 .
