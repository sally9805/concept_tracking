That 's right , anything . Even replant an entire forest . That 's what one North Carolina Scout troop did after stormy weather destroyed hundreds of trees . // A ferocious ice storm ripped through Randleman , N.C. , in 2002 , tearing out nearly 400 loblolly pine trees in the town 's Woodmen of the World Summer Youth Camp . Some trees were uprooted , and others were so damaged they could n't be saved . Broken tree limbs and trash littered the camp . Star Scout Mark case Jr. , Troop 532 in Randleman , saw the devastation and knew it was time for action . But what should be done ? Loblolly pines have roots that grow close to the surface of the ground . If other loblolly trees are nearby , they will intertwine their roots like the weaving of a blanket . When one tree falls , others are often pulled out of the ground with it . Replanting the area with another type of tree that could better handle such storms seemed to be a good idea . So Mark decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could learn about different species of trees and shrubs . " I was doing a project for school on how to change the world by helping your community , " says Mark , 14 . He quickly realized he would need the rest of Troop 532 to get the work done . It did n't look as if this was going to be a one-man job . Fund-Raising First With the help of his parents , Mark went looking for donations from local and national organizations . He collected money from the Woodmen of the World lodges across North Carolina , and the Points of Light Foundation gave $500 . The $1,500 collected went to buy trees and tools for his project . Mark also asked arborists ( tree experts ) to help him pick the best trees and shrubs . // " I had to learn about the surface of the ground , and I had to plan how much fertilizer to use for each tree , " Mark says . " We have red clay soil here , so we needed to put in a lot of fertilizer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Join Hands Day , a national day for adults and children to volunteer together , would be a good day for the planting project . ( You can visit www.joinhandsday.org for more information . ) On that day , Mark was hoping a few volunteers from his community would come to help his troop with digging and planting . Imagine Mark 's surprise when more than 90 people showed up to plant trees ! // ' The youngest was around 7 , and the age range went all the way up to about 60 , " Mark says . " Everyone worked hard , planting maples , oaks , cypress and dogwood trees . " Planting for the Future With the help of his dad , Mark showed the Scouts how to plant the trees so they would grow strong and tall . Then the Scouts formed teams with other volunteers to share what they learned about planting . It took about three people to dig , plant , fertilize and stake each 6- to 10-foot-tall tree . " It 's a lot harder to plant a bigger tree than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 12-year-old brother . Other Scouts interested in planting trees , Matthew says , " need to be prepared for a lot of digging and getting dirty . " But the result is more than worth the effort . The fruits and leaves from trees provide an important source of food for animals . Trees also provide a source of moisture by releasing water into the air through a process called transpiration . Arboretums provide a place for people to gather and appreciate the importance of our forests . And they 're fun to look at , too . " It felt good to help the environment , " says 14-year-old Life Scout Chris Millner . " I learned about the trees I planted . And how we would n't have to just look at open space at the camp . We could see beautiful trees . It was a lot of work , but I would do it again . " Out of 92 trees that were purchased or donated for the project , 59 were planted on Join Hands Day . The rest were planted later that fall or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2003 , Mark 's Join Hands Day project won a National Award of Excellence from the Points of Light Foundation . he earned a plaque and $1,000 for his good work . Troop 532 plans to continue with cleanup and planting projects at the camp . " Other Scouts can do this for their own communities , " Mark says . " If you set your mind to do something you can do anything . It 's like climbing a mountain-you just have to keep moving . " You can do things you never dreamed you could do .

Our forests are a vital part of our planet . Through photosynthesis , trees release oxygen into the air while removing potentially harmful carbon dioxide . When too many trees are destroyed , it drastically reduces the chance of survival for the animals that depend on them . Sidebar Scouts whose troops choose next month 's suggested program theme , Forestry , will learn about the importance of our natural resources , and of the interdependence of forest , range , soil , water and wildlife . Now 's an especially good time to fine-tune your Leave No Trace camping skills . When exploring an area on a hiking or camping trip , use methods that will not leave a mark . Make sure the area is in better shape when you leave than it was when you arrived . Find complete program details in " Troop Program Features , " Vol .
