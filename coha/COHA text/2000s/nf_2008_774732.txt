The Presidency of John and Abigail Adams // 1797-1801 // For the first time , Americans mourned as one . Again and again over the centuries the country would come together in grief or shock  --  the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy , the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center , the death of Franklin Roosevelt . The first of those nation-binding tragedies rocked the public in the last days of the eighteenth century . On December 14 , 1799 , George Washington died . // Of course on that day no stentorian-voiced anchormen broke into regular programming to announce the sudden and unexpected death ; no dramatic stop-the-presses moment marked the passing of the " Father of the Country . " It took some time for the news from Mount Vernon , where Martha Washington had been keeping watch over her husband of almost forty-one years , to reach the rest of the world . First family and friends nearby , then the Congress , still meeting over Christmas in the temporary capital of Philadelphia , received the report of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since soon after the first shots of the Revolution were fired almost twenty-five years earlier . Congress set the official memorial service for the day after Christmas . A Philadelphia woman the next day estimated that four thousand people attended that service  --  led by President John Adams and " his Lady , " the indomitable Abigail Adams . Her husband 's chief adviser , the First Lady knew that this public display would help John Adams politically , and she was nothing if not politically savvy . An important election was in the offing , or as Abigail Adams put it , " a time for intrigue is approaching , " and it could n't hurt the embattled incumbent president to remind the voters of his ties to the Federalist " fallen hero "  --  of the fact that Adams had served loyally as vice president to President George Washington  --  going into a tough campaign against his own vice president , Republican Thomas Jefferson . Abigail , always on the lookout for what she saw as her husband 's best interests , would get out front on this tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // And it soon became clear that the political impact could be huge . The demise of Washington seemed to hold the country spellbound ; especially affected were the women who documented the death in dire accounts . During the Adams presidency , women were beginning to bring their private political views into the public sphere and to publish under their own names . One of them , Judith Sargent Murray , described the scene when the news of the death reached Boston . " The calamitous tidings reached us this morning , " the feminist writer informed her sister on December 23 . " The bells commenced their agonizing peels , the theatre , and museum were shut , balls , festive assemblies and amusements of every description are suspended , ships in the harbor display the insignia of mourning , and a day of solemn humiliation , and prayer , in every place of public worship in this Town is contemplated . " // Instead of huddling around the television , saddened citizens congregated in churches , paraded in processions , printed poems , offered orations , sought mementos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolize the young country . No one was sure that the nation would survive the loss of its first leader . With the perspective of a foreign observer , Henrietta Liston , the wife of the British ambassador , pondered the political repercussions : " It is difficult to say what may be the consequences of his death to this country , " she wrote to her uncle . " He stood the barrier betwixt the northernmost and southernmost states , he was the unenvied Head of the Army , and such was the magic of his name that his opinion was a sanction equal to law . " // As Henrietta Liston suspected , and as Abigail Adams quickly learned , America found Washington 's death unsettling . One of New York 's great social reformers , Isabella Graham , chronicled the impact to her brother abroad : " The city , indeed the United States , have been swallowed up in the loss of Washington , " Graham wrote soon after the official day of mourning , February 22 , Washington 's birthday . By then in hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ceremonies and commemorations . Nothing was too outlandish , too over-the-top for a country steeped in public shows of sorrow . Famed novelist Susanna Rowson , always ready to draw attention to herself , composed one of many dirges droned out at the mock funerals : // For him the afflicted melts in woe , // For him the widow 's tears will flow , // For him the orphan 's prayer shall rise , // And waft his spirit to the skies . // Since no one had ever mourned an American head of state before , everyone was making up the rituals as they went along , with Federalist politicians determined that they last as long as possible . One of those Federalists , Congressman Harrison Gray Otis , knowing that his wife Sally , home in Boston , would be dying to know every detail of what was happening in Philadelphia , described the official memorial service in a letter written from the chamber of the House of Representatives : " Before my eyes and in front of the speaker 's chair lies a coffin covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told her . " In about one hour we shall march attended by the military in grand procession to the German Lutheran Church . " // Years later John Adams admitted that there was more than a little politics underpinning the paeans : " Orations , prayers , sermons , mock funerals " were used by the extremists in Adams 's own party , to promote Federalist issues and to " cast into the background and the shade all others who had been concerned in the service of their country in the Revolution . " The hoopla might have gotten out of hand in Adams 's view , but in fact he and his wife had set the tone for the marathon of mourning . As soon as the news reached the temporary capital and Abigail Adams saw the response : " All business in Congress has been suspended in great measure and a universal melancholy has pervaded all classes of people , " she told her nephew . . . //                 @ @ @ @
