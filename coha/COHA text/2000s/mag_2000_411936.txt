Our neighborhood hammer , Karen , gets exasperated with the rest of us sometimesprobably a lot like yours does . " Let 's try an organized ride ; ' she said one day . " Double paceline , 16 mph average " She sent around an e-mail to schedule it . I thought it might be fun . I have n't done a doublepaceline training ride in probably seven years . Some people in our group had never done one . It 's not that we 're all hacks . We do have the guy who does n't really know how to pedal yet , and the gai who did her first offroad ride just last week . But there 's also the chick who won the expert class of her last mountain bike race by five minutes . There 's a Cat 2 roadie , a retired bike messenger , some velodrome vets . We ride hard . We ride easy , toomaybe more often than we should , but that 's how we ride and it never feels like a chore . Double pacelines can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . You peel off the front in the middle of a conversation , then drift back along the line , swinging onto the rear beside your partner , resuming your conversation as if it never stopped . Any kind of formation-single paceline , echelon-gets that glorious , hidden rhythm when it 's working . You stop thinking about the rhythm and just live it . But only the double gives you that companionship-working your way up the line for your pull , peeling off and reuniting again and again and again . It 's satisfying in such an unexplainable way that I wonder if it connects to some deep part of what makes us human-a need to journey from friends then return home . Or something like that . I could n't wait for Karen 's ride . But I live in the same world you domeetings drag , air conditioners break down , daughters get sick . l missed the big event . The next day , I asked Karen how the ride was . I was jealous . " No one showed up ; ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one structured rideyou guys ride like a bucket of spilled ping-gong balls : ping ! shoop-shoop zing up the road . " We ride exactly like that . Why ? Because so many of us who love cycling spend the rest of our time like ping-pong balls paddled predictably back and forth . Job . Home . Job . Home . Structure is n't the thing that 's missing in our lives . We need the freedom of cycling . We need to take idiotic flyers-and get chased by three or four other idiots . We need that stupid extra climb at lunch instead of coasting back to work on time . A few weeks after we did n't ride the double paceline , I ended up cycling with one of our readers , Frank Tolan , from Chicago . l told him about the double paceline , and he gave me an of-course look . " If we 're not training , " he said , we 're not riding to get somewhere . Most of us ride to get away : ' Yep . I still hope we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I 'm proud no one showed up .
