<p> Q. I understand the writers of the Oscar-nominated best song " Blame Canada , " Trey Parker and Marc Shaimin , have rejected a request that they tone down the song 's lyrics for the Oscar telecast . An impasse ? <p> Ronnie Barzell , Los Angeles <p> A. Sort of . They said the song was nominated as written , and should be performed as written  --  and the Academy can simply bleep the offensive words if it does n't like them . The whole dust-up dramatizes the gulf between common usage and media standards ; one of the words in the song , referring to bodily vapors , is in common use in grade school but can not be mentioned on the Oscarcast . <p> Q. Here 's an idea for the Oscar show presentation of " Blame Canada " that I only hope the Zanucks will attempt to realize . It could be the best " song " number since Isaac Hayes performed " Shaft ! " It should begin with a solo by Anne Murray , who would be joined , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one : Bryan Adams , Celine Dion , Gordon Lightfoot and so on , until it reaches a Canadian crescendo . <p> Jim Emerson , Seattle <p> A. A brilliant idea . Alas , Entertainment Weekly reports that Anne Murray ca n't appear because she has a golf tournament that day . And we all know that a golf tournament is way more important and lots more fun than the Oscars . Here 's my backup plan : John McDermott , the Irish-Canadian tenor from Toronto , should recruit his Three Irish Tenors stablemates and give the song the performance it deserves . <p> Q. How should Oscar-nominated songs be judged ? Should it be based on the song standing on its own , or should the scene it accompanies be taken into account ? I bring this up because I came close to crying while watching the " When She Loved Me " piece in " Toy Story 2 . " I 've never made up my mind whether the reaction was caused by the song , the images accompanying it or a combination of the two . <p> Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs that reinforce the emotional content of scenes have a better chance , because voters are more likely to remember them . My own choice would also be Randy Newman 's " When She Loved Me . " <p> Q. There has been considerable uproar over the slicing and dicing of " American Psycho , " and I do n't mean on the screen . As I live in a remote northern Canadian town , I thought I would not get the opportunity to see this film before the studio was forced to make edits to satisfy the MPAA . But it turns out the Canadian release of the film will be intact . Each province in Canada looks after its own film ratings , and our most populous province , Ontario , has already rated the existing film " R. " How , in the era of free trade , can the MPAA justify an edited version showing in Detroit , while across the river in Windsor , Ontario , the original cut is freely available ? Do you think the MPAA would respond to pressure from studios or theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release in favor of the original version showing in Canada ? Frank McCallum , <p> Fort Vermilion , Alberta <p> A. I doubt it . The two versions are too similar . I have seen the uncut version of " American Psycho . " The MPAA rated the film " R " only after cuts were made in a sex scene that would strike most people as tame in the first place . All the gore and slaughter remain . It 's as if the MPAA was making a symbolic trim to get off the hook of having misapplied the NC-17 in the first place . <p> Q. The DVD version of Stanley Kubrick 's " Eyes Wide Shut " is indeed the censored U.S. theatrical print , but the injustice to this underrated film does n't stop there . Warner Bros. , as per Kubrick 's wishes , will not be releasing the film in wide-screen format . This is the same practice used on the director 's previous two films , " The Shining " and " Full Metal Jacket . " All three films were shot in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film frame being " masked " for theatrical exhibition . When released to TV and video , the full frame of the film is visible , meaning the full width of the film is present , with a hair more information at the top and bottom than could be seen in theaters . All well and good , some might say , but the original theatrical composition is forever lost . Can anyone explain why a filmmaker as meticulous as Kubrick would not only allow but prefer such questionable video treatments of his films ? <p> Louis Gutenberger , Reno , Nev . <p> A. Kubrick preferred his films to fill the video screen , and so he shot them with an eye to compositions that would look good both in theatrical wide screen and on the TV screen , where extra head and footroom is visible . " The framing on the full-screen presentation looks perfectly balanced in every shot , " says the hard-to-please Douglas Pratt in his DVD-LaserDisc Newsletter . The irony is that when wide-screen HDTV arrives , Warners will have to decide how to interpret Kubrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be centered in the wider screen ? <p> Q. Regarding the Answer Man for Feb. 27 : As a " Plan 9 From Outer Space " fan from way back , I can confirm that the music in the " Rear Window " trailer is indeed the main title music from Ed Wood 's epic , although it 's certainly not in " Rear Window " itself . This is not unprecedented : Back in 1988 , when I reissued " The Manchurian Candidate , " the malletheads in MGM/UA 's marketing department simply took the original trailer , wiped the soundtrack and laid in stock music  --  which was instantly recognizable from the original " Night of the Living Dead . " Michael Schlesinger , <p> Sony Classics , Culver City , Calif . <p> A. You 're lucky they did n't look at the title , decide it was a political campaign film and lay in " Happy Days Are Here Again . " <p> Q. I have and continue to build a nice library of VHS videos and am not really interested in DVD . Will I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equipment because I will find no one to repair my VCR , and VHS tapes will no longer be produced , etc. ? I fear technology/the economy-machine is driving our choices and do n't like it . Does one really have a good choice in this matter ? <p> Donald J. Nevin , St. Paul , Minn . <p> A. VHS tapes will continue to prosper for the foreseeable future . The only immediate casualty of DVD is the laserdisc . But eventually DVD home recording machines will become available , and when they become affordable , VHS will fade away , because DVD picture quality is so much better . Personally , I like having the choice . <p> Q. I lost my passion and love for movies . How do I get it back ? <p> Romolo Perriello , New York City <p> A. Start all over again at the beginning . First Buster Keaton , then Chaplin , then you might be feeling good enough for the Marx Brothers . They made a movie with Marilyn Monroe . . . and by now , you 're back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dumber " and " There 's Something About Mary , " the Farrelly Brothers have used the name Mary as the main female character . Seeing that they have only made three major movies , and " Mary " is in two , is this a coincidence , or do they really like someone named Mary ? <p> Jack O'Brien , Rocky Hill , Conn . <p> A. Peter Farrelly tells me : " No . Our mother is named Marion , but that 's not the same . " So it 's just one of those strange unsolved mysteries . <p> Q. I just saw " The Cider House Rules " and was struck at the film 's lack of moral base and its message that lying to yourself and others is good if it kills the pain of human experience . Do you think that maybe that 's the reason this movie lacked any spirit or emotion ? <p> Harry Russ , Dallas <p> A. The movie remains an enigma to me . As I said in my original review , I do n't think it ever decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions rushing wildly in all directions . Its nomination as one of the year 's best films is inexplicable  --  or perhaps explained by the Miramax Oscar machine . <p> Send questions to Roger Ebert 's Movie Answer Man , Box 146829 , Chicago 60614.
