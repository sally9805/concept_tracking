The Truth about Relativity // Why Everything Is Relative  --  Even When It Should n't Be // One day while browsing the World Wide Web ( obviously for work  --  not just wasting time ) , I stumbled on the following ad , on the Web site of a magazine , the Economist . // I read these offers one at a time . The first offer  --  the Internet subscription for $59  --  seemed reasonable . The second option  --  the $125 print subscription  --  seemed a bit expensive , but still reasonable . // But then I read the third option : a print and Internet subscription for $125 . I read it twice before my eye ran back to the previous options . Who would want to buy the print option alone , I wondered , when both the Internet and the print subscriptions were offered for the same price ? Now , the print-only option may have been a typographical error , but I suspect that the clever people at the Economist ' s London offices ( and they are clever  --  and quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulating me . I am pretty certain that they wanted me to skip the Internet-only option ( which they assumed would be my choice , since I was reading the advertisement on the Web ) and jump to the more expensive option : Internet and print . // But how could they manipulate me ? I suspect it 's because the Economist ' s marketing wizards ( and I could just picture them in their school ties and blazers ) knew something important about human behavior : humans rarely choose things in absolute terms . We do n't have an internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth . Rather , we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another , and estimate value accordingly . ( For instance , we do n't know how much a six-cylinder car is worth , but we can assume it 's more expensive than the four-cylinder model. ) // In the case of the Economist , I may not have known whether the Internet-only subscription at $59 was a better deal than the print-only option at $125 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the print-only option at $125 . In fact , you could reasonably deduce that in the combination package , the Internet subscription is free ! " It 's a bloody steal  --  go for it , governor ! " I could almost hear them shout from the riverbanks of the Thames . And I have to admit , if I had been inclined to subscribe I probably would have taken the package deal myself . ( Later , when I tested the offer on a large number of participants , the vast majority preferred the Internet-and-print deal. ) // So what was going on here ? Let me start with a fundamental observation : most people do n't know what they want unless they see it in context . We do n't know what kind of racing bike we want  --  until we see a champ in the Tour de France ratcheting the gears on a particular model . We do n't know what kind of speaker system we like  --  until we hear a set of speakers that sounds better than the previous one . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  until we find a relative or a friend who is doing just what we think we should be doing . Everything is relative , and that 's the point . Like an airplane pilot landing in the dark , we want runway lights on either side of us , guiding us to the place where we can touch down our wheels . // In the case of the Economist , the decision between the Internet-only and print-only options would take a bit of thinking . Thinking is difficult and sometimes unpleasant . So the Economist ' s marketers offered us a no-brainer : relative to the print-only option , the print-and-Internet option looks clearly superior . // The geniuses at the Economist are n't the only ones who understand the importance of relativity . Take Sam , the television salesman . He plays the same general type of trick on us when he decides which televisions to put together on display : // 36-inch Panasonic for $690 // 42-inch Toshiba for $850 // 50-inch Philips for $1,480 // Which one would you choose ? In this case , Sam knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different options . ( Who really knows if the Panasonic at $690 is a better deal than the Philips at $1,480 ? ) But Sam also knows that given three choices , most people will take the middle choice ( as in landing your plane between the runway lights ) . So guess which television Sam prices as the middle option ? That 's right  --  the one he wants to sell ! // Of course , Sam is not alone in his cleverness . The New York Times ran a story recently about Gregg Rapp , a restaurant consultant , who gets paid to work out the pricing for menus . He knows , for instance , how lamb sold this year as opposed to last year ; whether lamb did better paired with squash or with risotto ; and whether orders decreased when the price of the main course was hiked from $39 to $41. // One thing Rapp has learned is that high-priced entr ? es on the menu boost revenue for the restaurant  --  even if no one buys them . Why ? Because even though people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu , they will order the second most expensive dish . Thus , by creating an expensive dish , a restaurateur can lure customers into ordering the second most expensive choice ( which can be cleverly engineered to deliver a higher profit margin ) . 1 // So let 's run through the Economist ' s sleight of hand in slow motion . // As you recall , the choices were : // 1 . Internet-only subscription for $59. // 2 . Print-only subscription for $125. // 3 . Print-and-Internet subscription for $125. // When I gave these options to 100 students at MIT 's Sloan School of Management , they opted as follows : // 1 . Internet-only subscription for $59  --  16 students // 2 . Print-only subscription for $125  --  zero students // 3 . Print-and-Internet subscription for $125  --  84 students //
