Howard has just served us four plates of the best chocolate-chip cookies I 've ever eaten when Warden Burl Cain tells us that Howard killed a man and is going to die an old man in prison for it . It 's flat as that , but it exposes the most intimate , relevant detail of Howard 's life . I do n't want to look at him , but I do , and Howard does n't flinch . Howard 's sad eyes do n't change , do n't feign remorse or regret , just stay sad , and his gold-plated teeth are the only thing that hints he was once a man who would n't let himself be stared at . " I do n't know how Howard killed somebody , and I do n't care , " says Cain about his favorite prisoner . " I care about how he is now . " Even though Louisiana offers no hope for parole , Cain says he believes Howard is rehabilitated and should be freed if he can meet the family of the man he killed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice is as simple and brutal as that , even if he is going to die here in Angola prison . <P> Heaven and hell and sin and redemption are just philosophy to me , a system to make sense out of life . But here in Angola , heaven and hell and sin and redemption are n't philosophy . They are the answers to why you 're here and who you are and where you are going to end up . <P> There are 88 men on death row , and Burl Cain has killed more people than most of them . He has set five down by lethal injection , and he has held each of their hands as they died . One man had track marks so bad they had to shoot the poison into his neck , and he kept bolting upright , so Cain had to push his shoulder down with his right hand while letting the man hold Cain 's left for comfort . The table has five straps on the gurney  --  two leg manacles , two wristbands and one chest belt  --  making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't pointing toward either heaven or hell . Cain says he stayed quiet when he killed his first man and did n't give him a chance to confess and get right with God , and Cain felt him go to hell , felt it in his hand surer than anything he 'd ever known , and it made him commit his life to Christ . " My wife , she does n't like that she 's married a killer , " he says . " This is probably going to end my marriage . " <P> One of Cain 's predecessors , Warden C. Murray Henderson , was recently convicted of shooting his wife five times , and he 's most likely going to wind up in Angola for it . At 18,000 acres , it 's the largest prison in the U.S. , with the lowest-paid guards , few of whom have graduated from high school . It 's a place that Collier 's magazine once called " the worst prison in America , " where in 1951 , in an effort to protest the brutal conditions , 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to work . <P> At the prison museum Cain has built , where all the T shirts , coffee mugs and videos have the name ANGOLA printed in big letters , Cain points his thick fingers at pictures of the men he has executed . " They 're special people to me , " he says .
