I live in Dakar and am certainly present on the scene . Living there gives me a certain inspiration ; it allows me to keep my passion for music alive . There 's a lot of great young talent in Dakar . Every two or three years , I actually produce an album for someone , but I also started a record label called Jololy , and I think that with the passage of time some of these young people are going to do better than I. I listen to a lot of things in the music of today . But I also have a particular weakness for the music of the ' 60s . I listen to a lot of Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding , and Latin music . I grew up close to Latin music in Dakar . I listen to a lot of local music  --  Senegalese music  --  which is rich and diverse in our country . I find myself going back to it all the time . <P> In the beginning , when mbalax a blend of Senegal 's traditional griot percussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was never a question of people saying , " It 's not good ; it 's not well done , " but rather , " We do n't like it . " Later , as success arrived with this music , those who were more traditional began to appreciate that our success could be a window onto traditional music . <P> Traditional music is everywhere in our culture . It 's something that 's very close to the people , so naturally it 's going to bear upon my work because it 's ever present . Traditional music and culture are the environment itself . They 're in the clothes and the ambiance of the street , so they absolutely mark everything that I do . <P> I tend to go for openness and look outward in my musical searching . But recently I feel maybe an obligation to be more of a protector , a guardian , a curator almost , of traditional sounds and music , so lately I 've been working that thought into my albums . However , who knows what tomorrow may bring ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from elsewhere , and all of a sudden my recordings may take a turn that I had n't anticipated . You ca n't really program music . A musical life really should n't have any limits . I do n't really believe in formats , and once you get rid of formats , everything is available to you . When you break out of categories , you automatically encounter new things . It 's from these new experiences that interesting things happen . <P>  --  Reported by Alex Smith
