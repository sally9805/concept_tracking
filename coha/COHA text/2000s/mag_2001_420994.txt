See page 68 for planting directions . // * To plant spring-flowering bulbs is to witness a miraculous transformation . Think about it : You go to the nursery in fall , pluck homely lumps from the bins , drop them into brown paper bags . The glossy color photos above the bins promise beautiful spring blooms in a rainbow of hues  --  elegant , cup-shaped tulips in hot pink and orange , soft pink and lavender ; cheerful yellow daffodils ; voluptuous blue hyacinths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown things with bristly bottoms pushing out such incredible blooms . But plant them well , either by type en masse or with other bulbs , and they 'll surprise you . Plant them in large beds , as shown at right , or in smaller containers , as pictured above . Either way , the results are sure to be spectacular come spring . Tulip day Helen Crawford must have taken lessons from Tom Sawyer . No , she did n't talk her friends into painting her fence , as Tom did , by convincing them she was doing them a favor . Instead , for years she has invited relatives , neighbors , and friends to plant her tulips for her , and every year they come , willingly . Unlike Tom-who only managed this trick once-Crawford has pulled this off for three decades .

The planting date is always the same-the Friday after Thanksgiving ( in this warm Southern climate , bulbs do not winter over ) . Her guests clear their calendars months in advance and often travel great distances to join the fun . ( The Crawfords ' son , Mark , and his wife only have to drive from Pasadena , but their daughter , Tracy , and her family fly in from Washington State . ) Doris and Paul Meyer just walk across the street . They sauntered over out of curiosity in 1973 , during Crawford 's third planting party , and ended up pitching in . They have been back every year since , accompanied by their sons , Greg and Matthew , and daughter , Paula . " Through babies , college , marriage , travel-no matter how widely our family is scattered-we have a bond with that November Friday , " Doris says . " We do n't miss it . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Doris . " Many of the old rituals of our ancestors have lost their meaning , and we have n't replaced them . It 's up to us to invent new ones , as Helen has . " Happy memories of previous planting parties also keep people coming . " I remember how Matthew 's chest swelled with pride when he shoveled dirt with the men for the first time , " says Crawford . It was a rite of passage . Photograph Potted tulips , hyacinths , and daffodils extend the color show right up to the front door ( note the stained-glass tulips ) . Containers are planted four to five weeks later than the rest of the tulips for simultaneous bloom . // " The party has made us an extended family , " says Crawford . " Maybe the bulbs are just an excuse to get together . " In most parts of the West , November is not too late to buy bulbs . Whether you copy Crawford 's party idea and gather a group together or plant on your own , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Crawford plans this annual planting party . * JULY . Crawford orders tulip bulbs from a mail-order bulb company ( she prefers Dutch Gardens , in New Jersey ; 800/818-3861 ) . By ordering early , she ensures she 'll get the bulbs she wants in the quantities she needs . She orders the full range of colors and some of every type ( singles , doubles , fringed , parrot , and so on ) . To extend the color show , she also requests some early- and late-blooming varieties . Until the day of the party , she chills the bulbs in the refrigerator . ( In mild climates , tulips need a minimum of six weeks ' chill before planting . Place them in a paper bag in the crisper section of your refrigerator ; keep bulbs away from apples. ) * NOVEMBER . A few days before the party , Crawford contracts with a manual laborer to help her doubledig half of her tulip bed . She divides the plot into six sections , then has the worker shovel out 8 inches of soil from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . A generous amount of compost , usually homemade , is shoveled into each of the dug-out sections and worked into the next 8 inches of soil , along with a handful of bulb food . This preparatory step means guests can begin planting immediately the day of the party . * PARTY DAY . Once everyone arrives , Crawford distributes bulbs and a few suggestions . " Plant at least 25 of each variety in a group or else the color wo n't read , " she says . She also tells them to plant closely but not too orderly- " This is n't school ; you do n't have to stay in rows . " And leave an exit route : " Start in the center and work to a corner so you can get out without tromping on bulbs . " After the first three sections of the bed are planted , the soil excavated from them is replaced . The men and older boys usually volunteer for this job . Helpers dig out 8 inches of soil from the remaining three sections , piling it atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compost and bulb food to each newly dug-out section , plant the bulbs , and cover them with the excavated soil . Then the soil over the whole bed is gently evened out with rakes . Dispensing rewards is the final step . Appreciation of the ritual may be the main reason guests return to West Palm Drive every year , but the promise of homemade cookies and good English tea afterward does n't hurt . Nonstop flowers ... winter through spring Tina Dixon , of Plants a la Cart in Bothell , Washington , and Marsha Davis-Thomsen of Seattle are not easily discouraged by short days , rain , and persistently chilly weather , Each fall , just when everyone else in the Northwest is giving up on gardening for the season , the two designers whip up winter-intospring plantings in containers .

It looked good almost instantly after planting-and heather foliage and pansy blooms provided color on a front porch through winter . Then , in spring , successive bursts of daffodil , grape hyacinth , and tulip flowers heightened the show . Winter weather near Lake Washington did not faze this collection of plants ; New Zealand flax , the most tender of the plants in the arrangement , is hardy to about 20 . Throughout the cool season , the plants needed no supplemental feeding , and weekly watering was only necessary during dry spells between rains . Costs for this project ( including soil , bulbs , perennials , and fertilizer ) came to about $110 . The sandstone urn costs more , but you can use any large container that catches your fancy , including terra-cotta .
