You love your Ipod . You would n't dream of taking a trip without your digital camera . You 've just started playing around with a digital camcorder . And already your hard disc is bursting with music , picture and video files . Digital gadgets may have become an indispensable part of our lives , but figuring out how to organize and access all that content is a growing headache . At the Demo 2004 trade show in Scottsdale , Ariz. , last week , exhibitors presented several cutting-edge solutions to keep chaos at bay . <P> ALL IN ONE Roxio 's Easy Media Creator 7 is a new software suite that lets you rip a music CD and edit your own home movie and burn it onto a DVD you can send to the grandparents . Available now for $99 ( Windows PCs only ) , it gives users a single interface for handling all their organizing tasks . I especially like the home-movie-creation features , which guide you through the process of editing a video . There 's also a sound editor for adding special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools and a backup feature for saving data files to disc . <P> PC-TV If you want to get your media files closer to the home entertainment center , the new Molino Media Mogul could be a good solution . It 's a set-top box with a 300-GB hard drive that connects to a TV instead of a PC . Using the onscreen interface and a remote control , you can create song playlists and photo slide shows . Hook the unit up to your home network , and you can access Media Mogul files on your PC too . The Media Mogul , available this summer for $995 , has a DVD player , memory-card slots for all types of flash memory and USB and FireWire ports for importing images and video . <P> MEDIA TO GO Storing your music , pictures and videos in one place sounds great  --  except when you 're on the road . That 's why a new company called BravoBrava in Union City , Calif. , is developing AllMiMedia Premium , which will let you remotely access digital-media files from any PC equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking into a hotel , flipping open your laptop and watching any movie from your home DVD collection or playing any song stored on your home PC . Available in late 2004 for owners of Media Center PCs ( a new kind of multimedia PC ) , AllMiMedia Premium will work on cell phones and PocketPCs too .
