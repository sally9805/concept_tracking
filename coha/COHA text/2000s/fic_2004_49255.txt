WHEN MA FINALLY DIED , they said they did n't have a place for me and it was n't safe in the city anymore , so they decided it would be best to send me somewhere west where I could live on a farm . They said I would like it . Hard work and sunshine . And I 'd get over Ma 's death in no time . You 'll see . They said . <p> They put me on a train with a whole bunch of other tight-faced people and went away . The train sat in the station for half a day , all of us waiting scared , before it finally chugged out . It was cold and shivery in the car , and there was n't much to eat . You could get a drink from the faucet , but the water tasted funny . <p> Out the window , there was a lot of smoke , and where there was n't smoke , there was burnt-out buildings , some old , and some still smoldering . I never been on a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no , this was all stop-and-go , mostly stopping and waiting . And when we did go , we went slow , like the driver was being careful to watch the tracks to make sure they was still there . Once we went real slow through a corridor of burning buildings . <p> I was stuck way in the back behind a family , sort of , with a couple of older sisters and a lot of young-uns , except they were n't a real family because they was n't related . They was just traveling together , and the older sisters were n't sisters at all , they was just supposed to keep the little-uns together . The kids all stunk real bad , they did n't have any clean clothes , and they 'd pissed and crapped themselves , more than once . And they cried a lot , trying to keep warm . So I just turned to the window and stared out at whatever there was to see , which was n't very much because once we got away from the big towns , the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mostly the dark looked like black fuzziness floating in the air . I 'd never been inside the dark , but I heard stories . Everybody heard stories . It 's like being shoved inside a thick blanket , you ca n't see , you ca n't hear , you ca n't breathe , and you just stumble around blind . It has something to do with the dark making it hard for things to move , like light or air or blood through your veins . You lay down a couple miles of dark around something and nobody can get through , no matter how much tinfoil they 're wearing on their head . <p> Somebody else said that the whole country was sectioned off now . Dark everywhere . The trains ran through special corridors with walls of dark on each side , just enough room for the tracks and nothing else . You could maybe jump off the train , it was n't going very fast , but so what ? You could n't get through the walls of dark , you could n't go anywhere except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the train . <p> Sometime in the middle of the second night , we got to our first stop and they took some of the people off . There was all kinds of dark here , all around everything , even above so we could n't even look up and see the stars . We did n't know where we were . Even though everybody was real tired , they woke us all up while all these men in different uniforms came marching through . They looked like soldiers from five or six different armies . They pointed at people in their seats . You , you , not you , not you , yes , yes , no , no , and so on . Another man in a different kind of uniform , I think he was the train conductor , came running after them , shouting about how they could n't just take only the workers , they had to take a balanced cross-section , otherwise it was n't fair . <p> I was hoping they 'd take me , I wanted off the train real bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even asked one of the soldier-men to pick me , but he shook his head and said I was too skinny . I tried asking a couple of the others , but they ignored me , so I slumped back down and pulled my blanket up and tried to go back to sleep . There was n't nothing else to do . I was hungry and cold and stinky and not feeling too good inside . But at least there was some empty seats now and if you had one next to you , you could stretch out . <p> We had two more stops the next day , one just before noon , and the other late in the afternoon . Each time , another bunch of soldiers came through and took off some more people . After the last stop , there was almost nobody left on the train so they made us all move to the last car . They did n't say why . But probly because it was easier to watch us all in one place . <p> When they woke us up again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what time it was , somebody said it was 3:30 in the morning . They made us gather up all our things , I did n't have much to gather , and then they herded us off the train and into a fluorescent station . The light hurt my eyes and the room smelled real strong of that disinfectant they use everywhere now . There was a red line across the room and we were n't allowed to cross it . On the other side , there was a line of grumpy-looking people , farmers and townsfolk . I guess they did n't like getting out of bed at this hour either . They looked us up and down like we were something bad-smelling . I guess we were . Every so often , I sort of got a whiff of myself . I felt dirty and itchy , and I wanted a bath or even a shower . My feet hurt and I was shivering in my blanket . <p> The guy who looked like the conductor read a statement to the folks on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they had to treat us , stuff like that . They all looked bored , like they 'd heard it all before . Then he read another statement to us on this side of the line , about our rights and stuff and how we did n't have to go if we did n't want to , but we could n't refuse either . Which did n't make any sense . <p> And then they started letting people pick us . A big farmer pointed at one of the skinny girls and asked her if she could cook and clean . She nodded , and he grunted and said , " Okay , come along , " and she picked up her little suitcase and followed him . There was a sad-looking man and woman , they looked at the two littlest children and whispered together for a while , and then crossed the line and picked them up and left real quick , like they feared someone would n't let them take the babies . <p> It went like that for a while , until there were n't many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across from me . She looked like she 'd been baked in the Sun until all the juice had been burned out of her and all that was left was this dry crunchy thing . She was looking at me like she could n't make up her mind if I was worth the trouble . Finally , she said , " Boy ? Are you gon na work , or you just gon na eat ? " <p> " I can work , " I said . <p> She walked over to the conductor and they talked together for a bit . he shook his head a lot . I got the feeling that I was n't the first kid she 'd picked out . And maybe the other one did n't work out . But finally , whatever , she came back and pointed at me and said , " Get your things . " And that was it . I followed her out through the big double doors to a dirty parking lot surrounded by dark . A couple of tall light poles showed a few cars and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . <p> " You got a name ? " <p> " Folks call me Em . " <p> " Em ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Short for Emmett ? " she asked . <p> " Em for Michael . " <p> " Michael , yes . That 's better than Em . You can call me Miz . " <p> " Yes , Miz . " <p> She pointed toward a beat-up old flatbed truck . She tossed my duffel into the back . I started to climb up after it , but she opened the door for me and said , " Get in . " <p> We drove west on a road that was lined with dark . There might have been stars above , I could n't tell . We had headlights , but they was mostly useless . They picked out the line of the road and that was all . She did n't say much and I did n't feel like talking either . I was too cold . I bunched up part of my blanket like a pillow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse than the train . We must have driven two hours . By the time we got where we were going , there was a feeling of light behind us . Hard to tell though , with all the dark . <p> Then there was a hole in the dark and she turned right and then left and then right again , and then we came out onto a big gray slope leading up to an old gray house . Behind it there was a dirty barn that had once been red , real tired-looking and leaning to one side , like it wanted to lie down , like if you gave it a good hard push , the whole thing would collapse , except there were a bunch of boards jammed in at an angle , propping it up so it could n't . The old woman pointed . " You 'll sleep in there . There 's straw for a bed , and some old horse blankets . You can wash in the horse trough . Do n't bother the cows . I start milking at six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . As soon as the cows are turned out . There 's a couple barrels of disinfectant . You keep those stalls clean , you hear ? As clean as you want your own bed - or your dinner plate . It 's almost six now , so wash yourself up , you stink like a pig . Then get started . After milking , I 'll bring you a plate . Do n't want you in the house , boy . Lord knows what you 're carrying . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " <p> She stopped the car in front of the house , yanked on the parking brake real hard , like she was angry . " You like eggs ? You ever had fresh eggs ? Do n't look like it . You 're thinner than a ghost . When was the last time you ate ? " <p> " Day before yesterday . I think . On the train , they gave us some leather to chew on . " <p> " Damn fools . That 's no way to treat anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Displaced Persons . DP 's . " <p> " Oh . " Remembered my manners . " Thank you for takin ' me in . I 'll work real hard for you , ma'am . " <p> She grunted . " Damn right you will . No free meals out here . Well , do n't just sit there . We got work to do . " <p> After milking and mucking , we pulled down a couple of bales of hay from the loft and broke them open for the cows . There was only three cows and they looked kinda sickly , but I do n't know much about cows , so they coulda been fine too . But they walked real slow and stupid , like some of the people I 'd seen in the city , the sick ones that they 'd herd away every so often . But maybe that 's how cows are . One of them looked at me for a bit , but she did n't look dangerous or anything , I did n't think you could make friends with a cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there was the chickens , there was too many to count , they kept moving around all the time , bobbing their ugly little heads and clucking like old ladies . Miz poured out some corn for them and they all came cackling up . They was funny to watch . Later , after they 'd finished the corn , they wandered around the fenced-in part of the yard , scratching for bugs and worms . <p> The biggest part of my job was feeding the refiner . This was three or four big metal tanks in a row , all piped together like a connected series of garbage disposals . I had to dump all the garbage into it every day , and everything else that was n't nailed down - old corn stalks , dirty straw , stinkweeds , whatever . I had to scrape up the chicken guano and dump it in , plus wheelbarrow loads of cow manure and pig shit . Miz had indoor plumbing , but we both had to use the outhouse , because it pumped right into the refiner too . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel the stove at the bottom . The refiner was a big stinky stew pot , simmering and bubbling , sometimes grinding and chewing . But I did n't mind working the refiner , except for the smell . It was the only time I was really warm . <p> At the far end , out came oil . Enough for the truck , enough for the water heater , enough to power the refiner for another few days . Sometimes there was even enough to sell the extra in town . What did n't get turned into oil came out as mulch . And a scattering of metal bits and rock . The metal bits we saved for town . I had to check the refiner when I got up , twice during the day , and again before hitting the straw . Miz said if we had two more pigs , we 'd be fat . But we did n't have enough corn to feed any more pigs . We were already too close to the bone , she said . <p> Out back of the house , Miz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potatoes and cucumbers and things like that . Some pumpkins and watermelons too . She also had a big patch of corn . Not a whole field , but enough to feed us and the chickens and even some for the cows . Like everything else , though , the corn had a sickly look . " Hard to grow things when there is n't enough light for them . Not good for plants , not good for people either . Still , it'sbetter'ndyin ' . " Shesniffed . " One good thing about the dark , though . We do n't get as many rabbits or foxes sneakin ' in . They do n't like the dark anymore than anyone else . But you still have to watch out for burrows , because sometimes they will dig under . Saturdays , we go to town and get whatever supplies they still got . Sometimes there 's a movie , but do n't be expectin ' it . Sundays , we go to Meeting . When we get back from Meeting , you can have time by yourself . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't go darksniffin ' like the last damnfool I had out here . And no , I ai n't sayin ' nothin ' about that . And do n't you go askin ' no questions neither , if you 're smart . " <p> But I did n't have to ask no questions . There was plenty enough people willin ' to tell me everthin ' they knew . First time we went to town , while I was loadin ' sacks of chemical fertilizer into the back of the truck . Town was n't much , just a scattering of old buildings on one side of the old highway , like someone just dropped them there any which way . Surrounded by dark , of course . Only way in or out is through the corridors , that 's three roads and the train tracks . So there 's not a lot to see . Funny lookin ' kid with a broken tooth comes up and says , " You Miz 's new boy ? " <p> " Guess so . " <p> " You wan na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened to him ? " <p> " I know what I need to know , " I said , pretending to ignore him . <p> " No , you do n't . You 're a city boy . You do n't know shit . " <p> " I know enough to keep my nose outa other folks ' business . " I hefted the last sack in . <p> " You just stay out in the barn , boy , you know what 's good for you . Come winter , she 's gon na want you to come in and warm her bed , you 'll see . Keep yourself bad-smellin ' , that 's what Doey did . Till he ran away - ran into the dark , he did . " <p> Miz came out of the feed store then , saw the kid and her face got real fierce . He saw her the same time and skittered off like the rat he was . Miz came up to me and stared at me hard . " What 'd that boy say ? " <p> Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even on the best of days . I just sorta shrugged . " He said you had another boy named Doey . He ran away . " <p> " That all he said ? " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " <p> She sniffed like she did n't believe me , but she did n't push it . " Well , you stay away from that J.D. boy . He 's bad news . That whole family is . Now get to work . Help me load all this . " <p> Miz explained that the train had come through again , so today was a good day . Some of the stores had new things on the shelves , even some new magazines in the racks . Miz bought a couple , bought one for me too . " Readin ' is good for you , as long as you do n't do too much of it . Puts funny ideas into your head . You start daydreamin ' , you wo n't get your chores done . " <p> She bought me some new jeans and a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick socks . For herself , she stocked up on spices ; she was starting to run low , she even bought a bottle of vanilla . " Might try makin ' a cake or something . When was the last time you had cake ? " <p> " Had a birthday party once , when I was little . My ma bought a cake . " <p> " Store-bought cake ? Ai n't the same . You get your chores done , I 'll make you a cake so good you 'll think you died and went to heaven . " <p> Second time I heard about Doey was the next day at Meeting . <p> Meeting was a ways off , I could n't tell how far , but we were driving for at least an hour , maybe more , down a long corridor of dark , all twisty , up and down , with a couple of sharp turnoffs into passages that felt even darker . When we got there , we were n't really anywhere , just a wide open space with an old school-looking building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around was cut by seven different openings , but one of them was walled off with tall orange cones and Miz told me to stay well away from that one . I did n't ask why , she would n't have said anyway . <p> Inside , the room was gloomy , lit by kerosene lamps . No generator here . But it was warmer than outside and it was a chance to sit quiet-like and almost doze . It was kind of like church too , so you had to keep your eyes open . There were these old ladies up top all singin ' real faraway and soft like they was a choir of angels or something . The music was real old-fashioned , but it was n't too painful . <p> Then the mayor got up and talked about living the hard life and staying clean and trusting God and following the rules because the reason that things had gotten so bad was that so many people had stopped following the rules , and we 'd all made a big mess of things , so now we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tried to put things back together the best we could , but the only way to do that was to stay away from the dark and follow the rules . He went on and on like that for a long time . Then there was some discussion of chores that had to be done in the coming days , including putting down some new dark lines just to the west . He asked for volunteers for a work crew . <p> After Meeting , some folks climbed back into their trucks and drove off right away . But most folks gathered for tea and little sandwiches and even a cake . It looked real pretty . And everybody stood around in their clean clothes and talked polite and pretended everything was going fine , which it was n't , but nobody would say so , because nobody wanted to be accused of doing the devil 's talk . But you could see it in their faces , all hard and narrow and pinched . The sandwiches and cake disappeared fast . Some of these folks was hungry . Miz stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She whispered , " You let that food be , son . It 's not for us . It 's for them that has n't any . We have food at home . Some of these folks , this is their only meal today . " So I went outside and stood around by the cars with the other men , just stood and listened . <p> " Hey you , new boy ! " One of the men turned around and pointed to me . A big man . Beard . Overalls . A broken eye . <p> " Yeah ? " I answered the good eye . <p> " You coming out with us , tomorrow ? Help lay some dark lines ? " <p> I shrugged . " Du n no . Whatever Miz says . " <p> " Miz 'll say yes . If I ask her . Can I trust you to work ? Not stand around ? " <p> " I can work . " <p> " You have to promise to stay away from the bright . And keep your glasses on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we lost the other one . Whatsisname . Doey . You heard about that ? " He peered at me . <p> Did n't answer , just sorta shrugged again . Safest way . Better to have them think I 'm stupid than wrong . You can get killed being wrong . That 's a city lesson . But it might be true out here in the dark lands as well . <p> " He do n't know shit , " said someone else . " Just another dumb city boy . " <p> " He can carry . I 'll talk to Miz . We need the hands . Besides , if we lose him , nobody 'll care . Not even Miz . She 'll just hook another one off the train . " <p> And that was how it was decided that I should work on the dark team one or two days a week . I think Miz was glad to not have me around so much . There was n't enough work to keep me busy every day . Or maybe she was just glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little thin , even at her place . There just was n't enough light . Somebody said that made everybody sad all the time . Depressed , he said . And then someone else told him to shut up . That was the devil 's talk . Next he 'd be complaining about the dark lines and the lines were the only things keeping them out . And then somebody said , " Not in front of him , " meaning me , and that was the end of that conversation . <p> A few days later , an old truck pulled up in front of the house and a couple of workmen I did n't know got out and paid their respects to Miz . She handed them a paper bag with a bit of lunch in it , nowhere near enough to feed one hungry man , let alone three , but it was all she could spare . I climbed into the back of the pickup and made myself comfortable among the tools and wires . <p> We drove for half an hour , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then off to the right where the corridor ended in orange cones . The workmen got out then and we all put on heavy black goggles and breathing masks and shiny silver capes and heavy work gloves . Then we drove on . The driver steered the truck carefully around the cones and up the passage to where the dark lines simply stopped . Beyond the lines , the ground rolled away like a rumpled gray bedsheet . There were already two other trucks here and five other men . One of them had a map rolled out on the hood of his truck and he was drawing lines with a crayon . <p> When nobody was looking , I lifted my goggles just a bit and snuck a peek at the brightlands . Immediately , I wished I had n't . It knocked me backward . It was like being slapped in the face with a red-hot splash . I stumbled into the side of the truck , I fumbled the glasses back into place . My eyes were watering , I held them shut tight and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really stupid , then I heard the men laughing at me and I got angry . They could have warned me . But then , one of them , a big soft guy everybody called Tallow , came up and put a black cloth over my head . He reached under the hood , pushed my goggles back , and mopped my face with a damp rag . It smelled faintly of disinfectant . He said quietly , " Do n't take it bad . You only done what everybody else here did their first time too . We was all watching you . You got it over with quick . Now that you 've seen a little bit of what 's out there , you know what we all got to be careful about . Your eyes will stop hurting in a bit . " <p> " You looked too , your first time ? " <p> " Yep . Worse than you . I was n't much older than you neither . I went out with my cousins , they said it was n't nothing to be afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? So I did . That was real stupid . I stepped in it as deep as anyone could . It was most of an hour before I could see again . You got off easy , boy . " Then he leaned in close and whispered , " It was real pretty , was n't it ? After a while , you 're gon na start thinking that you 'd like to take another look . Do n't you be tempted , you hear ? Do n't you even think about it . " <p> " I wo n't , " I said . " I really truly wo n't . " And I meant it . My eyes were still hurting bad . But then , I asked , " What was all that ? What did I see ? " <p> " You never mind that . It was n't nothing . " <p> " It must have been something . It damn near knocked me down . " <p> " Do n't you get too curious , boy . It ai n't safe . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was , that 's all . So I 'll know . And then I wo n't ever ask again . Promise . " <p> Tallow sighed . " You ca n't ever talk about this to anyone , you hear ? You 're not supposed to know . Nobody is . They do n't want folks going out to see it for themselves . " He lowered his voice . " They call it colors . It 's what happens when light gets too bright . Your brain ca n't handle it . It 's called overload or something like that . It 's a little piece of madness , is what it is . You do n't want to get sucked into it . You wo n't never get back . You 'll just wander out there into the brights and die of your own hallucinations . That 's what happened to - never mind . " <p> " Doey ? " <p> " Yeah , that was his name . Damn fool was too smart for his own good . Do n't you go getting too smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much your face hurt . " <p> " I will . " <p> " You do that . Now that you know , you keep your gloomies on , you hear ? And that breathing mask too , so you ca n't smell anything either . The air is just as bad . And do n't say nothing to no one . No matter what . If you know what 's good for you . " <p> Tallow felt around under the hood , pulled my goggles back down over my eyes , and then made me check to see that they were properly seated . And the breathing mask too . When we were both satisfied , he pulled off the hood . I blinked and looked around . Everything was safely gray again . As long as I did n't think about what was really out there , I was okay . As long as I did n't say what I 'd seen , I was okay . I did n't even tell Tallow about the after-image still burning in my eyes . It looked like a naked boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomies back on , and I looked around everywhere . And I did n't tell him about the honey-smell either . Through the glasses , the brightlands looked flat and hard and empty . But I did n't have a lot of time for looking . There was too much work to do . <p> Putting down darklines was n't hard . Just tedious . Mostly , it was boring . <p> First , we pounded stakes . The stakes were heavy Y-shaped things anchored in an iron base . The base was pointed like a bee sting . It had to be pounded deep into the ground , three feet or more ; then the long leg of the Y part was stuck all the way into it . Then , after all the stakes were in place , we strung the wire , hanging it from one stake to the next . <p> I did n't do any of the actual stringing , that was done by the others . They had the strength for it , I did n't . I held cable , feeding it out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew manhandled it into position . They used pitchforks so they would n't have to touch the line themselves . It was a thick naked braid of wire . The outer threads were deliberately broken and frayed , so the line looked like it had silvery scraggly hair . The wire was supposed to be fuzzy , so the dark would be deeper and stiffer , so I had to wear thick gloves , because the frayed bits had sharp ends . Even with the work gloves , I still got a few pokes and jabs and had to pull a couple of wire splinters from the heel of my palm . <p> When it was lunch time , we all hiked up the corridor a ways , far enough so that none of the bright could get in , so we could finally take off our gloomies and air-masks . Even here , safe between the dark lines , it still felt too bright . Or maybe that was an after-effect . I did n't ask . There was n't much to eat , and what there was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese , wilted lettuce . Everything felt tired . Still , it was better than hunger . There was n't much talk among the work crew . Everybody seemed to have something personal to think about . I thought about the naked boy . Was he really there ? No , probly not . How could anyone stand naked in the bright ? We finished eating as quickly as we could and pulled our goggles and capes back on ; then hiked back out into the bright . <p> When the line was all strung , it was a chest-high fence . Not enough to stop anybody or anything . Least , not until it was turned on . The end of the line split into three separate wires that were fed into a terminator box . They put a terminator box at each end of the line , then they threw first one switch , then the other . <p> I pointed at the line . " How 's it work ? " <p> He waggled his hand . " It 's what 's called a seduction current . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a fancy way of saying it sucks the extra light out of the air . The more light it sucks , the thicker the dark it makes . " <p> " But nothing 's happening , " I said . The cable hung limp between the stakes . <p> Tallow grunted . " It takes a while . In a month , there 'll be another patch of land safe to grow on . It 'll go to the Martins . They might be able to get some winter wheat in . Might be enough to make it to spring . " <p> " Why does it take so long ? " <p> " It has to be slow . Otherwise , it would only make dark during the daytime , and we need the dark at night too . It usually takes a month or so for a line to suck enough light to get up to full strength , but after that , it only gets darker and stronger . Some of the older lines around here have enough residual in them to go for a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down . We 'll come back out next week and see if it caught . Sometimes the terminator boxes are bad . " He stepped over and peered closely at the wire . So did I , but I could n't see any difference . <p> " Can I ask you something ? " <p> " What ? " Tallow seemed annoyed , like he was getting tired of me . <p> " How does the line know how much light to suck ? What you said about the older lines getting stronger - do they ever suck too much light ? Could they make it too dark ? " <p> " Eh ? " Tallow squinted , suddenly angry . " Do n't you go anywhere with that . We got enough talk already . " <p> " I was just asking- " <p> " You was just asking too much . That 's not safe , boy . Do n't ask questions , just follow the rules , you hear ? " He strode away from me , began loading his tools into his truck . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here fast enough . Pretty soon , we all piled into our separate pickups and headed back down the corridor . They dropped me back at Miz 's place and that was that . <p> I worked on the line crews off and on all summer long , when I was n't mucking out stalls for Miz . Tallow did n't talk to me much , probly afraid he 'd already said too much . None of them ever talked to the city boy , so I mostly kept to myself . Every so often , I thought about the colors I 'd seen . I wondered if there was a safe way to look at them , a safe way to be naked ; but I did n't ask those questions . I did n't ask any questions at all anymore , and I did n't answer any either . I pounded stakes and unrolled wire . One day , I looked at myself in the mirror , I actually had muscles . But I was still hungry all the time . And cold . Miz managed to keep food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes we had cornbread . Sometimes just mush . We had eggs too , but the hens were n't laying regular . A couple of times we even had chicken . That was pretty good . We did n't starve , but nobody was getting fat either . <p> One Sunday , while we were at Meeting , one of the cows wandered into the dark ; either she did n't have enough sense to keep away or maybe she was daydreaming the way cows do and the dark just pulled her in . She was n't in her stall and she was n't in the field either . I finally found her , assend sticking out of the dark , and went running up the hill to the house . It took both me and Miz to drag the cow out , but she was never the same . She wobbled on her feet . She looked like she 'd been smacked in the face with a shovel . That night , she fell down in her stall . She would n't get up , so the vet came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , then took Miz off for a talk . <p> I did n't hear what they said , but Miz looked angry and frustrated . Finally she nodded her head . The vet came back into the barn and put the cow down . Put a gun to her head and thump , just like a street-killing , execution style . It took all three of us to jack the cow up with a block and tackle . We hung her by the hind legs and cut some veins to drain the blood . The vet opened up her belly and the organs spilled out onto a canvas tarp . Some of it , Miz fed to the hogs , the heart and brains and tongue , she put into a big tub for pickling . I got the feeling she 'd done this before , especially the way she stripped off the hide and stretched it out for tanning . We left the cow hanging so the meat could age two-three days , you ca n't eat it right away , it 's too tough ; hanging makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back early with a couple of helpers , and we all started hacking and sawing . We were a week smoking the meat . We pickled some of it too , in great big jars . We did n't eat much of it ourselves though . It did n't taste very good . Like it was old and stale . Even when you put gravy on it . Miz said that was the effect of the dark . <p> Finally , on Friday , we wrapped and boxed everything we could . On Saturday , Miz and me packed as much as we could fit into the truck and she drove into town , where she traded that cow for hard goods , spices , and even some jars of fruit from somewhere up north . Some people would eat it , she said . Just not us . <p> Miz did n't take me with that day , she wanted me to stay behind , in case anybody came wandering by . Word was that some brightlanders had wandered through town recently and nobody was sure if they 'd moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd heard about them at Meeting . They all wore long black capes , just dark enough to keep them from going mad , except maybe they were a little mad from all that time in the bright . And maybe they 'd come through looking to see if there was anything worth stealing . Maybe they were out there now , just waiting on the other side of the dark . But I did n't think it was the brightlanders Miz was fearing . I think it was our own neighbors . Some of them were real hungry , even eating tree bark . Miz had a big pot of stew simmering on the stove for Sunday 's Meeting . Maybe some of them folks would n't wait . So I stayed behind , sitting on the front porch , watching the chickens scratching through the remaining patches of grass . <p> Moments like this , I watched the dark . Sometimes , if you watched it close enough , you could see it move . It looked like it was flowing real slow , like a river of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes it was dark gray ; that was mostly at night . The dark leaked . It could n't hold all the light it sucked and some of it seeped back out . Just enough to make everything look like moonlight . <p> But the closer you got to the dark , the worse you felt , like it was n't just sucking light , but life as well . Everything close to the dark looked bad , all dusty-dull and shabby , turning gray and old in the gloom . I tried to stay away from it , especially now that I knew how it worked . But there was something about it , something I could n't explain . I always felt like it was pulling me into it . Miz called it dark-sniffing . I had to watch myself . I wondered if someday I 'd get so lost in some dream that I 'd wander right into it , not even realizing what I was doing . That 's what happened to the cow . <p> That 's when the colored boy appeared . <p> First I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . I stood up , looking around , wondering where the flowers were . Then I saw him . <p> He stepped out of the dark at the bottom of the hill and started up the path to the house like he lived here . I saw him instantly . He stood out like a flash of the brightlands . Where everything else was gray , he was all the different colors a person could be . He glowed like he was lit from within . He was gold all over . His hair flashed in shades of red and blond ; his skin shimmered like sunset . He was shining and naked . I 'd never seen anybody so beautiful . He could have come from the far side of the sky . Wherever he 'd come from , I wanted to go there . I wanted to glow too . <p> He came all the way up to the porch . He put one foot on the bottom step , then stopped . I knew who he was . " You Doey ? " <p> He nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to dance . I was real tempted to take it , he was so beautiful . But I did n't . After a moment , he lowered his hand . <p> " Was that you I saw in the bright ? " <p> He smiled , a dazzle of happiness . I 'd never seen anything like that . It just made me hurt with longing all the more . He was insane , of course . He had to be . How could he not ? <p> " Do you talk ? " I asked . <p> He laughed . A gentle chuckle of sound , like a shared secret . " Yes , I talk . I also sing . I dance . I laugh . Do you ? " <p> Shrug . " I du n no . Never tried . Never had much reason to try . " <p> He stepped up one step . He reached out with his hand . I took a step back . He drew his hand back , then took another step up , this time onto the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't move away . With outstretched fingers , he touched my shirt , my chest . Through the faded cotton , I felt a hot rush of feeling I could n't explain . His eyes met mine . His eyes were green and blue and violet . Not the sad shabby colors of the faded flowers around the edges of the old gray house , but the glistening sparkle of the deep edge of the rainbow . His eyes were bright . Everything about him was bright . The touch of his fingers - it felt like he was pumping energy into me . I felt alivened . Was this the magic of the bright ? Was this how people went crazy ? I did n't want the moment to end . I wanted to fall helplessly into it , dissolving into a bath of color , just like Doey . <p> I reached up with my own hand , took his in mine , held it , felt the warmth , both strong and soft at the same time , released it , reached across and touched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat against his hot and glowing body . There was nothing I needed to say , there was everything I wanted to say . There was perfect understanding and a thousand thousand questions . I 'd never known a moment like this . Never felt a hot surge of feeling like this . I thought I was going to faint . Or fly apart in pieces . <p> " Yes , " he said , finally . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Yes , you know how to sing and dance and laugh . You just have n't had a place to do it . " <p> My mouth was dry as dust . " Will you - can you take me there ? " <p> He smiled and leaned forward . Close enough to kiss . " When you learn to glow . " <p> " How do I - ? " <p> He touched my lips with a golden finger , silencing my question . <p> " Hush , " he whispered . " Not yet . Not yet . " <p> And then he whirled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leapt and danced and flew , arms outstretched , all the way down the hill and back into the wall of darkness that surrounded the house . And then he was gone . Leaving only the fading scent of color . The afternoon was dull and gray again . I felt tears on my cheeks . Both joy and despair at the same time . <p> I almost ran after him , almost . Something held me back . All the words , all the warnings , all the gloom that wrapped the world . He was right . I was n't ready to let go . Not yet . Not yet . Oh , that bastard boy of color . How did he do that ? How could he flirt and fly ? How did he live ? Where had he gone ? <p> Sank down into a chair , an old wooden chair that creaked in pain as it accepted my weight . A faded cushion , hard and flat as cardboard . What mad thing had just happened here ? Damn that Doey ! I hated him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was , and I wanted to be him more than anything . <p> I was comfortable here . Working for Miz . Working on the lines . I was comfortable , wrapped in dark . I did n't have to care . I did n't have to think . I only had to follow the rules . I could do that . Okay , I was n't happy , but I was n't unhappy either . I was comfortable and after being hungry and tired and cold and uncomfortable for so long , comfortable was a good place to be . It was enough . I did n't need happy . Happy did n't exist anyway . Certainly not here . And then the glowing boy stepped out of the dark and looked in my eyes and touched my heart and left me gasping with desperation . Because now that I knew what happy was , now that I knew it did exist , how could I ever be comfortable again anywhere ? <p> Now that I knew what happy felt like , I also knew I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like . <p> Did he know how cruel his words were ? " Not yet . Not yet . " <p> I felt so torn up inside I did n't know what I felt . I put my head into my hands and started sobbing , I do n't know why . Cried for Ma , cried for me . Cried for the whole stupid everything . Who made up this stupid world anyway ? Why did we have to put down all these walls of darkness ? What was on the other side that everybody was so afraid of they would n't even talk about it ? And why did I feel so awful ? <p> After a while , I felt all hollow and empty . So I got up and went to the barn . Stood around for a bit , then finally started mucking out stalls . Not because I wanted to , but it was something to do . And if I did n't do it , Miz would have words , lots of words . I hated all her words . I just never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she sniffed the air and looked at me sharply . " What happened here ? " she asked . <p> " Nothing , " I said . <p> " Do n't lie to me , Michael . Something happened here . I can see it in your face . You 're all hot and flushed . Your cheeks are red . " She put a hand on my forehead . " You 're burning up . You have a fever . " <p> " It 's nothing , " I said . Maybe too loud . <p> She grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the horse trough . " Take off your shirt , " she demanded . I did so and she pushed me down to my knees , pushed me head first into the sour brown water . She picked up a horse brush and began scrubbing my back with it . I could n't scream and I could n't breathe and I was trying to do both at the same time . She yanked me up , gasping . Before I could stop myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me promise never to say again . She did n't even hesitate , she just whacked me across the head with the heavy wooden brush , knocking me backward . <p> " You 're still an evil old bitch ! And beating me to death ai n't gon na change that . " <p> " You think I 'm stupid ? " Miz shouted . She was loud . " You think I do n't see what you 're turning into ? You want to go out there and get colored ? You want to glow ? You want to turn into some kind of fairy dancer ? You want to die in delirium ? Why do you think we put up all the darklines ? Because we like the dark ? You think we like being cold and hungry and miserable all the time ? No , we do it because we do n't have any choice . We have to protect ourselves . All of us . Even you - you stupid city boy . " <p> I did n't say what I was thinking . She made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was all confused . If the dark was so good , why did it feel so bad . And if the bright was so bad , why did it feel so good ? I pulled myself bitterly back to my feet . Already , I was trying to figure out how I could get away from here . I could probly get a loaf of bread out of the kitchen , maybe some vegetables , put them in an old potato sack or something . But where could I go ? And how could I get there ? Walk the roads ? Maybe , but to where ? And if anybody else came down the road , they 'd see me for sure . No place to hide in the corridors . Follow the train tracks ? Maybe . But where did they go ? Just to another place like this . I did n't know . I needed a map or something . But there had to be someplace somewhere better than this . I shook the water out of my hair , brushed it back with my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me against the trough . My back hurt from the scrubbing of the brush . And my head was throbbing like a nightmare . I hurt all over . And I stank of the foul water . And I was cold . Evening was coming on , and the dark was expanding . <p> Out in the barn , wrapped in a blanket , shivering against the night , listening to the wind scrabbling against the old wood , all the voices argued back and forth . Evil old bitch . I do n't care what she thinks . This is sick . Everything is sick . These people are dying . I do n't want to die with them . They 're all sick and dirty and dead inside . I do n't want to be like this . But there 's no way out . It 's a trap . All the darklines , all the rules , all the walls everywhere . <p> And just what 's out there on the other side of the lines anyway ? What 's so horrible that you ca n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Doey was n't wearing any gloomies . He was naked like one of those angels in the old books . He was as beautiful as a girl with long flowing red hair , but he was stallion-cut like a prize . He was both at once . I 'd never seen anyone or anything like that . How did he live out there ? How did he see without being blinded ? What did he say ? Learn to dance . No . Learn to glow . How do you glow ? How do you learn ? All those questions , and nobody to ask . Nobody to trust . <p> Next morning was Meeting . I was n't going to go , but Miz did n't take no arguments . She just told me to clean myself up , put on a clean shirt , and not go around smelling like a pig . But once we were in the truck , she did say one thing . She said , " I did n't want to hurt you yesterday , Michael . What I did , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were all glassy . I had to dunk you in the water and scrub your back hard and smack you to put you in all that pain to pull you back from wherever it was you were drifting off to . I 've seen that look before , saw it on Doey . Did n't act fast enough with him . He danced away one night . Ai n't going to lose you too . I see you starting to glow , I 'm going to beat you - not because I want to hurt you , but because hurting you is the only way to pull you out . You understand that , do n't you ? " <p> " Yes 'm . Whatever . " <p> We pulled up at Meeting early , but we was n't the first ones there . Bunch of folks all clustered by their trucks , talking . They looked over as we drove up , and a couple of them walked over to talk to Miz . She glanced at me , then moved off a ways so I could n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care anyway and wandered down to where the older kids were scratching in the dirt with sticks . J.D. was there , the kid with the broken tooth , the kid from town who 'd first told me about Doey . Nobody had names out here , only initials . He stopped what he was doing , tossed his stick aside , and said , " You hear ? " <p> " Hear what ? " <p> " ' Bout the Trasks ? " <p> " What about them ? " <p> " They went out . " <p> " Out where ? " <p> " You stupid , city boy ? Out . " <p> " Oh . Out . " <p> " Doc drove over to see if they was all right , if they had enough food . He had a couple spare bags of beans and rice . He got there , they was all gone . The whole family . Ever single one . Even the baby . And one of their fields was starting to glow . Big hole in the darklines - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have no gloomies . He got out of there fast . Scared-like . That 's what I heard , anyway . They 're going to send out a hunting party , I bet . Go shoot some bright-eyes . They 're going to need every gun in town . You know how to shoot , city boy ? " <p> " I can shoot , " I said . <p> " Then you 'll get to go , for sure . They wo n't let me go . I already asked . They said I was too small . That 's a damn lie . They just ai n't forgiven my pa for losin ' a gun last hunt . They say he stole it . But he di n't . The brighties did . Turned it into something weird , I bet . " <p> " How would you know ? " <p> " I know lotsa stuff . More than you . " <p> " Yeah ? You think so ? " <p> " I know so . " <p> " Yeah ? How do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . " Not gon na say what I know . " <p> I wanted to tell him about the bright-eyed boy . I wanted to ask him if he 'd ever seen the naked colors . But something told me that probly was n't a good idea . So I just shrugged . Whatever . Drop it . Turned away , back to the others . More folks was arriving now . I hiked up the hill to where Tallow was standing , waited behind him for a bit until no one else was talking . He finally noticed me . " You want something ? " <p> " You going hunting ? " <p> " You got a gun ? " <p> " Miz does , I think . " <p> He scratched his neck thoughtfully . " Probly not a good idea . You being a city boy . And we 're going out deep . Miz wo n't like that . But maybe you can hold the wire at the safe end . Might could use you that way . You just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just makes a bad idea seem worse . " <p> Then Miz came over with Doc . He looked at me , took my chin in his hand , turned my head side to side . Looked into my eyes . Put a hand on my forehead . Asked me to stand on one foot , put my arms out , and shut my eyes tight . Stuff like that . Turned to Miz . " He looks all right to me . You probly got to him in time . But if you want me to wrap him in darkline for a bit , suck some of the brightness out of him , bring him by one day , and we 'll give him a bit of treatment . " <p> " I 'll do that , thanks , " she said . " You be in tomorrow ? " <p> " Better Avait till the end of the week , " he said . " It 's going to be a busy few days . Let 's get this Trask business taken care of first . I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually , we all got inside and got settled , but nobody was thinking about Meeting . Everybody was still whispering . It was like the room was full of bluebottle flies . The mayor said that he was sorry about the bad news , everybody had probly heard it anyway , but he had to officially confirm it . The darklines had broken by the Trask farm and it looked as if the Trasks had been enchanted . And yes , there would be a committee meeting to decide what to do next . Volunteers should make themselves known to the usual folks . <p> After that , there was n't much else to say , because nobody was listening anyway , so we broke up early . Folks did n't eat much , they was mostly too upset . The whole family was gone , even the baby . Not even bodies left for a proper funeral . Lots of talk floated around . Somebody was going to have to get out there and take care of the livestock . Miz said she could take the cows and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want no more pigs right now . They ate too much . A couple of the other folks spoke up , laying claim to tools or dishes or furniture . Blankets and quilts . Pots and pans . A little of this and some of that . Eventually , it was all sorted out , who was going to go out and pick stuff up . Tallow opened his truck and passed out gloomies to the folks who were going to need them . <p> Miz collected goggles and masks for us and some capes too , shiny on one side , black on the other . And gloves , just in case . We did n't even head home , just straight out through town and off around the hill to the Trask place . I do n't know how Miz knew the way . All the corridors looked the same to me , just narrow twisty roads through the dark . But I tried to pay attention anyway , just in case . Miz kept talking , the whole trip . She was angry about everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , way out on the borders with nothing between them and the bright . Damn fool stupid idea from the start . And now a whole family is lost . And the farm . And it 's not like we have families or farms to spare . Lord knows what shape the poor animals are in . Put your goggles and mask on , boy . We 're almost there . And you put that cape and gloves on before you get out of the car , you hear ? " <p> She pulled up short of the farm and pulled on her own cape and goggles and gloves and breathing mask . She pushed the goggles up on her forehead and inched the truck forward , a little bit at a time . I pushed my gloomies up just enough to see under the frames . We came around the last curve and there was the brightness leaking in around the edges of the broken dark . We both pulled our goggles down at the same time . " I told you to keep those things on . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> We pulled up in front of the barn . It was old and saggy . It leaned to one side and it looked like it was ready to collapse , even worse than Miz 's barn . Miz looked off toward the bright before getting out of the truck . Half the darkline was down , the dark just faded off into filigree wisps . Beyond , the fields glowed harsh and stark in our gloomies . Without the goggles , they would have been impossible to look at . <p> Miz made a clucking sound of disapproval . I followed her into the barn . There were three cows tethered , all of them lowing uncomfortably . Miz told me to load up the sacks of feed , while she set about milking the cows . Afterward , I loaded the cans into the truck . Then she blindfolded the cows and led them out of the barn , tying their tethers to the back of the truck . Then she went and found a stack of empty crates and we began collecting the chickens . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crated ; but others were lying stunned on the ground outside . A few were wandering around dazed . Those she picked up and swiftly broke their necks . <p> " Ca n't they be saved ? " I asked . <p> Miz shook her head . " Too dangerous . Too much bright in ' em . This is better . Safer . " There were a few little chicks too , all safe in the incubator . She put these in a crate , dropped a canvas over it , and I loaded the crate into the back of the pickup . We walked around the barn then , looking to see what else we could find . The two pigs in the back were both gone . Miz shook her head at that . " Probly ran into the bright . Pigs are like that , " she said . <p> Then we saw it . The fourth cow . It was staggering , all glassy-eyed and confused . It looked bright - not as bright as the brightland , but brighter than it should be . Miz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went to the truck and pulled out her shotgun from the back window . <p> " Do n't you want to walk it into the barn ? " <p> " What for ? " <p> " That 's a lot of meat - " <p> " Nobody 's going to eat this beef . It 's sick . You want to get sick too ? " <p> " Ca n't you have Doc wrap it in darkline and drain the bright out of it ? " <p> " You ca n't drain it . Draining takes the flavor out . And you ca n't let people eat meat that 's been brightened either . That 's even worse . No , this covf is gone . " She lifted the shotgun , moved closer , then moved closer again , until the barrel was almost touching the cow 's skull . I did n't want to see it , but I could n't look away either . The rifle flashed . The cow dropped to the ground with a thud . She stepped closer and fired the second barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house then . She would n't let me go in , but she came out carrying a pillow case full of spices and other things from the kitchen . Even a small jar of honey , I found out later . That was a surprise . The Trasks were n't supposed to be doing that well . <p> Back in the truck , barely inching along the road , not moving faster than the three tethered cows could follow , Miz started talking again . She looked old . Older than the first day . And tired too . Like she 'd been drained a few times . " This is n't right , " she said . " Letting cows and pigs and chickens and com go bad like that . And all those vegetables . Nobody should have been out this far , with only one line of dark between them and that - that brightmare . Now look what it 's gone and done . A family gone , a cow gone . Two pigs running loose in the bright . All those chickens . All that food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It took most of the day to bring the cows in . It was a long drive and we could n't go very fast . But we were back before dusk settled in . I was glad of that . I did n't like being out in the dark . Not any kind of dark at all . <p> I slept badly . Tossed and turned in the straw all night . Finally , just before dawn , I got up and walked out of the barn . I tried to look up at the stars . Once in a while , you can still see them , some of them , but not tonight . Everything was black . Just dim shapes of black against blacker . I thought about lighting a lantern , but I did n't want to wake Miz , so I just stood barefoot and listened . Nothing much to hear . Just wind . A lonely cricket . Not a lot of insects anymore . I heard that one in town . That was the real reason everything was dying . The insects could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants , no bugs , no spiders , nothing . <p> Not even a glimmer of bright from over the hill . Sometimes you can see it , mostly its reflection off the clouds . But not tonight . <p> Finally , I went back into the barn , back to my straw . Pulled my blanket around me and just sat with my arms wrapped around my knees , rocking softly . I used to do that when I was little . I do n't remember much from when I was little , we moved around so much . But I remember I spent a lot of time sitting in the dark and rocking . Sometimes Mom would come and sit with me , wrapping her arms around me , and we 'd sit as quiet as we could , not making any noises , so they would n't find us . <p> Thought about what I 'd seen . Everything . All the bright leaking over into the fields . Miz did n't know , but while she was milking the cows , I 'd lifted up the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bright directly , but at the fields it was just creeping into . That did n't hurt so much . I could see the colors , all the dazzling colors , everything at once - the rustling golden corn in the field , the crisp green stalks so clear it was like they cut the air , the rich dark soil like a warm bed , even the sky above glowed blue . I 'd never even known such colors were possible . I wanted to see more . But then , I heard a noise behind me and just as quick-like I pushed the goggles back down over my eyes . I did n't want to get caught . Not by Miz . Because Miz wanted to take me to Doc . And wrap me in darkline . And drain the bright out of me . Like the beef . Drained beef . " You ever taste drained beef ? You wo n't like it . " Maybe that 's what 's wrong with these people . They 've all been drained . <p> But what if Miz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept looking until it was too late , until I was sucked away into the brightland too ? I wondered what that might feel like - to dance naked in the stars . To whirl and dazzle and laugh . Madness , yes . But even madness looked better than this life . Miz wanted to wrap me in dark and make me just like everybody else . My stomach rumbled and I wondered what people ate in the brightlands . Magic corn ? Enchanted beans ? I did n't know . Nobody knew . Anybody who knew had n't come back to tell . Maybe they was all dead , lying bright and starved ? Maybe the bright pigs was eating them . Maybe this and maybe that and maybe some of the other . Nobody knew . Or if they did , they was n't saying . <p> Finally , I just rolled over , curled up and tried to sleep . Thinking about stuff does n't do any good . It does n't work . It just makes my head hurt . Enough . Enough already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to sleep . <p> For the next couple days , Miz did n't say anything more about getting me darklined , but I knew she was still set on the idea . She kept giving me these looks . But maybe she also felt bad about having to do it , because she made some honey-cornbread and cut me an extra thick slab with lots of butter . Or maybe she just felt I had to have my strength up so I could survive being drained . She did n't say . And I did n't ask . I was starting to think about running again . We still had the gloomies and the capes in the truck . Maybe if I could find my way to the Trask farm , I could go outside the darklines and cross the bright to some other place . Supposedly , the town council had some maps somewhere , but nobody was allowed to see them . <p> Tuesday evening , Tallow came driving up unexpectedly . He talked with Miz a bit , then told me to get into the truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkline at the Trask farm . And maybe do a bit of hunting too . Miz sniffed unhappily . I could see she disapproved . She did n't trust any of this . She came right out and said it . " That boy 's got too much bright in him . He ai n't been drained . If you do n't tie him down good , you know he 'll just get sucked into the colors . I swear , you lose him and I 'll skin you bad , Tallow , I will . " <p> " Nah , you 'll just get another one off the next train . Like you always do . " Tallow grinned back . <p> Miz did n't think that was funny . She sniffed again in that funny way she had . " Oh , hell . Wait a minute . " She went to her own truck and pulled the rifle down out of the back window , and the box of shells next to it . She cracked it open and popped the two shells out , dropping them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to open my door . She handed me the shotgun and the box of shells . " Do n't you load this thing unless you need it . And you bring it back clean , y'hear ? Tallow , you teach him how to use it . It 's on your head now . " <p> Tallow grunted and climbed into the truck . He pulled his door shut and put the engine into gear . We rolled down the hill and into the corridor of twisted dark . Tallow laughed . " Miz is good folks , but some folks say she 's been drained one too many times . " <p> I thought about that . It kind of made sense . " You ever been drained ? " I asked . <p> " Most folks around here have . For their own good . " <p> " Oh , " I said . <p> " It does n't really hurt . It just makes you queasy , a little . Like having the runs , sort of . After a couple days , the feeling goes away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . " <p> " Did the bright ever get to you ? I mean , before you were drained ? " <p> Tallow 's face tightened . " Y'know , boy . This ai n't really anything you want to talk about . You do n't want to go asking too many questions . Folks 'll start talkin ' . " <p> " Just curious , that 's all . " <p> " Yep , that 's all . That 's what they all said . Just curious . You do n't want to get too curious about the bright . You want to stay away from it . That 's why we smacked you with it the first day on the lines - so 's you 'll know . You 've seen all you need to see . Right ? " When I did n't answer , he repeated himself . " Right ? " <p> I shrugged . " Whatever . " <p> Tallow stopped the truck with a screech . I jerked forward with the suddenness of the stop . He turned to me and grabbed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know what you 're dealing with here . That ai n't a question . It 's the truth . You do n't know shit . So when I tell you how it is , I 'm not just running my mouth ' cause I like hearing my jaw flap . I 'm telling you what you need to know so you do n't get sucked away like all the others . We used to be three times as many people and ten times as much livestock and crops . Where do you think all those folks went ? All those animals ? They did n't listen and they did n't take care and now they 're gone . You want to be gone too ? just keep asking questions . You ask too many questions , we 'll open the dark and toss you out in the bright ourselves . This is for your own good , city boy . If you want to live , you better learn to listen . " <p> " I thought you liked me , " I said . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't about liking . Even if I did n't like you , I would n't want to see you turn into one of them damn fairy dancers . " <p> " You 've seen them ? " <p> Tallow did n't answer . He let go of my shoulder and turned away and put the truck back into gear . I rubbed where he 'd grabbed me so hard . <p> " You did n't answer my question . " <p> " That 's right . I did n't . " Tallow did n't say anything else for the rest of the drive . That left me with lots of time to think about all the things he was n't saying . I got the feeling he knew more than it was safe for anyone to know . And maybe he did n't want anyone else to know how much he knew . But it was only a feeling and he 'd made it real clear that he was n't going to answer any more questions of any kind . I felt bad about that . Because maybe if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him I 'd seen one too . And maybe then we 'd each have someone we could trust enough to talk about it . Except I did n't dare tell him , because he might tell someone else ; and he could n't risk saying anything to me either , because I was just another stupid city boy . <p> " We going out tonight ? " <p> " Tomorrow . Early morning . But I do n't have time to drive out and pick you up then , so you 'll sleep behind the feed store tonight with some of the other boys . You keep your hands to yourself , you keep your mouth shut , and you do n't ask any questions . I 'll keep Miz 's shotgun in my truck . No sense in having you shoot yourself in the foot , or anybody else either . " <p> Behind the feedstore , it was just a big empty space under a sagging roof . A few bags of feed , here and there , just enough to make a rough bed . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four or five others talking together , nothing important . I recognized two of them , but J.D. was the only one whose name I knew . They glanced at me , but did n't say anything . Just another city boy , using up space , eating up food . I grabbed a stretch of canvas to use as a blanket and made myself comfortable off in a corner , away from the others . They had a kerosene lamp , but that was all . The light pretended to warmth , but the night was just as cold here as anywhere else . <p> After a while , J.D. wandered over , wrapped in a blanket . " Hey , city boy . Can I sleep by you ? " <p> Shrugged . Not yes , not no . J.D. pushed a couple of feed bags into position and stretched out on top of them . " You know something you 're not saying . " It was n't a question . <p> I did n't answer . <p> " If you tell me what you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rolled over on my side , turned away from him . I trusted him less than anybody . J.D. liked to talk , liked to pretend he knew stuff . Safest not to tell him anything . <p> " Aw , c'm on - " <p> " Fine . Okay . You go first . " <p> " No , you , " he insisted . <p> " Forget it then . " I settled myself again . <p> Silence for a bit . Just enough time for me to figure out what was going on . They 'd sent J.D. over to find out what I knew , if I 'd ever seen anything . <p> A minute more and I figured out the rest of it . It did n't matter what I said . J.D. was going to make something up for me . <p> " Okay , " he said . " I 'll tell you . Folks keep seein ' Doey . Miz 's other boy . He 's a fairy dancer now . We 're goin ' out to find him . Hunt him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maw says - " <p> I sat up and looked at him . " J.D. Go away . Get away from me . You got devil-talk inside you and I do n't want to hear it . Get away from me or I 'll punch you . " I said it loud enough for the others to hear . That was enough . J.D. gathered up his blanket and went scuttling back to the others . <p> He had n't told me anything I did n't know already . It was n't that hard to figure out . Even the rest of it , the part he had n't said . Not just Doey , but the Trask family too , if they were still alive . Anyone and anything in the brightlands . Did n't need to be smart to figure that out . Just scared and angry and tightened up inside . <p> But something about this did n't feel right . Going out and shooting people . Even if they were all colored . No matter how little you felt inside . Just fix the darklines , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . But going out into the bright . That did n't sound like a good idea . Not for this reason , not for any reason . Not unless you were planning to never come back . I just wish I knew more about what was out there . But if anybody around here knew , they were n't saying , and it sure was n't safe to ask . <p> Next thing I knew , Tallow was kicking me awake . " Time to go , city boy . Move your ass . " I rolled off the sack of feed onto the hard black dirt . It looked as dark in here as it was out there , but Tallow was waving a lantern , and that outlined everything in brown gloom . Two other men were kicking the rest of the boys awake . I did n't see J.D. anywhere . <p> I pulled myself to my feet , scratching and aching and hurting all over . My stomach hurt the worst . " Is there anything to eat ? " Nobody answered . <p> I followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or seven trucks had pulled up . Somebody had set up a table with a big plate of hard biscuits and even some hot coffee , seven or eight men just lining up . I fell in line behind them , then got pushed even further back when three more arrived . " Wait your turn , city boy . Let the men eat first . " Pigs . <p> Bitter coffee and a couple of biscuits later , they formed up teams . I recognized most of the men from the darkline team , plus a few folks from Meeting . And a couple of the big stocky women too . Some of them had guns . This was n't any darkline crew . <p> After a bit of discussion , people figuring out who was going to ride with who , that kind of stuff , Tallow pointed me toward one of the trucks , and I climbed into the back with two other boys . I said hello , but they ignored me . After a few last-minute instructions , the trucks all headed out toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an ominous line snaking through the dark . <p> We could n't drive very fast , it was n't safe , so by the time we arrived , the sky was just starting to show an edge of gray - or maybe it was the glow off the distant brightness . I could n't be sure , and I was n't going to ask . We stopped down the hill from the Trask place and safely behind the bend in the road , so no one would accidentally get a glimpse of brightness before they got their goggles on . <p> We bumbled around in the gloom for a while , while the Sheriff and a couple of others organized everybody into teams . I was pushed over to stand with Tallow . He was carrying Miz 's gun as well as his own , but he made no move to give it to me . I was n't sure why I was even here , nobody was talking to me . <p> Finally , everything was sorted out and we all put on our shiny capes and our gloomies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trudged up the last of the road , around the bend of the corridor of dark , and finally up the hill to where the ground was starting to glow . And beyond that , we could see where the glare was leaking into the air from the brightlands . Kind of like the dazzle of light from an open refrigerator in a midnight kitchen . <p> Two of the men rolled a cart with three huge spools of darkwire on it . For some reason , everybody kept close to the cart . Even though the wire was n't powered , folks still acted like they were safer staying close to it . Once we got to the top of the hill , I looked around for the dead cow , but where I thought it should be , I saw only a hump , covered with little white flowers . We all waited while the Sheriff and his deputies looked out across the brightland through special binoculars . They whispered to themselves for a bit , pointing and nodded and finally agreeing . After some more conferences , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a convenient post ; they hooked up a terminator box to it , there was another terminator connected to the end of the wire inside the big drum . <p> Then , when that was done , we all headed out into the bright , with the cart leading and the men unspooling the wire as they went . We did n't install any posts , we were n't putting up a darkline . This was only a safety line . All you had to do was follow it back . You could do it with your eyes closed , if you had to . I hoped I would n't have to . Just the little bit of leakage around the edge of my goggles was painful . <p> Nobody told me where we were headed , so I just followed Tallow . At least , I thought it was Tallow . In the harsh glare , with all of us caped and goggled , everybody looked alike , all different shades of gray and white and whiter . To keep from stumbling , I spent most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the footsteps of the man I thought was Tallow . We hiked into the brightness where the ground turned white like salt - that 's what it looked like through the gloomies ; it must have been glittering gold without them . <p> We hiked through scorched fields , abandoned to the bright . An old dirt road cut straight through , but it was already starting to get overgrown . On either side , twisted trees groped in the glare . They looked like they were alive , their limbs slowly moving , waving , even reaching . We kept clear of them . And the bushes too - they looked like they were all burning . They were so bright , even the gloomies could n't keep out all the color . They looked burnished with a hint of red and gold , like they were all wrapped in shivering flame . Everywhere else , I saw stalks of something that might have been corn once , but was something else now ; they looked like torches . <p> None of this made much sense to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ? Ten feet away , everything blurred out in yellow and white . It was like fog on fire . And nobody was saying much either . If they knew what they were doing , they were n't telling . <p> Finally , someone in front of me stopped and pointed . A couple of others stopped , so I did too . At first , I could n't see what they were looking at , but finally I made it out , way out there , way beyond the place where the road just dazzled out , there was a tall old house , an outline of a house , a glimmering hint of a house . I guessed that was where we were heading , I tried to make it out clearer-but then somebody punched me in the back and growled , " Keep moving , bait . " So I pushed on . <p> It was hot out here . Once , I tried looking off to the east , tried to see the Sun , the source of all this brightness , but the gloomies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I had to walk blind for a few moments until they reset themselves . <p> Eventually , we reached the house . It was in a field of grass so bright that the goggles showed it black , they did n't even try to resolve it . The house itself looked like it was made out of glass . The walls had gone glistening and transparent , and all we could see clearly was just the structural outlines , the edges and corners . It looked like it had been here forever , standing tall and stately , with porches and gables and even a widow 's walk around the front and sides . And a tall cupola . It was almost a castle . Even Miz 's house was n't this big . <p> The two men with the cart cut the wire and tied one end of it to one of the porch posts . Once they did that everybody felt safer . A few folks started to go up onto the porch , but Sheriff stopped them , said the house was off-limits to everybody . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into three teams . Each team had a cart and a roll of wire . Each team tied one end of their wire to the porch , connected a terminator , then headed out a bit and waited . One team was pointed straight out south , the other two east and west . <p> Tallow was on the western team , but when I went to follow , he grabbed me by the arm and walked me back to the house . " No , your job is to wait here and make sure nothing happens to the wires . " <p> " By myself ? " <p> " Nothing 's going to happen . You 're perfectly safe . You have four active darkwires terminating here . " <p> " Then why do you need me to stay here ? I thought I was going with you . " <p> " I promised Miz . " <p> " Then give me the gun . " <p> " You wo n't need it . " <p> " Then why 'd she give it ? " <p> " Stop asking so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll be able to see farther . " <p> " Ca n't see anything in this bright . Neither can you . And why 'd he call me ' bait ? ' I 'm the lure , are n't I ? " <p> Tallow grabbed my shoulder . Hard . Just like last time . " Listen to me , city boy . If we take you out there , you 'll get sucked away so fast you wo n't have time to scream for help . You stay here because I say you stay here . And if you want to argue about it , we can tie you down with darkline . And that wo n't be just an hour of draining , it could be a day or two or forever . You want that ? " <p> I did n't answer . Not right away . " You say nothing will happen ? " <p> " Nothing will happen . " <p> " You sure ? " <p> " Get up on the porch . Oh , wait - " He fumbled under his cape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscuits and a bottle of water . In case you get hungry . " <p> " How long are you going to be out there ? " <p> " As long as it takes . " And then , he added . " Probly back by afternoon , certainly before nightfall . We do n't want to spend the night out here , that 's for sure ; this place glows in the dark . You just stay awake and make sure those wires stay tied . " He started to turn away , then turned back . " You 'll be all right . " <p> And then he was gone . All of them were gone . They hiked out into the bright and faded away in the distance like wavering shadows . <p> Tallow said I could go up on the porch , but I was n't sure it was safe . The Sheriff had n't let anybody else go up there . But maybe that was just because he did n't want anything disturbed . What the hell . I put one foot on the glassy first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . It held too . One more step and I was on the porch . It felt yellow everywhere . Dusty yellow . And it smelled of sweet sharp lemons . Even through the mask . And honey . And honeysuckle . And green melons . It was wonderfully delicious . Could the men out in the fields smell it too ? What kept them from ripping off their masks and rolling around in the delicious air ? <p> And the sounds - now that I was n't surrounded by hulking men with their three-day sweaty stinks , the underfoot crunching of dirty boots , the lumbering hooves of upright beasts , the clatter of machinery and the stink of gun oil - now that all of that was gone , I could hear the tinkling music of translucent leaves , rustling in the delicate touch of the breeze . The wind sang like a distant chorus , very faint and far away . Silvery insects rattled and buzzed . And now , much nearer , something soft and small kept calling , " Hoo-hooo , hoo-hoooo . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - bird or cricket or owl , I did n't know , but it sounded like the voice at the edge of the world , but so close by now that I wanted to find it , wanted to peer over the edge and see what was there on the other side . It felt like it was just around the corner . <p> This probly was n't a good idea , thinking like this . I wondered if I would be safer inside the house ? Maybe inside , I 'd be out of the wind and away from all the flavors sweeping across the fields . Cinnamon and musk and jasmine . How did I even know all those different scents ? <p> The doorknob glittered like diamond . I turned it and the door swung open . Inside , the house was silent , still , and empty . No furniture here , only an empty shell , a suggestion of a life once lived , exploded outward into solar dazzle , and flare . The windows glowed with the creeping brightness of the world outside . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe to take off my clothes and dance in here . <p> I wandered from room to room , touching each wooden or metal or glass surface . The doors , the walls , the glass of the mirrors . Everything tingled . My fingers caressed . I did n't remember taking off my gloves . I was n't even sure where I 'd left them . This was n't good . I should n't be doing this . All the voices in my head were screaming . Run away , now ! Grab the wire and head back into the dark . Do n't get sucked away . But all the songs were singing even louder . The music whirled and roared . Come dance aloft , be free . Be clear . I cowered shivering under my cape . Eyes clenched shut against the fiery noise . The smells of sweet apricots and cream and gently scented candles . Overwhelmed , I held myself and counted , one and two and three and breathe and one and two and three and breathe <p> No . No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Never . Ever . Did n't come this far to be a golden bird fairy dancer . All the walls are here for a reason . The carefully constructed dark , the comfortable black essence of nothing at all . <p> Upstairs , the house is wide open . Tall windows with billowing white drapes , open to the balcony surrounding the house . Outside , the view went on forever . So bright below , so clear up here . Out to the horizon , the sparkling fields , the waves of rippling air , the colors sparkling and dancing . If I take off my cape , I can feel it like the comforting radiance of the refiner . I stand , arms outstretched to feel the heat , the delicious soul-filling heat . It soaks into my flesh , heals my bones , warms my spirit . I giggle at the wash of sensation . I can feel myself glowing . <p> In the cupola , I twirl alone . Naked and free . Finally warm , and finally here . The frozen winter of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come alive . Joyously alive . I laugh with silly pleasure . I am enchanted . The delight of heat . <p> Am I ready to see ? Can I take off the goggles ? <p> Here on the fenced roof of the cupola , the highest part of the house , I can see the world as far as the darklands , the carefully drawn boundaries of exclusion , every tiny little line etched into the face of the land like the wrinkles of time . The gloom of fear . <p> In the other direction , out toward the east , the south , the west , the land sparkles and shimmers . It dances with light and aliveness . Why would anyone try to hide from all this laughter ? <p> I peeked under the glasses . It was n't pain I felt , it was color , bright color , brightness overwhelming . It was n't pain at all , just the sudden shock of coming alive after being dead so long . An awakening from the grave of gloom . <p> Lift the glasses slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startles . A splash of intensity . Hold my hand in front of my eyes - I can see through my fingers - I am translucent . Pink and gold and glistening . I have taken on the colors of the world . The crimson of my blood gives my skin a rosy blush . The blue of my veins resonates . I am a roseate glow of violet and vermilion . I lower my hand , and all the rest of the colors of the world flood in . All the smells and sensations . All the wonderful noises . All the heat and the light and the delicious flood of everything roiling together in a cascading symphony of being . <p> As I focus , I see ... them . They 've been there all along . Waiting for me . I just could n't see them until now . Laugh and wave in radiant delight . They recognize me as one of them now . The dancing one is Doey . The others , also dancing , used to be the Trasks . I can hear the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening space , I am down among them , laughing with them . A moment of pause . Doey and I , face to face . Can I dance with you now ? What a silly question . We 're already dancing . <p> There are men with guns , hunting you . Hunting us . I wave toward the horizon . Doey laughs . He holds up the ends of the darkwires . The terminator boxes have been removed . The wires are dead - no , not dead , coming alive , infusing with clarity . Even metal can be bright . <p> Doey sparkles . Laugh with me and we 'll dance the ends of these wires out to the distant south , out into the solar dazzle . Anyone who follows these lines will end up enchanted in the luminous day . The men will either dance or die . Whatever they choose . Doey twirls and passes out the tingling wires . I join him singing . <p> Author Affiliation                 @ @ @ @
