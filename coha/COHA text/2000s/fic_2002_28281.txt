Right here and now , as an old friend used to say , we are in the fluid present , where clear-sightedness never guarantees perfect vision . Here : about two hundred feet , the height of a gliding eagle , above Wisconsin 's far western edge , where the vagaries of the Mississippi River declare a natural border . Now : an early Friday morning in mid-July a few years into both a new century and a new millennium , their wayward courses so hidden that a blind man has a better chance of seeing what lies ahead than you or I. Right here and now , the hour is just past six a.m. , and the sun stands low in the cloudless eastern sky , a fat , confident yellow-white ball advancing as ever for the first time toward the future and leaving in its wake the steadily accumulating past , which darkens as it recedes , making blind men of us all . Below , the early sun touches the river 's wide , soft ripples with molten highlights . Sunlight glints from the tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riverbank and the backs of the shabby two-story houses along County Road Oo , known as Nailhouse Row , the lowest point of the comfortable-looking little town extending uphill and eastward beneath us . At this moment in the Coulee Country , life seems to be holding its breath . The motionless air around us carries such remarkable purity and sweetness that you might imagine a man could smell a radish pulled out of the ground a mile away . Moving toward the sun , we glide away from the river and over the shining tracks , the backyards and roofs of Nailhouse Row , then a line of Harley-Davidson motorcycles tilted on their kickstands . These unprepossessing little houses were built , early in the centuryrecently vanished , for the metal pourers , mold makers , and crate men employed by the Pederson Nail factory . On the grounds that working stiffs would be unlikely to complain about the flaws in their subsidized accommodations , they were constructed as cheaply as possible . ( Pederson Nail , which had suffered multiple hemorrhages during the fifties , finally bled to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory hands have been replaced by a motorcycle gang . The uniformly ferocious appearance of the Harleys ' owners , wild-haired , bushy-bearded , swag-bellied men sporting earrings , black leather jackets , and less than the full complement of teeth , would seem to support this assumption . Like most assumptions , this one embodies an uneasy half-truth . The current residents of Nailhouse Row , whom suspicious locals dubbed the Thunder Five soon after they took over the houses along the river , can not so easily be categorized . They have skilled jobs in the Kingsland Brewing Company , located just out of town to the south and one block east of the Mississippi . If we look to our right , we can see " the world 's largest six-pack , " storage tanks painted over with gigantic Kingsland Old-Time Lager labels . The men who live on Nailhouse Row met one another on the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois , where all but one were undergraduates majoring in English or philosophy . ( The exception was a resident in surgery at the UI-UC university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Thunder Five : the name strikes them as sweetly cartoonish . What they call themselves is " the Hegelian Scum . " These gentlemen form an interesting crew , and we will make their acquaintance later on . For now , we have time only to note the hand-painted posters taped to the fronts of several houses , two lamp poles , and a couple of abandoned buildings . The posters say : fisherman , you better pray to your stinking god we do n't catch you first ! remember amy ! From Nailhouse Row , Chase Street runs steeply uphill between listing buildings with worn , unpainted facades the color of fog : the old Nelson Hotel , where a few impoverished residents lie sleeping , a blank-faced tavern , a tired shoe store displaying Red Wing workboots behind its filmy picture window , a few other dim buildings that bear no indication of their function and seem oddly dreamlike and vaporous . These structures have the air of failed resurrections , of having been rescued from the dark westward territory although they were still dead . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An ocher horizontal stripe , ten feet above the sidewalk on the facade of the Nelson Hotel and two feet from the rising ground on the opposed , ashen faces of the last two buildings , represents the high-water mark left behind by the flood of 1965 , when the Mississippi rolled over its banks , drowned the railroad tracks and Nailhouse Row , and mounted nearly to the top of Chase Street . Where Chase rises above the flood line and levels out , it widens and undergoes a transformation into the main street of French Landing , the town beneath us . The Agincourt Theater , the Taproom Bar &; Grille , the First Farmer State Bank , the Samuel Stutz Photography Studio ( which does a steady business in graduation photos , wedding pictures , and children 's portraits ) and shops , not the ghostly relics of shops , line its blunt sidewalks : Benton 's Rexall drugstore , Reliable Hardware , Saturday Night Video , Regal Clothing , Schmitt 's Allsorts Emporium , stores selling electronic equipment , magazines and greeting cards , toys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Twins , the Packers , the Vikings , and the University of Wisconsin . After a few blocks , the name of the street changes to Lyall Road , and the buildings separate and shrink into one-story wooden structures fronted with signs advertising insurance offices and travel agencies ; after that , the street becomes a highway that glides eastward past a 7-Eleven , the Reinhold T. Grauerhammer VFW Hall , a big farm-implement dealership known locally as Goltz 's , and into a landscape of flat , unbroken fields . If we rise another hundred feet into the immaculate air and scan what lies beneath and ahead , we see kettle moraines , coulees , blunted hills furry with pines , loam-rich valleys invisible from ground level until you have come upon them , meandering rivers , miles-long patchwork fields , and little towns -- one of them , Centralia , no more than a scattering of buildings around the intersection of two narrow highways , 35 and 93 . Directly below us , French Landing looks as though it had been evacuated in the middle of the night . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key into one of the locks of the shop fronts along Chase Street . The angled spaces before the shops are empty of the cars and pickup trucks that will begin to appear , first by ones and twos , then in a mannerly little stream , an hour or two later . No lights burn behind the windows in the commercial buildings or the unpretentious houses lining the surrounding streets . A block north of Chase on Sumner Street , four matching red-brick buildings of two stories each house , in west-east order , the French Landing Public Library ; the offices of Patrick J. Skarda , M.D. , the local general practitioner , and Bell &; Holland , a two-man law firm now run by Garland Bell and Julius Holland , the sons of its founders ; the Heartfield &; Son Funeral Home , now owned by a vast , funereal empire centered in St. Louis ; and the French Landing Post Office . Separated from these by a wide driveway into a good-sized parking lot at the rear , the building at the end of the block , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red brick and two stories high but longer than its immediate neighbors . Unpainted iron bars block the rear second-floor windows , and two of the four vehicles in the parking lot are patrol cars with light bars across their tops and the letters flpd on their sides . The presence of police cars and barred windows seems incongruous in this rural fastness -- what sort of crime can happen here ? Nothing serious , surely ; surely nothing worse than a little shoplifting , drunken driving , and an occasional bar fight . As if in testimony to the peacefulness and regularity of small-town life , a red van with the words la riviere herald on its side panels drifts slowly down Third Street , pausing at nearly all of the mailbox stands for its driver to insert copies of the day 's newspaper , wrapped in a blue plastic bag , into gray metal cylinders bearing the same words . When the van turns onto Sumner , where the buildings have mail slots instead of boxes , the route man simply throws the wrapped papers at the front doors . Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral home , and the office buildings . The post office does not get a paper . What do you know , lights are burning behind the front downstairs windows of the police station . The door opens . A tall , dark-haired young man in a pale blue short-sleeved uniform shirt , a Sam Browne belt , and navy trousers steps outside . The wide belt and the gold badge on Bobby Dulac 's chest gleam in the fresh sunlight , and everything he is wearing , including the 9mm pistol strapped to his hip , seems as newly made as Bobby Dulac himself . He watches the red van turn left onto Second Street , and frowns at the rolled newspaper . He nudges it with the tip of a black , highly polished shoe , bending over just far enough to suggest that he is trying to read the headlines through the plastic . Evidently this technique does not work all that well . Still frowning , Bobby tilts all the way over and picks up the newspaper with unexpected delicacy , the way a mother cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a little distance away from his body , he gives a quick glance up and down Sumner Street , about-faces smartly , and steps back into the station . We , who in our curiosity have been steadily descending toward the interesting spectacle presented by Officer Dulac , go inside behind him . A gray corridor leads past a blank door and a bulletin board with very little on it to two sets of metal stairs , one going down to a small locker room , shower stalls , and a firing range , the other upward to an interrogation room and two facing rows of cells , none presently occupied . Somewhere near , a radio talk show is playing at a level that seems too loud for a peaceful morning . Bobby Dulac opens the unmarked door and enters , with us on his shiny heels , the ready room he has just left . A rank of filing cabinets stands against the wall to our right , beside them a beat-up wooden table on which sit neat stacks of papers in folders and a transistor radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio of KDCU-AM , Your Talk Voice in the Coulee Country , the entertainingly rabid George Rathbun has settled into Badger Barrage , his popular morning broadcast . Good old George sounds too loud for the occasion no matter how low you dial the volume ; the guy is just flat-out noisy -- that 's part of his appeal . Set in the middle of the wall directly opposite us is a closed door with a dark pebble-glass window on which has been painted dale gilbertson , chief of police . Dale will not be in for another half hour or so . Two metal desks sit at right angles to each other in the corner to our left , and from the one that faces us , Tom Lund , a fair-haired officer of roughly his partner 's age but without his appearance of having been struck gleaming from the mint five minutes before , regards the bag tweezed between two fingers of Bobby Dulac 's right hand . " All right , " Lund says . " Okay . The latest installment . " " You thought maybe the Thunder Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to read the damn thing . " Not deigning to look at the newspaper , Bobby sends the new day 's issue of the La Riviere Herald sailing in a flat , fast arc across ten feet of wooden floor with an athletic snap of his wrist , spins rightward , takes a long stride , and positions himself in front of the wooden table a moment before Tom Lund fields his throw . Bobby glares at the two names and various details scrawled on the long chalkboard hanging on the wall behind the table . He is not pleased , Bobby Dulac ; he looks as though he might burst out of his uniform through the sheer force of his anger . Fat and happy in the KDCU studio , George Rathbun yells , " Caller , gim me a break , willya , and get your prescription fixed ! Are we talking about the same game here ? Caller --  " " Maybe Wendell got some sense and decided to lay off , " Tom Lund says . " Wendell , " Bobby says . Because Lund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , the little sneering thing he does with his lip wastes motion , but he does it anyway . " Caller , let me ask you this one question , and in all sincerity , I want you to be honest with me . Did you actually see last night 's game ? " " I did n't know Wendell was a big buddy of yours , " Bobby says . " I did n't know you ever got as far south as La Riviere . Here I was thinking your idea of a big night out was a pitcher of beer and trying to break one hundred at the Arden Bowl-A-Drome , and now I find out you hang out with newspaper reporters in college towns . Probably get down and dirty with the Wisconsin Rat , too , that guy on KWLA . Do you pick up a lot of punk babes that way ? " The caller says he missed the first inning on account of he had to pick up his kid after a special counseling session at Mount Hebron , but he sure saw everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of mine ? " asks Tom Lund . Over Bobby 's left shoulder he can see the first of the names on the chalkboard . His gaze helplessly focuses on it . " It 's just , I met him after the Kinderling case , and the guy did n't seem so bad . Actually , I kind of liked him . Actually , I wound up feeling sorry for him . He wanted to do an interview with Hollywood , and Hollywood turned him down flat . " Well , naturally he saw the extra innings , the hapless caller says , that 's how he knows Pokey Reese was safe . " And as for the Wisconsin Rat , I would n't know him if I saw him , and I think that so-called music he plays sounds like the worst bunch of crap I ever heard in my life . How did that scrawny pasty-face creep get a radio show in the first place ? On the college station ? What does that tell you about our wonderful UW-La Riviere , Bobby ? What does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you like that shit . " " No , I like 311 and Korn , and you 're so out of it you ca n't tell the difference between Jonathan Davis and Dee Dee Ramone , but forget about that , all right ? " Slowly , Bobby Dulac turns around and smiles at his partner . " Stop stalling . " His smile is none too pleasant . " I 'm stalling ? " Tom Lund widens his eyes in a parody of wounded innocence . " Gee , was it me who fired the paper across the room ? No , I guess not . " From the Paperback edition .
