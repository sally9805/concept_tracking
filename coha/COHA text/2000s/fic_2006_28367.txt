Chapter One The club was from another age . So was Mother . The Woman 's Association of Northern California , Conquistadores Chapter Number XVI , was housed in a sumptuous turn-of-the-century , **28;905;TOOLONG castle topped by crenellations and turrets , and constructed of massive blocks of mauve-gray Deer Isle granite from a long-dead quarry in Maine . The interior was predictable : somber and dark save for stained-glass windows featuring historical Gold Rush scenes that blew jeweled patches on the walls when the sun shone through . Antique Persian rugs softened well-worn walnut floors , the staircase banister gleamed from decades of polish , thirty-foot ceilings were coffered and rimmed with gold . The ground floor of the building held all the public rooms , the two floors above contained sleeping chambers for the members . Mother had been a member of the Association for more than fifty years and sometimes slept over in a room far too modest for her . But the fees were nominal , and nostalgia was worth something . Her dinners at the club were frequent . They made her feel special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gritted her teeth and indulged Mother 's preferences because the woman was a not-too-healthy eighty . Most dinners meant Mother and various selections of dear friends , each one of them more than a step out of time . The entire concept ofthe Association with its genteel Gatsby pretensions would have been anachronistic anywhere . Nowhere was it more absurd than here in Berkeley . A stroll from the club was the People 's Park , originally conceived as a monument to free speech but reduced to a square block of homeless encampments and ad hoc soup kitchens . Good intentions in the abstract , but the brown rectangle reeked of unwashed bodies and decaying food and on hot days anyone not blessed by nasal congestion kept a wide berth . Not far from the park was the Gourmet Ghetto , the foodie mecca that typified Berkeley 's mix of hedonism and idealism . And dominating it all , the UC . It was these contrasts that gave the city a unique character , with everything blanketed by a definite Point of View . Davida loved the city with all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now part of the system , duly elected state representative from District 14 . She loved her district and she loved her constituents . She loved the energy and the electricity of a town stoked by people who cared about issues . So different from her hometown , Sacramento , where dishing dirt was respectable recreation . And yet , here she was commuting back to the capital . All for a good cause . Tonight the dome-roofed , hush-hush dining room was dense with tables dressed with starched linen and sparkling silver and crystal , but shy on diners . Members were dying off and very few women elected to follow in their mothers ' footsteps . Davida had joined the Association a few years back because it was politically smart to do so . She knew most of the members as friends of her mother and they enjoyed the attention she paid them . Their monetary contributions were stingy compared to their assets , but at least they gave-more than Davida could say about a lot of her own allegedly altruistic pals . Tonight , it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davida and her mother silently scanned tonight 's choices . The entres , once biased toward steaks and chops , had conceded to present-day realities with more chicken and fish . The food was excellent , Davida had to grant that . In Berkeley , bad food was almost as serious an iniquity as being a Republican . Mother insisted on flirting with the waiter , an elfin-looking man in his thirties named Tony who was undoubtedly gay . Mother damn well knew he was gay but she batted her lashes like a moony adolescent . Tony played his part by smiling and batting back . His lashes outclassed Mother's-thicker and darker than any man 's deserved to be . Davida knew Mother was worried , trying to mask it with a false cheer . Still dwelling on the incident . Though it had seemed like a big deal last week-and certainly demeaning-Davida now had the perspective to see it for what it had been : a stupid prank executed by stupid people . Eggs . Sticky , repellent , but not dangerous . Still , Mother brooded as she forked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because dealing with Mother tightened up her esophagus . If the wall of silence did n't come down , both of them would end up with indigestion and Davida would leave the club in need of ... something . Davida loved her mother , but Lucille Grayson was a supreme pain in the ass . Lucille called Mr. Eyelash over , asked for a refill of Chardonnay and drained it quickly . Maybe alcohol would settle her down . Tony returned and announced the specials . Mother ordered the blackened Chilean sea bass and Davida opted for the linguini with chicken in vodka and sun-dried tomato sauce . Tony gave a dancer 's bow and sailed away . " You look good , " said Davida . Not a lie . Lucille maintained clear blue eyes , a sharp nose , prominent chin and strong teeth . Thick , luxuriant hair for an old woman , once auburn , now a gray one shade darker than the club 's granite walls . Davida hoped she 'd age as well . Decent odds ; she bore an uncanny resemblance to Mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver strand . Mother did n't answer . " Your skin looks great , " said Davida . " It 's the facials , " Mother responded . " When-and if-you go to the spa , ask for Marty . " " I 'll go . " " So you say . How long has it been , Davida , since you 've taken care of your skin ? " " I 've had other things on my mind . " " I bought you a certificate . " " It was a terrific gift , thank you , Mother . " " It 's a stupid gift if you do n't use it . " " Mother , it does n't have an expiration date . Do n't worry . It 'll get used . If not by me , I 'm sure Minette will be happy to indulge . " Mother 's jaw set . She forced a smile . " No doubt she would be . However , she is n't my daughter . " She picked up her wineglass and sipped , trying for nonchalance but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruise ... on the apple of your right cheek . " Davida nodded . " The cover-up must have come off . How bad does it look ? " " Well , darling , you would n't want to face your public like that . " " True . " Davida smiled . " They might think that you were beating up on me . " Mother did n't appreciate the humor . Her eyes misted . " Bastards ! " " I agree . " Davida took the old woman 's hand , the skin nearly translucent , traced with delicate veins the color of a misty sky . " I 'm fine . Please do n't worry . " " Any idea yet who did it ? " " Stupid kids . " " That 's ambiguous and elusive and I 'm not the press , Davida . Have the police made any arrests ? " " Not yet . I 'll let you know when it happens . " " When , not if ? " Davida did n't answer . A Latino busboy murmured something polite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entres . Davida wondered why , in fine restaurants , the busboys always served the meal . What were the waiters ? Food Transport Consultants ? She thanked him in Spanish and swirled a forkful of pasta . " Delicious . How 's your food , Mother ? " " Fine . " Again blue eyes clouded . Lucille looked close to tears . " What is it , Mother ? " " It could have been bullets . " " Luckily , it was n't . So let 's just enjoy this meal and being together . " Which was an oxymoron because whenever they were together conflict was inevitable . Mother harrumphed , and then abruptly plastered a smile across her face as she waved across the room to two women who 'd just entered . Darlene MacIntyre and Eunice Meyerhoff . The duo hobbled over to the table , tongues clucking in unison . Darlene was short and pudgy , Eunice tall and severe with impossibly black hair drawn back in a Dragon Lady bun . Lucille blew air kisses . " Darling ! " Eunice gushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else ? Enjoying a dinner with my busy daughter . " Eunice turned her eyes to Davida . " Are you all right , honey ? " " I 'm fine . Thanks for asking . " " That was just terrible ! " Lucille said , " Not to mention frightening . " Darlene said , " Motherfuckers ! " Davida broke into laughter , but was grateful that the room was empty . " I could n't have said it better , Mrs. MacIntyre . " She took a sip of her wine . " Would you two like to join us ? " " We would n't dream of intruding , " Eunice said . " Your mother rarely sees you . " " Is that what she tells you ? " " All the time , dear . " Davida shot a mock-stern look at Mother then focused her gaze back to the two old women . " Well , then , it 's lovely to see you both . Enjoy your evening . " " You , too , " Darlene answered . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they 'd toddled off , Davida said , " I hardly see you ? " Mother reddened slightly . " Eunice is a troublemaker ... I do n't complain about you chronically , Davida . That battleaxe is smitten with jealousy because her Jane detests her . " " Is n't that a bit of an exaggeration ? " " Hardly , Davida . Eunice sided with Jane 's ex during the last divorce . Though I suppose one can understand her frustration , seeing as it was a third divorce . " Sly smile . " Or perhaps sixth . Or twenty-sixth , I 've lost count . " " Third , " Davida said . " I heard about Eunice taking Parker 's side . On top of being tacky and disloyal , it was misguided . Parker Seldey 's a jerk and a maniac . " " But good-looking . " " Once upon a time . I hear he has quite the temper . " " So do I , but that does n't concern Eunice . Because he was courtly to her-remembering her birthday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One 's blood is one 's blood . Still , by the same token , despite Eunice 's quirks , Jane should n't despise her . " " She 's angry at Eunice , but she does n't hate her , Mother . Believe me , I know . " Jane Meyerhoff had been Davida 's friend since grade school and one of her roomies at the UC . Both had been rebellious teenagers , smoking dope , skipping school , hauled in more than once for petty theft in Sacramento . Stupid self-destructive acts committed because neither girl liked herself . Jane had carried fifty extra pounds and hated her " summer squash " nose . She starved and vomited the weight off during her freshman year in college , got the nose job as a junior . But old self-images die hard , and Jane had never been comfortable with who she was . Probably never would be comfortable , Davida decided with some sadness . She , on the other hand , came to grips with herself well before college . Everything changed a few months before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child : painful , but you had something to show for it . Coming out meant life was suddenly honest-illuminated by a clean , bright light Davida had never imagined . She chewed her pasta while glancing across the table . Mother had many faults , but homophobia was n't one of them . She 'd never given a rat 's ass that her only surviving child was gay . Perhaps it was because Mother , though resolutely heterosexual , did n't care for men in general and hated Davida 's father , in specific . The Honorable Stanford R. Grayson , District Court Judge ( ret. ) , now lived in Sarasota , Florida , where he played golf with a second wife twenty years younger than Lucille . Mother had been thrilled when the old man got re-hitched , for now she had something else to complain about . And Father had step-grandchildren with Mixie , so he ignored Davida and left her all to Lucille . If Mother ever felt pangs about her lack of grandchildren , she never expressed her longings to Davida . Mother picked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How often do you see Janey ? " " A bit more since she moved to Berkeley . " Davida smiled tightly . " I try to keep in contact with all my old college roomies . " Mother had wanted her daughter to go to Stanford . Davida insisted on Berkeley . Once there , she 'd never really left , working first as an assistant to the mayor , then moving to the capital , where she gofered for Ned Yellin , the most progressive member of the assembly . Ned 's shockingly sudden death from a heart attack had propelled her own career . Now she represented her district with workaholic pride and loved her job . Although there were days like yesterday that made her wonder why she 'd ever shaken the hornet 's nest that was state politics . It was challenge enough to deal with the vagaries of constituents basically in harmony with her views . Working with-and around-her less-enlightened colleagues could be as frustrating as ... there really was n't anything worse . Less enlightened ; her euphemism of the month . Bigoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone had his own agenda . She certainly had hers and it had nothing to do with sexual orientation . When she was ten , her older sister Glynnis had finally succumbed to her protracted battle with rhabdomyosarcoma , a rare muscle tumor . Davida had loved her sister and watching Glynnis spend her last days confined to a hospital bed , hooked up to tubes , clammy gown wrapped around a sallow , stick-thin body , bleeding from her gums and nose ... Glynnis ' blood cells were in steady retreat and there were no new donors to be found . Stem cells would have saved Glynnis , Davida was convinced of that . How different would things have been for the Grayson family if the scientific community had been funded righteously ? Two and a half years ago , Davida had been heartened when the people voted in an initiative funding a state stem-cell institute . But years later , she was disillusioned and angry : all the institute had accomplished was creating a board of directors and issuing a namby-pamby mission statement . " Science works gradually " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People like Alice had the answer , but Alice had n't even been consulted by the new board-Davida 's repeated requests notwithstanding . She decided she 'd waited long enough . Buttressed by a battalion of scientists , doctors , clergy , humanists and genetic sufferers , she went to war every day in Sacramento , laboring to convince her less-enlightened colleagues that a less grandiose but more efficient legislative approach was the answer . And got precious little for her efforts . It was n't that the stodgy pols really cared about aborted fetuses , because she 'd learned that few pols cared about anything other than getting reelected . Though they screamed a good case . Six months into her struggle , she was convinced it was Davida they were rejecting . Because of who she was . Day after day of wearing out her vocal cords , making deals she really did n't want to make , wasting hours on mind-numbing meetings . Now eggs in her face , on her blouse ... right there on the capitol steps , the humiliation . What a mess-there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the here and now . Prattling on about dangers lurking around every corner . According to Lucille , Davida was a major target of every white-supremacist hate group in California , not to mention Bible Belt pro-lifers , hypermacho antigay farmers from the San Joaquin Valley , and , of course , misogynists of every stripe and gender . She recalled Mother 's first words after the election results were tallied and Davida 's supporters broke into raised-fist cheers in the social hall of the old Finnish church . Be careful , dear . Do n't get cocky and think because you can get elected here that you 're really popular . Mother was being her typical negative self , but there was some truth to her admonitions . Davida knew she 'd made many enemies , many of whom she had never met . ( Continues ... )
