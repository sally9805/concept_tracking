TUESDAY , MARCH 31 , 8:45 P.M. CEST BABROSTY , POLAND <p> Empty shell casings skittered across the cement floor , propelled by the underside of the mercenary 's boots . As he strode down the hall , his eyes remained focused on the door at the end of the passageway-no need to look in the rooms to his right or left ; his men were too good to have left any threat on his periphery . <p> The sooner I deal with this man , the sooner I 'm out of this stinking cesspool , thought Lecha Abdalayev , trying hard not to breathe deep the smell of fresh blood and human waste . <p> Not that he was unfamiliar with those smells . As a veteran of both the First and Second Chechen Wars , he had seen his share of man 's inhumanity against man . He himself had once been in a situation while a prisoner of the Russians when death would have seemed a much sweeter alternative to what he experienced in the daily interrogations . But it was n't long before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gloated with a self-satisfied grunt . <p> When he reached the end of the hall , one of the two men walking with him slid a key into the lock on the solid metal cell door . <p> " Wait . " Abdalayev took a moment to straighten the black beret that was sitting on his bald head . Then he ran a hand over his fatigues and smoothed his long , salt-and-pepper beard over his chest . " Okay . " <p> The lock protested for just a moment ; then the large door slid noisily to the left . Immediately , Abdalayev 's senses were violently assaulted . The smell of human waste that had been strong in the hallway was overwhelming in this room . From somewhere in the room a blaring children 's song came to an end , then just as quickly began again : " I love you ; you love me ... " <p> Abdalayev waited a moment for his eyes to adjust to the brilliance of the four floodlights , then entered the room . <p> In the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrists and ankles to a reversed metal chair , while a wide fabric belt held his chest tightly against the chair 's back . Except for the restraints , he was completely naked . <p> The battle-scarred prisoner stared at Abdalayev with his one remaining eye . A crooked smile had spread across his mangled face . Hanging over his back were two I.V . bags-one attached to a line that went into the man 's arm , the other positioned to slowly drip down his back . As Abdalayev watched , another drop released from the bag and fell onto a large red welt , causing the old man to wince and a tear to slide from his good eye . But he never lost his smile . <p> The Chechen renewed his determination to do this fast and get out . Drawing his pistol , he pointed it toward the prisoner . Abdalayev was gratified to see the sudden fear in the elder warrior 's face-just a reminder of who was in charge of this operation . He pulled the trigger , shattering the portable CD player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the music . <p> Looking to one of his men , he said , " Cover him . " The soldier pulled a Mylar foil rescue blanket out of his pack and laid it over the old man 's shoulders . Abdalayev settled his eyes upon the man in the chair . Reaching into his shirt , he pulled out a photograph . He examined the photo , then held it out so he could see both the picture and the prisoner 's battered face at one time . Satisfied that they were one and the same , he tucked the picture away . <p> " My name is Lecha Abdalayev , " the visitor said in accented Arabic . " I am the commander of the Chechen Freedom Militia . We have been asked by your friends to assist them in retrieving you . Are you able- " <p> " Where am I ? " the prisoner interrupted . <p> " You are just outside of Babrosty , Poland , in a prison belonging to the American CIA . Now , I respectfully ask you not to interrupt me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As you can imagine , time now is of the essence . " <p> The old man nodded his acquiescence . <p> " It is obvious that you will not be able to travel unassisted . Do I have your permission to immobilize you ? " Abdalayev asked , knowing he was going to do it no matter the answer . <p> " Do what you must . " <p> Abdalayev waved to another mercenary who was standing just outside the door . The captive 's eyes grew wide as the soldier walked rapidly across the room and plunged a large hypodermic syringe into his neck . Immediately , the old man 's head slumped . <p> " Bundle him up , and let 's go , " Abdalayev commanded , turning to walk away and wondering how much vodka it was going to take to get this visual out of his mind . <p> As he left the room , he was forced to step over the body of the man who had been guarding the cell-a quick glance was n't enough to tell Abdalayev whether he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about killing Americans , he thought with a small smile . It 's like the difference between shooting a common deer and hunting big game . <p> As he walked , Abdalayev took time to glance at the empty cells around him . Just inside one of these doors , the twisted bodies of two of his mercenaries and a guard were sprawled on top of each other in a spreading pool of blood that crossed the entire hall . Abdalayev did n't bother checking on his men . Dead or soon to be dead ; not much difference today . He continued on , leaving a trail of bloody bootprints behind him . <p> When he reached the main courtyard , the four other Arabs who had been held prisoner at the facility were lined up on their knees . <p> " As-Salamu ' Alaykum , " he said to them , conveying the traditional Muslim greeting of peace . <p> " Wa ' Alaykum As-Salam , " they replied , a look of hope in their swollen eyes . <p> Abdalayev briefly studied their faces . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment given to the old man . He said a silent prayer for them , then told the soldier guarding them , " Kill them . " <p> Abdalayev watched as the men 's souls departed for paradise . Insha'Allah , Abdalayev thought , it was obviously their time . If Allah has willed , who can change it ? Allah wills some to live and some to die , some to serve and some to be served , some to be soldiers and some to be victims . Insha'Allah-it is as Allah wills . <p> One thing every young Muslim learned growing up in Chechnya was that Allah often called the few to sacrifice for the many . These men were too infirm to travel on their own , and he could n't just leave them here . The very fact that they were in this secret prison meant that they had access to vital information . If they were recaptured and put to the same treatment again , they would break-everyone broke eventually . It was best just to send them to their eternal reward while there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When the last of the prisoners had stopped moving , Abdalayev said into his comm , " Finish up . Proceed to the rendezvous point immediately . " The agreed-upon spot was a large dying oak tree half a kilometer away and just off the road . <p> After their arrival , the twelve remaining members of Abdalayev 's team would clean themselves up and put on casual business attire . They would also do their best to make the old man look presentable- I 'm glad they mentioned the eye patch , he thought . <p> From there , the team would divide into groups of four and head northeast for the Belarusian border in three rented koda Roomsters . This would hopefully draw any pursuit that might follow . Abdalayev and the former prisoner , meanwhile , would drive a BMW southeast into Ukraine . The mercenary commander was confident that he could make it across the border with his fake passports . It would be difficult for the Americans to raise much of an alert . What could they say- " A man who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed to begin with " ? <p> If only things had been this easy when he was defending Grozny back in 1996 . If that had been successful , then maybe he would be home right now with a wife and sons instead of here with mud on his hands and blood on his boots . <p> But , as every Chechen knew , you took Allah 's will as it came . Some days it brought freedom , and another day it brought a bullet in the back of the head for being in the wrong prison at the wrong time . Insha'Allah . Allah knew what was best ; blessed be his name . <p> Today Allah 's will had brought freedom for al-'Aqran , leader of the Cause . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
