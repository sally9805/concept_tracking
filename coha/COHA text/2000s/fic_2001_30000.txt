Lima , Peru October 1997 The naked parrot looked like a human fetus spliced onto a kosher chicken . It was so old it had lost every single one of its feathers , even its pinfeathers , and its bumpy , jaundiced skin was latticed by a network of rubbery blue veins . " Pathological , " muttered Switters , meaning not simply the parrot but the whole scene , including the shrunken old woman in whose footsteps the bird doggedly followed as she moved about the darkened villa . The parrot 's scabrous claws made a dry , scraping noise as they fought for purchase on the terra-cotta floor tiles , and when , periodically , the creature lost its footing and skidded an inch or two , it issued a squawk so quavery and feeble that it sounded as if it were being petted by the Boston Strangler . Each time it squawked , the crone clucked , whether in sympathy or disapproval one could not tell , for she never turned to her devoted little companion but wandered aimlessly from one piece of ancient wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feigned appreciation , but he was secretly repulsed , all the more so because Juan Carlos , who stood beside him on the patio , also spying in the widow 's windows , was beaming with pride and satisfaction . Switters slapped at the mosquitoes that perforated his torso and cursed every hair on that hand of Fate that had snatched him into South too-goddamn-vivid America . Boquichicos , Peru November 1997 Attracted by the lamplight that seeped through the louvers , a mammoth moth beat against the shutters like a storm . Switters watched it with some fascination as he waited for the boys to bring his luggage up from the river . That moth was no butterfly , that was certain . It was a night animal , and it had a night animal 's mystery . Butterflies were delicate and gossamer , but this moth possessed strength and weight . Its heavy wings were powdered like the face of an old actress . Butterflies were presumed to be carefree , moths were slaves to a fiery obsession . Butterflies seemed innocuous , moths somehow ... erotic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twitch of the moth was a sexual twitch . Suddenly Switters touched his throat and moaned . He moaned because it occurred to him how much the moth resembled a clitoris with wings . Vivid . There were grunts on the path behind him , and Inti emerged from the forest bearing , somewhat apprehensively , Switters 's crocodile-skin valise . In a moment the other two boys appeared with the rest of his gear . It was time to review accommodations in the Hotel Boquichicos . He dreaded what he might find behind its shuttered windows , its double-screened doors , but he motioned for the boys to follow him in . " Let 's go . This insect  --  " He nodded at the great moth that , fan though it might , was unable to stir the steaming green broth that in the Amazon often substitutes for air . " This insect is making me feel  --  " Switters hesitated to utter the word , even though he knew Inti could understand no more than a dozen simple syllables of English .
