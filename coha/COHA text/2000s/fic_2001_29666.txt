Chapter One FIELDS OF INTENTION The phone rang and I just stared at it . The last thing I needed now was another distraction . I tried to push it from my mind , gazing out the window at the trees and wildflowers , hoping to lose myself in the array of fall colors in the woods around my house . It rang again , and I got a vague but stirring image in my mind 's eye of a person needing to talk with me . Quickly I reached over and answered it . " Hello . " " It 's Bill , " a familiar voice said . Bill was an agronomy expert who had been helping me with my garden . He lived down the ridge only a few hundred yards . " Listen , Bill , can I call you back later ? " I said . " I 've got this deadline . " " You have n't met my daughter , Natalie , yet , have you ? " " Excuse me ? " No reply . " Bill ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to talk with you . I think it might be important . I 'm not quite sure how she knows , but she seems to be familiar with your work . She says she has some information about a place you 'd be interested in . Some location in the north of Tibet ? She says the people there have some important information . " " How old is she ? " I asked . Bill chuckled on the other end of the line . " She 's only fourteen , but she 's been saying some really interesting things lately . She was hoping she could talk with you this afternoon , before her soccer game . Any chance ? " I started to put him off , but the earlier image expanded and started to become clear in my mind . It seemed to be of the young girl and me talking somewhere near the big spring just up from her house . " Yeah , okay , " I said . " How about two p.m. ? " " That 's perfect , " Bill said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house across the valley on the north ridge . That makes almost forty , I thought . All in the last two years . I knew the word was out about the beauty of this bowl-shaped valley , but I really was n't worried that the place would become overcrowded or that the amazing natural vistas would be destroyed . Nestled right up next to a national forest , we were ten miles from the closest town-too far away for most people . And the family who owned this land and was now selling selected house sites on the outer ridges seemed determined to keep the serenity of the place unspoiled . Each house had to be low-slung and hidden amid the pines and sweet gums that defined the skyline . What bothered me more was the preference for isolation exhibited by my neighbors . From what I could tell , most were characters of a sort , refugees from careers in various professions , who had carved out unique vocational niches that allowed them to now operate on flextime or travel on their own schedules as consultants-a freedom that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness . The common bonds among all of us seemed to be a persistent idealism and the need to stretch our particular professions by an infusion of spiritual vision , all in the best Tenth Insight tradition . Yet almost everyone in this valley stayed to themselves , content to focus on their diverse fields without much attention to community or the need to build on our common vision . This was especially true among those of different religious persuasions . For some reason , the valley had attracted people holding a wide range of beliefs , including Buddhism , Judaism , both Catholic and Protestant Christianity , and Islam . And while there was no hostility of any kind by one religious group toward another , there was n't a feeling of affinity either . The lack of community concerned me because there were signs that a few of our kids were displaying some of the same problems seen in suburbia : too much time alone , too much video , and too much regard for the slights and put-downs at school . I was beginning to be concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives to push these peer problems into the background and keep them in proper perspective . Up ahead the path narrowed , and I had to make my way between two large boulders that edged right up to a sheer drop-off of about two hundred feet . Once past , I could hear the first gurgles of Phillips ' Spring , named by the fur trappers that first set up a camp here in the late seventeenth century . The water trickled down several tiers of rocks into a lazy pool ten feet across that had originally been dug out by hand . Successive generations had added features , such as apple trees up near the mouth and mortared stone to reinforce and deepen the pool . I walked up to the water and reached down to cup some in my hand , brushing a stick out of the way as I leaned forward . The stick kept moving , slithering up the rock face and into a hole . " Cottonmouth ! " I said aloud , stepping back and feeling the sweat pop out on my brow . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although not perhaps the ones that old man Phillips faced centuries ago , when you could turn a corner on the path one day and come face-to-face with a big cougar guarding her young , or worse , a pack of wild boars with three-inch tusks that would slit your leg wide open if you did n't get up a tree fast enough . If the day was going especially bad , you might even come upon an angry Cherokee or a displaced Seminole who was tired of finding some new settler on his favorite hunting grounds ... and was harboring the conviction that a large bite of your heart would stem the European tide forever . No , everyone alive in that generation-Native Americans and Europeans alike-faced direct perils that tested one 's mettle and courage in the moment . Our generation seemed to be dealing with other problems , problems that are more related to our attitude toward life , and the constant battle between optimism and despair . Everywhere are the voices of doom these days , showing us factual evidence that the modern Western lifestyle ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorists ' arsenals growing , the forests dying , and the technology running wild into a kind of virtual world that makes our kids crazy-and threatens to take us further and further into distraction and aimless surrealism . Countering this viewpoint , of course , are the optimists , who claim that history has been filled with doomsayers , that all our problems can be handled by the same technology that produced these perils , and that the human world has only begun to reach its potential . I stopped and looked out at the valley again . I knew that the Celestine Vision lay somewhere in between these poles . It encompassed a belief in sustainable growth and humane technology , but only if pursued by an intuitive move toward the sacred , and an optimism based on a spiritual vision of where the world can go . One thing was certain . If those who believe in the power of vision were to make a difference , it had to begin right now , when we 're poised in the mystery of the new millennium . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky enough to be the ones alive when not only a century changed but a thousand-year period as well . Why us ? Why this generation ? I got the feeling that larger answers were still ahead . I looked around the spring for a moment , half expecting Natalie to be up here somewhere . I was sure this was the intuition I 'd had . She 'd been here at the spring , only I seemed to be looking at her through a window of some kind . It was all very confusing . When I arrived at her house , there seemed to be no one home . I walked onto the deck of the dark brown A-frame and knocked on the door loudly . No answer . Then , as I glanced around the left side of the house , something grabbed my attention . I was looking down a rock pathway that led past Bill 's huge vegetable garden and up to a small grassy meadow on the very top of the ridge . Had the light changed ? I looked up at the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a shift in the light in the meadow as though the sun had been behind a cloud and then had suddenly peaked out , illuminating that specific area . But there were no clouds . I strolled up to the meadow and found the young girl sitting at the edge of the grass . She was tall and dark-haired , wearing a blue soccer uniform , and as I approached , she jerked around , startled . " Did n't mean to scare you , " I said . She looked away for a moment in the shy way a teenager might , so I squatted down to be at her eye level and introduced myself . She looked back at me with eyes much older than I expected . " We are n't living the Insights here , " she said . I was taken aback . " What ? " " The Insights . We are n't living them . " " What do you mean ? " She looked at me sternly . " I mean , we have n't figured it out completely . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not that easy ... " I stopped . I could n't believe I was being confronted by a fourteen-year-old like this . For an instant a flash of anger swept across me . But then Natalie smiled-not a large smile , just an expression at the edges of her mouth that made her endearing . I relaxed and sat down on the ground . " I believe the Insights are real , " I said . " But they are n't easy . It takes time . " She was n't letting up . " But there are people who are living them now . " I looked at her for a moment . " Where ? " " In central Asia . The Kunlun Mountains . I 've seen it on the map . " She sounded excited . " You have to go there . It 's important . There 's something changing . You have to go there now . You have to see it . " As she said this , the expression on her face looked mature , authoritative , like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was seeing . " You have to go there , " she repeated . " Natalie , " I said , " I 'm not sure where you mean . What kind of place is it ? " She looked away . " You said you saw it on the map . Can you show it to me ? " She ignored my question , looking distracted . " What ... what time is it ? " she asked slowly , stuttering . " Two-fifteen . " " I got ta go . " " Wait , Natalie , this place you were talking about . I- " " I got ta meet the team , " she said . " I 'm going to be late . " She was walking fast now , and I struggled to reach her . " What about this place in Asia , can you remember exactly where it is ? " As she glanced back at me over her shoulder , I saw only the expression of a fourteen-year-old girl with her mind on soccer . Back at home I found myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at my desk , unable to concentrate . Later I took a long walk and a swim in the creek , finally deciding to call Bill in the morning and get to the bottom of the mystery . I retired early . At about 3:00 A.M. something woke me . The room was dark . The only light was seeping in around the base of the window blinds . I listened intently , hearing nothing but the usual sounds of the night : an intermittent chorus of crickets , the occasional drone of bullfrogs down by the creek , and far away , the low bark of a dog . I thought about getting up and locking the doors of the house , something I seldom ever did . But I shrugged off the idea , content to let myself ease back into sleep . I would have faded away altogether , except that in my last sleepy glance about the room , I noticed something different at the window . There was more light outside than before . I sat up and looked again . There was definitely more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pants and walked over to the window and parted the wooden slats . Everything appeared normal . Where had that light come from ? Suddenly I heard a light knocking behind me . Someone was in the house . " Who 's there ? " I asked without thinking . No answer . I walked out of the bedroom and into the hall that led to the living room , thinking about going to the closet and getting out my snake rifle . But I realized the key to the closet was back in the dresser drawer by the bed . Instead I carefully walked on . Without warning , a hand touched my shoulder . " Shhhhh , it 's Wil . " I recognized the voice and nodded . When I reached for the light on the wall , he stopped me , then walked across the room and looked out through the window . As he moved , I realized that something about him was different from the last time I had seen him . He was somehow less graceful , and his features seemed completely ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looking for ? " I asked . " What 's going on ? You scared me half to death . " He walked back toward me . " I had to see you . Everything has changed . I 'm back where I was . " " What do you mean ? " He smiled at me . " I think all this is supposed to be happening , but I can no longer enter the other dimensions mentally , the way I could . I can still raise my energy to some degree , but I 'm now firmly here in this world . " He looked away for an instant . " It 's almost as though what we did in understanding the Tenth Insight was just a taste , a preview , a glimpse of the future like in a near-death experience , and now it 's over . Whatever we 're to do now , we have to do right here on this Earth . " " I never could do it again anyway , " I said . Wil looked me in the eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information about human evolution , about paying attention , about being guided forward by intuition and the coincidences . We 've been given a mandate to hold a new vision , all of us . Only we are n't making it happen at the level we can . Something in our knowledge is still missing . " He paused for a minute and then said , " I 'm not sure why yet , but we have to go to Asia ... somewhere near Tibet . Something is happening there . Something we have to know . " I was startled . Young Natalie had said the same thing . Wil walked back to the window again , peering out . " Why do you keep looking out the window ? " I asked . " And why did you slip into the house ? Why did n't you just knock ? What 's going on ? " " Probably nothing , " he replied . " I just thought I was being followed earlier today . I could n't be sure . " He walked back toward me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sure myself of what is happening . But there is a place in Asia we must find . Can you meet me at the Hotel Himalaya in Kathmandu on the sixteenth ? " " Wait a minute ! Wil , I have things to do here . I 'm committed to ... " Wil looked at me with an expression I 've never seen on anyone 's face but his , a pure mixture of adventure and total intent . " It 's okay , " he said . " If you 're not there on the sixteenth , you 're not there . Just be sure if you come that you stay perfectly alert . Something will occur . " He was serious about giving me the choice , but he was smiling broadly . I looked away , unamused . I did n't want to do this . The next morning I decided I would tell no one where I was going except Charlene . The only problem was that she was on an assignment out of the country and it was impossible to reach her directly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked over to my computer and sent it , wondering , as I always did , about the security of the Internet . Hackers can get into the most secure corporate and government computers . How hard would it be to intercept E-mail messages ... Continues ...
