Her passion for theater and film is undiminished . There are always directing , acting , writing projects in the mix or on her to-do list . And then there 's her work as a distinguished professor at Wake Forest University in Winston- Salem , North Carolina , where she holds a lifetime chair and students vie for admission to her seminar series . // The woman who never attended college has been the recipient of dozens of honorary degrees in recognition of all her accomplishments and takes due pride in being called Dr. Angelou . A serious scholar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learning , to new ideas , to questions . She 's a voracious and eclectic reader and a connoisseur of libraries . She is multilingual , fluent in French , Spanish , Fanti , Italian , and Arabic-a reflection of a native gift , a highly tuned ear and appreciation for the nuances of language , and of her keen desire to live in the world . // Living in the world also means working to improve the quality of life on the planet . She is and has long been a tireless activist lending support to efforts to improve the lives of women and children , championing education , racial , gender , social , and economic justice , human rights , and peace . // She 's a woman , an African American woman , a Renaissance woman in the truest sense of the word . // Her name is Maya Angelou. // When at home in her primary residence in Winston-Salem , Maya Angelou often sits at a table strategically placed in a nook midway between her open kitchen and formal dining and living rooms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shelves in easy reach . From her seat at the table Maya can easily turn to check on the activity in her kitchen , reminding her housekeeper to stir a pot or instructing her on how to season a dish . It 's where she reads correspondence , handles many of her business affairs , often chats with friends and family and shares in formal meals . She always keeps a deck of cards close for the many games of solitaire-played to occupy her " Little Mind " and free up her " big mind . " There are always books around-her own and those of others-to be read or signed , shared or referenced , and yellow legal pads , personalized stationery , and pens close at hand . Among the books there are three well-thumbed constants : a thesaurus , a dictionary , and a Bible . A beautifully wrought ceramic angel with a beaming smile , a gift from her son Guy , stands sentinel . // Her table sits close to a multi-windowed wall offering a clear view of the many tall trees , the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the window photographs of her biological and chosen family cluster , smiling faces and group shots , in varying life stages . But her chair faces the nook 's narrow , rouge- red wall , a space she has reserved to honor and remember three of her ancestors . Their photographs quietly dominate the space . To the left there is her paternal grandmother , Annie Henderson , a study in serenity ; to the right her mother , Vivian Baxter , her vivacious spirit shining through ; and below , the solemn , unflinching gaze of her paternal great-grandmother , Kentucky Shannon : three women , all iron-willed , powerful spirits , who in their time dared to stand their ground and claim their lives . Maya Angelou never forgets the people who gave her life , the bloodline she shares , the spiritual legacy she carries . // Her great-grandmother had been born into slavery . When freedom came she claimed her independence by choosing to rename herself Kentucky Shannon . Generations later her great-granddaughter would chose to rename herself when setting her face to the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on April 4 , 1928 , her parents , Bailey Johnson and Vivian Baxter Johnson , named her Marguerite . She was their second child . A son , whom they named Bailey after his father , had been born a year earlier . // Her father , Bailey Johnson , was a son of the rural South , one among the legions of Black migrants drawn north to escape the South 's blatant , violent oppression and in search of a better life . Her mother , born and raised in St. Louis , was every inch an urban woman . She , one of two daughters surrounded by four brothers , was smart and sassy , sophisticated and daring . Nothing and no one ever seemed to intimidate her . Vivian Baxter was a woman ahead of her time . Her father was the younger of two sons . He was big and handsome and also a bit of a cynic , whose mannered speech and personal style reflected his desire to distance himself from his rural southern roots . Vivian and Bailey 's daughter would inherit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strong independent streaks . // When Marguerite was still a babe in arms the young family packed their bags and headed west . Her parents must have dazzled each other when they met and married in St. Louis , but their tumultuous union imploded in California . Perhaps the qualities that drew them to each other also tore them apart . After the marriage collapsed , the three-year-old Marguerite and her brother , Bailey , were sent to Stamps , Arkansas , to live with their paternal grandmother . // They put me and my brother on a train , without any companionship , without any adult , put tags on our arms , and said , " This child should be delivered to Miss Annie Henderson in Stamps , Ark. " ... // For years I thought what they 'd done was a terrible thing , but then I found out that Bailey and I were just part of a legion of black children whose parents had taken them out of the South thinking that things would be better for them . Unfortunately that was n't always so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandparents , while the parents scuffled and sweated trying to make a better life ... // - As told to Marcia Ann Gillespie // Stamps was a small rural community , two communities really , one Black the other White , warily coinciding under the toxic strictures of segregation . The Black folks in Stamps were tight-knit ; they all knew each other . They shared memories , history , and often blood . They had few worldly possessions and struggled to make do , but they were sustained by a thriving folk culture , a rich spiritual life , and a powerful , finely tuned sense of community . // Annie Henderson was an extraordinary woman . She married three times , bore two sons and single-handedly built her own business . She was a woman of substance and stature in her community , a pillar of her church , humble in her faith , and a great judge of human nature . It was in her paternal grandmother 's keeping that the little Marguerite Johnson found safe harbor . So much of her wisdom and grace , her sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my earliest memories of Mamma , of my grandmother , is a glimpse of a tall cinnamon-colored woman with a deep , soft voice , standing thousands of feet up in the air on nothing visible . That incredible vision was the result of what my imagination would do each time Mamma drew herself up to her full six feet , clasped her hands behind her back , looked up into the distant sky , and said " I will step out on the word of God . " - Maya Angelou , Would n't Take Nothing For My Journey Now , Random House , 1993 // Annie Henderson was the proprietor of the only general store in the Black community , no mean feat for a woman , especially a barely literate Black woman in that place and time . That store was the result of years of hard labor cooking and selling food to the cotton and sawmill workers , and a shrewd business instinct . She lived and worked there with her other son , the children 's Uncle Willie , who as a child had been badly crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Black community and a never-ending source of wonder for Maya and her brother . // It was a glorious place . I remember the wonderful smells ; the aroma of the pickle barrel , the bulging sacks of corn , the luscious , ripe fruit . You could pick up a can of snuff from North Carolina , a box of matches from Ohio , a yard of ribbon from New York . All of those places seemed terribly exotic to me . I would fantasize how people from there had actually touched those objects . It was a magnificent experience ! - Stephanie Stokes Oliver , " Maya Angelou : The Heart Of The Woman , " Essence , May 1983 // Annie Henderson was a woman with a deep faith , unflinching honesty , profound wisdom and an abiding love for her family , which informed the life lessons she sought to teach her grandchildren : " At least ten times a year my grandmother would tell me ... " Sister , if you see something you do n't like , do everything you can do , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ca n't change it , change the way you think about it . " Over the years , I learned how absolutely right she was . " ( Jann Malone , " The Passions of Maya Angelou , " Times-Dispatch , March 25 , 2007 ) // In Stamps , Marguerite Johnson developed her love of nature , absorbed the folk wisdom and culture whose roots stretched back to West Africa , embraced faith in the bosom of the Black church , and witnessed the power of the word-spoken and sung-and of music to move people to higher ground . And it was in the church that she , like so many Black children , was encouraged to stand and speak in front of the public reciting poetry or selected prose in special programs . She was a thoughtful , studious seven-year-old-taller than her age mates-when her big , talkative , " blindingly handsome " father swooped back into his children 's lives . He had come to take them to St. Louis to live with their mother . For her brother , Bailey , the move to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his mother and overjoyed to be with her again . Reconnecting with the mother she barely knew and her worldly wise maternal kin , adapting to a fast urban pace , a new school , and making new friends was a more challenging adjustment for Marguerite. // Grandmother Henderson had been her rock , a solid predictable presence . Her mother , though diminutive in size , was a powerful force , strong and decisive , a bold risk taker , with an effervescent and far more volatile personality . " To describe my mother would be to write about a hurricane in its perfect power . Or the climbing , falling colors of a rainbow . " ( Maya Angelou , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Random House , 1970 ) . // When Vivian Baxter was in a room one paid attention . But she was not the mother the little girl from Stamps had longed for : // My mother has had a more profound influence on me since I 've been an adult than she did as a child . I 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be parents of young children . They make much better parents of adults . My mother is that type . // Today , we have a much closer relationship . She knows how to be a friend , and when to stay out of my business . However , I felt very little positive influence from her as a child . I owe much more to my grandmother and my brother , whom I credit with saving my life-both my mental and spiritual life , as well as my breathing-in and breathing-out life . // - Jeffrey Elliott , " Maya Angelou Raps , " Sepia , October 1977 // In St. Louis , Marguerite got to know her maternal kin : the Baxter 's were a fierce clan . Her maternal grandmother was a politically savvy wheeler-dealer who wielded a great deal of power in the Black community . Her hardworking maternal grandfather doted on his wife and children and encouraged their independence . And people minded their p 's and q 's around Vivian and her siblings , who were all hot-tempered and dangerous when riled. // ( Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
