" The table I write on I say exists - that is , I see and feel it ; and if I were out of my study I should say it existed - meaning thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it , or that some other spirit actually does perceive it . There was an odor , that is , it was smelt ; there was a sound , that is , it was heard ; a color or figure , and it was perceived by sight or touch . That is all that I can understand by these and the like expressions . " <p> - BISHOP BERKELEY I <p> WHEN SAM TAUBENSEEL GOT fired , his friends in the Principe Organization gave him a half-secret going-away party . It was a great success . Dick Trewinning and Tom Howard brought their wives and Herman Gluck did not bring his . <p> Mildred Gluck did not care for the guest of honor . She had made quite an oration about it , with that pejorative New York lilt of hers : " Sam <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eight years now , Sam said this , Sam said that . You know what Sam said today ? He said blah blab blab blah . Who told you that joke ? Sam , who else ? And nothing to him , nothing , a lightweight . Why should I go ? " <p> " Sam has been a good friend , " replied Herman sturdily . " A good friend to Acquisitions , a good friend on the outside . " ( Acquisitions was Herman 's department . ) <p> " He 's so great , why did they fire him ? " <p> " I - I 'm not sure . Okay ? You ca n't ask , you know . " <p> As the party broke up , everyone said to Sam , " Keep in touch ! Keep in touch ! " and Sam said yep , he would keep in touch . <p> But he did not . <p> They thought perhaps he was embarrassed because he seemed to have difficulty finding a job . Hendrick ( " the Shmendrick " ; Sam had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation for various kinds of employment and sent them to the agency that Sam was signed up with , but Hendrick never heard , either from Sam or from the agency , about any referrals , and he never heard from any prospective employers . <p> Dick Trewinning , after waiting for Hendrick the Shmendrick to hear , finally wrote to Sam at the home address on file in the Personnel Office , but perhaps he had waited too long . Everything came back " Undeliverable . Not known at this address . " Sam had left no forwarding address with the Post Office . He could not have moved very far , however , because he retained the same telephone number . All his friends called him , but invariably , whether they called during the day or at night or in the early morning , they got the recording from his answering machine . It was a cheerful recording , purporting to tell them that Sam was unable to come to the phone just now but if they would leave their name and telephone number he would call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Sam were about to bounce in his front door and harvest his messages and start calling immediately . They did leave their names and telephone numbers , and he never called back . <p> Hendrick the Shmendrick caught him at home just once - apparently Sam was expecting an important call , a business call perhaps , and answered the telephone . Hendrick had no sooner uttered the words " Ah ! Sam ! It 's wonderful to hear your voice live , so to speak , " when the telephone clicked and he was cut off . <p> Naturally , after a few months Sam 's friends began to lose interest . They did not admit this to themselves . Each professed to be worried for Sam , anxious to do something for Sam , indignant at Sam 's ill-treatment by the Organization ; but between them they rarely discussed Sam , and if they thought about him at all , it was at three o'clock in the morning or some other ungodly hour . And after a few more months , it was almost as if Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to forget him was Dick Trewinning , but one morning Dick said to Mrs. Trewinning , " You know , I 'm having the damnedest aphasia . " <p> " What 's that ? What 's an aphasia ? Is it catching ? " <p> " It 's when you ca n't remember a word . You remember something but not what it 's called , or some little thing happens but you ca n't recall when it could have been . " <p> " My birthday ? That 's all right , it is n't for a month . " <p> " I know your birthday .... This is very peculiar . I 'm thinking of a person but his name is gone . It 's as if I was looking at a stranger . You remember Sam ? We went to his house that time , and he served that seafood casserole ? Suddenly I ca n't remember his last name . Sam - Sam <p> - I 've been thinking and thinking for hours . " <p> " Sam , " said his wife , not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of his last name either . Anyway , what brings him up ? You have n't heard from him in years . " <p> " Months . But he 's one of my oldest friends , and now ... I must be - I must be getting Alzheimer 's , I ca n't remember his last name . " <p> " Oh , it 'll come to you when you stop thinking about it . " But he stopped thinking about it and it did not come to him . <p> Weeks later , for no reason at all , the name " Sam " came into Dick Trewinning 's head . He remembered his aphasia , and said out loud , " Sam - , " trying to charge around his mental block . Wally McNeill happened to be nearby , and McNeill looked at Dick and said , " Who ? " <p> " Sam . I think it was Sam . Or something like that . " McNeill frowned and said , " Sam who ? " Of course , Wally had never been as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing particularly sinister about it . <p> ONE DAY , GOING through a drawer full of old souvenirs and mementos , Tom Howard came across a picture of three men standing near a fishing boat . The middle one of the three was Howard himself , holding a long fishing rod from the end of which dangled a fair-sized fish . On Tom Howard 's right stood Hendrick the Shmendrick . On Tom Howard 's left stood the third man . <p> Mrs. Howard made a practice of peering over her husband 's shoulder whenever he was going through mementos because she believed that her husband was keeping things from her . " Who are those men ? " she asked . <p> " This is me , and this one here is Hendrick Van Kleeck . " <p> " Oh yes . I met him once , " said Mrs. Howard . " And the other fellow ? " " I du n no , " said Tom . <p> Mrs. Howard sensed a certain uneasiness in his tone . " Oh , " she said with bogus heartiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret ? " <p> " Well , " said poor Tom , " he looks familiar . I - I 'm not sure .... Well , the name escapes me . Probably just some guy at the outing . " <p> " Yeah , " said his wife , boisterously but insincerely cynical , " those outings . Why do n't you take me along ever ? " <p> Herman Gluck came across a telephone number scribbled in the margin of an old magazine . " Whose number is that ? " he wondered , and called his wife over . " Here 's somebody 's number . Do you have any idea whose it is ? " <p> " Call them and find out . " <p> He did so . It was about three minutes to ten P.m. , and he felt guilty about calling at so late an hour , but he dialed the number , and received a recorded message : " This is Sam Taubenseel . Do n't hang up . I ca n't come to the phone right now , but if at the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will get back to you as soon as I can . " <p> Herman Gluck hung up the phone , puzzled . The recorded voice was unfamiliar , but there seemed to be a note of desperation in it , as if the phrases Do n't hang up and I ca n't come to the phone and if you will just leave your name were the pleas of a prisoner . I will get back to you sounded like .... <p> " Well ? " said his wife . <p> " Guy I never heard of before . What is that number doing there ? " <p> " It 's your writing , " Mildred Gluck pointed out , and drew the moral : <p> " Do n't you ever write down a name with a telephone number ? You have a bad habit of just scribbling numbers here and there and then not knowing afterward .... " <p> " I have a lot of bad habits , " retorted Herman , " but writing down the numbers of total strangers is not one of them . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Herman dialed it again . This time he got the voice of the doom operator : " Your call can not he completed .... " <p> " You wrote it down wrong , " said his wife , " that 's all . " <p> This explanation satisfied Herman Gluck , almost . He had the feeling that he was missing something . <p> Herman happened to mention this trivial episode to Hendrick the Shmendrick , by way of illustrating the truth that we are all getting older . Hendrick said , " Hm ! Sam ? Taubenseel ? I ca n't help you there , old man . Ha ha . Let 's look him up in the phone book . How do you spell ' Taubenseel ' ? " <p> " T-a-u-b-e-n ... , " said Herman , without thinking . No soap . <p> " Try T-o-w ... , " said Herman . <p> That was no better . <p> " We could try the yellow pages , " suggested Hendrick . " How are your feet ? Have you been thinking about trying a podiatrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becoming obvious , as he always did sooner or later . " Ha ha . " <p> But evidently this Sam Taubenseel , whoever or whatever he was , had dropped out of Herman 's universe , such as it was . <p> " Come on , now , it ca n't be important , " said Hendrick the Shmendrick . <p> " No , it is n't , but old age is one long pain in the ass . " <p> " Better long than short . " <p> The Organization , like every modern organization , kept files on all its former employees . Some pension problem or legal issue might arise . The paper record - known as " the paper trail " - was too bulky to keep in its entirety . After a certain point the Organization coded the salient data and stored it in the mainframe , while the original documents were bundled into transfer files and warehoused in New Jersey . <p> It happened that the name of Sam Taubenseel came up during a meeting . It figured in a lawyer 's notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been made in the way of business - and broken in the way of business . The name was not written very clearly the lawyer was a young lawyer - but he was fairly sure his note said " Sam Taubenseel . " He asked Hendrick the Shmendrick how to get in touch with this Sam Taubenseel . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Sam Taubenseel . His name is in my notes , as having witnessed the promise we allegedly made to Bergen Associates . " <p> " Why should we want to get in touch with him , then ? " <p> " We do n't per se , but we certainly do n't want Bergen Associates to get in touch with him . We ca n't embargo him if we ca n't find him . " <p> " ' Sam Taubenseel . ' I 'm not sure that ... , " said Hendrick . " Let me see that name . Have you got your original notes ? " <p> The young lawyer rooted in his briefcase . " Here . " <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hendrick . <p> " Now that you mention it , it is n't so clear , " admitted the lawyer . " It could be ' Farbenteil . " ' He had not noticed this before . <p> " I do n't know who Sam Farbenteil is either , " said Hendrick helpfully . They consulted the computer . To no one 's real surprise , it failed to turn up either a Sam Farbenteil or a Sam Taubenseel . <p> " That 's strange . The name ' Sam Farbentel ' is vaguely familiar , " said Hendrick . " Not the syllables . The rhythm , kind of . Let me ask Dick Trewinning . " <p> Dick Trewinning was not helpful . " I draw a blank , " he said , " but Herman might know . He 's retired now , but he 's still pretty sharp . Mind like a steel trap . He might just remember . " <p> Herman was down in Maryland , doing a little consulting in his retirement . " Well , " he said , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you sure you have the name right ? " <p> " It is n't terribly clear , " said Dick . " The ' r ' is clear , and the ' F ' is sort of clear . Well , we must have it wrong , that 's all . When I went to school , they taught cursive . God knows what they teach now . " <p> " Tell you what , " said Herman . " You fax me that page , and I 'll see if it calls anything to mind .... Well , " said Herman a few minutes later , " but the ' r ' is n't all that clear , and I 'm not sure about the ' a ' and the ' m ' . Yes , it could be an'r ' , but I just .. I do n't have a clue . Sorry . I know it 's important to the lawyers . How 's Francie ? " <p> One night , about four years after Sam Taubenseel got fired , a young man named Bill Perlzweig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact had never heard of it , woke up at 3:15 A.M. Twice recently he had awakened like this in the small hours with the impression - it was hardly more than that , really - of having heard a single piercing cry , like a desperate call ; it was certainly in his head , and could have been his own cry ; and yet it seemed distant , somehow . Tonight was somewhat different . He had been dreaming , a curiously vivid dream , and for all of twenty seconds after he woke up , he remembered it , and then it left him , as if it had soaked into the pillow like sweat . But this time one detail remained behind : a name , " Sam Taubenseel . " But who " Sam Taubenseel " was , or what he was doing in the dream - all of that was clean gone . <p> Bill Perlzweig was a college senior and had enough on his plate . Somebody - D. H. Lawrence or somebody - had once written that your dream is like your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that its contents are mostly rubbish of no significance , among which are one or two items of great significance which you would prefer not to keep . Bill Perlzweig dismissed the dream and went back to sleep . <p> He had a singularly good memory and in the morning he remembered the incident . <p> The next night he had a similar dream , he awoke again in the early hours of the morning , and again the name " Sam Taubenseel " stayed with him . <p> He looked up the name in the telephone book for Manhattan , and for Brooklyn , and for the Bronx , and Staten Island , and Queens . There was an S. Tauber , and a Samuel Tarnowski , and a Schmelke Trauerstein . He devoted the evening to ingenious investigations , pretending to be a bright young telemarketer from an investment counseling firm , but it was clear : none of these were his Sam Taubenseel , whoever that might be . <p> What strange filament of memory had retained this name ? he wondered . Was he blocking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead man , trying to communicate with him through some parapsychological or occult channel of the consciousness ? <p> Bill Perlzweig could not afford a psychiatrist and did not want to go to the College Health Office and be laughed at . In any case , he was reasonably certain that if his inability to remember Sam Taubenseel- the Sam Taubenseel behind the name " Sam Taubenseel " that he did remember - was due to " repression " of some painful experience , the name would not have outlived his dream . It would have vanished with all the other details when he woke up . He did believe , however , that the mind retained much more of one 's experiences than the conscious efforts of the mind could retrieve . And he had heard that hypnotism could , under certain circumstances , get at these smothered or mislaid after-images . <p> He had a friend , a psych major , who was dabbling in hypnotism , having wandered into an impressive demonstration in Carnegie Hall and having then bought several popularizations of the art . Bill Perlzweig went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the experiences at the end of this tendril of memory . <p> The would-be hypnotist tried and at length was able to record on paper an experience of Bill Perlzweig 's youth some five years before . It was not a shameful experience ; in fact , it turned out to be a rather pleasant one . <p> At that time , Bill had a summer job - it was after his junior year in high school - as a messenger or delivery boy for a job-printing company . One weekend he had been given a set of proofs to deliver to the apartment of a Mr. Sam Taubenseel in Westchester , on an emergency basis . He spent too long on the phone with his girlfriend and then had some trouble finding Mr. Taubenseel 's apartment house and was late getting there . He was petrified that Mr. Taubenseel would have called the printers ' office and reported the non-arrival of the important packet . And indeed Mr. <p> Taubenseel had already done just that , but he took one look at the sweaty , anxious young face at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reasons for being late , and he rushed to his phone and called the printers ' office again . He told them that it was all his own mistake , that he had not heard the doorbell ; the messenger had therefore gone looking for the janitor and the janitor had let the messenger boy into the apartment as far as the foyer table ; that he , Sam Taubenseel , had called to complain before looking at his own foyer table , where the package was in plain view . When Mr. Taubenseel hung up he smiled at young Bill Perlzweig and said , " Now , you 've got to back me up on this . " " Oh sir , " said Bill Perlzweig , " that was wonderful . I 'll never forget your kindness ! " " Nonsense ! " said Sam Taubenseel . " You did your best . I got.the proofs , did n't I ? " He then led Bill Perlzweig downstairs and over to Constantine 's Restaurant and treated him to a large dish of ice cream with a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way with ten uncovenanted dollars in his pocket . <p> On being recalled to normal consciousness , Bill Perlzweig said , " By God , that 's right ! That 's who it was . That was the name . Sam Taubenseel ! Did you get the address ? " <p> " Yes , " said the amateur hypnotist , " I even got the address . " And he gave it to him . <p> The following Sunday , Bill Perlzweig went up to Westchester with a three-dollar Street Map and Guide in his pocket . There was , of course , no public transportation that would get him very close to the address Westchester having progressed not at all in five years - and he got a cab at the station . When he gave the address to the driver , the driver looked at him with a deadpan expression . <p> " What 's the matter ? " asked Bill Perlzweig . <p> " Nothin ' , " answered the driver . " Nothin 's the matter . " <p> It occurred to Bill Perlzweig that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young enough to want to assure the cab driver that he was not going to a whorehouse or a drug kingpin 's headquarters or anything of that sort . <p> " None of my business , " said the taxi driver . " Anyway , I do n't know anything about that address . It 's in a funny neighborhood . Gone down . " <p> It was indeed a peculiar neighborhood , desolate ; a few of the houses were abandoned , some of them with the window openings formally sealed with rusted sheetmetal . Two buildings were burnt out . <p> The taxicab inched along the street . <p> " This must be it , " said the driver . <p> Bill Perlzweig cleared his throat . " Wait here . " Then he added , " For God 's sake , do n't leave me . " <p> " I would n't leave you , " said the taxi driver . " You ai n't paid me yet . " <p> Bill Perlzweig mounted the steps of what had once been a town house , and approached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number 319 was still legible ; but there was no sign of life . What he supposed was deja vu now occurred : he remembered the trembling relief and apprehension he had felt when he belatedly found that number five years before . <p> Bill Perlzweig stood on the front steps and looked toward the cab , then looked toward the door . He tried the handle . It turned freely but was somehow disengaged from any lock . <p> He shoved the door . It rattled but held . He looked for a doorbell and found the little round recess where the button had been . There were two wires inside the recess . Bill Perlzweig took a pencil from his pocket and pushed the corroded copper ends of the wires together . There was no spark . He moistened his little finger and thrust it into the aperture . He received no shock . He banged on the door . <p> As he went down the steps toward the cab , a boy on a skateboard swerved by . <p> " Hey , kid , " said Bill Perlzweig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curling stop . <p> " Anybody live here ? " <p> The boy looked at him as if he were crazy . " Does it look like it ? Nah ! " <p> " When did they move ? " <p> " I du n no , nobody there in my time . " The boy must have been all of eleven years old . <p> Bill Perlzweig climbed back into the cab . <p> " That house , " said the driver . " In the last stages . A house do n't get that way overnight . Got ta be ten years . Fifteen years ? Twenny years , that house is empty . " <p> " It could n't have been twenty years , " began Bill Perlzweig faintly . " I  --  " <p> " Look up there . " <p> Number 319 had long ago been broken up into apartments . The front windows had once been grand , but all except two were vacant , black , some of them cracked and reinforced with dirty adhesive tape ; one of the two exceptions was closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Palladian lintel ; and in the one the driver was pointing to , on the third floor , the glass was dusty but reflected the dying afternoon sky , so that Bill Perlzweig could not be sure of what he saw behind it . The curtains looked desiccated . They looked as if they had been slowly shredded by gravity . For some reason the word " cerements " came into his head . Actually , though , they looked like photomicrographs of brain tissue . <p> Yet behind that window , only five years before , he had met a cheerful , kind , vague , garrulous , baldheaded man who took him to a diner and asked him questions about his school work while he sat eating a vast dish of Dolly Madison vanilla ice cream drowned in chocolate sauce . <p> And as the chocolate odor , and the prattling voice , and the shine of the afternoon light on that tanned bald head came back to him , he saw something move behind the desiccated curtains : a face came very slowly into view : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timidly ; it looked down at Bill Perlzweig intently , and Bill Perlzweig could see the gleam of a hairless scalp as the face looked down at him and lit with a gradual smile . <p> Bill Perlzweig hastily pulled his head back into the cab . " Here . Thanks , " and he shoved a ten-dollar bill at the driver . " Is Constantine 's still in business ? " <p> " Closed Mondays . And the food is greasy , they use that heavy oil . " " This is Sunday . " Bill Perlzweig climbed out of the cab and marched up the steps of Number 319 . He thrust his pencil into the doorbell aperture and saw a tiny spark as he brought the wires together . <p> Author Affiliation
