Section : Militirize Space NOW ! Ceding Control of Outer Space May Be Clinton-Gore 's Most Ominous Legacy . <p> In a movie theater near you , Clint Eastwood and a retinue of aging supporting actors are struggling to prevent a Soviet-era satellite based on stolen , but obsolete , U.S. technology and armed with nuclear weapons from destroying some American city . However implausible some of the particulars of Space Cowboys might be , its main point is both valid and of the utmost importance : The United States must be able to exercise control over outer space  --  for both military and commercial reasons  --  and it is dreadfully ill-equipped to do so . <p> This is hardly a new insight . After all , Americans have been making use of the exoatmosphere since shortly after the USSR literally propelled us into the space age with its surprise launch of Sputnik , the first functioning satellite placed into orbit . For most of the following decades , the principal user of the " High Frontier " has been the U.S. military , whose satellites perform a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeting , and weather-monitoring functions . <p> In recent years , though , such satellites have ceased to provide capabilities that are " merely nice to have . " They are essential to our national security and commercial well-being . The value of such capabilities was demonstrated brilliantly in the Persian Gulf War . As a group of 43 distinguished retired generals and admirals noted in an open letter to President Clinton in January 1998 : " We can think of few challenges likely to pose a greater danger to our future security posture than that of adversaries seeking to make hostile use of space  --  or to deny us the ability to dominate that theater of operations . " <p> Space systems will also be of critical importance for any effective anti-missile defense system . For example , sensors based in space , capable of detecting ballistic missiles early in their flight and of vectoring defensive systems to destroy them , would greatly enhance the performance of terrestrial weapon systems . And space-based weapons , whether missiles or directed energy devices like lasers , can provide the means of intercepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their boost-phase . They can also cost-effectively provide truly global coverage . <p> Over the past decade , moreover , the U.S. civilian sector has become every bit as dependent upon space as is the American military , employing orbiting constellations of privately owned satellites to power revolutions in , among other industries : telecommunications ( for example , the world-wide proliferation of mobile phone systems ) ; the media ( notably , satellite-enabled , real-time distribution of information ) ; and a host of applications of the Global Positioning Satellite ( GPS ) technology for commercial and consumer users . <p> Just how dependent we are all becoming on the reliable , uninterrupted use of space was brought home to millions of Americans when , in May 1999 , a commercial satellite briefly malfunctioned , causing millions of pagers across the country suddenly to stop working . If the problem had been caused , not by an ephemeral technical glitch , but by someone deliberately attacking the satellite or its supporting infrastructure , the disruption could have been of far longer duration  --  and entailed more serious consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack were aimed at disrupting the growing reliance both the U.S. military and civilian economy are placing on space assets for communications and navigation purposes . For example , airlines and airports around the country are phasing in a decision taken in 1998 by the Federal Aviation Administration to make the extremely accurate Global Positioning Satellite system the principal technique for navigation by commercial aviation . Obviously , once that change-over is completed , in the event the GPS system is shut down , even temporarily , the consequences could range from substantial inconvenience to costly disasters entailing loss of life . <p> Unfortunately , there is growing cause for concern that use of the GPS and/or other U.S. space assets may be interrupted in the future by hostile action . Indeed , the more dependent the United States has become on space both as a theater of military operations and as an indispensable ingredient in its 21st Century economy , the more incentive we have created for potential enemies to impede or deny our use of outer space . <p> Evidence continues to mount that such prospective adversaries  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of means of doing just that . These include : Dedicated anti-satellite ( ASAT ) systems using missiles that are ground- or air-launched . The use of " direct-ascent " missile systems that could either home in on a satellite or explode a nuclear device near it . " Space mines , " satellites placed in orbit in proximity to targeted space vehicles or maneuvered towards them and then detonated at a time of the attacker 's choosing . Lasers , or other directed energy weapons , which can be used to burn out sensors that enable the spacecraft to perform its mission . <p> For example , the U.S. Army has adapted 20-year-old technology for its Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser ( MIRACL ) , which successfully disabled an American satellite during a test in 1997 . China is thought to have a similar system under development . Indeed , China may already have the capacity to damage , under specific conditions , optical sensors on satellites . If not , it could acquire that capability at any time , thanks to Russia 's willingness to sell its advanced military technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential to perform anti-satellite missions . Attacks on ground stations . To be useful , satellite data must be available on earth . Modern satellites beam such information down to facilities which , in the U.S. case , are located all over the world . Such facilities are inherently vulnerable to attack with such prosaic means as satchel charges , mortars , and truck bombs . Electronic counter-measures . The present GPS system in particular is vulnerable to electronic jamming . In February 1998 , the U.S. Air Force accidentally jammed the signal along 186 miles of the Eastern seaboard with only a five-watt transmission . The Russians are reportedly marketing a four-watt localized jamming system precisely for the purpose of countering the U.S. GPS . Electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) weapons capable of dealing a crippling blow to both " unhardened " space assets and ground-based information systems . On detonation , nuclear weapons naturally produce EMP in the form of microwaves , an invisible form of energy which renders unshielded electronic equipment useless by " frying " silicon chips , semiconductors , and other components . Unless protected against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly adding to the length of time it would take to bring affected systems back on-line . <p> A single nuclear weapon detonated 300 miles above the surface of the earth would create an EMP wave large enough to disrupt electronic equipment over much of the United States . North Korea probably has this capability , as do Russia and China . <p> For quite some time , serious military strategists have worried about the United States ' growing vulnerability to attacks on its space infrastructure . As the former commander of U.S. Air Combat Command , General John " Mike " Loh ( USAF Ret. ) , put it in January 1998 : " It is almost frightening when you realize ... how little we have allowed for the protection and the space superiority of those assets ... there is the strong possibility that a determined adversary can intrude , can jam , can , in fact , damage or destroy those space assets if they wanted to . " <p> Unfortunately , warnings like General Loh 's have largely gone unheeded by the Clinton-Gore administration . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States exercising control of space that appears rooted in an ideological attachment to the preposterous notion that space is not now  --  and must not become  --  " militarized . " This sentiment has prevailed , notwithstanding successive editions of the administration 's own annual " National Security Strategy " that have called for the U.S. to be able to assure its own access and use of outer space and , if necessary , to deny others the capacity to do so . <p> This disconnect between the Clinton-Gore rhetoric and policy governing space control has become all the more worrisome with the proliferation of what amounts to commercial spy satellites . These devices are capable of providing hostile powers with near-real-time intelligence about American forces and operations . In a future conflict , the lives and mission success of our armed forces personnel may depend upon whether the U.S. can ensure , should the need arise , that such intelligence can not reach unfriendly hands , at least temporarily . <p> As former secretary of defense and energy and director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Schlesinger has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to these kinds of capabilities , and perhaps even more important , we have lost the element of surprise . " <p> Incredible though it may seem , far from seeing to it that the United States has at its disposal assured means by which it could prevent such intelligence or other deleterious actions from occurring in space , the Clinton-Gore team has serially sabotaged even modest efforts to give the U.S. the means to exercise control over others ' use of this theater of operations . In the brief period President Clinton was able to wield his line-item veto , he used it ( explicitly or implicitly ) for policy reasons on only three occasions . All three involved defense R &D; programs that were objectionable to him because they could have given rise to space control capabilities  --  the Clementine Microsatellite Technology Demonstrator ( also known as Clementine II ) , the Army 's Kinetic-Kill Anti-Satellite Interceptor , and the Military Space Plane . <p> The folly of these vetoes  --  which were subsequently reversed , although the technologies involved continue to languish  --  was on the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NDP ) when they wrote in late 1997 : " Unrestricted use of space has become a major strategic interest of the United States . " They also made it clear that " the United States can not afford to lose the edge it now holds in military-related space operations . " <p> Ideologues , inside and outside the Clinton-Gore administration , are trying to make matters worse . They want to negotiate , among other things , multilateral arms control agreements that would ostensibly " ban " the possession and use of anti-satellite weapons and weapons in space . <p> The administration is also trying to nail down international agreement on a new Global Action Plan Against Missile Proliferation ( GAP ) . The draft GAP under negotiation explicitly calls for the United States ( and other signatories ) " to reduce national holdings of ballistic missiles and of space-launch vehicles ( SLVs ) to the maximum extent possible . " <p> Naturally , these ideas enjoy the strong support of the Russians and Chinese . They know full well that such accords would have a decidedly asymmetrical effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate the spirit or the letter of its obligations ; its ability to use , let alone control , space would be greatly diminished . For their part , Russia and China would , as usual , disregard such obligations . <p> For the same reasons , both Russia and China fervently oppose U.S. implementation of a national missile defense . It 's in their interest , as they see it , to keep the American people hostage to their nuclear arsenals . When the Clinton administration anemically protested China 's intimidation of Taiwan ( upset over Taiwan 's elections  --  the first truly free elections in 5,000 years of Chinese history  --  Red China lobbed two missiles perilously close to the island democracy ) , one Chinese Communist official asked pointedly if America would be willing to sacrifice Los Angeles to a Chinese nuclear missile for the sake of Taiwan . <p> Still , the Clinton-Gore administration has done its best to quash missile defense and has permitted discussions intended to lead to actual negotiations on a space weapons ban to get underway at the U.N . Conference on Disarmament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude a " GAP " that may make it harder to maintain critical capabilities to get into , let alone to control , outer space . <p> Even if bans on anti-satellite weapons could be verified and offer real protection to our space assets , the United States would still need to prevent others from using space against this country and its interests . As the National Defense Panel admonished : The United States should " take steps to ensure the capability to deny enemies the use of space . " <p> Doing so will require more than just steering clear of bogus arms-control agreements . The U.S. will also have to : Improve U.S. space surveillance capabilities , so as to accurately characterize threats to its satellites . Improvements would also allow us to determine whether , when they malfunction or cease to operate , it is because they have come under attack . Enhance the survivability of satellites by reducing their size and cost . Use " stealth " techniques to make spacecraft difficult to track and attack . Revive U.S. space access technology . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost-effective , reusable space-launch technologies . Instead , the Clinton-Gore administration has actively promoted Russian and Chinese efforts to dominate the space-launch market  --  a development that can have dire strategic and commercial implications . <p> These measures would do much to reverse Bill Clinton and Al Gore 's failure to provide adequately for either assured U.S. access to or control of outer space . Without that access and control , the nation 's vital military and civilian interests in space may be headed for the last round-up . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Artist 's simulation : Enemy missile launches from underground site . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : U.S. satellite spots liftoff and tracks trajectory . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : U.S. Aegis cruiser sends up intercept rocket . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Made in Red China : Hollywood bound . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : What Clinton-Gore would make impossible . <p> By Frank J.
