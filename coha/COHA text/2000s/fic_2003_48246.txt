From the Mississippi to the Styx , the river is one of literature 's more potent images . While Gary Shockley 's home in California is closer to Interstate 280 than it is to any river , he has gone to the well and brought up a winner with this haunting tale of a man on a raft . <p> PART 1 THE SUNFISH REFUSED TO die or drift away . It swam on its side close to the raft , splashing intermittently , a tendril of bright blood leeching from its gills into the muddy water . It seemed like hours ago that William had stuck the metal tip of a rope stringer down its throat and spun it until the hook came free with a flap of gizzard . After that the impulse to fish had left him , yet he kept a line in simply to be doing something . The shores remained far away , the raft at midriver , and without an oar he had no idea when the situation might change . Ahead and to his right , a heron dropped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downriver for the umpteenth time . William watched it settle in a deadwood on the left bank , then turned back to the bobber waltzing ten feet behind , a damsel fly perched on its tip . With a yawn he adjusted his straw hat against the midday Sun , slouched back in the folding leather chair , and was soon asleep . A scraping sound woke him . The air had cooled off . It was late evening , and the Sun hugged the horizon , glinting through trees . He did not relish the idea of spending the night on the river . As he swatted at a mosquito , the scrape came again , and now he saw what it was . The raft no longer drifted , nor was it in midstream . Swinging wide around a bend , it had caught a snag in close to shore . He rose quickly . This was the opportunity he had been waiting for . With care he could walk the log to shore and escape the river at last . But he hesitated , feeling a strange compulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift - An odd tapping sound broke the spell . He studied the cottonwoods and willows along the shore , thinking it a woodpecker . But it was too harsh for that , almost metallic , and seemed to come from close to the ground . Now curious , he picked up the anchor by the rope and underhanded it hard toward shore , just making it . He then stutter-stepped along the log and only got one foot wet making it to shore . After securing the anchor , he followed the tapping up the bank . At times it stopped . At times he simply misread its direction . But slowly he closed in on the source . Passing through a mix of black locust , crabapple , and sumac , he tracked it to a jumble of rocks . Among them was a cleft , a cave . His first thought was " bear . " But he saw no tracks , nor was there an animal scent . The opening was small and steep , almost vertical . Tossing several sticks in , he ducked back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug about in the vest he had found in the raft 's hold and was rewarded with a small flashlight . Shining it into the opening , he made out a limestone floor five feet below . Putting aside his hat and vest , he cautiously lowered himself within . Barely had he settled when something lunged at him with a howl . He fell backward , banging his head . To make matters worse , the flashlight winked out . Head throbbing , vision scintillating , he heard laughter . It was deep-throated and feminine , with just a touch of echo from the small cave . Then the tapping began anew . Turning the flashlight back on , he shone it about and then into a niche . A young woman crouched there , rock in hand , tapping the wall . " I frightened you , did n't I , " she said , sounding pleased . She had her ear to the wall and seemed to be listening . " Yes , you frightened me ! " He checked his scalp for blood , felt none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a weak heart ? " Which in fact he did , the result of a childhood illness . She tapped some more , not answering . She was dressed in black . Black leotards , black cape , black shoes . Even her hair was black . Yet her hands and face had a startling whiteness about them . " What are you doing down here ? " he asked , easing back against the wall , only to think better of it and step clear . He brushed at his back with the flashlight . " Conversing with the turtles , " she said , tapping some more . " They root about on the bottom and bang their shells on rocks . And I can hear them . " She pressed her ear tighter to the wall . " They talk to me . " " You understand them ? " " No . " She listened for a moment . " Not yet . They talk to me , and I talk to them . But we do n't understand each other . Eventually we will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did she really believe all this ? Or was she putting him on ? " Who are you ? " he asked . " Certainly you can guess . " She snarled , showing two white fangs . He decided to play along , at least for now . " So you 're a vampire . Wonderful . What name are you going by this century ? " She snarled again , crawling out of the niche . Then she got up and spat the fangs into her hand . " Okay , so I 'm not a vampire . You happy ? " She skulked past him and climbed out of the cave . He followed , wondering what this was all about . She had gone down the bank to stand at river 's edge . Retrieving his hat and vest , he joined her there . " How long you been on the river ? " she asked , looking at the raft . " Ever since morning . " " That 's not long . Not long at all . " He did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a lot of things he did n't know right now . " What do you know about this river ? " he asked . " Pop 's the one who knew it . He taught me some , but not much . " Shepicked the anchor up by the rope and swung it lazily back and forth . " What do you want to know about it ? " " Well , for one thing , where is it headed ? I have n't seen a bridge all day , and I never hear cars - just an occasional plane or tractor in the distance . Does n't that seem odd ? " She lengthened her grip on the anchor rope , still swinging it . " Sometimes , if it 's got something to teach you , and you 're a slow learner , it does n't go anywhere . Not for a while . " He laughed . " Well , I must be a very slow learner . " She swung the anchor overhead and underhanded it outward . " Hey ! " It hit the raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave it buoyancy . " Why did you do that ! " As he watched , the raft pinwheeled off the snag and began to drift downriver . She shrugged . The sky was stained crimson with sunset , and a light breeze lifted fine strands of her glossy black hair into it . She held a blade of grass between her teeth . He could still smell the earthy rot of the cave . It came from her . He studied her profile , how the black cape snugged the small of her back , how her long hair fell loosely to her waist . She was late teens , certainly no more than twenty . " The name 's Lana , " she said . " William . " He decided not to offer his hand . She was watching the sunfish splash lamely about in the shallows , floating awry . Her face betrayed no emotion . " You 've got a wife , and three children , " she said . " No , make that four . " Three had been correct , all grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wheeling further about , drifting steadily downstream . " My wife passed away six months ago . " " How did she die ? " " Plane crash . " It seemed easier to talk to a stranger . " She was supposed to take flight 1038 , only it was n't convenient for me to pick her up . So she changed it to 1137 . That 's the one that went down . " He felt empty , saying it . It seemed like another world . She looked upward into the sky , her hair reaching midthigh . " I 'd rather drown . " Two deer came down to the opposite bank , spotted them , and went bounding off . Lana slapped at a mosquito . " I 've got some repellent , " he said , fumbling with his vest . " No . I 'm fine . " Suddenly she turned to him . " Here . " He looked at her extended fist . " What is it ? " " It 's for you . Go ahead . Take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She dropped a large white grub into his palm . He watched it squiggle . Then he cupped it to his mouth and pretended to chew . She laughed . " You 're strange . " He tossed the grub into the water . " And what does that make you ? Why do you dress like a vampire ? " She shrugged . " I like bats . " " You like bats . " He did n't know what to make of such a statement . " My pop hooked one once . He was casting out across the river when a bat flew over . It got tangled in the line down by the hook and flopped in the water . Pop was reeling it in when a blue cat struck . Twenty-one pounds . Pop had it mounted with the bat in its mouth . He says bats are chunks of the night that get bored , so they tear themselves loose and flap about looking for something to do . Only they do n't have enough substance about themselves to do more than cause weird phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crop circles - stuff like that . " " That 's why you like bats ? " She nodded , her long hair cascading like black falls . " I like the night . " He noticed that the Sun was down and twilight was quickly settling in . Lightning bugs began to flash . " You 'd better be getting home . " " Not until morning , " she said . They were silent for a time . He studied her , puzzled by everything she said . " You really came out here to talk to the turtles ? " She pointed . She pointed at a spot on the river directly in front of them . She held that pose for a long time before speaking . " That 's where Pop died . " " On the river ? " " He drowned . Eleven years ago . " He was silent . " We were fishing . Carp , crappie , bluegill , but mostly catfish . That 's what we were after . Yellows , channels , maybe a blue or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue cat . Mom stood up and fell in . I thought she did it on purpose , it happened so fast . Pop jumped in after her . It was all a joke . They had gone for a swim . I wanted to go swimming too . But Pop , he would n't answer me . Turned out he was too busy trying to save Mom . He could n't . " " She died too ? " " Nope . She just disappeared . They pulled Pop 's body out a week later . Said the turtles probably got Mom . But that is n't so . She could hold her breath a long time . I saw her do it in the pool . She held it until she reached the ocean and then held it a good deal longer . Living in Costa Rica now . That 's where she always wanted to vacation . " Her expression was somber . She appeared dead serious . William followed her gaze out to midriver and back . " You really believe that ? " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You like games ? " He felt the back of his head . A large knot was forming . " Not the kind you play . " " This is a real game . Like pinball . " " Pinball . Is n't that a little before your generation ? " She spat out the blade of grass . " Come on . " He looked at the raft drifting onward and made a helpless gesture . " Apparently you 're the only game in town . " He followed her up a path to a van parked in the woods . It was dusty black with fancy gold hubcaps and bright amoeba-like markings on the sides . " This yours ? " he asked . It did n't seem to fit her . " I have a car , " she said . " Two of them . But I prefer this . " He climbed in next to her . " Three cars ? You must have inherited a bundle . " She started out at a crawl . He thought it was just because of the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she continued at 35 miles per hour . " Do n't like driving much , " she admitted . " Too dangerous . " " Your parents were well off ? " he pressed . " Pop was the biggest vegetable farmer in these parts . He owned over a thousand acres . In fact , he would deliver vegetables to the markets in a van like this - except his was white . Everyone respected him . He knew the land , its quirks , its needs . He was an expert hunter , trapper , and fisherman . He knew all the spots . Something of a legend , I guess . Mom , she ran a greenhouse for a time . Exotic plants . But it got flattened by a freak dust devil . That 's what Pop said anyway . Other people said it was a tornado . But she never rebuilt . I do n't know why . " She turned into a large driveway , toggled an electric gate open and closed around her passage , and headed into a large estate . The grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition . A large mansion swung into view . " All this , and all you 've got is pinball ? " he asked . " Oops . " She hit the brakes , whipped the wheel , and floored it , tearing up the lawn in turning around . She zipped back down the lane and veered off toward a woods , stopping near it . " Now what ? " he asked her . She pulled two mason jars from the glove compartment and handed him one . " We need lightning bugs . " She jumped out and ran toward a flash . " Ten of them each . " She made a dash for another one . " Better get fifteen just to be safe . " He climbed out and made several clumsy attempts at catching one . " You okay ? " she asked . He huffed , hands on knees . " Sure . Just not much for vigorous exercise . " It took them fifteen minutes to catch that many , and she had to help him with his . " Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn on the way back to the driveway . At the mansion , she ran up to the front door . " Come on . " William climbed slowly from the van and studied the mansion . " Who all lives here ? " " Me , me - " She pushed the door inward against a long ominous creak . " - and me . " He stepped up beside her . " It 's a mighty big place for just the three of you . " She glanced at him , then stepped inside . " No family . No husband . Not even a boyfriend . " " Maybe you frighten them off . " She giggled . " I think I do . " He followed her inside . A grandfather clock stood in the hallway . A chandelier hung in the dining room off to the right . Cabinets full of knickknacks stood against the walls . Even from afar William could see that everything was dusty . The smell of garbage came from the kitchen . " Come on . It 's upstairs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long living room , except that the floor was concrete . " That used to be the pool , " she said . " Mom would do fifty laps every day . She was very athletic . " He followed her up the curving staircase . The ornately carved banister appeared to be walnut . He paused suddenly , wondering what he was doing here . He looked down at the front door . " What 's the matter ? Afraid you 'll lose ? " In the upstairs hallway she led him to the second door on the right . " This is where it is . " She opened the door and turned on subdued lights . The floor was strewn with dirty clothes . She stepped in , scuffing them aside . Most were black . He followed . Then he stopped . He stared at a four-poster canopied bed . " That 's where I sleep , " she said , dashing over to jump on it . " But only in the daytime . Night is too precious to waste on sleep . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Sparkles had been stuck to it , giving the impression of a starlit night . She pulled back the black curtain . A lone coffee table occupied the far half of the room . Centered upon it was a fifty-gallon aquarium . It alone seemed free of dust in this place . Four fluorescent tubes glowed brilliantly in the top . William stepped closer , noting that the tank contained no fish nor even water , but an assortment of plants . He studied them , recognizing a few . The most identifiable were the Venus flytraps . The pitcher plants were also self-evident . He pointed to several squat plants whose leaves glistened . " What are those ? " " Various sundews . " The plants thrived , filling the aquarium . Flytraps and sundews carpeted the mossy bottom , while some pitchers rose trumpetlike to within inches of the glass lid . " Sarracenia flava , " she said , pointing to a tall yellow pitcher . " Darlingtonia californica , commonly called the cobra lily . " It was green with a closed hood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purplish . He noted that each plant had a label near its base bearing a number : ten , twenty-five , fifty , seventy-five , one hundred . " Pinball , " he said , beginning to understand . " Mark them as you put them in , " Lana said , rolling a tiny bottle of fluorescent blue paint his way . " Just a tiny dot on the tip of a wing . " She tossed him a tiny brush . " And only ten of them . I 'll catch you if you cheat . " He did as she said . She had cut twenty small access hatches in the Plexiglas sides as well as the top of the aquarium . She scampered about , opening these , stuffing in bugs , sealing them up . William did likewise . Then they sat back and watched . Some of the lightning bugs fell prey to Venus flytraps . Others entered the hoods of cobra lilies and slipped down their stems to join other decaying organic matter . Some became mired in the stickiness of various sundews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flytraps were worth a hundred points , which was the maximum . The cobra lilies , seventy-five . Other pitcher plants ranged from twenty-five to sixty points . The sundews were ten to fifty . " Why are the sundews worth fewer points ? " he asked . " Because the bugs die fastest in them , " she explained . He nodded , puzzled that so demented a scoring scheme should make sense to him . " In the cobra lily , they sometimes live for days , " she said . " A flytrap , it 's hard to say , but once it catches something , it wo n't open again for a week . And if it misses , it still takes hours to reopen . So I make them a hundred . " She jumped up , went over and shut off the lights . Then she carefully tiptoed back . " Notice anything ? " " What do you mean ? " " Look at the plants . " Then he saw . Several of the plants flashed , and others glowed . The flytraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said . As he focused on the glowing lights , his perspective shifted . Suddenly he was viewing a city from a great height . Sometimes he wondered what it had been like for his wife . Most likely she was huddled in her seat leaning forward in crash position for the good it would do her . But in his dreams she had a clear view of the ground rising to meet her , of El Paso with its thousands of lights growing immense all at once . " What 's the matter ? " " I have ... dreams , like this . Sometimes . " " Dreams are good . " He snapped out of it . Lana was on all fours , pressing her face to the glass . " Is n't it eerie ? " she repeated . Her body was catlike . She crouched close by him , only inches away . " Truly . " He studied her face and hands . They seemed to glow as well . Two hours later , using a black light , they identified their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win ! " she shouted . " I win ! " She leapt upon the bed , bouncing and bouncing and then falling limply into an unladylike sprawl . " I won . " He stood there , unable to take his eyes off of her . " Too bad you did n't win , " she said , " ' cause then I 'd have to do something for you . " Considering her inviting sprawl , he wondered at her meaning . Was she some sort of demented siren ? But no , she was little more than a child , and this had been simply that , a game . She rolled off the far side of the bed and began to strut about the room , kicking her dirty clothes about . " But I won . " Her eyes flashed . " And now you have to do something for me . " " Pray tell . " " You 'll help me . I 'm hardly strong enough , but with your help I can do it . " " Do what ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He heard her footsteps down the stairs . " Hey . Hey , wait up ! " He caught up with her outside and followed her to a shed . " We need two shovels , " she said . He was puffing again . " What for ? " " You 're going to help me dig something up . " " What ? " " My pop . " " Lana . " When she ignored him , he grabbed her by the shoulders and spun her about . " Lana ! " She thrust a shovel into his hands . He looked at it and found himself asking , " Your pop ? " " Yep . " She walked over to the van , tossed the two shovels recklessly in the back , and climbed in . " Come on . " " Your pop ? " he asked again . After twenty minutes driving down the dirt road , never topping thirty-five , she parked the van beneath a large oak , and they walked to what she claimed was a graveyard . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where she chose to start digging was entirely unmarked . William crouched before a crooked stone . It was ancient , the engraving too worn away to decipher . Lana had begun to dig , and she scolded him for not keeping the flashlight on her work . Aiming it back her way , he continued to look about . This went beyond weird . This was crazy . What if they were caught ? This was graverobbing . Then again , he still questioned whether this was really a cemetery . The smell of fresh-turned earth filled his lungs . It was her smell . She had removed her black cape , under which she wore black leotards . He watched her small breasts buck against the thin fabric as she kicked the shovel in . " You 're supposed to be helping , " she said , stopping to wipe her brow . " I 'm no grave robber . " " That 's the last time you play with me . " She went back to digging . " Besides , " he said . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There 's no marker . " " He did n't want a marker . " He played the light along her black leotards , then angled it away , realizing he was watching the tightening of her buttocks as she kicked the shovel in . At last he climbed to his feet and came forward . " This is crazy . You know that ? " As he began to dig , he felt like a fool and a criminal combined . " Why do you want to dig him up ? " he asked . " To see if he 's turned into a fish . " " Oh . " He continued to dig . Her craziness was infectious . Ludicrous as it all was , he found himself getting caught up in it . A blinding light interrupted his latest thrust . " Hey ! You hold it right there . " It was a watchman . Before he could react , Lana scooped up handfuls of dirt and flung them into the watchman 's face . " Come on ! " she shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in worse shape than he was . " Climb in , quick ! " Lana had already begun to drive off when he threw himself into the van . As they sped off , Lana was frightened . " That was almost it , was n't it ? " she said . " We almost got caught . What 's the punishment for graverobbing ? Would we have ended up in prison ? God , that was close . " But as she continued to drive , she grew angry . " Stupid watchman . What 's a watchman doing out there anyhow ? We should have knocked him out . That 's what we should have done . We almost had Pop . Damn that watchman ! " Then her anger gave way to amusement , and she laughed at how William had run , and how she had almost driven off without him . " It was the shovel , " she said . " That 's the only reason I waited for you . " By the time they reached the mansion , she had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignition off . He climbed out and waited . She remained sitting at the wheel . " Lana ? " She sat there , unmoving . He walked around the van and opened her door . He nudged her . She was catatonic . He tried repeatedly to wake her . Then , as gently as he could , he slid his arms under and around her and hefted her up , finding her heavier than he had hoped . But somehow he managed to carry her to the front door , which she had left unlocked , and then up the stairs to her room . Dumping her on the four-poster bed , he collapsed in a nearby armchair to wheeze and grip his chest . He had n't thought to bring his pills . He did n't think he would need them . Now he had the ugly vision of police swarming the bedroom , the coroner speculating , rumors flying - Forcing aside such nonsense , he turned his attention back to Lana . With an effort he rose and went to her . " Lana ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lana , can you hear me ? " He gripped her chalky hand . " Pop ? " she said . " Pop ? " " It 's William , " he said . He stayed until she was sound asleep . For a time he considered spending the night on the sofa downstairs . But the place bothered him . He was n't entirely certain she had told the truth about living alone . And what would it look like if other family members showed up to find him sleeping here ? At last he left , careful to lock the door after him . Walking down the long lane under a full Moon , he puzzled at why it did not lead to any major road , just the dirt one that they had followed up from the river , that they had followed to the graveyard . Then , to his surprise , he saw the river . It was n't far from the mansion at all . Having nowhere else to go , he headed for it . Reaching the bank , he saw something drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be ? He had watched it go downriver . Nonetheless , here it was , soon to drift by . Wading in up to his knees , he managed to throw himself onto its deck . There he lay , staring up at the stars , reviewing the day 's events , trying to make sense of it all . The splash was all too familiar . Peering over the edge , he saw framed in the Moon 's reflection the sunfish floating on its side , blood still trailing from its gills . He drew back quickly , sickened , then retreated further to the folding leather chair , where he sat down , exhausted , and drifted off to sleep . PART II He slept fitfully throughout the night , ever wakened by little sounds or the bite of a mosquito . Dawn found him tired and irritable , hungry too . As he banged around in the storage compartment , the heron took flight once more , advancing further downstream . He found a propane cooker , which inspired him to try fishing again . Baiting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a racoon chittered . Bluejays dipped out of trees to play tag low over the water . A breeze sprang up , driving cottonwood fluffs on a patch of still water back into the air . Two tiger swallowtails flitted past . A deerfly buzzed relentlessly about his hat . He drifted . Edging around a bend , he spotted the barest island up ahead . The heron stood on it . He sat very still , wondering how close he could get before it took flight . It did not . As he drifted closer , he realized it was n't the heron at all but a young girl dressed entirely in white . She stood there , unmoving , looking out across the river . She could n't have been more than ten . She wore a white bonnet and a frilly white dress and seemed unaware of his approach . " Are you stranded ? " he asked , coming abreast . She looked down at herself , then up at him . " Do you need a lift ? " As if only now realizing her predicament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait . Hey , wait ! Maybe I can get closer - " He hefted the anchor , ready to underhand it toward the island . But he held up as she continued to wade toward him . By the time she reached the raft , she was up to her waist in water . He knelt and reached down to help her , but she found the rungs of a ladder he had not known existed and climbed aboard by herself . As she stood there dripping on the deck , he realized how familiar she looked . She had the eyes and nose of Lana , though the chin was different , as was the hair . And she was only half Lana 's age . " You 'll catch your death of cold , " he said with concern . She was soaked , and there were no towels or blankets aboard . " How long you been waiting like that ? What were you up to ? " She sat down on the edge of the raft and wrung out the folds of her dress . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off her shoes . Her feet were unusually white . " Never mind , never mind . My name 's William . Yours ? " She looked at him , then down at the anchor beside her . She shifted away from it . " Raelene . " " That 's a pretty name . " " That 's what everyone says . " The sunfish splashed next to the raft . He glimpsed it swimming akilter along the surface , cutting wide arcs . It bumped the raft , cut another arc , bumped again . Raelene watched it like one might a fireplace . " What you using for bait ? " she asked . " Worms . " " Got any minnows ? " " I do n't know . " " You do n't know what bait you got ? " " I do n't know much of anything . " She got up and walked over to the storage hold . " I know one thing . You stole this raft . " " Oh ? " Opening the trapdoor , she reached down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Closing it , she grabbed up his rod and reeled in his line . " You got ta fish deeper , " she said , looking at the bobber position . " Or you 'll just keep gettin " sunfish like that . Go down five or six feet for the blues and channels . " Course , you 'll get snags , too , and bullheads and carp , but that 's just the river , no way around it . " He watched as she adjusted the bobber , put on a fresh worm , and cast out . " I did n't steal it , " he said . She let out some line , then clicked the bail and put the pole in the fork . " I saw it and was curious , " he said . " It looked abandoned . When I stepped aboard , it just unmoored itself . " " Where 'd you find it ? " " Now , that 's a good question . I do n't know the region very well . But I was standing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Tattler 's Bridge . " " Could n't tell you . Like I said , I do n't know the region . " " No one goes there anymore . Were you going to jump ? " He looked at her , startled . " You ask a lot of questions . " He went over and sat down . He watched a muskrat cutting a V-wake to shore . " I could be asking you a lot of questions , you know . " " It just unmoored itself . " He was n't certain whether he was amused by her interrogation or losing patience . " Like I said , I stepped aboard and suddenly it was adrift . " " Why did n't you just row back to shore ? " He laughed . " No oars . Imagine that . " " You could 've swum back to shore . " " I do n't swim . Now , is n't it about my turn ? What are you doing out here alone ? Are you a runaway ? " She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really . " He slapped his thighs . " Well , seems we 're headed in the right direction then . Take the chair , Cap'n . " He rose , but when she made no move for it , he settled back . He watched as she tidied things up . She kept dripping . It occurred to him even her bonnet seemed wet . " You should n't leave the bait out in the Sun , " she said . " I should know better , " he grumbled , watching her put things back in the hold . " Your parents raised you well . It shows . " She now worked at the anchor rope . Untying it from the corner of the raft , she pushed the rope and then the anchor over the side . He stared in disbelief . " Did you just do what I think you did ? " She ignored him . " You just threw away our anchor ! " " I do n't much care for anchors . " " Well , that 's all well and good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not yours either . " " Yeah , yeah . " He leaned back with a sigh . " Well , looks like we 're on the express now , no stops between here and - " He did n't finish . " You 're from the city , are n't ya . " " It shows , does it ? Well , I 'm thinking of going country . " " All city folks say that . " " I mean it . " " When will you go back ? " she asked . " I just got done telling you - " He caught himself , caught his own lie . " When I feel ready . " She sat down , facing downstream . " Same here . " Tugging the brim of his straw hat low over his face , he closed his eyes and chuckled . " We 're a pair . Are n't we the pair . " Some fifteen minutes later he slapped the brim up and leaned sharply forward . " That 's it , " he said , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ca n't be , unless we 're going in circles . Could we - ? " He twisted about to address Raelene , but she was n't there . He was alone on the raft . Settling back , he reviewed all that had happened with Raelene , how he had spotted her on the island , picked her up , their argument about whether he had stolen the raft , how she had tidied things up , adjusted his bobber - He snapped back to the moment , spotting a familiar snag . The raft was drifting once more toward it . He had no way of securing the raft , now that the anchor was gone . As soon as the raft made contact , he waltzed haphazardly ashore . The raft shifted uncertainly behind him , threatening to break free , threatening to stay . Not until he found the cave was he sure this was the same spot . Once more he slid down in , flashlight in hand . Crouching in the darkness , he listened . The tapping had ceased . " Lana ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full five minutes before switching on the flashlight . When he did , he leapt backward with a shout at someone only inches away . The flashlight popped loose and went out as he banged his head . He lay there , dazed . " William , " a deep feminine voice reached him . " It is you , is n't it ? " " Lana ? " He knew it had to be , but he dared not believe it . The flashlight came on in front of him , in her hand . She aimed it up at her face , producing a ghoulish countenance with two large white fangs . She laughed . It was a deeper , softer laugh than he remembered . " Still on the river , I see . " It was more statement than question . He sat up slowly , rubbing his head . " Oh , I 've become quite the drifter . It seems all I 'm able to do these days . And you . I see you 're still a creature of the night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it hurt his head . " So . What do the turtles tell you these days ? " She turned the flashlight off . A moment later he felt her slap it into his hand . He left it off . " I went to Costa Rica , " her voice reached him through the darkness . " Spent a month looking for Mom . I do n't think she 's there . I think the turtles are holding her hostage somewhere in the river . " He was thankful she could not see his expression . " Hostage ? " " She 's in the river somewhere . I 'm certain of it . " William turned on the flashlight , aiming it off to the side so as not to blind her . She was dressed much the same as last time . Black cape . Black leotards . Long black hair . " They 've made demands ? " Her hands seemed to ball into fists , but it was just the play of shadows as she shifted about . " I still do n't understand their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't figure it out . " She stepped past him and climbed up out of the cave . He waited a moment , uncertain how he wanted to handle this encounter , then followed . They stood on the bank of the river as dusk settled in . " Do you have a sister ? " he asked . " Sister ? Why do you ask ? But yes . I did have one . Little Raelene . But she was killed by a life belt . " He felt a sudden chill . " She 's dead ? " " Mom and Pop always made us wear life belts when we were near the water . We had a raft out on the river , anchored in place . It was deep there . Maybe twenty , twenty-five feet . Raelene , she liked to jump in and pull herself down the anchor rope , all the way to the bottom . Sometimes she 'd toss in pretty stones , then go down and get them . That 's where they found her , down by the anchor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the anchor , and she could n't get it undone . So she tried to climb . That 's what the coroner said . She grabbed the rope and tried to pull herself and the anchor all the way to the top . Only she did n't quite make it . " Still shaken , William tried to find something to say . " The river has not been kind to your family . " " The river does n't feel , it does n't pick and choose . It 's just water trying to get away . " Lightning bugs began to flash in the trees on the far shore . Looking aside , he saw that she had grown more angular , now very much a woman . Her hair was the same glossy black , only longer , hanging to her knees . A delicate wind caught it , filled the space behind her with it . Her paleness was startling , making him wonder if the Sun ever touched her . She shaded her eyes with a hand , as though the lightning bugs were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Saw my pop finally , " she said , chewing on a blade of grass . " He had gills . Some whiskers , too . A bit of a dorsal fin . But it 's too early . So I put him back in the ground . " He eyed her uncertainly . She looked around at him and chuckled . Why , he was n't certain . Perhaps she knew the implausibility of all that she said . As he watched her standing there in the breeze , her hips forward , shoulders back , arms half-folded , a contemplative look on her face , he realized how much he was drawn to her . It was n't just her physical charms , which were considerable . It was her mind . Yes , her mind captivated him . But it also disturbed him . For though he wanted to believe her games all playful pretense , there remained the real possibility that she was genuinely deranged . " You know something , William ? " she said , studying her fingers as she flexed them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only person I ever let into my confidence . I 'm glad I met you . The first time . And now . " She walked slowly along the bank to the left , looking very tired - tired of life . He watched her , sensing that they were parting company , never to meet again . He looked out on the river , at the spot where her father had drowned and her mother had disappeared , and he tried to imagine her mother holding her breath all this time , and how she was trapped in a cage even now somewhere on the bottom , with turtle sentinels patrolling the area , tapping the bottom rocks to communicate with each other . And he tried to imagine Lana 's father turning into a fish . " Well ? " He looked aside . She stood with her hands on her hips , looking impatient , or perhaps just impish . " Well , what ? " " The game , " she said . " We must always play the game . " He followed her through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavender , with inexplicable yellow bubbles painted on the rear half . She had become a more conservative driver , now keeping to thirty miles an hour . He tried to enjoy the scenery , but found himself increasingly impatient . As they started up the drive , he asked , " Do n't we need lightning bugs ? " Lana hit the brakes , whipped the wheel , and floored it , running over several shapeless hedges . She drove back down the lane and veered off toward the forest , just like before . But , arriving there , she just sat for a while . " What am I thinking ? " She slowly brought the van about and back to the lane and eventually to the mansion . Stepping through the front door , William stopped in amazement . Rubber bands stretched everywhere , between lamps and tabletops and across bookcases and tableleg to tableleg , from nails embedded in walls to other nails , or to the chandelier or wall pictures , across doorways and from ceiling to floor . There were thousands of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them stretched in every conceivable direction between every conceivable object . " I see you have a new hobby , " he remarked as they wended their way up the stairs . It was an obstacle course of taut rubber bands . " Oh ? " " These rubber bands , " he said . " My pop thought rubber bands were the greatest invention in the world , " she said . " Next to ice cream . He fixed boat motors with them . I saw him do it . Said if they 'd used rubber bands on that Shuttle , it would n't have blown up . " William could have done without the mention of an air disaster . They worked their way further up the stairs . " Rubber bands give the place a sense of tension , an impending feeling , " she said . " As if something is about to happen . Listen . " He stopped , heard a snap . Some time later he heard another . And then another . " They wear out after a while , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually . But they can last from minutes to years , depending . The laws of probability say they will someday break all at once . It will destroy this mansion , surely . And we 'll be buried alive . " She hugged the thought to herself , savoring it for a moment . " Would you like some ice cream ? " " No thanks . " She hesitated , as if considering whether she wanted some , then resumed the assault on the stairs . Reaching the upper floor , they headed down the hallway . This time she stopped at the first door . Smiling at him , she opened it . Inside , the walls , floor , and ceiling were covered with lightning bugs . Some flew about , and with dusk upon them they flashed . Their patterns varied . Some had the on-off , on-off signal indigenous to the area . But others flashed twice in rapid succession , stayed off for a second , then repeated . A few stayed on for fifteen seconds or more , slowly fading . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closing the door behind them . " And make hybrids . Of course , the plants do n't care . They 're all just so much food , right ? " She handed him a mason jar . " We 'll need a hundred each . " " A hundred ! " " The stakes are higher this time . " He wanted to ask her more about the stakes , but did not . The lightning bugs were easy enough to catch . They were everywhere . When he had gathered up a hundred , he followed her back out into the rubberband-choked hallway and to the next door . She opened it . " Go on inside , " she said . " I 'll be back in a minute . " He stepped inside . Rubber bands stretched everywhere , floor to ceiling to wall , between dressers , nightstand , bedposts , closet doors , even piles of clothes . He stared at the four-poster canopied bed . It was thickly strung with rubber bands , crosswise from post to post , from the canopy down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bedspread was more obscured than visible . " Here 's your ice cream . " He turned to her . She held two dishes of ice cream . Both were vanilla . He considered pointing out that he had said no , but decided to let it pass . It was a big bowl . A small spider crawled along the lip . " Whoops , " she said , seeing it . She guided it onto her hand and brushed it onto a lamp . It climbed upward . " Pop said that spiders are naturally clumsy , and that 's why they have eight legs - to compensate . He studied them a lot . " " He liked spiders ? " " The small ones . If they were smaller than a quarter , legs and all , he 'd leave them alone in the house . But bigger than that , he 'd squash them . Me , I do n't mind them up to a silver dollar . But that 's my limit . " She moved over to the bed , set her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want to see them ? " " No . " " Come on . They wo n't bite . Well , not usually . " " I do n't like spiders . " Nonetheless she dug out a small wire cage from beneath the bed . He could see several tarantulas inside . She scooped them up , sat down against the side of the bed , tugged the straps of her leotards off her so-white shoulders , and placed a tarantula on each . " They tickle . You should try it . It tickles . " He forced himself to look . Something was wrong with them . They could hardly move . They wobbled and hobbled . With horror he realized that their legs were far too short . " They were bigger than a silver dollar , " she explained , " so I had to trim them down . " He shuddered and backed away . " Put them away . Just put them away ! " The revulsion welling up in him failed to quell an equal fascination . Feeling ever less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined her tied there , tied down with countless rubber bands , while he thrust into her , thrust and thrust like some grub because his limbs had been trimmed . He rubbed his eyes and was relieved to see her putting away the tarantulas . " See ? " she said , pulling aside the curtain that blocked off the far half of the room . " I told you I 'd improved it . " The coffee table and aquarium were gone . In their place was a glass miniature of the mansion . They could both have stood in it with room to spare , had it not been overflowing with plants . Stepping close , he admired the lush greens , reds , purples , and yellows , all set ablaze by miniature fluorescent bulbs and tubes in strategic locations . Some plants grew in hanging pots upstairs and in the attic . These were Nepenthes , she explained . Tropical vines sporting tublike pitchers . Other plants carpeted the soil medium at the bottom . In all there were forty or more hanging pots , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , fascinated by the attention to detail , the variety of plants , the ingenious lighting , all the tiny one-way access funnels for introducing the lightning bugs . But equally he felt apprehensive , wondering at the stakes . " Well ? Shall we begin ? " she asked . He shook his head . " I 'd like to study it a bit more . " " Smart , " she said . " You 're getting smarter . " She insinuated herself among the rubber bands on the bed , squeezing her way in and among them until she lay watching him , captive of elasticity . " I 'll give you fifteen minutes . " He could have used more time . She was a constant distraction . Rubber bands kept snapping , and he was aware of her watching , ever watching , from the bed . " You wo n't win , " she said . He turned and pieced together her black-shrouded body among the rubber bands . " Supposing I do ? " She taunted him with a whimsical smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " He rubbed his hands together , signaling his readiness . The game commenced . William marked his bugs and introduced them nearest the cobra lilies and other large pitcher plants . Though flytraps were worth more , they were mixed in with sundews of much lower point value . To his surprise , Lana utilized the very strategy he had rejected , dumping most of hers in low . He watched with delight as several immediately became mired in sundews . " You 're doing very well , " she conceded after fifteen minutes . " I believe you have the early lead . " He still felt he had the lead after half an hour . But the tables were beginning to turn . Her bugs were now hitting the flytraps hard . Meanwhile , his bugs were taking flight from the pitchers only to land in the sundews below . " There , you did well there , " she granted , pointing to a stout hairy pitcher . " Cephalotus follicularis . Eighty-five points . " But it was a rare high score for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lana had begun to trumpet his every small defeat . " Hail ye , Drosera tracyi , " she said as one of his succumbed to a sundew . " Hail ye , Drosera capensis . " He watched in despair as his lead dwindled . For her own scores , she had a different and irritating chant . " Sarracenia oreophila , ka-ching ! Dionaea muscipula , ka-ching ! Nepenthes hirsuta , ka-ching ! " An hour later , even though several lightning bugs continued to wander , he knew that he was beaten . Lana went over and turned off the lights . The glass model of the mansion flashed and glowed with nearly two hundred trapped lightning bugs . The vision was hypnotic . As he stared at it , William suddenly felt himself falling from a great height toward a neonlit city . He tried to shake free of the horrific vision . He tried to close his ears to the screams , the weightlessness soon to end , city lights looming up - " Concede ? " He jumped , felt the cold sweat on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer picture in his mind his wife 's face . Slowly he nodded . " You 're getting good at this , " she said , rising to turn the lights back on . " If we play again , you just might get your way . " She retreated into a walk-in closet . " But not this time . " He rose slowly , shakily . He could hear her changing clothes . " What now ? " he asked . She seemed to be struggling a bit with whatever she was putting on . " Please , not another graveyard . " " William , " she scolded , her voice straining with her efforts . " I 've matured ! " When , moments later , she stepped from the closet , he felt a serious escalation in his misgivings . She was dressed in a black skin-tight rubber suit . " Pop is n't in the ground anymore , " she said , holding out another suit for him . " I checked last month . It took me a while to locate him after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't fit , I 've got others . " After considerable more goading , he took his turn in the closet , feeling like a pervert on top of being a fool . " So , where is he ? " he dared to ask . " In this zoo , " she said . " In one of the aquariums . He 's too heavy for me to get out by myself . So that 's why you 've volunteered . " At last William waddled out , feeling ridiculous . " Lana . This is crazy . " " You played the game , " she snapped . " You lost . You knew the stakes . " Her voice softened . " It 's not far . Just down the road . " He found it hard to believe that anything - let alone a zoo - could be just down the road . Lana had made other preparations , buying an old beat-up Cadillac from a private owner , into which she had installed a huge aquarium in the back seat . As she took corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . She drove down the dirt road that seemed to go nowhere . An hour passed , and still they had not hit a main road . Occasionally in the glow of the headlights he glimpsed corn or soybeans , sometimes cattle . Once he spotted an abandoned tractor . But not once did he see a house or barn . And though telephone poles marched next to them , they never branched off , never led to a building or to lights . Nor did any spot on the horizon glow with the hint of some distant town . Then , abruptly , absurdly , they came upon a parking lot . Two other cars were present , which Lana parked well away from . " You 've got to be kidding , " he murmured , staring at the sign on the distant gate . It read , " Toledo Zoo . " They were nowhere near Toledo . Climbing out , she pulled a heavy-duty trash bag from the glove compartment and worked air into it . It was big enough to hold a person . Reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get the key ? " he asked as she worked the lock to the front gate . She did n't answer . They slipped through the shadows past the chatter of monkeys and parrots to the aquarium building . She had a key to that as well . Inside , she directed him down the rows of fish tanks to a large one in the corner . He gaped at the huge dark fish swimming about inside . Then he looked at the label . Malapterurus electricus . He sensed what it was even before he read its common name : Giant African Electric Catfish . Now he understood the rubber suits . " William , meet Pop . " He stared at the creature . It swam upside down along the surface , its belly black , its stomach white . The inscription noted that this was its normal feeding orientation . He looked for an indication of its weight but found none . " Step back , " she said . Barely had he done so when she swung a crowbar , cracking the Plexiglas . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby tanks as other fish panicked . Water squirted out , then came in a deluge , and suddenly the catfish was flopping about on the floor . " Quick ! Put him in the bag ! " It was easier said than done . But once he got the head started , he was able to nudge the rest in after it . Drawing the bag closed , he tried to heft it over his shoulder only to find it too heavy . The squirming did n't help . " Come on , come on ! " Alarms had started , and Lana was running for the door . Backstepping clumsily , he dragged it after him . Outside the gate , halfway to the car , he heard a police siren . Lana was at the car , the backdoor open , preparing the aquarium . " Hurry up ! " she hissed . He tried to speed up , but it was impossible . A squad car screeched to a halt beside him , lights flashing , and a policeman leaped out . " Hold it right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He struggled onward until the pavement slammed him in the side . " Damn you ! " Lana shouted . As he wrestled with the policeman , he saw Lana looming over them . She flashed in the squad car 's strobe , her expression dark and sinister . The crowbar in her upraised hands flashed too . But she seemed frozen , indecisive , until the crowbar fell from her grip . Then with a terrifying animal growl she grabbed hold of the bag and tugged it away . The policeman reacted swiftly , grabbing it as well . As the two engaged in a tug-o-war , William twisted aside , knocking the policeman over . " Go on ! " he shouted , lunging atop the policeman . As he fought to keep the upper hand , he saw Lana at the car , squeezing into the back seat past the aquarium , dragging the bag in after her . She climbed out the other side . " Come on ! " she shouted . But the policeman was on top again , on the verge of pinning him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she called again . The car lurched to a stop beside them . " Fuck you , William ! " she seethed . " Fuck you ! " She floored it and was gone . With an inhuman effort he twisted onto his stomach . His hand found something . It was the crowbar . He turned and swung it hard . The policeman howled , gripping his knee . And then William was up and running . He ran after taillights that gradually faded , and for an instant it seemed he was falling upward , away from a city . But leaves and twigs stung his face , he was in a woods , stumbling over roots , bouncing off saplings , barely able to see the river in time to halt on its bank . The river . Gasping for breath , feeling the dangerous pounding of his heart , he gazed out over its placid surface . The howling continued , but now it came from above , a wind in the trees ; and the squad car 's strobe had given way to lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew what it would be , and he lost little time wading in . Waist deep in muddy water , he groped desperately along its sides for the ladder that had to be there . The effort might have been too great for him had not small hands found his and a soft voice spoken words of encouragement , coaxing him upward and aboard . PART III RAELENE WAS OLDER now , perhaps fifteen . She found a change of clothes for him in the hold . While she turned her back , he squeaked out of the suffocating rubber with relief . Soon he was sprawled in the folding leather chair , sipping rain water she had collected , feeling the tension draining out of him . " You 've met my sister , " said Raelene . Did she know ? Or was it a question ? " Yes . A couple of times . " Raelene had been frying up crappie when he came aboard . It smelled delicious . She dished out a filet on a catalpa leaf and handed it to him . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filet , then ate ravenously . " She 's , uh , still working out some issues . " The sunfish splashed in the water near the raft . She watched it for a time , then went back to cooking . " Too sensitive . Lana was always too sensitive . Pop worried about her . Still does . " He gave her a sharp look . In the moonlight , her face seemed angelic . " You 're not over it either , " she said . He shifted uncomfortably . He still did n't know how to get over it . Looking up , he realized Raelene was studying him at length , her eyes incredibly moist . " Perhaps I will stay with you a while , " she said . They drifted downstream an indeterminate amount of time . He was aware of ice on the river , of spring thunderstorms , tornadoes weaving in the distance , and then the sweltering heat of long hot summer days , and it all started over again . How they survived the bitter winters , he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this place he had fallen into . His nightmares did abate , but in their place he had strange visions of the river becoming a waterfall , down which he fell in slow motion . What awaited him at the bottom , he had no way of knowing . Over this period of time , Raelene grew disproportionately older . On one particular chilly autumn day as they kissed , he noticed the deep and wizened crinkles about her eyes and how gray her hair had become . He was n't certain when exactly they had become lovers , but it had a peculiar valence . She was always damp , and cold . She tried to apologize for this , but he would not stand for it , assuring her that her touch was comforting , he had grown to enjoy it , as if she were the river itself . For he had developed a deep appreciation for the river , despite its many troublesome aspects . While at first Raelene managed the raft for him , catching minnows , baiting hooks , pulling in his catch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon he was doing it for himself . She taught him the ins and outs of the river , how to read its bends , where it was deep , where shallow , what fish lurked where , what their appetite was at any given time . " Your pop would be proud of you , " he said at one point , then wondered if he should have phrased it in the present tense . " You 've become the woman of the river . " " Pop knew much more , " she said . " Much much more . " And always the sunfish was there , flopping about on its side , making desperate little circular runs , bleeding for an eternity . " When will it die ? " he asked her . " Why wo n't it die ? " She would not attempt an answer . Occasionally a turtle would lift its head like the periscope of a miniature sub . Raelene had taught him to recognize the snappers . Several times he watched snappers approach the sunfish , only to turn away inexplicably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . As he rubbed the sleep from his eyes , something about the river gave him pause . The bend up ahead looked familiar . " This is the spot , " he said , sitting forward , listening for the tapping . Though there was none , he remained certain of it . " This is where I met your sister . " When he looked over his shoulder , he found himself once more alone . The raft barely brushed the snag this time . He made a daring leap , tottered precariously , then managed his way to the shore . Meanwhile , the raft drifted onward . Already apprehensive as he huffed up the bank , he grew more so . There was still no tapping . Was something wrong ? Had he been mistaken about this spot ? Then he stopped in his tracks . Through the weave of limbs and foliage before him , where he would have expected the cave , he saw a dark and foreboding structure . Drawing closer , he recognized it for a house . A mansion . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a big black front door edging on wilderness . The black bat-shaped knocker was cold to the touch . He gave it a sharp rap , again , and still again . Turning the knob , he found it unlocked . He shielded his eyes as brightness spilled out . Warm humid air took away his breath . Plants were everywhere , covering the floor , filling bookcases , sitting atop tables and cabinets , and hanging from the ceiling . The inner walls were of glass , as was the ceiling , and through them , clouded by condensation , he could see adjacent rooms , upper-floor rooms , all filled with plants . In one of the rooms overhead , he spotted the four-poster canopied bed . He looked about for the spot where the cave should be . Sure enough , there was a trapdoor . Lifting it , he descended a ladder into a passage that jackknifed sharply to keep out light from above . Following it , he soon stepped into the darkness of the cave . He had brought his flashlight , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though there was no sound , no evidence whatsoever that anyone was present , he sensed her crouched in that crevice before him , rock in hand , pausing in her communications with the turtles . Hoping that his eyes would soon adjust , he waited , but to no avail . Something stirred in the darkness and stepped around him . Puzzled , he rose and followed , glimpsing white feet going up the ladder . He gave her a moment before climbing after her . Once more the fluorescent lights blinded him . Shielding his eyes , he spotted her halfway up the staircase . " Lana ? " Without looking back , she motioned him to follow . Up there , in the room that had been filled with lightning bugs the last time , she dumped a bin full of lightning bugs into a large trash bag . " So , you 've come to play the game once more , " she said . She looked older and wiser . Her face was long and gaunt , haunted by the years . Yet it made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . " Lana . Ask me how I 've been . " She ignored him . " Lana ! " He grabbed her shoulders and spun her about . " Ask me how I 've been ! " She turned back to her work . " Okay , William . How have you been ? " " Well , I got away . After you sped off , I did get away . Not that you seem to care . " She brushed lightning bugs off the lip of the bin and into the trash bag . " My pop spent time in prison . Said it was good for him . Taught him patience . I never saw him give up on anything . Not ever . " She seemed to reflect on this as she closed the trash bag . He sighed , feeling his anger dissipate like so much mist . " How is Pop ? " " Fine , " she said . " He 's in the river now . I do appreciate your help getting him from the zoo . But he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She slammed the bin lid shut and stood there for a second , her knuckles white as she clutched the top of the bag . Then she swung the bag around and dropped it at his feet . " These are yours . They 're already marked and counted . Count them again if you must . " She began to fill a second trash bag from another bin . He hefted the bag , testing its weight . " How many are we talking here ? " " Five thousand . " " Five thousand ! " He felt suddenly afraid . Of her . Of the game . " Just what are the stakes this time ? " " You know I do n't talk stakes until afterward . It would spoil the game . " " To hell with suspense . " She studied him for a moment . " Pop is having trouble getting downstream . There are dams in the way . They have to be ... removed . " William dropped the bag and walked over to the doorway . He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting totally out of hand . Do n't you understand how impossible it is for your mother to have held her breath all this time , or for your father to have turned into a catfish ? Not just any old catfish , either . No , this one 's a giant African electric catfish ! Lana , have you seen your pop since you put him in the river ? " She was silent . " That catfish is native to the Nile ! Have you ever heard of the Nile freezing over ? " " I 'll blow the dams up myself . " He studied her carefully , then came back to grab up his bag . " With this many , how do we count the points ? " " I 'll know who 's won , " she said . He gave her a suspicious look . " I - " She lifted her hands in a helpless gesture , unable to explain it . " I 'll know . Go on , now . Look around . I 'll give you fifteen minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed at the wide variety of carnivorous plants . He heard occasional jets of mist , felt moisture settle on him like the softest silk . The collection of Nepenthes was cosmopolitan . Their vines hung everywhere , ending in colorful pitchers , some tub-like , others trumpetlike . He studied them and the other plants , getting a feel for their organization , and after fifteen minutes he returned to find Lana waiting for him . " Seen enough ? " she asked . " Impressive , " he said . " You 've probably got one of the best collections in the world . " The compliment did not affect her . She pointed to his bag . " You 've got five minutes to scatter them . That 's not a lot of time , so do n't get too picky . " Hefting her bag , she trotted off . He dumped most of his down along the edges of the floor , close to flytraps and sundews , hoping they would choose the former . Some of them he dumped upstairs on the walls , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure . He just did it . When he was done , he retired to Lana 's room , where she lay facedown on the bed . He sat down in a rocking chair , where he held his curiosity in check for a full hour . " Lana ? What happened to the old place ? " " Destroyed by the laws of probability , " she said into the pillow , emphasizing each syllable . She turned over and stared at the ceiling . " It was late last year . All those rubber bands broke at once , just like I said they might . The whole place came apart like a house of cards . Even lost the van . So I rebuilt here . " He rocked for a moment , looking about . " This must be more convenient for you . You can hold communion with the turtles any time you want . " She stared at the ceiling and said nothing . " Have you learned their language yet ? " She looked sharply at him , appearing angry . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow . He let her be after that . He grew sleepy . He dozed . Eventually he fell into a deep sleep , and he dreamed . He was coming to meet Lana again . Only this time he arrived early . He had brought bear traps with him , which he set throughout the cave . Then he waited . He waited in the recess where she would always listen to the turtles . At last she appeared , a shadow in the entranceway , climbing downward , stepping forward . Clack ! A shriek . Clack ! Another cry . And she fell backward . Clack ! Clack ! The cave reverberated to her screams . He stepped forward , shining his light into her pale face , noting the long gleaming fangs . " Lana , " he spoke . " This time you lose . " He pointed the flashlight at the tags on the traps , each bearing a negative number . She laughed through her tears and made a sarcastic remark . He did n't quite catch it , but he knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mallet . He positioned the stake over her heart and cocked his arm far back for the fatal blow . But a rumble had started behind him . The rocks fell aside , letting in a great rush of river water that filled the cavern to his waist . That was when he saw it . A giant catfish moving his way , the water shimmering with the lines of its electromagnetic force . He woke with a start as it brushed his stomach , then gave an even greater start , for in the darkness before him he saw the lights of a city , a city all about , as if he had already hit it and was now absorbed into its asphalt , its steel , its neon . Only then did he spot the bedposts nearby . Lana had sat up and was studying him . She had apparently turned out the lights . Through translucent plant membranes everywhere , lightning bugs flashed and glowed . " Pop always liked lightning bugs , " she said , looking at one that crawled across her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She held the lightning bug up in front of her face . sweat from his forehead . " Pop believed in God , then ? " " I do n't think so . I think he was just speaking figuratively . He did that a lot . " The lightning bug took flight . She watched it land on a Nepenthes overhead . " You were having a nightmare , were n't you . " " Just a dream . " She seemed peeved by his reluctance to open up . After a moment she got up and walked out . He found her down by the river . The lightning bugs should have ceased their activity by now , but they still flashed in the trees all about , the river reflecting it all . Synapses in the brain of God . He wondered if she had released mutant varieties into the wilds that would flash all night . She stood there at the edge of the water , chewing on a blade of grass , her white face and hands seeming brighter than the lightning bugs themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " After a pause , she spit out the blade of grass . " I think maybe the turtles got my mom . " She tugged another one from the bank . " I mean , I think they ate her . She could hold her breath a long time , but not this long . " He was surprised to hear her say this . He wanted to comfort her , give her hope , but that would just feed the madness that she seemed about to overcome . " You 're winning , you know , " she said . " The river has taught you much since you were here last time . " He shrugged . " I 'm not certain I 've learned anything . " She toed the muddy water , sending gentle ripples outward . " The river teaches you , whether you think so or not . It giveth , and it can taketh away . " Suddenly she tossed her cape aside and kicked off her slippers . " Come on , William . Let 's go swimming . " Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how to swim . " " Then you just watch me . " She peeled off her leotards and kicked them off . William squinted . She shone like a giant lightning bug . " Lana . This is n't a good idea . " She lifted her arms high overhead and stretched . William had never seen anything so beautiful . He watched as she launched herself horizontally into the water . The river erupted from silence . Ripples flowed outward , distorting lightning bug reflections . Her arms swung overhead , splashing the night . He looked out past her , imagining the spot where her parents had drowned . As if cueing off his line of sight , she angled in that direction . Before long she was at the spot . She maneuvered about and looked back at him . She looked at him for an eternity , the waves damping away as she gently treaded water . " Good-bye , William , " she said . " Damn you ! " he shouted at the top of his voice , kicking off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly a ripple to mark the spot where she had been . Stumbling into the water , he hit a sharp root and fell forward . He thrashed about in a crude dog-paddle , choking on water . He had not taken off his pants ; they created a drag . But he continued to thrash and choke on water , modifying his movements slowly to increase his forward motion . After endless minutes of flailing , he arrived exhausted at the spot where he thought she had gone under . Taking several deep breaths , he ducked his head and tried to dive . It proved more difficult than he could have imagined , but he stuck with it and fought his way under . He kicked and paddled downward , groping about , determined to stay under until he found her . His lungs felt ready to burst when he bumped something . Snagging an arm , he struggled upward . He was desperate for air , but the water held him down . He felt himself passing out . And then his hand broke the surface . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on water on the inhale . He nearly lost the arm as he choked and choked . The shore seemed impossibly far away . He struggled to bring Lana 's head above water while thrashing the surface , still choking , inching toward shore . When his hand struck something , he instinctively grabbed hold . It could n't be the shore , because bis toes still had n't found bottom . He twisted about for a better view . The raft . He groped along its side until he found the rungs of the ladder . Somehow gaining a toehold , he leveraged himself up with one hand while keeping a tight grip on her wrist . He weighed a ton coming out of the water , and it took a monumental effort to roll onto the raft 's deck . Then he did something even more difficult . With all the power of his being he pulled Lana up out of the water , grabbed her about the waist , and - the raft dangerously atilt - wrenched her sprawling onto the deck beside him . Exhausted though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . He turned Lana onto her stomach and pushed hard on her back . Water poured out of her mouth . He did it again and again , not knowing if he was doing it right . He turned her onto her back and pressed on her chest . More water came out , and with it a sudden choking sound . He turned her onto her side so the water would drain out of her mouth . " Lana ? " he said . She did not answer . But she was breathing . He knelt at her side , sobbing , listening to her glorious signs of life . The river had quieted to the barest ripples spreading from the raft . Lightning bugs flashed all about . One landed on her cheek , and he left it there . " It 's okay , Lana , " he said . " Everything 's okay now . " Seeing her shiver , he grabbed up the flashlight and crawled to the hold . Lifting the trapdoor , he shone the light down and about . As he feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry her off . But something else caught his attention down there , which made him beat a hasty retreat to her side . Sprawling next to her , he tried to put out of his mind the sight of box upon box of dynamite . As he lay there , dangerously close to the edge , he heard the sunfish splashing just below . Another sound then reached him . It was a gentle popping . The river had grown still once more , but there was a sinuous wake in the distance , something moving about . Rising on an elbow , he watched it draw closer , growing ever bigger . Something about it seemed askew , and then he realized what it was . It was swimming upside down , the black belly bobbing in and out of sight , gleaming in the moonlight . Nearing the raft , it suddenly vanished . He leaned over the edge , looking for some sign of it . Instead he saw the sunfish directly below , on its side , gill leaching blood . His gaze then shifted aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently broke the surface , he recognized the big flat head , the wide mouth , the side whiskers ... " Hi , Pop , " he whispered . It lingered there for some time , looking up at him . Then it opened its mouth wide , creating a whirlpool that sucked down the sunfish , after which it sank slowly into the dark depths and was gone . Lana stirred , gave a little cry . " It 's okay , Lana , " he said , comforting her . " Everything 's going to be okay . He lay down and rested his head on Lana 's bare , luminous thigh . He heard other sounds now . A plane in the distance . A sputtering tractor . A train whistle . Cars on a road . And again he heard the catfish in the distance , sucking at the surface , making odd little sounds as if it were talking to itself , saying its own name over and over : Pop ... pop ... pop .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
