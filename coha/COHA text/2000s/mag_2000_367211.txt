Walk into George W. Bush 's office in Austin , Texas , and you ca n't miss the baseballs . Nearly 250 of them , collected since Bush was a child , fill two wooden cases along one wall . Each prize rests in its plastic cube displaying a superstar 's scrawl . In the collection are bygone greats like pitcher Sandy Koufax and today 's stars like Ken Griffey Jr . The light-blue signature of the legendary Stan Musial is barely legible on one dingy yellow ball . Most are bright white , though , including the one signed by both rival sluggers Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams . There 's a case for the totems offered by today 's most popular player . " Best of Luck in 2000 . Your friend , Mark McGwire " reads a bat and a ball from the St. Louis home-run king . <P> Bush had his religious awakening in his 40s .

In the relaxed milieu of the campaign plane , Bush can seem like any bench jockey spitting out nicknames and wisecracks .

Explaining the " magical moment " of Nolan Ryan 's 5,000th strikeout  --  an event Bush cut a vacation short to attend  --  the Governor elegizes the flashbulbs : " It looked like there were fireflies everywhere . " <P> On the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero , he names Ryan , who played for the Texas Rangers when Bush was the team 's co-owner . The toughest challenge the Governor has faced ?

He corralled investors to buy the team in 1989 , stringing together family contacts and his own relationships . Delegating much of the nuts-and-bolts work , Bush became the struggling Rangers ' public face , touring Rotary clubs and talking up the team . He avoided the skybox and sat with the fans  --  chewing sunflower seeds , husk and all .
