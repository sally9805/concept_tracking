. WHILE THE STARS ARE OUT AT THE OSCARS , IT 'S THEIR CHAUFFEURS WHO ARE PARTYING . They call it Hollywood 's biggest party . But even on Oscar night  --  just a few short yards up into the Hollywood Hills , where the searchlights from the Kodak Theatre cut into the darkening sky to play chase with the circling helicopters  --  there is a more exclusive party going on , a secret affair that few civilians will ever see . Like the swallows that return to Capistrano , the limos that flock to the Hollywood Bowl are one of nature 's greatest mysteries . Around 3 o'clock , the drivers drop their celebrity clients at the red carpet , then negotiate a maze of orange cones into the six-tiered parking lot of the world-famous Hollywood Bowl , an outdoor concert hall . Their cars are black , always black  --  white is for prom . The drivers greet one another with laughter , a sea of men in dark suits watching DVDs in their limos and playing poker at round tables . They are diverse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care about political correctness : The Italians make fun of the black guys , who give it right back ; everyone makes fun of the Russians . Nothing can kill the mood . " This is our bread-and-butter night , " they say . " This is our Christmas party . " There are 571 limos parked in perfect formation next to the covered patio where the Oscar ceremony plays on flat-screen TVs and the drivers dine on buffet pasta catered by the Bowl . The smell of spaghetti fills the chilly March night . It would be awesome if the first rule of the Limo Club was , You do not talk about Limo Club . It 's not . Driver personalities vary from salesman to creepy uncle to stoic , but everyone is willing to talk . Our guide into this elite fraternity is 10-year veteran Bill Dreschner , a gregarious part-timer who works a day job training managers for Costco . Bill is very quick to tell us that the chauffeurs ' fish tales  --  stories of the unspeakable things that happen when the partition is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of that , " he cautions . " Ninety-nine percent of it never happened . " But we hear about it anyway  --  about the actor dressed like a lobster , smoking a joint in the backseat ; about the actor who got severely coked up on his way to do an interview about getting clean ; about breast-feeding and boob jobs and another kind of job that starts with b . We start to wish we had n't asked . The Limo Club 's actual rules are simple : Never outdress the client . Treat everyone the same . What happens in the limo , stays in the limo . There is debate about whether the men are " chauffeurs " or " drivers . " To some , " chauffeur " denotes a servant in a hat ( the " old-fashioned " hat is also a bone of contention in these modern times ) . To others , " driver " sounds unprofessional . " It has to do with a work ethic , " one chauffeur muses  --  this one a rare female , a unicorn among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a crunch outside the lot . A white car has been sideswiped by a black car , and 571 limo drivers crane their necks to look . This is not where you want to have an accident , not tonight , not in front of the pros . Someone says , " Maybe that 's a sign as to what 's gon na win Best Picture . " When we look at him confused , thinking about broken things , he raises an eyebrow back . " Crash ! " Yes , it is indeed a magical night . And at around eight , as driver after driver rises to answer the PA system 's restaurant-style repetitions of " Car 2252 , your client is ready , " Bill drives us away from the emerging chaos . We pass north of the Kodak to sneak a glimpse down the hill , following the trail of cones leading to the searchlights from the other party , where the celebrity clients are waiting . For a limo driver , the client is always waiting . But ideally not for too long : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF MAJOR CEPHAS EW : I HEAR YOU 'RE THE GUY WHO ONCE MADE A $20K TIP ? CEPHAS : I DID . I TOOK A MICROSOFT EXEC TO PORTLAND , OREGON , FROM DISNEYLAND . EW : HOW LONG IS THAT ? CEPHAS : SEVENTEEN AND A HALF HOURS . EW : AND THEN HE GAVE YOU $20K ? CEPHAS : $20K . HE PUT IT ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS . I THOUGHT HE WAS KIDDING . EW : YOU 'RE A LEGEND . CEPHAS : WAIT A MINUTE . I AI N'T DEAD . Reference See also cover story on page 36 of same issue .
