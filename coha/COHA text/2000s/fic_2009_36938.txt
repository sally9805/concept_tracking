Best of Friends <p> Dahlia looked down the bar at her ex-husband , Martin Gray . She was slightly drunk , and the sight of him was messing with her high . Her disdain for the man was palpable . He was sitting there with a beautiful , caramel-skinned woman , who looked to be about a size twenty-four , Dahlia guessed , categorizing the woman by her dress size the way she did all women . <p> Dahlia felt sorry for the woman . Her ex-husband was a piece of shit . It had taken her too long to figure out his true nature and hatred for women . It certainly was n't obvious to her at first . Martin was a tall , dark-skinned , handsome man . He kept himself well-dressed and well-groomed ; a manicure and pedicure was a part of his weekly regimen . He spent money like he had it to burn . He was a catch for any woman  --  at first pass . <p> Dahlia was married to him nearly two years before she finally let the gilded lenses she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initially , he treated her like a queen , taking her out , buying her gifts and making love to her like no one else ever had . Soon after they were married , he started using her size , which he feigned reverence for , to belittle her which heightened her already keen feelings of insecurity . Still , his derogatory remarks had n't kept him from climbing on top of her every night and humping away like some wild boar . <p> Months after Dahlia and Martin divorced , she inadvertently met a woman at the Laundromat who had dated him . Dahlia overheard a bit of female bonding between four women who were folding clothes and joined the conversation . While the woman spoke of her past love , how hot and intense the courtship began , how his love had turned cold and , finally , how he began to mutilate her with his words , it dawned on Dahlia that this woman was speaking of her ex-husband . She never let on that she and the woman shared something in common . By the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ex-husband had a fetish for abusing overweight women . First luring them in with his fine clothing , perfect manners , and good looks and then , when he had them hooked , go to work on their self-esteem . She became nauseated when she heard her own tale , told in excruciating detail , through the mouth of the woman at the laundry . <p> Dahlia caught Martin 's attention and sneered at him through narrowed eyes . Noreen had only agreed to meet with Martin after he begged her relentlessly to meet him one last time at the restaurant where they first met . She enjoyed the oysters there and had nothing better to do , so she went for the free meal . She knew she wanted nothing to do with Martin . He was too bogus , the way he gushed and swooned over her . She did n't know what he was after , but she knew the difference between a man who loved big women and a man that was just full of shit . Martin was definitely full of shit . <p> Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone at the bar , tossing back chocolate Cosmos . Noreen had already finished her meal and was ready to give Martin the " brush-off . " She 'd suppressed her urge to see what he was looking at during the entire meal , and finally turned her head to see what was so interesting . <p> " Do you know her ? " <p> " Yes , " Martin sighed . " She 's my ex-wife . She took to drinking right after we divorced two years ago , and I hear she has n't been sober since . " <p> Noreen looked back over her shoulder at the woman downing her most recent Cosmopolitan and then turned back to Martin . She picked up her napkin and wiped her lips , having decided that it was time to call this meal and this relationship to an official end . <p> " Goddamn ! " Noreen said , throwing her napkin on her empty plate . " Who would think a woman could go on celebrating for that long ? " <p> Martin stared at Noreen . Noreen stared right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martin diverted his gaze first , and tried to play it off by raising his hand to call the waitress for the check . <p> Noreen decided she was n't ready to go home quite yet . She got up from the table and patted Martin on the cheek . <p> " You can go on without me , sweetheart . I 'm going to stay at the bar and get myself a drink . " Noreen turned to go . <p> The waitress arrived at the table and looked from Noreen to Martin sensing that something more than she needed to know was going on . <p> " Leave her a big tip , honey , maybe it 'll make up for what you 're lacking in your pants . " <p> " Fucking bitch , " Martin said just loud enough for Noreen to hear . <p> Noreen turned back to Martin with a smile on her face and in her most sugary voice responded , " Oh , what a coincidence , I was just thinking the same thing about you . " Noreen left the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martin was leaving the restaurant . His ex-wife and ex-girlfriend were sitting seven feet from each other , and he could smell the hatred oozing from their pores . He was determined to walk past them without turning his head to look in their direction . He did n't like a lot of negative attention drawn to him . He had a reputation to uphold in the community and did n't need it tarnished . Harlem was his natural hunting ground . The selection of big beautiful women of color was plentiful and he did n't need anyone fucking that up . <p> Both of the women knew his style and neither of them was willing to give him a pass . He was walking with his head up too high and full of himself . As it worked out , when he reached an equal point between the two women , they had the same idea . Both tossed the remnants of their drinks on him as if they had choreographed their movements and synchronized their watches . <p> Martin was embarrassed into paralysis as he stood between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely stunned . He quickly composed himself and continued on his way without so much as a glare over his shoulder . <p> That was how Noreen and Dahlia met . They were two women , despising the same man , and out for a good night on the town . The kindred spirits became fast friends . They were both smart , professional , no-nonsense women . They shared other noteworthy physical characteristics that made them sistas , three times over . They were big , black , and beautiful. 2008 by David Rivera , Jr . <br> Continues ...
