<p> Two investigators fired after they found evidence of theft and mismanagement at one of the nation 's most sensitive nuclear weapons labs charged Monday that the University of California is concealing the extent of financial problems at the Los Alamos National Laboratory . <p> The account of financial improprieties at Los Alamos , given by the university 's own investigators , emerged as UC declared it has accounted for almost all of the nearly $4 million in lost or stolen property at the nuclear weapons lab , which is managed by the university for the U.S. Department of Energy . The university insisted it has been swift and decisive in responding to the scandal . <p> But the two investigators said the university still is engaged in a coordinated coverup of theft and abysmal accounting that involves far more money and goes far deeper than UC has acknowledged . <p> Even some UC supporters said that if evidence of a coverup emerges , the university could lose its historic contract for managing the nuclear weapons lab at Los Alamos , in New Mexico , a facility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is incomprehensible that you could ( account for ) as much as they say , with everything that I know is out there , " said Glenn Walp , a former Pennsylvania State Police commissioner and the leader of the Los Alamos lab 's Office of Security Inquiries until he was fired in November . <p> A GAME OF COVERUP ? <p> " It 's my opinion that they 're still in that game of trying to cover up . They do n't know . They just do n't know , " Walp said . <p> Allegations of credit card abuse , missing or stolen equipment and mismanagement at Los Alamos surfaced publicly in late November when lab officials fired Walp and Steven Doran , another former police officer hired by the university to bring better security and oversight to the labs . <p> The firings led the Energy Department and the House Energy and Commerce Committee to start independent reviews and led to the resignations and transfers of several top officials at Los Alamos . <p> UC CONTRACT THREATENED <p> Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham warned UC President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage Los Alamos . UC also manages Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under its contract with the Energy Department . <p> Los Alamos , Livermore and a third lab , the Sandia National Laboratory , designed and engineered the nuclear arsenal , and now their mission is ensuring the stockpile 's reliability and safety . Lawrence Berkeley is an energy research center and is also owned by the Department of Energy . <p> UC 's Board of Regents is expected to hear this week from Atkinson and others about the problems at Los Alamos and the administration 's response . <p> The university said in a progress report  --  dated Friday  --  that its auditors have reconciled all but $120,000 of $3.8 million in questionable purchases and other transactions that were identified by accountants last year . But in response to questions , a spokesman for the university said Monday that auditors have added $500,000 , bringing the problem transactions up to $620,000  --  and that figure could still grow . <p> QUESTIONABLE TRANSACTIONS <p> The university has acknowledged other questionable transactions or missing property as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The transactions include those by two officials who , over a period of years , ordered what Walp said were tens of thousands of dollars in camping gear , expensive knives , electronic goods , plumbing fixtures , remote-controlled airplanes and other items for their personal use . <p> Another lab employee tried to charge a $20,000 Ford Mustang and $10,000 worth of spare parts on a lab credit card . The university said that the Mustang purchase was halted before it went through and that the United States attorney 's office in Albuquerque has investigated and decided not to prosecute the person involved . <p> But Norman Cairns , a spokesman for the U.S. attorney , refused to confirm that there has been any decision not to prosecute . <p> The university also identified 355 computers as missing , but insisted none of the computers contained classified information . <p> The problems , the university said in its report , have only redoubled its resolve " to maintain an outstanding reputation in the performance of all aspects of laboratory management . " <p> The university has been struggling to quell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deputy director of the lab and promising wholesale changes in the way it manages Los Alamos . <p> But the problems have continued to grow more threatening because of concerns in Washington over the appearance of both lax management and a possible coverup . <p> Despite occasional dissent among faculty members at the university 's campuses , UC is proud of having managed the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore . The university insists that it gets little financial gain under its management contract and that it has received excellent performance scores from the Energy Department . <p> In return for managing the weapons labs and Lawrence Berkeley , UC is reimbursed for its expenses and can receive as much as $17 million a year in performance bonuses . <p> SURVIVOR OF SCANDALS <p> UC management of the labs has survived periodic scandals over the years involving environmental problems and the security of nuclear secrets at the labs . In fact , the Energy Department renewed the contract in January 2001 , and in October quietly gave the labs what amounted to a clean bill of health after the latest problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho Lee case . <p> But several people in Washington said UC could lose its contract if evidence emerges that the university fired Walp and Doran in an effort to cover up wrongdoing . <p> The university said in its progress report that it still is investigating the firings . Walp said he and his attorney are scheduled to meet university officials Friday for the first time . <p> A lab official said at the time that Walp and Doran were dismissed because they had lost the confidence of other officials at Los Alamos they had to work with . <p> Walp said that within a month of having been hired last January  --  a hiring that was part of the effort to toughen internal controls after the last scandal  --  he began to hear about rampant theft and quickly collected evidence of problems . But once senior officials began to sense that the information might become public , threatening the university 's contract , roadblocks were put up , he said . <p> His main concern , he said , was that the evidence suggested a culture of theft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You do n't start out by stealing a Mustang . I had just begun to scratch the surface . This was not the first adventure . " <p> Walp said he and Doran were fired when he demanded that the investigation be turned over to the FBI . <p> Doran said the real problem was what the financial irregularities represent . <p> " If they ca n't control their money , they sure ca n't control their nuclear secrets , " Doran said , although he added he has no evidence that secrets have been compromised . <p> " I looked at this , and I can tell you the accounting was so bad , there 's no way it would be humanly possible for them to find all this stuff , " he said . <p> An organization in Washington that frequently works with whistle-blowers and looks into allegations of corruption  --  the Project on Government Oversight  --  also has been investigating the weapons labs and has helped provide an attorney for Walp and Doran . Peter Stockton , a senior investigator at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem had it not fired its own investigators . <p> " They 've led a charmed life , and they 've had absolutely no real oversight , " Stockton said . But , he added , " I really do think it 's time to get somebody competent in there to manage the labs . " <p> WIDER PROBE OF UC LABS SOUGHT <p>  --  The scandal : The Department of Energy , Congress and the FBI are investigating allegations of credit-card theft , stolen and lost equipment and mismanagement at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico . <p>  --  New developments : Congress was asked Monday to widen the probe to include the two other labs the University of California manages for the Department of Energy  --  Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories . UC said it had resolved most of the allegations at Los Alamos , the nation 's premier nuclear weapons facility . <p>  --  What 's at stake : UC could lose its contract to manage the labs for the Department of Energy before the contract ends in January 2006 . <p> E-mail James Sterngold @ @
