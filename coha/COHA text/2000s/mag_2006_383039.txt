The American Civil War 's Zouave phenomenon began with the French army in Africa . // THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR , especially in its early stages , was notable for its diverse and often bizarre uniforms . New York militia units were especially likely to adopt ethnic uniforms , largely because of New York City 's already polyglot population . Examples included the 39th New York Volunteers ( Garibaldi Guards ) , many of whom were Italian-born and whose uniforms resembled those of the Bersaglieri , and the 79th New York Volunteers , mainly Scots who sported Cameron tartan kilts and trews ( trousers ) . Photograph A corporal of the 5th New York Volunteer Regiment ( Duryea 's Zouaves ) displays most of the elements of the original North African-inspired French uniform . // No units , however , were more distinctive than the Zouaves , with their outlandish North African uniforms and their almost gymnastic drill . About 50 such units existed , mainly in the Union Army of the 1860s . How did this " Zouave craze " occur , and what were its origins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Algeria ) . During operations there , native auxiliaries were recruited , many from the Zouazoua tribe , who were clothed in a uniform based on their native costume : a combination of a short , collarless bolero-style jacket heavily decorated with false pockets ( tombeax ) , a sleeveless vest ( gilet ) , voluminous red trousers ( serouel ) , a 12-foot-long sash ( ceinture ) , white canvas gaiters ( guetres ) and leather greaves ( jambeaux ) . Headgear comprised a red fez ( chechia ) with a white turban ( cheche ) . After the revolution of 1848 , when the Orleanist monarchy of Louis Philippe gave way to the Second Republic , the new French president , Louis Napoleon ( Napoleon Bonaparte 's nephew , himself later to become Emperor Napoleon III ) , reorganized the Zouaves into three regular army regiments made up of Frenchmen who retained their North African uniform . In 1855 the emperor created a Zouave regiment for the newly re-created Imperial Guard . During the Crimean War ( 1854-55 ) the Zouaves acquired a worldwide fighting reputation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Siege of Sevastopol . The seizure of the Mamelon Vert and particularly the taking of the Malakoff , the linchpin of the Russian defenses , by the 1st Regiment led personally by French commander in chief Marshal Marie Edm Patrice de MacMahon were highlights . During this war , an American observer , Captain George B. McClellan , described the Zouaves as " the finest light infantry that Europe can produce , the beau ideal of a soldier . " In Italy during the 1859 war between Piedmont/Sardinia and Austria for control of northern Italy , French Zouaves played a key role . At Magenta 10 Lgions d'Honneur and 50 Mdailles Militaires were awarded to the Zouaves of the Imperial Guard . One of the latter was awarded to a Madame Rossini , the vivandire orcantinire of the regiment , the first such award to a woman . The eagle of the 2nd Zouaves was decorated with the emperors own Lgion d'Honneur . The Zouaves went on to distinguish themselves in the French intervention in Mexico in the 1860s , the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and later in World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have figured in the American Civil War if not for the efforts of one individual : Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth , the son of an impoverished family from Mechanicsville , N.Y. , with a pipe dream of attending the U.S. Military Academy at West Point . Having moved to Illinois after failing in business , he rose to prominence in the state militia . After a brief period as a law clerk in the Springfield office of Abraham Lincoln , who became a lifelong friend , Ellsworth studied the intricacies of French light infantry drill . Returning to Chicago , he transformed a somewhat lackluster militia unit into the U.S. Zouave Cadets , which soon became known as the best-drilled militia unit in the Midwest . Using a variation of French light infantry drill and outfitted in an adaptation of the French Zouave uniform , the cadets embarked on a six-week tour , challenging militia units in the Midwest and Eastern states to drill competitions . In New York City thousands watched their displays , and Ellsworth became a national celebrity . Almost immediately Zouave companies sprang up , all clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform-the " Zou Zous " were born . The craze was such that women and children often dressed as Zouaves . A BORED ELLSWORTH greeted the outbreak of war in April 1861 as a blessed release from the study of the law . At 24 , after visiting his friend and former boss , President Lincoln , he hastened to New York City to raise a Zouave regiment for the Union . He hit upon the Manhattan Volunteer Firemen , and thus was born the llth New York Volunteer Infantry ( Ellsworth 's Zouaves , otherwise known as the Fire Zouaves ) . The regiment was clothed in a gray variation of the French Zouave uniform designed by Ellsworth himself . Departing New York for Washington on April 29 , the Fire Zouaves , described by presidential secretary John Hay as a " jolly , gay set of blackguards , " paraded down Broadway to the rapturous applause of a large crowd . Lincoln himself welcomed them . Hay 's description was borne out by their wild antics while billeted in the Capitol . On May 24 , Federal troops including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Va . seeing a Confederate flag flying from Marshall House , a local tavern , Ellsworth called out , " Boys , we must have that flag ! " then rushed upstairs and tore it down . Upon descending the stairs , he was accosted by the publican , James Jackson , who shot him dead . Jackson was then dispatched by one of Ellsworth 's men , Corporal Francis Brownell . Ellsworth became a martyr , and " Avenge Ellsworth ! " became a Northern battle cry . His death also spurred recruiting of Zouave units , notably the 5th New York Volunteers ( Ellsworth 's Avengers ) , which went on to become one of the most famous Union regiments . At the First Battle of Bull Run ( Manassas ) , the Fire Zouaves performed as most Union troops did-in the main they broke and ran . However , Company K of the 69th New York Volunteers ( the Fighting Irish ) , a regiment formed in the 1850s by Irish immigrants , with some of the Fire Zouaves , put up a stout fight , capturing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , the Memphis Argus , acclaimed them with the words " No southerner but feels that the Sixty Ninth maintained the old reputation of Irish valor . " In all , more than 50 Zouave units existed in the Union Army , ranging in size from companies to whole regiments . Most were from the Eastern states , 25 from New York alone . Some , however , came from Illinois-where Ellsworth 's original Zouave cadets were raised-Indiana , Iowa , Michigan , Minnesota , Ohio and Wisconsin . Exact numbers are hard to tally , and some Zouave units did not last long . The Zouave uniform , practical perhaps in the North African desert and mountains , did not stand up well to the rain , mud and underbrush of American terrain , and a year so into the war many Zouave units had exchanged their threadbare uniforms for the ubiquitous dark-blue sack coats , light-blue trousers and kepis or bummers caps . Some units , such as the 72nd Pennsylvania , evolved uniforms that combined elements of the Zouave uniform with standard , more practical Union Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special occasions , though some kept wearing their distinctive dress throughout the war , notably the 114th Pennsylvania ( Collis ' Zouaves ) , which was selected by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade as his Headquarters Guard . Later in the war , at least three Union regiments , the 146th New York in June 1863 , and the 140th New York and the 155th Pennsylvania in 1864 , received Zouave dress . That was done as a reward for proficiency at drill and to maintain the Zouave legacy . ZOUAVE UNITS existed in the Confederate Army to a lesser extent . Many were local companies formed as a result of the Zouave craze . Most were absorbed into state infantry regiments and soon lost their distinctive identity . Two Zouave units gained notoriety in Confederate service : the 1st Special Battalion , Louisiana Infantry ( Wheats Tigers or the Louisiana Tigers ) , and the 1st Battalion , Louisiana Zouaves . The 1st Special Battalion was raised in New Orleans by Roberdeau Wheat , a colorful soldier of fortune and Mexican War veteran . From its inception in 1861 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , rowdy behavior and poor discipline of its troops as for its fighting spirit . On at least one occasion an execution was needed to keep them in line . On July 21 , however , they held the Confederate left at First Manassas against six times their number , although Wheat was seriously wounded in the fight . The Tigers were still in the thick of it until their last great battle at Gaines ' Mill in June 1862 , when Wheat was killed . Robbed of their charismatic leader , the Tigers ' broken remnants were drafted into other units . The 1st Battalion , Louisiana ( or Confederate ) Zouaves , commonly known as Coppens ' Zouaves , was well nigh unique in the Confederate Army in the manner of its raising . In the Confederate Army all units of the " fighting arms " - cavalry , artillery and infantry-were raised under the authority of their individual states . Only specialist supporting units , such as engineers , signals , quartermasters , etc. , were raised under the authority of the central government . But George Auguste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from the Confederate adjutant general , Samuel Cooper . Like Wheat , Coppens was a colorful character , a New Orleans socialite from a noble French family and a noted duelist . His battalion was very much a family affair , with his elder brother , Baron Auguste de Coppens , serving as quartermaster , another brother as a company commander and yet another as a sergeant . The battalion was made up of some 20 percent Swiss immigrants , along with French , German , Italian , Irish and English volunteers , and a minority of native-born Americans . Several of the officers had prior service in the French army . Like Wheat 's Tigers , Coppens ' men were noted for their lack of discipline , but proved to be superb fighting men . At the Battles of Seven Pines and Gaines ' Mill they were decimated . At Second Manassas they along with the rest of the 2nd Louisiana Brigade ran out of ammunition and resorted to throwing rocks at the Blue Bellies . At Antietam the battalion was reduced to a shadow of its former self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several state militia units retained Zouave dress after April 1865 , but by the end of the century the distinctive Zouave uniform was preserved only by some veterans groups . Thus passed from the scene a group of " soldiers with attitude " who added a broad stroke of color to the canvas of American military history . <p>
