He thought she was a beggar ? Kathleen Mac David , granddaughter of the Countess of Dumleavy , stared at the coins in her hand . Indignation swept through her . A beggar ? The arrogance of the man . No , the stupidity ! <p> " I beg your par  --  " She looked up , the words died in her throat . The earl was already climbing into his carriage . <p> She watched it pull away and her annoyance faded . To be fair , and Kathleen was nothing if not fair , in the deepening shadows of the approaching night , and wrapped in the hooded cloak her grandmother had insisted she wear for luck  --  it had been passed down from grandmother to granddaughter for generations and therefore had a certain inherent power  --  perhaps it might be possible , if one were paying scant attention , to mistake a lady of quality for a beggar . And perhaps , if one incorrectly assumed a woman in an overly large , faded , well-used cloak was not a lady of quality , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a forbidding chaperone might confirm that mistaken impression . Very well then . Kathleen started toward her carriage a scant few yards from where the Earl of Norcroft 's vehicle had been parked no more than a minute ago . Perhaps the man was n't an idiot , which was rather nice to know , all things considered . <p> She instructed the driver of her carriage to return to the hotel , then climbed in and settled in the seat across from her aunt and alleged chaperone Lady Hannah Fitzgivens . If truth were told , it was often difficult to tell just who was chaperoning whom . Not that , as widows , either really needed a chaperone . Necessity aside , Hannah had insisted on accompanying Kathleen because , as she had said before they had left Scotland , it might be an interesting adventure . <p> " Well ? " Hannah raised a brow . " Did you see him ? " <p> " I did , " Kathleen said slowly . <p> " And ? " An eager note sounded in Hannah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Oh . " Hannah 's expression fell , then brightened . " Are we following him then ? " <p> " No , of course not . We 're returning to the hotel . My intention was not to accost him , you know . " " Not to accost him yet , you mean . " <p> " I do n't mean that at all . I simply wanted to get a good look at the man . " Kathleen shrugged as if that was truly all that she had intended . Of course , they both knew better . Indeed , when he had stopped before her , Kathleen had been perilously close to throwing caution to the winds and introducing herself . Even in that brief moment , there had been the hint of something inevitable about the man . Utter nonsense really and attributable to nothing more significant than her grandmother 's never-ending pronouncements and her own newfound belief in destiny and the absurd . Regardless , such a first meeting might be awkward and would be highly improper although she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But he was a British lord with a long and distinguished title and it would not do to get off on the wrong foot with him . Still , Kathleen doubted there was a right foot . She sighed and settled back in her seat . Nothing about this venture was going to be even remotely less than awkward . <p> " But I thought you had a photograph ? " <p> " An image captured in that excruciatingly long time one has to remain motionless for the camera to do its work has always struck me as being somewhat less than lifelike . Oh certainly it is exact , but it fails to capture . . . " Kathleen thought for a moment . " The humanity of a subject , if you will . The subject of a photograph might as well be an apple for all the life expressed in the resulting image . " She shook her head . " It is not at all like a living , breathing person . " <p> " And you found the living , breathing person . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acceptable ? " <p> " Yes , Aunt Hannah , I did . " More than acceptable but she was n't at all sure she wished to confess that yet . While his eyes had never met hers , even in the deepening twilight she had seen they were a rich blue and she had wondered in that instant what they would look like when he laughed . Or when he was angered . Or in the throes of passion , although that was not something it would be wise to dwell on at the moment and certainly not something she would tell her aunt . While the photograph allowed her to recognize his features anywhere , the lack of color coupled with the firm , unyielding expression that was mandatory for a photograph did not do justice to the Earl of Norcroft in the flesh . <p> His hair was not as dark as she had thought given the photograph , more a rich brown than a black . He was taller than she had expected as well , his shoulders broader , his stride determined . Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your reluctance to do so before now , you were simply waiting to see the gentleman in person before proceeding with a plan . You do need a plan , my dear . " <p> " Yes , you 've mentioned that , " Kathleen said under her breath . <p> Aunt Hannah was a firm believer in plans . She said most of the ills of the world could be laid at the foot of poor planning and claimed her first marriage to a wealthy Scottish lord was the direct result of a well-laid plan . That she had loved him with a passion that had lingered far beyond his death at a tragically young age had not been part of her plan . In the nearly quarter of a century since his demise , she had had any number of lovers but not another love . When pressed , she would say that was part of a grander plan which was not , on a divine level , especially well thought out . <p> <br> Continues ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
