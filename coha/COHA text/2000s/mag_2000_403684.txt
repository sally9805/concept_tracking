/Jan 2000 When my sister Lesley was six , she learned the truth about Santa . He had n't really left the presents under the tree that were tagged " from Santa " or eaten the cookies she 'd put out on a special plate . To everyone 's surprise , she was furious with my parents for deceiving her . When I had my own children , I thought back to my sister 's intense reaction and decided that I would tell my kids the truth , right from the start . Yes , we talked about Santa at Christmastime but I made it clear that this was just a story ; we were just pretending that St. Nick came to our home to give us presents . As they got older , I talked to my kids about how each of us could be Santa when we gave something to another person  --  and how the man in the red suit is just a symbol for this spirit of giving . It worked well for us , but I got some flak from parents who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carolann Malenfant is one such Santa devotee . A mother of four , she keeps Father Christmas real for as long as possible . " Whenever my kids would ask , I would tell them , " I still believe in Santa . You can believe whatever you want , but as far as I 'm concerned , he 's real . ' They 'd say , " Tell us the truth , " and I 'd say " That is the truth  --  I do believe in Santa . ' ' " Her eight-year-old son , Tyler , continues to keep the faith , but Malenfant knows he 's going to get wise soon . " No matter what I say , they stop believing by around age nine or ten , in a literal sense . So it 's only a very short time that you have that magic . " Anne Moniuk , the mother of two children aged seven and nine , says , " Rob and I did n't really plan what we 'd do about Santa or have a strategy . We just kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby and we took her to see Santa for the first time . " Last year , when Wendy was eight , she said to her mother , " It just ca n't be done , Mom . Santa does n't make sense  --  it would n't be possible for him to deliver all those presents . " So Moniuk admitted that Santa was , in fact , a myth . " Wendy was a little annoyed that she had been tricked all these years , " her mother says , " but was n't all that upset . " But Wendy 's younger brother , Victor , is still a believer . " Wendy fakes it a bit for Victor 's sake , but he seems to know that she does n't really believe in Santa , " Moniuk explains . " He keeps trying to convince her . He 'll say that he heard reindeer hooves on the roof Christmas Eve , or point out the gifts he 's gotten from Santa . " Moniuk says she thinks Santa is important to Victor . " He wants to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tooth fairy was n't real , and I could see how worried Victor was . He was almost in a crisis over it  --  if my parents were lying about the tooth fairy , what else could they be lying about ? " When he asked Moniuk directly , she responded with , " What do you think ? " " Since he still wanted to believe , I did n't want to shatter it , " she says . The Santa question can be complicated by other factors . I have friends who , after many months of unemployment , found themselves facing Christmas with minimal funds . It was hard to deal with a six-year-old who confidently prepared a wish list of expensive items like the ones Santa had brought in the past and reassured her parents by saying , " It 's OK , Santa will bring them . I 've been very good . " They decided to tell her the truth . Other families have children who become suspicious when they realize that Santa skips the houses of their Jewish friends . That just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age are pretty savvy about the world and how it works . They think more , question more , reason better and understand just about everthing . That 's why the jig is often up on the Santa thing right around now . For parents , this loss of innocence can be bittersweet . It 's great to have a child who 's clever enough to figure out that Santa ca n't be real the way eight-year old Wendy Moniuk did . Nevertheless , it can be pretty tough to give up that little piece of Christmas magic . For parents that is . <p>
