Should We All Be Vegetarians ? <P> " Being a vegetarian is a win-win situation . The animals win ; the environment wins ; and people win by living healthier , longer lives . " SHERRILL DURBIN Mounds , Okla . <P> Thank you for a very evenhanded , intelligent report on the trend toward vegetarian and vegan diets HEALTH , July 15 . It 's encouraging to see that , whether out of compassion for animals or a concern for their own health ( or both ) , people are starting to realize that it does n't pay to eat too far up on the food chain . Meat need n't be what is for dinner . Factory farming is barbaric and cruel . Every person who reduces the use of animals in his or her life is performing a lifesaving act . LAURIE ULRICH Huntingdon Valley , Pa . <P> Why praise food extremists like vegetarians ? Our planet offers such diversity in available foods , it seems almost rude not to better our bodies with variety . Eat your steak , and have your broccoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCHUETTPELZ Ellensburg , Wash . <P> I 'm ready to be a vegetarian , but America 's farmers , food producers , restaurants and supermarkets are not prepared to support me . It 's much easier and less expensive to get a hamburger at McDonald 's or Chinese takeout or a roast chicken from the supermarket than it is to take the time to shop for , assemble and cook a tasty , nutritious and fulfilling vegetarian meal . JEFF BRENNER New York City <P> I 've heard another term for pesco-pollo-vegetarians : beady-eyed vegetarians . Basically , they 'll eat things with beady eyes ( lobster , fish , chicken ) but not with big , sad , Bambi eyes ( cows , lambs ) . This definition sounds flaky , but a friend of mine explained it by saying he would eat only things he thought he could kill himself . He figures he can kill a fish but not a cow . That seems like a more honest and consistent rationale than some of the others I 've heard . ROD STEPHENS Boulder , Colo . <P> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have found that there is great misunderstanding about vegan principles in our society . While some vegetarians and vegans abstain from animals as a matter of health , we ethical vegans do n't want other animals to live for us , nor do we want other animals to die for us , as they do for food , clothing and wasteful scientific research . All animals live for their own sake , not for mine . JERRY FRIEDMAN Los Angeles <P> Why do some people think animals and human beings are the same ? In my opinion , a human life is worth a lot more than an animal 's . We must stop thinking of meat eaters as killers . Vegetarians also kill vegetable life . Is there any difference ? Eat vegetables and meat ; both help you to be healthy and allow you to have all the nutrients your body needs . ENRIQUE S. LORES Mexico City <P> I 'm a second-generation vegetarian . My mom is an 87-year-old vegetarian who still works out daily . All her friends who used to make fun of her diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORAN Marina del Rey , Calif . <P> While we are quite rightly opposed to the death of creatures for the purpose of feeding a gluttonous North American society , it is the method employed in the raising of animals that is equally , if not more , objectionable . In fact , for factory-farmed animals , death must be a happy release from a life of sheer misery . JUDITH SEEDHOUSE Burnaby , B.C.
