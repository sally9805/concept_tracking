<p> WHEN Celene Pena moved from Mexico to the United States and took a job at a McDonald 's , she had no idea she would one day be a successful inventor , but necessity is the mother of such things . <p> After starting her own floral business , she grew frustrated with the products on the market for transporting flower arrangements . <p> The seed of an idea for a better product came to her and would wake her in the middle of the night . <p> " Celene , go back to sleep , " her husband , Carlos Pena , an apartment maintenance man , would tell her . <p> She never let go of the concept , and with the help of a friend , Tracy Jackson - they experimented with 80 designs - she got it patented . <p> In January , Pena debuted her floral carrier , which some members of the industry are calling a vastly superior product . <p> Her will to raise money , develop and market her invention stems from her desire to take care of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invent : Creative , bold , resourceful and determined enough to juggle the project with her family life . <p> The two worlds , invention and family , bear similarities . Giving birth to a product is like having a child , Pena said . <p> Her Flora Carrier is still new , Pena said , and like an infant , " it has a lot of needs and concerns . " <p> The number of female inventors has grown dramatically in recent decades , and currently women comprise 10 to 12 percent of the local group . <p> " You just have to be creative and like to solve problems , " said Ken Roddy , president of the Houston Inventors Association , which he says is one of the largest in the nation . <p> Among the female inventors in town is C.J. Boylan , a local mother of five and grandmother of eight , who has devised a new way to wash dishes : A dishwasher that is connected to the dining table , eliminating a trip to the sink . <p> It can be beneficial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in cramped living quarters . <p> Boylan has 24 other inventions , all meant to make life easier for mothers , she said . She would not say what they are because they are not patented . <p> Her patented dishwasher is not yet on the market , unlike an invention conceived by another Houston mother whose product made its way into an upscale boutique visited by celebrities . <p> The New York Daily News spotted Sex and the City star and new mother Sarah Jessica Parker walking into a shop called The Upper Breast Side in Manhattan to purchase a hands-free pumping bra , an invention of Houstonian Gretchen Martinez Penny . <p> Before Penny 's bra entered the market , a mother had to hold the breast pump to her chest while using it . With Penny 's hands-free bra , a user can eat or work a computer while pumping milk . <p> Her Easy Expression bra is sold in more than 70 maternity shops and breast-feeding boutiques , which carry names such as The Milky Way , Simply Mama and Lactation Station . <p> The retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 . <p> People make jokes about her bra because , Penny said , " It is just a funny looking garment . It does look odd . " <p> It looks even stranger when connected to the breast pump , an electric contraption with funnels , tubes and baby bottles . <p> She came up with the idea for the bra when , as a new mother , she worked as project manager for a subsidiary of American Airlines in Dallas . <p> At work , she had to rely on a breast pump held with both hands . <p> " It was horrible , " she said . She spent 15 to 30 minutes each pumping session , several times a day . <p> At home , Penny got out her sewing supplies and designed a bra that allowed the pump to stay in place without the use of her hands . <p> A few of her colleagues who were also breast feeding asked her to make them one . <p> American Airlines became her testing ground , she said , and its lounge became " a little sorority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penny , suggested she should turn her invention into a business . <p> Experimenting with varieties of styles for her bra , " I felt like a designer , " Penny said . " It had a little bit of glamour to it . " <p> In the fall of 1997 , she hired a sewing company to make 800 hands-free bras . <p> And after moving back to Houston , Penny , who has an MBA from Rice University , founded her company , Easy Expression Products . <p> She ran ads for her bra in breast-feeding magazines and attended trade shows , and orders came in . <p> Each month the number of orders increased , and she noted , " I 'm not the smallest business in the breast-feeding world anymore . " <p> Her sons Noah , 5 , and Leo , 7 , she said , are getting to the point where they can say what their mom does for a living but " do n't know enough yet to be embarrassed by it . " <p> However , she said , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <p> Genevieve Baker was previously a local elementary school teacher , but now she is testing a pipe adhesive in saltwater to determine its shelf life , flash point and water absorption rate . <p> And she has no background in science . <p> " If you know how to read , research and work in a library , you can do almost anything , " she said . " I guess I 'm stubborn . " <p> After a divorce , she realized she needed to make more money than teaching offered . <p> Looking to start a business , she bought the rights to a pipe wrap product that she began selling to major retailers , including Home Depot . The product , Pipe Wrap , is a gauze tape that forms a cast around broken plumbing . <p> She later teamed up with local businessman David Weaver , and the two began developing a product called Splashgard , which uses Pipe Wrap and an underwater poxy adhesive to form a corrosion barrier for pipe . <p> They have a patent for Splashgard , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people in Baker 's circumstance , lacking formal training , would be intimidated by the research , " but she just goes after it . " <p> Baker , who has remarried , has two daughters from her first marriage , Sarah , 18 , and Emma , 13 . The children 's photos surround her office . <p> While she develops Splashgard , Baker continues to market Pipe Wrap . <p> Noting that her ex-husband is a drilling fluids engineer , she said he was " sure shocked " when he found out that his ex-schoolteacher-wife had a pipe product on the shelves of Home Depot . <p> Inventors such as Baker , Penny and Pena have chosen to market their products , but there is another option , noted Roddy , the Houston Inventors Association president : One can license the invention to a big company . <p> Licensing is often a smart choice because a large company has great resources , including salesmen . And in many instances the development of an invention is too expensive for an individual to undertake . <p> Retailers are often reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roddy said . It is easier to find buyers when you have a line of products . So , he suggested , team up with other people who have related inventions . <p> This summer Celene Pena and her family are making Utah their vacation destination . Salt Lake City is hosting a floral trade show , and Pena will mix work with fun . <p> She got the idea when delivering flowers for her floral business . Her arrangements often tipped over , and she could n't carry enough bouquets at a time . <p> She began thinking of a better way . Her friend and cousin through marriage , Tracy Jackson , an air traffic controller , joined forces . Her husband , Carlos , had ideas , too . <p> They came up with a square plastic container and , to hold the arrangements in place , two levels of cross-sectioned strips of industrial elastic . <p> One of Flora Carrier 's main advantages is flexibility : A vase of any size or shape can fit . <p> They spent $ 22,000 developing the product . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 arrangements . Prices range from $ 89 to $ 299 . <p> All the research and paperwork involved " a lot of new words for me , " Pena said . <p> She said it is " a blessing to work for myself , and I can take my kids with me . I try to spend as much time with my family as possible . " <p> Her three children spend a lot of their time at the floral shop . Her oldest daughter , Cecile , 18 , helps manage it . Leslie , 10 , a special education student , comes by after school , and Emanuel , 3 , is there all day . <p> As a mother and entrepreneur , Pena keeps busy . <p> She gets up at 3:30 a.m. to read the Bible , wash clothes and dishes , watch TV and do paperwork . She goes back to sleep at 5 a.m. and gets up at 6:30 a.m. to get Leslie ready for school . <p> Pena is thrilled knowing her invention is in the market and being bought by other florists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This idea came from God , " she said .
