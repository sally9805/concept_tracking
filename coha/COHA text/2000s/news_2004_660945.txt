<p> The " war on terror " existed years before the United States invaded Iraq . <p> Most people just did n't think much about it . <p> But when US troops , tanks , and attack aircraft began blasting their way from Kuwait toward Baghdad a year ago Friday , it was a watershed mark in what is likely to be the principal form of armed conflict in the 21st century . <p> In many ways , the battles in Iraq ( and those that preceded them and continue in Afghanistan ) are the first major test of America 's place in this new post-cold-war world - especially of the Bush administration 's more muscular policy of preemptive war , with a go-it-alone attitude if necessary . <p> The largest US war effort since Vietnam already is having a major effect on the US military , including the disposition of forces around the world . <p> Warfighting doctrine , tactics , weaponry , recruiting and retaining military personnel , the role of women now fighting and dying in combat , an unprecedented use of National Guard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being tested . <p> The country 's diplomatic position vis-a-vis its friends and adversaries also faces major challenges as a result of the year-old Iraq war . For example , will last week 's deadly terrorist attack in Spain ( along with Britain , Spain has been one of the major US allies in Iraq ) arouse European countries to help American peacemaking and nationbuilding efforts in Iraq ? Or will it increase public opposition to Mr. Bush 's policy there ? <p> More likely the latter , if Spain 's weekend election is a clue , and this undoubtedly will impact the US military as well . <p> Rumsfeld 's rules <p> The conduct of the war - at least up through the fall of Baghdad - seems to confirm Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's desire to have more lighter , faster-moving combat units able to communicate and coordinate in real time and backed up with long-range , more accurate weapons , and special-operations forces . <p> " Rumsfeld 's notion that you can fight wars with smaller forces I think is for the most part proving out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cato Institute . " But what you ca n't do is occupy countries with smaller forces . So all the defense transformation and technology in the world is not going to help you when it comes to having to occupy a country . " <p> Iraq versus Afghanistan <p> Others point out the difference here between Afghanistan and Iraq - the two major US fronts in the war on terrorism . <p> " Afghanistan suggested that a larger number of smaller ground forces backed with precision munitions , unmanned aerial vehicles , and good communications are the wave of the future for warfighting , " says retired Army Col. Dan Smith . " Then came Iraq , in which the older , bigger legacy systems and units predominated , or seemed to until the Iraqis failed to show up for the war . " <p> That the Iraqi Republican Guard and other elite units faded from the battlefield ( perhaps re-forming into the hit-and-run groups that have continued to kill allied soldiers as well as Iraqi and foreign civilians ) means the true test of the US military has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face similarly inept enemies again in the future , but that is n't what you 'd call a good planning assumption , " says Loren Thompson , head of security studies at the Lexington Institute in Arlington , Va . <p> For years , Pentagon officials planned around the " one-and-a-half war " scenario - one major war ( in central Europe , for example ) and another smaller simultaneous conflict somewhere else in the world . <p> How big should US forces be ? <p> Now , it appears , Pentagon planners have to worry about how to handle the aftermath of even " half " a war - particularly as it affects the hundreds of thousands of troops rotated in and out of peacekeeping and nationbuilding duty . <p> And most of the challenge involves the numbers of soldiers , sailors , airmen , and marines that can be counted on . <p> " Avoiding a personnel crisis in the all-volunteer military has become the chief force management challenge for Secretary Rumsfeld and his successor , " says Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington , " much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases . " <p> To compensate , Army troops from Germany and marines from Okinawa are being rotated into Iraq . <p> " Rumsfeld already had tendencies to pull troops out of existing deployments - Europe and maybe even Korea , " says defense analyst Ivan Eland of the Independent Institute in Oakland , Calif . " The stretch because of Iraq has likely strengthened those tendencies . " <p> At the same time , reserve components now are scheduled to make up 40 percent of the force in Iraq , Kuwait , and Afghanistan . One reason : Reservists and those in the National Guard are more likely than active duty troops to have had the training necessary for postcombat duty , including as translators , military police , and civil affairs specialists . <p> The view from Main Street <p> While such trends may argue for either increasing the active duty force or decreasing their missions around the world , they may also help Americans reconnect with their military . Ever since the end of the draft in 1973 , fewer and fewer Americans have had direct ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small towns around the country now watching their men and women marching off to war , returning with stories of combat , some of them wounded or not coming back at all , that gap between citizen and soldier has closed dramatically . <p> " There is a universal , patriotic pride in what they are doing and how well the rank and file do it , perhaps helped by the embedded reporters who made the operations in Iraq very personal , " says retired Navy Capt . Larry Seaquist , a former warship commander and Pentagon strategist . " There is a huge , personal connection with the war through Guard and Reserve participation , which seems to touch every town and village ; and there is a sense of solidarity generated by the common feeling of vulnerability to terrorist attack . " <p> Still , that could portend trouble for the Pentagon , adds Captain Seaquist : " It could mean that there may be a clash ahead between the citizenry and the high command over what the military does and how they do it .

" <p> Especially since Vietnam , it 's often been observed that military officers are more reluctant to go to war than the elected officials and civilian appointees who set policy . This may become more obvious , especially with the new kind of war in which those in uniform are likely to find themselves . <p> " Military guys are reluctant dragons , " says retired Air Force Col. Sam Gardiner . " They have always been concerned that policymakers fully understand what they are doing before they commit treasure into harm 's way . " <p> " I can hear the arguments when policy makers talk of using force : ' Yes sir , we can win quickly , but that is when the problems will start . We could be there for years .

In other words , what started out as a straightforward battle against an identifiable foe has become unconventional war . <p> " Unfortunately , there is one other lesson that may be emerging from the insurgency that followed conventional victory , " says military analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute , who supported the US invasion . " America 's military is in danger of becoming ' the redcoats ' - a readily identifiable and isolated force that numerically inferior adversaries can gradually wear down through a combination of unconventional tactics and patient pressure .
