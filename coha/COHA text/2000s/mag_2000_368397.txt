These are exciting times around our house , and it 's not the economy , stupid . It 's the election . Our two-year-old loves the balloons . Our seven-year-old ca n't wait to vote in our upcoming bake-off between Tipper Gore 's Ginger Snaps and Laura Bush 's Texas Governor 's Mansion Cowboy Cookies . And our 10-year-old still ca n't get over the friendship between Al Gore and Tommy Lee Jones . <P> After the conventions , though , I was a little worried . Our kids may be gung-ho , but the older ones have n't got a clue about campaign-finance reform , and the youngest would n't know George W. from George of the Jungle . How could we translate their interest into a true political education ? The numbers do n't look good : according to the Federal Election Commission , less than one-third of 18-to-24-year-olds voted in the 1996 presidential election . If we want our oldest to go to the polls in ' 08 , we have to get busy . <P> The candidates ' websites are n't much help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
