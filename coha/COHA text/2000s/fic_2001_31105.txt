There are some men who enter a woman 's life and screw it up forever . Joseph Morelli did this to me  --  not forever , but periodically . Morelli and I were both born and raised in a blue-collar chunk of Trenton called the burg . Houses were attached and narrow . Yards were small . Cars were American . The people were mostly of Italian descent , with enough Hungarians and Germans thrown in to offset inbreeding . It was a good place to buy calzone or play the numbers . And , if you had to live in Trenton anyway , it was an okay place to raise a family . When I was a kid I did n't ordinarily play with Joseph Morelli . He lived two blocks over and was two years older . " Stay away from those Morelli boys , " my mother had warned me . " They 're wild . I hear stories about the things they do to girls when they get them alone . " " What kind of things ? " I 'd eagerly asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had answered . " Terrible things . Things that are n't nice . " From that moment on , I viewed Joseph Morelli with a combination of terror and prurient curiosity that bordered on awe . Two weeks later , at the age of six , with quaking knees and a squishy stomach , I followed Morelli into his father 's garage on the promise of learning a new game . The Morelli garage hunkered detached and snubbed at the edge of their lot . It was a sorry affair , lit by a single shaft of light filtering through a grime-coated window . Its air was stagnant , smelling of corner must , discarded tires , and jugs of used motor oil . Never destined to house the Morelli cars , the garage served other purposes . Old Man Morelli used the garage to take his belt to his sons , his sons used the garage to take their hands to themselves , and Joseph Morelli took me , Stephanie Plum , to the garage to play train . " What 's the name of this game ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd said , down on his hands and knees , crawling between my legs , his head trapped under my short pink skirt . " You 're the tunnel , and I 'm the train . " I suppose this tells something about my personality . That I 'm not especially good at taking advice . Or that I was born with an overload of curiosity . Or maybe it 's about rebellion or boredom or fate . At any rate , it was a one-shot deal and darn disappointing , since I 'd only gotten to be the tunnel , and I 'd really wanted to be the train . Ten years later , Joe Morelli was still living two blocks over . He 'd grown up big and bad , with eyes like black fire one minute and melt-in-your-mouth chocolate the next . He had an eagle tattooed on his chest , a tight-assed , narrow-hipped swagger , and a reputation for having fast hands and clever fingers . My best friend , Mary Lou Molnar , said she heard Morelli had a tongue like a lizard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's that supposed to mean ? " " Just do n't let him get you alone or you 'll find out . Once he gets you alone ... that 's it . You 're done for . " I had n't seen much of Morelli since the train episode . I supposed he 'd enlarged his repertoire of sexual exploitation . I opened my eyes wide and leaned closer to Mary Lou , hoping for the worst . " You are n't talking about rape , are you ? " " I 'm talking about lust ! If he wants you , you 're doomed . The guy is irresistible . " Aside from being fingered at the age of six by you-know-who , I was untouched . I was saving myself for marriage , or at least for college . " I 'm a virgin , " I said , as if this was news . " I 'm sure he does n't mess with virgins . " " He specializes in virgins ! The brush of his fingertips turns virgins into slobbering mush . " Two weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day after school , Tasty Pastry , on Hamilton . He bought a chocolate-chip cannoli , told me he 'd joined the navy , and charmed the pants off me four minutes after closing , on the floor of Tasty Pastry , behind the case filled with chocolate clairs . The next time I saw him , I was three years older . I was on my way to the mall , driving my father 's Buick when I spotted Morelli standing in front of Giovichinni 's Meat Market . I gunned the big V-8 engine , jumped the curb , and clipped Morelli from behind , bouncing him off the front right fender . I stopped the car and got out to assess the damage . " Anything broken ? " He was sprawled on the pavement , looking up my skirt . " My leg . " " Good , " I said . Then I turned on my heel , got into the Buick , and drove to the mall . I attribute the incident to temporary insanity , and in my own defense , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During winter months , wind ripped up Hamilton Avenue , whining past plate-glass windows , banking trash against curbs and storefronts . During summer months , the air sat still and gauzy , leaden with humidity , saturated with hydrocarbons . It shimmered over hot cement and melted road tar . Cicadas buzzed , Dumpsters reeked , and a dusty haze hung in perpetuity over softball fields statewide . I figured it was all part of the great adventure of living in New Jersey . This afternoon I 'd decided to ignore the August buildup of ozone catching me in the back of my throat and go , convertible top down , in my Mazda Miata . The air conditioner was blasting flat out , I was singing along with Paul Simon , my shoulder-length brown hair was whipping around my face in a frenzy of frizz and snarls , my ever vigilant blue eyes were coolly hidden behind my Oakleys , and my foot rested heavy on the gas pedal . It was Sunday , and I had a date with a pot roast at my parents ' house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , swearing when I saw Lenny Gruber two car lengths back in a tan sedan . I thunked my forehead on the steering wheel . " Damn . " I 'd gone to high school with Gruber . He was a maggot then , and he was a maggot now . Unfortunately , he was a maggot with a just cause . I was behind on my Miata payments , and Gruber worked for the repo company . Six months ago , when I 'd bought the car , I 'd been looking good , with a nice apartment and season tickets to the Rangers . And then bam ! I got laid off . No money . No more A-1 credit rating . I rechecked the mirror , set my teeth , and yanked up the emergency brake . Lenny was like smoke . When you tried to grab him , he evaporated , so I was n't about to waste this one last opportunity to bargain . I hauled myself out of my car , apologized to the man caught between us , and stalked back to Gruber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joy and faux surprise . " What a treat . " I leaned two hands on the roof and looked through the open window at him . " Lenny , I 'm going to my parents ' house for dinner . You would n't snatch my car while I was at my parents ' house , would you ? I mean , that would be really low , Lenny . " " I 'm a pretty low guy , Steph . That 's why I 've got this neat job . I 'm capable of most anything . " The light changed , and the driver behind Gruber leaned on his horn . " Maybe we can make a deal , " I said to Gruber . " Does this deal involve you getting naked ? " I had a vision of grabbing his nose and twisting it Three Stooges style until he squealed like a pig . Problem was , it 'd involve touching him . Better to go with a more restrained approach . " Let me keep the car tonight , and I 'll drive it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " Gruber said . " You 're damn sneaky . I 've been chasing after this car for five days . " " So , one more wo n't matter . " " I 'd expect you to be grateful , you know what I mean ? " I almost gagged . " Forget it . Take the car . In fact , you could take it right now . I 'll walk to my parents ' . " Gruber 's eyes were locked halfway down my chest . I 'm a 36B . Respectable but far from overwhelming on my 5 ' 7 " frame . I was wearing black spandex shorts and an oversized hockey jersey . Not what you would call a seductive outfit , but Lenny was ogling anyway . His smile widened enough to show he was missing a molar . " I guess I could wait for tomorrow . After all , we did go to high school together . " " Un huh . " It was the best I could do . Five minutes later I turned off Hamilton onto Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel familial obligation sucking at me , pulling me into the heart of the burg . This was a community of extended families . There was safety here , along with love , and stability , and the comfort of ritual . The clock on the dash told me I was seven minutes late , and the urge to scream told me I was home . I parked at the curb and looked at the narrow two-story duplex with its jalousied front porch and aluminum awnings . The Plum half was yellow , just as it had been for forty years , with a brown shingle roof . Snowball bushes flanked either side of the cement stoop , and red geraniums had been evenly spaced the length of the porch . It was basically a flat . Living room in front , dining room in the middle , kitchen at the rear . Three bedrooms and bath upstairs . It was a small , tidy house crammed with kitchen smells and too much furniture , comfortable with its lot in life . Next door , Mrs. Markowitz , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint colors , had painted her side lime green . My mother was at the open screen door . " Stephanie , " she called . " What are you doing sitting out there in your car ? You 're late for dinner . You know how your father hates to eat late . The potatoes are getting cold . The pot roast will be dry . " Food is important in the burg . The moon revolves around the earth , the earth revolves around the sun , and the burg revolves around pot roast . For as long as I can remember , my parents ' lives have been controlled by five-pound pieces of rolled rump , done to perfection at six o'clock . Grandma Mazur stood two feet back from my mother . " I got ta get me a pair of those , " she said , eyeballing my shorts . " I 've still got pretty good legs , you know . " She raised her skirt and looked down at her knees . " What do you think ? You think I 'd look good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like doorknobs . She 'd been a beauty in her time , but the years had turned her slack-skinned and spindle-boned . Still , if she wanted to wear biker shorts , I thought she should go for it . The way I saw it , that was one of the many advantages to living in New Jersey  --  even old ladies were allowed to look outlandish . My father gave a grunt of disgust from the kitchen , where he was carving up the meat . " Biker 's shorts , " he muttered , slapping his palm against his forehead . " Unh ! " Two years ago , when Grandpa Mazur 's fat-clogged arteries sent him to the big pork roast in the sky , Grandma Mazur had moved in with my parents and had never moved out . My father accepted this with a combination of Old World stoicism and tactless mutterings . I remember him telling me about a dog he 'd had as a kid . The story goes that this dog was the ugliest , oldest , most pea-brained dog ever . The dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth were rotted in its mouth , its hips were fused solid with arthritis , and huge fatty tumors lumped under its hide . One day my Grandpa Plum took the dog out behind the garage and shot it . I suspected there were times when my father fantasized a similar ending for my Grandma Mazur . " You should wear a dress , " my mother said to me , bringing green beans and creamed pearl onions to the table . " Thirty years old and you 're still dressing in those teeny-bopper outfits . How will you ever catch a nice man like that ? " " I do n't want a man . I had one , and I did n't like it . " " That 's because your husband was a horse 's behind , " Grandma Mazur said . I agreed . My ex-husband had been a horse 's behind . Especially when I 'd caught him flagrante delicto on the dining room table with Joyce Barnhardt . " I hear Loretta Buzick 's boy is separated from his wife , " my mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew where she was heading , and I did n't want to go there . " I 'm not going out with Ronald Buzick , " I told her . " Do n't even think about it . " " So what 's wrong with Ronald Buzick ? " Ronald Buzick was a butcher . He was balding , and he was fat , and I suppose I was being a snob about the whole thing , but I found it hard to think in romantic terms about a man who spent his days stuffing giblets up chicken butts . My mother plunged on . " All right , then how about Bernie Kuntz ? I saw Bernie Kuntz in the dry cleaner 's , and he made a point about asking for you . I think he 's interested . I could invite him over for coffee and cake . " With the way my luck was running , probably my mother had already invited Bernie , and at this very moment he was circling the block , popping Tic Tacs . " I do n't want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I need to tell you . I have some bad news .... " I 'd been dreading this and had put it off for as long as possible . My mother clapped a hand to her mouth . " You found a lump in your breast ! " No one in our family had ever found a lump in their breast , but my mother was ever watchful . " My breast is fine . The problem is with my job . " " What about your job ? " " I do n't have one . I got laid off . " " Laid off ! " she said on a sharp inhale . " How could that happen ? It was such a good job . You loved that job . " I 'd been a discount lingerie buyer for E.E . Martin , and I 'd worked in Newark , which is not exactly the garden spot of the garden State . In truth , it had been my mother who had loved the job , imagining it to be glamorous when in reality I 'd mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martin was n't exactly Victoria 's Secret . " I would n't worry , " my mother said . " There 's always work for lingerie buyers . " " There 's no work for lingerie buyers . " Especially ones who worked for E.E . Martin . Having held a salaried position with E.E . Martin made me as appealing as a leper . E.E . Martin had skimped on the palm greasing this winter , and as a result its mob affiliations were made public . The C.E.O . was indicted for illegal business practices , E.E . Martin sold out to Baldicott , Inc. , and , through no fault of my own , I was caught in the house-cleaning sweep . " I 've been out of work for six months . " " Six months ! And I did n't know ! Your own mother did n't know you were out on the streets ? " " I 'm not out on the streets . I 've been doing temporary jobs . Filing and stuff . " And steadily sliding downhill . I was registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I religiously read the want ads . I was n't being all that choosy , drawing the line at telephone soliciting and kennel attendant , but my future did n't look great . I was overqualified for entry level , and I lacked experience in management . My father forked another slab of pot roast onto his plate . He 'd worked for the post office for thirty years and had opted for early retirement . Now he drove a cab part-time . " I saw your cousin Vinnie yesterday , " he said . " He 's looking for someone to do filing . You should give him a call . " Just the career move I 'd been hoping for  --  filing for Vinnie . Of all my relatives , Vinnie was my least favorite . Vinnie was a worm , a sexual lunatic , a dog turd . " What does he pay ? " I asked . My father shrugged . " Got ta be minimum wage . " Wonderful . The perfect position for someone already in the depths of despair . Rotten boss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for myself would be endless . " And the best part is that it 's close , " my mother said . " You can come home every day for lunch . " I nodded numbly , thinking I 'd sooner stick a needle in my eye . Sunlight slanted through the crack in my bedroom curtains , the air-conditioning unit in the living room window droned ominously , predicting another scorcher of a morning , and the digital display on my clock radio flashed electric blue numbers , telling me it was nine o'clock . The day had started without me . I rolled out of bed on a sigh and shuffled into the bathroom . When I was done in the bathroom , I shuffled into the kitchen and stood in front of the refrigerator , hoping the refrigerator fairies had visited during the night . I opened the door and stared at the empty shelves , noting that food had n't magically cloned itself from the smudges in the butter keeper and the shriveled flotsam at the bottom of the crisper . Half a jar of mayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue mold , a head of iceberg lettuce , shrink-wrapped in brown slime and plastic , and a box of hamster nuggets stood between me and starvation . I wondered if nine in the morning was too early to drink beer . Of course in Moscow it would be four in the afternoon . Good enough . I drank half the beer and grimly approached the living room window . I pulled the curtains and stared down at the parking lot . My Miata was gone . Lenny had hit early . No surprise , but still , it lodged painfully in the middle of my throat . I was now an official deadbeat . And if that was n't depressing enough , I 'd weakened halfway through dessert and promised my mother I 'd go see Vinnie . I dragged myself into the shower and stumbled out a half hour later after an exhausting crying jag . I stuffed myself into pantyhose and a suit and was ready to do my daughterly duty . My hamster , Rex , was still asleep in his soup can in his cage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his bowl and made some smoochy sounds . Rex opened his black eyes and blinked . He twitched his whiskers , gave a good sniff , and rejected the nuggets . I could n't blame him . I 'd tried them for breakfast yesterday and had n't been impressed . I locked up the apartment and walked three blocks down St. James to Blue Ribbon Used Cars . At the front of the lot was a $500 Nova begging to be bought . Total body rust and countless accidents had left the Nova barely recognizable as a car , much less a Chevy , but Blue Ribbon was willing to trade the beast for my TV and VCR . I threw in my food processor and microwave , and they paid my registration and taxes . I drove the Nova out of the lot and went straight to Vinnie . I pulled into a parking space at the corner of Hamilton and Olden , extracted the key from the ignition , and waited for the car to thrash itself off . I said a short prayer not to be spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scuttled the short distance to the storefront office . The blue and white sign over the door read " Vincent Plum Bail Bonding Company . " In smaller letters it advertised twenty-four-hour nationwide service . Conveniently located between Tender Loving Care Dry Cleaners and Fiorello 's Deli , Vincent Plum catered to the family trade  --  domestic disturbances , disorderlies , auto theft , DWI , and shoplifting . The office was small and generic , consisting of two rooms with cheap walnut paneling on the walls and commercial grade rust-colored carpet on the floor . A Danish modern couch upholstered in brown Naugahyde pressed against one wall of the reception area , and a black and brown metal desk with a multiline phone and a computer terminal occupied a far corner . Vinnie 's secretary sat behind the desk , her head bent in concentration , picking her way through a stack of files . " Yeah ? " " I 'm Stephanie Plum . I 've come to see my cousin , Vinnie . " " Stephanie Plum ! " Her head came up . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , Tina . Oh jeez , I hope you do n't have to make bail . " I recognized her now . She was an older version of Tina . Thicker in the waist , heavier in the face . She had lots of teased black hair , flawless olive skin , and a five-o'clock shadow on her upper lip . " The only thing I have to make is money , " I said to Connie . " I hear Vinnie needs someone to do filing . " " We just filled that job , and between you and me , you did n't miss anything . It was a crummy job . Paid minimum wage , and you had to spend all day on your knees singing the alphabet song . My feeling is , if you 're going to spend that much time on your knees , you could find something that pays better . You know what I mean ? " " Last time I was on my knees was two years ago . I was looking for a contact lens . " " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get Vinnie to let you do skip tracing ? There 's good money in it . " " How much money ? " " Ten percent of the bond . " Connie pulled a file from her top drawer . " We got this one in yesterday . Bail was set at $100,000 , and he did n't show up for a court appearance . If you could find him and bring him in , you 'd get $10,000 . " I put a hand to the desk to steady myself . " Ten thousand dollars for finding one guy ? What 's the catch ? " " Sometimes they do n't want to be found , and they shoot at you . But that hardly ever happens . " Connie leafed through the file . " The guy who came in yesterday is local . Morty Beyers started tracking him down , so some of the prelim is already done . You 've got pictures and everything . " " What happened to Morty Beyers ? " " Busted appendix . Happened at eleven-thirty last night . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tube up his nose . " I did n't want to wish Morty Beyers any misfortune , but I was starting to get excited about the prospect of stepping into his shoes . The money was tempting , and the job title had a certain cachet . On the other hand , catching fugitives sounded scary , and I was a certifiable coward when it came to risking my body parts . " My guess is , it would n't be hard to find this guy , " Connie said . " You could go talk to his mother . And if it gets hairy , you could back out . What have you got to lose ? " Only my life . " I do n't know . I do n't like the part about the shooting . " " Probably , it 's like driving the turnpike , " Connie said . " Probably , you get used to it . The way I see it , living in New Jersey is a challenge , what with the toxic waste and the eighteen-wheelers and the armed schizophrenics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Pretty much my own philosophy . And the $10,000 was damned appealing . I could pay off my creditors and straighten my life out . " Okay , " I said . " I 'll do it . " " You have to talk to Vinnie first . " Connie swiveled her chair toward Vinnie 's office door . " Hey Vinnie ! " she yelled . " You got business out here . " Vinnie was forty-five , 5 ' 7 " without his lifts , and had the slim , boneless body of a ferret . He wore pointy-toed shoes , liked pointy-breasted women and dark-skinned young men , and he drove a Cadillac Seville . " Steph here wants to do some skip tracing , " Connie said to Vinnie . " No way . Too dangerous , " Vinnie said . " Most of my agents used to be in security . And you have to know something about law enforcement . " " I can learn about law enforcement , " I told him . " Learn about it first . Then come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not my problem . " I figured it was time to get tough . " I 'll make it your problem , Vinnie . I 'll have a long talk with Lucille . " Lucille was Vinnie 's wife and the only woman in the burg who did n't know about Vinnie 's addiction to kinky sex . Lucille had her eyes firmly closed , and it was n't my place to pry them open . Of course , if she ever asked ... that 'd be a whole other ball game . " You 'd blackmail me ? Your own cousin ? " " These are desperate times . " He turned to Connie . " Give her a few civil cases . Stuff that involves telephone work . " " I want this one , " I said , pointing to the file on Connie 's desk . " I want the $10,000 one . " " Forget it . It 's a murder . I should never have posted bail , but he was from the burg , and I felt sorry for his mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . " " I need the money , Vinnie . Give me a chance at bringing him in . " " When hell freezes over , " Vinnie said . " I do n't get this guy back , I 'm in the hole for a hundred grand . I 'm not sending an amateur after him . " Connie rolled her eyes at me . " You 'd think it was out of his pocket . He 's owned by an insurance company . It 's no big deal . " " So give me a week , Vinnie , " I said . " If I do n't get him in a week , you can turn it over to someone else . " " I would n't give you a half hour . " I took a deep breath and leaned close to Vinnie , whispering in his ear . " I know about Madam Zaretski and her whips and chains . I know about the boys . And I know about the duck . " He did n't say anything . He just pressed his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had him . Lucille would throw up if she knew what he did to the duck . Then she 'd tell her father , Harry the Hammer , and Harry would cut off Vinnie 's dick . " Who am I looking for ? " I asked Vinnie . Vinnie handed me the file . " Joseph Morelli . " My heart flipped in my chest . I knew Morelli had been involved in a homicide . It had been big news in the burg , and details of the shooting had been splashed across the front page of the Trenton Times . VICE COP KILLS UNARMED MAN . That had been over a month ago , and other , more important issues ( like the exact amount of the lottery ) had replaced talk of Morelli . In the absence of more information , I 'd assumed the shooting had been in the line of duty . I had n't realized Morelli 'd been charged with murder . The reaction was n't lost to Vinnie . " From the look on your face , I 'd say you know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was in high school . " Connie grunted . " Honey , half of all the women in New Jersey have sold him their cannoli. "
