Americans are not renowned for their powers of self-deprivation ; doing without is not something we do particularly well . But experts say there is one necessity of life most of us consistently fail to get : a good night 's sleep . <P> The recommended daily requirements should sound familiar : eight hours of sleep a night for adults and at least an hour more for adolescents . Yet 71% of American adults and 85% of teens do not get the suggested amount , to the detriment of body and mind . " Sleep is sort of like food , " says Robert Stickgold , a cognitive neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School . But , he adds , there 's one important difference : " You can be quite starved and still alive , and I think we appreciate how horrible that must be . But many of us live on the edge of sleep starvation and just accept it . " <P> Part of the problem is we are so used to being chronically sleep deprived  --  and have become so adept at coping with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are . In 2003 , sleep expert David Dinges and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine tested the effects of restricting slumber to eight , six or four hours a night for two weeks . During the first few days , subjects sleeping less than eight hours admitted to being fatigued and lacking alertness . But by Day 4 , most people had adapted to their new baseline drowsiness and reported feeling fine  --  even as their cognitive performance continued to plummet . <P> Over time , the experiment 's sleep-restricted subjects became so impaired that they had difficulty concentrating on even the simplest tasks , like pushing a button in response to a light . " The human brain is only capable of about 16 hours of wakefulness a day , " says Dinges . " When you get beyond that , it ca n't function as efficiently , as accurately or as well . " <P> In the real world , people overcome their somnolence  --  at least temporarily  --  by drinking coffee , taking a walk around the block or chatting with office mates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , worse , behind the wheel . Those short snatches of unconsciousness are what researchers call microsleep , a sure sign of sleep deprivation . " If people are falling asleep because ' the room was hot ' or ' the meeting was boring , ' that 's not coping with sleep loss . I would argue that they 're eroding their productive capability , " says Dinges . <P> What most people do n't realize is that the purpose of sleep may be more to rest the mind than to rest the body . Indeed , most of the benefits of eight hours ' sleep seem to accrue to the brain : sleep helps consolidate memory , improve judgment , promote learning and concentration , boost mood , speed reaction time and sharpen problem solving and accuracy . According to Sonia Ancoli-Israel , a psychologist at the University of California at San Diego who has done extensive studies in the aging population , lack of sleep may even mimic the symptoms of dementia . In recent preliminary findings , she was able to improve cognitive function in patients with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep disorder . " The need for sleep does not change a lot with age , " says Ancoli-Israel , but often because of disruptive illnesses and the medications used to treat them , " the ability to sleep does .
