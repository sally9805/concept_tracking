The Great Rivalry ( 479-439 ) // The world of the Greeks extended from scattered cities on the south coast of Spain at the far western end of the Mediterranean to the eastern shore of the Black Sea in the east . A concentration of Greek cities dominated the southern part of the Italian peninsula and most of the coastal area of Sicily , but the center of the Greek world was the Aegean Sea . Most of the Greek cities , including the most important ones , stood on the southern part of the Balkan peninsula that is modern Greece , on the eastern shore of the Aegean , in Anatolia ( modern Turkey ) , on the islands of the Aegean , and on its northern shore . // At the outbreak of the war some of the cities in this region were neutral , but many , and the most important of them , had come under the hegemony of either Sparta or Athens , two states that were probably as different as any two in the Greek world and that looked upon each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // SPARTA AND ITS ALLIANCE // Sparta led the older organization , which was formed in the sixth century . In their own territory of Laconia the Spartans ruled over two kinds of subordinate peoples . The helots , who stood somewhere between serfdom and slavery , farmed the land and provided the Spartans with food , while the perioikoi , personally free but subject to Spartan control , manufactured and traded for what the Spartans needed . The Spartans alone had no need to earn a living and devoted themselves exclusively to military training . This enabled them to develop the best army in the Greek world , a group of citizen-soldiers with professional training and skill , unlike any other . // But the Spartan social structure was a potentially dangerous one . The helots outnumbered their Spartan masters by some seven to one and , as an Athenian who knew Sparta well put it , " They would gladly eat the Spartans raw " ( Xenophon , Hellenica 3.3.6 ) . To meet the challenge of their occasional rebellions the Spartans created a constitution and a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the needs of the state . They allowed only physically perfect infants to live ; boys were taken from their homes at age seven to be trained and toughened in military school until they were twenty . From twenty to thirty they lived in barracks , helping in turn to educate the new young recruits . They were allowed to marry but could visit their wives only by stealth . At thirty the Spartan male became a full citizen , an " equal " ( homoios ) . He took his meals at a public mess with fourteen comrades , dining simply , often on a black soup that appalled the other Greeks . Military service was required until age sixty . The entire system aimed to produce soldiers whose physical powers , training , and discipline made them the best in the world . // In spite of their military superiority , the Spartans were usually reluctant to go to war , chiefly because of their fear that the helots would take advantage of any long absence of the army to rebel . Thucydides pointed out that " most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to security against the helots " ( 4.80.3 ) , and Aristotle said that the helots " are like someone sitting in wait for disasters to strike the Spartans " ( Politics 1269a ) . // In the sixth century the Spartans developed a network of perpetual alliances to safeguard their peculiar community . Modern scholars usually call the Spartan Alliance the Peloponnesian League , but it was in fact a loose organization consisting of Sparta , on the one hand , and a group of allies connected to her by separate treaties on the other . When called upon , the allies served as soldiers under Spartan command . Each state swore to follow Sparta 's lead in foreign policy in return for Spartan protection and recognition of its integrity and autonomy . // Pragmatism , not theory , provided the interpretive principle within the alliance . The Spartans helped their allies when it was to their advantage or unavoidable , compelling others to join in a conflict whenever it was necessary and possible . The entire alliance met only when the Spartans chose , and we hear of few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by military , political , or geographical circumstances , and they reveal three informal categories of allies . One consisted of states that were small enough and close enough to Sparta as to be easily controlled such as Phlius or Orneae . States in the second category , including Megara , Elis , and Mantinea , were stronger , or more remote , or both , but not so powerful and distant as to escape ultimate punishment if it was merited . Thebes and Corinth were the only states in the third group , states so far removed and mighty in their own right that their conduct of foreign policy was rarely subordinated to Spartan interests . ( See Map 1. ) // Argos , a large state to the northeast of Sparta , was an old and traditional enemy , and not a member of the Spartan Alliance . The Spartans had always feared an Argive union with other enemies , and especially its providing assistance to a helot rebellion . Anything that threatened the integrity of the Peloponnesian League or the loyalty of any of its members was considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparta 's political order as a " mixed constitution " containing monarchic , oligarchic , and democratic elements . The monarchic constituent appeared in the form of two kings , each from a different royal family . The gerousia , a council of twenty-eight men over the age of sixty elected from a small number of privileged families , represented the oligarchic principle . The assembly , consisting of all Spartan men over thirty , was a democratic element , as were the five ephors , magistrates elected annually by the citizens . // The two kings served for life , led Sparta 's armies , performed important religious and judicial functions , and enjoyed great prestige and influence . Since they often disagreed , factions formed around them on different sides of an issue . The gerousia sat with the kings as the highest court in the land , the one to which the kings themselves were brought to trial . The prestige they held because of family connections , age , and experience in a society that venerated such things , and the honor that accompanied their election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had important powers , especially in foreign affairs . They received foreign envoys , negotiated treaties , and ordered expeditions once war had been declared . They also summoned and presided over the assembly , sat with the gerousia and were its executive officers , and had the right to bring charges of treason against the kings . // Formal decisions on treaties , foreign relations , and war and peace belonged to the assembly , but its real powers were limited . Its meetings occurred only when called by officials . Little debate took place at them , and the speakers were usually the kings , members of the gerousia , or ephors . Voting was typically by acclamation , the equivalent of a voice vote ; division and the counting of votes were rare . // For three centuries this constitution had been unchanged by law , coup d ' ? tat , or revolution . In spite of such constitutional stability , however , Sparta 's foreign policy was often unsteady . Conflicts between the kings , between ephors and kings , and among the ephors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation of boards of ephors could weaken Sparta 's control of its alliance . An ally could pursue its own interests and policy by exploiting Sparta 's internal divisions . Sparta 's mighty army and its command of the alliance gave the Spartans enormous power , but if they used it against a strong enemy outside the Peloponnesus , they ran the risk of a helot rebellion or an Argive attack . If they did not use it when called upon by their more important allies , they risked defections and the dissolution of the alliance on which their security rested . In the crisis leading to war both these factors would shape Spartan decisions . // ATHENS AND ITS EMPIRE // The Athenian Empire emerged from a new alliance formed after the Greek victory in the Persian Wars . First its leader , then its master , Athens had a unique history that helped shape its character long before it became a democracy and rose to dominance . It was the chief town of the region known as Attica , a small triangular peninsula extending southeastward from central Greece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles is mountainous and rocky and unavailable for cultivation , early Attica was relatively poor , even by Greek standards . However , its geography proved a blessing when invaders from the north swept down and and occupied the more attractive lands of the Peloponnesus , regarding Attica as not worth the trouble of conquest . Unlike the Spartans , the Athenians claimed to have sprung from their own soil and to have lived in the same region since before the birth of the moon . As a result , they did not have to contend with the burden of an oppressed , alien , and discontented underclass . // Because Athens unified the entire region quite early in its history it was not troubled by quarrels and wars with other towns in Attica . Each of them became part of the Athenian city-state , and all their free , native-born inhabitants were Athenian citizens on an equal basis . The absence of intense pressures , internal and external , may help explain Athens ' relatively untroubled nonviolent early history and its emergence in the fifth century as the first democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperity of the fifth-century Athenian democracy depended primarily on its command of its great maritime empire , centered on the Aegean Sea , the islands in it , and the cities along its coast . It began as an association of " the Athenians and their allies " called by modern scholars the Delian League , a voluntary alliance of Greek states that invited Athens to take the lead in continuing the war of liberation and vengeance against Persia . It gradually became an empire under Athenian command , functioning chiefly to the advantage of Athens ( see Map 2 ) . Over the years almost all its members gave up their own fleets and chose instead to make a money payment into the common treasury . The Athenians used these funds to increase the number of their own ships , and to pay the rowers to stay at their oars for eight months each year , so that eventually the Athenian navy had by far the biggest and best Greek fleet ever known . On the eve of the Peloponnesian War , of some 150 members of the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fleets and enjoyed relative autonomy . Even they , however , were unlikely to defy Athenian orders . // The Athenians made a large profit from their imperial holdings and used it for their own purposes , especially for the great building program that beautified and glorified their city and provided work for its people , and for the accumulation of a large reserve fund . The navy protected the ships of Athenian merchants in their prosperous trade throughout the Mediterranean and beyond . It also guaranteed the Athenians access to the wheat fields of Ukraine and the fish of the Black Sea , with which they could supplement their inadequate domestic food supply and , with the use of imperial money , even replace it totally if forced to abandon their own fields in the course of war . Once they completed the walls surrounding their city and connecting them by additional Long Walls to the fortified port at Piraeus , as they did in midcentury , the Athenians were virtually invulnerable . // In Athens the assembly made all decisions on policy , foreign and domestic , military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lot from the Athenian citizens , prepared bills for the assembly 's consideration but was totally subordinate to the larger body . The assembly met no fewer than forty times a year in the open air , on the Pnyx hill beside the Acropolis , overlooking the Agora , the marketplace and civic center . All male citizens were permitted to attend , vote , make proposals , and debate . At the start of the war about forty thousand Athenians were eligible , but attendance rarely exceeded six thousand . Strategic decisions were thus debated before thousands of people , a majority of whom had to approve the particular details of each action . The assembly voted on every expedition , the number and specific nature of ships and men , the funds to be spent , the commanders to lead the forces , and the precise instructions to be given those commanders . // The most important offices in the Athenian state , and among the few filled by election rather than by lottery , were those of the ten generals . Because they commanded divisions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be military men ; because they were elected for only a one-year term , and could be reelected without limit , they also had to be politicians . These leaders could impose military discipline while on campaign , but not within the city . At least ten times a year they were required to face a formal presentation of any complaint against their behavior in office , and at the end of their term they had to make a full accounting of their conduct , military and financial . On each occasion they were subject to trial if accused and serious punishment if convicted . // The ten generals together did not constitute a cabinet or a government ; the assembly fulfilled the latter role . Sometimes , however , a remarkable general would gain so much political support and influence as to become the leader of the Athenians in fact , if not in law . Such was Cimon for the seventeen years between 479 and 462 , when he appears to have been elected general annually , to have led every important expedition , and to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abroad . After the departure of Cimon , Pericles achieved similar success over an even longer period . // Thucydides introduces him into his history as " Pericles son of Xanthippus , the leading man in Athens at that time and the ablest in speech and in action " ( 1.139.4 ) . Thucydides ' readers knew far more than that about the most famous and brilliant individual ever to have led the Athenian democracy . He was an aristocrat of the bluest blood , son of a victorious general and hero of the Persian War . An ancestor on his mother 's side was a niece of Cleisthenes , the founder of Athenian democracy . The family tradition was populist , however , and Pericles emerged as a notable figure on the democratic side early in his career . At about the age of thirty-five he became the leader of that political group , an informal but powerful position that he held for the rest of his life . // To that position he brought extraordinary powers of communication and thought . //       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
