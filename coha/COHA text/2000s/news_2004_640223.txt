<p> WASHINGTON - President Bush stoked the roaring national debate over gay marriage on Tuesday when he joined efforts by religious conservatives to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban homosexuals from marrying . <p> Bush said that the arduous and divisive task of amending the Constitution is justified because the nation needs to defend ' the most fundamental institution of civilization ' from ' activist ' judges and politicians who seek to undermine marriage . <p> Even with the president 's endorsement , the prospects for an amendment are uncertain . Republican leaders in the GOP-controlled Congress said their ranks are divided on the issue , and leading Democrats announced their opposition . <p> Any amendment will have to be passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress and then ratified by the legislatures of 38 states . <p> Though majorities of the U.S. public consistently tell pollsters they believe marriage should be only between a man and a woman , there is far less certainty about the wisdom of amending the Constitution to explicitly deny a right to a minority group of American citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his party 's presidential nomination , immediately announced that he would vote against the amendment if it came to the Senate floor . <p> ' All Americans should be concerned when a president who is in political trouble tries to tamper with the Constitution a at the start of his re-election campaign , ' Kerry said . ' This president ca n't talk about jobs . He ca n't talk about health care . He ca n't talk about a foreign policy which has driven away allies and weakened the United States , so he is looking for a wedge issue to divide the American people . <p> ' While I believe marriage is between a man and a woman , I believe the issue of marriage should be left to the states . ' <p> Kerry endorsed the idea of civil unions , which would grant property , health care , and other marriage rights to gay partners . Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , Kerry 's foremost Democratic challenger , also declared his opposition to the amendment . <p> ' I do n't personally support gay marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been that it 's for the states to decide . ' <p> Bush made his announcement at the White House and took no questions . It came the morning after he kicked off his re-election campaign with a partisan speech at a reception of the Republican Governors Association . <p> ' If we are to prevent the meaning of marriage from being changed forever , our nation must enact a constitutional amendment to protect marriage , ' Bush said Tuesday . ' Attempts to redefine marriage in a single state or city could have serious consequences throughout the country . ' <p> While not specifically addressing the issue of civil unions , Bush said any amendment banning same-sex marriage should leave the states ' free to make their own choices in defining legal arrangements other than marriage . ' <p> Bush did not specifically mention it , but a constitutional amendment sponsored by Rep. Marilyn Musgrave and Sen. Wayne Allard - both Colorado Republicans - appeared to fit his description . Though some legal scholars disagree , Musgrave insists her amendment would ban only gay marriage , not civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come out and endorsed it , ' Musgrave said , ' and of course when the president gets behind something , it greatly encourages passage . <p> ' I think it will give a clear message to the leadership that the president expects action . With the things going on in San Francisco , New Mexico and of course Massachusetts a the American public 's attitude is they expect something to happen . ' <p> Bush staked his argument for amending the Constitution not on what has happened in the United States - where gay marriages are not yet legally permitted by any state - but on what could happen if recent trends continue . <p> The courts in Massachusetts and Vermont , the mayor of San Francisco and a county official in New Mexico have recently concluded that their state laws or constitutions confer the privileges of marriage on all residents , not just heterosexual couples . Bush said such judgments were the arbitrary , aggressive and defiant acts of ' activist ' officials who sought to ' redefine marriage . ' <p> And because the Constitution has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of contracts recognized by one state must be honored by others , Bush warned , ' those who want to change the meaning of marriage will claim that this provision requires all states and cities to recognize same-sex marriages performed anywhere . ' <p> In Vermont , however , the legislature satisfied the state court by passing a civil-union law . In Massachusetts , state leaders are pushing for an amendment to the state constitution that would overrule the state court 's decision . The validity of some 3,000 marriage licenses granted in San Francisco is being questioned in court . And Congress and 38 states have already passed laws defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman . <p> Bush 's critics said that the president , facing a polarized electorate in an election year , is endorsing the amendment to fire up conservatives . <p> Rep. Diana DeGette , D-Colo. , said the president and his Republican allies were ' wrong to do something so mean-spirited in order to try and inflame their base for the election . <p> ' It goes against the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and limited federal rule , ' DeGette said . ' Why on Earth amend the Constitution on what is essentially a state issue ? ' <p> In a Gallup poll this month , those interviewed lined up against gay marriage 59 to 36 percent . The prospect of amending the Constitution , however , gives pause to those who otherwise disapprove of gay marriage . <p> When given the choice between allowing the states to define marriage and amending the Constitution to ban homosexuals from marrying , 58 percent of the respondents in an ABC-Washington Post poll taken in mid-January said they would prefer that the matter be left to the states . <p> Republican strategist Grover Norquist said that the political terrain regarding gay marriage is largely unknown because it has not been a major factor in national or congressional elections . <p> Norquist questioned whether the GOP could pull significant numbers of voters from the Democratic ranks on the issue , because those who are upset by the Democratic Party 's liberal take on cultural issues ' have already come over ' to the Republicans . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could backfire on Republicans if it inspires gay voters to get to the polls , or to empty their wallets , for Democratic candidates . <p> Rep. Deborah Pryce , the Ohio Republican who chairs the House GOP conference , said last week that ' issues like gay marriage will be very motivating ' to the party 's conservative base , but that House Republicans were far from united on the amendment . <p> ' There is some trepidation this is going to be divisive for us when we do n't need to be divided , ' she said . <p> Acknowledging that division , House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , R-Texas , said GOP leaders would be ' deliberative ' and that he could not guarantee passage in the Republican-controlled House this year . <p> The Log Cabin Republicans , a major GOP gay group , blasted the president for siding with the ' gay-bashing radical right ' and ' writing discrimination into our Constitution . ' <p> But Allard praised Bush for taking a ' courageous stand . ' <p> " The president has made it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist courts are seeking to redefine the institution of marriage in our society without regard for the wishes of the American people , " he said . " Judicial activism in this arena must be curtailed . "
