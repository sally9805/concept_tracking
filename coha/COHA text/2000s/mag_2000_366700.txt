If the Los Angeles Lakers win the NBA championship this year , their fans will have two people to thank : Phil Jackson and Friedrich Nietzsche . <P> Jackson , the head coach of the Lakers , has always had an appealingly philosophical approach toward coaching , one that can coax five NBA-size egos into performing like a marching band at full sprint . " All of us had flashes of this sense of oneness  --  making love , creating a work of art , " he says in his autobiography , Sacred Hoops , " when we 're completely immersed in the moment , inseparable from what we 're doing . This kind of experience happens all the time on the basketball floor . " <P> Well , not in L.A. last year , where the Lakers went through two coaches on the way to being swept out of the play-offs . This year , his first with the Lakers , Jackson has a roster brimming with talent , including superstar-of-the-future Kobe Bryant , superstar-of-the-present Shaquille O'Neal and old pros such as Glen Rice , A.C. Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same team , a bit more mature perhaps , and Shaq is healthy , but the big difference is that the Lakers are winning . Under Jackson , the Lakers sport the glossiest record in the NBA ( 51-11 ) , and O'Neal is having an MVP season . " We 've had a good first half , " says the massive 315-lb. , 7-ft. 1-in . O'Neal , who is averaging almost 30 points a game . " Now we have to maintain . " Adds Jackson : " To be quite frank , I did n't think they 'd be this far along now . " <P> Jackson , 54 , has come a long way himself . He was born in Deer Lodge , Mont. , and reared in Williston , N.D. His parents were ministers , so he became drawn to issues of spirituality at an early age . His career path , however , was secular : he was a star basketball player at the University of North Dakota and a role player ( nicknamed " Action " Jackson ) in the NBA , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 and 1973 . There he became close friends with teammate Bill Bradley . Indeed , Jackson was being touted as a possible head coach of the Bradley campaign before he took the Lakers job . <P> Jackson 's interest in Eastern thought and Native American mysticism ( hence Sacred Hoops ) increasingly informed his approach to coaching . Drawing from Buddhism , he speaks often of rejecting selfishness and egotism . In winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls , he emphasized selfless movement without the ball in a pattern known as the triangle offense . The triangle forced defenses to stretch , to cover everyone , everywhere  --  and that left the opposing team vulnerable to Michael Jordan . <P> Jackson 's players often talk about his contributions in abstract terms that reflect his thoughtful outlook on the game . Bryant credits Jackson with helping him to become " more aware " of what 's happening on the basketball court . " It sounds like a minor thing , " says Bryant , " but it 's very big when you 're playing at this level to really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neal , he has shown fresh dedication to solving his problems at the free-throw line , a place where he has laid down enough bricks to qualify for union membership . " He 's much better , " says Jackson . " He 's been dedicating a lot of time off-hours to just shooting free throws . His poise , his confidence , his touch are better . He has some fundamental things wrong with his shot , but he 's trying to correct those . "
