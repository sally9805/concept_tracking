He looked out of place in Greektown , out of place in Detroit as a whole , frankly . He could have been a European fashion model : the unmuscular , haunted type , only weirder . He wore a dark suit cut from what appeared to be raw silk , with a glowing white shirt and a deep pink ascot . Perched at an angle over his floppy hair was a beret , for God 's sake , and he was smoking a cigarette . I tried to read his expression . His eyes , half hidden by the hair , were aggressive , but his lips were parted as if in a question . He watched me and I watched him , and recognition dawned . I knew this man . He swung his arm off the pole and threw away his cigarette . I stopped playing . Lonnie lifted his head toward the man 's footsteps as he dodged traffic across the street . A car honked . The man stood before me . " Lillian ! " he said . " Duane ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My . God . " I put down my instrument and threw my arms around him . He hugged me tight . " Duane , Duane , Duane ! " I laughed . " My God ! I ca n't believe it 's you ! " Cliches poured out of me . " It 's so good to see you . My old buddy ! After all these years ! I ca n't believe it ! " " Oh , Lillian , " he said , burying his face in my shoulder , " I never thought I 'd see you again . " I felt moisture on my collarbone . " Duane , it 's all right . " I stroked his beret . He sobbed a little . I held him out from me . " Hey , buddy , " I smiled , " get ahold of yourself . Are you OK ? " " II 'm all right , " he said , sniffing hard and smiling . With a brave flourish he produced a silk pocket square and blotted his eyes . " I 'm overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Lonnie , this is Duane Sechrist , my old friend . " " Lonnie Williams . " He held out his hand and Duane shook it . " Pleased to meet you , " said Duane . I said , " My God , I have n't seen you since " " That summer . " " That summer day . " " We were twelve , remember ? " Oh , yes , I remembered everything . Duane said , " What are you doing here ? Are you begging , Lillian ? " I straightened my spine . " I am not begging . I am busking . I 'm playing a musical instrument in a public area for any money the citizens might wish to give . This is not a begging experience . This is a value-added street life experience for music lovers . " " Why are you doing it ? " " I like to play music . You know I was always musical . " Lonnie made a little sound . Duane said , " Why are you doing this really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , why else ? " " I see . " " What are you doing here ? " " Looking for my mother . " " What ? " " Lillian , we need to talk somewhere . " When I last saw him , his voice was a squeaky altar boy 's . Now it was smooth and pleasant , a sophisticated city man 's voice . " We 've got some heavy catching-up to do . " " Where do you live ? " " I moved back here last year from Fort Lauderdale , I 've got a place in Indian Village . " " And you came here to find your mother ? Where is she ? I mean , are you literally looking for her on the streets of Greektown , or is this some kind of theoretical quest , or what ? " " I 'm literally looking for her on the streets of Greektown . I have a very weird feeling , Lillian . Like I was meant to bump into you . You 've stayed in Detroit the whole time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It has to do with my mother . My mother and father . " " Did you ever come back to the old neighborhood after camp ? " " Whydo n't you know ? " Duane 's eyes cut right and left and he dropped his voice . " About my mom going crazy and disappearing ? While I was at camp ? " " My God . No ! " " Then three years later my dad took off , and I have n't seen him since . " " No ! " " Not that I give that much of a shit about him , frankly . But it occurs to me that I ought to talk to your mom and dad , about my mom and dad . I remember my mom gabbing on the phone to your mom and the two of them " " Duane , do n't you knowabout my mom and dad ? " His face settled into a mask of dread . I said , " They died that night . The night you went to camp . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Oh . My . God . "
