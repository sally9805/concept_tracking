Libby Day <br> Now <br> I have a meanness inside me , real as an organ . Slit me at my belly and it might slide out , meaty and dark , drop on the floor so you could stomp on it . It 's the Day blood . Something 's wrong with it . I was never a good little girl , and I got worse after the murders . Little Orphan Libby grew up sullen and boneless , shuffled around a group of lesser relatives  --  second cousins and great-aunts and friends of friends  --  stuck in a series of mobile homes or rotting ranch houses all across Kansas . Me going to school in my dead sisters ' hand-me-downs : Shirts with mustardy armpits . Pants with baggy bottoms , comically loose , held on with a raggedy belt cinched to the farthest hole . In class photos my hair was always crooked  --  barrettes hanging loosely from strands , as if they were airborne objects caught in the tangles  --  and I always had bulging pockets under my eyes , drunk-landlady eyes . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Maybe . <br> I was not a lovable child , and I 'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult . Draw a picture of my soul , and it 'd be a scribble with fangs . <br> It was miserable , wet-bone March and I was lying in bed thinking about killing myself , a hobby of mine . Indulgent afternoon daydreaming : A shotgun , my mouth , a bang and my head jerking once , twice , blood on the wall . Spatter , splatter . " Did she want to be buried or cremated ? " people would ask . " Who should come to the funeral ? " And no one would know . The people , whoever they were , would just look at each other 's shoes or shoulders until the silence settled in and then someone would put on a pot of coffee , briskly and with a fair amount of clatter . Coffee goes great with sudden death . <br> I pushed a foot out from under my sheets , but could n't bring myself to connect it to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I 've been depressed for about twenty-four years . I can feel a better version of me somewhere in there  --  hidden behind a liver or attached to a bit of spleen within my stunted , childish body  --  a Libby that 's telling me to get up , do something , grow up , move on . But the meanness usually wins out . My brother slaughtered my family when I was seven . My mom , two sisters , gone : bang bang , chop chop , choke choke . I did n't really have to do anything after that , nothing was expected . <br> I inherited $321,374 when I turned eighteen , the result of all those well-wishers who 'd read about my sad story , do-gooders whose hearts had gone out to me . Whenever I hear that phrase , and I hear it a lot , I picture juicy doodle-hearts , complete with bird-wings , flapping toward one of my many crap-ass childhood homes , my little-girl self at the window , waving and grabbing each bright heart , green cash sprinkling down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a kid , the donations were placed in a conservatively managed bank account , which , back in the day , saw a jump about every three  --  four years , when some magazine or news station ran an update on me . Little Libby 's Brand New Day : The Lone Survivor of the Prairie Massacre Turns a Bittersweet 10 . ( Me in scruffy pigtails on the possum-pissed lawn outside my Aunt Diane 's trailer . Diane 's thick tree-calves , exposed by a rare skirt , planted on the trailer steps behind me . ) Brave Baby Day 's Sweet 16 ! ( Me , still miniature , my face aglow with birthday candles , my shirt too tight over breasts that had gone D-cup that year , comic-book sized on my tiny frame , ridiculous , porny . ) <br> I 'd lived off that cash for more than thirteen years , but it was almost gone . I had a meeting that afternoon to determine exactly how gone . Once a year the man who managed the money , an unblinking , pink-cheeked banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " checkup , " he called it . We 'd eat something in the twenty-dollar range and talk about my life  --  he 'd known me since I was this-high , after all , heheh . As for me , I knew almost nothing about Jim Jeffreys , and never asked , viewing the appointments always from the same kid's-eye view : Be polite , but barely , and get it over with . Single-word answers , tired sighs . ( The one thing I suspected about Jim Jeffreys was that he must be Christian , churchy  --  he had the patience and optimism of someone who thought Jesus was watching . ) I was n't due for a " checkup " for another eight or nine months , but Jim Jeffreys had nagged , leaving phone messages in a serious , hushed voice , saying he 'd done all he could to extend the " life of the fund , " but it was time to think about " next steps . " <br> And here again came the meanness : I immediately thought about that other little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family the same year  --  1985 . She 'd had part of her face burned off in a fire her dad set that killed everyone else in her family . Any time I hit the ATM , I think of that Jamie girl , and how if she had n't stolen my thunder , I 'd have twice as much money . That Jamie Whatever was out at some mall with my cash , buying fancy handbags and jewelry and buttery department-store makeup to smooth onto her shiny , scarred face . Which was a horrible thing to think , of course . I at least knew that . <br> Finally , finally , finally I pulled myself out of bed with a stage- effect groan and wandered to the front of my house . I rent a small brick bungalow within a loop of other small brick bungalows , all of which squat on a massive bluff overlooking the former stockyards of Kansas City . Kansas City , Missouri , not Kansas City , Kansas . There 's a difference . <br> My neighborhood does n't even have a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There That Way . A weird , subprime area , full of dead ends and dog crap . The other bungalows are packed with old people who 've lived in them since they were built . The old people sit , gray and pudding-like , behind screen windows , peering out at all hours . Sometimes they walk to their cars on careful elderly tiptoes that make me feel guilty , like I should go help . But they would n't like that . They are not friendly old people  --  they are tight-lipped , pissed-off old people who do not appreciate me being their neighbor , this new person . The whole area hums with their disapproval . So there 's the noise of their disdain and there 's the skinny red dog two doors down who barks all day and howls all night , the constant background noise you do n't realize is driving you crazy until it stops , just a few blessed moments , and then starts up again . The neighborhood 's only cheerful sound I usually sleep through : the morning coos of toddlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some daycare hidden even farther in the rat 's nest of streets behind me , each clutching a section of a long piece of rope trailed by a grown-up . They march , penguin-style , past my house every morning , but I have not once seen them return . For all I know , they troddle around the entire world and return in time to pass my window again in the morning . Whatever the story , I am attached to them . There are three girls and a boy , all with a fondness for bright red jackets  --  and when I do n't seen them , when I oversleep , I actually feel blue . Bluer . That 'd be the word my mom would use , not something as dramatic as depressed . I 've had the blues for twenty-four years . <br> I put on a skirt and blouse for the meeting , feeling dwarfy , my grown-up , big-girl clothes never quite fitting . I 'm barely five foot  --  four foot , ten inches in truth , but I round up . Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to me in singsong , like they want to give me fingerpaints . <br> I headed down my weedy front slope , the neighbor 's red dog launching into its busybody barking . On the pavement near my car are the smashed skeletons of two baby birds , their flattened beaks and wings making them look reptilian . They 've been there for a year . I ca n't resist looking at them each time I get in my car . We need a good flood , wash them away . <br> Two elderly women were talking on the front steps of a house across the street , and I could feel them refusing to see me . I do n't know anyone 's name . If one of those women died , I could n't even say , " Poor old Mrs. Zalinsky died . " I 'd have to say , " That mean old bitch across the street bit it . " <br> Feeling like a child ghost , I climbed into my anonymous midsized car , which seems to be made mostly of plastic . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell me the obvious : " It 's a joke . You ca n't actually drive this . We were kidding . " I trance-drove my toy car ten minutes downtown to meet Jim Jeffreys , rolling into the steakhouse parking lot twenty minutes late , knowing he 'd smile all kindly and say nothing about my tardiness . <br> I was supposed to call him from my cell phone when I arrived so he could trot out and escort me in . The restaurant  --  a great , old-school KC steakhouse  --  is surrounded by hollowed-out buildings that concern him , as if a troop of rapists were permanently crouched in their empty husks awaiting my arrival . Jim Jeffreys is not going to be The Guy Who Let Something Bad Happen to Libby Day . Nothing bad can happen to BRAVE BABY DAY , LITTLE GIRL LOST , the pathetic , red-headed seven-year-old with big blue eyes , the only one who survived the PRAIRIE MASSACRE , the KANSAS CRAZE-KILLINGS , the FARMHOUSE SATAN SACRIFICE . My mom , two older sisters , all butchered by Ben . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer . I was the cutie-pie who brought my Devil- worshiping brother to justice . I was big news . The Enquirer put my tearful photo on the front page with the headline ANGEL FACE . <br> I peered into the rearview mirror and could see my baby face even now . My freckles were faded , and my teeth straightened , but my nose was still pug and my eyes kitten-round . I dyed my hair now , a white-blonde , but the red roots had grown in . It looked like my scalp was bleeding , especially in the late-day sunlight . It looked gory . I lit a cigarette . I 'd go for months without smoking , and then remember : I need a cigarette . I 'm like that , nothing sticks . <br> " Let 's go , Baby Day , " I said aloud . It 's what I call myself when I 'm feeling hateful . <br> I got out of the car and smoked my way toward the restaurant , holding the cigarette in my right hand so I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . It was almost evening : Migrant clouds floated in packs across the sky like buffalo , and the sun was just low enough to spray everything pink . Toward the river , between the looping highway ramps , obsolete grain elevators sat vacant , dusk-black and pointless . <br> I walked across the parking lot all by myself , atop a constellation of crushed glass . I was not attacked . It was , after all , just past 5 p.m . Jim Jeffreys was an early-bird eater , proud of it . <br> He was sitting at the bar when I walked in , sipping a pop , and the first thing he did , as I knew he would , was grab his cell phone from his jacket pocket and stare at it as if it had betrayed him . <br> " Did you call ? " he frowned . <br> " No , I forgot , " I lied . <br> He smiled then . " Well , anyway . Anyway , I 'm glad you 're here , sweetheart . Ready to talk turkey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maneuvered us over to a red leather booth sprouting yellow stuffing from its cracks . The broken slits scraped the backs of my legs as I slid in . A whoof of cigarette stink burped out of the cushions . <br> Jim Jeffreys never drank liquor in front of me , and never asked me if I wanted a drink , but when the waiter came I ordered a glass of red wine and watched him try not to look surprised , or disappointed , or anything but Jim Jeffreys  --  like . What kind of red ? the waiter asked , and I had no idea , really  --  I never could remember the names of reds or whites , or which part of the name you were supposed to say out loud , so I just said , House . He ordered a steak , I ordered a double-stuffed baked potato , and then the waiter left and Jim Jeffreys let out a long dentist-y sigh and said , " Well , Libby , we are entering a very new and different stage here together . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking saytenthousandsayten thousand . <br> " Do you read those reports I send you ? " <br> " I sometimes do , " I lied again . I liked getting mail but not reading it ; the reports were probably in a pile somewhere in my house . <br> " Have you listened to my messages ? " <br> " I think your cell phone is messed up . It cuts out a lot . " I 'd listened just long enough to know I was in trouble . I usually tuned out after Jim Jeffreys ' first sentence , which always began : Your friend Jim Jeffreys here , Libby . . . <br> Jim Jeffreys steepled his fingers and stuck his bottom lip out . " There is 982 dollars and 12 cents left in the fund . As I 've mentioned before , had you been able to replenish it with any kind of regular work , we 'd have been able to keep it afloat , but . . . " he tossed out his hands and grimaced , " things did n't work out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
