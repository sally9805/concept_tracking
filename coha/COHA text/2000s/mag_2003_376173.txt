The new Photoshop Album 2.0 ( $50 ) makes it easier to keep digital pictures in order . First it locates them all  --  even if they are scattered in various folders on your PC . The Calendar View setting enables you to find photos by month , year or day they were saved . And the Auto Fix feature enables you to adjust the color and brightness of an entire group of pictures with a single click .  --  By Anita Hamilton
