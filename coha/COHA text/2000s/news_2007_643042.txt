<p> The Anaheim Ducks used to have an animated Tinkerbell that fluttered across the scoreboard and sprinkled pixie dust onto pictures of players ' heads . <p> Tinkerbell can not possibly recognize her team anymore . The Ducks have essentially traded pixie dust on the head for punches to the face . <p> " We fight , " Anaheim General Manager Brian Burke said . " It 's what we do . We put a premium on it . " <p> Burke may not sound politically correct , but he is refreshingly honest . While the National Hockey League has restricted contact and condemned violence , the Ducks have proved that fighting still works  --  both as a promotional tool and a strategic technique . <p> The Ducks won the Pacific Division this season for the first time , and as they prepare to open the Stanley Cup playoffs Wednesday night against Minnesota , they are giving most of the credit to their knuckles . <p> They do not apologize for their 1,457 penalty minutes , which led the N.H.L. Nor do they apologize for their 71 fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , they defend themselves with both fists raised . <p> " The night before you play our team , it 's a little nerve-racking , " Anaheim forward Brad May said . " You sleep with the lights on . " <p> It is still hard to be intimidated by a franchise called the Ducks , especially since they were named after a fuzzy Disney movie . But look around the Honda Center  --  formerly known as the Pond  --  and you may find a few scattered teeth . <p> The Ducks were founded in 1993 , not as a fight club , but as a marketing arm for the Walt Disney Company and a source of family entertainment in Orange County . If they happened to win a few hockey games along the way , it was almost a bonus . <p> Then Disney sold the team two years ago to Henry and Susan Samueli , an Orange County couple . With input from fans , the Ducks junked their purple-and-teal uniforms for black and gold . They traded their duck-billed logo for a bold script . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ducks started to retaliate . Hockey in Orange County became as serious as a stiff-arm . <p> " Other players come in now and look at our lineup and you know what they 're thinking , " forward Shawn Thornton said . " Let 's keep it quiet and get out of here . " <p> The team is no longer named the Mighty Ducks , perhaps because they do not need to convince anyone of their might . Anaheim demonstrates its muscle the old-fashioned way . <p> By dropping their gloves at the drop of a helmet , enforcers explain that they are protecting star players , allowing them to skate without fear . The Ducks ' top scorers , Teemu Selanne and Andy McDonald , responded this season with a combined 75 goals . <p> The last time Anaheim made the Stanley Cup finals , in 2003 , McDonald had to sit out because of post-concussion syndrome and the Ducks lost to the Devils . When the Chicago Blackhawks hammered McDonald during a game this season , three Anaheim players took turns rushing to his defense . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , " McDonald said . " You know that you 've got 22 guys waiting to stand up for you . It 's a good set-up for someone like me . " <p> McDonald is sometimes overshadowed by his bodyguards . Anaheim forward George Parros racked up 18 fighting majors this season , the most in the N.H.L. , and he grew a bushy black mustache , the envy of enforcers everywhere . <p> The ' stache , as Parros calls it , has become so fashionable in Orange County that fans tape black whiskers to their upper lips before games . Parros , who graduated from Princeton with a major in economics , can only imagine the marketing possibilities . <p> " People are always calling me a meathead , a dummy , telling me I 'm too stupid to be a real player , " Parros said . " I guess they do n't know where I went to college . " <p> Parros seems as unlikely a fighter as Burke does a fighting advocate . Burke , a graduate of Harvard Law School , used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also general manager of Vancouver when Todd Bertuzzi played for the Canucks and punched Colorado 's Steven Moore from behind and slammed him to the ice in 2004 . <p> Moore fractured three vertebrae in his neck , but Burke stood by his player . Since then , many executives have tried to distance themselves from fighting . Burke has cast himself as the voice of the pugilist . He stands out only in his candor . <p> " The people who are in the game  --  the players , coaches , fans  --  they all want fighting , " Burke said . " The debate is always started by outsiders . I 'm sick of it . " <p> Burke has done his best to keep tough guys employed . While many teams in the salary-cap era play without a heavyweight , opting for skill over strength , the Ducks have four legitimate enforcers on their roster . <p> Those four bruisers  --  May , Parros , Thornton and Travis Moen  --  are not exactly Philadelphia 's Broad Street Bullies of the 1970s . But in the modern N.H.L. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as rugged as it gets . <p> " Every rose has thorns , " May said . " We 're the thorns . " <p> Sitting in their dressing room , the Ducks are as likely to be talking about right hooks as wrist shots . They monitor the Web site hockeyfights.com , which features penalty statistics that the N.H.L. does not always publish . Parros and Thornton take boxing lessons in the summer to hone their craft . <p> " If I did n't learn how to do this , I probably would have been sent home a long time ago , " Thornton said . " Even now , if I were on another team , I do n't know that I 'd be in the N.H.L. " <p> The Ducks insist that they are not trying to reverse the trend against fighting . They are only trying to win their first Stanley Cup , regardless of the collateral damage . <p> In the playoffs , fights are rare . Teams are careful not to commit penalties and give up unnecessary power plays . One of Anaheim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ducks went all the way to the Western Conference finals last season , and they did not exactly leave peacefully . <p> " We fought in the first round , the second round and the third round , " Burke said . " And if we got to the finals , we would have fought there , too . " ##
