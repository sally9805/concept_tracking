Katie Zucker , 16 , has sky blue eyes , wild curly hair and a dazzling smile . She is a champion equestrian and an A student . Her parents are doting , her friends devoted . So what 's not to envy ? Well , there 's the small rectangular box attached to her belt that pumps insulin through a tube into her hip . To test her blood , she pricks her finger seven times a day . " It 's scary , " she says . " If your blood sugar goes too low , you could go into a coma . " Sometimes at school her eyes swell , and she ca n't see the blackboard . She knows that her diabetes can result in kidney failure , amputation and blindness . But mostly , she says , " I try to think it wo n't affect me too much in the future . " <P> If there 's any hope for a cure for Zucker and more than 1 million other Americans with Type 1 diabetes , the most debilitating form of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research based on manipulating human embryonic stem cells . These building blocks of life , when isolated in a microscopic cluster of cells , can morph into any kind of tissue . ( So-called adult stem cells , which can be harvested without sacrificing embryos , can turn into only a few tissue types . ) One day , scientists hope , the entire genetic makeup of a patient like Zucker could be transferred into a cloned human egg that can produce the insulin-producing cells her body lacks . <P> But some religious groups believe the clumps of 100 to 200 cells from which embryonic stem cells are taken represent a potential human life as worthy of protection as any child 's . Three years ago , President George W. Bush , under pressure from both sides , adopted a compromise that ended up choking off most federal research funds to the field . He said at the time that although the research offered " great promise " in saving lives , it could lead to " growing human beings for spare body parts . " <P> Today a brush-fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , fueled by the frustration of such families as Zucker 's who have allied themselves with patient activists for other diseases , major universities , several state legislatures and members of Congress . Last month 206 U.S. Representatives wrote to the President , calling on him to fund stem-cell research on spare embryos from a pool of some 400,000 stored in the freezers of in vitro fertilization clinics . These embryos , only a few days old and smaller than the head of a pin , will probably be discarded unless they are donated to science . Embryonic stem cells , the letter noted , can be used to treat " diseases that affect more than 100 million Americans , such as cancer , heart disease , diabetes , Parkinson 's , Alzheimer 's , multiple sclerosis , spinal cord injury ... " The signatories included two dozen pro-life Republicans .
