It has become an election-year tradition . Every four years state governments hold their presidential primaries earlier and earlier , trying to ensure that their voters get to influence the race before most candidates drop out . Next year six states are planning to hold primaries a week after New Hampshire 's . And four weeks later the nomination will probably be all but locked up . But the front-loading of the primary season is having an unintended effect . Some states , frustrated at not having any influence on the nomination and trying to save money , are dropping out . Three states  --  Colorado , Utah and Kansas  --  have canceled their primaries for next year . Missouri and Tennessee are considering doing the same . In 2000 George W. Bush effectively secured the nomination after only nine states had voted . Al Gore was the victor after only two primaries . By the time Missouri voted March 7 , turnout was just 19% . With a $1 billion budget gap forcing state workers to unscrew every third light bulb to save on electricity , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make sense . Politics is also a consideration . The three states that have canceled their primaries have Republican-controlled legislatures . With Bush assured the G.O.P. nomination , they see no reason to spend millions on a primary that will give more exposure to Democrats . The loser in all this is the voter . In states that ax primaries , the parties will return to older methods of choosing a candidate  --  caucuses or conventions  --  for next year 's campaign . " Most voters are not going to take a day off and go to a party caucus , " says University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato . " That guarantees most wo n't have a voice .
