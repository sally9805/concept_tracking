In the tattered , cargo-strewn cabin of an Ariana Afghan Airlines passenger jet streaking above Punjab toward Kabul sat a stocky , broad-faced American with short graying hair . He was a friendly man in his early fifties who spoke in a flat midwestern accent . He looked as if he might be a dentist , an acquaintance once remarked . Gary Schroen had served for twenty-six years as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency 's clandestine services . He was now , in September 1996 , chief of station in Islamabad , Pakistan . He spoke Persian and its cousin , Dari , one of Afghanistan 's two main languages . In spy terminology , Schroen was an operator . He recruited and managed paid intelligence agents , conducted espionage operations , and supervised covert actions against foreign governments and terrorist groups . A few weeks before , with approval from CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , he had made contact through intermediaries with Ahmed Shah Massoud , the celebrated anti-Soviet guerrilla commander , now defense minister in a war-battered Afghan government crumbling from within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted . // They had not spoken in five years . During the late 1980s and early 1990s , as allies battling Soviet occupation forces and their Afghan communist proxies , the CIA had pumped cash stipends as high as $200,000 a month to Massoud and his Islamic guerrilla organization , along with weapons and other supplies . Between 1989 and 1991 , Schroen had personally delivered some of the cash . But the aid stopped in December 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved . The United States government decided it had no further interests in Afghanistan . // Meanwhile , the country had collapsed . Kabul , once an elegant city of broad streets and walled gardens tucked spectacularly amid barren crags , had been pummelled by its warlords into a state of physical ruin and human misery that compared unfavorably to the very worst places on Earth . Armed factions within armed factions erupted seasonally in vicious urban battles , blasting down mud-brick block after mud-brick block in search of tactical advantages usually apparent only to them . Militias led by Islamic scholars who disagreed profoundly over religious minutia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded metal shipping containers . The city had been without electricity since 1993 . Hundreds of thousands of Kabulis relied for daily bread and tea on the courageous but limited efforts of international charities . In some sections of the countryside thousands of displaced refugees died of malnutrition and preventable disease because they could not reach clinics and feeding stations . And all the while neighboring countries-Pakistan , Iran , India , Saudi Arabia-delivered pallets of guns and money to their preferred Afghan proxies . The governments of these countries sought territorial advantage over their neighbors . Money and weapons also arrived from individuals or Islamic charities seeking to extend their spiritual and political influence by proselytizing to the destitute . // Ahmed Shah Massoud remained Afghanistan 's most formidable military leader . A sinewy man with a wispy beard and penetrating dark eyes , he had be come a charismatic popular leader , especially in northeastern Afghanistan . There he had fought and negotiated with equal imagination during the 1980s , punishing and frustrating Soviet generals . Massoud saw politics and war as intertwined . He was an attentive student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time passed if he could imagine a life without guerrilla conflict . Yet through various councils and coalitions , he had also proven able to acquire power by sharing it . During the long horror of the Soviet occupation , Massoud had symbolized for many Afghans-especially his own Tajik people-the spirit and potential of their brave resistance . He was above all an independent man . He surrounded himself with books . He prayed piously , read Persian poetry , studied Islamic theology , and immersed himself in the history of guerrilla warfare . He was drawn to the doctrines of revolutionary and political Islam , but he had also established himself as a broad-minded , tolerant Afghan nationalist . // That September 1996 , Massoud 's reputation had fallen to a low ebb , however . His passage from rebellion during the 1980s to governance in the 1990s had evolved disastrously . After the collapse of Afghan communism he had joined Kabul 's newly triumphant but unsettled Islamic coalition as its defense minister . Attacked by rivals armed in Pakistan , Massoud counterattacked , and as he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . His allies to the north smuggled heroin . He was unable to unify or pacify the country . His troops showed poor discipline . Some of them mercilessly massacred rivals while battling for control of Kabul neighborhoods. // Promising to cleanse the nation of its warlords , including Massoud , a new militia movement swept from Afghanistan 's south beginning in 1994 . Its turbaned , eye-shadowed leaders declared that the Koran would slay the Lion of Panjshir , as Massoud was known , where other means had failed . // They traveled behind white banners raised in the name of an unusually severe school of Islam that promoted lengthy and bizarre rules of personal conduct . These Taliban , or students , as they called themselves , now controlled vast areas of southern and western Afghanistan . Their rising strength shook Massoud . The Taliban traveled in shiny new Toyota double-cab pickup trucks . They carried fresh weapons and ample ammunition . Mysteriously , they repaired and flew former Soviet fighter aircraft , despite only rudimentary military experience among their leaders . // The U.S. embassy in Kabul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there was no CIA station in Afghanistan from which to collect intelligence about the Taliban or the sources of their newfound strength . The nearest station , in Pakistan , no longer had Afghanistan on its Operating Directive , the official list of intelligence-gathering priorities transmitted from Washington each year to CIA stations worldwide . Without the formal blessing of the O.D. , as it was called , a station chief like Gary Schroen lacked the budgetary resources needed to recruit agents , supply them with communications gear , manage them in the field , and process their intelligence reports . // The CIA maintained a handful of paid agents in Afghanistan , but these were dedicated to tracking down Mir Amal Kasi , a young and angry Pakistani who on January 25 , 1993 , had opened fire on CIA employees arriving at the agency 's Langley headquarters . Kasi had killed two and wounded three , and then fled to Pakistan . By 1996 he was believed to be moving back and forth to Afghanistan , taking refuge in tribal areas where American police and spies could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not report on the Taliban 's developing war against Ahmed Shah Massoud except in passing . The job of collecting intelligence about political and military developments in Afghanistan had been assigned to CIA headquarters in faraway Virginia , lumped in with the general responsibilities of the Near East Division of the Directorate of Operations . // This was hardly an unusual development among U.S. government agencies . The U.S. Agency for International Development had shut down its Afghan humanitarian assistance program in 1994 . The Pentagon had no relationships there . The National Security Council at the White House had no Afghan policy beyond a vague wish for peace and prosperity . The State Department was more involved in Afghan affairs , but only at the middle levels of its bureaucracy . Secretary of State Warren Christopher had barely commented about Afghanistan during his four years in office . // Massoud sent a close adviser named Massoud Khalili to escort Gary Schroen into Kabul . To make room for cargo desperately needed in the land locked capital , Ariana Afghan had ripped most of the passenger seats out of their airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them strapped down or secured . " It 's never crashed before , " Khalili assured Schroen. // Their jet swept above barren russet ridges folded one upon the other as it crossed into Afghanistan . The treeless land below lay mottled in palettes of sand brown and clay red . To the north , ink black rivers cut plunging gorges through the Hindu Kush Mountains . To the south , eleven-thousand-foot peaks rose in a ring above the Kabul valley , itself more than a mile high . The plane banked toward Bagram , a military air base north of Kabul . Along the surrounding roads lay rusting carcasses of tanks and armored personnel carriers , burned and abandoned . Fractured shells of fighter aircraft and transport planes lined the runway . // Officers in Massoud 's intelligence service met the plane with four-wheel-drive vehicles , packed their American visitor inside , and began the bone-jarring drive across the Shomali Plain to Kabul . It amazed some of them that Schroen had turned up with just a small bag tossed over his shoulder-no communications gear , no personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detailed knowledge of Afghanistan impressed them . // Then , too , Schroen had been known to turn up in the past with bags full of American dollars . In that respect he and his CIA colleagues could be easy men for Afghan fighters to like . For sixteen years now the CIA had routinely pursued its objectives in Afghanistan with large boxes of cash . It frustrated some of Massoud 's intelligence officers that the CIA always seemed to think Massoud and his men were motivated by money . // Their civil war might be complex and vicious , but they saw themselves as fighters for a national cause , bleeding and dying by the day , risking what little they had . Enough untraceable bills had flowed to Massoud 's organization over the years to assure their comfortable retirements if they wished . Yet many of them were still here in Kabul still at Massoud 's side , despite the severe risks and deprivations . Some of them wondered resentfully why the CIA often seemed to treat them as if money mattered more than kin and country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash , either . // They delivered Gary Schroen to one of the half-dozen unmarked safehouses Massoud maintained in Kabul . They waited for the commander 's summons , which came about an hour before midnight . They met in a house that had once been the residence of Austria 's ambassador , before rocketing and gun battles had driven most of Europe 's diplomats away . // Massoud wore a white Afghan robe and a round , soft , wool Panjshiri cap . He was a tall man , but not physically imposing . He was quiet and formal , yet he radiated intensity . His attendant poured tea . They sat in dim light around a makeshift conference table . Massoud chatted in Dari with Khalili about their visitor , his back ground , what Khalili knew of him . // Massoud sounded skeptical about the CIA 's request for this meeting . The agency had ignored what Massoud and his men saw as the rising threat posed by the radical Taliban . There were some in Massoud 's circle who suspected that the CIA had secretly passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend to Massoud over the years , but a fickle friend . What did the agency want now ? // " You and I have a history , although we never met face to face , " Schroen began . He was not going to make accusations , but in truth , it was not an altogether happy history . // In the winter of 1990 , Schroen reminded Massoud , the CIA had been working closely with the commander . Massoud operated then in the mountains of northeastern Afghanistan . Kabul was controlled by President Najibullah , a beefy , mustached former secret police chief and communist who clung to power despite the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989 . Moscow backed Najibullah ; U.S. policy sought his defeat by military force . The Soviets supplied vast amounts of military and economic aid to their client by road and air . Working with Pakistan 's military intelligence service , the CIA had come up with a plan that winter to launch simultaneous attacks on key supply lines around Afghanistan . CIA officers had mapped a crucial role for Massoud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main north-south road leading from the Soviet Union to Kabul . // In January of 1990 , Gary Schroen had traveled to Peshawar , Pakistan . One of Massoud 's brothers , Ahmed Zia , maintained a compound there with a radio connection to Massoud 's northeastern headquarters . Schroen spoke on the radio with Massoud about the CIA 'S attack plan . The agency wanted Massoud to drive west and shut down the Salang Highway for the winter . // Massoud agreed but said he needed financial help . He would have to purchase fresh ammunition and winter clothing for his troops . He needed to move villagers away from the area of the attacks so they would not be vulnerable to retaliation from government forces . To pay for all this , Massoud wanted a large payment over and above his monthly CIA stipend . Schroen and the commander agreed on a one-time lump sum of $500,000 in cash . Schroen soon delivered the money by hand to Massoud 's brother in Peshawar . // Weeks passed . There were a few minor skirmishes , and the Salang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopened . As far as the CIA could determine , Massoud had not put any of his main forces into action as they had agreed he would . CIA officers involved suspected they had been ripped off for half a million dollars . The Salang was a vital source of commerce and revenue for civilians in northern Afghanistan , and Massoud in the past had been reluctant to close the road down , fearing he would alienate his local followers . Massoud 's forces also earned taxes along the road . // In later exchanges with CIA officers , Massoud defended himself , saying his subcommanders had initiated the planned attacks as agreed that winter , but they had been stalled by weather and other problems . The CIA could find no evidence to support Massoud 's account . As far as they could tell , Massoud 's commanders had simply not participated in the battles along the Salang. // Schroen now reminded Massoud about their agreement six years earlier , and he mentioned that he had personally handed over $500,000 to Massoud 's brother . // " How much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Schroen replied . // Massoud and his aides began to talk among themselves . One of them quietly said in Dari , " We did n't get $500,000. " // Massoud repeated his earlier defense to Schroen . The weather in that winter of 1990 had been awful . He could n't move his troops as successfully as he had hoped . He lacked adequate ammunition , despite the big payment . // " That 's all history , " Schroen finally said . // Massoud voiced his own complaints . He was a deliberate , cogent speaker , clear and forceful , never loud or demonstrative . The CIA and the United States had walked away from Afghanistan , leaving its people bereft , he said . //
