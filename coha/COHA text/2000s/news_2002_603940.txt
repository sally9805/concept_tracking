<p> WASHINGTON  --  A day after naming a new Treasury secretary , President Bush moved to restore a sense of mission to the Securities and Exchange Commission by announcing Wall Street veteran William Donaldson as his choice to be the next SEC chairman . <p> If confirmed by the Senate , Donaldson 's appointment will close the book on the stormy reign of Harvey Pitt at the SEC . Pitt , a brilliant securities lawyer who took over the agency in August 2001 , announced his resignation Nov. 5 , less than two weeks after an acrimonious dispute over the appointment of former FBI director William Webster to an accounting oversight board divided the commission along party lines . <p> One of Donaldson 's first acts Tuesday , before Bush announced his selection in a White House press conference , was to call each of the commissioners . That shrewd political sense has been missing at the SEC and may be helpful as the agency faces unprecedented tests arising from months of business scandals . <p> " As a personality , Donaldson 's almost the opposite of Harvey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Columbia University . " He 's a consensus builder ; he 's naturally warm and does n't have the combative side or the tendency to appear arrogant that Mr. Pitt had . " <p> Donaldson boasts an impressive resume . Together with two friends , he founded the first research firm specializing in in-depth investment research , Donaldson Lufkin &; Jenrette in 1959 . In the 1970s , he worked in the Nixon and Ford administrations , where many other members of the current Bush administration started their Washington service . <p> His most recent business experience came two years ago at Aetna , where he was installed as CEO after the ouster of blunt-speaking Richard Huber . His experience in smoothing over some of Aetna 's strained business relationships should help him at the SEC , where he will inherit a full plate of problems . <p> In the past year , accounting scandals at Enron , WorldCom and other companies have challenged the SEC 's enforcement division . Since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed last summer , the SEC is also charged with making new rules regulating the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The first test of Donaldson 's skills will come early in his tenure , when he helps decide who should replace Webster as head of the accounting oversight board . <p> " Confidence in the U.S. corporate and financial industries has been seriously eroded during the past few years , " Donaldson said during his White House appearance with Bush . " Restoring the confidence of investors in the integrity of the markets is the responsibility of all of us . " <p> Everyone involved in the financial markets , from boards of directors to lawyers and accountants , " must be constantly mindful of the trust that shareholders have placed in them , " he said . <p> When faced with challenges , Donaldson is fond of telling people that on his first day working at the State Department in 1973 as undersecretary for energy policy , war broke out in the Middle East . <p> Wars of a different kind are being waged at the SEC now . The challenges that face Donaldson include : <p> * Low morale . Years of financial neglect have left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffers and professionals unionized . Although the union offers staffers a forum for pursuing grievances , it has n't solved the issue of chronic overwork . <p> " Morale is at its lowest point , " says Michael Clampitt , a lawyer in the corporate finance division who helped organize the union . " This place is a shambles of what it was 10 or 12 years ago . " <p> * Lack of funding . Over the past decade , the SEC 's annual budget has grown incrementally , while the financial markets it is supposed to police have exploded in size . Earlier this year , after the meltdowns at Enron and WorldCom , the Sarbanes-Oxley Act called for the SEC 's annual budget to be almost doubled , from $ 438 million to $ 776 million . The White House instead stuck with a more modest increase , to $ 568 million , sparking criticism that the Bush administration was n't serious about implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley reforms . <p> During Tuesday 's introduction of Donaldson , Bush vowed to increase funding for the SEC for the 2004 fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its $ 568 million target for 2003 , then raise the budget to $ 876 million the following year . <p> * Outmoded technology . One of Pitt 's achievements this year was his decree that the CEOs and chief financial officers of the nation 's top 945 companies sign off on financial statements . But when his staff tried to compile a list of the top American companies , they had to crib from a copy of the Fortune 1,000 . The SEC does n't even have the database technology to compile such a list internally , even though the vast majority of the top thousand file their earnings statements with the agency . <p> * The politicization of the SEC . Despite a spate of public relations problems that dogged him during his tenure , Pitt 's job seemed safe until October , when the commission was required by Sarbanes-Oxley to choose five directors to head the accounting board . <p> In September , Pitt seemed to be leaning toward naming John Biggs , head of the pension investment fund TIAA-CREF , as chairman of the new panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidacy . By late October , Pitt had settled on Webster . On Oct. 25 , a bitterly divided SEC voted 3-2 to install Webster in the job . <p> Less than a week later , in response to a New York Times story , Pitt admitted to his fellow commissioners that he had n't told them everything about Webster 's past , including his stint as head of the audit committee at a company called U.S. Technologies . Webster fired the company 's accounting firm after it had suggested that the company 's internal financial controls were lacking . The revelation sparked outrage and led to Pitt 's resignation , as well as Webster 's . <p> After the Webster debacle , finding Pitt 's replacement became a top priority for the Bush administration . Staffers in the White House wanted someone they could rely on to run the SEC smoothly , avoiding the public relations problems Pitt seemed to find . They also wanted someone with enough public stature to help restore confidence in the stock market . <p> " I think he 's Mr. Clean , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been a scandal under his watch . " <p> Donaldson is unlikely to be formally nominated before January , meaning that Senate approval might not come until February . Given the need for a strong leader at the SEC , Donaldson is likely to win Senate approval , but his confirmation path wo n't be smooth . <p> Rep. Michael Oxley , R-Ohio , issued a statement in support of Donaldson . Rep. John Dingell , D-Mich. , and Sen. Jon Corzine , D-N.J. , expressed hope that Donaldson would prove to be a strong leader at the SEC . <p> But Sen. Paul Sarbanes , D-Md. , the principal author of last summer 's corporate reform act , promised that during Donaldson 's confirmation process , his record would be " carefully examined and his views on the challenges facing the SEC fully reviewed . " <p> Sen. Richard Shelby , R-Ala. , who will head the Senate 's banking committee , said he would try to move the confirmation process ahead quickly . <p> The road to Donaldson 's confirmation could have some speed bumps . In 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donaldson was paid $ 1 million in salary and awarded a bonus of $ 6 million . Even though he stepped down from the top job at Aetna , he is named in a shareholder class-action suit that has been filed against the company . <p> Corporate governance watchdogs might object to his nomination . Shareholder activist Robert Monks criticized Donaldson in 1992 , when Donaldson was CEO of the New York Stock Exchange . In a letter , Monks said he was " disappointed " with the NYSE 's lax proposal to curb the practice of exchange offers , through which companies can influence votes by giving common stockholders bonds or preferred stock . Monks also said the NYSE was too lenient in letting lawyers , consultants and investment bankers who collect fees from companies be considered independent directors . <p> Donaldson told Institutional Investor last year that he was against Regulation FD ( fair disclosure ) , which forbids officers of publicly traded companies from sharing important information with analysts without disseminating it to the public at large . <p> But his past wo n't necessarily determine the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a strong advocate for the individual investor as SEC chief in the 1990s , came out of the industry he was charged with regulating . <p> " Whether he turns out to be a good chair or not depends on what he does , as opposed to who he is or what he says , " says Lynn Turner , director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State and former chief accountant under Levitt . " Every new chairman coming in has the opportunity to be very good or very bad . He 'll write his own legacy .
