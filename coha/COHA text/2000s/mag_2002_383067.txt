She 's had a few husbands . And she knows a few Of things about marital bliss ( and marital misery ) . Below , MARGO HOWARD shares her hard-won wisdom . // it would be fair to characterize my marital history as " never a bridesmaid , always a bride . " To be perfectly candid , I am a rice-scarred veteran who 's lost three husbands . In divorce court . Which , if you think about it , makes me the perfect person to speak about the subject at hand . My qualifications obviously do not come from being successful right out of the gate . Rather , I know what I know from experience and , of course , observation . ( I know you 're too polite to ask , but yes , there is a Mr. Right No. 4 . And no , we 're not married , at least not yet . ) So for anybody who 's up for a few hints on domestic harmony , I offer you the benefit of having spent a grand total of 27 blissful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , the one in the middle , and the most recent ex . Let us begin . Triumph over premature articulation Hold your fire and your tongue . Do not belittle him . Be big about it , whatever " it " is . Mistakes in judgment and actions are part of the human comedy , and you dot score points by pointing out every misstep . I have to remind myself of this weekly , in parking garages all over town , where my beloved has neglected to make a note ( mental or actual ) of where the car is parked . What stops me from remarking on the lost car during our wanderings is that he already knows the car is lost . In this same vein , hold off from immediately responding to things you regard as a bad idea . Sometimes a harebrained scheme will evaporate into the ether without your having to say a word . By passing up the chance to be judge and jury , you wo n't wind up playing the role of Critical Warden . And down the line you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A phrase that I grew up hearing from my mother reverberates still : " You do n't have to say everything you 're thinking . " Unfortunately , I neglected to take this piece of advice ... on more than one occasion . Once in the ring , let your best self referee When tempers are at the boiling point , there are two things you should try mightily not to say . One is " You never .... " The other is " You always .... " These will only elicit a defensive response ( and in all probability , the original statement will not be true ) . Any neutral party who hears , for example , " You never listen " or " You always have to have it your way " would be correct in thinking , Oh , brother , these people are n't gon na get anywhere . The " you never/you always " gambit leaves the attackee nowhere to go . What is more productive than painting him into a corner is helping him get out of the doghouse . All that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the need to be right . Sometimes a girl just needs a secret decoder ring I ca n't count the number of girlfriends who bemoan the fact that their guys can no longer get out the words Hove you the way they did in the early days . If other things in a relationship are in good working order , this declaration should not be considered a greatly important item . The gestures that say " I love you " are worth more than the words . I used to get extremely annoyed at all the husbands for not wanting to have a gabfest about every little thing . Then I figured out it 's not what they do . If love is blind , why is lingerie so popular ? Clothes that are sorts sexy , at the appropriate times , are fun and make the statement that you do n't take him for granted-and that you have n't stopped trying to keep , the furnace stoked . Truly , in a mature marriage , the man is not lamenting that his dream girl does n't have 4 her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his own belt ) . There is also a gravitydefying stunt you may not be aware of . Lying down actually does improve a girl 's figure . It 's easier to ride a horse in the direction it 's going Some things are just not worth a grand mal rant . Do n't gripe about the toilet seat or dropped socks if you have already asked him a thousand times to correct what are apparently genetic male traits . Or , if he 's given to falling asleep in front of the television , cover him up . That seems to be a guy thing , too , and unworthy of a courtmartial . Just think of the snoring as foreplay . Joan Rivers stayed up way too long Many ministers and rabbis advise couples to never go to bed mad . Ms. Rivers , years ago , took note of this ... but added that she and Edgar once stayed up for three weeks straight . It is majorly important to let grievances fade into the woodwork . It is punishing and does not advance the game to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , now famous in my group of girlfriends , about one of our number who was having all kinds of marital problems some years ago . She took a chance and laid everything out for her famously man-of-few-words brother . She talked for 45 minutes . Then she asked him , " Well , what do you think I should do ? " " Do n't dwell on it , " he answered . Underneath his silly ( if hilarious ) bromide was a crazy kind of wisdom . And as a bonus , a whole gang of friends is always saying to one another now , " Do n't dwell on it ! " What you see is what you get Expectations can be a pothole . Unrealistic ones can kill a marriage . Your parents ' relationship , no matter how happy , will not be duplicated . And though human chemistry can be modestly altered , it is women , alas , who seem to do most of the lab work , changing their own behavior . Many a disappointed female has imagined that her fella would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant once they walked down the aisle . Which is why making peace with what is is crucial to a successful partnership . In fact , the guy you marry is almost always the guy you get . ( Sadly , I was not paying close attention to this truism. ) // Wake up ! Wake up ! Were someone to shake me awake in the middle of the night and say I must choose one thing to tell a woman to do ( or not do ) in her marriage , it would be this : Do not , repeat , do notpoint out to your husband unattractive things about his parents , his sibs , or his children ( if they 're not yours ) . He already knows them . Odds are that his parents/sibs/children are as painful/ annoying/destructive to him as they are to you . If you do let it all hang out , a subtie kind of displacement will occur . He will take the unhappiness he feels about the unpleasant family member and subconsciously slide the bad feelings onto you . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becoming hostile to the messenger because there is really nothing to be done about the actual irritant . Let 's say your husband 's mother is a fan dancer and a nonstop talker . Restrain yourself from discoursing on the subject , because it will not take away her fans , nor will it make her any less fond of the sound of her own voice . If your guy should be willing to discuss his disappointment with one of his family members , tread gingerly and compassionately . ( And listening is better than talking . ) Legos for grown-ups Apologies and admissions are great building blocks in a marriage ; though for some reason , women seem more comfortable with them than men do . It is worth remembering that you do n't lose ground by demonstrating a willingness to look at yourself in an objective and self-critical way . Just as an apology is disarming , so is the announcement , " My performance yesterday was not the greatest . I can do better . I probably should n't have thrown out your 78 's just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the CD player . " My favorite secret weapon Well , it is n't really a weapon , and it 's certainly not a secret , but you ca n't get through life , let alone a marriage , without humor , the pressure valve that makes everything possible and tolerable and fim . The ability to laugh at yourself , at him , and at whatever situation you 're in is really one of the good parts of being a couple . Get in your time machine Everyone knows that courtship and romance is a different game than kids and mortgages , but the partner is the same person , just a little older and a bit more careworn . So when things get hairy-the kids are at you , you 're at each other , the water heater is on the fritz-sit down and remember some early times together ... maybe literally a day at the beach . This kind of visualization lets you transcend the clutter of the moment and dean the emotional slate so you can come at things with a more generous outlook . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoes as getting back into your own . ( A size smaller , to be sure , but yours nonetheless . ) It 's OK to be a little manipulative Without getting into " The Total Woman " territory , when it 's appropriate , by all means encourage , appreciate , compliment , and applaud . Since it 's just us girls here , I will go on record as saying that men are really duck soup for this sort of thing . I do n't know why they respond so well to stroking , but they do . Look at it as behavior modification . Reinforce the things you like ( and want to see more of ) with praise . And put it out ofyour mind that this is how you train a dog . Last word If you want a friendly and solid marriage , approach itand him-with positive feelings . And generosity . And hope . As my grandfather used to say , " Cast your bread upon the waters and you will get back ... sandwiches . " <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
