<p> One holiday rolls right into the next , does n't it ? We kick it all off with a New Year 's bash and follow up with a host of special days that keeps the greeting card companies in business and the rest of us marveling at the fiscal absurdity of shelling out ooh-gobs of money for a folded piece of card stock . <p> Sure , it has colorful imprints of flowers and contains a cheesy sentiment on the inside flap , but is that really worth $3.50 or more , plus postage ? And how many people actually save these things ? <p> I decided to take a poll and discovered that one out of six people do save holiday and special occasion cards . <p> OK , so I only polled my immediate family , and as it turns out , I 'm the only Claro who keeps tons of old shoe boxes full of greeting cards and other memorabilia . I have a good reason for it though ; really , I do . Several , in fact . <p> The first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right , good old-fashioned guilt . If someone gives me something , I feel guilty disposing of it . I still have things that were given to me when I was a child , by people whose faces are long forgotten and whose names I can not recall . But , hey , whoever-they-are cared enough to send the very best ; the least I can do is hold on to it for a while . <p> One of my daughters was going through a box of stuffed animals in the attic and came across a red and white crocheted Santa with big , round , staring black eyes . He 's kind of cute in a creepy sort of way . <p> " Uh , Mama , " she said . " What is this thing ? " <p> " Duh , " I said . " Santa . " <p> " Well , yeah , but what kind of Santa ? Was it a give-away item at some horror movie when you were a kid ? You know , ' Ho-Ho-Horror at the North Pole ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a gift from "  --  I blinked  --  " well , from somebody . And they gave it to me for Christmas . " <p> " OK . And you keep it because ? " <p> " The girl was my friend a long time ago . I was 11 . " <p> " OK . " She nodded . " I get it . It reminds you that you were n't always old . " <p> Ah , children are such a joy and a blessing , are n't they ? <p> Then there is the pack-rattiness that demands I save a thing , however bizarre , because the importance of an event deems that I must . This habit will result in confusion for my three beloved children one day . At some point after the good Lord calls me home , my offspring will face the task of examining my vast store of shoe box treasures , and this is the conversation as I imagine it : <p> " Gosh , I miss her . She was the best , the coolest , the hippest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . She was the nicest , sweetest mom ever to walk the planet . Even when she would ground me and make her scary mom face , I still thought she was awesome . In her honor , I 've decided to keep my room clean forever . " <p> " All those lectures she used to give us , and the nagging ? Man , no one could nag and harp a subject to death like Mama . " Wipes away a tear . " I 'm really going to miss that . " <p> In unison : " She was one great mom . " <p> " Hey , " one of them will say as they rummage through one of my many paraphernalia-laden shoe boxes . " Here 's a red rock . What do you suppose this is from ? " <p> " More to the point , why would she save a rock ? " <p> " How about this ? " One will say . " A chunk of asphalt . " <p> " Here 's a little bitty box with something in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " <p> " There 's a molar . Ugh ! It has dried ookey stuff stuck to it ! " <p> " Why would she save a box of baby teeth ? " <p> They will each cover their mouth with their hands and consider the obvious . <p> In unison : " Ooooh , gross ! " <p> Nobody , no way , no how is going to understand why I save the odd things that I do . In the case of some items , even I ca n't recall why I opted to keep them , but if I 've had them this long , well , by golly , they may as well stay in that shoe box up in the attic . It is n't hurting anything , and maybe someday I 'll need it . Everyone knows that if you throw something away you need it the next day . This is a law of the cosmos . <p> The final reason why I am a pack rat is because some things are just too dear to be parted with , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I go through my stuff and come across a long forgotten cheer-up card from an old friend , or a letter from my parents , or a cocktail napkin from a special dinner , or yes , a big red rock ( do n't ask ; I promised my husband I would n't tell a soul ) , I am reminded of those people and those times , and it is like Christmas come early . The memories flow for just a moment before the precious pieces of my life are put back into the shoe box for safe keeping . <p> Although most people may not save mementos with the same disregard for attic space as I , still it should be noted that most do save something . Somewhere in everyone 's home is the requisite " junk drawer " or scrapbook or old trunk ; and I would wager that in each of these at least one overpriced greeting card lurks , hiding beneath take-out menus and dried up erasers , trash bag twist ties and fading photos , just waiting to be found and read again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental , or funny and cheesy the printed message is , because the real message , the one that counts , is n't in the card . <p> Yep . The card companies have it all figured out . Big holidays , obscure holidays  --  people buy and send greeting cards for just about every occasion . Here are just a few holidays that do n't swell up from media saturation , but you can still find a greeting card to cover it : Arbor Day , Administrative Professionals Day , Friendship Day . There is even a Hug an Australian Day . I do n't know if you can actually find a card for that one , but I 'll remember it if I ever meet Russell Crowe . <p> I 'm not complaining about any of this , because greeting cards make life easy for us pack rats . I can stuff a whole lot of cards into one shoe box . If among them is found the occasional chunk of asphalt , well , what of it ? At least my children will spend plenty of time thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just my odd belongings that spur them along . <p> " She sure saved some weird stuff . " <p> " She sure did . I 'm still going to miss her , though . " <p> " Me too . There 's one thing we can say about our beloved Mama that not too many kids can say . " <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " She saved the world  --  one shoe box at a time . " <p> * Lisa Ricard Claro is a freelance writer who lives with her family in Lawrenceville .
