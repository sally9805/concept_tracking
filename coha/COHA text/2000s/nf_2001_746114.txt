Regardless of their position on the political spectrum , knowledgeable observers seem to concur that too many new teachers entering the classroom in recent decades have neither an adequate understanding of the subject matter they are supposed to teach nor an adequate understanding of how to teach it . One of the most recent acknowledgments of this dual problem appears in a November 2000 report issued by the U.S. Department of Education titled " Eliminating Barriers to Improving Teaching . " Barrier 1 under " Preparation of Quality Teachers " is candidly described as " minimal or nonexistent requirements for entry into teacher education programs " and " less academic rigor than required for other college programs . " Barrier 5 , echoing part of Barrier 1 , is titled " Inadequate and poorly structured curriculum . " What is odd , however , is the example offered of a " Promising Alternative " to address Barrier 1 . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> A 3.0 GPA may sound good , but given grade inflation , we have no idea what it means today . More problematic is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in candidates who have demonstrated a reasonable understanding of the academic knowledge needed for teaching any of the subjects they would be expected to teach at the grade level they wish to teach , or have demonstrated that they have at least taken academic courses in these subjects , even if it is not clear what they have learned in them . <p> Chester Finn , president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation , and others make the case that education schools themselves are the major barrier to improving the quality of our teaching force . However , the thrust of my essay is not that we should eliminate education schools . An understanding of pedagogy as well as of subject matter is essential at all levels of education . Although secondary teachers of academic disciplines could be prepared pedagogically under the auspices of relevant arts and sciences departments , schools of education are still necessary for those who seek to teach children from pre-school through the elementary grades . We badly need a twenty-first-century Abraham Flexner to provide a reconceptualization of the institutional framework for training prospective teachers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods courses in the subjects taught in K-12 best located ? Who should design their content ? What should the qualifications of those who teach them be ? What and how many courses in pedagogy are actually necessary for prospective teachers ? And how can those who train teachers become more accountable to the public and to the parents of the children in our public schools ? This brief essay can not provide that reconceptualization . Instead , I will describe four major barriers that need to be overcome if we are to strengthen the academic background of prospective teachers . I will also indicate how the new teacher licensing regulations prepared by the Massachusetts Department of Education under Commissioner of Education David Driscoll and approved in November 2000 by the Massachusetts Board of Education under Chairman James Peyser are leapfrogging over one of those barriers in order to strengthen the academic background prospective elementary and middle school teachers will bring to their classrooms in the future . Until I became buried deep in the revision of the existing regulations , I had no idea that such an unglamorous document could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing this goal . <p> Barrier One : No systematic information available on program content and faculty qualifications . Surprisingly , despite a great deal of quantitative information about our schools of education in various collections of statistics , we know little about the quality or content of the courses they offer . There are occasional articles describing the preservice or inservice course(s) the author or a colleague has designed and taught . But there is no systematic research on the quality and content of the courses taught in schools of education . The coauthors of a 1995 monograph surveying the methods of teaching used in methods classes in English education commented baldly on the fact that the field of education is " simply not taken seriously by many citizens . " 1 They go on to say " that the education profession itself has exacerbated the problem by treating the methods course so lightly that we have little formal knowledge about the ways in which it is taught . " Indeed , the few ( highly critical ) examinations of the quality of courses taught in education schools that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ed School Follies , published in 1991 , and Heather Mac Donald 's article in the Spring , 1998 , issue of City Journal ) . 2 <p> Nor is there a body of information easily available on the qualifications of those who teach undergraduate or graduate education courses or of those who supervise student teachers in the schools . This information is collected and examined as part of the reaccreditation process for a teacher training program , either by a state agency or by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education . However , it is not compiled and made available as a body of public information . As noted by the authors of a 1998 article in the Review of Educational Research , data on teacher educators seems to be missing from the analytical literature. 3 It is quite difficult to reform a major public educational institution when there is virtually no systematic information available on the quality of the content of its courses or its faculty . <p> Control over the quality of the faculty and the content of education courses is generally maintained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feedback from the K-12 schools who hire their graduates would be a potent source of information . But , as we discovered in Massachusetts , most teacher training programs have no systematic information on what happens to their graduates even during their first year of teaching , never mind over several years . We do not know how long they stay in teaching , or what they or their principals think about the quality of their preparation for teaching . The only systematic information we are obtaining in Massachusetts today is from prospective teachers ' scores on statewide subject matter tests now required for their initial license ( and from a small but growing program for recipients of state bonuses and others new to teaching who are on a fast-track outside of education school training ) . 4 Regrettably , these test scores do not tell us much about the content of the training programs themselves , only the academic knowledge base of those allowed to graduate from the training program and recommended for licensure . <p> Barrier Two : A culture of flow academic expectations for K-12 students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low academic expectations for K-12 students . One way in which these expectations are reflected is in the claim that students today do as well if not better than students yesterday and that their performance today is reasonably good . This claim , embedded in the phrase , a " manufactured crisis , " is the thesis of a recent book by two educational researchers and teacher educators , David Berliner and Bruce Biddle . Even the National Council of Teachers of English proclaims in its Standards for the English Language Arts that " students today read better and write better than at any other time in the history of the country . " <p> These self-serving judgments can easily be unmasked for what they are by a glance at the small percentage of students on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests of reading and other subjects who score at or above the proficient level and by the results of recent international tests comparing our high school students ' performance in mathematics and science with the performance of students in other countries . It is not just our average students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . These judgments are also contradicted by the many studies that show the decreasing levels of reading difficulty in school textbooks in almost all subjects in K-12 over the course of this century . <p> A culture of low expectations is reflected in another , far more insidious way today . It is disguised behind the faade of " systemic education reform " and it advances under the banner of such appealing code words as " standards-based reform " and " deep conceptual understanding . " Who , after all , could be against standards or the effort to promote deep conceptual understanding of any academic discipline ? What these code words tend to mask , however , is a process I will describe as " dumbing up . " It is the reverse of " dumbing down , " which usually refers to the process by which the reading level and conceptual load of textbooks were regularly lowered beginning at the high school level and moving down to the elementary grades as more and more teachers found older students struggling with the vocabulary and ideational density of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reconstruction of the structure and content of the academic disciplines in the curriculum , particularly mathematics and science . Starting in the primary grades , it means putting less material to learn into the curriculum and having students spend more time learning whatever is there . As students move up the grades , they learn less than they previously would have learned in that subject because they have n't been exposed to the concepts or skills that would have enabled them to learn more . They may not in fact be ready for the formal study of algebra 1 until the later years of high school . Dumbing up in mathematics is also driven by an egalitarian premise ; if all students ca n't learn algebra 1 in grade 8 , then no one should . In science , dumbing up means introducing elementary students to fewer science concepts and having them spend more time engaging in " inquiry , " considered a motivational strategy . By the high school level , less can be learned in science , especially since the level of mathematics students have achieved has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of teaching : Given the lack of clear , credible , and substantial evidence to support the pedagogical/curricular recommendations proposed by education school faculty in recent decades , it is not at all clear what education professors could actually know , as opposed to what they believe , about how children learn. 5 Nevertheless , many education faculty proudly trumpet that they now know what " best practices " are . These are deemed to include , among other pedagogical procedures or techniques , the heavy use of calculators in mathematics classes , student-invented algorithms , " cooperative " learning groups in which more able students teach less able students , informal tests and portfolio collections , heterogeneous grouping , student choice of reading material or questions to pursue in science , and " real-world " applications of what students have learned . These so-called best practices , which emphasize the teacher as facilitator , coach , or " guide on the side , " clearly exclude such pedagogical procedures or techniques as whole class teaching , formal tests or quizzes , individual work , direct instruction , memorization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to foreground the teacher as a source of intellectual authority , as determiner of the classroom curriculum , and as judge of student learning . Interestingly enough , these are the very practices whose efficacy is actually supported by a great deal of credible and clear evidence , unlike the " best practices " promoted by education schools . What is even more interesting is that the practices associated with structured teaching and learning turn out to be those emphasized by teachers of low-income students in schools with relatively high achievement , 6 much to the chagrin of the education professors and writers who have long professed that these non-best practices are damaging to these children . <p> A recent case in point is a featured article in the January 2001 issue of Curriculum Administrator highlighting the extraordinary academic achievement of the low-income Hispanic and African American students in the KIPP Academies , charter-like schools for grades 5 to 8 students in the Bronx and Houston , Texas. 7 The reporter quotes two educators attempting to discredit the academies despite their stunning academic results and the support they receive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-known and well-paid speaker and writer on " best practices , " is quoted as saying that " such a program turns children into trained seals ' that merely follow instructions " and that it is " disheartening " to find programs " so out of step with what the best practice of research says about learning . " Kohn 's views are seconded by a cofounder of Best Practice High School in Chicago and professor at National Louis University in Chicago , who is quoted as saying that what worries him is the " widespread belief that the most effective school for city kids is a kind of authoritarian , knuckle-knocking , skill-and-drill , back-to-the-basics approach and a focus on tight discipline and rigid behavior patterns . " Caricaturing or stigmatizing structured teaching and self-disciplined learning is the preferred rhetorical tactic of educators who have no body of credible evidence to support their beliefs and are unable to criticize these highly effective non-best practices in rational argument . There is no reason why a complete range of strategies and procedures should not be available to all teachers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple points of view on any topic for which they have a point of view . <p> Barrier Four : A culture of low expectations for K-12 teachers ' knowledge of academic subject matter . Too many teacher educators seem to lack expectations that teachers should be knowledgeable about their own subjects . The indifference of these teacher educators to the crucial role of teacher knowledge of subject matter in improving student achievement is clearly suggested by the " Equity Policy " passed at the end of 1998 by Division K of the American Educational Research Association , the division concerned with Teaching and Teacher Education . The Equity Policy is a very lengthy resolution listing the many things that teacher education programs should advocate for or address that , in the eyes of its authors , would improve the education of all students . The only matter the resolution failed to include in its exceedingly long laundry list was the need for teachers to be competent in their subject matter. 8 This omission was remarkable because a body of research has regularly confirmed that the chief instructional variable correlated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal ability. 9 <p> In fact , this body of research served as the rationale for a major revision of Massachusetts ' teacher licensing regulations in 2000 . It was clear to those of us working on this revision ( at the direction of both the Commissioner of Education and the Board of Education ) that the academic background of prospective elementary and middle school teachers , in particular , needed drastic strengthening , whether or not these prospective K-8 teachers had a major in the arts or sciences . Let me explain briefly why this was the case . <p> Undergraduate teacher training programs , which tend to be the training grounds for most elementary and middle school teachers in this country , must do two different things to produce well-prepared teachers by the time they graduate , one of which is completely under their control , one of which is not . They must provide appropriate pedagogical coursework addressing the academic content acquired by the undergraduates who intend to become teachers of that content area , and they must ensure that those they admit into their teacher training programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arts and sciences . Their responsibilities are much easier to fulfill with respect to those who become teachers of secondary school subjects . One can normally rely on the requirements for a major in the arts and sciences to provide those who major in a particular subject with sufficient academic background to teach its content in the secondary school . And one can normally expect an undergraduate who wishes to teach , say , high school English or biology to choose to major in English or biology . However , the situation is quite different for the prospective elementary teacher . It may also be quite different for the undergraduate seeking to teach in the middle school . <p> In Massachusetts , as in many other states , all prospective teachers in undergraduate institutions by law must have an arts or sciences major . But , as we discovered through surveys , the majority of prospective elementary teachers does not choose to major in one of the subjects they will teach in grades 1 to 6 ( English , history , geography , government/civics , mathematics , and science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad general education or core distribution requirements across colleges , it is quite possible that few prospective elementary teachers actually take any courses in U.S. history , European history , other world history , American literature , British literature , other world literature , composition , economics , geography , and U.S. government , one or more science laboratory courses , and mathematics and non-laboratory science courses in the arts and sciences appropriate for the elementary teacher . Moreover , because many colleges also require an education major , the number of courses undergraduates take in their junior and senior years outside their arts or sciences major is probably even more limited . <p> Prospective middle school teachers in undergraduate institutions in Massachusetts by law must also have an arts or sciences major . Those who have chosen to major in one of the major subjects taught in grades 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ( English , history , geography , government/civics , mathematics , and science ) and who then obtain a license to teach that subject in the middle school clearly have had sufficient academic coursework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who have chosen to obtain a middle school generalist license , as it is called in Massachusetts . Under the regulations in effect until 2001 ( the situation is similar in many other states ) , they have been required to complete only a minimum of 24 semester hours across a range of academic disciplines ( including more than those subjects listed above ) , which may or may not overlap with the requirements they must fulfill for a major in the arts or sciences . Worse yet , with a generalist license , they have been deemed prepared to teach all subjects in self-contained classrooms in grades 5-8 . <p> Again , with broadly varying curricular requirements across colleges , few prospective middle school generalist teachers may have studied fundamental and necessary upper-level subjects in the arts and sciences . The additional requirement of a major or minor in education may also severely limit aspiring undergraduate generalists in the subjects with which they are acquainted outside of their arts and sciences majors . <p> In addition , many middle school teachers hold elementary licenses because grades 5 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in Massachusetts ( and in many other states ) they are allowed to teach outside their license for 20 percent of their time , some could be teaching in grades 7 and 8 . Further , large numbers of middle school teachers were elementary school teachers who added the middle school level to their license by taking a few courses , usually in an education school . <p> To remedy this Alice in Wonderland situation-granting teachers licenses to teach subjects in which they may have taken no academic coursework-the Massachusetts Department of Education proposed a path-breaking requirement ( that may sound like simple common sense to ordinary people ) as part of its new Regulations for Educator Licensure and Preparation Program Approval , approved unanimously by the Board of Education at its November 2000 meeting . Undergraduates seeking an elementary license ( grades 1-6 ) must henceforth have : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Undergraduates seeking a middle school license ( grades 5-8 ) must now have : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Needless to say , there was a great deal of opposition to these regulations by many education school faculty before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college went so far as to accuse the Department of Education of violating her students ' " academic freedom " by its insistence that those who wanted to become elementary teachers should take academic coursework in the subjects they would actually teach in the elementary school . Nevertheless , with these newly approved requirements in place , we hope to see future elementary and middle school teachers with strong content knowledge in the subjects they teach-teachers who can challenge the most able students in grades 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 rather than feel intimidated by them . We want to deter the flight from public schools of parents with high achieving children at the same time we provide all children , including those in our inner cities , with academically qualified teachers . <p>
