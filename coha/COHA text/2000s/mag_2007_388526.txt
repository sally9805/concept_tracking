Headnote Beyond the free market // WE CAN NOT ASSUME that the free market will provide basic sustenance for all . The problem with the free market is that it distributes goods on only one basis-desert . You get what you earn , or you get what you can pay for . The free market does not address claims based on need . In the market , a persons marginal contribution to market productivity is the sole reason she or he has an effective claim to goods and services . A hungry child , however , can claim nothing from the market . She must come up with the effective demandmoney-to pay for any item of food . Given this critique , one might assume that I oppose distribution of goods via freemarket exchange . I do not . In fact , I believe that most goods should be exchanged via the free market , because it is an extraordinarily effective means of distribution , and it promotes commutative justice within the economic sphere . It rewards those who contribute economically , and sometimes it punishes those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals can choose how they use their resources . It does not compel anyone to make evil purchases ; it permits everyone to make good purchases . What 's more , there is simply no better system available for distributing goods . Peoples and societies have tried various forms of socialism , communism and egalitarianism , and they have failed . Replacing an effective market with an ineffective command system has been historically shown to cause greater harm than good . Therefore , I acknowledge-and even celebrate-the good and the justice that the market provides at this point . While I agree that the market standard of desert based on economic contribution is appropriate in instrumental spheres such as business , that is not to say that the justice of the marketplace is sufficient . It does not provide basic sustenance for all God s children . As a result , a system of distributive justice that uses only the free market is necessarily less comprehensive and less just than one that also recognizes the validity of claims based on need . At least three schools of economics explicitly endorse claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the school that follows Amartya Sen , a Nobel laureate in economics who has developed the concept of " basic capabilities " ; the tradition of Dutch theologian and politician Abraham Kuyper ; and the school of social economics associated with the International Journal of Social Economics . Although the formulations and underlying philosophical assumptions of these schools may differ , all three recognize that 1 ) the " rational choice " theory of mainstream economics is not sufficient to explain all of human behavior ; 2 ) there is an important and legitimate role for free exchange and entrepreneurial development ; 3 ) a just distribution of material goods will require that we prioritize the basic human need for sustenance ; 4 ) society and society 's wellbeing is not merely an aggregate of each individual s satisfactions-rather , individuals are part of an organic whole ; and ( 5 ) the optimal allocation of resources as defined by economic efficiency ( Tareto optimality , " following the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto ) is inadequate to describe true human well-being . Some may object that redistribution is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , argues that any system of justice that shows partiality to some individuals , even the poor , is incompatible with the true standard of justice , which of necessity is impartial . For Beisner , " all other regulations of economic activity other than those necessary to prohibit , prevent , and punish fraud , theft and violence are therefore unjust " ( Prosperity and Poverty ) . Beisner and other libertarians have a very firm notion of the inherent justice of the status quo : initial endowments are sacred , as are the property rights that protect them . In fact , these rights take priority over human claims based on need . I see at least three flaws here . First , from a Christian viewpoint , the Bible does in fact show partiality for the widow , the orphan and the alien , and the grounds for this " preferential option " is , very simply , their neediness . The Bible also clearly shows that property is held in trust . In Leviticus 25:23 , God says , " The land is mine and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage on all our property and requires that it be used in service of the community-especially the needy within the community . In Deuteronomy 10:17 , God declares himself to be impartial in judgment and the defender of the widow and the orphan : " For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords , the great , mighty and terrible God . He is no respecter of persons ; he is not to be bribed ; he secures justice for the fatherless and the widow , and he shows love towards the alien who lives among you , giving him food and clothing . " Second , the notion of distribution versus redistribution is a fiction . There is no pristine state of distribution from which all other arrangements are unjust redistributions . Goods are always flowing . Where would our original state of distribution begin ? Would it begin before our European ancestors took the land from the North American Indians ? Would it begin before the egregious accounting scandals at Enron that left thousands without pensions ? Would it begin before or after various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin before we were born in the United States and before others were born in Central America ? Clearly , there is no such thing as an initial distribution point from which changes are to be regarded as unjust inasmuch as they are a form of redistribution . This is an ahistorical position that serves as a justification of a status quo that leaves millions without basic necessities . In addition to ignoring history , the argument against redistribution in every form ignores the reality of power . The libertarian position advocates that we simply follow the rules of the game , assuming that the rules are agreed upon . Consider the following as an example of the kind of game that might result . The rules of baseball are well established : each team gets three outs , there are three strikes and four balls possible in each at-bat , you must tag up on fly balls , and so forth . All baseball teams throughout the world agree on these rules . Let 's say that the New York Yankees agree to play my church 's team , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the game is played . Is that a fair ballgame ? The libertarian may have to answer yes ; that is , if the rules are agreed upon and followed , the results-inevitable though they may be-are fair . Most people-and I include myself among them-would question not only whether this was a fair ballgame but whether it was a baseball game at all . The discrepancies in power and skill are so great that what happens on the field might be considered a kind of circus-or a form of humiliation . We could go even further . Let 's say that the Yankees agree that they will be permitted only two strikes per atbat and two outs per inning . In other words , the rules are now unfairly biased against them . Even though my friend Rob Buikema , a 49-year-old labor attorney , is a good shortstop , would anyone bet on him batting or fielding better than Derek Jeter ? Would anyone care to bet on the Brookfield Reformers winning this game that is now grossly unfair in their favor ? Following the rules will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping the needy is certainly a laudable thing , doing so is an act of mercy or love , not justice . But the Bible speaks against that notion . The Bible makes commands : leave the gleanings in the field , declare a Year of Jubilee , redeem the property of your brother , do not hold back the wages of a hired hand , be open-handed toward any of your compatriots who are in poverty and need . Not one of these commands is found in a biblical appendix labeled " For the Especially Merciful . " Furthermore , this objection is based on a false distinction between love and law . Jesus says , " If you love me you will keep my commandments , " and " if you obey my commands you will remain in my love " ( John 14:15 ; 15:10 ) . Law and love are not at opposite poles in scripture ; they support each other . Nowhere does scripture support an opposition between love and justice that leaves the provision of basic sustenance as an optional claim . This false idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scripture also leads to a false distinction between civil and religious law : that is , civil laws are enforceable , and religious laws are unenforceable and optional . Related to this is the objection that providing basic sustenance for all is not a task that the government should coerce but one that people of good will should freely take up . While I agree that it is a task that people of good will should certainly take up , it is also a matter of justice , and government can rightfully coerce it . First of all , it is clear that the government does have the authority to coerce . It coerces me to pay taxes , to drive responsibly , to support public education . It even coerces me to help finance tilings that many believe are evil-such as fighting unprovoked wars , aborting unborn children , and building antiballistic missile systems that do n't work . So how can the government not coerce a good , such as the provision of basic needs for all ? Second , the government can rightfully coerce us to provide basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolterstorff argues this point well : " Our concern with poverty is not an issue of generosity but of rights . If a rich man knows of someone who is starving and has the power to help that person but chooses not to do so , then he violates the starving person s rights as surely and reprehensibly as if he had physically assaulted the sufferer " ( Until Justice and Peace Embrace ) . While I am not certain that in such a case the rights are violated as reprehensibly as in a physical assault , the point is taken . Harm is done to the weak , be it by omission or commission . Rights are indeed violated , and rights and justice are matters of state . Yes , the government is capable of acting and justified in acting , and it should act . While a theory of distributive justice may well offer a way forward in addressing the problem of basic human needs , the outstanding problem for activating such a proposal is clearly moral and political . In most contemporary societies , the claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all or is seen only as a moral option . While many programs throughout the world do relieve deprivation , the claim to basic sustenance has not been validated by a political body capable of enforcing it . The moral right to basic sustenance is thus a political orphan . Pressing the claim for public validation of the right to sustenance is an outstanding challenge of our time . Thus far , the many noble statements that address this issue are not enforceable , and therefore they leave basic needs unmet . Which governmental policies shall be pursued to provide to those lacking basic sustenance ? Exactly how shall goods be distributed , and who shall distribute them ? I can not pretend to answer a host of such policy questions . Strategies for the provision of basic sustenance could include a range of policies designed to " avoid deprivation , protect persons from deprivation , and aid the deprived " ( Henry Shue in Basic Rights : Subsistence , Affluence and U.S. Foreign Policy ) . Since the answer to such policy questions changes from place to place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norms of justice will also change over time and place . Wise economists , politicians , businesspeople , citizens and believers together , in their particular contexts , must answer these policy questions in the push and pull of local , national and international governance . The right to basic sustenance can be met . The world economy has more than enough resources to provide sustenance for all . In a study of this issue , the Brandt Report says : The actual cost for eliminating world poverty is far lower than most people realize . In the late 1990s , the UNDP ( United Nations Development Program ) projected some of the annual expenses of a global antipoverty program , including $9 billion for water and sanitation , $6 billion for education , and $13 billion for health and nutrition . According to other estimates from the World Bank , the price tag on a comprehensive international relief package would be about $80 billion a year-about 10% of the worlds annual military budget . In more individualized terms , UNICEF says that a donation of $17 will provide immunization " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child-killing and maiming diseases : measles , polio , diphtheria , whooping cough , tetanus , and tuberculosis . " An executive at a Christian development agency told me that for approximately $200 per year that agency could free a family from destitution and provide it with basic sustenance . The disturbing question is this : Why have n't we each paid the $200 ? Or , if we have been privileged with opportunity and wealth , why have n't we paid a multiple of the $200 ? One reason may be that we have thought foreign aid and charity were doing the job . They are not . Another reason may be that we do n't believe that redistributing money is an effective approach to solving the problem . In particular , there may be some countries in which the infrastructure is such that more money may only exacerbate the problems . But Joseph Stiglitz , winner of the Nobel Prize and the chief economist of the World Bank , notes that " just as aid is poised to be at its most effective , the volume of aid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In point of fact , a large number of extraordinary people do relief and development work . Among my acquaintances are entrepreneurs who scour Haiti looking for ways to start businesses , agriculturalists who travel the world looking for ways to improve farms , and community developers from " two-thirds world " nations who build up the social base of some of the poorest communities on earth . These farmers , businesspeople and community development workers can and do get the job done . And more of them , with more resources , could do a great deal more . ANOTHER REASON we may not yet have committed our support is that we do n't see the reality of starvation and disease close at hand . Few people I know would send a starving child away if he or she showed up on their front doorstep . But the child in Africa , Asia or Latin America does not receive such generosity from our hands . Does distance really remove responsibility ? In Living High and Letting Die : Our Illusion of Innocence , philosopher Peter Unger tells a story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had purchased a vintage sports car but not yet insured it . When he was driving it home , the car stalled on a railroad track . Leaving his car to get help , he noticed a child stuck on another railroad track that formed a Y with the track his car was on . He walked up the track well past the Y. Meanwhile a runaway train came down the track . There was a switch near him that could send the train either toward his car or toward the child . One or the other would be destroyed . Bob threw the switch and saved his car . Most people would find Bob 's action morally reprehensible : he chose to save a piece of tin rather than a human life . But in what significant way is Bob 's choice different from our own ? We know that many are dying , we have the means to save them , yet we choose to spend our resources on luxuries . One rationalization may be that we assume that there were actually a dozen Ys in the track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrecked their car and saved the child before we did . In a sense , this maybe the case . There are others who may be closer , or have more direct knowledge of the child . But if all 12 ahead of us have failed to pull the switch , does the 13th not have any responsibility ? Or we may be looking at each other and saying , " You can afford to contribute far better than I can . " These kinds of rationalizations may well be what lie behind our inaction . In fact , few of us would be asked to sacrifice something that is as valuable as a vintage sports car . At the Millennium Summit in 2000 , the World Bank estimated that it would cost between $40 and $60 billion per year in additional aid to cut poverty in half by 2015 . There are approximately 600 million adults in the developed nations of the world . Thus a donation or tax of $100 per year per adult would be on the high side of the estimate of funds needed to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable , but half would be an enormous blessing . As the ancient Jewish rabbis said , " Whoever destroys a single soul should be considered the same as one who has destroyed a whole world . And whoever saves one single soul is to be considered the same as one who has saved a whole world . " The problem , I repeat , is not a technical one . We have gifted farmers , development workers , teachers , businesspeople and engineers who already know how to effectively improve human welfare . Nor would a gift or tax of $100-200 per year per person require an overthrow of free-market exchange . Political theorist Charles Lindblom says : " Neither logic nor empirical evidence shows the impossibility-even the improbability-of reconciling a real-world market system with a greatly more egalitarian distribution of wealth and income " ( Politics and Markets ) . The problem is , in fact , a moral one : we have simply not chosen to distribute goods in such a way that the basic needs of all human beings are met .
