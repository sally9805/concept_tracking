Danielle Patrice was born to the Florida couple on January 28 , shortly after their 26th wedding anniversary . " It was just a miracle . It was just so much joy . I had to ask myself , " Was this really real ? " Patricia , 45 , tells JET , explaining that she had five previous miscarriages . Danielle was her sixth pregnancy . " She was just so tiny and I was like , " God I thank you . " " " I call her my little joy , " says the proud father , Daniel , 46 . " Every day , I call her my little joy . " Patricia Williams is among the many women who have successfully conceived later in life . She joins the ranks of stars such as Halle Berry , 41 , who recently announced that she is expecting , and Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon who , at 40 , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fall . Whether a woman decides to conceive at mid-life because of financial , professional or social reasons , having a baby later in life is common these days . The March of Dimes reports that one in five women has her first child after age 35 . The National Center For Health Statistics reports that the birth rates for women ages 35-39 and 40-44 has continued to rise in recent years , increasing 2 percent for both age groups . Though middle-aged women are able to conceive , and advances in medicine aide in safer pregnancies , doctors say that women who get pregnant after age 35 should understand the risks in order to minimize complications and improve their chances of having a healthy pregnancy and child . Some risks include decreased fertility , premature birth , having a child with birth defects or developing health problems , such as diabetes . Dr. Laura Riley , medical director of labor and delivery at Boston-based Massachusetts General Hospital and former chairwoman of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology , says proper preparation is key . " The first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the problem with half of America right now-half of all pregnancies are unplanned .

Riley also urges women who have medical conditions to discuss their illnesses with physicians before conception , and she recommends talking to doctors about taking medications that are safe during pregnancy . Patricia Williams , who suffered from high blood pressure before she became pregnant , said she made sure she followed her doctor 's orders by regularly taking prescribed hypertension medication , prenatal vitamins and getting ample rest to ensure a safer pregnancy . She also changed her diet by eating more fruit and reducing her salt intake . " That was the first thing they told me . I was like , " Realty . I ca n't eat without salt , ' ' " she laughed .

" Dr. Estelle Whitney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out that women may have conditions that they 're not aware of and should consider a full physical before conception . " We 've got a lot of high blood pressure and diabetes in our community , as well as lupus and other autoimmune diseases that need to be taken care of . Of course a healthy mom is what 's important in order to have a healthy pregnancy . " Dr. Diane Ashton , deputy medical director of the national office of the March of Dimes , which is sponsoring the Every Baby Has A Story campaign until Nov. 13 in order to raise awareness of healthy births , says women also need to get their weight in check . " We know that obesity and being underweight increases the risk of complications with pregnancy , " Ashton says . Doctors say that women should add healthy habits , such as taking vitamin supplements with folic acid , before conception , and stop any addictions , including smoking and drinking alcohol . Early prenatal care is also vital . Women need to be aware of complications that can occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Women should pay attention to any abnormal vaginal spotting , leaking of fluid or unusual pain-all of those are symptoms that something might be going on with the pregnancy and they need to contact their physician , " Ashton says . " During their third trimester , they need to be aware of how active the baby is . As pregnancy progresses-because the baby is growing and the space in the uterus is decreasing-there tends to be less movement by the third trimester , but still there should be movement that the mother is able to detect on a regular basis . " Because Patricia Williams was 44 and battling hypertension , along with having a history of miscarriages , doctors kept a close eye on her during her pregnancy . " They really wanted to monitor me closely because I was a high-risk patient , so sometimes I would go weekly . One week I would go to the regular obstetrician , one week to a specialist , so I had a lot of doctor visits , " she says . Though her original due date was April 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 30 weeks pregnant . Her blood pressure was really high and she was retaining fluids .

She loves to watch cartoons and enjoys rolling across the floor .
