Slick and Laura went over the plan one more time . Laura was tired and apprehensive , and she fumbled her part . <p> " Damn it , " she said . " Just call me butterfingers . " <p> Laura did n't curse often , but when she did , Slick knew she had reached her limit . <p> Laura was still skeptical about this new assignment . She stood up and walked around the room , deep in thought . She stopped at the window and looked out . <p> Garbo , who was practicing with them , grabbed hold of Laura 's pant leg and would n't let go . Laura laughed in spite of herself . She stroked the dog 's head . Garbo immediately let go of her pant leg , wiggled her hind quarters , and rolled over on her back to get more . <p> Laura shook her head in exasperation <p> " What 's wrong ? " Slick asked . <p> " Garbo is better at this than I am . I 'm not sure I 'm ready . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you see me drop the package ? " <p> " So you made a mistake . " <p> " I dropped it before , too , " Laura reminded her . <p> " That 's why we practice , " Slick said encouragingly . <p> Laura looked doubtful . " I ca n't afford to make a mistake . You 're depending on me . " <p> " We 'll do it again . You 'll get it right next time . " <p> Laura , irritated with herself , kicked the package she had been practicing with . " Damn it ! I have n't gotten it right yet ! Why do you keep saying I can do this ? " <p> Slick came up behind her and encircled Laura in her arms . Laura 's head was a nice fit beneath her chin . <p> " Because you can , that 's why . You know the drill . " <p> Laura relaxed and pulled Slick 's arms tighter around her . <p> " I know it , but I 'm worried I 'll screw it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with big consequences . " <p> " You 're just a little nervous . " <p> " Nervous ! I 'm scared stiff . I 've got goose bumps the size of tomatoes . " <p> " You can do this , Laura . " <p> Laura sighed and tilted her head to look at Slick . " Why ca n't you have a regular nine-to-five job ? " <p> Slick laughed and pulled her closer . " Why did you leave your regular nine-to-five job to join me in this ? " she asked . <p> Slick nuzzled and kissed her head , savoring the smell of the shampoo on Laura 's long blond hair , which tickled Slick 's nose . <p> Laura smiled . She sure had n't started out doing this line of work . <p> She looked out the window of the home her father had built . A sixty-two-room mansion on 30,000 acres in the sprawling Ramapo Mountains in New Jersey . <p> Laura 's father , Owen Charles , had left her independently wealthy . He had made a fortune in the 1950s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only child , and even though Owen could be a ruthless businessman and a philandering husband , he had worshipped Laura . <p> She grew up in this house , surrounded by all the things money could buy , and she inherited everything . She knew at an early age that she was gay , so she never married , never had children . She ran the business well and made some significant improvements . No one could accuse her of simply living on her father 's famous name . <p> She had been comfortable running the business she inherited and living the life of a wealthy socialite when she met and fell in love with Slick , a black female cop from Newark . The fact that they met , fell in love , and stayed there was a miracle . <p> Slick moved in , and after years of spirited and often loud debate , Laura finally convinced her to quit the police force and work at the clam company . This happened when a fellow officer took a bullet in the shoulder from a crack-crazed kid . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she never lost her desire for police work . <p> A few years earlier , when Laura 's longtime butler , Judson , asked her for help in a murder case that involved his niece , Slick jumped at the chance to get back into detective work , and Laura joined her . They solved the case , and Laura never went back to work at the clam company . <p> " Okay , " Laura admitted , " I like working cases . I 've enjoyed every minute of it until now . This one is different . This guy is dangerous . Very dangerous . " <p> " Dangerous , yes , but not unpredictable . He 's developed a pattern . He 's acted in a very specific and methodical way . And that is how we 're going to catch him . " <p> " What if he suspects something ? He wo n't show if he thinks it 's a trap . " <p> " Then we can always catch him another time . He 's good at what he does , Laura . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end for him if we do n't stop him now . " <p> Laura was thoughtful . " Is it wrong of me to wish he does n't show up ? " <p> Slick laughed . " No , but I 'd like to help get him . Would n't you ? " <p> " I suppose , but ... " <p> " Look , there 'll be protection everywhere on the street , and we 'll be in constant communication with them . " <p> " Accidents still happen . If anything happened to you ... " <p> " I 'll be fine , " Slick assured her . <p> " You better . We 're going on vacation when this thing is over . We 've earned it . " <p> " You know , I 'm not the only one taking a risk here , Laura . What you 're doing in this operation is not without some danger . " <p> " Not like you . " <p> " We 've run through every security threat possible . You know how people always say , ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? Well , this really is going to be okay . " <p> Slick wondered if her words sounded as hollow to Laura as they did to her . She believed what she was saying , but it did sound lame . <p> Laura looked at her and nodded . Without conviction , Slick thought . <p> " For you it 's just another day on the job . I 'm a babe in the woods on this , " Laura said . <p> " You are a babe for sure , but you 're getting good at this detective stuff . Look at how far you 've come since our first case . You have great instincts , and I need you . " <p> Laura leaned back against her . " Say it again and make me believe it . " <p> Slick turned her around and looked deeply in her eyes . <p> " I do need you . I work better with a partner . I was a good cop , but having Sam with me made me a better one . We were a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Laura seemed to brighten a little . <p> " Besides , Laura , I know you . You started this , and I know you want to see how it ends . Am I right ? " <p> " Yeah , I guess so . " <p> " We 're going to laugh about this when it 's over . " <p> " What if it turns out to be a disaster ? " <p> Slick shrugged . " Then it was all your idea , " she said . " That 's the other good thing about having a partner-you can blame someone else . " <p> Laura punched her playfully . <p> " You know it 's a good plan . It will work . " <p> " Then we might as well see it through . " <p> " That 's my girl , " Slick said proudly . <p> They would n't have to talk about it again . <p> Laura clapped her hands . Garbo sat at attention . Slick resumed practice mode . <p> " Okay , suit up , you two , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " <p> Chapter Two Another Friday night was fast approaching on Halsey Street in Newark . The children of the night were busily preparing for the weekend sex trade . Strip club and XXX movie theater owners swept the floors and took cursory swipes at the mixture of dried bodily goop on the seats . <p> The massage parlors and the rent-by-the-hour motels doubled their staffs to cover the next forty-eight hours . The sex novelty store owners restocked their shelves with dildos , butt plugs , bondage supplies , edible undies , and the latest desensitizing lotions for the premature ejaculate/sore anus crowd . <p> As darkness fell , the prostitutes began to walk " the stroll " in timed strides . The air was filled with the rising sounds of whistles , catcalls , car horns , and giggles . <p> Variety is the spice of life , and the great variety of ages , races , body shapes , and specialty acts available on Halsey Street was more than enough to scratch any fantasy itch . Straight , gay , bi , or trans , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sex was for sale every day of the week on Halsey Street , but the weekends brought more hustle and bustle , emphasis on the hustle . <p> Businessmen on business trips wanting to fast-forward to the juicy bits cruised the streets looking for the no-strings-attached screw before returning home . Car doors would open and prices were negotiated . <p> Cut-to-the-quick suck or fuck . <p> College boys , classes done for the week , looking now to party , dared each other to do a prostitute at least once . It was so entertaining to the workers . Young men , especially the big jocks , nervously approached the whores ; then most walked away quickly . A few stayed . It all depended on the come-on . Some of the older , more experienced , pros had all the amorous charm of used-car salesmen . The younger ones had perfected an appealing come-hither look-lips pursed , eyelashes batting , topped off with a shy innocent blush , smile , and look-away act . <p> No matter what the approach , none of these sex providers felt exploited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of protection . They looked at prostitution as a short stop on their way to greater things . They felt that purchased whoopee was just another service for sale . Money paid for services provided . No more exploitive than any money paid to your mechanic or your dentist . <p> The police patrolling Halsey Street kept a low profile . They made some token arrests of the prostitutes from time to time but usually stepped in only when big-time drug dealers tried to come in and sell heavy drugs or when pimps tried to harass the streetwalkers . It worked that way for years . The area was n't residential , so very few locals complained about it . The shop owners who were n't involved in the sale of sex-related merchandise were closed and gone for the day before the action really got going . <p> The police often started here when looking for bigger busts , because this was a portal to whatever was happening on the streets . No matter what the criminal activity , someone on Halsey Street had information about it . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes and ears for the cops , because they knew the police let them sell their more fun parts . <p> So , it was the start of just another Friday night on Halsey Street , swelling up with a thousand different ways to separate sex from love . <p> Streetwalking regulars Lady Dijonnaise and Sheleeta Buffet ambled through the crowds , taking in the Friday night sights and sounds . The twin six-foot-seven , 350-pound black transvestites , who had begun life as Cletis and Cleotis Stubbs , respectively , were well known . According to urban legend , they once had been pro wrestlers turned celebrity bodyguards and now , cross-dressing hookers . <p> Lady and Sheleeta stopped and exchanged friendly banter with the sex workers as they made their way down the street . There was an easygoing feeling of camaraderie among the hookers . They understood one another , and they looked out for one another . Tonight , all the talk was about the bond issue that was soon to be voted on . If it passed , many of the workers were afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear them off the street to make way for the shiny new office towers , shopping malls , and residential communities . It had already happened in other sections of Newark . The city was trying to bounce back from years of depression . As the city rebuilt , the sex workers lost territory . Halsey Street was one of the few remaining areas where no one really bothered them . <p> Lady and Sheleeta tried to assure the hookers that the bond issue would never pass . <p> " This is going to be another good night on the stroll . " Lady Dijonnaise laughed excitedly as she looked at the waves of horny humanity flowing by . <p> " The sweet smell of cock is in the air ! " She threw her head back and inhaled deeply , savoring the smell . <p> " No , honey , I just burped , " Sheleeta replied , and fanned at the air in front of her face , trying to make the burp disappear . " You probably just smellin ' my last trick 's dick area . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely man region . Just lovely . Succulent ! Wonderfully maintained ! Fragrant like the first day of spring . His balls were elegantly trimmed and coiffed , cut to highlight a super-sized King Kong unit . But , sadly , his big monkey 's spunky was a little funky . " <p> Sheleeta reached into her purse and pulled out a tin of Altoids . She was about to pop one into her mouth when her attention was drawn to a beautiful Japanese woman approaching . Sheleeta became rigid with emotion . The woman who stopped Sheleeta in her tracks was the former Mr. Haiku Ono , a recently transgendered hooker known as Spicy Tuna . <p> Spicy saw Sheleeta and quickly crossed the street to get away . <p> " You better step off before I throw some wasabi whoopass on you ! " Sheleeta shouted as Spicy retreated . Seconds later , Sheleeta was trembling , almost in tears . <p> Lady went to Sheleeta and tried to give comfort . " Now , girl , do n't be reliving your personal tragedy out here on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell that to my heart ! My wounds have n't healed ! I 'm still in pain , " Sheleeta blurted out . " That bitch poisoned my cat ! Then she took the carcass and threw it on my porch . Oh , the ugliness ! The carnage ! I can still hear the screams . " <p> " You were the one screaming , Sheleeta , " Lady reminded her . " The cat had been dead for hours . " <p> " I 'm having a flashback . " <p> Now Sheleeta was brimming with tears . <p> " You 're right , honey . Sure you 're right . That girl served you up a big steaming bowl of WRONG . But Spicy was off her lithium at the time . You know she is crazy as hell when she is off that shit , " Lady tried to reason . <p> Sheleeta nodded in understanding and tried bravely to suck up her tears of grief . <p> " But Peesonthechaise was a wonderful cat , was n't he ? " Her words were choked and halting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheleeta lost the battle and collapsed into a sobbing , wailing wreck . Fortunately , there was enough Kleenex in her purse for crisis tear-dabbing and nose-blowing . <p> Lady Dijonnaise wrapped her massive arms around the massive Sheleeta Buffet in a big bear hug . They each felt the other 's beard stubble . <p> " I mourn that cat every day , too , Sheleeta . " <p> Lady hated herself for lying to her brother/sister . There had been times when Lady wanted to stuff Peesonthechaise down the garbage disposal , but she could n't figure out a way to make the gruesome death look accidental . She was glad the little bastard was dead , and she was secretly grateful to Spicy Tuna for taking him out . <p> Lady looked up and down the street for something to take Sheleeta 's mind off her dead cat . If Sheleeta did n't stop crying soon , she 'd start to hiccup uncontrollably . When that happened , she looked like a big-ass widemouthed frog on steroids . <p> Lady had to stop the crying now . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw what she was looking for and smiled broadly . <p> " Who wants to split a bucket of Original Recipe ? " she cooed . <p> " Oh , the Colonel ! I 'd love some . I 'm already having a delish-o-gasm ! " <p> Sheleeta broke free of Lady 's arms and bounded across the street toward the KFC , her Manolo Blahniks straining under the load . She looked like a small army tank racing toward a target . <p> Lady and Sheleeta ordered , then took their food to a table with a window view of Halsey Street . It was dark now , and there was an electricity sparking the night that was both edgy and entertaining , like an open-air carnival . <p> Lady was dividing up the food and napkins when , again , Sheleeta stopped cold . <p> " Not Spicy Tuna again . Let it go , Sheleeta . " Lady had had enough of the Peesonthechaise lament for tonight , and she was hungry . <p> " No ! No ! Look who 's back . " Sheleeta was excitedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big window and saw a beautiful black woman with long legs , clearly defined calves , and firm thighs coming up the street . She had the face of an angel and flawless dark skin , and although she was obviously mature , she still had the ripe body of a teenager-eager , full , and lush . Her breasts stretched the top she was wearing to its fiber limit . She was the stuff wet fantasies were made of . The sexual energy she exuded spilled over beyond gender boundaries . She was clearly distinguishable , even through the manic blur of people now overtaking Halsey Street . <p> Lady turned back to Sheleeta . " You 're right . It is her . It 's Paradise . " <p> Paradise had set herself apart long ago from the other prostitutes on Halsey Street . It was n't about the money for her . She really enjoyed the sex . She had n't run to the streets because her momma did n't understand her or because her daddy did n't love her enough . <p> She wanted the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the soreness of it , the sweet delightful invasion of the body that lasts for days . Paradise brought her love of sex to all her clientele . She had politicians , doctors , lawyers , and a few celebrities begging for her . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
