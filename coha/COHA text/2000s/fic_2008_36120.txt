TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO , they were called nerds . <p> Today , they 're called billionaires . <p> Even among outcasts , Genoa Greeves suffered more than most . Saddled with a weird name-her parents ' love for Italy produced two other children , Pisa and Roma-and a gawky frame , Genoa spent her adolescence in retreat . She talked if spoken to , but that was the extent of her social interaction . Her teenage years were spent in a self-imposed exile . Even the oddest of girls would have nothing to do with her , and the boys acted as if she 'd been stricken by the plague . She remained an island to herself : utterly alone . <p> Her parents had been concerned about her isolation . They has taken her through an endless parade of shrinks who offered multiple diagnoses : depression , anxiety disorder , Asperger 's syndrome , autism , schizoid personality disorder , all of the above in comorbidity . Medication was prescribed : Psychotherapy was five days a week . The shrinks said the rights things , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego bolstering or self-esteem-enhancing exercises could possibly counteract the cruelty of being so profoundly different . When she was sixteen , she fell into a deep depression . Medication began to fail . It was Genoa 's firm opinion that she would have been institutionalized had it not been for two entirely unrelated incidents . <p> As a woman , Genoa had definitely been born without feminine wiles , or any attributes that made girls desirable sexual beings . But if she was n't born with the right female qualities , at least Genoa did have the extremely good fortune to be born at the right time . <p> That is , the computer age . <p> high tech and the personal computer proved to be Genoa 's manna from heaven : chips and motherboards were her only friends . When she spoke to a computer-mainframes at first and then the omnipresent desktops that followed-she found at last that she and an inanimate object were communicating in a language that only the blessed few could readily understand . Technology beckoned , and she answered the summons like a siren 's call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayal , became her most welcome asset . <p> As for her body , well , in Silicon Valley , who cared about that ? The world that Genoa eventually inhabited was one of ingenuity and ideas , of bytes and megabytes and brilliance . Bodies were merely skeletons to support that great thinking machine above the neck . <p> But even growing up at the cutting edge of the computer age was n't a guaranteed passport to success . Achievement was surely destined to elude Genoa had it not been for one individual-other than her parents-who believed in her . <p> Dr. Ben-Bennett Alston Little-was the coolest teacher in high school . His specialty was history with a strong emphasis on political science , but he had been so much more than just an educator , a guidance counselor and the boys ' vice principal . Handsome , tall , and athletic , he had made the girls swoon and had garnered the boys ' respect by being tough but fair . He knew everything about everything and had been universally loved by the twenty-five hundred high school students he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but virtually meaningless to Genoa until that fateful day when she passed him in the hallway . <p> He had smiled at her and said , " Hi , Genoa , how 's it going ? " <p> She had been so stunned she had n't answered , running away , her face burning as she thought , Why would Dr. Ben know my name ? <p> The second time she passed him , she still did n't answer back when he asked " how 's it going ? " but at least she did n't exactly run away . It was more like a fast step that converted into a trot one he was safely down the hall . <p> The third time , she looked down and mumbled something . <p> By the sixth time , she managed to mumble a " hi " back , although she still could n't make eye contact without her cheeks turning bright red . <p> Their first , last , and only actual face-to-face conversation happened when she was a junior . Genoa had been called into his office . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cotton underwear . She wore thick baggy jeans and a sweatshirt , and her frizzy hair had been pulled back into a thick , unwieldy ponytail . <p> " Sit down , Genoa , " he told her . " How are you doing today ? " <p> She could n't answer . He looked serious , and she was too anxiety ridden to ask what she did wrong . <p> " I just wanted to tell you that we got your scores back from the PSAT . " <p> She managed a nod , and he said , " I 'm sure by now that you know that you 're a phenomenal student . I 'm thrilled to report that you got the highest score in the school . You got the highest score , period . A perfect 1600 . " <p> She was still too frightened to talk . Her heart was pumping out of her chest , and her face felt as if it had been burned by a thousand heat lamps . Sweat was pouring off her forehead , dripping down her nose . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . But of course , he probably did . <p> " Do you know how unusual that is ? " Little went on . <p> Genoa knew it was unusual . She was painfully aware of how unusual she was . <p> " I just called you in today because I wanted to say congratulations in person . I expect big things from you , young lady . " <p> Genoa had a vague recollection of muttering a thank-you . <p> Dr. Ben had smiled at her . It had been a big smile with big white teeth . He raked back his sandy blond hair and tried to make eye contact with her , his eyes so perfectly blue that she could n't look at them without being breathless . He said , " People are all different , Genoa . Some are short , some are tall , some are musical , some are artistic , and the rarefied few like you are endowed with incredible brainpower . That head of yours is going to carry you though life , young lady . It 's like the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there , Genoa . You 're going to get there , and I firmly believe you 're going to surpass all your classmates because you have the one organ that ca n't be fixed by plastic surgery . " <p> No comment . His words fell into dead air . <p> Little said , " You 're going to get there , Genoa . You just have to wait for the world to catch up to you . " <p> Dr. Ben stood up . <p> " Congratulations again . We at North Valley High are all very proud of you . You can tell your parents , but please keep it quiet until the official scores are mailed . " <p> Genoa stood and nodded . <p> Little smiled again . " You can go now . " <p> TEN YEARS LATER , from her cushy office on the fourteenth floor looking over Silicon Valley , about to take her morning hot cocoa , Genoa Greeves opened the San Jose Mercury News and read about Dr. Ben 's horrific , execution-style homicide . If she would have been capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , the only encouraging words she had received in high school , rang through her brain . <p> She followed the story closely . <p> The articles that followed emphasized that Bennett Alston Little did n't appear to have an enemy in the world . Progress on the case , slow even in the beginning , seemed to grind to a halt six months later . There were a few " persons of interest " - it should have been " people of interest , " Genoa thought-but nothing significant ever advanced the case toward conclusion . The homicide went from being a front-page story to obscurity , the single exception a note on the anniversary of the homicide . After that , the files became an ice-cold case sitting somewhere within the monolith of what was called LAPD storage . <p> Fifteen years came and went . And then , quite by happenstance , Genoa picked up a copy of the Los Angeles Times and read about a homicide with overtones of Dr. Ben 's murder . When she saw the article , she was sitting in the president 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was housed on the fifteen through the twentieth stories of the Greeves Building in Cupertino . But unlike Dr. Ben 's murder , suspects had been arrested for this carjacking . <p> She wondered ... <p> Then she picked up the phone and called up LAPD . It took a while to get through to the right person , but when she did , she knew she was talking to someone with authority . Though Genoa did n't demand that the Little case be reopened , her intent was crystal . It was true that she had money to hire a battalion of private detectives to investigate the murder herself , but she did n't want to step on anyone 's toes-and why should she shell out money when she paid an exorbitant amount of California state taxes ? Surely the cash that she would have had to expend in private investigations could be put to better use in LAPD , aiding the homicide detectives in their investigation . <p> Lots of money , in fact , should the department decide to reopen the Ben Little homicide and actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sounding appropriately eager and maybe just a tad sycophantic . <p> Genoa wanted to reopen the case to do right by Bennett Alston Little . <p> Genoa wanted to reopen the case because the more recent homicide brought to mind the Little case and she though about a connection . <p> Genoa wanted to reopen the case to bring a murderer to justice . <p> Genoa wanted to reopen the case to bring peace and solace to all of the victims ' friends and families . <p> Genoa wanted to reopen the case because at this stage in her life , and sitting on 1.3 billion dollars , she could do whatever the hell she pleased . <p> Chapter Two THE CONVERSATION WENT like this : " The case is fifteen years old , ' I say . Then Mackinerny responds , ' Strapp , I do n't give a solitary fuck if it 's from the Jurassic era ; there 's a seven-figure endowment riding on this solve , and you 're going to make it happen ' . I respond , ' Not a problem , sir ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought so . " <p> Lieutenant Peter Decker regarded Strapp , who within the last ten minutes seemed to have gained a few more wrinkles from frowning . He was turning sixty this year , but still had the bull frame of a weight lifter . The man had a steel-trap mind and a matching metallic personality . " I 'll do what I can , Captain . " <p> " That 's the idea , Lieutenant . You 'll do what you can . I want you to handle this personally , Decker , not pass it off to someone in Homicide . " <p> " My homicide squad is more up to date on the latest techniques and forensics . They 'd probably do a better job since most of my time is spent doing psychotherapy and scheduling vacations . " <p> " Horseshit ! " Strapp rubbed his eyes . " Last summer you spent way more time in the field than in your office , judging from the amount of overtime you racked up flying Southwest to San Jose and to Santa Fe . Surely you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " We cleared two homicides . " <p> " One of which was twenty-five years old , so this one should be a snap . We 've got a hell of lot riding on this solve . " <p> A potential seven-figure gift could lift LAPD into state of the art . Equipping the department with the newest in forensic machinery could potentially put more felons behind bars . Still , Decker has found that in the end , it was always the human factor : men and women sweating hours on end to extract confessions , noticing a detail that was overlooked , doing just one more interview . <p> Not that technology did n't have its place . And with a big endowment ... <p> Money talks , etc . <p> " What prompted the call ? " Decker asked Strapp . <p> " She read about the Primo Ekerling carjacking in Hollywood and it reminded her of the unfinished business with the Little case . " <p> " Does n't Hollywood have a few cholos in custody for that one ? " <p> " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were similar enough to strike a chord in her very wealthy mind . " <p> " What 's her connection to Little other than the fact that he was her guidance counselor ? " <p> " I think it 's as simple as that . She told Mackinerny that Little was they only one who had been kind to her during her awkward years , and now she has enough money to get people to jump , " Strapp said . " We were both in Foothill when the Little murder happened . From what I remember , he was a good guy . " <p> Decker had n't followed the details closely . He did recall that the case had occupied space in the local newspapers . " How soon do you want me on this ? " <p> " How does yesterday sound , Lieutenant ? Top priority . Got it ? " <p> " Got it , and over and out . " <p> * * * <p> THOUGHT HE COULD N'T delegate the thinking , Decker could certainly dole out the grunt work . He assigned one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of driving from the West Valley to downtown to pick up the Little file . In morning rush-hour traffic that was a heavy one- to tow-hour commute , depending on the amount of Sigalerts on L.A. 's arteries . In the meantime , Decker went over his current assignments , clearing most of his paperwork to devote his attention to the Little case . <p> The department had detectives who worked cold cases routinely , and why they did n't pick this one up was anyone 's guess . Decker suspected that if West Valley got the solve , a substantial slab of the coveted cash would be directed to Strapp . Also , it was logical that the local detectives might have better luck concluding a case that happened in their own backyard . <p> By the time Decker could actually turn his attention to the sic boxes that had been checked out from storage , it was after six in the evening . Too many miscreants had occupied the day , and if he was to get anywhere , he needed solitude to read and think . He decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't proper procedure to carry out official material , it happened all the time . <p> The drive to his house took less than fifteen minutes , down Devonshire Boulevard to his ranch-style wood-sided house . Decker 's property was over a third of an acre , not nearly as big as the ranch he had owned when the Little case broke through to the media , but the space was large enough for him to spread out his workbench on a lovely spring day and play with his tools . The grounds had become a feast for the eyes since Rina had taken up gardening about two years ago . She had turned what had been a boring sheet of green lawn into lush gardens with riotous colors . Last spring , it had made the L.A. Garden list of places to visit . One entire Sunday had been taken up by troupes of gardening aficionados traipsing through his property oohing and aahing and congratulating Rina on a job well done . <p> Upon arriving home , Decker could smell garlic coming from the kitchen . His wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Balancing three of the boxes while fiddling with the front door key , he managed to make an entrance , place the boxes on his dining room table , and not fall on his ass . It was a good sign . <p> Rina emerged from the kitchen , her hair maddeningly black without a hint of gray even though the woman was in her forties . Her lack of aging never ceased to painfully remind Decker that the was in his fifties and had a head streaked with silver . The follicles that retained the most of Decker 's original carrot red coloring were embedded in his mustache . The facial hair was maybe a bit out of style , but Rina claimed it made him look very masculine and handsome , and she was the only one he was still trying to impress . <p> Rina wiped her hands on as dish towel . She pointed to the boxes . " What 's all that about ? " <p> " I got saddled with another cold case , only this one needs a quick solve . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Decker smiled . " Are n't you my good friend . What smells so good ? " <p> " Chicken cacciatore over pasta . I 've loaded it with garlic trying to stave off the current flu bug . My plan is to make it uncomfortable for anyone to get too close to us . But we 'll be okay with each other because we 'll both eat the same entrTe , " <p> " What about our progeny ? Will she be able to some close ? " <p> " Hannah is irrelevant since I basically have n't seen her in three days-the consequence of a driver 's license . She 's at Lilly 's studying for a chemistry test . " <p> Decker brightened . " So we 're all alone ? " <p> " Yes . How about if you clear off the table and I 'll open the wine . I 've picked out a Sangiovese that I found on KosherWine.come . " <p> " Sounds wonderful but just a single glass for me , darlin ' . I 've got to work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still three more in the car . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
