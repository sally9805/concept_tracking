The room was alive . I knew it better than my body . The whole house sighed and shuddered , breathing inaudibly through its doors and windows . <p> In and out , in and out I went , and one existence melted like snow into another . The sun was fierce and crazy . I cooled in green pools or under the shade of gracious trees . Beneath the stalwart moon , luminously impassive , I imagined the world . In my dreams , someone like me , a sprite , shimmered and danced , as dramatic as a noonday shadow . Day leaked into night , and going to bed was my first compromise . <p> Life spread itself before me , lay there like the backyard on a summer morning , the blacktop highway drifting out of town . I saw with my hands , envisioned with my skin , tasted with my eyes . At night the neighbors ' houses shut their doors and lights , and I drew faces and pasted flowers and shells onto sheets of paper . I marked passing moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even then I was captive , and it was uncapturable . So was I. <p> Laughter and fireworks , danger and whispering , skinned knees and fights delighted or stunned me , then metamorphosed into streaks of light and color , unstable images , and memory . All things had lives of their own , distinct from mine and part of mine , too . I was unformed , in a hurry , and always late . Time was the yellow school bus , waiting for me at the corner . <p> Intimations of death and freedom flirted and blinked knowingly . I lay on my back , conjuring tomorrow . The sky appeared to be my plate-glass window to heaven . I 'd go there if I were good . The grass smelled fresh and warm , and I did n't want to leave the earth . I dug my toes in the dirt , startling ants that marched industriously across my naked stomach . Occasionally I glimpsed the future , which was a secret . I 'd have a dog , a figure , a job , know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People said I was a girl with promise . Cross your heart and hope to die . <p> When anonymous breezes caressed me , I trembled , and when finally the wind stirred me , I did n't know its name was lust . Longing was spectral . At first I was a spectator , but I was destined to become one of desire 's permanent guests . What was wanting ? Every inexperienced day , I sought experience and swore allegiance to myself . I practiced no science , though patterns were everywhere . I thought I concocted my own . <p> Time did n't wait forever , and I took the train out of town . I did n't intend to go back . Unpracticed , I learned lyrics to old songs : Walls do n't keep secrets . Roads end . Hope 's necessary . Bridges collapse . Love starts and stops . Promises are made to be broken . Shaken , I settled , only to discover the dictatorship of the temporary . Longing and time were constant , though , and they were companions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impoverished . Still , I tried to save it , enrich it , and , more beggar and thief than savior , returned to it again and again . <p>
