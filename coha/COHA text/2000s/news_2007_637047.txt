<p> Three boys played with fire , police say , and four elderly homeowners lost nearly everything they had . <p> At about the same time the boys  --  the oldest of whom is 11  --  appeared in court Tuesday to face charges of arson and burglary , residents of the Village Place retirement community in Loganville poked through the ashes of the four homes destroyed by a fire that police say the boys started . <p> Police said the boys were visiting their grandmother in Loganville on Sunday when they went to a nearby welding company . They wriggled through a broken window , police said , and stole a trove of cheap tools , including two hammers , a marker , a level , a saw , a clamp , a punch , an oilcan and a disposable lighter . <p> The boys  --  two Lawrenceville brothers who are 7 and 11 and their 10-year-old cousin from Loganville  --  went outside and played for a while in a truck , which they decorated with stars drawn with the marker . Then they went to a kudzu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> According to police , the first fire went out . The boys lit a second fire , and one of them dumped some oil onto the flames . The fire then started to spread rapidly . After trying to stamp it out , the boys panicked and ran . <p> The mother of two of the boys questioned them Sunday about the fire , but they denied having anything to do with it . <p> On Monday , police found sets of small footprints around the truck . Later that day , the mother brought the three boys to the Loganville police station . The boys were crying as they confessed , police said . <p> On Tuesday , the three boys looked scared as they appeared in Walton County Juvenile Court in Monroe . They sat wide-eyed and silent as adults spoke around them during the 15-minute hearing . Their names were not released because of their ages . <p> None of the boys had a history of serious misbehavior , their lawyer , Donna Clement , a public defender , said in court Tuesday . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and commit more offenses , " she said , arguing that their parents should be allowed to keep them at home until the next court hearing , set for March 23 . <p> But Juvenile Court Judge J. Stanley Rhymer ruled that the two older boys would remain in the county 's juvenile detention facility . Rhymer allowed the youngest to return home with his mother . <p> The boys did not immediately react . But when they saw the expressions on their parents ' faces , they began to cry . As did their parents . They stood and hugged one another . <p> Meanwhile , the people in Village Place on Tuesday measured their losses , some of which can be replaced and some which can not . <p> Barbara Hobbs arranged a memorial of flowers and cherub statues in her burnt-out backyard as a memorial to Coco , her Pekingese dog , who died in the fire . " I was at work ; that 's why Coco died , " said Hobbs , a medical X-ray technician . <p> Gerald Stowe said he was cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He was barefoot and wearing shorts . Moments later , he was nearly overcome by smoke that was pouring into his house . <p> " It was amazing , " Stowe said . " The fire hit the back fence in his backyard and it was on the roof in no time . The smoke was so thick , I could barely see my pants to get my car keys . " <p> Tuesday , Stowe returned to see what could be salvaged . He did n't stay long . <p> Through the open space that used to be his wall , about all that was recognizable inside was a bookshelf heavily stocked with now-waterlogged Stephen King titles . " I do n't even have a picture left of my mother and father , " Stowe said . <p> Stowe said he and the other three homeowners plan to rebuild in Village Place . He wishes for the boys to be able to rebuild their futures as well . " I hope they 're not going to lock those kids up for this , " Stowe said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident Lois Bowles and a friend had not been walking around the neighborhood Sunday afternoon . <p> Bowles recalled Tuesday that on her first pass through the area , there was n't a hint of smoke in the air . On her second pass , perhaps 15 minutes later , they could see some smoke rising beyond the fence line , she said . <p> Her friend went to the fence and saw the grass fires building in the kudzu patch . They called 911 and started banging on doors , Bowles taking the south side of the block and her friend the north . <p> " It was just a small fire then , " she said . " But then that little fire started going up to the treetops and it got out of control , like it was feeding on itself . It just went house to house . " <p> The 40 or so firefighters who responded to the alarm did well to contain the damage to four houses destroyed and six damaged , she said . " At the rate it was going , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bowles said . <p> On the evening of the fire and throughout much of the next day , the neighborhood was beset by gawkers . <p> By Tuesday , the neighborhood was quiet again , though an acrid smell lingered in the air . Besides the homeowners on their often futile salvage missions , practically the only people who came to Village Place were attorneys , contractors , Red Cross officials and reporters . <p> Ellanore Brack , who lives across the street from the burned homes , brought out homemade chocolate chip cookies for neighbors and visitors alike . <p> She said she was relieved that no one was seriously hurt , but distressed over everything that was irrevocably lost . <p> " This is where the memories are , in these houses , " Brack said , pointing to the burnt-out shells of the former homes . <p> " We 're the ones who hold the memories , " she said , referring to the older people who live in Village Place . " We have everything that means anything . "
