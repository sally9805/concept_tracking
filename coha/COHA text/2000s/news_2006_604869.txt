<p> As Americans debate the direction of the country , USA TODAY asked two prominent governors to discuss the mood in their states , the war in Iraq , the challenges of health care and their own future plans . Republican Gov . Mike Huckabee of Arkansas , chairman of the National Governors Association , and Democratic Gov . Bill Richardson of New Mexico , chairman of the Democratic Governors Association , spoke Friday at the J.D. Power convention in Orlando . The forum was moderated by Susan Page , USA TODAY 's Washington Bureau chief . Comments have been edited for space and clarity . <p> On the nation 's mood <p> Huckabee : I 'm not sure if I could explain why people feel pessimistic in many ways , because in our own state , we just completed the 18th consecutive month of record revenues and the lowest unemployment rate we 've ever had . <p> Now , granted our farmers are having some real problems related to high diesel prices and record drought this past year . I think there is an overall sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see their hometown soldiers deployed for battle , that creates a sense of angst . <p> But really , in many ways , ultimately Americans are driven by one of two things : fear or hope . Fear drives people for the short term . But ultimately , it 's hope that drives Americans for the long term . I believe that the most important thing to find again is our sense of hope and optimism for the future . <p> Richardson : New Mexicans feel that the state is moving in the right direction . And nationally , they feel the opposite . I 've never seen the trust in government as low as I have , I believe , with the ( Hurricane ) Katrina response , the gridlock in Congress , the fighting . Regardless of what position or what party you 're in , I think Americans are very frustrated with nothing happening , nothing in terms of energy policy , the economy , health care . <p> On the war in Iraq <p> Gov . Huckabee , you just returned from Iraq 10 days ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense that you only hear what 's going wrong . There are a lot of things going right with that effort . And there is a significant increase in the Iraqi security forces taking over the control of securing their borders . It 's not a perfect situation . War never is . It 's not pretty . It can be messy . <p> Having said that , there are two observations that I made : No. 1 , we 're in this for a much longer period of time , I think , than some people are being led to believe . And out of necessity , it 's going to take time , because to bring stability to the Middle East and to bring some level of security , there is going to be a significant transition process . <p> But the second thing is that in the long term , it is absolutely imperative that we succeed there . For us to pull out and to leave those people who have put their necks on the line for freedom , democracy and a stable government , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nothing less than to leave them exposed to some level of genocide . <p> Gov . Richardson , do you think the American people are being given an unfairly negative picture of what 's going on ? <p> Richardson : I supported the president when he went in . But I am disappointed . We do n't have an exit strategy . I worry about the equipment of our armed forces . I worry that there is no end game . I do n't favor a pullout date , but I believe we have to have a timetable for Iraq to take over security and civil administration . And we do n't have that . <p> At the same time , I believe that whatever you may think about the war in Iraq , we 've been obsessed with it to the detriment of other huge foreign policy concerns in the region . <p> One is Iran . And I believe right now we 're pursuing the correct policy : diplomacy through the United Nations , potential sanctions so that they do n't develop a nuclear weapon . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a big problem . We 've also got problems in North Korea  --  threats of nuclear proliferation . What are we going to do as a country with the international community to deal with international terrorism ? I think our alliances , NATO , are fractured . ... I think it 's important that we rally around the troops , we rally around the administration , but also demand answers . <p> And , yes , I do think sometimes the media portray the negative . But still , the situation is not stable . There does n't seem to be an exit strategy . There does n't seem to be a plan . <p> Gov . Huckabee , you said that we may be in Iraq for a longer period of time than some people think . Just your best estimate , how long do you mean ? <p> Huckabee : If we look at even our participation in World War II , we were decades in Japan and Germany and the rest of Europe . ... I think it 's unrealistic to think that we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-digit years in that part of the Middle East . Now , I do n't think we 're going to be there with 180,000 troops . It may be an ever-diminishing amount of U.S. troops and forces there . But I do believe we need to have a more realistic and honest assessment and prepare the people of America for the necessity of staying there until the job is done and done right . <p> Gov . Richardson , do you agree that it will be decades  --  more than " single-digit years "  --  that we 'll still see U.S. involvement in Iraq ? <p> Richardson : Well , I hope not . I think eventually we have to say , " Iraq , people of Iraq , security forces of Iraq , it 's your show , and let 's have a transition period . " So , no , my hope is that there is eventually an American exit . <p> On the lessons of Katrina <p> Has the experience with Katrina brought any lessons about what help you can realistically expect to get from the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Huckabee : You felt a sense of helplessness as an American citizen watching those folks struggling and , in essence , abandoned on Interstate 10 . <p> My own experience was we started deciding that FEMA stood for Forget Expecting Meaningful Answers , because we were n't getting any . And we had to essentially make up our own rules . I found that it 's easier to get forgiveness than permission when dealing with the federal government . And often governors have to take the bull by the horns and take care of needs and focus on people , not paperwork . <p> We really do need to rethink the idea of putting FEMA under the overall banner of Homeland Security . I know that may be sacrilege within some corners of my own party , but it just is n't working like it ought to be working . <p> Gov . Richardson , what lessons did you draw ? <p> Richardson : The first one was that we as a state of New Mexico better have a plan of our own because ... we 'll have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I , too , support a major overhaul . I believe there was a mistake to take FEMA and put it under Homeland Security . I think it has to be a Cabinet-level agency directly connected to the White House for immediate action . <p> You have to have a complete change . And at the same time , you ca n't neglect states . And I agree with Gov . Huckabee . And this is where I believe governors and state policy is where you make significant change in this country . We have to balance budgets by law . We have to deal with health care , with creating jobs , with building roads , with making schools better . <p> On energy policy <p> Richardson : Here is what I would do : A massive public and private investment to develop new technologies , particularly renewable technology . Fuel efficiency in our automobiles . We 're not doing it . Detroit and some of the automakers resist this . <p> And this is wrong . We have to find ways through technology to be more fuel-efficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy . We had a program with Ford or GM where you have collaborative efforts to make the SUV fuel-efficient . ... We ca n't keep resisting this . We have to have conservation efforts ( in ) refrigerators , air conditioners . ... The government has to purchase hybrid vehicles . <p> My point is that there are a lot of investments that we 're not making in solar , wind , biomass , hydrogen fuel cells , renewable technology , ethanol , that need to happen . And it 's going to take a president with his bully pulpit to say this needs to take place . <p> On faith and politics <p> Huckabee : I think the role for conservative Christians is the same it should be for liberal Christians or for liberal Muslims or conservative Muslims or for conservative or liberal people of the Jewish faith . If , in this country , a person is a person of faith , it should not propel him to a special role or voice , but it should not also cause that person to have that voice shut away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . I 'm an evangelical . I 've never made any apologies for that . I think I bring a certain perspective to the role of politics . But that perspective is , I believe every person is important . I think we have a responsibility to view every person as a unique creation of the Creator . And that means we must treat people with dignity and respect , that we have to be concerned just as much with the poorest person in our community as we are with the wealthiest . <p> In a representative form of government , all points of view should be represented . Not more equally , but by the same token , not less equally . But I also say it 's important that we are inclusive , that we do n't consider that we have a right to extract certain voices from the public square . And that 's where the line has to be drawn . <p> On health care <p> Huckabee : What America desperately needs is a cultural shift to where we move from the thought that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on treating diseases  --  to focusing on health , which means that we prevent those diseases in the first place by not smoking , by maintaining normal body weight and eating healthy and maintaining activity levels . That adds years to a person 's life . It means they are less likely to end up with hypertension , diabetes , heart disease and a host of things that cost most of us our dollars . <p> Health care and health is no longer a health issue . It 's the No. 1 driving economic issue in the country . GM this year spends more money purchasing health care for its employees than it does purchasing steel . The fact is , when you sell a car , you 're not really selling a car . You 're taking money to help provide the health benefits for the people who built it . The car is the gift for having provided the health care . <p> Gov . Richardson , you have declared 2006 " The Year of the Child " in New Mexico , which includes a focus on health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in " The Year of the Child " is the following : One , eliminate junk food from schools . And we 're doing it to the point where there are no carbonated drinks . ... Physical education in every elementary school . A healthy breakfast for every kid . But then also insuring kids  --  we ca n't insure everybody in New Mexico . It 's impossible . We do n't have the resources . ... So what we 're doing is focusing on insuring kids from zero to 5 . Every kid . <p> On 2008 <p> Have you made a decision to run for president ? <p> Huckabee : It would be disingenuous , I think , for either one of us to say , no , we never thought about it . ... Chances are neither of us would be in Orlando , Fla. , standing here today if we never thought about it . And we could say that we both enjoy winter in Iowa and New Hampshire , and this is why we 've been going up there quite frequently . <p> I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would say to me that to be in a position where people actually put your name forward and put you on the list is an incredibly humbling and amazing thing . And you ca n't ignore that . <p> Having said that , I have n't made a decision . ... And I 'm not going to until probably maybe sometime this time next year , because I want to finish my term as governor , which to the delight of many in my state will conclude next January . ... And if I feel I 've got something to offer to my party and my country that is significant , then I very well may be on that list . <p> Richardson : Well , Gov . Huckabee is my Republican candidate . <p> Huckabee : If this keeps up , we 're going to have a political version of Brokeback Mountain up here . ( Laughter ) <p> Richardson : I love being governor . It 's the best job I 've ever had . You can actually do things and help people . That 's priority one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at it . I 'm going to see what options are . I have an unfinished agenda : education , economic development and health care in New Mexico . That 's priority one . <p> But what I want to spend the rest of this year and whatever time I have in the political arena is making my party , changing my party . ... I want the Democratic Party to be acceptable to the business community , that we stand for economic growth and competitiveness . ... You have the private sector as the main engine , but with social justice .
