IF YOU 'VE EVER WANTED TO SEE A PLANet so bright your jaw will drop , this is your month . Venus is the planet . Even casual skywatchers may notice Venus in the western sky a few minutes before sunset - a good time to look at its dramatic crescent form in a telescope . As dusk starts to fade , this unrivaled heavenly lamp can scarcely be missed . But Venus is not the only planet of high interest this month . Far up in the south at nightfall , brilliant Jupiter and Saturn lead the bright winter constellations like two pilot ships in a fleet of radiant stars . And if you look to the south at daybreak , there 's another fascinating sight : Mars entering Scorpius and about to outshine the Scorpion 's heart star , Antares . Venus , at greatest elongation on January 16-17 , continues to cast its radiance from high above tree lines onto snowy fields in northern lands . The interval between sunset and Venus-set shrinks from four to three hours as seen from midnorthern latitudes this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightens to magnitude - 4.6 late in February . Not quite the same as Venus 's peak brightness is an event recently identified by Mark Gingrich of San Leandro , California . He calls it the " greatest illuminated extent " ( GIE ) : the moment when we get to see the most square arcseconds of Venus illuminated in a telescope . During an evening apparition , Venus 's disk grows as it nears Earth , but the crescent thins as the planet approaches the Earth-Sun line of sight . According to Gingrich , the best combination leads to GIE on the evening of February 21 st in the Americas . We can then observe 331 square arcseconds of the disk 's sunlit surface , about 80 square arcseconds more than we could a month earlier and 25 more than we will when Venus reaches a second GIE in the morning sky in May . // The Moon diagrams in the calendar show the Moon 's phase in the evening when waxing or full , and in the early-morning hours of the date when waning .

Jean Meeus predicted events involving Jupiter 's satellites and the conjunctions of stars and planets . // Even with such a generous expanse of Venus to observe , the gray markings in the planet 's cloud cover remain quite subtle . Look around sunset , when the sky is brighter and Venus 's crescent is less dazzling than it becomes after dark . Also watch for signs of the mysterious ashen light - a still-unexplained illumination that some observers have occasionally noticed in parts of Venus 's night side . Saturn and Jupiter appear in the south at dusk accompanied by two naked-eye star clusters ( the Pleiades and Hyades ) and an entourage of other bright stars . Both planets are receding and fading Saturn is now outshone by Capella and Rigel - but are nonetheless brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the stars , with the faster Jupiter pulling away from Saturn . This is the last month for two decades that you 'll be able to fit the pair together in binoculars . Both planets reach eastern quadrature ( 900 from the Sun ) , making them cast shadows farther to the east , as seen in a telescope , on Saturn 's grand rings and Jupiter 's big moons . Mercury fades and falls out of the evening sky ( inferior conjunction with the Sun is on February 13th ) and has n't gotten high enough up before dawn for most observers to see by month 's end . Neptune was at conjunction with the Sun on January 26th , as is Uranus on February 9th , so neither is observable this month . Pluto is accessible for several hours before dawn but is so dim and difficult that few people will be tempted to try for it in February . Mars rises well after midnight , around the time Jupiter and Saturn are setting . The best time to view it is really around dawn , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beginning to get a bit exciting . It passes only 3 ' south of Beta Scorpii around Ih Universal Time on February 21st and is still close when it rises before dawn in the Americas . More significantly , Mars becomes noticeably brighter than Antares by month 's end and grows a little in telescopes . Most observers wo n't see any markings on this approaching planet yet , but if your image is crisp you may notice that Mars , being at western quadrature , appears decidedly gibbous now . The Moon forms a lovely line with Saturn and Jupiter on the evening of February Ist and is fairly near Jupiter the next night . Look for a waning half-Moon just upper left of Mars on February 15th . In the evening sky late in the month , the waxing lunar crescent is far to the lower left of Venus on February 25th and about one fist left of the planet the next day . On the last evening of the month , the Moon approaches Saturn and Jupiter again . The three form a crooked line .

Local time of transit tells when objects cross the meridian at midmonth ; transits occur an hour later on the list , an hour earlier at month 's end . Sidebar Night of the Venus Green Flashes Sidebar It was dusk on May 20,1997 . I stood by a deserted road a few hundred yards from a local lighthouse . As I watched , the turning Earth made Venus descend ever so slowly to the lower right , toward the slanted south roof of the lighthouse . I put Sidebar 7 x 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof , its last light briefly turned a distinct blue-green ! A green flash at the last second of a sunset , caused by short wavelengths being refracted higher than long ones , is a famous though rarely seen phenomenon . But now , by taking a few steps diagonally backward ( to maintain the roof 's angle of attack ) I was able , again and again , to create a green flash of Venus . It did require magnification ; this was not a naked-eye sight . But I could also produce it by gently stooping . A few minutes and few dozen flashes later , I ran out of space to back up . I 've tried to duplicate this feat since , without luck . But that first night the lighthouse had magic , and I the power of an enchanter .
