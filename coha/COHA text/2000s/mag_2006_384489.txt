( Out March 21 ) Game THE GODFATHER : THE GAME ( EA ; PS2 , Xbox , PC ; Mature ) We 're still not sure what to make of this Grand Theft Auto-style adaptation of one of the best movies of all time . While film purists will scoff at how it mucks with the story line by adding you as a Corleone foot soldier , gamers will revel in the open-world environment where you snuff out rivals and extort the local barber .

Albarn is a co-owner of Honest Jons Records , which releases consistently cool world music , the latest being a pair of Nigerian-centric compilations . Gathering highlife , juju , and Afrobeat from the ' ' 60s through the ' ' 80s , these discs serve up jittery percussion volleys , elegant dance grooves , and loads of call-and-response chants .

" ( Both out now ) AS TEMPLAR NITES Moonlighting from destructo-metallers the Icarus Line , Souls She Said singer Joe Cardamone and guitarist Don Devore explore their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is darkly malevolent .

TOUR Emo means more than wearing a black-logo T-shirt and a tear , my friend . Emo means buying the fifth volume of the Take Action !

It also means attending TA 's tour  --  headlined by Matchbook Romance  --  which is trekking across the country through April . And did we mention that 10 percent of the tour gross goes to suicide-prevention groups ? ( takeactiontour.com ) Game 24 : THE GAME ( 2K Games ; PS2 ; Mature ) For a show slavishly obsessed with haste , 24 has been painfully deliberate in its arrival on the videogame scene  --  about 38,000 Jack Bauer hours by our count .

So why not use a Neth as an excuse to cue up something ethereal  --  may we suggest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of function in art ?
