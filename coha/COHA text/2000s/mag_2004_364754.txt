In Columbia , Mo. , a lot of people are trying  --  really trying  --  to get their neighbors biking and walking . In case you have n't heard , exercise has many advantages . For anyone trying to keep off weight , the simple activity of putting one foot in front of another is surprisingly useful . So in mid-May , Mayor Darwin Hindman , who at 71 still bikes to work , kicked off Bike , Walk and Wheel Week to coax residents to commute and shop without cars . Mayor Hindman and local Congressman Kenny Hulshof led dozens of cyclists on a 4-mile ride . A week later , volunteers were serving breakfast all over town for anyone walking , cycling or rolling in a wheelchair . <P> There 's just one problem . If you want to travel by foot or even by bike in Columbia , it 's not that easy to get where you need to go . Most of the homes are n't located anywhere near stores . And just walking around the neighborhood can be a challenge , since more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local planning and zoning commission proposed an ordinance that would require broad pedestrian and cycling paths along new and rebuilt streets . But the town council tabled the measure until more could be learned about potential costs , promising to take a second look at it in June . <P> " Everyone is created to walk , " says Mayor Hindman . " But we have designed our streets to create barriers to an obvious , efficient activity . " Columbia is not alone . Throughout most of the U.S. , suburban sprawl has created a nation that has been supersized beyond walking distance . Homes tend to be far removed from shopping ; compact , walkable downtowns are rare ; traffic is fast and dangerous to pedestrians ; and even sidewalks are n't to be taken for granted . Researchers will tell you that most Americans will not walk anyplace that 's more than a quarter-mile away . In a recent poll , 44% of people questioned said it was difficult to walk to any destination from their home  --  any destination at all . <P> For a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. cities and suburbs have been getting louder in recent years . Anybody stuck two hours in commuter traffic can tell you some of those reasons . But researchers have begun to recognize a previously unsuspected drawback to the way the U.S. is constructed . What they have found is a connection between sprawling suburbs and spreading waistlines . Very simply , people who live in communities where it 's hard to get anywhere on foot are heavier than those who live in less car-dependent settings , whether densely settled cities like Boston and Chicago or just pedestrian-friendly towns . While diet remains an important factor in the obesity epidemic , it 's becoming increasingly clear that Americans are shaped partly by how America is shaped .
