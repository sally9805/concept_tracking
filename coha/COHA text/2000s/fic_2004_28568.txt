Chapter One " Did you discover anything being a woman ? " Didi asked me when I appeared in front of her . The body-disappearing thing still made me crazy . Twenty-five years as a mob capo ordering hits and living large had not prepared me for life after death . I 'd cut a deal with God , or rather with Didi , God 's emissary at the Pearly Gates . And now I was a freakin ' matchmaker to the lovelorn . It was n't as bad as I made out to Didi , but the skinny-angel broad got on my nerves and I did n't want her to know that I actually liked doing these good deeds . However , I did n't like the surprise she 'd left me with last time , sending me to Earth in a woman 's body . No man should ever have that experience . " I did n't , " I answered her . " This time I want an assignment where I get to be a guy . Not an old fart , either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't like her tone . But then , I did n't have to like her . Staying up here , instead of going to hell , was a heck of a deal . " Let 's skip to the good part . Just give me one where I can be a guy . " A large pile of file folders materialized on the desk . I took pride in the fact that though the stack still was big , it was lighter by two . She smiled at me , which I did n't trust . Despite being an angel , this one had a mean streak in her . " How about one in Vegas ? " she asked . Now I really did n't trust her when she was being nice to me . " Am I going to be a showgirl ? " She laughed . She was n't half-bad-looking when she smiled . " Not this time . " She was trying to scare me again . It was n't going to work . I 'd faced a man with a loaded Glock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Special . The word echoed in my head and I shuddered . Merda , I did n't know if getting to heaven was worth all of this . " How special ? " " You 'll see , " was all she said . I opened the file and scanned it . The chick , Kylie Smith , was a secretary from Los Angeles . The guy , Deacon Prescott - he was my kind of guy . He 'd grown up on the streets and worked as an enforcer for the Vegas mob . " This one does n't look so tough , " I said to Didi . " Good . Then you wo n't have any problems . " My body dissolved before I could retaliate . Didi liked having the last word . But that was okay . I was on the Vegas strip , standing in front of one of the newer casinos , and for the first time since I 'd died , I felt like my fate was n't so bad . * * * Deacon Prescott leaned closer to the ten-inch security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features were indistinguishable . But every other detail was perfect . Her brown hair was caught at the back of her neck ; her clothing was understated - elegant . He zoomed the camera in for a closer look . " Perfect , " he muttered . She was everything he 'd been searching for . She had classic bone structure and a sedate hairstyle , everything he 'd been hoping to find in a wife and never expected to see in the lobby of his hotel/casino , the Golden Dream . She surveyed the lobby . Damn . She was probably here with a boyfriend or husband . He adjusted the camera 's zoom lens - she was n't wearing a wedding ring . Her green eyes were wide-set and her features delicate . She was an ordinary woman in the real world , but out of place in the garish world that was his life . At thirty-eight it was well past time for him to settle down and start a family . And the only thing that had been holding him up was the right woman . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without engaging his emotions . If he 'd learned anything from a lifetime in Vegas , it was that fortune changed on the roll of the dice . Happiness in life and forever love were only illusions . " What are you staring at ? " Deacon glanced over his shoulder at Hayden MacKenzie - Mac to his friends . Mac owned the Chimera Casino and Resort . The Chimera was the second-most successful operation in Vegas behind the Golden Dream . ( Continues ... )
