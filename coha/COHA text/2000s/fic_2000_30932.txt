I was only twenty-two and already I was infamous . I read the gossip pages with terror in my heart , certain I would find some humiliating detail about my recent downfall . I walked the streets with my eyes peeled , ever on the lookout for hidden paparazzi . I entered my local caf with my sphincter tight , counting the seconds until a stranger recognized me , shouted my name , and mocked me for my crime , a crime no one understood , because of my adamant and prolonged silence on the matter . I was the Hester Prynne of downtown . A public laughing-stock at an age when my biggest worry should have been my lack of health insurance . Shamed before my time , defamed without good cause , a huge red letter branded on my ( sizable ) chest . Yet somehow it all made sense . I had always wanted to become someone who could walk into a room and have her reputation precede her . That 's what I got . In the worst way . I did n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to be an actress . The day after graduation , I moved into my parents ' apartment in Brooklyn Heights and called my agent , Faye Glass . She had represented me since I was fourteen , and helped me book a few off-off-Broadway plays and an anticrack commercial during high school , but by senior year my career was n't exactly promising enough to make it worth postponing college . So I let my contract expire , went off to Brown , and told Faye I 'd be in touch in four years . I do n't think she realized I meant it literally , because when I got her on the phone that day in May and told her my name , she said , " Who ? " " Ariel Steiner , " I repeated insistently . " You represented me when I was a kid . I finished college , I 'm ba body . If Faye said I was fat , then I was . I had to lose the weight or choose another career , and I was n't going to choose another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 1976 , when I was two . My parents had taken me to my grandparents ' house in Philadelphia for Thanksgiving , and after dinner the whole family gathered in the living room for the entertainment segment , where all the kids showed off their latest accomplishments . As my three-year-old cousin Eddie belted " Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree " into a microphone , I sat in the corner , watching them all watch him , and was seized by a jealous rage . I could n't stand the sight of so many people paying so much attention to someone who was n't me . Then I got a brilliant idea . As Eddie continued to sing , I slowly and quietly began to strip off all my clothes . Everyone was so focused on him they did n't notice what I was doing . As soon as I was in the buff , I jumped in front of him with a loud " Ta-da ! " and the entire room burst into fits of hysterical laughter . Eddie had been totally forgotten . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest bit guilty for stealing his limelight . I just felt like justice had been served . But now justice would have to be delayed until I lost my extra poundage . I wiped the tears off my face , bought a Slim-Fast at a Korean deli , and got on the subway home . Brooklyn Heights is a quaint , old-fashioned neighborhood known for its tree-lined streets and elegant turn-of-the-century brownstones . I did n't grow up in one of those brownstones . I grew up in a three-bedroom apartment on the thirty-fifth floor of a middle-income apartment building , Silver Tower , that was built in August 1973 . I once looked up Silver Tower in a Brooklyn history book and it was described as " a blot on the otherwise attractive landscape of the neighborhood . " Sad to say , that 's pretty accurate . The railings on the terraces look like prison bars , the concrete is gray-brown and ribbed like a condom , and the entire phallic palace is the biggest eyesore in a twenty-block radius . The only thing that makes the apartment halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you lean all the way out and look toward the left , you can see the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges , and from my bedroom you can spot the Statue of Liberty . When I got home , my mom was in the kitchen , chopping vegetables and listening to All Things Considered . " How was Faye 's ? " she said . " She ca n't send me out on any ingenue parts till I lose fifteen pounds . " " She really said you have to lose fifteen pounds ? " said my mom , horrified . " Yeah . " " Because I think ten would be more than enough . " " Thanks , " I said , went into my room , and shut the door . I lay down on the bed , closed my eyes , and fantasized about the day my skinny , perfect ass would be on the cover of Rolling Stone . It would n't take long . Once I lost the weight , Faye would send me on an audition for a murderous , conniving bitch part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The casting director would be so blown away by my venomous appeal that she 'd hire me on the spot . As soon as we shot the episode , every casting office in town would start buzzing about me , and before the show even aired , George C. Wolfe of the Public Theater would cast me in his next star-studded production  --  as Lady Macbeth to Will Smith 's Macbeth . Once we opened , Ben Brantl ey would cream all over me in the New York Times , and Hollywood would start calling . I 'd get a walk-on in the new George Clooney vehicle shooting in New York , and then Woody would cast me as his mute fourteen-year-old mail-order bride in his Untitled Winter Project . Although I would n't have any actual lines , my face and body would be so expressive that I 'd get nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar . I 'd bring my father as my date , and when Jack Palance opened the envelope and announced me as the winner , I 'd run up to the stage in strapless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad drowning in a sea of his own mucus . I 'd follow my Oscar-winning role with the girl roles in Speeds 4 and 5 and Insanely Indecent Proposals . Julia would become a has-been , Julianne a nobody , Juliette yesterday 's news . Winona and Gwyneth would become my best buddies . I 'd help Gwyn with her eating disorder and convince Winona to change her last name back to Horowitz , and the three of us would become the reigning Jewish Girl Power Mafia of Hollywood . Under our influence , Reform Judaism would become the most popular celebrity religion and Scientology would die out forever . I 'd start my own production company , Zaftig Pictures , and produce chick-friendly scripts with completely one-dimensional roles for men . I 'd be the first woman to start asking twenty-five mil a pic . Time would put me on the cover , saying I was changing the rules of Hollywood . Brown would award me an honorary doctorate and I 'd go back to campus to give a speech about female empowerment in a male-dominated world . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and did a beauty pageant wave , remem bering the day when Faye had told me I was Just Too Fat . I must have dozed off , because I was awakened by my brother , Zach , standing over me , saying , " Hello , blubber . " He was in his junior year at Stuyvesant High School and going through his smart-assed-prick stage . " Mom told you ? " I said . " Yeah . " " Do you think I need to lose weight ? Be honest . " " Well , I 've never wanted to say anything to you , but you have put on a few pounds over the last couple years . I think the diet 's a good thing . It 's an excuse to make yourself more attractive . " Zach could be sharp sometimes . He cracked , but he cracked wise . We went to the dinner table and started in on our fruit cocktail , and then my dad walked in . He kissed my mother , but not me . Since I hit puberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid we embraced all the time , but as soon as I started developing , I stopped feeling comfortable around him . Then , when I got over my puberty weirdness , I did n't know how to go back to kissing him again , because that would have been admitting I 'd been wrong not to kiss him , and you can never admit to your parents that you were wrong . " What did Faye have to say ? " he asked , sitting down at the table . I told him . " I see , " he said , then began contorting his eyebrows violently . He has a bushy black beard and I 've never seen his lips , but I can always tell what he 's feeling by his forehead . " Do n't worry , " I said . " It 'll be OK . It 's only fifteen pounds . I do n't think it 'll take me that long to lose it . " " I do n't either , " he said . But for the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just asked Zach a bunch of questions about his physics class , as I shoveled down the kasha varnishke s my mom had made for me , and pretended to like it . The next morning I made an appointment to interview at a temp agency on Wall Street . I had gotten its name off the front page of the Sunday New York Times classifieds . The ad was diabolical , but it worked . Want to be a Star ? it said , in bold caps . And on the next line , in much smaller letters , " Then sign up with Dynamic Associates for flexible , temporary work . " When I walked in the office , a coiffed fortyish woman introduced herself as Frances , took me into a conference room in the back , and had me fill out some employment history forms . Then she led me into another room , where I took the typing , word processing , and grammar tests . The last was the most humiliating . It consisted of retard-level questions like " Which is correct ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DC , ( c ) Washington , D.C. , ( d ) Washington dc " and " Pick the choice that defines or is most like the word collate. ( a ) destroy , ( b ) separate , ( c ) assemble , ( d ) moisten . " I wondered what they did to the people who got that one wrong . Was there a special torture room in the back where they forced you to do huge mass mailings for hours on end , until the meaning of collate was forever embedded in your mind ? When I finished the tests , Frances took me back into her office and tabulated my results . " You need some work on your word processing skills , " she said , " but your grammar is good and you type seventy-five , which is excellent . I 'm going to try to get you something for tomorrow . " By the time I got home from the agency she had already left a message on my machine about an assignment . I 'd be the secretary to a fin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Thirty-second and Park Avenue South . The rate was $18 an hour  --  more than I 'd gotten for any job in my life . My boss greeted me in the lobby of the building . She was six feet tall with shoulder-length blond hair , and she introduced herself as Ashley Ginsburg . I could guess by that name that she was a shiksa who 'd married a Jew , and despised her immediately for stealing one of our boys  --  my own occasional shaygitz suckerdom aside . She took me upstairs to the twelfth floor and led me to my desk . It was in a small dingy room with a window overlooking Park Avenue South . " This is my office , " she said , pointing to a door to the right of the desk . " Do n't walk in on me unannounced or when I 'm on the phone . " She showed me how to transfer a call and work the intercom , turned on my computer , gave me a user ID , and disappeared into her office . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if Faye had left a message . Nothing . For the next two and a half hours , the Corposhit did n't come out of her office once . I sat at the desk staring at my watch , looking out the window , daydreaming , and checking the machine once every fifteen minutes . At eleven-fifty , just as I was on my way out to lunch , I dialed one more time and struck gold : " Ariel , it 's Faye . I got you an audition for Book ' Em tomorrow at six . Please call . " I could n't believe my fantasy was coming true so quickly ! But when I called her back she said the role was " a chunky young woman who works as a cashier and studies part-time at City College , " and I realized it might take some time before my dream became reality . On my lunch break I took the b us to the casting office and picked up the sides . They were in a folder titled " Fat Cashier " and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my grocery store and I had to explain to the cops what she looked like . I tried to rehearse the scene on the ride back to work , but it was n't too easy to find deep motivation for lines like " All 's I know is he bought radicchio . " I practiced the scene three times that night with Zach , until I felt confident about my read , and the next day after work I went into the ladies ' room , changed into baggy pants and a sweatshirt , and took the bus to the audition . The waiting area was teeming with gorgeous slender girls , so I knew right away they were auditioning for the conniving murderess part . Maybe there was an advantage to going up for fat roles : the competition was n't as stiff . After twenty minutes the casting director finally called me into her office . There were two chairs opposite her desk  --  a cushy one in the center of the room and a hard-backed metal one in the corner . " Sit wherever you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chair choice affect my chances ? Was this a secret psychology trick to see what personality type I was ? I weighed my options : I knew if I chose the comfy one I 'd sink down into it and give a low-energy reading , but if I sat in the metal one I 'd be too far away from the casting director to connect . So I picked up the cushy one , heaved it to the corner , and moved the metal one over in its place . " Interesting choice , " she said . " Thanks . " We ran through the scene together and when we finished she said , " You 're clearly talented , and I know you could do it . Whether we cast you is simply going to depend on what the producers want . If they decide to go overweight , we 'll have to go with someone else . " " Excuse me ? " I said . " If the producers want us to cast someone heavy , we 're not going to go with you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked out . The next day Faye left me a message saying I had a callback on Monday at one-fifteen at the production office in Chelsea , with the producers and director . As soon as she said the word " callback , " I let out a yelp of glee . Then I hung up and rang the Corposhit on the intercom . " Yes ? " she huffed . " I need to talk to you about something . Can I come in ? " " All right . " I walked into her office . " I 'm wondering if I can take a long lunch tomorrow . " " Why ? " " I 'm actually an actress , and I have a callback . " I could n't resist a little self-satisfied smile . " What 's it for ? " " Book ' Em . " Her eyes bugged out . " I watch that show every week ! Would you get to meet Barry Rinaldi if you got the part ? " " Yes , " I said proudly . " In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that OK ? " " Sure , " she said , still looking slightly incredulous . Then she suddenly seemed to realize she was being nice to her underling , reassumed her permagrimace , and said , " Close the door behind you . " The afternoon of the audition , I changed into the same clothes I 'd worn to the first audition ( they say you always should ) and took the train to Chelsea . Some of the same model-type girls from the first audition were in the waiting room , stretching their legs and mouthing their lines . I sat down between two of them , trying not to be distracted by their burgeoning breasts , and read my scene over to myself . Then the casting director called me in . Behind a long table in a huge , airy studio were four middle-aged men . I did n't let them intimidate me , though . I read the scene with even more hostile , jaded-cashier energy than I 'd been able to summon the first time . At the end they smiled , impressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like you , they do n't fake it . When I got out on the street , I called Faye . " It went really well , " I said . " I think I have a good chance , but the casting director said they wo n't cast me if they decide to go with someone heavy . She said I 'm not heavy at all . " " Face it , Ariel , " said Faye . " I sent you on an audition for a fat part , and you got called back . " I did n't wind up booking it , but I was n't discouraged . I would spend the next few months losing weight and doing the obese girl circuit , and then Faye would start sending me out on ingenue parts , and I 'd take the world by storm . But over the next month , as I stuck to my coffee , yogurt , and skinless chicken diet and narrowed to 137 pounds , Faye did n't get me one more audition . Whenever I called to check in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many character roles for young women . I 'll send you out on anything you 're right for . You have to just be patient and trust me . " I have never been good at being patient . Every single thing I 've achieved in life has come to me because I am not a patient person . I ran for the morning-announcements position in high school with no school government experience and won because I wrote a funny campaign speech . I was always a straight-A student because I worked my ass off . My father told me when I was young that " talent is ninety-nine percent perspiration and one percent inspiration , " and I took it to heart , even though he was plagiarizing Edison . So it was n't easy to be told I had to sit tight . Whenever I got frustrated with my acting career during high school , I would switch my focus to the only other thing I was passionate about : boys . If I did n't get called back for a play , I 'd call up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection would n't sting so hard . I wanted to be able to utilize that technique again , but if you want to meet guys , you have to have a frame , a context , and I did n't have one . College is a frame . My boyfriend at Brown , Will , and I made eyes in Moral Problems class the first week of freshman year and went out for the next year and a half . It does n't work like that in the city , though . If you make eyes at a hot guy on the street , he might follow you home , rape you , hack you to a million pieces , and leave you for the maggots . So instead of trying to meet new guys , I decided to try bluebinning  --  recycling old ones . Whenever I had downtime at work ( which was eighty percent of the time ) , I went through my address book and dialed my exes . I called every cock I 'd caressed in summer camp , Reform Jewish youth group , and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their moms , saying , " Sam 's moved to Austin , " or " You can reach David at his new number in Chelsea , where he 's living with his girlfriend . " My temp job did n't open many romantic doors either . When you 're a temp , nobody talks to you like you 're a permanent resident of the planet . Besides , all the men at McGinley Ladd were rich workaholics , and I knew I could n't have anything real with a guy who could hack the nine-to-five . I kept hoping someone from Brown would invite me to a party , but I did n't make too many fr iends there because I was so tied up in my relationship , so no one was calling . Because I could n't vent my career frustration through real-life nookie , I turned my energies to fantasizing . I stared like a hungry puppy at every male yupster who dropped a paper in the Corposhit 's in box , trying to imagine how big their dicks were , what kind of noises they made when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass men , or pussy men . I concocted elaborate scenarios involving them sitting at important business meetings and me sucking them off under their conference tables while they tried to act normal . At night , after dinner with my family , I would go into my room , get under the covers , and diddle the dai dai . If I could n't sleep , I 'd wank . If I was bored , I 'd wank . ( Once , Zach came in the room and I had to stop abruptly , but the great thing about being a chick is that no one can see your woody through the sheets . ) My orgasms were pleasant enough , but my hand was a poor substitute for a bona fide bone . It was pathetic . I was making my living as a receptionist , the oldest pornographic stereotype in the book , and I did n't have anyone to role-play with . After a month in the most seminal city in the world , I was an overweight actress , an overqualified temp , and an oversexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the train at Borough Hall , I figured out a way to improve at least one aspect of my sorry life . I was leafing through magazines at the newsstand when I spotted a copy of Backstage . I picked it up and flipped to the Casting section . An ad caught my eye immediately : " Lolita : Rock On . A rock musical version of the Nabokov classic , to perform at 24th St. Stag e . Seeking : Lolita , 15-25 , pure but tainted , pristine but vulgar . Some singing required , but soul more important than technique . " I hoped they meant it , because although I can do many things , singing is not one of them . As soon as I got to work , I called the number in the ad . A middle-aged man answered . He had a sleazy , soft-sell voice , the kind you hear on luxury car commercials . " I 'm calling about the audition , " I said . " My name 's Ariel Steiner . " " I 'm Gordon Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come in Saturday at four . " That night at dinner I told my family about the audition . My dad raised his eyebrows a little when I mentioned the word Lolita , then forced a smile and said , " Knock ' em dead . " After dinner I locked myself in the bathroom , ran the tap water , and practiced Gershwin 's " I 've Got a Crush on You " into the mirror until I had more soul than JB . When I was done , I went into my room , opened the closet , and looked for an audition outfit . I picked out a polka-dot midriff for authenticity , because that 's what Lolita is wearing when Humbert first catches sight of her . Then I caught a glimpse of my gut and decided against it . I had to go down four flights of stairs to get to the theater . It was next to a karate center , on the bottom floor of an old church . The waiting room was dark and smelled of cigarettes . Battered copies of Backstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black curtain led to the theater . A blond twelve-year-old and her mother were sitting on one side of the room and a brunette in her thirties was on the other . The girl was very cute , but I could see immediately that she was no nymphet . I did n't know what to make of the brunett e . I figured she was either auditioning for the role of Mrs. Haze or seriously deluded about her age range . After a few minutes the curtain opened and a short , squat man with a white beard came out . I could tell by his voice that it was Gordon . He smiled at the girl and said , " Betsy ? " The mom gave her an eager smile , Betsy went into the theater , and the curtain closed behind her . I heard her say something about " hoping to get involved in off-Broadway theater . " How clueless can she be ? I thought . This show was about as far off Broadway as you could get . You count the offs by the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater . It was quiet for a second , and then Betsy broke into this loud , throaty version of " Hand in My Pocket " by Alanis Morissette . I looked over at Betsy 's mom . She was beaming with pride . I pitied that mom . Did n't she know her kid was never going to get cast with the most brain-numbing anthem in the history of pop as her audition song ? After about fifteen seconds I heard Gordon say , " Thanks so much , Betsy . That 's all we need for today . " Betsy came out of the room looking vacant and dazed , and she and her mom walked out . The brunette got called in next . She sang " On My Own " from Les Misrables in a shaky falsetto and she got stopped after ten seconds . The curtain opened , she left in a huff , and Gordon came out . " You must be Ariel , " he said . " I 'm Gordon Gray . " He extended his hand . " Nice grip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of the handshake . The theater was tiny and dark and it took a second for my eyes to adjust to the light . It looked more like a bomb shelter than a theater . There were audience seats on thre e sides and the stage was just an empty square area of paint-chipped concrete floor . A wiry , fiftyish man in a beard and glasses was sitting in front row center . " This is Gene , " said Gordon . " He 'll be playing Humbert and helping me with the casting . Did you bring a headshot ? " I handed it to him and he sat down next to Gene . They flipped over to the rsum side and glanced at it for a second , nodding like my credits were decent , and then Gordon looked up and said , " Whenever you 're ready . " I took a spot downstage center and breathed in . I tried not to think about Faye or weight or my total lack of vocal training . I was young , I was nubile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to sing : " How glad the many millions of Toms and Dicks and Williams would be to capture me ! But you had such persistence , you wore down my resistance ; I fell and it was swell ... " They were smiling , clearly enjoying it , but I knew I had to do something bigger . On the next line I walked over to Gordon , sat on his lap , wrapped my arms around his neck , and nibbled his ear . He turned bright red and squirmed under me . That squirming was a very good sign . It meant I was affecting him , and if you want to get cast you have to make a bold impression . I would show him I could do this part if it took a lap dance . At the final line I strutted back to the stage , did a few curtsies and twirls , and finished on my knees , with my thumb in my mouth . Gordon whispered to Gene in such an excited way that I was sure I stood a serious chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Would you mind doing an improv ? " I certainly did not mind . Improv has always been one of my strongest skills . Gordon set up two chairs onstage and said , " Here 's the scenario : you 've just finished baby-sitting for Gene 's kids , and now he 's driving you home . " " I do n't remember that scene from the book , " I said . " Oh , that 's not in the book , " Gordon said . " The show is going to be very free-form . We 're envisioning it more as a riff on pedophilia than a literal interpretation of Nabokov . " That was cool . I could riff . Gene and I took our seats . He mimed a steering wheel and said , " So , were my kids good tonight ? " " Oh yes , Mr. Jones , " I answered . " Very good . But I 'm afraid I 'm not such a good girl at all . " I scooted my chair closer to him and put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how much I hated blowing guys my own age and how frustrating it was that none of them knew how to make me come . The raunchier I got , the more flustered I made Gene . I could n't tell how much was real and how much was pretend . Finally I said , " Well , here 's my house , Mr. Jones , " leaned over , and kissed him on the lips good-bye . His breath stank and there was some crust caked on his mouth corners , but I pretended to be into it . Then I pulled away , stood up , mimed slamming the car door shut , turned to Gordon , and smiled triumphantly . " I 'd like to cast you , " he said . I felt like I 'd just won the Olympic gold . I could n't even sing and I 'd gotten booked as the lead in a rock musical . Clearly my charisma had paid off . But then I remembered how scant my competition had been , and my gold morphed into a bronze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , " said Gordon . " Each of the performers will be given a chance to contribute material which relates to the theme of Lolita . It can take any form  --  song , story , sketch , whatever interests you .

I 'm particularly interested in having the performers use personal , autobiographical experiences in the project . So if you have anything you want to contribute , bring it to rehearsal on Monday . " When I got home from the audition the apartment was empty . My parents were at their country house in the Berkshires , and Zach was out with his friends . I went into my room , sat down in front of the computer , and tried to think of incidents from my adolescence that related to the theme of Lolita . Before I knew it my fingers were flying .

It was the first rehearsal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onstage : Gene ; Gordon ; Ted , the guy playing Quilty ; Fran , the woman playing Mrs. Haze ; the Push-Ups , the show 's all-girl band ; and me . James , the assistant director , was running late , Gordon said . I was sweating profusely , but I tried to bite the bullet . " Um , I have two stories , " I said . " The first is called ' Vanya in My Vulva . ' It 's about this forty-one-year-old playwright who fingered me last year at the movie Vanya on 42nd Street . The second is called ' Shooting Wad and Movies . ' That 's about this thirty-six-year-old married actor I hooked up with when I was sixteen , on the set of an NYU film . Which should I start with ? " Nobody said anything . The guys just stared at me with half-open mouths and the Push-Ups rolled their eyes . Finally Gordon cleared his throat and said , " How ' bout ' Vanya in My Vulva ' ? " I took out the story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thirty-five . We were in a theater group together , and at each weekly meeting he would stare at my chest and tell me I was becoming a woman before his very eyes . One night he called me up and said he 'd just written a play about a man who sodomizes and murders a crippled retarded girl he meets in Central Park . He said he wrote the little girl part with me in mind and wanted to know if I would come over to his apartment and read it with him . I said I was n't sure , hung up , went into the living room , and asked my parents what sodomizing was . They would n't tell me . " I never did the reading anyway , because Roberto booked a TV show in L.A. and had to move , and we did n't speak for the next four years . But junior year of college , he called me in my dorm room . He 'd gotten my number from my parents . He started out asking me innocuous questions like how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how big my nipples were , whether my butt shook when I walked , how thick my pubic hair was , and what size bra I wore , cup and number . " Gene coughed . Gordon shifted in his seat . " I loved these questions . Roberto was a freak , but he was a million times more exciting than all the idiot college boys I was dating . He said he 'd be in New York for a few weeks around Christmas , visiting friends , and we arranged to meet at a caf on MacDougal Street . I was pleased to find that his looks had only improved with age . His hair was n't receding , he was tan and buff , he wore a long , gray wool coat and dark , clean jeans , and he kissed me on the mouth hello . We sat in the caf reminiscing and then he suggested we see Vanya on 42nd Street . " In the middle of the movie he started biting my ear and li p . ' Kiss me , Ariel , kiss me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss me . Turn to me and kiss me , baby . Come on , kiss me . ' I did , but Roberto was a biter and biters really turn me off . I kept closing my mouth to hint that I liked to be kissed soft and sweet , instead of hard and rough , but he kept gnawing the tip of my tongue . " Right on the word tongue I saw someone come through the curtain into the theater , and as soon as I saw him a current shot straight from my heart to my hole . He was in his early thirties , medium height , in a hip-length leather jacket , and he had mussed yellow hair and Buddy Holly glasses . His glasses and strut made it clear he thought he was hot shit on a silver platter . It 's always the cockiest guys who nerd themselves down because nerding yourself down is a way of saying , I 'm so hot I can dress like a dork and women will still find me good looking . I was not turned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always been a sucker for guys who think they 're hot shit because I want to be the one woman to turn them into the weak fucks they really are . He took a seat in the front row of the audience , and I struggled for a few seconds to find my place in the story . " Then Roberto put his hand on my leg and up my skirt and rubbed my underpants . He slid his fingers under the panties and stuck one inside . I closed my eyes , and when I opened them I saw Wallace Shawn on the screen , lisping his way through a mournful monologue . I wondered if I was the only one watching Wallace Shawn who had a finger up her crack . " I glanced at Buddy Holly . He was smiling . " When the movie was over we walked down the street holding hands . We headed up Sixth Avenue to Balducci 's and he boug ht me jelly beans and cheese . I liked him buying me things . It did n't matter that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run . It was a warm pleasure to walk down the street on the arm of a man who knew the importance of a nice wool coat , who had good teeth , clear skin , and thick hair . Who smelled like old Aramis , called me ' baby , ' and walked briskly with his arm linked in mine . My life was like a Charlie perfume ad . With a very sick twist . " I looked up . " That 's it . " It was quiet . One of the Push-Ups glared at me and lit a cigarette . Gene and Gordon grinned uncomfortably , and Buddy Holly crossed his legs . " Excellent , Ariel , excellent , " said Gordon . " There 's some real good stuff there . Real good stuff . " " I agree , " said Gene . " You 've got some vivid , potent material there . Your writing is so firm , and stark , and tight . I think she should read the other story , Gordon . What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon . " This is James Delaney , everyone . The assistant director . Ariel 's just finished reading a tantalizing tale about an experience with an older man , James . " " I 'm sorry I came late , " said James . " Have you copyrighted your stories ? " he asked , as I packed them into my bag . It was the end of rehearsal and everyone had left the theater except us . " No , I just wrote them a few nights ago , for the show . Why ? " " You might want to consider it , in case you ever submit them somewhere . There 's a lot of theft in literary magazines these days . You could submit something somewhere , have it rejected by an editorial assistant , then see it pop up under her name in another publication months later . Happens all the time . " " As a matter of fact , I do . Not with me , but at home . " " Maybe you could ... give me your number , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . " As he started to reach for the Pilot V5 Extra Fine pen protruding from his shirt pocket , my sexual frustration balled up into a fist and punched me in the face . I shot my hand out and grabbed the pen myself , letting my fingers rest against his chest for a second as I pulled . I glanced at him quickly to see his reaction . He looked half intrigued , half afraid . Maybe writing those stories had been a wiser move than I knew . That night under the covers , I pretended my vagina was the trash compactor in Star Wars and James was this tiny Han Solo trapped inside me . The hotter I got , the faster my walls began to close and the harder he had to struggle to get out . After a few minutes he found this pole in there and desperately tried to pry me open with it , but it was to no avail . Each move he made only intensified my arousal and crushed him further . I was going to suffocate that little fucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , I imagined myself shooting his miniature carcass out of me across the room . As soon as he landed he began to grow to human size  --  still dressed as Han Solo , except in Buddy Holly glasses . He climbed on top of me , fucked me slowly and expertly , collapsed with a sigh , and hummed " Everyday " softly into my ear until I fell asleep . " Good morning , Ashley Ginsburg 's office , Ariel Steiner speaking . How may I assist you ? " " Mmmm , " he said . " You have such a sexy phone voice . " I loved that compliment . My voice has always been the attribute I 'm most proud of . The only part of my job I enjoyed was answering the phone , since it let me put on a little show for each caller . I always tried to cultivate a pleasant , welcoming , and perfectly well modulated tone . " Yes . But I also ... had another agenda . I wanted to know if you 'd like to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal off . " I wrote " YES ! ! ! ! ! ! " in huge letters on my blotter . " That sounds fine , " I said . " Good . Let 's go to Corner Bar , at West Fourth and West Eleventh . At ten , say . And I want you to bring those stories . " " Why ? " " Because as I watched you read last night , I could see that you possessed something ... something highly alluring . If you got onstage and performed those stories for an audience of men , I am certain that you would electrify . I would just love to ... present you . To be a part of you turning men on . To assist with that task . " He was quiet . All I could hear was his heavy breath . I wondered if he had something in his hand . " What about women , though ? Would women be allowed in the theater ? " &lt; " Yes . The women would be jealous once they saw how the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their men that night harder than ever and the men would make love to them thinking of you . The sex would be so good that the women would feel grateful to you . You have this incredible erotic energy , which should be put onstage for other people to watch . You have something powerful and hot and big . " There was something bizarre about James 's vision , but he thought I was sexy and that flattered me . Besides , maybe he was on to something with this one-woman-show idea . We could tour the globe together and wow crowds from Houston to Hamburg . Critics would dub me the Jewish Madonna , the thinking girl 's Robin Byrd , the straight Holly Hughes . After a few months on the road James would fall in love with my brilliance and propose . I 'd insist that he convert to Judaism , we 'd get hitched in Temple Emanu-El before a crowd of thousands and immediately have a litter of slightly off-balance children . I 'd drop the smut tales and start doing performance art about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocative than before . Everyone who watched me would suddenly want to become parents , and it would set off a worldwide population explosion that would go down in history as the Steiner Effect . " I should go , " said James . " OK , " I said . " I 'm looking forward to tomorrow . I think it will be a highly entertaining evening , for both of us . " " I hope so . " That night at rehearsal , Gene played a composition he 'd written on his French horn , entitled " Lovely Lolita , " and James read a long , rambling poem about a deer hunter . It was boring and pretentious and made me lose some artistic respect for hi m , but it did n't diminish my lust . At the end of the night I waved good-bye to him casually so no one would know there was something budding between us . After work the next day I stopped in the Village to browse for shoes . I was passing by Patricia Field , this transvestite store on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spotted a long , shiny black flip wig with the hair curled up at the ends . I went inside . " Where are the wigs ? " I asked the hulking she-man behind the counter . " Upstairs , " she said in a German accent that sounded fabricated . At the top of the stairs was a counter with a row of wigs behind it . A tall , severe-looking queen was behind it , fitting a girl my age with the very wig I wanted . It did n't look too good on her . She had pale skin and small features and it was too big for her face . I felt sure it would took better on me because I have large features and a large head . The girl shook her head no , the queen took off the wig , and I stepped up to the counter . " Excuse me , " I said . " How much is that one ? " " A hundred , " she said , primping it up . There was no way in hell I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . I knew she would probably hate me for trying on something I was n't planning to buy , but I did n't care . Her job frustration was her problem , not mine . " I 'd like to put it on . " I sat down in the swivel chair behind the counter . She turned me so my back was to the mirror , fitted me with the wig , then spun me around so I could see my reflection . Suddenly I was a raven-haired knockout . My skin looked visibly pinker . Usually it looks green because of my Russian Jewish ancestry . My mother 's always called it olive , but it 's really closer to chartreuse . My eyes lo oked bright and alive and my torso seemed slimmer . " You look like Mary Richards , " said the queen . " Who 's that ? " " Oh , honey . You never saw The Mary Tyler Moore Show ? " " It was kind of before my time , " I said , blushing . " But thanks anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She fluffed the wig and made the ends curl out more dramatically . I ran my fingers through the hair as if it were my own , but the gesture looked distinctly false in the mirror . I tried again , and the second time it looked more natural . I could n't stop looking at the new me . I loved her . I felt gorgeous and available and on top of the world . Then I remembered the price . " You can take it off now , " I said . She sneered , removed the wig , and put it back on the dummy head . I trudged down the stairs without looking back . When I got outside I noticed a bank machine across the street . Suddenly I heard Robin Williams 's voice in my head saying , " Carpe diem . " The only reason I saw Dead Poets Society was for the young hottie quotient , but that line has always rung truer than true . I looked at the display wig in the window , then back across the street at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diem . The queen was visibly delighted when I told her I 'd take it . I knew she 'd probably get a handsome commission . She trimmed the wig a bit , said , " If you tweeze your brows it 'll look even better , " and started to put it in a plastic bag . " No , " I said . " I 'll wear it . " As soon as I got out on the street , I felt like a new woman . Men turned and stared . I did n't know if they were staring because they thought I was hot or because they knew it was a wig , but it did n't really matter . They were looking . When I got home from the store I raced to my room and opened my closet . There was no doubt in my mind that I should wear the wig on the date , because it seemed like just the sort of thing James would enjoy . But I needed a dress to go with it : something saucy yet simultaneously demure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clothes until my eyes fell upon a bright white number . It was the nurse dress I 'd bought junior year for Halloween at the Providence Salvation Army , also known as the fashion locus of the Western world . I had found it in the uniforms section , and when I got back to my dorm I hemmed it to ass length and went to a party . I did n't stop getting compliments the whole night . I felt like a porno movie come to life . And James was a highly pornographic man . After dinner I showered , tweezed my eyebrows , bleached my mustache , and put on some lipstick , the wig , the dress , and my brown platform heels . I slipped on a boiled-wool car coat , put the stories in a fake-alligator-leather lunch-box handbag , and went to the front door . My mom came out of the kitchen . " What did you do to your hair ? " " It 's a wig , " I said . " Leo ! Zach ! You got ta see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , where they 'd been surfing the Net . " Oh , dear God , " said my dad . " It 's not real ! " said my mom . " It 's a wig ! " " You look like one of those Hasidic women , " said Zach . " I 'm trying to look like Mary Richards . " " You do n't look like Mary ! " laughed my dad . " You look more like one of the daughters in Fiddler on the Roof . How ya doing , Chava ? Why are n't your legs covered ? " My mom laughed and so did Zach , and then the three of them broke into the chorus of " Sunrise , Sunset . " " Leave me alone ! " I snapped , went out the door , and slammed it behind me . I felt a little guilty for being such a bitch , but it was such a mood killer to be dressed like a looker and have to deal with a naggy family . When I got out of the subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Spirit cigarettes , the natural , nonadditive kind . I 've always thought their motto should be " They 'll kill you , but slowly . " I do n't really like smoking but I like the way I look smoking . I buy cigarettes whenever I want to feel sexy or jaded , then smoke one or two and throw the rest of the pack out . I lit up , walked to the bar , and cupped my hands against the window to see if I could spot James . He was sitting right by the window , sipping a glass of beer . I pushed the door open and posed in the doorway , the cigarette hand poised against the jamb , the other on my hip . I looked straight at him and said , " I 'm not a smoker , but I play one on TV . " He lifted his head and smiled . So did some of the other patrons . That was a little embarrassing , but I knew I had to own the moment . I approached him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my platform heels , feeling glad I 'd worn control-top panty hose . " That 's a gorgeous wig , " he said . " How 'd you know it was a wig ? " " It 's crooked . I can see your hairline . " I pulled it down . " What would you like to drink ? " I was about to say a Bass , but I thought it might sound unfeminine , so instead I said , " How about a whiskey sour ? " I 'd never had one before but it seemed like just the kind of drink a swinging single woman might order . He beckoned the bartender over . " Another Bass please , and a whiskey sour . " " I do n't have any sour mix , " said the bartend er a bit gruffly , looking at me . " I can give you whiskey , lemon juice , and sugar . " Suddenly I realized my faux pas : a whiskey sour was a bourgeois drink  --  and this was not a bourgeois bar . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back , and all the other patrons were haggard old men . " Just make it two Basses , " I mumbled . The bartender brought the beers and James and I went to a table in the back . " Can I help you with your coat ? " he asked . " Sure . That 's sweet of you . " " It 's not as altruistic as you think , " he said , easing it off my shoulders . " Do you know where the tradition of men helping women with their coats comes from ? " " No . " " From men wanting to rub against women 's rears . It 's a classic masking of an ageless urge . " I waited for him to press himself against me but he just pulled the coat off and sat down across from me . " Did you bring the stories ? " he said . " Yes . " " Why do n't you read me one ? " I reached for my handbag and took out " Shooting Wad and Movies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Why did you move ? " I asked . " Because I want to watch you from the side . That way , when you look at me , you 'll have to peer over your shoulder . I find it very sexy when a woman peers over her shoulder at me . Did you ever notice how women in fashion advertisements are posed that way ? " " No . " " It 's because that 's the mammalian come-hither look , from the days we were four-legged creatures and did it from behind . " James was revealing himself to be severely deranged , but I 'm never intrigued unless the guy 's somewhat deranged . I looked down at the papers . " I first met Mitchell Sorensen on the set of an NYU graduate film we had both been cast in . It was about a young girl 's budding friendship with the school janitor . " As I continued to read , James watched me closely . If I lifted my hand to brush the wig from my face , he stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was getting dry , he stared at my tongue . He watched me like watching me was a cottage industry . When I finished the story , he said , " Now , why do n't you take out the other one ? " " But you heard it at rehearsal , " I said . " Why do you want to hear it again ? " " It 'll help me get performance ideas . " I was in a predicament I could not have anticipated : James was turning out to be more interested in my talent than my talent . Suddenly , someone turned on the jukebox . Loud Sinatra came on . " Let 's go somewhere quieter , " said James . I was relieved . Maybe the change of pace would make him forget about the stories . We went to a Greek diner and sat down in a booth , side by side . When the waiter came I ordered a coffee and James ordered a grapefruit . That made me slightly uncomfortable . I 'd never met a man who ordered grapefruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Please read . " " I do n't want to anymore , " I said . " I think you should . " " Why ? " " It 's good for you . " " No , it 's not . I know what 's good for me and I can tell you that 's not it . What would be good would be if you took me home with you . " " But you have so much tension inside you right now . That tense energy is exactly what I want to put onstage . It 's what makes you so sexy  --  that desire , that fervor . I want you to play with what it feels like not to have any release . " " I want release ! " He spooned out another wedge , chewed it slowly , sighed , and said , " All right . Let me help you with your coat . " He had his own place on Christopher , with a loft bed . There was a brown leather couch , a TV across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the window . To the left of the front door was a kitchen with a butcher-block island . " What do you do for a living ? " I asked . " I 'm a carpenter . " Boy oh boy . He worked with his hands . I wanted to jump him , but I had to play it cool . He went into the kitchen , poured himself some whiskey , and offered me a glass . I took a sip . It burned my throat but I tried not to wince . He sat on the couch . I put down the drink and started to climb up the ladder to the bed , hoping he would follow . But he tugged on my leg and said sternly , " You ca n't go up there . It 's private . " I wished he 'd put it more politely , but politeness is so overrated . I sat down next to him and leaned in to kiss him . He kissed back a little , but his tongue was fat and lazy and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled away , stood up , and crossed over to the armchair . " What are you doing ? " I asked . " My primary interest is in watching men watch you . That 's why I wanted to meet you in a bar . Did you notice how all the men looked at you when you took off your coat ? " " Sort of . " " That 's because you have something very special . You exude sex . And men can smell that . You will walk down the streets and they will sniff it in you . You should stare into the eyes of men on the streets and enjoy how much they will want you . " I wanted to believe I had that much power . I wanted to believe I was the kind of girl who made men crazy , even if I was too fat to be an ingenue , even if this was my first date since I 'd come to the city . He kept talking , and I stuck my hand down my stockings . Between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only took me about ten minutes . " I came , " I said after . ( I do n't make any loud noises . I never do . ) " I 'm glad , " he said . I thought about leaving but I did n't feel ready . I wanted to arouse him , and since he would n't let me touch him , I decided to try another way . I stood up by the couch and slowly unzipped the front of my nurse dress . I slid it off my shoulders and threw it on the floor , till I was standing in front of him in just my panty hose and Minimizer bra . I unsnapped my bra slowly , dropped it on the floor too , and ran my fingers up and down my breasts , like a stripper in a movie . He opened his mouth and watched me , and then he unzipped his pants , took it out , and began to stroke it . I kept moving around , pretending " Fever " was playing in the background , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flip the wig like it was real . His blinds were up and it was dark outside , so I could see my reflection in the window . In that black wig , with my bra off , in my stockings and platform heels , I was a glam queen . I was beautiful . After several minutes he leaned his head back hard and fast against the chair with a thump and shot it out all over his hand and pants . I went to the bathroom and got a Kleenex . As I handed it to him he looked
