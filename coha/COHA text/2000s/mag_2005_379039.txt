Peter O'Toole has faced down some acting challenges in his day . ( Lawrence of Arabia springs to mind . ) But the movie he is making now is particularly treacherous . " What 's the old clich ? " he asks . " Do n't act with children and dogs ? Well , try children , dogs , horses and hounds , coal miners , a motor car formerly the property of the late George Raft , and a fox . Try acting with that lot , which I did the other day . Verrrrry tricky . " O'Toole , 72 , knew when he signed up for the remake of Lassie that there would be a collie , a massive hunt scene in which his character would chase a fox down a coal mine in an old Duesenberg and two 9-year-old co-stars . " I 'm not complaining , " he says , sitting in his trailer and munching on licorice jujubes , " just amazed . Strange old business , film is . Strange old business . " <P> That anyone would decide to remake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties have been rehashed , and at least director Charles Sturridge ( Brideshead Revisited , Shackleton ) will be classing up the old dog a bit , not only by casting O'Toole , Samantha Morton and Peter Dinklage in major roles but also by taking the story back to its pre  --  **25;18410;TOOLONG roots . " I never saw the TV show , and I ca n't recall any of the films , " says Sturridge , who hopes to have his movie ready for a Christmas release . " But the original novel "  --  Lassie Come-Home , written by Eric Knight in 1940  --  " was set in Yorkshire , and it had a certain prewar British integrity about it . In current children 's films , you have to be ironic to reach the parents in the audience . It 's a profitable formula , but this film wo n't appeal to one audience over the heads of another . It looks the whole audience in the eye . " <P> The production itself is a little less straightforward . For tax reasons , the Isle of Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear only to Classic Media , holder of the rights to Lassie , everyone on the set is required to stick to the fiction that Lassie is being played by a single dog named Lassie . Actually , three collies named Carter , Mason and Dakota share the part . " We have the stunt dog , the running dog and the picture dog , " trainer Mathilde de Cagny whispers . " We do a little bit of makeup on the picture dog to darken him up . He 's lighter than the others , so we had a special dog colorist from Los Angeles come in . She has vegetable dyes that do the trick . " No makeup can disguise the fact that all three Lassies are male . " We count on the fur to hide that , " says de Cagny . A strange business indeed .
