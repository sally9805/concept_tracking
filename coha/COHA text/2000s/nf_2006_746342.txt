In 1973 Wilbur Zelinsky lamented and documented the low representation of women in American academic geography . His attention reflected the climate of the times  --  the challenges of the women 's movement , affirmative action , and feminist activism in the professions . Drawing on archives and personal narratives , this article addresses the paradoxes and politics of women 's place in American academic geography in the 1970s . As increasing numbers developed new aspirations for graduate education and professional work , stereotyping , discrimination , the lack of mentoring , and the challenges of a job market whose peak had passed presented difficulties . Yet persistence , resistance , and feminist political activism worked to advance women 's professional standing and visibility , especially at the national level within the Association of American Geographers and in the development of new research and teaching on the geography of women . <p> Keywords : academic politics ; employment in geography ; geographical education ; women geographers <p> In 1973 , during his presidency of the Association of American Geographers ( AAG ) , Wilbur Zelinsky broke new ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic geography . In " The Strange Case of the Missing Female Geographer , " his views-and-opinions article in the Professional Geographer , he opened with " I bear evil tidings. : the lot of the female geographer is , and has been , a discouraging one , and there is little assurance of substantial improvement during the foreseeable future " ( 1973a , 101 ) . His companion article , " Women in Geography : A Brief Factual Account " ( 1973b ) , analyzed the AAG 's membership and the composition of faculties in U.S. and Canadian departments of geography . He reported that women accounted for only 12.3 percent of more than 6,000 AAG members and 6.3 percent of more than 2,000 members holding college faculty appointments . He wrote with " a sense of outrage that is difficult to control , and strong dismay over the wastage of the great quantity of unused and underdeveloped talent so sorely needed by the world of learning and by society as a whole " ( 1973a , 102 ) . His articles reflect the tenor of the times  --  women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from courts and governments , and modest efforts in the AAG represented by the appointment of a Committee on the Status of Women in Geography ( CSWG ) in 1971 in response to activism by women members and their supporters . <p> A decade later Zelinsky returned to the situation of women in geography , this time including not only a discussion of status but also an extensive review of geographical research in the emerging field of feminist geography that he agreed to coauthor with two then-junior women geographers , thereby enhancing their visibility ( Zelinsky , Monk , and Hanson 1982 ) . Since those articles , numerous scholars have assessed the situation of women in geography in a variety of national , institutional , and subdisciplinary contexts , expressing concern about limited progress and discrimination. ( n1 ) <p> My purpose is not to update such research . Rather , I am interested in the gendered cultures and politics of changes in the profession in the United States in the 1970s , the period bounded by Zelinsky 's articles on the status of women and on a new field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marked transitions in the makeup of the profession , transitions that had implications for the creation of geographical knowledge . I explore the shaping of careers and look at the ways in which activist networks within the AAG endeavored to instigate change . My interpretations are framed by the evolving approaches of feminist geography . I incorporate the goals of early work to give visibility and voices to women , to recognize gender as a social and cultural phenomenon , and to explore inequalities and power relations . I am attuned to more recent work concerned with differences among women  --  by class , ethnicity , age , and marital status , for example  --  with subjectivity , and with the interplay of individual actions and larger social structures. ( n2 ) I aim to be sensitive to the diversity of contexts . My interpretations also reflect the literature on women academics in other disciplines , especially history and sociology , in which scholars have addressed the transitions of the era ( Meadow-Orlans and Wallace 1994 ; Laslett and Thorne 1997 ; Boris and Chaudhuri 1999 ) . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and personal narratives that show how individuals change and are changed by the contexts in which they live and work , accepting and challenging norms ( Personal Narratives Group 1989 ) . Since 1988 I have conducted extended interviews with more than sixty women geographers who were in graduate school sometime between the 1930s and 1980s . Most of the interviews took place by 1995 , supplemented by follow-up communications and some additional interviews . The narratives reflect generation , the time at which they were told , and the extent to which we were personally acquainted . Some were women with sustained careers in academic geography ; some had anticipated academic appointments but were unable to attain or sustain them for various reasons ( familial constraints , exigencies of the labor market , or negative decisions within departments ) . Others chose arenas beyond the academy , in government or the private sector . My own situation represents some of the complexities of women 's professional situations in the late twentieth century . I was a graduate student in the 1960s , attained a tenure-track faculty position in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national councillor of the AAG from 1978 to 1981 , thus acquiring firsthand experience in organizational activities. ( n3 ) By the time of the interviews ; having been denied tenure in 1980 , I worked in an interdisciplinary institute for research on women but maintained my ties with geography . For this article I draw on thirty of the interviews in my collection , selecting women who earned doctorates and/or began as faculty members in the 1970s . They had studied in fifteen different doctoral programs and worked in an array of institutions . Six reflections relate to one doctoral program , five programs are represented by two or three women each , and nine others by single cases . <p> I committed to maintaining confidentiality for the interviewees , important in a relatively small profession in which many of the women continue to work . This commitment has consequences for elaborating on local contexts , a challenge compounded by the varying number of women with experience in specific departments , by work with different faculty members within them , and by differences in dates within the decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's limited career expectations as they were growing up and the varieties and ambiguities of their experiences with fellow graduate students and professors . Also critical are the developing political awareness and activism that led to the creation of new scholarship on women and efforts to gain voice and status in the profession . EARLY EXPECTATIONS <p> The context of the late 1960s and early 1970s was marked by social ferment and change in American society and higher education , impacted by the civil rights and women 's liberation movements , protests against the Vietnam War , and the presence of the " baby-boom " generation in college . Passage of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the Education Amendments Act in 1972 , which increased scrutiny of institutions of higher education , seemed to offer prospects for addressing male dominance in academia. ( n4 ) The times appeared ripe for women to have rising expectations for academic careers . But counterforces were at play , especially the serious contractions in the academic labor market and the decreasing support for graduate education with the discontinuation in 1973 of National Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rossiter 1995 ) . Perhaps , not surprisingly , as Zelinsky was writing about the missing women , the most dramatic change in student membership within the AAG was actually the massive disappearance of men students . While the number of women student members increased from 346 in 1972 to 459 in 1980 ( AAG 1973-1981 ) , male student membership fell precipitously , from 1,897 to 879 . Thus women 's relative presence more than doubled among student members , from 15 percent in 1973 to 34 percent in 1980 . The absolute number of women earning doctorates in geography also rose substantially over the decade , from 42 in the 1960s to 193 in the 1970s ( AAG 2004b ) . What motivations and experiences underlie these numbers ? Were women inspired by visions of new careers ? How did they experience this milieu ? <p> The motives expressed for pursuing graduate education were largely unmarked by feminist rhetoric that might have been stimulated by the women 's movement ; rather , they reflected the gendered expectations of the 1950s and early 1960s , when most of the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents were daughters of professional men , but most described themselves as of lower-middle- or working-class origins , often with parents who were not college educated . Most grew up in small towns , suburbs , or rural communities ; a few were foreign born or " racial " /ethnic minority women . Strikingly , for the period , the mothers of a substantial number of these geographers had been employed at some point during their daughters ' childhood , most often in traditionally female jobs as teachers , clerical workers , or social workers . The daughters expected that they too would be employed , but they almost always anticipated that this would be combined with marriage and family , as teachers in elementary or secondary schools . " My mother had told me teaching was a nice career for a woman , because you have summers off , " said one. ( n5 ) Another reported , " In those days , coming out of the kind of town I did , and having the friends I did , it was a job you had to go to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for something you could slip in and out of , and have a family at the same time . Just all those horrible things we used to say . " <p> Goals at the beginning of their higher education and academic careers were often vague . " I started with a view , which I generally follow , that I 'll see what happens . I was relatively young , and I did n't have any commitments really , so I figured , I 'd see what would happen . " Yet they were also aware of not conforming : " I did n't make a sharp decision , but at least I allowed myself to get caught up in a route that was different from everyone I had known . " Escape from negative situations prompted some . A young mother in a bad marriage commented , " I remember telling people I was just going to college in case something happened to my husband . But I must have known deep down that I wanted to work , or I would n't have been going to all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in college . " Another , finding her work unsatisfying , returned to complete her bachelor 's and master 's degrees in her late twenties ; after brief employment in a technical position , she entered a doctoral program in search of more autonomy . <p> Only a few had early expectations of nontraditional careers : Two had wanted to go into medicine , for example , but were deflected by family warnings or by the realization that they lacked the necessary preparation in the sciences . One who came from a home where " science mattered " commented , " I think we were just encouraged to pursue our interests , and there was never the assumption that we would n't need to work or would n't need to be our own people . " The youngest of the women I interviewed , from a professional family , expressed the most direct expectations of an academic career . More commonly , the narratives presented ambiguities and gradually changing motivations : " I more or less did what my parents and my husband told me to do . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my future to be " one reported . Later she indicated , " I had very clear career goals . I did want to get that PhD . Being a teacher was what I wanted to do . " She deferred having children until she had earned her doctorate . <p> If graduate education was not clearly anticipated , memories of childhood often revealed interests in geography . One recalled " sitting and looking at the globe spinning around and taking hypothetical journeys . I must have been in third or fourth grade . " Another " used to sit with an atlas and take imaginary trips . " A woman who left her home country commented , " I was n't satisfied with what life was going to be . . I could have gone the way of all flesh . but I knew there had to be more to life than that .. And I do n't think I 'm trying to prove anything to anyone else . All along the way , I was looking for something that filled me up inside . " <p> For some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences were influential in prompting changes in aspirations and directions . Shaped by the era , some joined the Peace Corps , holding assignments in Africa , Asia , or Latin America . One such woman , in her early twenties , spent long periods as the only outsider in a remote community , thriving despite isolation . Field experiences and travel inspired others . A young mother in graduate school left a " how-to-survive book " for her husband and children in order to conduct research in a part of the world recently opened to outsiders . One island hopped in a small sailing boat , with her husband and young child , to conduct research . Another was inspired by travel to remote regions of the Amazon with her graduate-student husband to work on a professor 's mapping project . WELCOME TO GRADUATE SCHOOL <p> When Zelinsky published his status report ( 1973b ) , women accounted for only 3-4 percent of the faculty in 114 U.S. and Canadian graduate geography departments , with no women in 77 of them . The twenty-one doctoral departments that were " widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members ( 1.6 percent ) , one of them holding a visiting appointment ( Zelinsky 1973b ) . An analysis of the Guide to Graduate Departments of Geography in the United States and Canada , 1971-72 , carried out by the newly formed CSWG , identified Barbara Zakrewska , of the University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , as the only woman with full-professor rank in a doctoral department ( AAG  --  CSWG 1972 ) . Role models for women graduate students were certainly scarce . That this situation might have personal implications did not appear to inhibit women from pursuing graduate work . Two surveys identified difficulties in obtaining financial aid as the most important deterrent ( Berman 1977 ; Jones 1987 ) . Department chairmen were frequently quoted as questioning women 's seriousness , stating that " a man needs it more , " even though men students often benefited from the income of employed wives . In the interviews , some women said relatively little about problems , others elaborate on difficulties . Yet , even in departments described as difficult , women found some supportive men faculty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in individual perceptions , have to be recognized , but it is clear , especially from the narratives of multiple graduates of a single department , that what one specialized in and whom one chose as an adviser made a difference . <p> Faculty reported as supportive shared certain traits . Some women thought that fathers of adult daughters identified their women graduate students from that perspective . Comments such as the following recurred : " I was a good student , his wife was employed , he had adult daughters . I think that 's terribly important , it made him recognize that women are people too . " Being " businesslike , " professional , and not recognizing gender differences in their dealings with students was another valued trait : " He talked in a very matter-of-fact way about what we were doing . And did n't really encourage me , but seemed to assume I could do whatever I wanted to do . " Another faculty member was described as " an exception . An intellectual , engaged with politics . , his wife in graduate school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she did her PhD work . He would have a few students to the house to talk geography and research . " <p> Neither the interviews nor other sources ( Berman 1977 ; Rubin 1979 ; Jones 1987 ) suggest that departments sought or welcomed women graduate students in response to equity and affirmative-action rhetoric and politics of the period . My own experience of being appointed to every search committee in my department in the 1970s as the " affirmative-action " representative but not being similarly involved in graduate admissions suggests that equity issues were more salient in discussions about hiring faculty than about recruiting students . It is possible that , because fewer men students were enrolling in graduate school , women applicants were seen in a more favorable light . On this point , I can only speculate . <p> Clearly , women graduate students often experienced difficulties in their departments . As one noted , " Quite a few who came dropped out . It 's amazing that we put up with what we did . There was no formal mechanism for objecting to what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from field courses was one form of active discrimination . Some resented this and protested . Others took the pragmatic view and turned it to their advantage : " I played the fragile flower and stayed home and wrote my thesis .. I just sort of accepted it as that 's the way things are . " <p> Married women represented a new category of graduate students , earlier women usually having been single . Faculty often did not know how to deal with them , especially if they had children . As Susan Hanson ( 2005 ) writes : <p> I was made acutely aware , however , of my unusual status as a woman  --  married woman and a mother at that  --  when on my first day . I met with my assigned academic adviser .. He asked me , out of genuine curiosity , why I wanted to be in graduate school when I was already married and had a child ( i.e. , I had already achieved the chief prevailing goals of womanhood , so what was I doing taking up space in a graduate program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were uneven : <p> Many times I was treated very well . And sometimes I felt like I was not .. There was a time when I almost changed chairman , because I was really very upset . He and his graduate students went on a weekend retreat , and they were all guys except me and I was not invited . And his rationale at the time was that I had not advanced to candidacy and they had .. They felt , I think , that it was awkward to have me along and that they wanted to have a male bonding . They wanted to drink and run around in their undies or something . I do n't know what . But it was done as an academic retreat , not as a social outing and I was very hurt by that , and felt very much excluded . <p> Another switched advisers after she heard that her original adviser had been saying " bad things " about her after her marriage and that she was likely to lose her funding . The new adviser was very supportive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students of her era in that department . <p> Tensions arose not only with faculty but with fellow graduate students , influenced by the tightening job market , competition for student support , resentment of affirmative-action policies , and cultural expectations . One woman thought she was resented because she had both a prestigious fellowship and a job . Another was angry at being labeled the " housewife geographer , " implying that she was not serious and did not merit funding . As they reflected back , women saw how day-to-day practices marginalized them : " The Aussies and Kiwis in my class treated us to rowdy , off-color drinking songs . The living room of the off-campus house used for graduate student offices was set aside as an indoor basketball court . The women in the department were told we were unwelcome there ; our presence would undermine the male esprit de corps " ( Gober 2005 ) . Nevertheless , many enjoyed the camaraderie of fellow graduate students and valued both the social life and intellectual support of male students and the friendship of their wives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informative and stimulating , and I learned from my fellow graduate students many of the things nowadays associated with mentoring " ( Olson 2005 ) . <p> Some had support from the insights and encouragement of their husbands . A survey of women geographers noted that of those who remained married , three-quarters stated that marriage was a positive factor in their pursuit of a graduate degree , with the spouse providing advice and emotional support ( Jones 1987 ) . " How did I end up in a PhD program ? . Perry the pragmatist suggested that on the application form I should check off ' PhD ' rather than Masters sic as the degree desired so that I 'd be more likely to be offered an assistantship . So I did . And I was " ( Hanson 2005 ) . Some had peers on whom they could rely : " Ginny showed me the ropes , introduced me to faculty and students , and was a good mentor .. Her generous spirit taught me the value of friendship and the solidarity of women friends in the very male-dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gober 2005 ) . Juanita Gaston , who participated in the AAG 's Commission on Geography and Afro-America ( COMGA ) program , found her peer group of black students provided significant support . The department had recruited more than one COMGA fellow . Together with the black students in her dormitory , they formed a study group that she found valuable as she made the transition into geography and from an historically black college in the South to a large state institution in the Midwest ( George and Monk 2004 ) . <p> Isolation , in contrast , could be a major source of stress . One suffered extreme depression in a program with about seventy men students where the only other woman , an older teacher , was not taken seriously . Twenty-two years old and having returned from the Peace Corps and world travels , she found little in common with her fellow students and considered the political climate distasteful . " Most male students ostracized me . " During a lonely summer working on her master 's thesis , <p> I was pretty close to killing myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was crying for hours before I went to sleep and then waking up in the middle of the night crying , just totally isolated . and no one cared .. Finally , I said to myself . " you can kill yourself or you can get the hell out of here now ! " I got up at 2 in the morning and wrote out my application to another institution and went out to the mailbox and mailed it . <p> For the most part , as these examples suggest , when difficulties were recognized , coping strategies remained at the individual level : Ignore the situation , turn it to your own advantage , rely on peer support , or leave . In one case , in which a considerable number of women students were in one department , they became very organized , angered by the treatment they saw temporary women faculty receiving and recognizing that individual women students were having problems and needed support . <p> There were some outrageous things that went on , but it was always at the individual level , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working together .. One of the things that came out was that we do n't have any mentors in the department , so we 're gon na have to mentor each other . Several meetings were devoted to , OK , when you go to an AAG meeting , what do you wear , how do you act ? . I remember , somebody read Dress for Success , and then summarized it to the rest of us , which in retrospect seems kind of ridiculous , but it was the kind . of stuff we needed to know . <p> Reflecting both their group solidarity and growing feminist consciousness , this group of women became weary of the department 's repeated hiring of men , especially at a time when there were multiple positions . <p> And the graduate students were just really getting mad , because whenever you tried to discuss a female candidate , it was like nobody wanted to say anything .. They would n't say anything against her , but they would n't say anything for her either . Or if somebody said anything for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare at them . It was obvious that things had been decided before they showed up at faculty meetings .. There was the revolving door position that they kept putting women in . So the students got real radical . We wrote letters to the president of the AAG and the chair of the Committee on the Status of Women in Geography .. We wanted the Association to be on the alert of unfair hiring practices . Well boy , were they mad at us for doing this . You know , we should n't have aired the dirty laundry in public . <p> No simple explanation exists for the differences in departmental climates , a subject that also remains to be explored in contemporary academia . When women students of the 1970s spoke of how they chose graduate programs they did not discuss whether a department was perceived as hospitable for women . For married women especially , or those supporting families , the choice often reflected convenience of location . For others , undergraduate teachers served as guides ( Gober 2005 ) . Some were in departments of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be either supportive or extremely hostile , depending on the mix of faculty . One woman , initially denied admission to the nearest institution , which did not have a stellar reputation , was subsequently failed by one point on the qualifying examinations . She was told in no uncertain terms that " We have never given a PhD to a woman in this department and we never will .. They kicked every bit of self-esteem out of me . " Her psychic support came from women outside the university and eventually from the coaching of the first woman faculty member to join the department . <p> Others chose departments in which ambitious faculty were building their reputations . That context seems to have contributed to a mind-set of graduate school as " boot camp . " Such settings have been criticized for the ways in which they damaged students ' self-confidence and productivity , sometimes with lasting effects . " No matter what we did , it was n't good enough .. You creep out of there thinking , ' Oh my God , I 'm a total failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significance of a critical mass of women students as precondition for overt resistance . ENTERING THE JOB MARKET <p> By the early 1970s the booming academic job market of the 1960s was over . In 1972 the AAG Newsletter reprinted an article entitled " PhD Surplus Looms , " indicating that the National Science Foundation was predicting a 20 percent surplus of doctorates in the social sciences by 1980 ( Pontius 1973 ) . But another important change was the inauguration , in 1971 , of the " Jobs in Geography " section of the AAG Newsletter ( de Blij 1978 ) , replacing the earlier practice of sending notices to doctoral departments or relying on the " old-boys ' " network to identify candidates . Thus women had more access to information , but in a shrinking labor market . The one-year appointment and the " gypsy scholar " were prevalent , even among the highly qualified women . Perhaps the most extreme case was that of Jacqueline Desbarats . She appears in AAG meeting programs from 1973 to 1980 holding positions in at least four U.S. institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet she maintained an active record of research and publication throughout . <p> Despite the introduction of affirmative action , only about one-third of the thirty women respondents initially secured tenure-track positions , and only two of them mentioned an institution 's interest in appointing women and minorities as relevant to their hiring . Barbara Rubin ( 1979 ) argued that departments were more willing to train than to hire women , reporting a ratio 4:1 of degree completion to hiring of females . Unlike earlier generations of women geographers , who were largely excluded from university positions and almost exclusively made their careers in teachers ' colleges , government , or alternative institutions such as the American Geographical Society ( Monk 2003 , 2004 ) , some women in the 1970s did secure appointments , even if temporary ones , in doctorate-granting departments . Also unlike their predecessors , some went through graduate school on the " fast track " with financial support throughout , so that they were quite young when they went on the job market . One was only twenty-four at the time of earning her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-year research position she felt more assured and then attained a tenure-track assistant professorship . Another commented that her rapid graduate education had not included any experience in teaching and that " I basically had no idea on the mechanics of teaching . I still feel bad for those students in my first couple of courses , who suffered more than I did as I learned my craft " ( Cutter 2005 ) . <p> Although they had moved on from their childhood expectations to aspire to academic careers , the tight market presented serious obstacles . The situation of women whose husbands were also seeking academic positions was especially problematic . Although nepotism policies impinged on hiring in many institutions , not being declared unconstitutional until 1979 ( Jones 1987 ) , lack of mentoring and the values of advisers and people in hiring departments were mentioned as salient barriers . Several women described themselves as " naive , " with graduate faculty not having advised them of what they might expect or how to go about identifying and selecting among any opportunities . " I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like these guys need some guidance . And I think faculty members recognized that this job market was incredibly tight , and that we were not going to get two jobs in the same place , and that I should not be getting pregnant . " She obtained a temporary two-year offer in a large graduate department ( at what she later recognized as " an offensively low salary " that she did not attempt to negotiate ) with no opportunities for her husband . <p> Some couples sought shared positions , and a few were successful ( Kay 1982 ) , but issues of benefits and tenure conditions presented problems . One couple who accepted a joint position was informed that the pretenure period would be doubled for each , while they would still be expected to publish as if full time . They retreated to a full-time position for the husband and an adjunct line for her . Then she faced a period without a job , which was " really tough in terms of self-identity . " <p> Advisers who had been supportive of married women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down : " He always took time to write letters but one that I saw I was rather upset about . He seemed to fill it mostly with how I 'd raised these children . but then he did n't say anything about my academic , scholarly things . " For some , the situation strained marriages , with the husband 's vision of his career and his willingness to be flexible being key to the women 's experiences ( Monk 2001 ) . <p> Not surprisingly , temporary jobs had multiple stresses : being ignored by other faculty , often having heavy teaching loads , and having to cope with insecurities about continuation . Tenure-track jobs predictably had stresses , but women in them , usually the only one on their faculty , faced lack of social rapport and support ( Gober 2005 ) , exacerbated for those who were unmarried . Those who had experienced camaraderie in graduate school felt the change acutely . One noted that she formed some female friendships with administrative and secretarial staff but felt no support from the faculty : " I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If somebody would please tell me what the rules are , I would choose whether to play or not to play . " <p> Experiences at this point in the career have been noted as prompting or heightening feminist consciousness or resistance ( Cutter 2005 ; Olson 2005 ) . Women 's networks across disciplines on campus and within the AAG offered some community , but there was still caution about " making waves " ( Berman 1977 ) . Although filing complaints under federal law had become possible and publicized in geography ( Rubin 1979 ) , few took up this protracted and potentially damaging process . A study conducted by the CSWG in 1972 identified legal actions by women geographers in three reporting departments and knowledge of two other cases from nonreporting departments ( AAG  --  CSWG 1972 ) . I know of only two successful cases involving geographers : rulings and an eventual settlement in favor of Carolyn Weiss , a staff assistant in cartography at Southern Illinois University , Carbondale ( de Fiebre 1976 ; Suhadolnik 1979 ) and a class-action salary-adjustment case at Salem State College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Berman 1989 ) . <p> Despite their early perseverance , some women did not survive the temporary treadmill or the tenure quest . It is difficult to trace subsequent career histories , and this cohort includes many " missing female geographers " My search for names of those who were very active nationally in the 1970s but are no longer traceable in geography indicates that some have found positions of considerable responsibility outside the discipline . Others hung on in part-time adjunct roles or moved in and out of public- and private-sector employment . Although some women have not followed the paths for which they prepared , it is evident that many of this generation have successfully advanced within academic geography and related arenas . Often they have worked to change their professions and society . TAKING ON THE ESTABLISHMENT <p> If activism , changes in the gender composition of faculty , and improved power relationships were modest in individual departments of geography in the 1970s , changes within the AAG were notable , instigated primarily by the increasing numbers of women geographers , especially by some young women geographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other disciplinary organizations of the period and included some networking across disciplinary boundaries ( Meadow-Orlans and Wallace 1994 ; Laslett and Thorne 1997 ; Boris and Chaudhuri 1999 ; Rengert 2005 ) . Transformations of the annual meetings , efforts of the CSWG , and related changes in the leadership , particularly in the AAG Council , reflected this activism . <p> Only eight women were listed in the 1973 Annual Meeting program  --  four offering papers , one as discussant , and three chairing sessions ( AAG 1973 ) . One faculty woman , Judy Olson , was on the Program Committee , and two wives of geographers , Ruth Shear and Jolayne Bederman , were on the Local Arrangements Committee . The meeting included an " AAG Wives Get Acquainted Coffee " and a field trip for ladies , " Atlanta in Dogwood Season . " Women 's participation in meetings increased slowly at first , but by 1979 in Philadelphia , the program 's index included 166 names of women , 21 sessions chaired by women , 3 women faculty on the Local Arrangements Committee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These changes were not simply a matter of demographics . My files contain copies of letters urging the appointment of women to Program Committees and as session chairs , including one exchange between Wilbur Zelinsky and me . In 1978 , when he was on the Program Committee for the upcoming annual meeting , I wrote to him that " I thought you might like to further your pursuit of ' The Strange Case of the Missing Female Geographer , ' " and sent him statistics on the paucity of women chairing sessions at recent annual meetings , noted that this task offered professional visibility , and enclosed a list of women , including their specialties , who might be invited ( Monk 1978 ) . His response : " Touch . Somehow I had failed to notice the decided  --  and , let us charitably assume , unconscious  --  sex bias .. Your message was most opportune . I have just this instant forwarded to the Committee some 27 nominations of possible chairpersons for the Philadelphia conclave . Twelve are women .. I am grateful for your suggestions . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect some changes for the better " ( Zelinsky 1978 ) . <p> Zelinsky 's Pennsylvania State letterhead bore the notation " An Equal Opportunity Employer . " But women were not leaving change up to institutions . The CSWG initiated and regularly organized numerous professional development sessions on such topics as job opportunities , criteria for professional success , parliamentary procedures , and securing funding for research , training , and educational projects . By 1975 , a significant innovation occurred with the introduction of sessions featuring research on women , although an organizer of these early sessions has reported ( impolite ) criticism from a former ( male ) professor for such activity , while also being subjected to feminist criticism for setting up a formal session rather than " sitting in a circle as equals . " Both comments made her feel insecure ( confidential e-mail to the author , 26 February 2005 ) but did not deter her continuing efforts . <p> When the AAG introduced the specialty-group structure in 1979 , the Geographic Perspectives on Women Group organized . The subsequent flowering of feminist geography in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is beyond the scope of this article to address those developments , which have been regularly reviewed elsewhere ( for example , reports in Progress in Human Geography and extensive surveys in Nelson and Seager 2005 ) ; they were first chronicled in the extended article by Zelinsky , Monk , and Hanson 1982 ) . The emergence of such scholarship demonstrates how the production of knowledge reflects the social and political makeup of a profession . <p> Although , to an extent , the expansion of women 's participation in national meetings reflected the growing number of women entering graduate school , it substantially exceeded the growth rate of women 's membership . The policy change in the organization of meetings promoted more open and larger meetings . Until 1973 , papers were refereed by the Program Committee , but in 1974 the AAG introduced open meetings ( de Blij 1978 ) . The number of concurrent sessions soon rose from six to more than twenty , and feminist sessions multiplied , including sessions with papers by graduate students . One issue , especially for those engaging in feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's session " or to spread such work across the program . The consensus in 1975 was that separate sessions served a consciousness-raising function . By 1979 , however , sufficient women were presenting papers in diverse subfields and in regular sessions that Susan Cutter and Hilary Renwick ( 1980 ) were led to write an article on " The Myth of the Women 's Session . " By then the possibilities were considered as both/and rather than either/or . <p> The CSWG served as the focus for political activity and the rallying point to engage in collective endeavors that were not possible in separate departments . Initiated " more by fluke than design , " according to one of its initial members ( Haring 1972 ) , the committee proposed an ambitious eighteen-point action program ( AAG  --  CSWG 1971 ) , including such items as a newsletter , a job roster , a poll of women geographers ' opinions , a referral service to departments , and an inventory of women geographers in government and business . Committee Chair Ann Larimore ( 1972 ) suggested that the initial charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status of women in the American geographic profession , " should be " low priority . ; it seems to me to be evident to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear with . " She also noted that , " officially , we have no budget so we need to maximize our use of scarce ( ha ! non-existent ) resources . " Responding , graduate student member Kirsten Haring ( 1972 ) indicated , " I agree that we should not flounder in data gathering " but that alternative suggestions depended on information . In fact , a survey of chairs of graduate departments became a major early undertaking after $1,800 in support had been obtained from the AAG Council . Although some summary results were reported , Larimore ( 1974 ) recalls that the CSWG had " no thorough discussion about how results were to be disseminated " and somewhat naively expected that " when the leaders of the discipline understood the situation from our survey . they would move to treat women equitably . " <p> More overtly political rhetoric emerged quite soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major goal as to " also bring women 's political and social power in the geography profession up to that exerted by men . Organizational effort and plans for securing that power are what the Committee is all about . " A high priority was to nominate and elect women to office in the AAG . With Bonnie Loyd and Arlene Rengert as prime instigators , petitions were submitted to the Nominating Committee in 1975 proposing Risa Palm as a candidate for national councillor . The effort was not successful , but the CSWG activists demonstrated new political awareness and tactics . <p> The nominating committee.chose to ignore about 20 letters in support of Risa Palm for councillor , so we have gone ahead to use the petition procedure . Arlene Rengert and I have collected the 25 signatures needed and more are still pouring in . Hooray ! Risa 's name will appear on the ballot . <p> Our experience has made us realize that the nominating committee lies at the heart of the problem . Their suggestions for candidates will appear in the next A.A.G. Newsletter .. Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or political viewpoint of the candidates . I propose to collect 10 signatures to place Arlene Rengert on the ballot for Nominating Committee .. Both the Nominating Committee and the Honors Committee are elected at the business meeting at the convention . I hope that we can rally our forces to attend the business meeting in New York in April and vote for Arlene . ( Loyd 1975 ) <p> Although Palm was elected to the council , action in the AAG office sidelined Rengert 's nomination . Correspondence between Loyd and Executive Director Warren Nystrom indicates that he assured her in December 1975 that the required petitions had been received and that Rengert 's name would appear , but it did not . " Many people who planned to vote for Arlene were startled to find that her name was omitted . What happened ? How can we avoid this problem next year ? Please let me know how this mix-up occurred " ( Loyd 1976 ) . The following year the effort was successful . Rengert was elected to the Nominating Committee , as was Alice Rechlin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for National Council and Evelyn Pruitt a vice-presidential nominee , along with Allan Pred . I was elected , but others took up the petition strategy and nominated John Fraser Hart , who was elected over Pruitt and Pred . <p> The politics of the 1970s instigated a significant change in the gender makeup of the AAG leadership and a more activist stance on issues of discrimination and affirmative action . Whereas until 1970 only three women had ever been elected to office , ten were elected in the 1970s , six as national councillors , one as treasurer , and three as regional councillors . At the end of the decade , four women were on the council simultaneously . Political issues relating to women surfaced on the agenda . The council approved sending a ballot to the membership on the question of boycotting meeting sites in states that had not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment . After the boycott lost in a close vote , it was discovered that spousal members had been sent only one ballot per couple and that some photocopied ballot forms had been received . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated , although the council decided not to select non-ERA states for meetings . This electoral defeat might seem to indicate that AAG members were more conservative than were their peers in other scholarly and professional societies , many of which had supported a boycott . Similarly , other organizations , including the American Anthropological Association , had developed procedures for censuring departments that did not make progress in employing women ( Rubin 1979 ) . National survey data published in 1970 on the political views of faculty across disciplines identified geographers as considerably more conservative than other social scientists ( AAG 1970 ) . Patricia McWethy ( 1981 ) , the AAG 's new executive director , acknowledged in the CSWG newsletter that the AAG had been slower than many other professional societies to engage with affirmative action . <p> In 1979 the AAG Council adopted a bylaw on affirmative action which specified that the association " shall not discriminate on grounds unrelated to professional competence . and shall promote affirmative action among its members and the institutions with which they are affiliated with respect to hiring , admission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication , and other professional activities " ( AAG 2004a ) . This bylaw emerged from a report to the council prepared by Regional Councillor Jacquelyn Beyer ( 1979 ) that also included an array of recommendations for a coherent affirmative-action policy . A grievance procedure was created , although , at least in promotion and tenure matters , I am aware of only one occasion on which it has been used : my own appeal of tenure denial , an appeal prompted partly by a desire to test the process . The case largely demonstrated that the AAG lacked effective power in complaints against universities ( Holcomb and others 1987 ) . <p> More successfully , Bonnie Loyd , Arlene Rengert , and I , with assistance from the AAG central office , especially of Educational Affairs Director Sam Natoli , submitted a proposal through the association to the Women 's Educational Equity Act Program . Using the ambitious title " Overcoming Masculine Bias in Introductory College Geography , " we were funded to create curriculum materials that would introduce the new research on women into undergraduate courses in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum reform to the National Council for Geographic Education and guest edited a special issue of the Journal of Geography on teaching about women ( 1978 ) . GEOGRAPHERS FOR WOMEN 'S ACHIEVEMENT <p> In November 1972 a newsletter was launched " aimed at the interests of women geographers : their status , advancement , work , and research . This newsletter is intended as a communications link for all women in the discipline , whatever their professional memberships " ( Newsletter 1972 , 1 ) . The title captures the mood of activist women geographers and their advocates in the 1970s , including Wilbur Zelinsky . In reviewing that decade , I have explored the ways in which women 's personal expectations changed and in which they worked politically to challenge professional institutions , especially at the national level . As they were growing up and entering higher education , most of my respondents did not anticipate academic careers , although they later often recollected aspirations for a world that was wider than was conventional for women . Feminist consciousness was heightened by experiences in graduate school and early years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also of challenge to professional and educational institutions by the women 's movement . In the face of substantial obstacles and resistance , but with support from some enlightened men faculty , spouses , and peers , the representation of women among doctoral recipients and geography faculty increased notably in the 1970s . Collective action questioned practices in some departments and worked to change the policies and leadership of the AAG . Nevertheless , we should not forget that many talented women who invested in graduate education are " missing " today in academic geography . Entrenched attitudes , lack of mentoring , the precarious state of academic labor markets , and the limited efficacy of federal policies all impinged on women 's advancement in the academy . We do not know the extent to which these women have found satisfying professional and personal lives or draw on their geographical expertise . Some clearly have found significant alternatives . Exploration of their careers would be an important endeavor , especially as the discipline seeks to widen its presence in society. ( n6 ) <p> Over the long term the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discipline and its institutions . The flourishing field of feminist research and teaching in geography , first acknowledged in Zelinsky 's coauthored article in 1982 , speaks to the significance of their intellectual leadership . At the institutional level , a number of women who entered geography in the 1970s have gone on not only to senior academic ranks but to chair departments and achieve honors . Five of the women of that decade have joined Wilbur Zelinsky in assuming the title of AAG president , a marked contrast to the previous eight decades , in which only one woman held the office . His 1973 articles stand as landmarks in documenting women 's status and sounded a clarion call for action . We remain indebted to his vision and leadership . FOOTNOTES <p> ( <p>
