Giverny , 1907 <p> Quickly Emile took out the green wooden rowboat to lift fallen leaves off the pond . When Monsieur would come out of the pink stucco house at six in the morning , it had to be just right . With no breeze yet , the water lay like a liquid mirror , and Monsieur would want to paint the rosy clouds reflected among the water lilies . Emile trimmed a few errant lily pads overgrowing the shapes Monsieur ranted about keeping just so . He knew what Monsieur wanted . <p> At the pond 's edge , he leaned to the side of the boat to cut off agapanthus , irises , azaleas , and rhododendrons that were spent , careful not to leave a blunt end visible . He could not reach the lily of the valley spilling over in bunches and sending its slightly acid scent out through its inverted cups . He 'd have to snip them on foot . The other workers did the fertilizing , watering , and greenhouse work with bulbs and seedlings , but Emile did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught him how much Monsieur wanted left-a profusion of plants just short of the point of excess . He had to create anew , every day , that single point the master wanted between the presence and absence of a gardener 's hand . <p> One enormous deep violet blue bearded iris thrust itself before a fan of sword-shaped leaves . He 'd been watching it grow . No doubt Monsieur had noticed it , too , but as far as Emile could tell , he had n't begun a painting of it . Today was the day . The bloom was at its bursting peak , puffed out like a dowager queen in regal velvet wearing a sdewdrop jewel . There was not sky enough to contain it . He might be able to get it home and be back before Monsieur came out to paint . Ginette would think it spectacular . She always received the flowers he brought her with that round O her lips made at surprises , and then the hint of a sigh . Blossoms would not last . No matter how moist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead the moment their stems were cut . <p> What would Ginette do for flowers after he was gone ? The thought troubled him more since the pricks of pain had begun in his chest . <p> He looked over his shoulder at the windows in the house and snipped off the iris for his wife , feeling only a fraction of the guilt he 'd felt the first time . God would forgive him in the name of love , even if Monsieur would n't . <p> The porch door banged , and rapid footsteps crunched the coarse sand pathway . <p> " Emile , " Monsieur bellowed . <p> He felt a tiny pain , or was it his imagination ? He hid the iris behind his feet under the boat 's crossbench . <p> " Clemenceau is coming . On Sunday . And Jean and Blanche . To see the tulips and cherry trees in bloom . Everything must be at its best . Transplant if you need to . " Still in his dressing gown , Monsieur waved his arm toward the pathway . " Nasturtiums are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not actually . Leave space for two to walk abreast . Will you have time to repaint the rest of the woodwork ? " <p> Emile had finished the green porch railing and morning bench-Prussian green , Monsieur would call it-and , the day before , he 'd repainted the underside of the Japanese bridge from the rowboat so that green would reflect in the water . His neck still ached . What remained were the clematis trellis along the wall and the large railed storage boxes for unfinished canvases situated in unobtrusive spots in the garden . <p> " Of course , " Emile said . <p> Monsieur stopped moving suddenly and looked curiously at the spot on the bank where the giant iris had grown . A scowl darkened his face , and his big fingers curled into a fist . Emile shifted in the boat to hide the iris better . A bee buzzing near his feet threatened to give him away . Monsieur snapped his head to peer at him for a long moment . How could he not know ? Ever since they kneeled together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a violet and yellow pansy face and hid it up his full sleeve-but this iris was no mere pansy . It was the grandest bloom in an Eden of blooms . Had he gone too far ? <p> " Alors , bien " Monsieur said , gave an abrupt nod , and strode back to the house . <p> Even with the quick trot home midmorning to take the iris to Ginette , by noon Emile had finished the tulip beds and tied the clippings in burlap to lay out to dry behind the wall for burning . He was pleased , now , to put away his clippers and take out his brushes and paint can . <p> Monsieur 's morning work apparently went well , too . Emile heard no lion 's roar across the pond . Monsieur was prone to fits of despair that often led to rash acts . Madame Alice always said the right thing to her husband , and so effortlessly , but Emile had to think out the words to say ahead of time in case she was n't there . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur had bellowed a loud " ooff . " Hearing the clatter and splash , Emile had called to Madame Alice and rowed quickly out to the Epte , thinking that Monsieur had fallen in . His easel and canvas were floating . " I 'm through , Emile , " he said and threw in his palette , tubes , and brushes . He stepped from the large flatboat into Emile 's rowboat . " I 'm not a painter . Row me home . " <p> Emile tried to save the canvas . " Let it go , Emile ! " Corning into the pond in the rowboat , he saw Alice and repeated , " I 'm not a painter , Alice . " <p> " Today , maybe not . But tomorrow , yes , " she said . " In the meantime , this afternoon you 've got to plan the colors for the new flower bed with Emile . " <p> By the next morning Monsieur had a new idea and was calling for more paints . To be so little at peace-Emile felt sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would see it , but he wondered whether Monsieur was happy the way he was happy , hurrying the perfect iris home to Ginette . <p> Only last month , Monsieur had begun to slash for burning thirty of the water lily canvases . " Once I 'm dead no one will destroy any of my paintings , no matter how bad they are , " he 'd said . <p> Madame Alice stood on the porch and watched , gripping the railing with hands as white as her hair . " Help him , Emile . He ca n't be dissuaded . He 'll paint more , and better ones . " <p> With aching heart , Emile had helped to lay the fire . <p> " Is n't there one of these you would n't mind if I took for Ginette ? " <p> " No , " he bellowed . " Burn them all . " With his razor Monsieur hacked another canvas out of its frame and threw it to the sground . <p> The bonfire rose into the night sky , and Monsieur watched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a year was only embers . Emile took care to pour water on the mound before he went home . <p> " You mean to say you 've broken your back for him all these years , and he would n't even give you one painting he did n't want ? " Ginette had said . " You , who dug that pond with your bare hands and created something that made him rich and famous ? He 'd rather burn them than give you a scrap ! " <p> Emile shrugged and fell into bed exhausted , smelling the smoke on his skin and mustache . <p> Early the next morning he found that they had overlooked one elongated triangle of sliced canvas . It was covered with ashes and dirt , but still intact . He swept it up and stuffed it under his shirt , apologizing to God for his disobedience , and only then looked around to see if someone was watching . No one was up yet . He 'd hardly seen the thing , and as he felt it stiff and scratchy against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was agitated with curiosity . <p> When the sun finally dipped behind the plum trees , he tramped home through the field of wild red poppies , his heart hammering in his chest . He did n't take out the slash of canvas until he had bolted the door behind him . Gently he washed off the ashes and dirt . Brush strokes of lavender , blues , and greens swirled in what might be an oval if the piece were larger . Just colors , he thought , sinking into a chair , until he turned it upside down . Thick paint rose in ridges for part of a lily . Next to it , smooth for a willow leaf . It was something . <p> Breathless , he showed it to Ginette . <p> " What is it ? " she asked . <p> " A hanging willow leaf and half a lily . A flower that will last . " <p> " He gave that to you ? " <p> " No . If he knows I have it , he 'll be raving mad . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then what will become of us ? " <p> " It 's for you , Ginette . For our bedroom . Do n't tell a soul . " <p> That Sunday , he worked all afternoon to fit the joints for a little triangular wooden frame . He sanded it smooth as satin and painted it with Monsieur 's green paint he had taken in a pickle jar . Nothing else seemed so right . And every night since , before he turned out the light , he looked at the sliver of painting above Ginette 's dressing table with satisfaction . Ginette would always have a flower . <p> Now , after the midday supper , Emile lifted a veil of blue , pink , and white clematis away from the trellis so he could paint it . <p> " Painting again ? " Felix , the newest gardener , asked with a tone of derision . <p> " Clemenceau is coming . If you feed the geraniums on the porch , they might open out by Sunday . " <p> " Why paint the back ? It 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " No , but I can . And you can . " <p> Felix shrugged and went on by . He 's too young to understand my satisfactions , Emile thought . <p> With the corner of his brush Emile lifted off a bristle that had stuck to the wood . He liked painting things almost as much as gardening , and so would not give it up to the younger men . He liked that creamy feeling of dipping the brush . He often said a little prayer , " a la grace de Dieu " before that treacherous moment of swinging the loaded brush from can to trellis , over the clematis so not a single drop would mar a leaf or petal . Then there came the pleasure of the smooth spread of shining color until he felt a slight drag on the brush telling him he needed more paint . He loved all these feelings just as much as Monsieur did . He was certain of that . <p> " Ooff ! It 's maddening , " Monsieur cried from somewhere near the pond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor man 's railing again , Emile thought , pained by his disquietude . He finished the trellises and started on a storage box in a swirl of perfumes-the spicy clovelike scent of pink dianthus and the sweetness of roses like a balm . <p> " I 'm no better than a pig . I know nothing ! " he heard . <p> Monsieur 's sabots scraped the pebbled path . Emile smelled his cigarette and saw out of the corner of his eye Monsieur 's fist hanging like a small ham . " Do n't you ever find it hard to do what you have in mind ? " Monsieur asked and lifted his slouch hat to wipe his forehead with his handkerchief . <p> " No . I just keep things in mind that are possible . " <p> " Where 's the joy in that ? " <p> " Look around you . This garden . It 's full of joy . Always we keep the possible in mind . Now you want the impossible . You 'll want to paint the scent of flowers next . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeds underwater , the water 's surface , and the sky reflected , all of that at once . What 's impossible about that ? " <p> " Only God- " <p> " I want to do it . " <p> " You will , God willing . You are . " <p> Monsieur was looking at a white clematis blossom as though he 'd never seen one before . " My God , how exquisite . " He shook his head . " What a confounded profession . No matter what beautiful thing I see , it 's too hard . It 's beyond an old man 's powers . " <p> Emile dipped his brush and watched the bristles puncture the smooth green surface of the paint in the can . <p> " Hand me that brush , " Monsieur demanded . " Let me paint something I can . " <p> " No ! " <p> The word struck like a deep bell in the quiet garden . He had never contradicted him before . Monsieur stood for a long time with his big hand out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperamental genius . Emile took only shallow breaths . <p> He had come to work for Monsieur when the Japanese cherry trees were only spindles . Together they 'd kneeled to plant the first blue forget-me-nots to harmonize with mauve tulips and pink peonies . He 'd been here before there was a Japanese bridge , before the roses climbed the arching trellises of the Grande Allee . All those years . Never a disagreement . <p> Emile drew the brush across the wood . " This is mine to do , " he said . " You do yours . " He felt a ping in his chest . Even if he had to fight him , ridiculous at their age , he would not give over the brush . He tightened his grip , in case the man would grab . <p> A thrush sang a short flutelike song , and after a long pause , did it again , as though he could n't help it . They waited without moving for the third song , and at last it came . Monsieur turned and walked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emile heard him shove the painting into a garden box . He did n't move until he heard him pull out another . <p> Something about the way he 'd said " beyond an old man 's powers " touched him more than Monsieur 's ravings ever had . They were both old men , but Emile was older , and likely to die first . And then what about Ginette 's little scrap of painting ? She might try to sell it-need might force her-and Monsieur might learn of it . <p> But there was something else . Monsieur had a right to choose what remained of him , just like he did-the smooth green coating on this box , for example-and if Monsieur thought a single lily was beyond his powers , then it should not remain . He could not violate the man that way . <p> He finished the box and cleaned his brush carefully , thinking again-what would she do for flowers after he was gone ? If he took the lily from her ? <p> He hurried out the gate , across the field through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God would not let him stumble and break a leg and die in the dirt track , would not let his heart stop beating before he could get home to build a little fire of kindling in the grate and place on it the slice of both their masterworks .
