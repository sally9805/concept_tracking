<p> LIFE &; THE CITY <p> On the way home , I 've got the Buick really moving  --  75 mph easy  --  when a black blur with shiny rims nearly clips my front bumper , sweeps across three lanes and zooms into the distance . <p> It makes me smile . The Idiot 500  --  my beloved Dan Ryan  --  is back . <p> Only it 's wider , smoother and without a single pothole . Twelve minutes . That 's how long it takes to get from downtown to 95th when you 're keeping up with traffic . <p> As I hit the Bishop Ford , it dawns on me that this means farewell to Stony Island  --  my alternate route downtown during nearly two years of construction . <p> Part of me will miss it . <p> Growing up in the south suburbs , Stony Island was a street that a lot of folks avoided because it ran through a rough part of the city , where counter girls at the best places to grab a quick bite took your order from behind bulletproof glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyde Park to 95th has cleaned up considerably  --  not that I would 've known much about that until the Dan Ryan makeover forced me that way . <p> But after countless trips downtown , I can tell you Stony Island gives you a peek at neighborhoods  --  Calumet Heights , Pill Hill , Avalon Park , Grand Crossing , Park Manor , Woodlawn and South Shore  --  that are pure grit . <p> You 're rolling through parts of town where people do n't go unless they have to  --  where folks still hustle to get ahead . Sometimes right on the street . <p> Every day can be an adventure . <p> Get caught at the light at 95th or 79th and you 'll see guys hawking all kinds of stuff  --  fruit bags , roasted peanuts , candy , bottled water , tube socks , face towels , bean pies , flashing fake teeth or Sponge Bob balloons . <p> And at Smart Thrift , a junk store in the Skyway ramp 's shadow , guys fill the parking lot with all kinds of loot at 9 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . <p> The guy who runs the place ( when I asked his name he said to call him " Mudd " ) says having all that stuff outside grabs attention  --  like a " little Maxwell Street market everyday . " <p> Most of what 's for sale there comes from unclaimed storage spaces and foreclosed homes . The place is a treasure hunter 's dream . Or if you 're on tight budget , it 's the spot to get a VCR , exercise machine , spare tire , china hutch , 10-speed bike , fashion wig , high heels or a busted office chair for cheap . <p> There 's a fair share of boarded up business , seedy hotels and vacant lots littering Stony Island , but the avenue has its jewels , too . <p> A couple of blocks away from Smart Thrift is an unofficial South Side landmark  --  the 1941 Buick sedan atop Ellison Auto Parts . <p> Owner Paul Fields opened the shop in 1962 , back when Stony Island was still " automotive row " and Ernie Banks had a dealership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old car on the roof ? <p> " So people would ask me why I put it there , " Fields says . " That , and it makes it easy to give directions . " <p> The bullet holes in the Buick 's doors tell you about the neighborhood struggles . <p> " I used to have trouble with people throwing snowballs at it , " Fields says . " As the neighborhood got rougher , people started shooting instead . Fortunately , I was never in the car when it happened . " <p> And just east of Stony on 79th is the New Regal Theater , a city landmark by architect John Eberson , who said the building design was inspired by a Persian incense burner he found at an antique market . <p> Head north a bit and there 's the Mosque Maryam , the Nation of Islam headquarters , which is so beautiful a reporter pal of mine says it 's worth getting frisked at the door to get a look inside . <p> Hungry ? There 's plenty of grub on Stony Island , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can get a delicious piece of salmon at BJ 's Market , sample tasty soul food treats at the Soul Queen 's buffet . There 's enough fried chicken joints for you to visit a different one every night , and the not-so historic site of the South Side 's first Starbucks . <p> If you prefer to make dinner yourself , a stop at the Moo &; Oink  --  Stony Island 's premier butcher shop  --  is a must . You can get juicy chicken breasts for 89 cents a pound , and some tasty baby back ribs that cook up nice on the grill . <p> And so many drivers stop to pick up a six-pack at Kenwood Liquors  --  which boasts on its billboard " No gimmicks . No advertising . Just the cheapest , lowest and least expensive prices in the world "  --  there 's almost always a beer-run traffic jam at 87th Street during the evening rush . <p> " Some people have told me they think the Stony Island route still is n't a bad idea for getting to the museums or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , " says Jon Dixon , who helps run the family business . " And I think they 're right . I can only hope . " <p> That makes me feel better about getting back on the Ryan .
