Budget stuffers Congress <p> T is the season . . . President Bush is set to sign a $388 billion federal budget package as early as this week . The measure puts the squeeze on government agencies in an effort to get a grip on the ballooning federal deficit . But that did n't stop lawmakers from loading it up with a passel of pet projects  --  no matter how seemingly wasteful or frivolous . Among them : $50,000 to study ways to deal with wild-hog control in Missouri ; $350,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland ; and $335,000 to protect North Dakota 's sunflowers from blackbirds . Lawmakers had no shame . In fact , they went out of their way to take credit for slipping in loads of pork . And why would n't they ? Constituents ( read : voters ) love it when their reps bring home the bacon . But not everyone was thrilled . An outraged Sen. John McCain took his colleagues to task for loading up the bill with so much lard , citing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I am hoping that the appropriators could explain to me why we need $1 million for this . Are American shrimp unruly and lacking initiative ? " McCain asked . " Why does the U.S. taxpayer need to fund this ' no shrimp left behind act ' ? " The Deer hunter Crime <p> In the deep fall woods of Wisconsin last week , a lone hunter allegedly turned his gun on his fellow deer hunters , killing six men , including a father and son , and injuring two others . Chai Vang , 36 , of St. Paul , Minn. , is being held on $2.5 million bond in connection with the incident . Vang , an immigrant from Laos , reportedly told police that he started firing after other hunters taunted him with racial slurs and shot at him ; one of the surviving hunters disputed his version . <p> Investigators are exploring a possible link between Vang and the unsolved murder of a hunter in a neighboring county three years ago . Be prepared Security <p> Lest anyone let down their guard during holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio , and Internet spots as part of its Ready ( or Listo , en espanol ) campaign urging families to be prepared in case of a terrorist attack . " The message is simple : Everyone should have a plan , " said Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge . " I hope these ads will encourage parents to take a little time to sit down and map out their family emergency plan today , so they 're prepared for a terrorist attack . . . or any emergency in the future . " What should you do ? Get an emergency supply kit , draw up a family emergency plan  --  like designating a meeting point in the event of a terrorist strike  --  and stay on top of emergencies that could occur and plan the appropriate responses . <p> For more info , log on to a Department of Homeland Security website , www.Ready.gov . Anchor(s) away Media <p> It will be the end of an era when Dan Rather steps down next year as anchor of the CBS Evening News . " It has been , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each evening , and I thank you for the trust you 've given me , " Rather , 73 , said last week in announcing that he 's signing off for good on March 9  --  exactly 24 years after he took the reins from Walter Cronkite . Rather will remain at CBS as a full-time correspondent for 60 Minutes . The move was not entirely unexpected : It came just weeks after Rather was forced to make an on-air apology after airing a story about holes in President Bush 's National Guard duty that was apparently based on phony documents . The outgoing anchor , known for his Texas drawl and colorful down-home commentary , became a household name in 1974 after a tart exchange with President Nixon : When Rather  --  ever the lightning rod  --  rose to ask a question , some colleagues applauded , and others booed . Their reaction prompted Nixon to ask , " Are you running for something ? " Rather quickly shot back , " No , sir , Mr. President . Are you ? " The incident almost got Rather fired  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal media . While reviled by the political right , the award-winning Rather won the respect of many colleagues and viewers for his hard-hitting reports from from hot spots like Vietnam and Afghanistan . His resignation leaves ABC News 's Peter Jennings as the only Big Three old-timer staying in the anchor 's chair ; Brian Williams takes over for Tom Brokaw at NBC News this week . <p> No word on Rather 's successor ; CBS newsers John Roberts and Scott Pelley are on a short list . Basketbrawl <p> Indiana 's Ron Artest was suspended for the season for fighting with fans . He and others could also face criminal charges . Say a little prayer Environment <p> Could it be ? Could church be bad for your health  --  literally ? A new study shows that burning candles and incense in churches releases dangerous levels of potentially cancer-causing pollutants , some at levels 20 times as high as the European Union limit . Researchers from Maastricht University in the Netherlands analyzed the air in a small chapel and large basilica in Maastricht . Their findings : After nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had four times as many pollutants during a mock evening mass as during morning masses . The report bolsters earlier studies that indicate increasing risks from " indoor pollution " like smoking . " After a day of candle burning , " said study author Theo de Kok , " we found about 20 times as much pollution in the churches as by a busy road . " So , should you worry ? Researchers said that priests , choir members , and other church workers are much more at risk than occasional churchgoers . Better ventilation , they say , would help  --  you know , open doors , windows . . . that sort of thing . <p> So much for relaxing  --  not to mention praying  --  by candlelight . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Exit Strategy : Rather , reporting from Vietnam in 1966 .
