They lived in Tennessee for five months . George had wanted to move there to play guitar , an idea he seized on late one night , in the hopeful , dreamy fog of too much youth and too many beers . When promise is like a drug , the stars are supernatural , water is glass . There , in the bedroom , he took Natalie 's wide smile as encouragement , proof that Nashville , with its history and sentiment , was where he should go . Glow-in-the-dark planets , courtesy of a previous tenant , dotted the ceiling . Saturn , a comet with a perfect , cartoonish tail . Sometimes , deep in the evening , a look is all the evidence and spur you need . <p> They had been together three months , in a relationship born in the manic weeks before college graduation , when everything seemed alternately possible and impossible , serious and trivial . Though they had been in school for the same four years , they barely knew each other-they were friends of friends of friends , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands . Early on they figured out they had taken the same introduction to psychology course freshman year , them and two hundred other students stuffed into a lecture hall with tiered rows of seats and a professor overly fond of his laser pointer . One night at a party George had wandered outside and overheard Natalie talking to one of her friends . " I hate my body , " she said . " All it does is hurt me . " He knew it was far from original for a woman , especially one in college , to hate her body , but he had never heard it so concisely and logically expressed . ( Never mind that she had a very beautiful body , one that probably , more likely , only hurt other people , mostly through withholding . ) <p> He told himself that he would n't go to sleep until he kissed her . We can end all the hurting from this night on , he thought . I 'll take you away from all that . They ended up in her off-campus apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by half-packed boxes and walls scabbed with poster tape and picture hooks . Modern hieroglyphs , people with too much time , too many idols , too much belief in genius . They drank , smoked , laughed . They kissed , turned the stereo up loud , filled the ashtray to overflowing . There was something liberating , something temporary in the room . When you know you are leaving somewhere , you are free ; you can atone later , in another city , another time . With a new name , a job and a house and car payments , the furl of responsibilities , the landmarks that begin to sum up your life . A small TV on mute painted the corner of the room different colors . Across the street , yellowed windows of a freshman dorm formed a maddening , unreadable Morse code . There was beauty in the smallest , most unassuming things , and space enough to fuck and fight , be saint or sinner . <p> Before either of them realized , they were in a relationship . Natalie had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off for a few months , to spend the summer and fall in Nashville with George . Her parents were skeptical , which made it all the more alluring . She sent postcards-dolled-up countrymusic stars with paint-white teeth-just to tweak them . They rented a small apartment , stuffed it with dishes and silverware and paintings from thrift stores . They slept on a mattress on the floor , in a bedroom conquered by George 's guitars and amps . Pedals and amps were planted across the carpet like landmines . She put candles and plants in the windowsills , tending to each as if they were children . She learned to fall asleep even while he practiced , came to depend on it like a pill . <p> Later , when winter was just starting to strip away the hopeful Tennessee light , they moved to California , joining the hordes seduced by Internet jobs and shambling Victorian houses . George had agreed only after Natalie promised they could stop in Bakersfield-home of Buck Owens-on the way out . They had little trouble finding work : Natalie toiled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar store , where all of his coworkers had stardom on their minds and none would admit it . They thought fame and money were like a stain . <p> Sam Rhodes was an architect . His parents had sent him to all the right schools-East Coast and elite-and he had sailed through , branded along the way , by teachers and classmates alike , as " promising . " It is a word , Sam realized later , that confers not only praise but carries responsibility , and the more " promising " people told him he was , the less capable he felt of delivering on their expectations . <p> Still , he managed to tamp down his anxiety for long enough to finish graduate school and land coveted apprentice jobs in New York and Los Angeles . There he watched buildings grow , jump from drafting tables to plywood-fenced construction zones to finished products . It was an amazing process , he thought , to see something transform from ink and sketch and blueprint to sidewalk and sky . Often he did n't entirely believe the buildings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right up to one of the outside walls and thumb it , to make sure the steel skeleton was no mirage . Some of them sliced upward , sleek as blades ; others sat long and squat , one or two stories . <p> The rhetoric he had grown so weary of in school-the poetics of space , deconstructive tendencies , wry commentaries , sly references-sounded far less hollow and tired in the architects ' offices . This is where buildings originate , Sam thought , not a place where we are merely studying them . For a time he was reenergized , and he logged late nights in the office , him and the other young assistants , puzzling over heating ducts , oxidized aluminum flashing , roof slopes , and sandblasted glass . They lined up their empty Dr Pepper cans like bowling pins , toppling them with punted Styrofoam scraps . <p> It was tiring , satisfying work , and he would return home exhausted but invigorated . He was newly married , a year and a half , and his wife accepted the punishing hours partly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule , too , because he assured her it would get better , that all new architects put in eighty-hour workweeks while they establish themselves and perfect their vision . " There 's no other way , " he said . " You just have to totally immerse yourself . It 's like learning a foreign language . " <p> She would sit with him late at night , at the kitchen table , while he ate microwaved leftovers . She drank wine , watched him bring his fork to his mouth , listened to the projects that had kept him away so long . It was sexy to her , seeing him so in the grip of something , looking at his eyes and imagining the brain behind them , electric and searching , the neurons firing nonstop . " When will you build me a house , Sam ? " she asked , curling into his lap and pulling his silverware out of his hand so she could latch her fingers in his . " When ? " <p> It was late at night when it happened-more morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the vague hours between nighttime and next day , hours most people never pay attention to unless they 're forced . Natalie had been at a bar with friends , and they had ended up staying until last call , and then even later , courtesy of a bartender repaying them for a steady stream of tips and a pinball machine intent on volunteering free games even though they were nowhere near the high scores . <p> She had had an argument with George earlier in the evening , and he had stormed out of the bar , one of their favorite places , tucked between a seedy motel and a warehouse district . It was a throwaway fight-days later neither of them could remember the details-yet it turned , quickly , into something more dramatic . Even when you have nothing to fight about , you find something . It 's like pricking yourself with a pin : proof that you are alive and can hurt . It 's a way of confessing vulnerability . <p> After George had left the bar , one of Natalie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " <p> " Why ? " Natalie said . " I 'm staying . Fuck him . " <p> She knew , the moment the words tumbled from her mouth , that she would forgive him , probably only hours later . The jukebox would tell her to , Cheap Trick , AC/DC , Charlie Rich ; a drink would tell her , maybe nothing more than a boy sitting at a table in the back and the way the boy held his Budweiser , which was like the way George did , but not exactly . His forefinger was a little more pointed . He had the same boots , with a steel toe and pale yellow stitching . Some girl would find this boy , tonight or next week or next year , and figure out how much love he had to give . Natalie thought , in the energizing aftermath of a fight , how lucky she was to have someone to forgive . There were so many people who did n't . <p> Sam and Jessica soon had a baby , Sabrina , born healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved north , to San Francisco , where Sam had decided to open his own practice , banking on a steady stream of newly minted computer-industry millionaires eager to cash in their stock options for a daring building . Sabrina was a difficult baby-colicky all the time , fussy , relentlessly demanding . She strained the marriage like nothing else had , and their near constant exhaustion left them ill-equipped to deal with the emotional tangles they soon faced . The stress of Sam running his own practice did n't help , either . <p> Sam began to feel , once more , as if he was always disappointing people : his clients , his wife , his daughter . When his parents called and asked when they would be able to see a building he had designed , he muttered , " Never , " right before begging off the phone because Sabrina was screaming from her crib , having woken up prematurely from a nap . He went to the baby 's room and picked her up from the foam mattress . He was always amazed at how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . He hooked his hands under her arms and held her in front of him like a cross . She had his wife 's pale blue eyes , and her hair was just beginning to thicken . She was dressed in one of the endless Baby Gap outfits that had begun to multiply in the house like some unstoppable bacteria . " Sabrina , honey , shh , shh , " he said . " Just wait , baby girl , you have the whole rest of your life to find things to cry about . Right now you have no idea . " <p> What finally set him off was the alumni magazine . He arrived home one night , after a day in which he learned that a promising client had dropped him , and found his wife on the couch leafing through his architecture-school magazine . On the cover was one of his classmates , smiling , next to a blueprint for the new Portland Museum of Art in Maine . Sam snatched the magazine from Jessica 's hands , in a movement so sudden it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell , " she said . " What are you doing ? " <p> " I 've had a crappy enough day already , " he said , burying the magazine in the newspaper recycling pile . " I do n't need to come home to my wife fawning over that frat-boy shithead Andy Dalton . " <p> She sighed , put the lone remaining page on the coffee table . Something about the way she did it , carefully , so it would n't sail off , fanned his rage . He grabbed it from the glass surface , balled it up , and threw it in the trash . <p> " Jesus , " she said . " Calm down . " <p> " What if I do n't want to ? " <p> " You 've been drinking , have n't you ? " <p> He did n't answer her . Because he had . To blunt the disappointment of losing a client , he had poured himself whiskey from a bottle he kept at the office . He had bought it originally to celebrate his successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sting of failure . <p> " So what if I have , " he said . " I 'm allowed . Wan na card me ? " <p> " Keep your voice down , " Jessica said . " You 'll wake the baby . " <p> " She 'll go back to sleep . " <p> " No , " said Jessica , " she might not . Actually , odds are she wo n't . " <p> Then there was a silence between them , tight and angry . It was the sound of something unresolved , many things unresolved . <p> Years earlier they would have choked this fight with a kiss , a finger trailing down a cheek . Some small essential physical gesture , assurance that the blowup would n't ruin them , leave them shipwrecked and alone . But this time it was different . Too much unsaid had passed between them in the preceding eight months . Sam had suffered a series of setbacks at work ; Jessica was more and more frustrated and exhausted from taking care of Sabrina . They had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to talk about it , hoping that a single event-a major commission for Sam , Sabrina suddenly turning angelic-would change their course . Remake them into the couple they wanted to be . <p> The wealthy , open-minded clients never materialized . Sabrina grew , if anything , even fussier , more demanding . Their pediatrician assured them nothing was wrong . Some babies are just difficult , he said , not much you can do about it . He told them to be patient , and they nodded and forced smiles and thought , Fuck you , no one is this patient . <p> Sam 's cocktail hour crept earlier , lasted longer , and within a year he had to shut down his practice because he lacked clients . He made several perfunctory inquiries about joining other firms , but an abundance of pride prevented him from seriously considering working for someone else . Jessica sensed his hesitation and said to him one day , " I do n't see what the big deal is . You did it before , for years . " <p> " Exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Well ... " She did n't finish her sentence . <p> " ' Well ' what , Jess ? " He always shortened her name when he was angry with her . He knew she hated it . <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Come on , Jess , say it . Tell me obviously I 'm not past working for someone else . Tell me that if I were , then clearly I would n't be in this position . Tell me how much I suck . " <p> She folded her arms in front of her chest . " I 'm not talking to you when you 're like this , " she said . <p> " Good . " <p> When she told him she was moving out , Sam was n't surprised . He was almost relieved . Their small house had become a cold war , week after week of indicting , brittle tension . Ironically , just as they were reaching their unavoidable separation , Sabrina started behaving much better . She cried less , slept more . Her smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her toys at a pace that was nearly alarming . <p> There were moments she forced Sam and Jessica together . A new physical coordination she mastered , a word she was circling ever closer to saying . They would gravitate toward each other , gazes focused on their child , sitting on the floor , perhaps unaware of the peacekeeper she had become . Occasionally they even touched , brushed shoulders , thighs , though nothing more . <p> And in the end those moments were n't enough . They were ephemeral , temporary as sirens and mist , little match for the loathing that blanketed Sam 's body . <p> George had been over it so many times . The whys and wheres and whens and all the torturing , unanswerable questions , the cancer of what-ifs . If they had n't gotten in a fight . If he had stayed at the bar . If she had left five minutes later , or ten minutes earlier . If they had moved to a different city . Even : if they had never met . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them knew what genuine violence was , the cloister of their verdant campus so lethally impenetrable . In its classrooms they had learned so much , and nothing that would save them . If they had never met , George reasoned , Natalie would never have been raped . She would n't have been in that bar with him , she would have spent her night elsewhere , surrounded by different people and different landmarks . He would n't have ruined her life . <p> Everyone-friends , family , shrinks , books and magazines-tried to assure him that it was n't his fault . They said it over and over again , like a mantra , and sometimes the effect of so much repetition is that you doubt it even more . The truest things are things you do n't need to keep telling yourself . They are things imbued in you like blood . He wanted to believe them , all of them , wanted to snap open his eyes one morning shaken by a realization : Yes , my girlfriend was raped ; no , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with it . Yet he never woke up like that , never went to sleep without revisiting that night and its unspooling , unstoppable horror . Him walking swiftly out of the bar , wanting to turn back and apologize but being too proud . Him leaving her alone and vulnerable . Giving her , handing her , to a monster . <p> Sam had checked into the motel because that is what he did every six months . He brought gin , sleeping pills , more . The desk clerk knew him because he had stayed there several times before , locking himself in a musty , $35-a-night room for three days of drinking and smoking and getting high and wondering if there was any mercy , some rest . Seventy-two hours of taking him away from the life he had fallen into and did n't know how to escape . When he was awake , he listened through the thin walls to the other guests coming and going . He heard fights , sex , mundane phone calls , sometimes just the buzz-saw snore of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could replay the details , yet it hardly mattered . Failed marriage , a daughter he was n't allowed to see , a slew of disappointments piled like bricks . Parents back East who told him he was n't welcome to contact them until he had solved his problems . Small tangles with the police . Each one was so intractable ; even if you fix one , there are ten others . <p> He had been arrested there before . A year ago , maybe two ; once you are far enough gone , the months and years merge together . It was a fight with a family from Utah , maybe Idaho-one of those states that seems more land and mountains than people-and they were having an argument that kept ballooning . The last thing Sam remembered was telling the man , " Fuck you . Fuck you , fuck your screaming family , fuck your RV , and fuck Disneyland-or wherever the fuck you 're headed to waste tons of money and wish you 'd never gotten married or had kids in the first place . Fuck all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away . <p> Natalie knew better . The lessons had been drilled in since elementary school , first in static film strips and then from the mouths of stiff police officers visiting the auditorium : Do n't walk home alone ; do n't stay out too late at night ; do n't talk to strangers . She knew better , and yet she didn't-or she thought it would n't hurt anyone if , just this once , she was a little reckless . She was smart , she knew how to handle herself . <p> She had wanted , in fact , to be alone . She thought the starry sky and chilly air might somehow scrub away the unpleasantness of earlier . The empty streets , the shuttered stores , the eighteen-wheelers with hulls outlined in white Christmas lights : There must be redemption and renewal somewhere . Small , unannounced things that rescue us . If she could find it , or if it could locate her , she would arrive home to George loving , with a sharp , deep wanting . Slip under the covers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , press her cheek against the back of his neck . You have to give up a little control , she had always thought , if you wanted to stumble into true happiness . Nothing calculated could ever make you feel good . She could kiss him into waking up , wrap her body in his , be grateful and quiet . Action , sounds , wordless . Moan , breathe , touch . <p> There was an old school bus . Sam remembered a rusting bus several blocks from the motel , tires melting into the pavement , hugging the curb by a warehouse . Half the windows were shattered , and the windshield wipers hung limply like crippled , useless arms . It seemed strange to him to see a school bus so late at night , idle , because they were vehicles for daytime . Beehives of swarming kids . In a few years Sabrina would be riding one , her face glued to the glass . <p> He had thought about sleeping there , wedging open the door and just lying down on one of the cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip and boasts and slander of teenagers . He had been on those buses , years ago , one of a boisterous thousand who could n't sit still , who liked to look down at the passing cars . The driver tried to quiet them with threats and rewards , but little worked . Not songs , not candy , not the dark cloud of a report to the principal . There was something inevitable and innocent about the chaos . It was just children spilling all their endless energy . <p> Beyond the school bus was an intersection , and the traffic lights had gone to flashing because it was so late . Yellow in one direction , red in the other . He stopped on that corner , too , let the pulses mesmerize him for a moment . Maybe you can see the blinking lights from the bus , he thought , maybe the city 's electric heart will lull me to sleep . Maybe , Sam thought , the buildings and all their taunting will finally blacken . <p> Then he saw her . She was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , too , and she picked up her pace . She had the gait of someone buzzed , trying to make sure her steps were straight , knowing they probably were n't . Her knees came up higher than necessary on each stride . He followed her , and her strides got even quicker . She was wearing jeans , sneakers , a windbreaker that billowed with the breeze . <p> When they neared an alley , he grabbed her from behind . She yelped , but he managed to clamp his hand over her mouth to silence her . She struggled at first , until he punched her in the small of the back . She gasped and coughed and doubled over in pain , and her body tightened in shock . He yanked her back up and growled , in her ear , " Do n't . I 'll kill you if you fight . " He could smell the perfume on her , mixed with the residue of the bar . " You 're too pretty to fight , anyway . " <p> He took her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he unbuckled his belt , he said , " When I 'm finished , you 're going to face the brick wall and count to two hundred and do n't turn around and do n't start screaming for help . " She did n't do anything , and he said , " Do you understand ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " Good . " <p> He started pulling down her pants . She was n't struggling anymore , and her body was all slack , like a doll , only with human proportions . " Please , " she managed , and the word was little more than a hiccup , far too flimsy for what was about to happen . <p> It was the only thing she would say . She was silent while he worked on her , his pants around his ankles . No cars drove by , no planes scored the sky above . The only mark of this wreckage was the ugly , rhythmic slap of flesh against flesh . " Please , " she mumbled again , and the word sounded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . It was all about silencing , and he was going to keep screwing her until he stopped hearing the truth . <p> At the hospital , after she had spoken with a doctor and the police , a rape counselor came into Natalie 's room . She introduced herself and then turned , softly , to George , and said , " Sometimes this is easier if we 're alone . " George looked at Natalie . " It 's okay , " Natalie assured him . " Why do n't you get a cup of coffee . " <p> When George left the room , the counselor took the seat next to Natalie 's bed . " Have you been treated well here ? " she asked . " Is there anything I can bring you ? " <p> Natalie shook her head . <p> " Mostly I just wanted to introduce myself , " said the counselor . " Let you know that I 'm here if you ever want to talk . " <p> " I do n't want to talk , " Natalie said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon now . But I 'm going to leave you a card . When you 're feeling up to it , maybe in a few weeks or a few months , you can give me a call and we can make an appointment . I can meet you anywhere you want . I 'm available in the evening hours as well . " <p> " I said I do n't want to talk , " said Natalie . " Not now and not in a few weeks . If you leave a card , it 'll be a waste . Save it for someone who 's interested . " <p> The counselor opened her purse and started digging . <p> " I do n't want to talk because I know what you 're going to tell me : Rape is about power , not sex . It 's a crime , a violation , right ? " Natalie trailed a finger through her dirty hair . " I already know all that stuff , and it 's totally fucking unhelpful . It did n't help five hours ago , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months . It 's just words , some lame theory . It has nothing to do with the real world . " <p> The counselor nodded , laying a card on the bedside table . " We do n't have to talk about theories . We can talk about other things . " <p> Natalie thumbed a bruise on her wrist . " Theories , non-theories , I do n't want to talk about any of it . I just want to let this fade . I want ... I want ... I just want to go home . " She looked at the counselor . " Can you get my boyfriend and ask him to come in here ? " <p> A few minutes later , George returned to the room . Natalie was sitting on the edge of the bed and had her coat on already and was tying her shoes . She was having trouble tightening her right hand around the laces , so he crouched down to help her . <p> " Are you all done ? " he asked , palming her calf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the shoes and stood . " Was that woman helpful ? " <p> " No . " <p> " At all ? " <p> " No . " <p> He reached out his right hand to help her off the bed . She noticed his bloody knuckles and stared at them . <p> " Punched a wall , " he explained . <p> " Before or after ? " <p> " After . When you called from the hospital . " He remembered her voice , so shaky it almost was n't there . She took his hand , stood up , and they threaded their way out of the warrens of the emergency room , the sterile fluorescent light and efficient nurses making it impossible to hide anywhere . <p> After it happened , she did n't want to be touched and she did n't want George to not want to touch her . An impossible position to put him in , she knew , but she could n't help it . There was something reflexive , almost automatic about it . When she sensed him reaching for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let herself be held and wanted , but her body tensed up and there was no way she could pretend otherwise , no way she could veto the instinct . " Give me time , " she kept saying , " it 's bound to get easier . " He looked at her with such deep sadness and patience she nearly cried . And she thought maybe his unmitigated kindness , his boundless generosity , might soldier them through . His guitar strumming and his Merle Haggard records , skips and pops and all . One night , lying next to him , she palmed his chest , on the left side , as if the rich blood surging through his heart might somehow make its way to her body , where it could transfuse her own , replace tarnished with clean , weak with strong . Attacked with unattacked . <p> Sometimes she feared that she might simply crumple and vanish . Walking down a crowded sidewalk , her body would implode , shrink into nothingness , and her clothes would fall to the concrete in an unruly pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at them , the unoccupied shirt and jeans and sneakers , might stoop down and finger them and wonder where they came from . Maybe someone would look up , as if the garments had been dropped magically from the sky , so absent would any evidence of her body be . <p> Most victims of violent crimes hated to be alone . She had read this in articles and books , many sent by friends who were n't sure what to say so they let printed words stand in . She did n't hate them for it ; she understood it was a hard thing to talk about . But she actually craved time by herself , sought it out as much as possible . She avoided crowded parts of the city-Chinatown , the tourist-packed piers-and traveled instead to empty corners of Golden Gate Park . She gazed out at the bay and the bridge , tried to let the lilt of the water and the sinewy , muscular cables mold her back into what she used to be . During rush hour she let her vision blur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All those white lights , gem after gem heading home . When it was raining , she did n't even have to let her vision unlock . The lights turned fuzzy and warm on their own . <p> George flew back to Nashville . He did n't want to do it in San Francisco , did n't want to stain the pavement of her city with his blood . If it happened there , he knew she would have to leave , even if it occurred on a street she never walked by . She was like that : she put a lot of stake in symbols . Stars , planets , the tops of trees-everything was metaphor and message . He had already taken so much from her ; he did n't want to rob her of a home , too . <p> Nashville was where they were happiest . They were poor , but it did n't matter-they were intoxicated with hope , fueled with each other and the seamless dream your life becomes when you let yourself love . In their apartment , above a pawn shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drinking , smoking , meandering effortlessly into sex . There was something almost painfully satisfying about the depth of their physical connection-he knew when she wanted to take it slow , he knew when she wanted him to grip her hips so hard she 'd have bruises in the morning , soft amber and lavender reminders of lust and need . They were badges , something neither of them ever talked about . Sometimes , in the middle of the night , he would wake up to use the bathroom , and when he came back to bed , he would stand there , hover over her , and stare at her nearly motionless body , thinking , You 're a gift , you 're a gift . He shivered . How did you get here ? It does n't matter . The arrival , not the journey . <p> He could watch her for fifteen minutes , more . If the air conditioner was off , he heard the hiss of the neon signs in the windows below . He watched her softly rising and falling chest , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was she dreaming ? He did n't care . He did n't quite believe where he was , in this apartment in Tennessee full of love and little else , and he thought it might be he himself who was asleep . Graceland , the Opry , Elvis could walk right in and rhinestones could splash the walls and he would n't notice . Fat , sad Elvis , or the Army-trim one . Play them a concert , sing " Kentucky Rain " and " In the Ghetto . " <p> George occasionally worried , when he was n't with her , that she would disappear . That she was too good , that the two of them fit too well , for it to be real and lasting . The world is n't generous like that , he thought , there is no way this can continue without the smack of some tragedy . Other times , like when he saw her round the corner , or enter the caf where he was playing an open-mike night , he told himself he was being irrational , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be anxious about . " They have medication for this kind of thinking , " a friend of his told him one night when he confessed his anxiety . " My uncle 's a shrink , maybe I could get some for you . " Just then , Natalie walked into the bar , and George gestured at her coming toward them and said , " There 's my pill . " <p> No note . What could George possibly say ? There is no rationale , finally , and to leave a few sentences , a few pages even , would only make the hurt hurt more . He would rather leave her with memories , indelible , times they were unmarred and did n't need anything like an explanation . They themselves were an explanation . There were a hundred , more , but here is one : They are in a bar in Nashville . His set is ten minutes away , and he is nervous , far more nervous than usual , and the shots are n't helping like they should . ( Tequila , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) She knows he 's uneasy , because he ca n't maintain eye contact , and she pulls his stool close to her own . He is fingering a pick , passing it knuckle to knuckle in his right hand . She 's hypnotized for a second , it looks like a Jacob 's ladder . Their thighs are brushing . She beckons , with her hand , for him to lean in close . He does . She starts singing , quietly . She has a terrible voice for singing but it does n't matter , it is so far from mattering , it can never matter . He is staring at the liquor bottles lined up flawlessly against the mirror behind the bar . Soldiers in formation . It 's a Waylon Jennings song . " They ought to give me the Wurlitzer prize/All the silver I let slide down the slot/Playing those songs so blue / Help me remember you / I do n't want to get over you / I do n't want to get over you . " The bartenders pass in and out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't real , either . The woman on stage is wax , her strumming arm bionic . The street outside is another planet . There is no way to get there , and no need to . All we need is an island . The candles flicker . Cigarettes glow orange . Smoke kisses the ceiling . " A fresh roll of quarters/Same old songs/Missin ' you through and through . " I do n't want to get over you , I do n't want to get over you . <p> Her life , she thought , had transformed into pure aftermath . Natalie remembered other times , precise events and people and places , but they did n't seem hers . She no longer felt like she owned them , as if they had happened to a different person . Why ca n't the rape be like that , she wondered , why is it that everything except the assault belongs to someone else ? Why does violence tattoo you , and joy does n't ? Still , she knew it was early-only seven months-to expect to feel significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintain at least semi-regular contact with friends and family . She knew that both of these things were important , and she tried to draw some consolation in them . She never phoned the counselor . <p> George . What frightened her most was that she would never again feel comfortable being touched by him . She tried , desperately , to recall him kissing her , the two of them entwined on a drowsy late morning , or at night , when they did n't need to talk , just needed each other-the imperative of desire . But she could n't , and she was amazed at how quickly all the nights they had spent together were scrapped . She scoured her journals and piles of old snapshots , looking for some spark of memory , irrefutable indications of love and want and need and happiness . <p> For a few weeks she spent hours every day on the Internet , tracking down former classmates she barely knew , hoping the reignited contact would bring her old life streaming back . A random , unpredictable anecdote from college to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mailed enthusiastically for several days , then let the contact dissolve . Because it was n't working , and she felt slightly guilty : She did n't care where they were living , what impressive job titles they held , who their husbands were , whether they planned on being at the upcoming five-year reunion . She did n't care if they had dogs or children or both or neither . It was n't their fault , but she wanted something they could n't give her . <p> The detectives never found him . He never had a name . They interviewed Natalie three separate times , had her meet with a sketch artist , even though she saw his face only fleetingly . There were no witnesses , and the crime did n't match any recent sprees . <p> " These people tend to fade in and out of society . They 're really fringe people , " the detectives told her . " He 'll probably surface again at some point and try something like this again , and that 's when we 'll get him . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uneducated . " This was supposed to reassure her . She sensed resignation in the detectives ' voices , and she recalled a statistic she had read : If they 're not caught within seventy-two hours of their crimes , most criminals are never arrested for what they did . <p> She did n't blame the police . She did n't blame anyone , except for her attacker . Maybe if they had apprehended him , she would have begun to feel better . But she doubted it . It was n't fear that she felt most acutely , some panic that she would be a victim again ; it was more a dull , persistent pain , along with the perpetual agony of both craving and refusing physical contact . What if her fate was to never be held again ? <p> George was surprised how familiar Nashville seemed . It was a cloudy day when his plane touched down , and he spent most of it driving around their old street , past their apartment , the movie theater where they wasted rainy afternoons , the diners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cafs where he had played a few times , saw that they still had weekly open-mike nights . He peered in the plate-glass windows but did n't recognize any of the waitresses . They had become friends with one , Karen , and she let them stay long past closing time , joining them for drinks while the bartenders cashed out and the busboys mopped the floor . <p> He had expected to be flooded with doubt , hooks that would pull him back to the airport and back on to a plane . Not necessarily back to San Francisco but another city , any city , where there was light and air and no history . Taxis streamed by him , tour buses on their way to Music Row and megaphoned narration . The passengers were pressed to the windows , weighed down with cameras and guidebooks and bottled water . <p> He found the neighborhood : Buena Vista . It was the part of Nashville where you were n't supposed to go , the streets littered with abandoned houses and drug dens . It seemed like an entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countrymusic mecca just several miles away . On the corners stood liquor stores , cashiers shielded behind thick glass partitions . Many of the houses , the ones where people were still sentenced to live , had bars on the windows . <p> Once it was dark , George started his search in earnest , taking random turns , losing himself deeper and deeper in the labyrinthine blocks . He lingered by a playground , watching the remnants of a pickup basketball game , and an older man passed him and hissed , " You in the wrong neighborhood , son . Best be getting the fuck out . " George shook his head , mostly to himself , and unthreaded his fingers from the fence he had been gazing through . He kept walking , slowly , scanning for people . <p> An hour later he knew it was about to happen . He had strolled by an all-night grocery store , where a pack of young men was smoking and drinking from liquor bottles sleeved in brown paper bags . Three of them started following him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzed but gave off no brightness-somewhere they were likely to think they would n't get caught . <p> When he heard the quickening of their steps behind him , he braced himself . One of them poked his shoulder and said , " Okay , man , gim me your wallet and your watch . " <p> George turned around to face them . Two tall ones , and another a few inches shorter than him , flashing a gold tooth . He was the spokesman of the group . A tattoo of a snake curled up his forearm . <p> " No , " said George . <p> " What ? " said Gold Tooth , suddenly erasing the space between them . <p> " I said no , " George repeated . " Something wrong with your hearing ? " <p> Gold Tooth started laughing , a sinister , prescient laugh , and turned away from George to face his friends . " You believe this motherfucker ? " Then he locked his hand around George 's throat and dropped him to the ground in a single , crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers still tight around his neck . " My hearing 's fine . Now you gon na give it up ? " <p> Twisting and gasping for air , George said , " Fuck you . " The back of his head was already beginning to throb from where it had hit the pavement . <p> Laughter again . George realized why he was the leader of the group : There was genuine cruelty and sadism in him . <p> " Really ? " he asked . " You sure that 's the answer you want to be sticking with ? You sure you do n't want to choose answer B ? " <p> George nodded . <p> " Answer B , man , that 's usually the more popular answer . Nine times out of ten , skinny-ass white motherfuckers like yourself go with answer B. B-for bawling like a baby . " <p> " Fuck you , " George managed again . <p> " Okay , " Gold Tooth said calmly . " Time to pay . " <p> The two others rushed up and started rifling through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold Tooth kept one hand clamped around his throat and ripped his watch off his wrist with the other . <p> Then they started kicking and punching him , burying their unlaced boots in his ribs and knees and hips . The blows came swift , one after another , and George heard his bones snap , felt the strange cool warmth of newly released blood . He knew it was flowing from his nose , around his eyes , other places as well . He heard them laughing , too , and he wondered if they had any idea they were giving him exactly what he deserved . <p> Author Affiliation
