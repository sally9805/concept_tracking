William McKinley , Ohioan // It is generally believed by strangers that the most interesting and significant part of Ohio 's history lies in the part the state has played in national politics-as a " barometer " state and as the home of political leaders . Ohio has produced many men of political importance , and has sent seven native sons to the presidency-Grant , Garfield , Hayes , Benjamin Harrison , McKinley , Taft and Harding . However , Ohio 's industrial life overshadows its politics .... Ohio 's major importance-and major interest-lies in a large and varied industrialism. - The Ohio Guide ( WPA ) // William McKinley was born in Ohio in 1843 , mostly educated there , fought the Civil War in a Buckeye regiment , represented an Ohio district in Congress , and sat in the governor 's chair in Columbus . He loved the state . His God , loved even more , was the benign God of an Ohio Methodist Sunday School . His career is only understandable as the career of a proud and well-connected middle-class Ohioan . Factory whistles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Republic , and Civil War recollections his Herodotus. // Nineteenth-century Ohio , however , was not just a place but a phenomenon . No retrospective on America 's twenty-fifth president can begin without a comprehension of the state 's spectacular emergence as a center of U.S. political and economic gravity during the fifty-eight years between McKinley 's birth and death . Like Virginia earlier , Ohio became a " Mother of Presidents . " It was also the first crucible of the Old Northwest . In the year McKinley was born , four other future GOP presidents called Ohio home-Ulysses Grant , just out of West Point , Rutherford Hayes , a year past his Kenyon College graduation , the twelve-year-old James Garfield , working to support his widowed mother , and Benjamin Harrison , a schoolboy in North Bend . // None , obviously , had any youthful inkling of the Ohio regime to come , of how from 1868 to 1900 , no Republican would be elected president who was not born in the Buckeye State . Those of other origins tried in vain : New Yorkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three leading Northern generals in the Civil War were Ohio-born : Grant , William Tecumseh Sherman , and Philip Sheridan . Ohio itself was the sole Northern state central enough to be a bridge from the war 's eastern theater of operations in next-door Virginia to its western theater spanning the Ohio-Mississippi river system . The late nineteenth century was Ohio 's great period , the Buckeye hour in history . // This unique molding and mentoring helped to sculpt McKinley 's political rise and influence . The state 's economic vigor and innovation , besides underpinning its national importance , also gave McKinley his principal career theme : first , the blessings of a protective tariff system , and then the reforms it would need to meet the twentieth century . Lacking the patina that other Ohio GOP presidents got at Williams College ( Garfield ) , Yale ( Taft ) , or Harvard Law School ( Hayes ) , little about McKinley did not reflect his middle class , midcountry origins . // DRUMS TO DYNAMOS ALONG THE OHIO // At the beginning of the nineteenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , rich land closest to Virginia and the original Northern states . Steamboats were common on the Ohio River by the 1820s . By 1830 and 1840 , the center of national population was speeding westward across Virginia . In 1850 it hovered near Parkersburg , West Virginia , on the south bank of the Ohio River . Then , like Eliza , the fugitive slave in Harriet Beecher Stowe 's Uncle Tom 's Cabin , it leaped across the river , coming to rest in 1860 about fifteen miles from Chillicothe. // Ohio had gone from territory to state in 1803 , just as Thomas Jefferson was arranging the Louisiana Purchase . The early settlers , disproportionately from Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Kentucky , concentrated near the river that had taken most of them west . Cincinnati , its " Queen City , " became the state 's major urban and commercial center , although its streets were often clogged by noisy , dirty hogs on their way to the slaughterhouses. // Then in the 1830s , courtesy of New York 's Erie Canal , a new population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state with Yankees , Pennsylvanians , New Yorkers , and German , British , and Irish immigrants . At mid-century , Cincinnati still had a huge edge over Yankee Cleveland on Lake Erie-a population of some 115,000 versus just 17,000 . But growth in northern Ohio was accelerating like one of the new Philadelphia-built locomotives on the Mad River and Lake Erie Railway . // Ohio was a new type of state , a composition board of converging migrations from all three major U.S. eighteenth-century coastal regions-New England , the Middle Atlantic ( mostly Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers ) , and the South ( principally Virginians , Carolinians , and migrants from Tennessee and Kentucky ) . Ohio 's northeast , the former Western Reserve of Connecticut , had welcomed a small first wave of Yankee settlers in the 1780s and 1790s at the same time as larger numbers of Appalachian Scots-Irish crossed the Pennsylvania and Virginia borders . // As settlement swelled , Ohio 's population jumped from 230,000 in 1810-Shawnee and Wyandot war parties still prowled the state 's northwest-to some 900,000 in 1830 . A further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1850 . Ohio became to the canal , steamboat , and Conestoga wagon era what California would be to the automobile and airplane in the decades after World War II : not just a beacon but a national symbol of westward migration . // " The immigration to the North Central section , " concluded historian Frederick Jackson Turner , " had a special significance . In the Atlantic states , from the colonial days , the rule of the older stock was well-established , and institutions , manners and customs-the cultural life of the sections-had been largely fixed by tradition . But in the New West , society was plastic and democratic . All elements were suddenly coming in , together , to form the section . It would be a mistake to think that social classes and distinctions were obliterated , but in general , no such stratification existed as was to be found , especially , in New England . " ' // Buckeye agriculture complemented Jacksonian democracy , being small-holder based and a far cry from plantations of the Cot ton South or the quasi-feudal land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lured by the fifty to sixty bushels an acre corn yields of the fertile Muskingum , Scioto , and Miami valleys , two or three times what they could grow on hillside or tidewater plots back east . By the 1840s , two extensive state-built waterways connected Ohio farmlands to Lake Erie and the Erie Canal , opening up the Eastern U.S. and European corn and wheat markets . Higher crop prices followed . // Additional help came from the reaper and other new farm machinery . In 1840 , Ohio was the leading wheat-producing state ranked by yield . This slipped to second in 1850 and fourth in 1860 as the grain belt moved west . In corn , however , Ohio had been fourth in 1840 , but rose to first place in 1850 . Corn was marketed largely on the hoof-cattle and hogs fed on it , then were slaughtered , packed , and sent east or abroad . // Not surprisingly , Ohio led the nation in livestock in 1850 . Meat-packing Cincinnati had already won the nickname " Porkopolis , " and Ohio 's sheep-raising eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A century later , one would err taking Ohio as the heart of the Farm Belt , but not in the years of McKinley 's boyhood . // Biblical land of Goshen as the state might seem , abundant crops did not always lead to prosperity . That had been proved in the late 1830s and 1840s when banks failed and low meat and grain prices barely exceeded production costs . Prosperity returned in the 1 850s , but by the late sixties and early seventies , Washington 's acquiescence in a post-Civil War contraction of the currency was provoking crop and livestock districts alike . // As president , McKinley would fondly reminisce about how as a barefoot nine-year-old , he took his family 's cows to and from pasture . Yet from the start , his part of Ohio was also industrial . At the time of McKinley 's birth , the Niles Tribune-Chronicle later recalled , the town had included " 3 churches , 3 stores , 1 blast furnace , rolling mill , nail factory forge and about 300 inhabitants . " Even in 1820 , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured goods , and this kind of interspersed small-scale industry characterized the Ohio countryside until the Civil War . // McKinley 's grandfather James , and his father , William , were iron makers by trade . In the early nineteenth century , they came to Ohio from Pennsylvania , where Scots-Irish iron masters , aroused by prohibitions in the British Iron Act of 1750 against colonials making pig iron into ironware and machinery , had been a mainstay of the American Revolution . In 1804 , Daniel Heaton built Ohio 's first smelting furnace on Yellow Creek , near the present site of Youngstown . This was the forerunner of the Mahoning Valley steel industry , at its twentieth-century peak second only to that of nearby Pittsburgh . // Iron quickly became Ohio 's leading manufacturing industry , with the 1850 census ranking state pig-iron output second only to Pennsylvania 's . Coal and iron production both concentrated in the eastern counties where the McKinleys always had a small furnace or two . // Turnpikes , canals , and railroads crisscrossed the area where McKinley grew up . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered on Boston , New York , and Philadelphia . At the Civil War 's outbreak , Ohio led the nation in railroad mileage , and when Buckeye soldiers got leave , all they had to do was reach the Baltimore &amp; Ohio line in the east or the Louisville &amp; Cincinnati in the west . Home would be only hours away . // Like Ohio 's centrality in late-nineteenth-century politics , its significance to U.S. manufacturing is hard to exaggerate . Between young Will McKinley 's birth and his election to the presidency in 1896 , the state 's industrial innovation was the stuff of record books-literally. // Cleveland had John D. Rockefeller at work in the Ohio oilfields and refinery district , as well as Charles Brush , whose invention of the arc light illuminated America 's cities . Young Thomas A. Edison spent some of his boyhood puttering in the town of Milan . Charles Martin Hall , based in Oberlin , in 1886 discovered the electrolytic process for making aluminum . Toledo to the northwest claimed Edward Libbey and Michael Owens , whose inventions and local company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
