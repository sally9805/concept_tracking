<p> Shortly after Monitor contributor Sander Thoenes was killed in East Timor last year , it seemed as if justice would be served in his case . But that looks increasingly in doubt . Initial reports suggested that those responsible for the killing were members of the Indonesian Army 's Battalion 745 , a unit based in East Timor . On Sept. 21 , 1999 , the day Thoenes was shot to death , many of the battalion 's soldiers rode in a convoy toward Dili , East Timor 's capital , where witnesses say the soldiers encountered the Dutch journalist . Indonesia was withdrawing its military because East Timorese voters , in a referendum organized by the UN on Aug. 30 , had voted overwhelmingly for independence after nearly a quarter century of Indonesian occupation . A Monitor investigation published early this year linked the battalion to 13 murders or disappearances on that day alone , including Thoenes 's . An investigation by an Australian coroner and an inquiry jointly conducted by a Dutch detective and an Australian military policeman , both reached the preliminary conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battalion 's commander , Lt. Col. Jacob Sarosa , has insisted to Indonesian officials and other interlocutors that his unit was not involved in Thoenes 's death , and his word has carried the day . So 15 months on , the chances that Thoenes 's killers will be brought to justice are sinking fast under the weight of international indifference and Indonesia 's increasingly nationalistic political climate . " As far as I am aware , " says Peter Thoenes , Sander 's brother , " there has been no activity on the Indonesian side on Sander 's case at all in the year 2000 . " Peter Thoenes says he still has some faith in Indonesian Attorney General Marzuki Darusman because " he seems sincere . " But Mr. Marzuki says his investigation has " stalled because of a lack of leads . " Though Marzuki designated the Thoenes murder as one of his five priority East Timor cases at the beginning of the year , he has not yet named any suspects . " This is proving much more difficult than we expected , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of opposition from military hardliners and populist politicians such as Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri . " Anything that can keep the pressure on will be well taken ... so that our investigation does n't fizzle as a result of lack of concern , " he says . Marzuki hopes to prosecute 22 suspects in connection with four other cases of human rights abuses in East Timor by the end of February , though he 's worried that Indonesia 's parliament could simply veto the whole process . A country 's struggles But as Thoenes 's friends and family worry that the small solace justice could provide will not be theirs , Indonesia is bearing a heavier cost . Thoenes 's murder occurred in the context of the country 's struggles with a military accustomed to an atmosphere of impunity . Indonesia 's military and police have routinely used torture and summary executions , and human rights investigators say tens of thousands have been murdered in recent decades . UN and Indonesian investigators say Battalion 745 's behavior fit a pattern of rights abuses by Indonesian troops intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 referendum . More than 1,000 people were killed and 250,000 driven from their homes before an Australian-led multinational force arrived on Sept. 20 and the last Indonesian soldier left shortly thereafter . Mohammed Othman , the chief prosecutor for the UN Transitional Authority in East Timor ( UNTAET ) , which is now administering the territory , is leading a separate effort to achieve some sort of accountability . Earlier this month , he indicted 10 men from a militia called Team Alpha on charges related to the massacre of nuns , priests , aid workers , and an Indonesian journalist on Sept. 25 last year . Team Alpha was created and trained by the Indonesian Special Forces , known by its Indonesian acronym , Kopassus , and worked closely with Battalion 745 at its headquarters in Los Palos , East Timor . Kopassus officers dominated Indonesian military policy in East Timor , and were often the controlling figures in battalions deployed in the territory . Nine of the 10 suspects - all East Timorese - are in custody , and Mr. Othman says he hopes to convince some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter sentences . " We are n't just focusing on this matter as a separate event but are trying to link it up with the whole conduct of 745 on their route from Los Palos to Dili , " Othman says . " We do n't have enough evidence yet to pinpoint individuals , but we can say that the conduct of that battalion was criminal . " Othman , a Tanzanian who was formerly chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , says he does n't have enough evidence to charge anyone with Thoenes 's death . But he adds the Battalion 745 convoy arrived at Dili headquarters 20 minutes after Thoenes 's death , and that its route was through the area where the reporter died . " It 's quite clear that nobody else could have killed Thoenes . The area was deserted then , other than the military , and the military had full control there , " Othman says . Pressure against trial Of course , even if Othman builds a case , it 's not likely he alone will be able to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Timor are currently in Indonesia , and the military 's lawyers have made it clear they will fight extradition efforts as a matter of national sovereignty . " We want trials , but the trials must be held in Indonesia , " says Adnan Buyung Nasution , chairman of the military 's legal team , which calls itself the Human Rights Advocacy Team for Indonesian military and police . " This is a very basic matter of principle : It is a matter of national interest to protect our citizens . " Injustice to the nation Indonesians , by and large , have been indifferent to the crimes in East Timor , seeing them as a footnote to an injustice they themselves have suffered . Many Indonesians see the loss of their onetime province as a humiliation engineered by foreign powers , and say the violence there was the result of a civil war . Asmara Nababan , chairman of the Indonesian Commission on Human Rights , says he is " growing pessimistic " that a fair trial will ever be held . " The parliament does n't understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A third avenue for justice - a UN human rights tribunal - seems to be growing ever more unlikely . Indonesian officials say they expect that China and Russia will stop any move in the UN Security Council to create such a tribunal . Both countries have been accused of abusing human rights in rebellious provinces of their own - Tibet and Xinjiang , in China 's case , and Chechnya , in Russia 's - and would thus have reason to stop any international inquiry into Indonesia 's actions in East Timor . UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan signaled as much when he ignored a recommendation from Mary Robinson , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , early this year calling for a tribunal . It was the first time such a recommendation has ever been rebuked . Instead , Mr. Annan said the UN preferred that Indonesia carry out its own trials first , and that a tribunal could still be created if the UN is n't satisfied with the results . But Nasution , the military 's chief lawyer , says that would make a mockery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tried and acquitted here , they ca n't try them again somewhere else . That 's double jeopardy .
