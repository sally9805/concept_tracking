On any given night , the members of OutKast can be found circling their hometown of Atlanta on Highway 285 , writing songs while the rest of the city sleeps . Andre " 3000 " ( Andre Benjamin ) will caress his giant seedpod of an Afro and hum melodies into a tape recorder while Big Boi ( Antwan Patton ) , his high school friend and rap partner of 11 years , chugs sweet tea and rhymes phrases into his cell phone 's digital voice bank . It makes for a pretty picture  --  best friends who struggled together , got famous together and stayed together  --  or rather , it would , if Andre and Big Boi were ever in the same car . <P> " They 've always been very different people , " says Andre 's mom , Sharon Benjamin Hodo . " You could start by saying Andre is the introvert and Big is the extrovert . " You could add that Andre is a lithe sex symbol who wears sequined pants , avoids drugs and worries about the state of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerseys , is a perpetual threat for High Times 's Man of the Year and famously introduced MTV 's Cribs to the stripper pole he installed in his living room . <P> For the past decade , though , Andre and Big Boi have fused their personalities to create the best songbook in hip-hop . Songs like B.O.B . ( Bombs over Baghdad ) and Rosa Parks not only push the boundaries of the genre , they stimulate massive butt and brain vibrations . But as both men approach 30 , their differences have hardened . Now they write songs separately , record in separate studios and sit for separate interviews . On Sept. 23 , they are releasing separate albums , albeit in one boxed set , under the OutKast name . ( Big Boi 's disc is called Speakerboxxx ; Andre 's is The Love Below . ) All this has led to rumors that OutKast is breaking up . " People got it all wrong , " says Andre . " It 's about growing up , not breaking up . " <P> Perhaps . But seconds later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of music . I 'm sick of it , man . When you 're in a group , you constantly have to compromise ... It 's real stressful . " Andre 's specific gripe is that he would like to make more-abstract music , like his hero , John Coltrane , but he believes that neither Big Boi nor his audience will tolerate it . There are other rifts as well . After his role in Hollywood Homicide , Andre wants to develop an acting career . And he refuses to tour . Instead , he would like to enroll at Oxford University . " I want to grow in ways I ca n't here , " he says . <P> An ordinary partner might well give Andre a one-way ticket to All Souls . But despite his gangsta image , Big Boi is remarkably patient and empathetic . In the old married couple that is OutKast , Andre may compromise his airy musical vision , but it is Big Boi who makes sacrifices on the ground . Speakerboxxx was completed in December , but Big Boi refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past several years , Big Boi has spent hours each day supervising OutKast 's business interests , allowing Andre the freedom to take yoga and saxophone lessons . All the while , Big Boi has never once indulged in the slightest public eye roll about his partner 's ambitions . " He wants to go to Europe or do movies , I 'm fine with it , " says Big Boi . " Our love for each other is greater than our love for music . We 're the coolest motherf on the planet . "
