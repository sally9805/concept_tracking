<p> Spoiling for a fight ? VH1 delivers a knockout , or maybe a sucker punch , with a five-part series guaranteed to kindle as much discord as harmony . <p> The Rolling Stones ' ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction tops the newly assembled 100 Greatest Songs of Rock &; Roll , a countdown special airing nightly at 10 p.m . ET/PT , Monday through Jan. 21 . The list was chosen by a 700-member panel that included songwriters , producers , radio DJs and such artists as Bono , Johnny Cash , Curtis Mayfield , Lou Reed , Bonnie Raitt and Art Garfunkel . Each voter was asked to submit a list of 50 favorite songs . In the resulting consensus , The Beatles lead with nine entries , followed by the Stones with five , and Elvis and Led Zeppelin with four each . Four Bob Dylan compositions also made the cut : three of his own recordings , plus the Jimi Hendrix Experience cover of All Along the Watchtower . <p> At 11 p.m . ET/PT Jan. 21 , immediately after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The List , with Meat Loaf supervising celebrity bickering to determine the greatest song of all time . <p> The series , featuring The Practice star Dylan McDermott as host , repeats from 3 to 8 p.m . ET/PT Jan. 22 and noon to 5 p.m . ET/PT Jan. 23 . A survey of the top 50 , plus a list of the songs ranking 51-100 : <p> 1 . The Rolling Stones , ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction . Keith Richards literally dreamed the chord progression of what in 1965 became the Stones ' first No. 1 hit in the USA . He woke up with the melody line and title chorus ringing in his head , and Mick Jagger filled in the blanks . After the band nixed Richards ' proposal to use a brash horn section , he compensated with a forceful opening guitar riff he says was inspired by Martha and The Vandellas ' Dancing in the Streets . Though Satisfaction is largely Richards ' creation , he did n't feel it was strong enough to be an A-side . Tinged with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mocking vocals , the song defined the Stones ' artistry and attitude . <p> 2 . Aretha Franklin , Respect . A soul-pop masterpiece that topped the charts in 1967 , Respect combines three R &B; forces : producer Jerry Wexler , songwriter Otis Redding ( who sang the original 1965 hit version ) and diva Aretha Franklin , who brings her gospel chops and fervor to the song 's defiant lyrics . Franklin and her sister Carolyn , who shaped the tune 's tempo , coined the " sock it to me " line that later became a catch phrase on Laugh-In . Recorded for Atlantic in late 1966 , Respect heralded a return to Franklin 's pew-rattling church performances . Though synonymous with feminism , Respect also served as a civil rights battle cry . <p> 3 . Led Zeppelin , Stairway to Heaven . Never issued as a single , this protracted slab of heavy-metal mysticism , which laboriously builds from ballad to screamer , remains a constant on rock radio . <p> 4 . Bob Dylan , Like a Rolling Stone . It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the clich&eacute; " Once upon a time , " but that is the magic of Dylan . The 1965 hit raised the bard 's profile as a poet and generational spokesman , but it was really his vocals that took this song into fresh territory . Though the lyrics and musical tone are acidic and angry , Dylan 's knowing nuances temper the bitterness and sarcasm with shades of mercy . <p> 5 . Bruce Springsteen , Born to Run . Youthful frustration trumps suburban ennui in this 1975 diary of a New Jersey dreamer . The song evolved on the road , though Springsteen envisioned it as a studio creation . He spent six months writing it . <p> 6 . The Eagles , Hotel California . Pretty yet haunting , the West Coast fable was recorded in Miami . It reached No. 1 in 1977 , to the surprise of the band and its label . <p> 7 . The Doors , Light My Fire . Incessant noodling and Jim Morrison 's seductive pleas stretched to seven minutes , prompting Elektra to demand a shorter version for radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 8 . The Beach Boys , Good Vibrations . An amazing pop symphony , Brian Wilson 's elaborate aural construction employed a cello and the odd electronic theremin , required 17 studio sessions and , at the time of its 1966 release , was the most complex and costliest single ever produced ( $ 16,000 ) . <p> 9 . The Beatles , Hey Jude . Their first record on their Apple label topped the Billboard chart for nine weeks in 1968 , despite a radio-unfriendly length of 7-plus minutes . The somber ballad was largely Paul McCartney 's doing , though songwriting partner John Lennon figured heavily in the lyrics . Paul visited John 's wife Cynthia soon after their marriage dissolved and was moved by son Julian Lennon 's plight . The original title was Hey Jules , but McCartney deemed Jude easier on the ears . Oddly , several people claimed to be the song 's subject , and even Lennon admitted he suspected the song was about him . <p> 10 . John Lennon , Imagine . A marvel of simplicity , this 1971 elegiac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated in art and life . <p> 11 . The Beatles , Yesterday . Penned with the working title Scrambled Eggs , Yesterday may be the proudest achievement of Paul McCartney , who sang it with a string quartet . <p> 12 . The Kingsmen , Louie Louie . This dumb rocker with indecipherable lyrics nearly collapses in shambles at every bar , yet it 's sturdy enough to withstand nearly four decades of countless radio replays and covers . Written by Richard Berry and released in 1963 , it gradually climbed to No. 2 . The cheap recording and the Portland , Ore. , band 's amateur musicianship ( including one of the goofiest guitar solos on record ) did n't hamper the appeal or influence of a song many deemed indecent . The lyrics , brilliantly garbled by singer Jack Ely , relate the story of a man pining for his home and girlfriend in Jamaica . Widespread misinterpretations caused the song to be banned by the governor of Indiana . The FCC and FBI eventually decreed the rumors meritless . <p> 13 . The Who , My Generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon at his bashing best , still packs a wallop , though it 's doubtful Pete Townshend currently embraces the line " Hope I die before I get old . " <p> 14 . Marvin Gaye , What 's Going On . Gaye 's relaxed vocal and poignant message against war and poverty raised the bar on black pop in 1971 , when this reached No. 2 . Two pro-football players sing backup vocals . <p> 15 . Chuck Berry , Johnny B. Goode . One of rock 's simplest and catchiest classics imprinted subsequent rock titans from the Beach Boys to Bruce Springsteen . The " country boy " named Johnny B. Goode was originally cast as a " colored boy , " but Berry feared the reference would alienate white fans . Since its release in 1958 , Berry 's galloping rocker with the rushed vocals and snappy guitar licks has been a primer for wannabe ax-slingers in garages across America . <p> 16 . Derek and The Dominos , Layla . Mellow but intense , with a stirring guitar coda by Duane Allman , the 1972 track was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison 's ex-wife . <p> 17 . The Who , Wo n't Get Fooled Again . The post-Tommy anthem bid adieu to rock-opera grandeur and reclaimed the quartet 's pile-driving rock formula . <p> 18 . Elvis Presley , Jailhouse Rock . Commissioned for Presley 's third film , the lively Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller tune spent seven weeks at No. 1 in 1957 , shortly before the King was drafted . <p> 19 . Don McLean , American Pie . Split in half to fit on a 45-rpm single , the 8-minute , 27-second opus on pop history focuses on Buddy Holly 's fatal plane crash as " the day the music died . " <p> 20 . The Beatles , A Day in the Life . One of The Beatles ' most ambitious tunes surveys news items from the death of Guinness heir Tara Browne to the number of potholes in Blackburn , Lancashire , before ending with a chilling 42-second piano chord . Banned by the BBC for suspected drug references . <p> 21 . James Brown , I Got You ( I Feel Good ) . Horn bleats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite hunting ground for modern rap samplers . <p> 22 . Stevie Wonder , Superstition . Wonder initially wrote Superstition for an abortive Jeff Beck Motown project , then reclaimed it for his own Talking Book album , with synthesizers supplanting guitars . He wanted to release Big Brother as the single , but the Motown brass felt certain Superstition would capture the masses . The song , with its jazzy tempo and laundry list of admonitions , went to No. 1 in 1972 and helped Wonder graduate from child prodigy to adult visionary . <p> 23 . The Beatles , I Want to Hold Your Hand . The Fab Four 's first No. 1 single on this side of the pond spawned Beatlemania with its energy , innocence and trademark Lennon/McCartney harmonies . <p> 24 . The Rolling Stones , Brown Sugar . Clinging to the Stones ' rep as the Fab Four 's scruffy and evil counterpart , many blasted the 1971 chart-topper as racist , sexist and even a coded promotion of Mexican brown heroin . It was the first record released with the Stones tongue logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendrix , Purple Haze . The 1967 song 's fuzz-tone guitar , monster drums and unmistakable drug allusions initially shocked city fathers but eventually found a permanent home on classic-rock radio . <p> 26 . The Rolling Stones , Sympathy for the Devil . Mick Jagger 's provocative , scathing rant , a cautionary narrative on evil , did little to assuage parental fears of Satanic infiltration . <p> 27 . Queen , Bohemian Rhapsody . The bombastic music and Freddie Mercury 's operatic bellow clicked with music hounds bored by gritty rock . <p> 28 . The Kinks , You Really Got Me . The British band 's lusty rock workout not only galvanized fans in 1964 but held up against Van Halen 's louder remake in 1978 . <p> 29 . Roy Orbison , Oh , Pretty Woman . Here 's another song co-opted by Van Halen . Orbison 's original boasts angelic vocals and a happy ending for a geek spying his attractive prey . <p> 30 . Simon and Garfunkel , Bridge Over Troubled Water . Paul Simon 's poignant composition about unconditional love and Art Garfunkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America 's songbook . <p> 31 . Elvis Presley , Hound Dog . Bandleader Johnny Otis ordered up the Leiber/Stoller gem for blues woman Big Mama Thornton , who scored an R &B; hit with it in 1953 . Presley was drawn to Hound Dog after hearing a lounge act perform it in Las Vegas . Unlike Thornton 's Delta-steeped account , the Elvis interpretation is humorous , lively and sweaty . He introduced it live on Milton Berle 's TV show , and his hip-wiggling display , deemed lewd by viewers , drew nationwide protests . In a more benign performance , he sang it to a basset hound on Steve Allen 's show . Produced by Chet Atkins , the song was No. 1 for 11 weeks in 1956 . <p> 32 . The Beatles , Let It Be . Recorded while The Beatles were squabbling and on the brink of splitting , the soothing ballad was inspired by McCartney 's mother , who died of breast cancer in 1956 . <p> 33 . Otis Redding , ( Sittin ' on ) The Dock of the Bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memphis , three days before his private plane crashed in Wisconsin . The posthumous release was No. 1 for four weeks in 1968 and brought the national recognition and fame he failed to achieve in his lifetime . With input from guitarist Steve Cropper , Redding composed the only hit of his career on a houseboat in Sausa- lito , Calif . The process of mixing the track entailed heated debate about the level of seagull chatter in the background . <p> 34 . The Jimi Hendrix Experience , All Along The Watchtower . Perhaps the only interpretation of a Bob Dylan composition that eclipses the original . Hendrix makes the song his own , smothering the lines with psychedelic guitar stunts and capping the cryptic lyrics with a menacing howl . <p> 35 . Aerosmith , Walk This Way . Written by Steve Tyler and Joe Perry , the 1977 tune was an impressive blues-rock exercise , though it was considerably upgraded in a collaboration with hip-hop duo Run-DMC in 1986 . <p> 36 . The Temptations , My Girl . Syrupy lyrics are redeemed by David Ruffin 's convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 37 . Bill Haley and His Comets , ( We 're Gon na ) Rock Around the Clock . Haley 's rave-up , widely considered rock ' n ' roll 's opening volley , hijacked the nation 's youth in 1955 . The song , composed by Max Freedman and Jimmy DeKnight , was n't the era 's first rocker , nor the best , but it swept the rebel sound into the public consciousness . After stints as a yodeler and disc jockey , Haley formed the Comets ( originally The Saddlemen ) and released Rock Around the Clock in 1954 . The song , the oldest on VH1 's list , did n't hit until MGM plopped it into the opening credits of The Blackboard Jungle . Fans went berserk in movie theaters , prompting the song 's rerelease in 1955 . <p> 38 . Marvin Gaye , I Heard It Through the Grapevine.An elegant vocal and gospelized piano sweeten the universal theme of romantic paranoia . <p> 39 . Creedence Clearwater Revival , Proud Mary . The choogling swamp-rock hit had listeners assuming the Bay Area band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steppenwolf , Born to Be Wild . While the biker theme 's gnashing tone seems tame and dated in the ' 90s , it still gets props for popularizing the term " heavy metal . " <p> 41 . Nirvana , Smells Like Teen Spirit . The only ' 90s tune on this list ushered in the grunge revolution and remains one of the decade 's most potent and cathartic Gen-X tirades . <p> 42 . The Police , Every Breath You Take . Anxiety percolates through the cool detachment in Sting 's voice on this lovely , if unsettling , tune about obsession . <p> 43 . Ray Charles , What 'd I Say . Ray and his Raelettes boogie hard in a rhythmic and amusing gospel-based groove . <p> 44 . Lynyrd Skynyrd , Free Bird . Though the star-crossed Florida band delivered worthier contributions , this plodding jam , their third songwriting attempt , is both revered and reviled as a Southern-fried classic . <p> 45 . Buddy Holly and The Crickets , That 'll Be the Day . This tune by the Lubbock , Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodies all of Buddy Holly 's influences , from country to R &B; to Tex-Mex . Like his geeky horn-rimmed glasses , Holly 's vocal hiccups became an instantly recognizable facet of a legacy constructed over a mere three years . His frisky but sophisticated compositions , plus his maverick status as a self-contained musical assembly line , shaped rock , pop and country for decades . He died at 22 when his plane , also carrying Ritchie Valens and J.P . " The Big Bopper " Richardson , crashed in a heavy snowstorm in Iowa . <p> 46 . Led Zeppelin , Whole Lotta Love . Jackhammer drums , cheesy sound effects and Robert Plant 's feral panting yielded a radio perennial . <p> 47 . Aerosmith , Dream On . The Boston rock band , often chided as a third-rate Rolling Stones , advanced on the credibility scale with this artful balance of swoon and crunch . <p> 48 . The Righteous Brothers , You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feeling . Produced by Phil Spector , who wrote it with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil , the morose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 49 . Van Morrison , Brown Eyed Girl . Considering the brooding Irish singer 's penchant for pessimism , this was an unexpected pleasure of upbeat vocals , hand claps and carbonated pop melody . Lust and innocence commingle in a sunny reminiscence . <p> 50 . The Troggs , Wild Thing . It 's a silly , hopelessly out-of-date novelty that still makes you crank up the volume . <p> 51 . Crosby , Stills &; Nash , Suite : Judy Blue Eyes <p> 52 . Michael Jackson , Beat It <p> 53 . Jerry Lee Lewis , Great Balls of Fire <p> 54 . Bee Gees , Stayin ' Alive <p> 55 . The Buffalo Springfield , For What It 's Worth ( Stop , Hey What 's That Sound ) <p> 56 . Bob Dylan , Blowin ' in the Wind <p> 57 . The Beatles , Twist and Shout <p> 58 . Billy Joel , Piano Man <p> 59 . The Beatles , She Loves You <p> 60 . David Bowie , Space Oddity <p> 61 . The Beatles , Strawberry Fields Forever <p> 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crazy <p> 64 .
