Formation // I adored my father when I was a little girl . I would eagerly watch for him from a window and run down the street to meet him on his way home after work . With his encouragement and coaching , I played baseball , football and basketball . I tried to bring home good grades to win his approval . // - Living History // Hillary Rodham ? s childhood was not the suburban idyll suggested by the shaded front porch and gently sloping lawn of what was once the family home at 235 Wisner Street in Park Ridge , Illinois . In this leafy environment of postwar promise and prosperity , the Rodhams were distinctly a family of odd ducks , isolated from their neighbors by the difficult character of her father , Hugh Rodham , a sour , unfulfilled man whose children suffered his relentless , demeaning sarcasm and misanthropic inclination , endured his embarrassing parsimony , and silently accepted his humiliation and verbal abuse of their mother . // Yet as harsh , provocative , and abusive as Rodham was , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children a pervasive sense of family and love for one another that in Hillary ? s case is of singular importance . When Bill Clinton and Hillary honeymooned in Acapulco in 1975 , her parents and her two brothers , Hughie ( Hugh Jr. ) and Tony , stayed in the same hotel as the bride and groom . // Dorothy and Hugh Rodham , despite the debilitating pathology and undertow of tension in their marriage ( discerned readily by visitors to their home ) , were assertive parents who , at mid-century , intended to convey to their children an inheritance secured by old-fashioned values and verities . They believed ( and preached , in their different traditions ) that with discipline , hard work , encouragement ( often delivered in an unconventional manner ) , and enough education at home , school , and church , a child could pursue almost any dream . In the case of their only daughter , Hillary Diane , born October 26 , 1947 , this would pay enormous dividends , sending her into the world beyond Park Ridge with a steadiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it came at a price : Hugh imposed a patriarchal unpleasantness and ritual authoritarianism on his household , mitigated only by the distinctly modern notion that Hillary would not be limited in opportunity or skills by the fact that she was a girl . // Hugh Rodham , the son of Welsh immigrants , was sullen , tight-fisted , contrarian , and given to exaggeration about his own accomplishments . Appearances of a sort were important to him : he always drove a new Lincoln or Cadillac . But he wouldn ? t hesitate to spit tobacco juice through an open window . He chewed his cud habitually , voted a straight Republican ticket , and was infuriatingly slow to praise his children . " He was rougher than a corncob and gruff as could be , " an acquaintance once said . Nurturance and praise were left largely to his wife , whose intelligence and abilities he mocked and whose gentler nature he often trampled . " Don ? t let the doorknob hit you in the ass on your way out , " he frequently said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten to leave . She never left , but some friends and relatives were perplexed at Dorothy ? s decision to stay married when her husband ? s abuse seemed so unbearable . // " She would never say , That ? s it . I ? ve had it , " said Betsy Ebeling , * Hillary ? s closest childhood friend , who witnessed many contentious scenes at the Rodham dinner table . Sometimes the doorknob remark would break the tension and everybody would laugh . But not always . By the time Hillary had reached her teens , her father seemed defined by his mean edges-he had almost no recognizable enthusiasms or pretense to lightness as he descended into continuous bullying , ill-humor , complaint , and dejection . // In fact , depression seemed to haunt the Rodham men . Hugh ? s younger brother , Russell , a physician , was the " golden boy " of the three children of Hannah and Hugh Rodham Sr. of Scranton , Pennsylvania . When Russell sank into depression in 1948 , his parents asked Hugh to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell tried to hang himself in the attic , and Hugh had to cut him down . Afterward , Russell went to Chicago to stay with Hugh , Dorothy , and their baby daughter in their already overcrowded one-bedroom apartment . For months , Russell received psychiatric treatment at the local Veterans Administration hospital . Eventually he moved to a dilapidated walk-up in downtown Chicago , worked as a bartender , and declined into alcoholism and deeper depression until he died , in 1962 , in a fire that was caused by a lit cigarette . Hillary deeply felt her father ? s pain over the tragedy , she wrote . // Hugh ? s older brother , Willard , regarded as the most gregarious and fun-loving of the three , never left home or married , and was employed in a patronage job for the Scranton public works department . He resolved after his mother ? s death to take care of his father . He dedicated himself completely to the task for the next thirteen years , and when his father died at age eighty-six in 1965 , Willard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a coronary thrombosis , according to the coroner ? s report , though Hillary ? s brother Tony said , " He died of loneliness . When my grandfather died , Uncle Willard was lost . " // Hugh Rodham , himself broken of spirit , his brothers and parents dead , soon thereafter shut his business and retired . Not yet fifty-five , he continued to withdraw . Later , both of Hillary ? s brothers , to varying degrees , seemed to push through adulthood in a fog of melancholia. // In 1993 , after Hillary ? s law partner , close friend , and deputy White House counsel Vince Foster committed suicide , she approached William Styron , who had chronicled his own struggles with depression in his acclaimed book Darkness Visible . The conversation was not only about Foster ? s suicide , but also touched on the depression that seemed to afflict members of Hillary ? s family . // Hillary ? s mother , a resilient woman whose early childhood was a horror of abandonment and cruelty , was able to overcome adversity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dating Hugh Rodham-during which time she worked as his secretary and suspected he was continuing a relationship with another woman-before she agreed to marry him , according to family members . She and Hugh waited another five years to have their first child . ( Chelsea Clinton , too , was born in the fifth year of her parents ? marriage. ) // As intellectually broad-minded as her husband was incurious and uninterested , as inclined to reflection as he was to outburst , she fulfilled her lifelong goal of attending college in her late sixties ( majoring in psychology ) , after she and her husband moved to Little Rock in 1987 to be near their daughter and grandchild . Constantly evolving and changing ( like her daughter ) , she managed almost invariably to find a focus for her energy and satisfaction despite the dissonance of a difficult life at home . As her husband descended , she even became something of a free spirit , at turns sentimental , analytical , spiritual , and adventurous . ( Her favorite movies were not those of her childhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Australian drag queen romp-and the bloody classic Pulp Fiction . ) Dorothy taught classes at Sunday school ( as would her daughter ) ; Hugh didn ? t go to church on Sundays , saying he ? d rather pray at home . // Life in the Rodham household resembled a kind of boot camp , presided over by a belittling , impossible-to-satisfy drill instructor . During World War II , as a chief petty officer in the Navy , Rodham had trained young recruits in the U.S. military ? s Gene Tunney Program , a rigorous phys-ed regime based on the champion boxer ? s training and self-defense techniques , and on the traditional skills of a drill sergeant . After the war , in which Hugh had been spared overseas duty and was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Station because of a bad knee , he replicated the barracks experience in his own home , commanding loudly from his living room lounge chair ( from which he rarely rose , except for dinner ) , barking orders , denigrating , minimizing achievements , ignoring accomplishments , raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he called it . // His control over the household was meant to be absolute ; confronted with resistance , he turned fierce . If Hillary or one of her brothers had left the cap off a toothpaste tube , he threw it out the bathroom window and told the offending child to fetch it from the front yard evergreens , even in snow . Regardless of how windy and cold the Chicago winter night , he insisted when the family went to bed that the heat be turned off until morning . At dinner , he growled his opinions , indulged few challenges to his provocations , and rarely acknowledged the possibility of being proved wrong . Still , Hillary would argue back if the subject was substantive and she thought she was right . If Dorothy attempted to bring a conflicting set of facts into the discussion , she was typically ridiculed by her husband : " How would you know ? " " Where did you ever come up with such a stupid idea ? " " Miss Smarty Pants . " // " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . said . Decades later , Hillary and her brothers suggested this was part of a grander scheme to ensure that his children were " competitive , scrappy fighters , " to " empower " them , to foster " pragmatic competitiveness " without putting them down , to induce elements of " realism " into the privileged lifestyle of Park Ridge . Her father would tepidly acknowledge her good work , but tell her she could do better , Hillary said . But there is little to suggest that she or her brothers interpreted such encouragement so benignly at the time . When Hillary came home with all As except for one B on her report card , her father suggested that perhaps her school was too easy , and wondered half-seriously why she hadn ? t gotten straight As . Hillary tried mightily to extract some unequivocal declaration of approval from her father , but he had tremendous difficulty in expressing pride or affection . // At the dinner table , Betsy Ebeling recalled , " Hillary ? s mom would have cooked something good , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glove on the table , and he would always say something the opposite of what I thought he really believed-because it was so completely provocative and outrageous . It was just his way . He was opinionated , and he could be loud , and what better place to be that way than in his own home ? " // Unleashed , his rage was frightening , and the household sometimes seemed on the verge of imploding . Betsy and the few other girlfriends whom Hillary brought home could see that life with Hugh Rodham was painfully demeaning for her mother , and that Hillary winced at her father ? s distemper and chafed under his miserliness . Money was always a contentious issue , ultimately the way in which he could exercise undisputed control , especially in response to Hillary ? s and Dorothy ? s instinctive rebelliousness and the wicked sense of humor they shared . // Sometimes his tirades would begin in the kitchen and continue into her parents ? bedroom . Hillary would put her hands over her ears . But the experience of standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that honed Hillary and Bill Clinton ? s marital partnership , and helped inure her in the arena of political combat . // " I could go home to two parents who adored everything I did , " said Betsy . " Hillary had a different kind of love ; you had to earn it . " // * Ebeling is Betsy ? s married name . Her maiden name was Johnson . //
