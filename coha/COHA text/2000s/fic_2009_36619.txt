The night I went to the St. Regis hotel and accidentally crashed the birthday party of the Princess of Spain was the same night I was crowned superintendent of 287 West 12th Street . Both events took me completely by surprise and both led me to Gregory the exterminator , who wound up saving me in ways I did n't even know I needed to be saved . ( I do n't mean saved in a Jesus way . This is not a Jesus-saving kind of story . ) <br> To be honest , I was not even aware that Spain still had a princess until I was standing under the chandeliers in the hotel 's Cavendish Room with my mouth stuffed full of her free tapas . I thought modern royalty was the purview of the British  --  Charles , Harry , William , tragically dead Di  --  something to keep the international tabloid business afloat . And I certainly did n't know I was at a birthday party . My black silk Ann Taylor sheath with cracked rhinestone brooches on the shoulder straps , a fifteen-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be employed in a way that would infringe upon a personally meaningful event : birthday parties , like wedding receptions , were off-limits under a set of hastily conceived crashing criteria . Tag and I had agreed upon this moral distinction a year ago , beneath the Akoustolith tiles outside the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station , right after we were unpleasantly outed at the sixtieth birthday party for the CEO of a door-hinge distribution company . <br> Tanya Granger , known as Tag to distinguish her from a nursery school classmate named Tanya Tokowsky , had called me an hour earlier to announce that she was hungry . <br> " I 've got frozen pizza and orange juice , " I told her , proud of my stocked fridge . <br> " Julia Child would have been thrilled . No , we 're going to the St. Regis for croquetas and calamares , " Tag informed me . " King of Spain . An anniversary of some kind of truce . Or a trade agreement . Something . " <br> Tag 's days were bookended by strong coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order you 'd expect . We 'd begun crashing out of financial necessity  --  finding free food and drink in New York City was a crucial means of survival  --  but the entertainment value of our pursuit had rapidly become apparent . And Tag had been in dire need of entertaining around the time we 'd started freeloading . Usually rational to a fault , she had impulsively married a Swedish businessman and divorced him six months later , all before the age of twenty-four . " Never accept a marriage proposal made immediately upon surviving the sinking of a Thai ferryboat , " she 'd warn me sternly , as if this was a peril that regularly presented itself . <br> Since her narrow escape from wedlock , she had approached fun very seriously , as seriously as she did her work on behalf of the Museum of Natural History , which required her to slit open the bellies of sharks in places like Madagascar and Borneo . Whether she had a Fallkniven F2 fisherman 's knife in her hand or a dirty martini , Tag was all business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the bowels of Grand Central , decked out and slurping cheap chili in the food court , we agreed that proms were acceptable crash targets . Even though at twenty-seven we were hardly past our prime , we were just old enough to instill some Mrs. Robinson excitement among the restless male members of the Teaneck/Mamaroneck/New Rochelle senior class , who would otherwise be slamming into each other to the beat of " Rock Lobster . " They knew we were interlopers and they welcomed fresh blood . The chaperones kept mum because our enthusiasm on the dance floor  --  we hit proms for the eighties music  --  lured the future of America into chaperonable view . Occasionally , one of the boys would look up from texting a girl on the other side of the room and approach us , probably on a dare from his friends . I would tell him I 'd just served time in a federal penitentiary  --  self-defense , I assured him , glancing modestly at the floor  --  and that this was my first night of freedom . I considered it a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something other than a white limo and some contraband flasks . <br> Corporate Christmas parties were also permissible . Company shindigs were , for Tag , all about the top-shelf liquor . For me , they were glorious opportunities to gossip with people I did n't know , which made it less like gossip and more like . . . honing my empathy skills . Selena from accounts , while complaining about her new boss , Andrea , would let slip some details about her affair with her old boss , Susan  --  yes , that 's Susan  --  who was married to her former boss , Robert . It was like being inside a soap opera for a few hours , and I usually could n't resist helping myself to a cameo role . I 'd pretend I was a therapist specializing in workplace conflict  --  Why did n't they know me ? Oh , I was a friend of Tom 's  --  and they 'd listen intently to my suggestions , which I secretly thought were pretty inspired . Tag suggested more than once that this might actually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of my advice as a gift , or at least as payment for the free mini quiches we were scarfing in lieu of dinner . <br> Diplomatic functions , like the one we thought we were currently at : we attended those for the superb international hors d'oeuvres . We also went with open minds , receptive to the possibility of meeting people who might happen to own yachts and castles . We were not gold diggers , but rather , equal opportunity seekers : Tag wanted to give wealthy foreign dignitaries a chance to fund her next research project , while I remained open to finding true love and life-guiding inspiration at any income level . Soul , I generously acknowledged , was capable of flourishing in bodies other than those of starving writers and musicians . <br> These ambassador bashes were my favorites because I got to play Extreme Make-Believe , which was even more gratifying than commiserating with Selena the accountant or Sam the senior headed for SUNY Binghamton . Call it acting , call it lying , but do n't knock it until you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father 's property in northern Scotland . <br> " I 'm so thrilled that Papa was the younger brother , " I might confide over a plate of caviar , " because although there 's less , you know , money , he has fewer responsibilities . More time to herd sheep and go on quail hunts . No harm , no foul ! " The sheik might or might not get the pun . ( Bonus points if he did . ) <br> Finally , I always had my own personal agenda at these parties . Aside from maybe canoeing the globe solo , there was almost nothing I would n't try to stop myself from thinking about Hayden Briggs for even a few hours . Crashing a party at the St. Regis did n't register high on the list of antidotes , but here I was , yet again hoping for a life-altering experience to wipe that sanity-skewering redhead from my memory . <br> Tonight , as Tag and I cased the crowd from the safety of the coat check room , I took in all the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began constructing a story about my brother 's chain of pubs in Iceland . Because of my unmistakably non-exotic features , I could never invent a brother who owns a Middle Eastern refinery or even a measly olive grove . I 'm five-foot-eight  --  an inch too tall for a lot of guys ' tastes  --  and I reek of second-generation American robust good health . In the old country , I 'd probably have great bone structure , but here , among the fortified cereals and protein boosts , my model potential is safely squirreled away beneath a layer of comfortable padding . I long for Jennifer Aniston 's upper arms , but am secretly quite pleased with my legs , which would look spectacular in the high heels I can never bring myself to endure wearing . I have a thick mass of honey brown hair that would look similarly stunning if I could bother to blow it out . Instead , I keep it just short of nest status with a collection of bent , chipped , fifty-cent Goody barrettes . I have what Tag calls " ish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hint of an almond shape ) , but of indefinable color : greenish , grayish , blueish . <br> Now , I opened my ish eyes as wide as I could , threw a giant smile at the stocky scion manning the door , and made a beeline for the buffet . To crash successfully , you must move confidently . <br> Tag and I grabbed plates and went to work . As I reluctantly passed over the shrimp  --  their farming requires the destruction of mangrove trees , which are natural filters for coastal waters ; ergo , shrimp farming equals death ( bibliography : three-Amstel-Light lecture , Tag , 11th Street Bar , circa 2004 )  --  a male specimen to my right asked me something in a voice so bedroom-savvy I felt the polish slide off my toenails . <br> I looked up . Square jaw  --  my weakness . Cheekbones that could have cut diamonds , another weakness . A huge flop of , yes , black hair . An Achilles ' - heel trifecta . <br> Alas , I understood not a word out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyebrows raised in polite inquiry . No doubt it was the same look he gave to fellow NATO members when discussing nuclear proliferation . I could travel the world with him , starting out as his lover/assistant , and learning the ropes . Within a few years , I 'd be indispensable to the entire organization . One day , I 'd wield the gavel as Secretary General . <br> Ah . He could n't reach the shrimp . As I forked one , then two , then  --  raising an inquiringly seductive eyebrow back at him  --  a third , I began wondering how long it would take to regain a grip on my high school Spanish , and whether there was a quickie Berlitz course in Spanish-for-flirts . As I deposited the last shrimp onto his plate , Ferdinand ( why not ? ) gave me a questioning look regarding my shellfish abstention . Foreseeing the difficulties of miming " mangrove , " I just smiled as coyly as I could while balancing a Coke in one hand and a plate of mini sardine cakes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and grinned in lieu of conversation . Our kids will be gorgeous and bilingual , I thought . <br> Tag appeared at my side , heartlessly derailing my burgeoning courtship . " Zephyr , did they slip you one of these at the door ? " She shoved a picture frame in my face . I glared at her , but she was sipping sangria and frowning at her party favor . I cast Ferdinand a helpless look . He puckered his lips , blew me a little kiss , then slipped away into the crowd . Ciao , my beloved ! I mentally called after him . I mean , Adios ! <br> " Did they ? " Tag repeated , unaware that she had in all likelihood reduced me to permanent spinsterhood . The frame she was studying displayed a collage of photos of a pale and slightly bulgy-eyed beauty . There were shots of her as a grinning infant , as a pre-adolescent waving from a balcony above a herd of charging bulls , and one of her as a teenager , holding a scepter . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2006 , " I concluded reasonably . I spotted a waiter and mentally dug around for the phrase " Do you have any more of those red and green meat things ? " <br> " Well , if it is , they 've done a lousy job . We should be able to tell right away who the celebrant is , what the occasion is , and how we 're supposed to feel by being in the same room as her . " Tag frowned . " I ca n't tell who Miss Spain is , can you ? " <br> Tag had recently dumped the vice president of a branding company ( I had eventually come to understand that his job did n't involve cattle ) . Evidently , he was n't completely out of her system . She tugged at her party-crashing uniform  --  her wedding dress , hacked off at the thighs and dyed a Rockettes-at-Christmas red  --  and looked at me impatiently . <br> I scanned the room , but none of the women was sporting a tiara or cradling a bouquet of roses . A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that the pulchritude percentage in the room was abnormally high . <br> It was a testament to my self-confidence that I considered Tag one of my closest friends ( the label " best " friend , we had decided , was too sixth grade ) , because she was drop-dead gorgeous , and to stand next to her was to make yourself virtually invisible to most men ( save for my loyal Ferdinand ) . With her full-moon brown eyes , lashes out to Jersey , lanky body with curves in only the right places , and Claudia Schiffer-like stature , all topped off by a fountain of inky black curls , Tag made even the straightest woman go tongue-tied . But when you threw in her genuine obliviousness to her beauty , proven by the fact that instead of earning a fortune on runways , she studied sharks ' intestinal tapeworms and did a little dance every time she lit upon a new species , then she was someone around whom you often found your mouth actually hanging open , as if your upper and lower teeth were magnetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is , " I said , spraying a mouthful of crumbs down my dress . As I was brushing them off , though , I got a clue . Like a punch in the gut , a brass band struck up behind us , causing Tag to spray out a mouthful of sangria . <br> Continues ...
