<p> Wine Country has a dirty little secret . <p> Bootlegging  --  the stock-in-trade of whiskey-peddling mafiosi in the 1920s  --  is common practice among California wineries in these modern times . <p> While Prohibition ended 70 years ago , 1930s-era laws in 37 states still restrict wineries ' ability to send vino to customers ' homes . Those restrictions have given rise to a stealthy network of Wine Country shippers who use tricks such as repackaging wine bottles and labeling them as olive oil to move them across state borders . <p> Gov . Gray Davis bumped against those laws just last month , when he was unable to ship a case of Cabernet Sauvignon to Florida to settle a Super Bowl bet with Gov . Jeb Bush . In the Sunshine State , alcoholic beverage shipping is confined to licensed wholesalers and retailers ; sending wine to a residence from out of state through FedEx , United Parcel Service or any other common carrier is strictly verboten . <p> Still , illegal shipping " happens every day  --  it 's standard practice , " said wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting for a winery whose wine club is shipping to every state in the country . I told them , ' You guys are just waiting for something bad to happen . ' " <p> Since unlawful wine shipments skirt official channels , nobody can put a price tag on the trade . <p> RISKS CAN BE HIGH <p> But the risks are high : Winery owners could face jail , fines and permanent revocation of their operating licenses if caught sending wine to states where wine shipping is a felony . <p> In a 1997 sting operation , Maryland authorities fined California 's Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates $35,000 , and three other wineries lesser amounts , for sending wine into the state . <p> Utah in the late 1990s extradited and prosecuted the president of Illinois-based Beer Across America , an Internet beer-of-the-month club . The club was fined $27,000 for shipping beer to customers in the Beehive State ; the same laws apply to wine . <p> The shipping problem reflects a yawning divide in this nation 's values about alcohol consumption . On one side , a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other , Utahns must pay a " membership " fee to order a martini at a bar . <p> Competing financial interests also weigh heavily in the debate . <p> For wineries , turning away business is particularly difficult now , with the economy sluggish and wine prices soft . Sales to out-of-state wine club members can be a critical source of income for wineries that are too small to attract a distributor . <p> State governments have their own concerns  --  they fear losing millions of dollars in sales tax revenue if alcoholic beverages are sold outside official channels . <p> The states have a strong political ally in liquor wholesalers , who aggressively defend their lock on alcoholic beverage transportation . <p> NO CONSENSUS ON HORIZON <p> A consensus among these competing interests is nowhere on the horizon  --  and , in fact , appears increasingly remote . <p> California passed the first law allowing direct shipping in 1986 , and 12 more states have joined since then . Ten other states have passed limited direct-shipping laws . But since 1995 , seven states have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of values more apparent than in Wine Country tasting rooms . Every day , out-of-state tourists ask to ship a favorite wine home . Often they are told : " No can do . " <p> Other times , they get lucky . <p> The Chronicle contacted several local shippers and retail shops , asking whether they would deliver a case of wine to Utah , where even carrying a bottle of wine over the border for personal consumption is unlawful . <p> Some firms said they could n't ship to Utah ; others said they would . Many seemed confused about what 's legal and what 's not . <p> Laurie Kneeland , the owner of Mail Center Etc. in Santa Rosa ( Sonoma County ) , readily agreed to ship wine to Utah . When the caller identified herself as a Chronicle reporter and mentioned the restrictions , Kneeland said she would check her list . <p> " You 're right , there are no shipments that can go to Utah , " she said . " They 're changing the laws all the time . " <p> WINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etc. in the East Bay , when queried about shipping a case of wine to Salt Lake City , said he would be happy to do so , " but it will go as olive oil . " The service would cost $30 , plus an additional $25 to pack it " in disguise , " he said . <p> Freight-forwarding services often label wine shipments as " computer parts , " another shipper said . <p> While some shippers defy the law blatantly , others are the victims of simple confusion . <p> Late last year , Coast Copying &; Shipping , a small shipper in the Mendocino County towns of Willits and Fort Bragg , took out newspaper ads promising to deliver wine to customers ' doorsteps in all 50 states . <p> Coast owner Jack Drucker had contracted with a Los Angeles freight-forwarder whose managers said the firm had permits to ship to homes in every state . <p> After a reporter raised questions , Drucker canceled the service  --  but not before Sally Ottoson , one of his biggest winery clients , had unwittingly broke the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bragg , started taking orders from customers whom she earlier had turned away from her wine club because they live in restricted states . <p> " It 's important for all of us in the business to not appear to be ( flouting ) the law , " said Ottoson . <p> Many wineries are not as careful as Ottoson 's about their wine clubs , according to Del Fava . Wineries commonly fill out shipping forms using members ' " signature on file , " even for states that require customers to buy direct-shipped wine in person . <p> ' DARK SHADE OF GRAY ' <p> This " technically works in a dark shade of gray , " said Del Fava . <p> For serious wine collectors in restricted states , questionable shipping practices come with the territory . <p> " It is common knowledge ( among collectors ) how you can safely negotiate these laws and ship anywhere you want , " said Peter Ekman , chief executive officer of San Francisco 's Wine.com , which caters to such customers . <p> Wine.com has established a network of licensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell wine legally in 29 states . But in the remaining states , Wine.com goods travel through back channels and what Ekman and others describe as " gray areas " of the law . <p> Neil Aldoroty , who runs the wine storage facility 55 Degrees in Napa , works with Wine.com and other retailers . When a customer in a restricted state tries to purchase wine from Wine.com , for example , the Web site directs the customer to Aldoroty for " wine-sourcing options . " <p> For a fee , Aldoroty provides locker space where out-of-state customers can store California purchases . He then provides a list of local shippers who advertise that they will deliver wine to every state and washes his hands of responsibility . <p> " It 's legal , " said Aldoroty of his role . " The onus is on the customer to make arrangements . Then later , they send me e-mail saying , ' Let Joe Blow shipper pick up these wines . ' That 's how it works . " <p> Ekman also disclaims any responsibility . <p> Since customers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected under the law . No state laws penalize their residents who buy and ship wine illegally . " Once it 's your wine , you can do what you want with it , " said Ekman . <p> But liquor-control authorities plan to hold businesses responsible . <p> In Utah , " the winery could be sued and so could all the shippers , " as well as anyone acting as a " clearinghouse " for shipments outside of Utah 's state-controlled liquor system , said Earl Dorius , licensing and compliance director of the Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control . <p> Maryland 's felony law , which passed about three years ago , has discouraged some illegal shipping  --  but the state will still prosecute any " flagrant " violators it catches , said Charles Ehart , director of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Maryland comptroller 's office . <p> " I 'll extradite them if I can , " said Ehart . <p> E-mail Carol Emert at cemert@sfchronicle.com.
