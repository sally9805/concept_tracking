1924-1942 // In Disgrace with Fortune // It was typical of Marlon to enter the world upside down . The breech birth took place shortly after 11 p.m. , April 3 , 1924 , in the Omaha Maternity Hospital . // His earliest home was right out of the imaginings of Hollywood at a time when the film industry , dominated by Jewish immigrants , was beginning to reinvent its host country . If status was denied to these rough , uneducated Eastern Europeans , observed historian Neal Gabler , the movies offered an ingenious option . The first moguls " would fabricate their empire in the image of America . They would create its values and myths , its traditions and archetypes . It would be an America where fathers were strong , families stable , people attractive , resilient , resourceful , and decent . " This is the superficially idyllic America into which Marlon was born . // Yet even in the peaceful Midwest , ideal turf of the Dream Factory , there were dark spots no one could ignore . In the year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold , kidnapped and murdered fourteen-year-old Bobby Franks in a Chicago suburb . That was in May . Detectives closed in shortly afterward , the culprits were arraigned in June , and by August they were on trial for their lives . The defense , headed by star lawyer Clarence Darrow , enlisted mind doctors , " alienists , " in the parlance of the day , to establish irresponsibility by reason of insanity . Sigmund Freud was asked to aid the cause , but he was in fragile health and declined the invitation . After being called " cowardly perverts , " " atheists , " and " mad dogs , " Leopold and Loeb were sentenced to life imprisonment . But the debate about capital punishment continued unchecked , touching the plains and cities of Nebraska . At virtually the same time , Chicago crime raged on , fueled by Prohibition . The outlawing of alcohol had become official in 1920 ; since then the racketeers and illegal importers had grown , peddling booze to the country 's flourishing speakeasies . Turf wars began : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he led some two hundred armed men into Cicero , Illinois , in support of ? Mafia- ? backed politicians . And North Side gang leader Dion O'Banion was shot and killed by three men who had entered his flower shop after hours . The murder began a ? five- ? year war with the Capone gang that was to culminate in the notorious St. Valentine 's Day massacre . // Closer to home , Omaha wrestled with its own Prohibition troubles and with a more intractable problem . Since the end of the Great War , the city 's African American population had more than doubled . With the influx came resentments and racial taunts . The Omaha Bee was particularly inflammatory . The paper 's favorite topic concerned rumored assaults and rapes of white women by black men . The accused were hauled before judges and juries . When they failed to convict , another newspaper , the Mediator , warned of vigilantism in Omaha if the " respectable colored population could not purge those from the Negro community who were assaulting white girls . " A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion erupted . Before it ended , a black man was lynched , two other blacks died of wounds suffered during a street fight , the county courthouse lay in ruins , and the city came under federal military control . // All these provoked conversation at the Brando dinner table through the 1920s and early 1930s , marking an odd contrast to the rustic atmosphere at 1026 South Street . Outwardly all was lyrical . Three children  --  two pretty sisters and their robust younger brother  --  played in the large front yard ; the backdrop was a capacious wood-shingled house redolent of fresh-cut hay , wild flowers , and smoke from a wood-burning stove . In the next decade Andy Hardy movies would take place in just such an environment . // But there was a secondary aroma , and it revealed what no passerby could sense . " When my mother drank , " recalled Marlon , " her breath had a sweetness to it I lack the vocabulary to describe . " A furtive alcoholic , she took frequent hits from a bottle she called her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longer periods with that vessel until , Marlon noted in his memoir , " the anguish that her drinking produced was that she preferred getting drunk to caring for us. " // " Us " referred to Marlon senior and his children , Frances ( known to the family as Frannie ) , Jocelyn ( Tiddy ) , and Marlon junior ( Bud ) . Dodie had reasons for allowing her husband to fend for himself . Wrote his namesake , " It was an era when a traveling salesman slipped five dollars to a bellboy , who would return with a pint of whisky and a hooker . My pop was such a man . " // The condition of such families as the Brandos , and such cities as Omaha , was well known to Sinclair Lewis . He had portrayed them in his 1922 bestseller Babbitt , with its hypocritical real-estate-salesman protagonist and his unhappy wife , and the superficially respectable city in which they lived . " At that moment in Zenith , a cocaine-runner and a prostitute were drinking cocktails in Healy Hanson 's saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , and since Zenith was notoriously law-abiding , they were compelled to keep the cocktails innocent by drinking them out of tea-cups . The lady threw her cup at the cocaine-runner 's head . He worked his revolver out of the pocket in his sleeve , and casually murdered her . " // For Marlon senior , as for George F. Babbitt , money was not a problem ; a peddler of products for contractors and architects , the paterfamilias earned more than enough to maintain his family in solid middle-class comfort . Affection , however , was in short supply . He would return home to shower Dodie with gifts , then journey back to a life of one-night stands . There were presents for the kids as well , but precious little concern . Marlon senior continually denigrated his namesake ; he mocked the boy 's behavior , his way of speaking , his posture . Hugs were only dispensed on birthdays or at Christmastime ; Junior could n't recall a single compliment from his father from kindergarten through adolescence . As a result the child sought attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flouting authority , and getting punished for it . // Senior 's ominous moods and black silences were harder for his daughters to deal with . " I do n't remember forgiveness , " Frannie Brando wrote many years later . " No forgiveness ! In our home , there was blame , shame , and punishment that very often had no relationship to the ' crime , ' and I think the sense of burning injustice it left with all of us marked us deeply . " // That behavior had profound and twisted sources . Although a number of biographies have suggested that the name Brando was originally spelled Brandeau and was of French origin , the family 's founding relative was Johann Wilhelm Brandau , a German immigrant who settled in New York State in the early 1700s . Neighbors who remembered Marlon senior from his school days said there was something " Teutonic and closed " about the youth , but this may have been the perception of hindsight . In any case , he had reason to be withdrawn ; his mother ran off without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandoned father varied between dark and uncommunicative periods and loud , unpredictable demands . In adolescence , Marlon senior was shunted from one spinster aunt to another . He grew up rude and misogynistic , given to binge drinking and bullying . Bud came to see his father in cinematic terms as a British officer in the Bengal Lancers , " perhaps a Victor McLaglen with more refinement . " // Dorothy Pennebaker came from a background of mavericks , gold prospectors , and Christian Scientists . She married at twenty-one but continued to attract whistles and social attention as a vivacious flapper with artistic yearnings . Early on , Dodie made a small name for herself by cultivating members of Omaha 's little bohemian colony , and beating out the competition for roles at the Omaha Community Playhouse . From walk-ons and juvenile leads she progressed to starring parts in Pygmalion and Anna Christie . It occurred to Dodie that she might take a trip to New York and try a stab at Broadway-especially after she won rave reviews for her appearance in Beyond the Horizon opposite a twenty-one-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marlon senior 's rages , as well as his open and continual adulteries , eroded her confidence on- and offstage . She consumed more liquor , took her own lovers , and narrowed her creative impulses. // Like many homes of the period , the Brando house had a piano in the parlor . Radio was still in its infancy , and recordings were still only a pale echo of true musical sound . Dodie had received lessons as a child , and she still got more pleasure out of playing than she did out of listening . Solos at the keyboard supplanted group work at the theater . Surrounded by her children  --  in one of the very few family activities-she played folk airs and popular numbers , from Irving Berlin 's inventive tunes to a list of lesser numbers , including " I 'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover " and " Am I Blue ? " To please her , Marlon learned them all . He could never summon up the digits of his Social Security I.D. , and there were times when he could n't recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those days around the keyboard never left him . When , at the age of sixty-five , he wrote his autobiography , scores of titles were suggested by friends and publishers , but in the end he settled on Songs My Mother Taught Me. // 2 // When Bud was six , the Calcium Carbonate Corporation offered his father a new job as sales manager . Employment opportunities were few in 1930 , the first full year of the Depression . Marlon senior seized the day , even though it meant relocation to Evanston , Illinois . His wife was not so happy with the decision ; she still clung to the fading illusion of herself as a stage star , and Evanston had no playhouse and few nonconformists . // Dodie struggled to get her bearings in the new neighborhood . Melancholia settled in like an old acquaintance who had come for a weekend visit and refused to go away . Every day the Chicago Tribune brought bad news , and every week Time magazine summed them up . Breadlines across the country , new bankruptcies . And lynchings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories aloud to the kids , unsure of whether the reports went over their heads or burrowed into their psyches . " All night two hundred men and boys searched for Davie Harris , found him at dawn , cringing in an empty barn . They lugged him up to the levee , mocked his yammerings for mercy . ' De Lord save me , ' cried Harris as guns cracked about him , shots riddled his body . Deputy Sheriff Dayu arrived ' too late ' to make arrests . Deputy Sheriff Courtney expected no investigation ' until next fall . ' " // In the back of the publications Dodie read news of live performances in the East . They opened old wounds . Like the rest of the country , Broadway was suffering from financial woes . The year before there had been 233 productions ; this year there would be 187 , and fewer were scheduled for next year . Vaudeville was reeling ; five years before there were fifteen hundred theaters in the circuits . One fifth remained . And yet the Fabulous Invalid went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . Eva Le Gallienne 's Civic Repertory staged Allison 's House , based on the life of Emily Dickinson ; it was said to be a shoo-in for the Pulitzer . Maxwell Anderson 's Elizabeth the Queen starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne at the Guild Theatre . Eugene O'Neill 's Marco Millions was successfully revived at the Liberty . The Gershwins had a new show , Girl Crazy . " I Got Rhythm " was on the radio every night ; you could n't get away from it . The columnists said that Ethel Merman could hold a note longer than the Chase National Bank . And Harold Arlen had written the score for Earl Carroll 's Vanities . I should have gone east , Dodie would muse aloud . It 's not too late even now . // Then again , that might not be the best move . Three quarters of the New York actors were supposed to be heading for Hollywood . And why not ? The studios dominated show business now that sound had come in . Powerful men ran them : Goldwyn , Mayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the public like a map . All Quiet on the Western Front and Hell 's Angels were playing everywhere . Who knew that this would be the year to look back at the Great War ? They did . Who knew that you could make money with a gangster picture like The Widow from Chicago ? Who knew you could make a star of Edward G. Robinson , a little Jewish man with fat lips ? They did . Maybe I should have gone west , not middle west , Dodie grumbled . Meantime , the neighbors whispered that Mrs. Brando was the kind of woman who saw the glass as half full . That was because she had drunk the other half . // The rumors were cruel , and they were accurate . Too many afternoons Dodie disappeared into an alcohol-saturated haze , unreachable by her children . Frannie and Tiddy were on the cusp of adolescence and found new friends at the tony Lincoln School . Bud attended the same institution , but retreated into his own fantasies . The most obsessive of these concerned the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Ermi . During the day he played card games with her ; at night the two often slept in the same bed . She was nude , he remembered-though this might have been a boy 's wishful dream- and a sound sleeper . On his part the attachment was all-consuming ; to her it was of no importance whatever . In fact , she never bothered to tell him that she was about to be married . The housekeeper merely informed him one day that she was leaving on a trip and would return soon . // It took several weeks for Bud to realize that Ermi was not coming back . The night he realized she was gone forever , he experienced a foretaste of death . " I felt abandoned , " he said almost five decades later . " My mother had long ago deserted me for her bottle ; now Ermi was gone , too . " To Bud this was one of the informing incidents of his childhood . Looking back he decided that Ermi 's defection kept repeating itself in his life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point-and then abruptly and permanently exit . According to Marlon , the day Ermi went away " I became estranged from this world . " That summary contained everything a self-dramatizing figure could desire : bittersweet melodrama , unrequited romance , and Freudian insight . It might even have been true . // In her study Adult Children of Alcoholics , Dr. Janet Geringer Woi ? titz lists the characteristics of her subjects when young . They tend to : // Guess what normal behavior is. // Lie when it would be just as easy to tell the truth . // Judge themselves without mercy . // Constantly seek approval and affirmation . // Be impulsive . Such behavior would lead to confusion , self-loathing and loss of control . // All these attributes were part of Bud 's emerging temperament . At home , as he saw it , " there was a constant , grinding , unseen miasma of anger . " Infected by the rage around him , he continued to act out his hostilities , burning insects , slashing tires , tiptoeing close to birds-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him as a birthday present . Bud was no happier in the classroom than he was in the house . One morning he took a can of lighter fluid , squirted the word shit on a blackboard and ignited the letters . The incident helped to burnish his bad-boy reputation ; he seemed to thrive on that . All the same , after every incident there came a time of remorse and self-reproach. //
