Section : Outlook 2002 ; Cover Package ; Special Report ; A Changing Nation After September 11 , America struggles to find a new kind of normalcy <p> Never has normal looked so nice , nor dull so desirable . Never have phrases like " nothing much new " and " just another day at the office " been so welcome . We long not to forget but only to return , to return to those days when we could switch on the television set safe in the assumption that just the Dow might be plummeting and not whole office towers . And as we tiptoe softly into a new year , hoping not to attract any attention from the gods of interesting times , we look forward to a year that is merely better  --  for how could one be worse ? <p> Perhaps we are getting there already . Signs exist . The war in Afghanistan is nearly won with very few deaths on our side . The anthrax killer still eludes capture , but both casualties and fears have subsided . And the latest polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them . <p> A Democracy Corps poll conducted in the first week of December shows the economy and jobs eclipsing terrorism and security as the nation 's No. 1 concern . When a poll taken by Bloomberg that same week asked Americans if their lives had returned to normal , 64 percent said they had . Once upon a time , in March to be specific , when Gallup asked Americans to name their worst fears , neither Osama bin Laden nor a powdery white substance made the list . Our worst fears then seem almost charming now : snakes , followed by public speaking , followed by heights . <p> That changed dramatically , of course , but people may be heading back to the good old days : Public Opinion Strategies has done 11 national surveys since September 11 and its latest poll , conducted the week of December 10 , shows that while Americans are still overwhelmingly " sad , " " angry , " " disgusted , " and " outraged " over the attacks , 16 percent fewer are " nervous , " 15 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " depressed , " and 10 percent fewer are " scared " than in late September . <p> " Americans are beginning to move on , " says pollster Bill McInturff . " We 're seeing the beginning of a new normal ' as we all adjust to a world after the attacks . " The media insist on using September 11 as an excuse to commit sociology , however . The reported phenomena , real and imagined , include a baby-sitter glut because parents are staying home , fewer fixer-uppers being sold because people want instant gratification , and more guns being purchased apparently out of the belief that terrorists will soon be making house calls . <p> Optimism overall . Three major forces currently drive our lives : no new terrorism at home , military victories abroad , and increased worries about unemployment . In other words , Americans are now more worried about losing their jobs than losing their lives . There is a fourth factor , one that is harder to define : Call it uncrushable American optimism . Far more people think the economy will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who think it will get worse ( about 15 percent ) . Trust in government is the highest it has been in 35 years , largely because Americans have rallied around a president that a majority of them did not vote for . George W. Bush has assumed the mantle of a wartime president and the popularity that goes with it . " I was with him the entire time on the 11th of September and as soon as he got on the airplane , he said : This is war , ' " White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told U.S. News . " In the meeting with congressional leaders on the 12th , Bush again referred to it as war , and a very prominent Democrat urged him to exercise rhetorical care ' and not to use words like that . And the point I 'm making is I think the real test here of why our nation rallied the way it did is that the president right from the word go took us to the point where the country rallied to war . " <p> There is no clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to when the struggle might end . President Bush , after all , has pledged to " rid the world of evil , " and the White House wants to make sure the nation is prepared for a long-term struggle against terrorism . " Think about it , " Fleischer said . " Do we want the world to live with more Lockerbies ? More Berlin discos ? Do we want people in our embassies to live in forts ? The president really sees this as an opportunity to do something fundamental for the world and our children , and Phase 2 is already engaged on the financial front and the arrest front around the world . . . . While I ca n't state with certainty that Phase 2 will be military , it very well might . " <p> No one suggests that the president would continue combat for political purposes , but some analysts say a continuing war could help the Republican Party . " If the war continues in the Philippines , Somalia , or Iraq , for instance , " said one Republican strategist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will splinter into an antiwar faction like they did in 1968 . " <p> For now , however , Republican analysts are warning Republican officeholders that Bush 's popularity will not help their own re-election in 2002 . " The country will rally around Bush but not around Republicans , " political consultant Mike Murphy told Republican governors at their annual meeting a few weeks ago . " We are fools if we rely on Bush to bail us out . " Murphy pointed out that of the 36 governorships up for election next year , 23 are held by Republican incumbents , and " a bad economy is bad news for incumbents . " And September 11 has been extremely bad news for the states , 36 of which have been forced to start cutting their budgets in the face of shrinking tax revenue . <p> Next year , Americans say , they intend to focus on jobs , healthcare , education , Social Security , and the environment . And if things go really well , maybe we will all have a year in which snakes are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The tears and fears of the early days have begun to fade . <p> By Roger Simon <p>
