On Feb. 27 , 1860 , a little-known Midwesterner named Abraham Lincoln established himself as a national candidate for President by delivering an intellectually rigorous dismantling of the constitutional arguments for slavery at Cooper Union in New York City . Ever since , politicians have stood on the same podium and given immortality their best shot . It was Howard Dean 's turn last week  --  and his Cooper Union appearance provided an inadvertent insight into the nature of his campaign . <P> Dean made news on two fronts . He apologized to the sons and daughters of the Confederacy , black and white , for his politically incorrect assertion that he planned to court voters who put Confederate-flag decals on their pickup trucks . ( In his speech , Lincoln also engaged in some hand-wringing about his party 's inability to win support down South . ) But Dean 's true purpose was to announce his desire to abandon the public campaign-finance system , as George W. Bush has done , and test his campaign 's amazing ability to raise money from the grass roots against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dean put this choice to an Internet vote of his supporters and , not surprisingly , they followed his wishes . <P> There was some high-minded grumbling from Dean 's increasingly desperate opponents about his decision to jump the federal spending restraints  --  he is the first Democrat to do so since the system began in 1974  --  but the move made perfect sense . If he wins the nomination , Dean will be facing the best-financed presidential campaign in history , and he 'll need all the financial help he can get . The probable endorsements this week from SEIU and AFSCME , the huge service and public-employees unions , will give Dean a major lift when it comes to ground support . Still , it was a bit unsettling to see the Democratic front runner use the hallowed stage at Cooper Union as the forum for an address on ... fund raising . <P> Dean tricked out his speech  --  a prepared text , delivered indifferently  --  with references to the power of the special interests and the need to clean house in Washington . But no amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about process , not ideas . Indeed , Dean 's whoosh of a campaign has n't featured very much creative policy thinking . Think about it : Apart from his early stand against the war in Iraq , what has distinguished Dean 's candidacy from that of the other Democrats ? The propellant for the Dean surge has been almost all style and process  --  the Internet successes ; the monthly Meetups ; his stirring , plainspoken pugnacity ; the joyful abandon of his campaign  --  and the sense of community he has aroused in his supporters .
