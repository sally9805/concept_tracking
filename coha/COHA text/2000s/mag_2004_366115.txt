Marriage can be a pill . Especially when you have been hired to kill your husband and  --  unbeknownst to you  --  he has been retained to return the favor . In next June 's Mr. and Mrs. Smith , BRAD PITT and ANGELINA JOLIE play married assassins who keep their real identities secret until they each get assigned a job that hits a little too close to home . The fallout is matrimonial as much as it is martial . Now , do n't worry : there are still pyrotechnics and Jolie 's trademark self-performed stunts . But in the end , the characters find that the toughest thing about a day at the office is coming home afterward . " We 're impressed by the wrong things , " says director Doug Liman , who did the Bourne action-adventure franchise . " Try to make a woman happy for six years of marriage . I 'd like to see James Bond do that . "
