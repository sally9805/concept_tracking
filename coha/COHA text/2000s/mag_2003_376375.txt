On the dock of Abu Fulus port , 20 miles south of Basra , Bassem Saghair deftly works the controls of a crane as he unloads air-conditioning units from the hold of the Hussaini . The ship is one of a dozen crowding the waterfront that have sailed from Dubai up the Shatt al-Arab River laden with consumer goods . Saghair , 15 , quit school for this job , which pays $360 a month , double the highest salary any Iraqi official earns from U.S.-occupation authorities . " Life is not bad , " says Saghair , with a shy smile spreading under the beginnings of a mustache . <P> Abu Fulus , which means " father of money , " was little used during Saddam Hussein 's regime , but with U.N . sanctions against Iraq lifted and all import and customs controls unenforced , the port has become an unofficial entry point for used cars , electronics , clothes and food . There are no government officials here and no British soldiers from the garrison in Basra . Merchants walk up and down the dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jeans with AK-47s guard against pirates who prowl the river in motorboats . As in the American frontier a century ago , fortunes are being made almost overnight in Iraq , and with the same lack of control . As Saghair hoists a load of fruit from the bottom of the hold , a coconut falls out of the lifting net , narrowly missing a docker 's head . What safety procedures are in place at the port ? he is asked . He smiles again : " There is no law here . " <P> Iraq is a country where lawlessness comes in many forms . At its most lethal it is the car bombs in Baghdad , the ambushes of U.S. troops around Fallujah , the shootings in Tikrit . But outside the deadly Sunni triangle , the absence of law has produced a chaotic sense of freedom that leaves Iraqis both exhilarated and terrified . To get a clearer picture of conditions in the entirety of Iraq  --  particularly in the north and south , which have received less media attention  --  TIME teamed up with ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 30 towns and conducting more than 600 interviews with Iraqis from all levels of society . We found dramatic contrasts between Greater Baghdad and the rest of the country . <P> Security , which almost all Iraqis say is their major concern , is far better in both the north and south than it is in the capital . Electricity is much more reliable outside Baghdad . There are almost no power cuts in the south , a region that often had six or less hours of electricity a day before the war . Schools are mostly back to normal , and commerce is booming as goods flood in across the Turkish and Kuwaiti borders . The military presence of the U.S. in the north and the British in the south is far less visible than are the U.S. forces in and around Baghdad . Despite sporadic ambushes , the foreign troops are largely tolerated by locals , who tend to view them as a necessary evil until a viable Iraqi administration is in place .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
