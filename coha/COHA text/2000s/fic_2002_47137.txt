1 . <p> I am my father 's sidekick , Mutt to his Jeff , Costello to Abbott , Tonto to the Lone Ranger . I am his pal , his fall guy . I follow him like a shadow . He calls me " Me Too . Sure there 's a comic strip character named Me Too , but I am too young to know that . I fall into the name . " Me Too , " I say whenever my father puts on his overcoat after supper , announcing in this gesture that he will walk across the street to the candy store where he 'll buy a package of Lucky Strikes , stand around or sit at the counter , and drink a cup of coffee . This is the world of men , and I want to be there , sitting on a stool next to my father , sipping milk through a straw , and spinning around inside their voices . The house where we live has a small hallway where I stand , clutching the rough wool of my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long length of his body . He looks down , and he teases . " Hey , Pipsqueak . Hey , Runt . Whadda ya want ? " <p> He knows , of course . Still , I do what I have to do , beg and plead . " Please , Daddy , please , take me with you . I 'll be good . I wo n't ask questions . I promise . ' <p> He laughs , ruffles my hair , then signals my mother . " Get her coat . " <p> My father is tough , and he 's smart . He smokes cigarettes ; he plays cards , poker and gin rummy . He places bets off the track . One day , when I am five , my father stops a runaway horse . We 're driving to the Jersey Shore , stopped in traffic the way you stopped then , cars bumper to bumper on the white-hot highway . Other cars have pulled off the road , and they sit , hoods raised , radiators overheating and leaking steam , whole families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . It 's hot outside , hot in . My mother fans herself with her hand . Chrome glints . My father leans over the wheel . He talks to himself . He talks to us . " I ca n't understand it . Why do n't they move ? I 'm telling you , never again , so do n't ask . " <p> I 'm the one who pleads and whines , the one who wants to build castles in the sand , to swim in the ocean , walk the Boardwalk , eat cotton candy , ride the rides , then play the wheels of fortune with my father and Grandma Rose . I kneel on the backseat . On the other side of the windshield , a long line of cars stretches to a place my father calls infinity . I move my lips , and I pray , " Please , God , make them move . " <p> My father shakes his head . His fingers tap the wheel . I hold my breath , making myself small and still . If I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , pull out into the empty lane beside us , and drive home . He does that , changes direction without warning . Then , I see it , a horse racing across a field , the rider bent low . In trouble . <p> Summers , when my father was a boy , he worked at the pony ride on the Boardwalk , holding the reins and leading children around the ring . When I was a baby , he lifted me up into a saddle , then led me around the same track . I have pictures of me when I 'm one , sitting on a pony 's back , my father 's hand steadying me . When I 'm three , I ride alone . My father slaps the pony into a trot . The pony canters . I hold his mane in my fists . Still , I fall off , fall down into the grit , hitting my hip , scraping skin . Blood seeps , then flows . I let out a long , deep howl . My father ties his handkerchief around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the saddle . " You do n't want to be a crybaby , do you ? " <p> I want to be brave like my father , so when he takes off across an empty field that morning in July and chases a runaway horse , I 'm not surprised , I 'm furious . I belong in that field , running beside my father . The rider is a girl . I see her long hair , streaming . Then , I see the shape of her sliding down , riding along the horse 's flank . I climb up into the front seat , lean over my mother 's lap , and stretch my body outside the opened window . The chrome burns . I do n't care . I am calling to my father . <p> That afternoon , telling the story to Grandma Rose , my father boasts , " She coulda been killed . Lucky for her I was there . No telling what woulda happened . I headed him off , then grabbed the reins . You shoulda seen her face . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're sitting on a rough , wool blanket on the sand , my mother , my father , and me . Grandma Rose sits in her beach chair . My grandpa Harry , who is n't my real grandfather , just a man married to Rose , is n't with us . Sandal , my real grandfather , died when my father was twelve , and this , I learn early , is the great sadness of my father 's life and the reason I must be nice to my father . At all times . <p> Grandma Rose reaches for her bathing cap . She takes my hand . This is n't the first time my father has told that story . " Come , " Rose says to me . <p> My father 's smile twists . The corners of his mouth turn down . Overhead gulls wheel . " Where 're you taking her ? " he asks Rose . " For a swim , " Rose says . <p> " She just ate , " my father says . <p> " We 'll dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's story is gone , swallowed up by something I ca n't name . I stand at the edge of the blanket , looking down at the sand , tiny grains of tan and white , flecked with brown , flecked with sparkles , sinking down under my feet as I walk , stretching my legs , then leaping , matching Rose 's stride . Rose smiles . " A regular gazelle , " she says to me . <p> Gazelle is a funny word , and I laugh . Rose laughs , too . Secretly ( secretly , because I ca n't tell my father , although I 'm not sure why ) , I look up to Rose . She 's pretty , and she 's fun . She 's like my father . Like me . We have a certain sparkle in our eyes , a zest when we walk . We 're strong-minded and strong-willed . We 're volatile , the kind of people who act before we think . Not that I can say these things about us , not then . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is doing this very minute , sitting on our blanket , smoking a Lucky Strike , fuming , and complaining to my mother . About me . About Rose . <p> Today , Rose 's suit is turquoise blue . It has a deep V that shows the cleft in her breasts . It has legs . She does n't wear those old-lady skirts . Her skin is tanned , all these summers in Asbury Park , winters in Miami Beach . She smells sweet , like coconut candy . The ocean licks my toes , rises to my knees . I look back . On the beach , blankets blend into sand ; figures watch without faces . A wave rolls . " Jump , " Rose says . <p> Together , we fly up and over the wave 's curl . <p> That night , my father slaps a dime on the number seven . The Boardwalk is crowded , rides and concessions . The air smells of salt and sea , sugar and hot oil . People push . My father lifts me up and sets me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortune spins . Spins and spins . Rose leans and whispers . " You 're going to win . " <p> " Number seven , " the barker shouts . " Number seven , the winner here . Give the little lady choice of the stand . " <p> 2 . <p> I am eleven when Sarah , my other grandmother , dies . Sarah is n't Rose . I do n't want to be Sarah , but I love her with all of the love I hold tight inside of me . My mother covers the mirrors . She pushes the furniture to the walls . My uncles bring wooden crates for us to sit on . This is called sitting shiva . My father , a Reform Jew , a modern Jew , does n't believe in sitting shiva . He beckons , and I follow . I climb into his yellow Studebaker and slam the door . " Where 're we going ? " <p> " The relatives are coming from New York . " <p> I nod and pretend I understand . We drive and park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father buys salami and rolled beef . Where does he think he 's taking that meat ? " Dad , " I say . <p> " What ? " he says , silencing me . <p> In the kitchen , I curve my back and lean into the doorframe , feeling the wood with the bumps of my spine . A swinging door leads to the dining room , and I am poised to escape . All of my aunts and uncles have gathered here to watch my father roll and place each slice of meat on a platter , a flesig platter that has never held unkosher meat , and that 's what I say , hardly realizing I 'm speaking out loud . " It 's not kosher . " <p> A piercing quiet holds my words , holds them like the aftermath of a siren 's wail . My father 's eyes find my face , and he glares . <p> " What 's not kosher ? " Uncle Gabe 's voice booms . Gabe is Sarah 's favorite son . The feisty one . <p> I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Gabe says . " Your father brought traif into the house . " <p> I look down . I 'm wearing saddle shoes that I 've polished myself . The white streaks . I can never polish smoothly , never keep the white from edging up over the brown . My laces are dirty . Inside the plaid , the white has grayed . <p> " Take it out , " Gabe says to my father . He is not a tall man , but he is solid . <p> " You 're telling me what to do , " my father says . <p> " It 's a house of mourning , " Gabe says . <p> " They 're coming from New York . What do you want them to eat ? " <p> " Please , " my aunt Betty says . <p> " You stay out of this , " my father says . <p> " You do n't talk to my wife that way , " Gabe says . <p> " What ? What did I say ? " <p> Uncle Gabe reaches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , I will . " <p> " Over my dead body . " <p> The platter totters . My mother catches it . My father is pushing , pushing and pointing into Uncle Gabe 's chest , tapping with his index finger . My uncle heaves him back . My father 's shoulder hits the refrigerator . He recovers , quickly , swings a punch , and misses . Uncle Gabe lifts a hand . A gesture of surrender . " Enough already . " <p> My father does n't answer . He lands a blow to the side of my uncle 's head . Gabe 's glasses fly and crash . My uncle Irving picks up the broken frame . He curses my father . A fayer zol du trefin , you should burn up . Di beyner zol du oysrinen , may your bones be drained of marrow . Du zol vaksn vi a tsibele mit dem kop in drerd , you should grow like an onion with its head in the ground . <p> Uncle Gabe lands a blow on my father 's chin . A tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father . Uncle Harry pushes Gabe . Separated , the two men glare . They blow out their breath . I slink back and wiggle through the tiny opening between the swinging door and the frame . Noiselessly , I climb the stairs . Outside , car doors slam . Engines start . The house is still , the air hanging so quietly , I realize I 'm holding my breath , listening for a single sound , one that will tell me where my father is . I want to hear the engine of the Studebaker starting up , then revving . That will mean Father has left . Stormed out . Instead , I hear footsteps in the dining room , then on the stairs . A heavy silence crushes my heart . I feel him . I hear his breathing . He has to knock . In this house we knock . We do n't just open a door . My door flies open . My father glares ; my father shouts . " See what you did . See what trouble you caused . Now are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets go . I fall off my bed , scramble up , grab a pillow , and hold on . <p> " I 'm talking to you . " <p> Silence . <p> " I said I 'm talking to you . Now answer me . <p> " What ? What did I do ? " <p> He mocks me . " What ? What did I do ? " <p> " Stop it . " <p> " Stop it . " <p> " I hate you . Hate your guts . " <p> My father 's eyes turn to glass . He unbuckles his belt , pulls it , slowly , through the loops . I ca n't believe what I 'm seeing . My father is not swinging his belt , bringing it down on my shoulders , my arm , my leg . I scramble from my bed . I cower in a corner . I cry ; I beg . " Please , Daddy , please . No more . I 'll be good . I promise . " <p> But my father has a rhythm now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brings the belt down on my flesh , each stroke a word he spits from his tongue . " Show you . Own damn fault . Ca n't keep your mouth shut . Can you ? Can you ? " <p> Time turns to burning flesh , and I feel as if I 'm dying here under my father 's belt . <p> Now , my mother 's figure fills the doorway . Where was she ? Where was my damn mother ? She whispers my father 's name . " Leo . Leo . " <p> My father snaps his head . " You stay out of this . " <p> I think she 's announcing an arrival-the relatives from New York , my aunt Ida , my uncle Nat , my cousins , Seymour and Lorraine . <p> " Leo , " she says , " Rose is here . Your mother . " <p> And in my mother 's voice , I hear not reproof , but warning . <p> Rose calls up the stairs . " Leo , where is everybody ? What 're you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father slips the tongue of his belt through the loops . " Do n't think I 'm finished with you , " he says to me . <p> But he is . And I know it . <p> 3 . <p> I am a precocious , ponytailed , cinch-waisted teenager . I go to dances ; I date boys , boys who drive cars . I come home with my lipstick smeared and my cheeks on fire . My father flicks the porch light , blinking it on and off . " Got ta go , " I mutter to Danny . He holds on , lips groping for my lips , fingers searching under my bra . I push him away , then reach for the door handle . Our house sits on a rise . Neighbors have planted rock gardens on the slope . We have grass my father ca n't mow . Danny lags behind on the steep wooden steps . The front door opens . Danny stops . I want to turn back and flee with him to his car . My feet wo n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought I told you eleven o'clock . " <p> After the movie , Danny and I drove a winding road to the top of South Mountain , watched the lights of New York City across the river , dreamed our dreams , kissed and kissed . Now , I watch my father 's waist . If he moves right , I 'll move left , slip past him , race up the stairs , and into my room . I 'll grab a chair , then shove the back of it under the knob . No locks , not on the bedroom doors . Locks on the bathroom doors , but I 'm not allowed to use them . What if something happens ? How can we save you ? <p> Inside the small hallway , my father presses his fingers into my arm . My flesh turns white . He shouts , and he spits . His face contorts . " Do you know what time it is ? Where have you been ? Look at you . You should see yourself . " <p> Danny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stiffen under my father 's touch . " Let go . If you do n't let go , I 'll call up Grandma Rose . I 'll tell her you 're beating me . " <p> His grip loosens , and he mumbles . " Bitch . " <p> I do n't care what he calls me . I 'm gone , flying up the stairs and into my room . Now my father 's fury pounds the door . Let him shout . He wo n't come in , I know he wo n't . <p> " I 'm warning you , Shelly , keep this up , and you 're out on the street . You think I do n't mean it ? You 're no good , do you hear ? No damn good . " <p> I lie on my bed fully dressed , bladder full , afraid to leave my room and use the toilet . My belly aches . Urine leaks . I feel it inside my underpants . I think of Danny 's hand sliding under my blouse , under my bra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my legs . Maybe I am what my father says I am , a tramp , a slut , a lousy whore . <p> 4 . <p> My father calls from his store . This is what my father does . Owns a camera store . He and my mother work together . My mother sells film and greeting cards . My father sells cameras and enlargers . " I 'm bringing your grandmother home " he says to me . " I want you to stay with her until I can bring her back . " <p> Rose no longer spends her summers in Asbury Park or her winters in Miami Beach . Harry died years before . Rose lives in a house that is part rooming house , part nursing home , along with three other old people . She is not allowed to leave . I wonder how Rose got to my father 's store . " I took the bus , " Rose tells me . <p> " Three buses , " my father says , shaking his head . He looks at me . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave ? " <p> We 're standing in the driveway , Rose , my father , and I. I 'm nineteen , a sophmore in college , home on spring break . I reassure my father , then take Rose 's arm . Her skin is so soft I feel her bones . Inside the house , she steps back . " Let me look at you . " Her eyes are gentle , like fingers on my skin . She smiles . Her blue eyes glint . " A real looker . Like me . I 'm still not bad , am I ? " She turns for me to see . <p> That afternoon Rose and I play double solitaire . We play gin . Rose wins six games out of ten . We watch game shows on TV . We pop popcorn , then toss kernels into the air and try to catch them in our mouths . At five-thirty , my mother arrives . I lift a brown paper shopping bag from her arms . Inside are veal chops , a head of iceberg lettuce she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heinz ketchup , making Russian dressing . Rose sits at the kitchen table . She opens the bakery box my mother carried home and peers inside . She sticks a finger in the frosting , then licks . " Whipped cream . Why is n't this in the icebox ? " <p> After supper , my father tells Rose he 's taking her home . Rose says her room is cold . When Rose complains , Mrs. Ledger , the landlady , tells her to shut up . " Imagine that , " Rose says . And that is n't all . Mrs. Ledger ca n't cook . Nothing has any taste . Rose has not left the kitchen table . She sits in her chair as if she 's claimed it . " This is the first decent meal I 've eaten in God knows when . " <p> Tears cloud Rose 's blue eyes . They fall down onto her cheeks . Standing behind Rose 's chair , I grip her shoulders . My father mouths a single word . " Senile . " <p> Yeah , right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hair . She cries , softly . <p> My father rubs his bald head with two fingers . It is a gesture of frustration . He is tired . Wearing down . " Let 's go , " he says to Rose . <p> I watch my father carefully . Will he blow or give in ? I take the risk . " She can sleep with me . I 'll drive you to work , then take her back in the morning . " <p> My father does n't speak . <p> " It 's not a bad idea , " my mother says . She scrubs the broiler pan . <p> My father drifts toward the living room . He turns on the TV . Soon , all of us sit and watch . <p> This is the one and only year Ford has made a hardtop convertible , a Skyliner , and my father owns one . I drop him at the store , drive out of town , then pull to the side of the road . I push a button to lower the top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway , then you have to drive to a service station with the roof of the car arcing like an umbrella . Today , it slips back easily . I hand Rose a kerchief . She ties it around her hair . I tie one around my hair . I turn on the radio , The Platters , Elvis Presley , then music from Gigi , " Thank Heaven for Little Girls ! Rose sings along , as we fly down the Garden State . <p> At the Shore , mostly , the concessions are boarded up . Still , Rose and I walk the Boardwalk . " Remember the day your father won that teddy bear ? " she says to me . " It was bigger than you were . <p> " Lucky seven . " <p> " That 's it , " Rose says . <p> I spot an open hot dog stand where I order two hot dogs , two root beers , and fries that come inside paper cone cups . The day is sunny , but windy . I 've brought along sweaters and coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . The beach stretches in front of us . There are no blankets , no umbrellas , just sand and the ever-present , ever-rolling sea . Rose bites her hot dog . She chews . " You 're a good girl , " she says to me . " You 're smart , and you 're lucky . You 'll finish college . You 'll be somebody . Do n't let anybody stop you . Are you listening to me ? " <p> " I 'm listening . " <p> 5 . <p> Rose is the youngest of six siblings , all boys , the only child living at home when Simon , her father , dies . Like my father , Rose is a child of early loss . Hannah , Rose 's mother , runs a boarding house . The family is poor . Rose leaves school and goes to work . She is young . She is beautiful . I imagine her wearing a tailored shirtwaist with leg-of-mutton sleeves , a high collar , an ascot tied at her neck . Her dark floor-length skirt falls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside door , then steps down onto the sidewalk . She walks to the corner where she boards a trolley , riding out of her lower-class Jewish neighborhood and into Center City , where she works at Wanamaker 's modeling gloves . She meets men . <p> Rose visits Albert , her brother who lives in New York City . Albert moves from job to job . He calls himself an inventor . He makes rich friends . One of those friends is Sandal Green . Before Albert introduces Sandal to Rose , he wags a finger in his sister 's face . " I 'm warning you , Rosie , do n't fool around with this one . " <p> Rose is twenty-eight and pregnant when she marries Sandal . Sandal 's family sends him to dental school . My uncle is born in Maryland . When Sandal finishes school , his father buys him a house in New Jersey . A river and a world separate Rose and Sandal from Sandal 's family in Manhattan . Eight years pass before my father is born . When my father is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . My father skips school . He sits on a park bench , staring into space . Rose takes in boarders . Sandal has left her not only with unfathomable grief , but with a ledger of unpaid accounts and a mortgage to pay . <p> 6 . <p> I wake in my virginal bed , my husband 's erection prodding my ass , his arm flung over my body . My bedroom door is closed . " No , " I say to my husband . <p> " Why not ? " <p> I feel my father in these walls , see his eyes on the ceiling . I fling back the covers . In the bathroom , I shower and wash my hair . Dressed in jeans and a man 's shirt , I walk down the stairs . In spite of the fact that this is the first time in the ten days we have been married that I can not make love with my husband , I feel a certain freedom . Or is it smugness ? I 'm a married woman . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good morning , " I chirp . <p> My father sits at the kitchen table . He does n't speak , nor does he lift his eyes to look at me . He picks up his cup of coffee , and he slurps . <p> " Good morning , " my mother says . " Sleep well ? " <p> I assume she heard me in the bathroom , then on the stairs , because now she 's scrambling eggs , anticipating in the way she does . She scoops eggs onto a plate . My father stands . He lifts the newspaper from the table . My husband enters . My father mumbles and leaves the kitchen . Did he say good morning ? Now , my mother is scrambling two more eggs , asking my husband how he likes them . <p> " Soft , " my husband says . <p> " Soft , " my mother says . <p> In this house we like our eggs cooked hard and well . <p> " Like this ? " my mother says . <p> " Perfect , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I fall into a rhythm . I carry dishes to the sink . She rinses and loads the dishwasher . I tell her about Bermuda , the lush flowers , the turquoise sea , the motorbikes we rented and drove all over the island . <p> My mother nods . She is happy for me . <p> The next day , my husband and I board a plane for Cincinnati , my new home . On the plane my husband pulls two folded pieces of paper from his shirt pocket . One is clearly a bill , the other in my father 's handwriting turns out to be an invoice , too . " I guess these came in while we were away . " <p> The first is from my dentist . A bride needs bright teeth . The second in my father 's scrawl is for twenty dollars , numbers and letters . Shoes . One pair . <p> " So ? " I say . <p> " So , he figures they 're mine . " <p> My father gave me a budget for my trousseau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of teeth . One pair of shoes from Beck 's . <p> My husband laughs . <p> I look out the plane 's window feeling myself grow smaller . It 's a familiar feeling , this shrinking into nothingness . <p> My husband touches my shoulder . He leans , and he whispers . " Hey . It 's nothing . Really . I do n't mind . ' <p> One final lashing . I stuff the bills into my purse . " I 'm writing the check . " That 's the way it is . I have money of my own . Not much , but it 's mine. , I have a job I 'm heading to . <p> " Okay . " <p> " I mean it . " <p> " I said okay . " <p> 7 . <p> I am beginning my sixth month of pregnancy when my father calls to tell me Rose has died in her sleep .

I 'd wanted so much to introduce this new life I 'm carrying to Grandma Rose . In the chapel a young rabbi who has never met Rose describes her as a loving wife , a loving mother , a loving grandmother . He looks at my cousins ; he looks at me . Tears stream down my checks . I 'm trying to cry silently , but a sob escapes . I see Rose in my mind 's eye . She is dancing at my wedding the year before , wearing a blue dress , always blue to match her eyes , joining a circle on the dance floor , lifting her arms and dancing a hora . I broke the circle to dance with Rose . <p> Inside me , this baby kicks . I 've felt movement before , that watery turning , but this is the first swift kick , a kick so hard it seems to lodge under my ribs . It has lodged under my ribs . A knee ? A foot ?

It is June . The air smells sweet . Honeysuckle . The first roses . <p> Later , when the hearse pulls away from the curb , my uncle , my aunt , and my cousins follow in my uncle 's Buick , next is my father driving his white four-seater T-Bird , my mother sitting upright beside him . My husband and I do not join the procession . Philadelphia is a two-hour drive . I 've traveled enough . Grieved enough . <p> More than twenty-five years pass before I visit Rose 's grave . My son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes me there . He lives in Philadelphia , and I ca n't get past the irony of this young man , raised in Massachusetts , then New Hampshire , choosing a graduate school in Philadelphia , where he walks the same sidewalks Rose walked . He knows how to reach Adath Jeshurun , the cemetery where Rose is buried . We ride the subway , and when it surfaces , I look out at the shells of buildings gutted by fires , their windows empty and boarded up . Remnants of past riots . Are they left like that purposely ? Or because they can be ? <p> We leave the platform and walk through an inner city neighborhood . Years before this was a Jewish neighborhood . In a way , it still is . Jews are buried here , and the upkeep of the cemetery is guaranteed . Perpetual care . The grass is mowed and trimmed back from the paths . A large headstone marks the family plot .

The doctors called her attacks TIAs , Transient Ischemic Attacks , transient because a clot that lodges in an artery in her brain , time after time , causing her to lose use of her left leg , her left arm and hand , to lose her speech , passes through . Transient , but not benign . She walks with a limp and a cane . Her speech is impaired . She and my father , having joined that great migration from north to south , live in Florida , one of those places that offers independent living , then assisted living , and finally nursing care . <p> In the apartment , I help my mother undress .

Naked , my mother looks shrunken , lost inside her own skin , all of that loose flesh , bruises where needles entered her veins , more bruises on her legs . She no longer heals . It 's those blood-thinning drugs . So many drugs , so many illnesses . I hold her nightgown , then slide it over her frail body . She climbs up into bed . I perch beside her . Alone , we tell stories . My mother begins . " You know about Bob the butcher , do n't you ?

How old was he then , sixteen ? And filled to bursting with rage . And shame . I see my father . I see Rose . I see a cinch-waisted , ponytailed girl , racing up a flight of stairs . I see a child , looking up the length of her father 's trouser leg . " Me , too . Me , too . " <p> I know why my mother is telling my father 's secret . She wants " to make peace . " That 's her job , always has been . Stop it , both of you . Leo , say you 're sorry . Shelly , apologize . Yet , these days , my father and I hardly fight . We back off But , my mother is wise . She fears space , that large gulf between my father and me . What will happen if she dies ? Who will send my father cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will visit ? So she asks for my sympathy and my understanding . Not in words , our family does n't work that way . We tell stories . And this is what we have , what we all have , fictions to carry our truths . <p> " If it was n't for Rose and Bob , your father would 've finished college . He would 've become a dentist like his father . Rose failed him . " <p> I get the message . Do n't you fail him , too . <p> A key in the lock . My father 's footsteps in the hall , his frame filling the doorway . He is still a large man . " I 'm telling you , if it was n't for me , we never would 've gotten it through . They did n't want to do it . Did n't want to upset management . I said to them , We 're a board . That 's what we 're for . If we do n't upset management , who will ? ' " He glances at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream ? " <p> She shakes her head . " You ? " my mother says to me . <p> " No thanks . " <p> " Chocolate . It 's good , " my father says . " Have some . " <p> " Maybe later . " <p> " Later 's too late " <p> 9 . <p> I walk the white X painted onto the dark macadam , heel to toe , measuring . It 's quiet here this Sunday morning . No swish of cars . No rumble of trucks . No warning from a train 's whistle . I 'm sure , though , my father did n't skid , did n't try to step on the brake . If he had , he would 've gone sideways into the tall , tall grass and then the post where a black lettered sign announces the crossing . The sign is round , the background painted a bright yellow , black block letters filling the angles of an X-RAILROAD . <p> The land here is thick with undergrowth , scrub bushes , palmetto , coconut palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fronds . There are pines , evergreens , although I know they , too , lose their needles , and I 'm reminded that nothing is forever , not even old , old age . In the two years since my mother 's death , I have been a dutiful , if somewhat distant daughter . I 'd like to say my father and I learned to speak our minds , and in that way we reached peace . What we reached was a truce , a line drawn , protected by mined fields where we did n't walk . I visited twice a year . I sent gifts . My father , too , sent gifts . To me . To my sons . And that 's what he was doing that day , driving out to a grove , buying oranges to ship north . <p> I run my palm over the feathery tops of tall grasses , pulling a stalk , then chewing the sweet tender end , pacing , now the distance from signpost to tracks . There is no gate , but the warnings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinwheel , letters written on the crossbucks . The lights are dark , the color of port wine or old Chianti . I imagine them lighted and flashing , imagine my father 's foot bearing down hard on accelerator , trying to beat the train . He liked speed , that revved-up feeling , and I 'm reminded of a runaway horse all those years ago and of my father racing across a field of grass , reminded , too , of my own brushes with danger , the trees I climbed and fell out of , the mountain I skied in the Alps , losing my way , finally emerging after dark . That 's what that feeling did , it made you a hero ; it made you dead . <p> I look for clues , the mark of a tire , a piece of rubber blown out . The crossing itself is rough and uneven . I pick up a piece of glass . Not glass . Too thin . Easily flaked . Nothing but mica . I toss it away . Whatever was left of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the grit under my feet . What are the chances of car and train meeting like that ? Of life and death held in the balance of seconds or less ? Win or lose . One more dime on the number seven , slapped down on the wheel of fortune that Rose , my father , and I played , the three of us watching a metal tooth hit spokes , slow down , jump , and click , before it settled on a tiny black diamond in the center , the exact center , where it trembled , threatening to click into the red and onto number eight . Holding our breath , we watched it shiver , willing the barker to call out , " Number seven . Number seven , the winner here . Give the little lady choice of the stand . " <p> I walk along beside the tracks , a single pair of them riding a stone railroad bed , coming together , then disappearing . It is as if the glinting steel has reached an end , as if a train traveling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rails continue , I know that . The engineer knew . I imagine him blowing a whistle , pulling down on the chain of the brake , bringing an entire freight train to a screeching halt , but not before hitting my father 's car . Instantly . It 's what I 've been told . What I choose to believe . <p> I drive east toward the sea , a cardboard box covered with blue velvet sits beside me in the passenger 's seat . " Why buy an urn when you 're going to scatter the ashes anyway ? " the funeral direcfor said . He spoke the same words when my mother died . She is here , too . There is no Boardwalk , no pony track , no wheel of fortune . There are palm trees . There are benches . There is sand where I imagine Grandma Rose sitting in her metal beach chair , resting her elbows on the arms . She is the Rose I remember , wearing a one-piece turquoise suit , a wide-brimmed straw hat , cocked jauntily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry my father toward the sea . <p> Author Affiliation
