Top White House aide Karl Rove , who generally wo n't approve any flight that costs more than $500 , was waiting for his Southwest Airlines flight from Baltimore to Manchester , N.H. , to take off last week when he got a stunning BlackBerry message from his lawyer , Robert Luskin : " Fitzgerald Called . Case Over . " Patrick Fitzgerald , the special counsel investigating the leak of former CIA officer Valerie Plame 's identity , had sent a fax saying that absent any unexpected developments , he did not anticipate any criminal charges against Rove . The message to Luskin from Fitzgerald  --  who said nothing publicly  --  was an unrequired , if welcome , courtesy . Rove had been in suspense since at least February 2004 , when he made the first of five grand jury appearances . Luskin said the case , which continues with charges against former White House official I. Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby , had taken " an enormous toll " and that his client was relieved . <P> While in legal limbo , Rove , President Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a puckish but lower-profile warrior . But he marked his victory by telling Republicans in Manchester that Democrats favor " cutting and running " from Iraq  --  bold words to show that " the Architect , " as Bush has called him , is back to battle unencumbered at a time when the White House needs his strategic instincts more than ever . Bush said he " took a sigh of relief " at Fitzgerald 's decision and declared , " I trust Karl Rove . " White House chief of staff Josh Bolten endorses Rove 's renewed zeal , especially ahead of November 's midterm elections . " The tone that I want to set here is not one that shies away from partisanship where it 's appropriate , " Bolten said . " I believe it is very important that this White House be focused on success in the ' 06 elections  --  not for success 's sake , but because that 's how we can better ensure that the President is effective in pursuing his agenda .
