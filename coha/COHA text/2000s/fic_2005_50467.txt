On our message board , the subject comes up frequently of how to write a cover letter for a story submission . Perhaps one day Ms. Friesner will give a seminar on this subject , for in our Friesner file we find paragons of business correspondence such as , " Love ! Betrayal ! Frogs ! What more could you ask for ? ! " and the classic , " No animals were harmed in the writing of this story , though my cat is looking at me funny . " ( That one also noted that " As today marks my daughter 's twenty-first birthday , I return to nailing her shoes to the floor . " ) When Ms. Friesner dropped this new story in the mail , she noted " This time I would like to blame the British Museum , specifically their section on ancient Sumeria , as well as Larry Gonick , creator of The Cartoon History of the Universe , for his obvious-yet-overlooked observation that in any large gathering of people , there 's always some guy who has to be last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be first ? <p> THE DAY WAS HOT , THE SUN was merciless , but still the line stretched all the way from the Great King 's burial pit outside the walls , back through the city gates of Uruk , and almost to the base of the temple of Inanna . To either side of the causeway , soldiers in their full bronze-accented bib-andtucker stood stiffly on guard , simultaneously keeping the gawking riffraff at bay and the procession participants in line . From time to time the broiling rays of the great sun god , Lord Utu , would get the better of one of them and he 'd topple face-forward into the dust with a merry clang . That was the signal for a pair of young priests-in-training to scuttle out of nowhere , like scorpions in loincloths , and drag the unconscious man away , the gods alone knew where . " The pit , " said Namtar from his place at the very end of the line . " Trust me , that 's where he 'll wind up , the sorry onion-muncher . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and dutifully he moved with it . " The priests will say it 's a sign from the gods - and what is n't a sign from the gods , with them ? - a sign that the poor schmuck of a soldier was so overcome by grief at the loss of our beloved king that he wanted to go into the afterlife with him . The only thing the luckless loser really wanted was a cool drink of beer to take the heat off , but nothing like that would ever cross our priests " minds , no sir ! Not unless they 're the ones who 're thirsty . " The line moved again and Namtar shuffled along with it . " Shh ! " said the man ahead of him . " We 're not supposed to be talking . This is a solemn occasion . Kings do n't die every day . " " More 's the pity , " Namtar replied . A small , sharp realization having to do with the consequences attending the death of kings wrinkled its way across his brow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned . " More is the pity , damn it , and it 's all for myself . Why could n't that royal rat-kisser live forever ? Or at least long enough for me to die of old age first ? That lousy , stinking , miserable , selfish - " " You there ! " One of the guards along the roadside decided it was a good time to put on a show for the civilians . " You , the last one , be quiet ! " " Oh , I do n't think so , " Namtar said , shaking his head slowly . His towering ceremonial headdress with its clinking golden lozenges and sprays of bright feathers teetered shakily from even such a small movement . " Not just yet , Soldier Boy . I 'm going to talk all I like , while I 've still got the power . And what are you going to do about it ? Pull me out of this line ? Kill me ? " His laughter rang out over the roofs of Uruk , stiff and hollow as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to prove something , though he was a little foggy on the details concerning what that something might be and to whom he needed to prove it . Nevertheless : " Listen , slave , there 's worse things than death ! " " Are there now ? " Namtar 's dark face showed an affable smile . " In that case I suppose I should count myself lucky . Huzzah , huzzah , when I reach the end of this accursed procession , I 'm only going to die . What a treat ! Why , it 's such a stroke of good fortune that it 's too good for a mere slave like me . I am not worthy . Hey , I 'll tell you what , Soldier Boy : Let 's switch places , you and me . I 'll go off on a quest to find that fate worse than death you 're jabbering about and you go into the pit in my place and enjoy the full benefits of the Gilgamesh Early Retirement Plan for Slaves , Concubines , and Show Folk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , though - you look too arrogant to be a slave , you 'd probably fail the concubine physical , and as for being a royal entertainer , hmmm .... Tell you what , let me hear you sing a few verses of Love Me , Baby , Like a Sacred Temple Whore and then we 'll talk . " " Insolence ! " The young soldier leveled his spear at Namtar 's grinning face . " You bet your life , Soldier Boy , " Namtar replied . " How about punishing me for it ? Pull me out of this line and make me do something worse than lapping up a mouthful of hemlock and dying in the dark . That 'll teach me ! Make me go out into the wide world to brave unnatural dangers , fight monsters , defy the gods themselves , all that sort of legendary blah-blah . Funny thing : The royal dead guy in the pit was really big on perilous quests , but somehow he always managed to make it home alive . Fancy that . Oh well , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen his queen . " The soldier shouted something as obscene as it was ungrammatical and lunged for the slave , spear now aimed straight at the defiant fellow 's belly . Namtar did n't move . His provoking smirk had grown into a fullfledged grin of triumph . He was going to die , but he was going to do it on his terms . Under the circumstances , he was happy to claim his small victories where he found them . His grin faded the instant that a quartet of priests sprang from the sidelines , intercepted the soldier , and yanked the spear from his hands . The crowd cheered . It was n't that they 'd taken the slave 's side - they would have cheered just as lustily if the soldier had managed to skewer Namtar - they simply liked a good show . " Disgrace ! " the senior priest thundered at the shamefaced soldier . " Unspeakable piece of dog vomit , is this how you honor the passing of Lord Gilgamesh ? By diminishing his household for the afterlife ? For shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The soldier threw himself face down on the dusty causeway bricks at the senior priest 's feet , babbling excuses . The other three men-of-theloincloth looked to their leader , awaiting some sign as to what he desired them to do next . Meanwhile the procession took another few steps forward , leaving that small group of embroiled souls behind . This slight movement caught the senior priest 's eye and thus brought inspiration . His smile would have made a buzzard molt . " Behold , it is not fitting that we , who serve the ever-living gods , should soil our hands with the business of chastising mortals who are not employed in the city temples . We shall not punish you . " He watched carefully as the soldier 's whole body went slack with relief before adding : " For your disruption of Lord Gilgamesh 's funeral and your attempt to cheat our departed king of the full complement of servants he deserves in the afterlife , you are to take this man 's place in line so that Lord Gilgamesh himself may chastise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , and descend into the tomb with your master . Oh , and when you see him in the afterlife , be sure to tell him that Ziqarru and all the boys at the Enki temple say hello . " A heartbreaking groan broke from the condemned soldier 's lips . He shook in every limb like a victim of marsh fever and tried to dig his nails into the baked clay bricks of the royal road as if preparing to resist all efforts to drag him to his feet . He only succeeded in breaking his nails off to the quick . The chief priest looked at two other soldiers doing crowd control duty and nodded ever so slightly . It was enough . They almost trampled each other in their haste to haul their unlucky former comrade to his feet and drag him into his newly assigned spot at the end of the endof-the-line line . As for Namtar , he sighed and shuffled into place behind the soldier , only to feel the heavy hand of the senior priest drop onto his shoulder . " Not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what ? " A suspicion tickled the edges of Namtar 's mind , but he 'd lived as a slave long enough to know better than to entertain hope . Optimism was a luxury , most given to those who needed it least . " You 're out of the procession . This one is sent to Lord Gilgamesh in your place . Begone . " Namtar frowned and did n't move . It was n't that he did n't trust the priests ... well , all right , it was that he did n't trust the priests . He knew them too well to trust them . Their easy lives at the very top of the social ziggurat - which they shared grudgingly with the kings of Uruk - gave them plenty of leisure . In some , leisure breeds verse , art , great scientific discoveries ; in others , boredom and a subsequent taste for malice , just to stir things up . It was a deep shame that no one had seen fit to invent a Sumerian rhyming dictionary , or Uruk might have witnessed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're saying is that I can go ? " Namtar asked . The priest nodded . " Just like that . I 'm out of the parade , I do n't need to go into the royal tomb , no big sloshy bowl of liquid death to drink , that 's it ? " The priest nodded again , more vigorously . He had the piqued expression of a man who is being cross-examined in excruciating detail about the painfully obvious . " I do n't know where you come from , fool , but in my old neighborhood we know the meaning of begone . Must I spell it out for you ? Three triangles pointing right , two triangles pointing left on stems , two triangles pointing up without stems , four plain stems and a triangle pointing down : Begone ! And if you are worried about your status , give it no thought - I 'm sure you 're quite good at that . From this day , you are a free person . The man who took your place takes with it your designation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake the solemn rites to their foundations . " " Free ? " Namtar 's face beamed . " I 'm free ? Truly ? That 's very generous of you temple boys , giving away someone else 's property like that , even if he is dead . Not that I 'm complaining , " he added quickly . The senior priest sneered . " It is a matter of propriety , not generosity . The calculations as to the correct number of attendants to accompany Lord Gilgamesh to the afterlife were done in a painstaking , precise manner . Just as the wisest of our priesthood scan the night skies in order to glean wisdom from the movement and number of the stars , so too have they determined that there are certain mystic , sacred numbers here on Earth whose sovereignty must be respected in order for our unworthy rituals to please the gods . " " In other words , the tomb only sleeps thirty-two , " Namtar concluded . " And that 's not counting the horses . " He smiled . " Far be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm as begone as they come . " He walked off at a jaunty pace , pausing only once when he turned , pointed to his glittering headdress , and asked : " Do I get to keep the hat ? " A few sips later , as the bowl of hemlock drains , Namtar found himself sitting in a cool , familiar tavern , drinking from a clay jug full of thick , gritty beer through a battered bronze filtering straw . He had not been permitted to keep the hat ; such treasures were not to be squandered on riffraff . Still , he felt pretty good about the way his morning had turned out . Lord Gilgamesh 's ongoing funeral procession just outside the tavern 's open door might as well have been on the moon . " Another one here , Puabi ! " he called out to the beer woman . " Keep " em coming . I never knew that becoming a free man could make you work up a thirst . " The beer woman was a stocky , dish-faced creature with arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her tavern was the only one he frequented on those days when his late master permitted the royal slaves a taste of carefully controlled liberty . There had even been a time or two ( or seventeen ) when the pair of them had shared a satisfying measure of beer-fueled fleshly comfort during the Feast of Inanna , all quite amicable as far as casual orgiastic sex goes , though you would n't know it from the way Puabi was glowering at him now . She waddled over to Namtar 's table , a fresh jug of her best beer in hand , and slammed it down before him so hard that the clay cracked . Already fairly drunk , Namtar stared at the dribbling jug like a man in pain . " Oh , now that 's too bad , Puabi , " he cried , slurring his words slightly . " That 's a waste , a shameful waste of good beer . You should learn to be more careful . " " And you should learn to be grateful that I broke the jug on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes glittered with rage . " Drink up what 's left and get out of my house ! If you ever show your miserable face here again , I 'll smash it with a brick , see if I do n't ! " Namtar thought he understood why Puabi the beer woman was angry with him . " Look , darlin ' , it 's true that I ca n't pay for this round - Stupid priest did n't lemme keep the hat-but I 'm good for it . I 'm a free man now ! Whatever I earn , I keep . They were sending me along with Lord Gilgamesh as a spare pottery-maker , just in case one day the king says Hey ! I know I 'm dead , but I sure could use a dozen new drinking cups . You never know who 's going to drop by in the Land of Darkness and Ashes . It takes two experienced potters to fill a rush order like that , me and Ibi-Sin . Eh , Ibi can handle it . He was way ahead of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , getting a leg up on things . As for me , there 's always work for potters among the living , - I 'll get a job and pay you back before you know it ! " It was amazing how much pain a little thing like a bronze beer straw could inflict on the adult human body when wielded by the hands of a seasoned beer woman . By the time Namtar was able to open his eyes and uncurl ever so slightly from the fetal position he 'd assumed on the floor , Puabi had gotten her hands on another full jug of beer . She held it high overhead and it did n't take a temple mathematician to figure out that its intended trajectory had Namtar 's head for a target . " Wha- what did I say ? " The former slave clutched his skull protectively with both hands . Suddenly he was feeling far too sober for comfort . " Are you that stupid ? " the beer woman countered . " Yes , according to the priest who told me to begone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit like a camel . Several of the other tavern patrons ducked as the gob hit the far wall . " Do n't get me started on priests . Just because they are heartless , must we all be so ? Bah , but why am I chastising you ? " Slowly she lowered the jug . Rage left her face , leaving behind only weary helplessness . " You really do n't know what you 've done , do you ? I might as well blame a stool for keeping a priest 's rump out of the dung pile it deserves . The stool only does what it was made to do . You are no better than that . Get up . " She toed Namtar 's sandaled foot roughly . " I owe you an apology , but I 'll give you another beer instead . Only a fool tries pounding wisdom into a cabbage . " She waited only until Namtar was back in his seat before thrusting the beer jar at him and trudging off into the back room of the tavern . Namtar stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swallowed Puabi , and at the other customers . " Does anyone here know what that was all about ? " he asked , bewildered . " You 've got me there . " The man who spoke reeked of sheep . " Fun to watch , though . " The well-dressed merchant across from him at the little tavern table reached over and slapped his head . " Stupid shepherd ! " he snapped . " If you lived among civilized folk and had a wife who did n't bleat , you 'd know this is all about Puabi 's sister Sabit . " " And how should I know that ? " the shepherd said , cradling the side of his head and eyeing the merchant warily . " I 've only come into the city three days ago . " " Yes , and spent most of that time here , either propping up a table or snoring under it . " The merchant was apparently one of those people who are very good at looking down their noses at those they deem their social and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large nose for the purpose . " It was a good year for sheep and a bad one for beer out where I live , " the shepherd replied . " Can you blame me for wanting to drink up - I mean , to make up for lost time ? " " Perhaps if you spent a small share of that time using your ears instead of your gullet , you 'd have noticed that our hostess passed every one of those days either weeping as she worked or swearing sky-shaking oaths against Lord Gilgamesh , the priests , and every god and goddess Uruk harbors . " The shepherd shrugged . " I ca n't say I noticed . Women are always weeping or cursing about something . " This time the slap that rattled his teeth came from Namtar 's hand . Cursing and weeping , the shepherd gathered up his belongings and left the tavern . " Friend , what 's this you say ? " Namtar turned imploring eyes to the merchant , his fingers linked in an attitude of supplication . " Three days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . Why should his death make her curse and weep ? She loathed him ever since he took her little sister Sabit into his household as a - as a - " The words died on his lips . Suddenly Namtar understood . The merchant deigned to give the former slave a patronizing nod . " - as a royal handmaiden . As a favorite royal handmaiden . Which was why , when the time for Lord Gilgamesh 's funeral arrangements came - " " - the queen put Sabit 's name on the list of death-offerings ! " Namtar 's eyes went wide . " I thought I recognized her when we were all in the temple courtyard getting our jingly hats , but there was such a crowd , I was n't sure . Oh no . Poor Sabit . Poor Puabi . No wonder she hates me : I escaped her sister 's fate . " Namtar heaved a sigh that would have inspired envy in Enlil , god of the winds . The merchant smirked . " Oh , stop pretending that you care . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's been condemned in your place . If you 'd had the choice between saving your own life and saving Sabit 's , we both know what you 'd have done . " " That 's not so ! " Namtar cried with all the force of a man trying to out-shout the unpalatable truth . " I did n't even know Sabit was in line ! If I had known , I 'd have told the priests to spare her instead of me , I would ! She 's scarcely more than fifteen , poor child , and I 'm an old man pushing twenty-seven . The stupid priests and their holy numbers would have been satisfied , she 'd get to live , Puabi would rejoice , and - and - and - ! " He was spitting foam-flecks of indignation , waving his arms to all quarters of the tavern , and generally making a scene . The merchant observed all this with a speculative eye . At last Namtar subsided and said , " And none of that 's possible now . It 's too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral procession . Sabit must have drunk from the bowl of oblivion and gone to her doom by now . There 's nothing I can do about it . " Something scraped across the wooden tabletop . The merchant had shoved another clay jug toward Namtar . " Want to bet ? " he said . There was a sudden flash of green light , a wild wind like the breath of a thousand demons , and the goddess Inanna burst from her mortal disguise before the startled eyes of Puabi 's customers , most of whom fainted on the spot . Not so Namtar . He merely wet himself . The goddess 's nose twitched with distaste . " Mortals , " she said to no one in particular before swirling her rainbow-colored robes around the former slave and whisking him away . " Where are we ? " Namtar asked , peering into the darkness . " My sister 's realm , " Inanna replied . Namtar thought he discerned an almost human note of fear in the goddess 's voice . He was n't at all surprised : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover died , the goddess of love and war determined to bring him back from the land of the dead , a land ruled over by her sister Ereshkigal . Dressed in her finest robes , decked with her most precious ornaments , Inanna descended into the land of darkness , her dainty gold-sandaled feet itching to kick her sister 's butt and reclaim her man . But this was not to be . At every one of the many gateways barring the road to the dark lands of the dead , Inanna had been compelled by forces greater than her own godhood to give up her adornments and her garments , one after the other , until at last she came before Ereshkigal 's awful throne naked and helpless . Ereshkigal beheld Inanna brought before her in such lowly state and did what any sister worth her sibling rivalry would do : She killed her . But the ways of the gods are not the ways of men . Though the death of gods is sometimes unavoidable-whether to fulfill a prophecy , to respect some hidden rule of the cosmos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during temple services , or simply to make for a better story-it can also be a mere temporary inconvenience , like cat-sitting . Heavenly strings were pulled , divine deals were struck , and Inanna was brought back to life . Now she had returned to the land of the dead and she 'd brought Namtar with her . Why would the goddess of love and war come back so willingly to the scene of her most degrading defeat ? The former slave could n't figure it out if his life depended on it ( which he very much hoped it did not ) . " Radiant One , why have we come here ? " he asked , his voice trembling almost as much as his limbs . " To make things right , " Inanna replied . " Puabi the beer woman has always been one of my most devoted worshippers . Bringing her sister back from the dead is the least I can do for her . " " No , the least you can do is guarantee that her beer will never go sour . Bringing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do end of things . Meaning no disrespect , Radiant One , " he added quickly . " Even so , that fails to explain why I am here . " " Oh , you ? " The goddess was quite cheerful about it all . " I thought you knew . The senior priest explained it , or tried to . It 's that holy numbers thing . see ? " Namtar 's eyes had gone so wide it was impossible for him not to see . An icy finger of dread traced its way up his spine , around his throat , down the center of his chest , and did n't stop until he felt the contents of his kilt shriveling up like a bunch of grapes in a sandstorm . " You 've brought me here to swap my life for Sabit 's , " he said . The goddess patted him on the cheek and smiled . " Are n't you smart . Now do n't give me that look , dear heart : You yourself said you 'd have traded places with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too late ! " Namtar 's agonized cry rang out so loudly that it disturbed whole flocks of disembodied souls . The shadowy reaches of the underworld reverberated with the fluttering , chittering sound . Inanna 's face went pale . " Oh , wonderful , " she muttered . " That 's done it . Stupid mortal . I 'd hoped we could find Sabit and effect the trade quickly and quietly , no one the wiser , but now you 've gotten her attention . " There was no need to specify who Inanna meant by her . In the land of the dead , there could be only one : Souls flew up like dry leaves in a whirlwind before the coming of their grim and dire lady , Ereshkigal . Namtar cowered , but did not cover his eyes . The presence of Ereshkigal was awesome ; he could not look away . And why would he want to ? She was beautiful as only a goddess can be beautiful , with the same unsettling allure as the unknown reaches of the Southern Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was n't as beautiful as Inanna , but Namtar would not have rolled her off his sleeping mat for eating onions . Ereshkigal stood before her sister , the spirits of the dead clustering at her back , and pointed one hennaed finger at Inanna . " Who sent for you ! " she demanded . Inanna bit her lower lip and tried to hold onto some scrap of her divine dignity , but the tales told of her enforced sojourn in the netherworld were all true . She remembered every painful moment of that dreadful ordeal , excluding only her stint as a corpse . She threw herself facedown at Ereshkigal 's feet ; every particle of her glorious body seeming to thrum with the realization that perhaps coming here with only a scrawny mortal for an escort had not been one of her better ideas . Hands clapped over her head , she muttered something unintelligible . This did not satisfy her sister . " Answer , worm ! " she shouted . " Why have you come before me ? Have you done something stupid with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Namtar a cursory you've-got-to-be-kidding look before glaring at Inanna once more . " And why have you not come into my realm by the proper route , through the gates of passage ? You still have your ornaments , your garments , your - Ooooh , nice sandals . Can I try them on ? " Namtar watched while Ereshkigal stripped the golden sandals from her unprotesting sister 's feet . They were too small for her , which put her in-a fouler mood than before . Yet though Ereshkigal 's scowl was black as week-old blood , Namtar was suddenly no longer in the least afraid . A revelation came , akin to that which had possessed him back in the living world when he had defied the unlucky soldier . His spirit embraced the serene self-confidence that came not from bravery nor even bravado , but from the firm conviction that once again he had nothing whatsoever left to lose . I 'm already in the Land of Dust and Ashes , he thought . What more can this goddess do to me ? Send me to the Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this knowledge at his back , he stood tall and spoke up : " O Queen Ereshkigal , great lady of the dead , I am Namtar the potter . I am the one whose prayers invoked your sister , the goddess Inanna . It 's on my account that she has come before you . " Ereshkigal frowned . " A potter 's prayers ? That does n't sound like the sort of incentive to motivate my sister . Are you sure you 're just a potter ? " " Well , I used to be a royal slave too , but that more or less ended when Lord Gilgamesh died , " Namtar said , spreading his hands in a **27;2686;TOOLONG ? gesture . " Gilgamesh .... " No one could hissa name with more venom than the goddess of the dead . The very earth rumbled with her wrath . " Oh , it was indeed a great day when that unspeakable blowhard fell into my clutches . " She clenched her hands so tightly that they went from pale brown to bloodless white , just in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you were never too fond of him ? " the former slave inquired . " And I take you were never too bright ? " the goddess countered . " A curse upon the head of Gilgamesh ! He sought the means by which mortals might cheat me of my final due . He quested through the world in search of eternal life ! " Namtar noted that when Ereshkigal got really angry like that , little veins popped out across her forehead and blood flowed from her eyes . Wisely he decided not to mention this , in case the lady were sensitive about her appearance . Instead he replied , " True , but the important thing to bear in mind is that he did n't succeed . Oh , he found the Flower of Immortality , but much good that did him . The stupid ox set it down for a moment and a snake gobbled it right up ! And then he died - Lord Gilgamesh , not the snake - so that pretty much took him out of the questing game permanently . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O Queen of the Dead . " " The point is not that Gilgamesh failed in his quest . " Ereshkigal snarled like a dyspeptic lion . " The point is that he gave you lowly human slime ideas . He did not succeed in claiming immortality , but he was the first to try . It 's his fault that now the world teems with hordes of copycat mortals all convinced that perhaps one of them will succeed where he failed . Thanks to him , you miserable vermin have hope . You cling to it in life and some of you are still grasping the last few threads of it to your rotting bosoms when you descend into the Land of Dust and Ashes . Have you ever listened to some of those optimistic idiots ? They refuse to spend eternity quietly eating misery and drinking despair . Instead they wander through the shadows telling one another that this is just a temporary setback , that my realm is not endless , that my influence is not immortal , that a time and a day and a god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have even caught some of them fluttering here and there in the darkness singing - singing ! And if I ever lay hold of the jackass who buried that accursed harp-maker with all of those instruments and supplies enough to make more , I 'll kill - Er , I 'll tell him what I think of him . Hope ! Joy ! Harps ! Singing ! Is that any way to run an afterlife ? " Namtar clucked his tongue sympathetically . He even made so bold as to step up to the overwrought goddess and pat her on the shoulder . " I can see that we 've come to you at a bad time , " he said . " We 've overstayed our welcome . We do n't want to be a bother . Why do n't we just go ? " He tried to suit the action to the words , but it only took him a few steps before he remembered that he did n't know the way out . He returned to where Inanna still lay facedown in the dust and gently shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the right direction - " he began . Inanna sat up so fast that she sent Namtar tumbling . The same revelation that had given him courage apparently had made a second housecall , for the goddess of love and war looked ready to embody the latter . Divine thoughts are unreadable by mere mortals , yet Namtar believed he could tell that Inanna was thinking WAy am I so afraid of this bitch ? She already killed me once-true , it was kind of boring and smelly and did there have to be so many maggots up my nose ? - bull got better . If that 's all she 's got , it 's nowhere near enough to stop me ! " O my sister , waste no more of your time jawing with that unworthy mortal , " Inanna declared , clambering to her feet . " He lies like a dead donkey in the marketplace . Our coming here was none of his doing . As if I would heed the prayers of a mere potter , and a slave at that ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ereshkigal said . " But usually because you were stupid-in-love at the time . If you love him , of course you 'll answer his prayers . Prayers or not , someone I could mention will be spending a lot of time on her knees . " She uttered a nasty laugh . Inanna snorted . " Does that look like something I could love ? " She waved one hand at Namtar and did n't bother to conceal her scorn . " Hey ! " the potter protested , but the goddesses were no longer paying him any mind . Snide remarks by Ereshkigal were countered with personal attacks from Inanna and followed by simple name-calling on both sides . Unless Namtar missed his guess , the divine sisters were actually enjoying the mutual flinging of figurative sheep-poop . Muttering insults against them both , he shambled off to sit among the dead . When the goddesses ran out of slurs to heap upon one another , Inanna finally got down to the business of explaining the real reason why she 'd brought Namtar from Puabi 's tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome , can you believe it ? They saved the life of that puny creature and put the poor , darling , gorgeous soldier into the death line in his place . And for what ? For nothing ! Stupid priests .

" " You always did have a thing for men in uniform , " Ereshkigal said , chuckling . " Let me guess about this soldier of yours : Big spear ? " Inanna just licked her lips , which sent her sister into peals of laughter so freighted with obscene meaning as to make a bunny blush . " And it 's not fair , " the goddess of love and war went on . " It 's wasteful . I would have done something about it earlier , but I could n't just pluck him out of the royal funeral procession . " Ereshkigal nodded . " The mystic , sacred numbers . Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cosmos works , it had to be the bit about the mystic , sacred numbers . Talk about dumb luck ! " Namtar listened as the sister-goddesses jawed on . " So that 's it , " the potter muttered , drawing his knees up to his chin . " Puabi 's prayers my ass ; the celestial slut just wanted to get her paws on Soldier Boy . She was n't going to swap my life for Sabit 's at all ! " " You 're just figuring that out now ? " The words came from the gathered darkness at Namtar 's right hand and were so soft and airy that at first he was n't sure he 'd heard them . " Who 's there ? Who are you ? " he asked . It was a fair question . The inhabitants of Ereshkigal 's dreary realm retained no semblance of their discarded bodies . They were little more than winged shadows , gray as the ashes that were the goddess 's preferred medium for interior decoration . The shade in question oared its left wing rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and launched it with enough power to convey the impression of a light , companionable punch to Namtar 's upper arm . " Who do you think would want to strike up a chat with you down here , silly ? It 's me , Sabit . " " Ohhhh , Sabit . Of course , of course , now I recognize you . Why , I 'd know you anywhere . " As he offered up that gallant lie to the featureless shade beside him , Namtar rubbed the back of his head , a nervous gesture . " Er , Puabi says hello . " A giggle rippled through the winged ghost . " Puabi says nothing of the sort . My sister is crying her eyes out . She misses me terribly , she 's terrified that none of her customers will return to her tavern since Inanna staged that garish scene when she yanked you out of there , and she 's deeply sorry she did all of those ugly things to you with the beer straw . " " How do you know - ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabit 's shade intoned solemnly . Then she made a rude sound , though Namtar was damned if he could figure out how and with what she did it . " That 's what those stupid priests would say . The truth is , once you 're dead , the gods grant that the living world and all its secrets become an open clay tablet to you . And why not ? It 's not as though you can do anything with the information . " " So you know that I - ? " " - never would have volunteered to take my place in the death pit line ? Of course . " Sabit 's ghost gave Namtar another playful slap with her wing . " I 'd have done the same thing in your position , grabbed my life and run like wildfire through a barley field . Why would anyone sensible be in a hurry to come heieV As she spoke , Namtar noticed that a host of other shades was massing around Sabit 's winged spirit . A murmuring chorus of agreement arose from their throatless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the faint sound of gold lozenges jingling in a melancholy manner , the ghosts of the fancy hats that many of Lord Gilgamesh 's ill-starred household help had been given to wear into the tomb with him . " Ibi-Sin ? Is that you ? " Namtar inquired . It was an off chance , but he simply had to confirm his suspicions . " Yes , it 's me , " one of the other shades replied . It sounded miffed . " So this is how you come to join us , Namtar ? Late as usual , and out of uniform ; that always was your style . " " Ibi , we were slaves . We did n't have uniforms . " Namtar 's arguments cut no mud bricks with his former superior . Old Ibi-Sin had always been a bit of a pedant in potter 's clothing , a born lecturer who loved to hear himself hold forth . Death had in no wise affected this : " Whatever a person 's career or calling , among civilized folk there are always certain expectations connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the lowliest collector of night-soil to the Great King himself , we must do what our position requires of us , for that is what our fellow citizens anticipate we shall do . Even the gods must bow before the rule of anticipation , or we might as well go back to primordial chaos ! " " Look , it was that priest who took away my hat . Go blame him for single-handedly bringing back primordial chaos . " Ibi-Sin 's shade pulled the same stunt as Sabit 's , using his wing to throw an air-punch at Namtar , except there was nothing gentle or friendly about it . The wafted aether of the underworld smacked into the former slave 's breadbasket with the force of a charging ram , knocking him onto his rump . " Hey ! " Namtar protested . " What was that for ? " His vexation was short-lived , quickly replaced by a growing sense of alarm . Ibi-Sin and the rest of the shades surrounding him were giving off a distinct aura of malevolence . The waves of bitter resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't take a professional guts-reader to divine the cause . I 'm alive and they 're envious , Namtar thought . Fair enough . He stood up and began to back away . The menacing shades matched him , step for step , despite the fact that they lacked feet as well as faces . Namtar felt the chill seed of panic take root in his belly . It was clear he 'd made himself more than a score of enemies just by being alive when they were not . What would they do to him if he allowed himself to be overtaken ? He 'd heard that the dead had no power over the living , but was that simply another scrap of the priests " " wisdom , " irrefutable because it was unverifiable ? He 'd felt it when Sabit and Ibi-Sin sent those air-punches his way . What would happen if the whole complement of Team Gilgamesh made a concerted effort and lobbed a volley of them at his unprotected hide ? Namtar knew he 'd find out if he let the shades get close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a test case . He continued to retreat , never taking his eyes from the oncoming mass of angry shadows , until he bumped into something solid . " Where do you think you 're going , slave ? " The voice at Namtar 's back was not that of Inanna or Ereshkigal , unless the ladies had decided it would be good fun to become bass-baritones in order to mess with their worshippers " minds . Namtar turned his head and saw a being that was neither featureless shade nor gleaming god nor fleshly mortal like himself but a bit of all three . Below the neck , the insubstantial murk of an ordinary ghost had been given discernable form while from the neck up the apparition had a human face so perfectly preserved that Namtar had no trouble whatsoever in identifying it at once . " Lord Gilgamesh ! " he cried , automatically raising his hands in an attitude of homage that also came in handy for warding off blows . The spirit laughed , and laughter made his whole being shine so that the encroaching darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intimidating crowd of shades that had been backing Namtar into a nonexistent corner also withdrew a little before the light . Only Sabit 's soul , the solitary one in all that hostile mob that had not shared her fellows " anger and resentment , remained unmoved . " Greetings , O Namtar ! " The Great King 's cheerful voice seemed to fill Ereshkigal 's realm with its presence . " We missed you in the death pit . They sent along some other man in your place - a soldier , I think - but the priests already included more than enough soldiers and when it comes to making me a nice new set of clay drinking vessels , he 's worse than useless . " " Er , yes , well .... " Namtar rubbed the back of his head furiously . He did n't know which way to look for very shame . " What I mean to say is ... ca n't Ibi-Sin handle that ? " Gilgamesh laughed again , and again light filled the underworld . " There , there , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you see any taverns , any vintners ? What use do I have for drinking vessels now ? Or soldiers , harpers , huntsmen , or handmaidens , for that matter ? " He shook his head . " Stupid priests . They got the mystic , sacred numbers bit right and not a damned thing besides . Not that I notice them filling any of the places in my tomb with even one of their boys . " Namtar decided that this might not be the best time to deliver that **25;2715;TOOLONG message from the priest of Enki . Instead he said , " You 're , er , looking rather well for a man in your , um , present circumstances , O Great King . " Gilgamesh 's face was somewhat more than flesh , his hand was somewhat less , yet when he rested that misty extremity on Namtar 's shoulder , the former slave felt it . " We stand in a place where all former titles and honors mean nothing , Namtar . Here I am king of shadows , and shadows do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than Gilgamesh . " " Your pardon , O Great - O Gilgamesh , but the evidence of my eyes declares that you are something a good deal more than the rest of these shades . I mean , you 've still got a face and all . And they do seem to be showing you an appreciable measure of deference . " " Oh , that ? " Gilgamesh shrugged . " That would be the effect of the legends . My legends . They tend to add something to a person , something that clings to you even here . Not that it 's going to do me any real good in the long run . Sure , I 've got a face and I 'm glowing with numinous energy like a supernatural baboon 's bottom , but that and a disc of beaten silver will buy me a measure of wine . Which - did I mention ? - does n't exist down here . " Namtar did not see matters in quite the same light as the once-and-dead-now king . " If the legends that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O Gilgamesh , and if this light can keep the common shades at bay until I 'm safely gone , I will pour out a dozen measures of wine when I get home , see if I do n't . I 'd say that 's worth something . " Gilgamesh shook his head . " That 's worth a dozen wasted measures of wine and a small patch of damp earth . We spirits do not taste your mortal sacrifices . But I will still help you leave this place and return safely to Uruk . The goddess Inanna lied to you with all the powers of deceit that love and war have used since they were first created . My strength will fade as my legends do , but while I have that strength I will gladly use it to teach the bitch a lesson . " A shadow fell upon Gilgamesh and Namtar and all the shades that waited just beyond the dead king 's radiance . Inanna and Ereshkigal loomed over them , arms folded , brows drawn together in a pair of matching scowls . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister . " Oh , pooh , " said Inanna . " How much trouble can he be ? He 's still dead . If you give me permission to swap that mortal snippet for my beautiful soldier , what can the Great King of Nothing do about it ? " For answer , Ereshkigal waved her hand over the crowd of shades from Gilgamesh 's tomb , summoning forth one of their number . She then reached up to her glittering headdress of gold and jewels , the greatgrandpappy of all the jingly hats that had gone into the king 's death pit . Removing a flawless lozenge of finest lapis lazuli , the stone of heaven , she gave it to her sister . " Here , " she said . " This talisman gives its bearer the power to convey from my realm any spirit she desires , so long as she provides another soul to take its place . The spirit that you remove shall be reincarnated as soon as it emerges from the underworld , and it shall repossess the same physical form it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ereshkigal hastened to add : " Not right before death . Do n't worry , you wo n't get a man in the last throes of hemlock poisoning . He 'll be as alive and healthy as you could desire , and I am extremely insulted that you would even think I 'd pull such a sneaky trick . Do I look like a lawyer ? There 's the talisman , there 's the potter , there 's your soldier . Touch the talisman to the soldier , touch the potter with your free hand , and Humbaba 's your uncle : It 's done . " Inanna did n't have to be told twice : She thrust the lapis talisman at the soldier 's shade , glommed hold of Namtar before he could skedaddle , and chanted the esoteric invocation : " Come to Mama ! " Nothing happened . Inanna tried it a second time , and a second time nothing happened , though somehow it managed to happen more emphatically . The goddess of love and war gave her sister the stink-eye , but while Ereshkigal looked innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the lapis lozenge , the queen of the dead made a good show of shaking it violently , then setting it to her ear as though listening for something . " It 's running , " she said . " So there 's only one reason why it did n't work for you . " She pointed to where Namtar still stood backed up against the Great King of Uruk . " I told you that one was still trouble , dead or not . As long as the potter 's cozied up to Gilgamesh , he shares in the king 's heroic aura and it 's gumming up the works . Stupid legends : They get all over everything they touch , like honey . To the talisman , the potter smells the same as a real hero , and so it wo n't let you swap him for an ordinary mortal like your soldier ; it 's not an even trade . " Inanna was not amused . She turned her full attention on Namtar and said , " This is your first and only warning : Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Namtar , with the same measure of cold , calm determination he 'd exhibited much earlier that same day , shook his head slowly and replied : " So you can turn me into one of these unhappy shadows ? With respect , O Radiant One , go intimately know yourself . " It is said that the ensuing standoff lasted many days . There is no truth to this , but it makes for a better story . Just as well , for Namtar was mortal and would not have been able to survive a days-long confrontation without food or water , whereas Inanna had all eternity to wait him out . What actually happened was that Inanna , who did have all eternity , also had the attention span of a ferret . When her divine brand of bullying did n't work and the potter showed no signs of backing down and cooperating with her immediately , she frowned at him for about seven breaths , then flung down the lapis talisman and announced : " Bugger this . I 'll find another soldier for my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that , she vanished . Ereshkigal chortled . " I thought she 'd never leave . " The queen of the dead patted Namtar on the head . " You are a wonder , little man . I like your nerve . Perhaps the aura of heroism surrounding you is all your own . " " Great Queen , you do me too much honor . " Namtar held his hands high and bowed before Ereshkigal . " Never mistake stubbornness for valor . I am simply a man who knows that when Opportunity smiles , however shyly , you should spring upon her , carry her off , marry her , and leave her pregnant with your fourth child before even drawing breath to ask " Are you sure you 're smiling at me ? ' " The goddess laughed , and for once it was laughter untouched by that enforced irony brought on by rubbing elbows with so many corpses . " I will not make that mistake in future , O mortal man ! " she said , still grinning . Namtar smiled back and even gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Also I beg of you , Great Queen , not to mistake the mark of my sex for the inborn ability to find the proper road without asking directions . How do I get out of here ? " The goddess knelt beside the potter and caressed him with one cool , brown hand . " Must you go so soon ? " she crooned . " You vexed my sister so well ; I like that in a man . " " You never liked that in me , " Gilgamesh protested . " I defied Inanna too ! Back when I was alive , she wanted to sleep with me , but I said no . Right to her face , I said it ! She took a hideous vengeance for my defiance , but I confronted it boldly nonetheless and - " Ereshkigal gave him a disdainful look . " She took that hideous vengeance on your best friend , Enkidu . It 's so much easier to face the consequences of your actions when someone else 's life pays the forfeit . Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leaping into the grave with him . No , that was what set you off on your annoying little quest for the Flower of Immortality . You were scared of death , O Gilgamesh , absolutely terrified ! If you gave poor Enkidu a second thought all the while you were desperately seeking to save your own life , I 'll eat my hat ! And trust me , when you 're a goddess , lapis lazuli gives you gas . " Gilgamesh did not take any of this abuse lying down . He waded into the fray , calling Ereshkigal all manner of vile things , alternating these ad deam attacks with a spirited defense of his heroic record . Namtar found himself being edged away from the embroiled pair , ignored and sidelined once more . The trouble was , this time he knew that the sidelines teemed with the irate spirits of the dead from the Great King 's tomb . If they renewed their hostile intentions , he 'd be an air-battered lump of lifelessness long before Gilgamesh would notice . His best bet was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alas , Gilgamesh was one of those people who used their hands as readily as their tongues when caught up in the heat of an argument . The dead king of Uruk was gesturing to the four quarters of the underworld as he quarreled with Ereshkigal . Namtar understood that if he got too close while Gilgamesh was waving his arms around like that , the king might do with a single blow what the angry spirits would need all their concerted strength to accomplish . Namtar knew a lose-lose situation when he saw one . " I 'm never going to get out of here , " he muttered . " Not alive . What 's time to a goddess and a dead man ? They 'll argue on with never a thought for me until I perish of old age . This is all the fault of those stupid priests : They might as well have left me in line where I was . Much good their so-called mercy did me ! " He kicked the soil of the Land of Darkness and Ashes viciously . Something clinked against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something too large and solid to be ashes . Something went sailing through the air , a thing so vividly colored that its brilliant blue defied the all-encroaching darkness of Ereshkigal 's realm . Namtar made a beautiful dive and caught the lapis talisman before it could hit the ground again . He stood up , brushed ashes from his front , and was about to inform Ereshkigal that she 'd dropped something . A filmy wing shot up before his face . Sabit 's sweet voice sounded softly in his ear : " That is a very courteous thing to do , O Namtar , " she said . " It is also very stupid . " The former slave looked into the apparition 's featureless face , then down at the talisman in his hand . " Thank you , Sabit , " he said . " I would n't want to do anything stupid . People might mistake me for a priest . Now would you be able to show me the way back home ? " Sabit 's shade fairly shimmied with pleasure . " Walk this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " If I could walk that way , I would n't need the - Oh , never mind . " Namtar made haste to follow . The vengeful spirits from Lord Gilgamesh 's tomb tried to intercept him , but the residual glory of the Great King 's legend kept them at bay . The potter passed through their midst , offering these words in his wake : " Do n't worry , friends ! I shall return . " " Big deal , " the shade of Ibi-Sin muttered . " So does everyone . " ZIQARRU , SENIOR PRIEST of Enki , was feeling well pleased with himself . He had just had an excellent supper and was looking forward to an evening stroll . He loved these solitary perambulations , for it gave him the chance to bask in his own self-satisfaction over a day well spent . Today the senior priest had more than the usual reasons to take pride in his accomplishments : Lord Gilgamesh 's funeral would be the talk of Uruk for days . It had been flawlessly executed , as had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late royal master . Yes , there had been that trivial incident involving one of the slaves and a young soldier who really should have known better , but since it had taken place at the very back of the procession , not too many people had even noticed it happening . The dignity and authority of the priesthood was intact ; that was all that mattered . In keeping with that dignity and authority , Ziqarru donned a towering headdress of gold , carnelian , lapis , and jet before going out . It would n't do to have other casual strollers pass him by without knowing him for the great man he was . Ziqarru was making his jingly way around the walls of Uruk when a man stepped out of the shadows and into his path . There was something familiar about him , though the priest soon dismissed this niggling feeling in favor of pique when this upstart bit of spear-fodder refused to move aside . Unaccustomed to such insolence , Ziqarru determined to exert the full authority of Enforced Religion in order to teach him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priest declared . " Make way , lest your obvious lack of respect toward a priest of Enki shall single-handedly cause the city-wide onset of plague , murrain , boils , leprosy , the Egyptian pox , and the fall of Uruk itself ! It could happen . " The man merely smiled and reached behind him . Ziqarru stared : Was it his imagination , some trick of the failing light , or had the man 's hand vanished into a patch of darkness that was somehow ... denser than the oncoming dusk ? Before the priest of Enki could determined the answer , the fellow stretched out his other hand and - O the effrontery ! - grasped Ziqarru firmly by the wrist . " Tell Lord Gilgamesh that Sabit and all the folks from the death pit say hello , " the man said . With one last clink and tinkle from his fancy headdress , the priest vanished . In his place , a pretty girl wearing finery fit for the royal palace now drew the first sweet breath of life renewed . She threw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of thanks and promises . " No , no , think nothing of it , my pleasure , dear Sabit , " Namtar said , disentangling himself reluctantly from her arms . " Now why do n't you run along home to Puabi ? I 'll join you eventually , and I would n't say no to a nice jar of beer when I get there , but first things first : I 've still got thirty-one more spirits waiting for me to swap them back to life , you know . " " But where will you find thirty-one replacement - ? " Sabit began . Namtar turned a thoughtful gaze to where the great terraced temples of Uruk made their way skyward . " Oh , I 'm sure I 'll find them somewhere . " He smiled . " And I 'll even let them keep the hats . "
