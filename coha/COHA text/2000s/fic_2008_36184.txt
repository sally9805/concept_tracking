1950 <p> A man driving a new Chrysler automobile along a dirt road near the North Carolina mountain town of Cressler saw a boy up ahead , dressed in a black suit , white shirt , black tie , with a suitcase and valise by his feet . The boy was standing in front of a grocery store , thumbing a ride . <p> The man , working his way up , belonged to a crime outfit . He was now at the car-theft level , hungry for wealth and the tense excitement he found nowhere outside crime . <p> The boy was a twenty-year-old Bible salesman whose aunt raised him to be a Christian gentleman . He was hungry for adventure and good food . He had recently started reading the Bible on his own rather than as directed by his aunt and church elders , and he had n't been able to get past those first two chapters of Genesis-because they amazed and confused him . <p> The man thought he recognized something smart and businesslike in the boy 's stance-almost at attention-and he also sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out . He slowed and pulled over in the rising dust . If this one did n't seem promising , he 'd just let him out down the road . <p> The boy loaded his things into the backseat , closed the back door , bent his head forward , and folded into the front passenger seat . The man noticed the boy 's leftover belt end hanging down freely without being put through the first loop , his hair standing up on top in back . Maybe he wo n't so smart . <p> " Nice car , " said the boy . " ' Fifty Chrysler . " He reached out his hand . " I 'm Henry Dampier . " Henry was surprised at the man 's big hand . And he had big ears . He looked a little bit like Clark Gable , but without a mustache . <p> " Preston Clearwater , " said the man . " Where you headed ? " <p> " Anywhere south . Where it 's a little warmer . I came up here earlier than I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd shaved real close that morning , it looked like . He 'd have a dark beard if he grew it out . He was wearing cuff links , and Henry had never seen those except at a prom . <p> " I 'm selling Bibles , " said Henry . " But it 's too cold sleeping in warehouses and barns up in this high altitude . " He noticed how smoothly the car glided over the dirt road . " Where you headed ? " <p> " Winston-Salem , or maybe Charlotte-for tonight , anyway . " <p> The night before , Henry had sat up late in a deserted warehouse razoring out the front pages of new Bibles that had arrived in Cressler , general delivery-from Chicago-in a cardboard box . Each page said , " Complimentary Copy from the Chicago Bible Society . " <p> Henry looked at Mr. Clearwater 's hands . They were clean . " What line of work you in ? " <p> None of your goddamned business , thought Clearwater . " Car business , " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple . " Cigarette ? " <p> " Sure . " Henry had bought his first-ever pack of cigarettes only a few days earlier . <p> Clearwater pushed in the cigarette lighter . " Where you get your Bibles ? " <p> " Where do I get my Bibles ? " Henry looked at him . Could he know somehow ? " That 's kind of a long story . " He did want to tell about it-this idea he got from the fiddle player at Indian Springs in Cressler : instead of ordering Bibles and having to pay , why did n't he just go ahead and order a box from one of those places up north , or in Nashville , Tennessee , maybe , that gave away Bibles , tell them he had a bunch of sinners to give them to , razor out the pages that said they 're free , and sell them ? The fiddle player said he 'd had that idea when he thought about selling Bibles himself , but gave it up when his wife had twins and his mama died . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea anyway . <p> So Henry had been ordering a box of free Bibles about once a month , each from a different place so that nobody got suspicious . In the letter to them he kind of hinted that he was a preacher . But nobody got hurt , and in the end more people ended up reading the Bible , which was good , and now his billfold , his spare billfold-stashed in his suitcase-was considerably thick with money , somewhere between forty and fifty dollars , and some uncashed checks . He could go ahead and stay in a decent room for a change . And now here he was riding in a brand-new Chrysler . With a man who looked like he knew how to do things out in the world . <p> " This smells like a new car too , " said Henry . <p> " It 's pretty new . " <p> Henry noticed the ivory-looking knob on the end of the gearshift-he could n't quite see the top speed on the speedometer . " Six or eight ? " he asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's pretty good . So , do you sell cars ? " <p> " Yeah . " Clearwater , with his lips closed , passed his tongue over his front teeth . " I do that . " <p> Henry figured he 'd be quiet , give Mr. Clearwater a chance to kind of talk or not talk . He did n't want to chitchat himself into getting dropped off somewhere . <p> " Where you from ? " asked Clearwater . <p> " Simmons , North Carolina . Down east . " <p> " Is that anywhere close to McNeill and Swan Island ? " <p> " About an hour or so . I went there a few times when I was growing up . " <p> " I know some people there . Mitchells . " <p> " I do n't know any Mitchells down there . My uncle took us all there one time-me and my sister and aunt-to see this big dance hall that was one of the first places in North Carolina that used electricity fancylike . They showed movies on a screen set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . " <p> Clearwater 's boss , Blinky , owned a warehouse in McNeill that held some stolen army equipment . It was part of Blinky 's cover-a business called Johnson and Ball Construction and Industrial Machine Repair Company . <p> The drive to Winston-Salem would take three or four hours . Clearwater began to feel Henry out , learned that he was raised by his aunt and uncle . That his daddy got killed right after Henry was born , hit by a piece of timber sticking out from the back of a moving truck . That he was a Christian . That he liked baseball and had played on a church team coached by two men who worked at a funeral home and used baby caskets to hold the bases and other equipment . That he went to Bible-selling school instead of business school and was taught to sell Bibles by a man who walked back and forth in front of the class , chain-smoking cigarettes and coughing and telling funny stories . That he had an older sister named Caroline and an uncle he liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry did n't say it , Clearwater could sense he was a virgin , because of how he 'd talked around some stuff about women . That was good-it 'd help both of them stay out of woman trouble if he did hire him . <p> He also found out the boy knew when to shut up-when Clearwater was talking . Damned important . And he seemed to have an adequate sense of adventure without a too-big portion of carelessness . In fact , Clearwater felt a little bit lucky to have found this Henry Dampier . <p> Along about Wilkesboro , down out of the real mountains and into hilly country , Clearwater pulled over , stopped , and asked Henry to drive . <p> The boy was clearly happy to be behind the wheel of a car , and he was a good driver , kept his eye on the road , did n't go too fast , drove around holes . Clearwater talked some about his own service in the army , in France . He did n't tell Henry he 'd met Blinky there and that they-with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump trucks , a forklift , four jeeps , seven chain saws , and sixteen hundred pairs of aviator sunglasses . Blinky had them shipped to a warehouse in McNeill owned by his Aunt Thelma , the nonsuspecting wife of his dead uncle , Gabe Mitchell . He told Henry he 'd been to business school , but he did n't tell him that that had slowed him down and left him behind Blinky in the crime business-and now he was trying to catch up . He told him some stuff about his communist mama , who believed in Jesus . She believed the Indians were communists and that Jesus was a communist . Course you could n't talk about the communists now without somebody thinking you were one , Clearwater said , like he always said when he talked about his mama . And this Henry Dampier knew something about the Russians and Chinese and the atom bomb , more than he could say about some of the potential associates he 'd come across since he 'd turned loose his last one . And even though all that was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it , but this one seemed like he did , so Clearwater reckoned he was maybe gullible enough . <p> They stopped in Winston-Salem in the late afternoon , at the Sanderson Motel . Clearwater would pick up some " sheets " there-information , leads , suggested marks . He had a route that took him throughout the South , like any other traveling businessman . <p> " I need to do some work in town , " said Clearwater . " You go on in and get a room . It 's best if I do n't appear to be traveling with anybody . I can explain at breakfast . Right over there at Mae 's . " Mae 's had a big yellow sign on top of a small cafT . " I have a job available you might want . I 'll see you over there at seven-thirty ? " <p> " Yes sir . " <p> Blinky , from his cover-the Johnson and Ball Company in McNeill-provided the sheets . Most of his leads required reconnaissance , some required planning , and all thefts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the next day or two he 'd find a mark , make maps , decide alibis , and plan exactly how to use his new associate , if the boy took the job . An associate would certainly reduce his chances of getting caught . <p> The motel clerk , a little man with thick glasses , gave Henry a key and a flyswatter . On the counter was a wire display rack holding postcards , a color photograph of the motel on the front of each . Henry bought two . Displayed under a glass countertop were necklaces , rings , and packs of exotic cards . " How much is a pack of those cards ? " <p> " Twenty-five cents . I got some under the counter for fifty cents . Want to take a look ? " <p> " Maybe tomorrow . I 'll take that twenty-five-cent pack , though . " <p> In his room , Henry put his suitcase in a corner and his valise on the bed . An electric lamp made from an oil lamp stood on a chest of drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the chest top . Some burns had been sanded off , it looked like . He hung his suit and his sport coat on a wire hanger in the small closet , took off his shirt and undershirt and dropped them in a corner . He 'd wash them in the tub , do some ironing if they had an iron in the office . He looked in each dresser drawer . Top : empty . Middle : a book of matches . He pocketed it . Bottom : empty . <p> This prospect with Mr. Clearwater could get him into something a little higher up-well , not out of Bible selling altogether ; he did n't want that . He could keep selling Bibles on weekends , at least . <p> A full-length mirror leaned against the wall beside the dresser , bottom left corner broken off . He dropped his boxer shorts , kicked them into the corner , turned sideways , drew in his stomach , expanded his chest , clinched his fist , hardened his arm muscles . He turned and faced the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right . Checked his hangings . They always looked bigger in a mirror than when you looked down . <p> He stopped up the tub drain with the chained stopper and let the water run longer than he ever did at home . Aunt Dorie let him use only just enough water to reach the back of the tub . He stepped in and sat slowly . The water was hot . It had been almost two weeks since he 'd had a shower at a barbershop . He slid down so his head rested against the back of the tub and closed his eyes . He thought about this possible new job . Mr. Clearwater looked like he made a lot of money . <p> He wet and then soaped his head , neck , arms , under his arms , his chest and back , pushed his midsection up out of the water , soaped his hangings and the crack of his ass . He then slid down into the water , pushing his knees up , splashed water over his chest . He stuck fingers in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it there and shook it to rinse his hair . He sat up . The water was gray . He splashed water over himself some more , stood , stepped out onto a small , round rug , dried himself with the towel , wrapped it around his waist , walked back to the standing mirror , and looked at himself again . <p> He dressed in clean clothes from his suitcase . The white shirt was wrinkled , but the pants were n't too bad . He buckled his belt . He found his long black comb in the inside flap of his suitcase and combed his hair back while standing in front of the full-length mirror . Back at the sink he wet the washcloth , wrung it out , and smoothed down his hair . Like Uncle Jack . <p> What kind of job might it be ? Anybody driving a new Chrysler could probably pay a good salary-or worked for somebody who could . <p> It was four o'clock , not too late to sell a Bible or two and maybe get invited somewhere for supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of houses he 'd seen from the motel office . He carried his valise and , in his head , lessons from Mr. Fletcher . <p> My job is to teach you how to sell Bibles , gentlemen . Period . End of story . From an economic point of view there are two and only two sides to every customer encounter : making the sale or not making the sale . Economics is the invisible hand that moves the world . So : two sides-the head , the tail ; a sale , no sale . Kaput . The end . And you will squeeze every opportunity out of every moment of every customer encounter to make that sale . So now , gentlemen . Let 's start by writing down a definition of Bible selling . <p> Bible selling ... is the act ... of getting customers ... to behave in ways ... assumed ... to lead to ... Bible buying . Bible selling is the act of getting customers to behave in ways assumed to lead to Bible buying . <p> Let 's all read it together now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can promise you it will be one of the last statements you remember as you pass from this mortal realm into the next . <p> Bible selling is the act of <p> ... <p> He walked past three houses that did n't look inviting-dirt yards . Except one of the yards was raked . Next , after a short stretch of woods , three houses with lawns and shrubs sat back a ways from the road . He checked in his valise to be sure the Bibles were arranged , pulled out the box containing a Bible , walked up and knocked on the screen door . He heard steps . The inside door opened and a woman stood holding a cooking pot and a drying rag . <p> " How do you do , ma'am ? My name is Henry Dampier , and I have a little something in this box that is mighty nice that I 'd like to show you if you do n't mind . It 's something I think you might like-if I could step inside for a minute , maybe . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing today . My cat died this morning . I 'm behind on everything . I just got to washing and drying my dinner dishes . " <p> " Oh , mercy . That cat was probably just like a member of the family . " <p> " She was . She sure was . " The woman stood without moving , not much life in her face , her eyes . <p> You do <p> not <p> want to keep standing out there on the porch with the screen door between y'all . You want to get inside , and you do that by looking and talking in ways to make her like you in about ten seconds-that 's all you got . <p> " Oh Lord , " said Henry . " I remember when we buried Trixie , my uncle 's dog . It was all tears around the house when Trixie died . My sister especially . What was your cat 's name , ma'am ? " <p> " Bunny . I called her Bunny Rabbit . " <p> He saw that her hand which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm awful sorry . Did I introduce myself ? " It was a matter of seconds now . <p> " You did , but I done forgot your name . " <p> " Henry Dampier , ma'am . I tell you what , ma'am . Have you buried Bunny yet ? " <p> " No , I ai n't been able to bring myself to do it . Burt-Burt 's my husband-he 'll do it when he gets home . " <p> " I was going to offer to say a little prayer at Bunny 's grave . " <p> Sometimes , gentlemen , you 'll need to improvise . Jazz musicians do that when they put new notes where a melody used to be . They get off the beaten path , but brilliantwise . <p> " I 'd be happy , " said Henry , " just to step around back and bury her , if you got a shovel . I 'm very partial to cats . " <p> " Oh , that would be real nice , Mr. Dampier . " She stepped out onto the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't bring myself to do it , so I was going to wait until Burt got home . Bunny 's under the back steps . " They were slowly moving toward the porch steps . <p> " If you want to , " said Henry , " you can stay in the house and I 'll do it , if you 'll tell me a good place for a grave . I do n't believe I got your name-not that I really need to , but it 's always- " <p> " I 'm Martha Kelly . " She reached out her hand , and Henry took it . " Well , that would be real nice , " she said . " You can see her rear end out from under the steps . I just could n't bring myself to ... She 's over fifteen years old . Anywhere out in the edge of the woods would be good-straight back beyond the middle apple tree back there . The shovel is leaning against the back of the house . Lord , it 's been a blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child . Just ... just knock on the back door when you 're finished . Oh my goodness . Poor Bunny . Poor Bunny .
