Men used to follow me . They did . Honest to God . Right up out of the subway like rats following the Pied Piper . I know you 're looking at me and wondering , What the hell is she talking about ? She 's ordinary . She 's overweight . She 's old ! She 's panting as she climbs the subway steps . Fifty-four . Fifty-five . Fifty-six . How many steps does it take to kill a middle-aged woman ? Okay . In this ivory coat , I know I look like a jar of mayonnaise . I saw myself in a store window yesterday . I glanced fetchingly into the window and thought , What the hell is that ? It was n't always like this . In the early eighties , construction workers used to annoy me with obscenities . " Hey , baby , those forty Ds ya got ? " In the early eighties , I could sit between two fat people on the subway and still have room on either side . In the early eighties , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Okay . I know you 're saying , " Time passes . We get older every single second . Get used to it . " Believe me . I 'm trying . Rising from the subway , I view the world above , and sigh . Another Times Square morning . The neon signs blink on and off and on again . Except they 're not neon anymore . They 're TVs the size of the Parthenon . And diodes and readouts . The sky above Manhattan is that shade of blue pink that smells of New Jersey . And here I am , yet again , on my way to my job as an architect . I have been toiling at architecture for twenty-three years now . And lately , it 's as if I 've been pricked and all the juices have run out . It 's 1999 , and the architecture portion of my psyche is beginning to resemble beef jerky . Dried and cured . Idesign chains of banks , chains of supermarkets , chains of dry cleaners . I find myself tellingmy friends , Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know . " I have begun to think that if I ever was any good , I 've lost touch with it . I worry that perhaps creativity is the exclusive domain of the young . ( The majority of the people we hire these days were in diapers and banging their heads against the bars of their cribs in the early eighties . ) Walking down Broadway , I try to refute the power of youth . Great geniuses in later life ... ummm ... ( 1 ) Georgia O'Keeffe ; ( 2 ) Grandma Moses ; ( 3 ) George Burns . There must be more ... They were no longer juicy . Nobody followed them . And yet , look at the impact they made , so late in life ! Georgia O'Keeffe . Have you ever seen a picture of her in her later years ? She was beautiful . Beautiful as driftwood tossed for years in the surf . Character . She had character like nobody 's business . And George Burns . He still made movies till the end . He still made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake . And Grandma Moses . Well , I do n't know much about her . She became famous for painting like a child . Maybe she should n't count . A mother with two young girls is passing me in the opposite direction on Broadway . Oh , yes . I recognize her . That was me too . It 's only nine-forty-five A.M. and the girls , all blond and flyaway , are already sticky with purple lollipops . Their dark-haired mother looks haggard , worried , miserable . The girls are yanking her forward , their tongues and faces slathered with goofy grape . For one brief second , she catches my eye . The look she gives me is complex and affecting . On one hand , she is screeching for help ; on the other , she is smiling lopsidedly . " How funny that I should be at the mercy of all this , " her look says . " Me , Elise Farcus , once beautiful , once desired . These wonderful little girls . These sticky little lollipops . This is my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late eighties that was me . A woman with small children . Too tired to care that my breasts were nominally still pointing upward . Too involved with my twin daughters to feel sexual when men smiled at me , which they did less and less . Daniel , their father , never seemed to . In my twenties , I was desirable but insecure . In my thirties , I was covered with spit up or had toddler bags of Cheerios edging out my pockets , and living with a man who 'd lost all interest in sex with me , let alone romance . In my forties , I 'm free of all that : the toddlers are grown , the man is gone , but where the hell did my beauty go ? On this ordinary morning , this strikes me as a cruel joke . I pull my ivory coat around me , cross Broadway to my office building , just avoiding getting run down by a bicycle messenger with a whistle and a yellow jacket . He is free , this bike messenger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who he runs over . I , on the other hand , am an indentured servant . Indentured to my mortgage , my daughters ' private school tuition . I am about to walk up the steps to the plaza of my office building yet again , and then I stop . People pile up behind me , there in the middle of the sidewalk . I am shoved , cursed at . The crowd flows around me as if I were a rock in a stream . Still , I ca n't seem to move forward . It is a Thursday . An ordinary Thursday . Yet my office building looms like the monolith in 2001 . Frightening , ominous . Must I go there ? I have a bank drawing laid out on my computer likea patient on an operating table . But I simply ca n't move forward , or rather , I ca n't move forward up the stairs to Paramount Plaza . " Lady . What the hell you doin ' ? " " For Chrissake , move ! " It 's rather exciting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I ca n't go in . I really can't.
