<p> When Americans think about foreign policy , they often think in cycles . In 1952 an academic named Frank Klingberg divided America 's relations with the world into periods of " extroversion " and " introversion , " each lasting about a generation . After World War I , he noted , America turned inward , only to turn outward again after World War II . In 1974 another scholar , Michael Roskin , picked up the thread , arguing that Vietnam was pushing the pendulum back to isolationism . Sometime in the 1990s , he predicted , the pendulum might swing again . <p> Such theories , of course , lack social scientific rigor ; American foreign policy can not be set to a clock . But cyclical thinking still subtly frames much public discussion . For President Bush , the pendulum swung on Sept. 11 , 2001 , when a decade of introversion ended and the war on terrorism began . " After the shipwreck of communism , " Bush declared in his second inaugural address , " came years of relative quiet , years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a day of fire . " <p> It 's not hard to see why this framework appeals to Bush . It equates Bill Clinton with the head-in-the-sand isolationists of the 1930s and demoralized post-Vietnam leaders such as Jimmy Carter . And it makes Bush the heir of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman . But over four years after Sept. 11 and almost three years after the invasion of Iraq , Bush 's framework looks increasingly flawed . Historians glancing back at this period of American history will most likely see Sept. 11 not as the beginning of a new foreign policy cycle but as the apex of an old one . And it will be Iraq that marks the turning point  --  ushering in exactly the isolationist mood that Bush thinks disappeared on that " day of fire . " <p> To understand why , start where Roskin left off , in the mid-1970s . There 's no question that Vietnam sparked a dramatic shift in America 's mood . According to the Pew Research Center , the percentage of Americans who said America should " mind its own business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And among foreign policy elites , both Republican and Democratic , the change was just as stark  --  with Richard Nixon insisting that America 's regional allies , rather than the United States itself , carry the burden of containing the Soviet Union , and with Congress slashing both weapons systems and foreign aid . As David Broder wrote in 1975 , " Vietnam has left a rancid aftertaste that clings to almost every mention of direct military intervention . " <p> The isolationism of the 1970s powerfully shaped men such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , who cut their teeth in the Nixon and Ford administrations . And in contemporary conservative myth , the post-Vietnam introversion ended with the election of Ronald Reagan , who put America back on the offensive in the Cold War . <p> But that 's a misreading of history . In many ways the 1980s are better understood as a continuation of the introverted post-Vietnam spirit . It 's true that Reagan sharply boosted defense spending . But when it came to military intervention , the Vietnam hangover severely curtailed his actions . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised not to send American troops to Nicaragua or El Salvador , because the public remained viscerally hostile to any significant Third World intervention . He briefly sent Marines to Lebanon in 1982 , but withdrew them soon after terrorists attacked their barracks . In fact , by the end of Reagan 's first term , prominent conservatives were despairing over his timidity . He may have talked a good game , noted Commentary editor Norman Podhoretz in 1984 , but " in the use of military power , Mr. Reagan was much more restrained . . . in the face of serious opposition , he would usually back down . " <p> The real pendulum swing came not in 1981 but in 1991 , with the Persian Gulf War . America 's war for Kuwait had little in common with its war for South Vietnam : In the Gulf , the world was mostly on America 's side , the objective was clear and the terrain was favorable . Still , Vietnam dominated public debate in the months leading up to the war , far more than it would in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in Congress , the vote to authorize the war was far closer . In many ways the Gulf War perfectly illustrated the cyclical foreign policy theory : Only when the case for intervention grew overwhelmingly strong  --  as it had in the early 1940s and as it did again in the Gulf  --  did Americans close the door on an isolationist age . <p> From this perspective , the 1990s hardly look like years of sabbatical and repose . While it 's true that military and foreign aid spending declined after the Cold War , Bill Clinton was actually far more willing to send American troops overseas than was Ronald Reagan . From Haiti to Bosnia to Kosovo to East Timor , America 's military interventions were relatively minor but frequent . When Reagan bombed he was mostly criticized for not going far enough . <p> And despite an early stumble in Somalia , the interventionist consensus strengthened over time  --  with Clinton acting more aggressively in Kosovo than he had in Bosnia four years earlier and apologizing for not intervening in Rwanda , a country with virtually no strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Warren Christopher and national security adviser Anthony Lake  --  had been deeply influenced by Vietnam . But Christopher 's successor , Madeleine Albright , explicitly rejected the Vietnam template , declaring that " my mind-set is Munich , " and thus harking back to a previous interventionist age . <p> Obviously , Sept. 11 had a dramatic effect on U.S. foreign policy . But it did n't usher in an extrovert age so much as it intensified the one that already existed . Kosovo had bred optimism about the efficacy of American airpower when it was combined with local allies on the ground , and Afghanistan dramatically affirmed the same point . By late 2002 , when Americans debated the invasion of Iraq , the United States had completed three successful military interventions ( Bosnia , Kosovo and Afghanistan ) in the previous seven years . Confidence in America 's military capacities was at a historical high , and Vietnam  --  which saturated the Gulf War debate  --  was invoked far less frequently . Of course , many Americans still opposed the invasion , but in Congress the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case , which I supported , were weaker than they had been in 1991 . <p> In the past year or so , however , it has grown increasingly clear that while Sept. 11 merely intensified an old mood , Iraq is producing a new one . Public isolationism has jumped sharply since 2002 . Even more striking is the change in elite opinion . According to a recent Pew study , the percentage of security experts who say the United States should be highly assertive around the world has dropped from 75 percent in 1993 to 53 percent today . Among leading scientists and engineers , it has dropped from 55 percent to 32 percent . Among top religious leaders , it has fallen from 57 percent to 36 percent . <p> It 's not just that a growing number of politicians and commentators want to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq . Even beyond Iraq , the two hottest foreign policy issues of the moment are energy independence and a crackdown on immigration  --  both efforts to protect America from the world , not to transform it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has swung . From the Senate 's defeat of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 to the attack on the " imperial " presidency in the midst of Watergate and Vietnam , isolationist phases are marked by a reassertion of legislative prerogative . Dick Cheney picked up his mania for executive power in the mid-1970s , when Congress was feeling its oats  --  passing the War Powers Act , investigating the intelligence community and passing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . When Bush and Cheney came to power , they aggressively reasserted executive authority . And after Sept. 11 , Congress acted more like the Bush administration 's junior partner than an equal branch of government . Cabinet agencies brazenly ignored congressional requests for information , and in 2002 the White House virtually anointed Bill Frist as Senate majority leader . <p> But in the past six months , as both the country and Washington have grown more isolationist , Congress has come back to life . Disgruntled Republicans forced the White House to withdraw Harriet Miers 's nomination to the Supreme Court . Disgruntled Democrats suc- cessfully filibustered renewal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration huge legislative victories in its first four years in office , the House and Senate in 2005 spurned Social Security privatization , the centerpiece of Bush 's second-term domestic agenda . In the words of Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , " what you have seen is a Congress , which has been AWOL through intimidation or lack of unity , get off the sidelines and jump in with both feet . " For Cheney , who began his political career during the last assertion of congressional power , it must be an unhappy case of deja vu . <p> Is this swing of the pendulum something to celebrate ? Yes and no . To be sure , the Bush administration had grown dangerously unaccountable . Presidents must recognize the limits of their power , and so must America itself . But if history is any guide , there will be costs as well . In the years to come , if the isolationist mood deepens , future presidents may find themselves unable to act early and aggressively against foreign threats . At the end of his 1974 article , Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have learned the lessons of Vietnam too well . Perhaps by the 2010 and 2020s , they will have overlearned the lessons of Iraq . <p> The writer is editor of the New Republic and a monthly columnist for The Post .
