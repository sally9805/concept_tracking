<p> SAN FRANCISCO  --  When the Katy Independent School District near Houston recently sought a company to service 14,000 personal computers , it did n't expect to land amid a corporate tug of war . <p> First , No. 1 PC maker Dell Computer bid for the deal . Then No. 2 PC maker Hewlett-Packard swooped in and undercut Dell by more than $ 100,000 to grab the $ 3 million annual contract . <p> Punch . Counterpunch . High-tech 's latest heavyweight bout is a brutal fight . The new H-P , bulked up after its $ 19 billion takeover of Compaq Computer , the deft Dell , former champ IBM and struggling Sun Microsystems are slugging it out in a tilt that would leave even loquacious fight promoter Don King at a loss . <p> The 2-year-old tech recession has fostered the most aggressive pricing , competition and industry trash talking in years  --  especially between H-P and Dell . <p> Much more is at stake than inflated egos and bragging rights . Stunted growth in the PC market and anemic corporate spending on technology has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients , to swipe customers from one another to keep revenue growth up . Not since the early 1990s , when a tech recession threatened the likes of IBM , have new customers been so hard to come by . <p> " The PC industry has n't grown in three years . They can only compete on price , " says Silicon Valley venture capitalist Roger McNamee . <p> This is good news for companies and consumers , who are landing snazzier products at cheaper prices . <p> Desktop and laptop PC prices for Dell and H-P have dropped 11% and 10% , respectively , in the past year , says Beyen International Market Research . Prices of printers and bulked-up computers called servers have also dropped this year . <p> " Dell and H-P call us weekly with aggressive price and performance pitches , " says Steve Agnoli , chief information officer of Kirkpatrick &; Lockhart , one of the 50 largest law firms in the USA , with 700 attorneys . " We 're not complaining . " <p> Analysts predict the frenzied competition will lead to more consolidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The survivors are likely to soldier on with slower growth rates than during tech 's boom years in the 1990s and with a smaller influence on world stock markets and economic outlooks . <p> " There 's room for well-known companies to live with their . . . niches , but only room for two dominant forces  --  probably IBM and H-P , " says Fred Hoar , a longtime Silicon Valley executive , now a marketing professor at Santa Clara University . <p> Economists compare today 's computer industry with the auto industry in the 1920s . There were more than 100 U.S. automakers then , before consolidation narrowed the number to three . Ford Motor , like Dell in today 's PC market , gained an advantage by improving the production process . Chrysler  --  like H-P and Apple Computer  --  persevered through innovation . And General Motors , like IBM , acquired companies and offered quality service . <p> " The winners in any commodity business offer a comparative advantage , " says David Levine , a professor in the Haas School of Business at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies are in a pitched battle . Last month , H-P CEO Carly Fiorina stepped up the verbal jabs , speaking at a computer conference in Florida . <p> Of Dell : " They 're not a technology company  --  they 're a channel . " <p> Of IBM : " We 're winning against them 69% of the time " on strategic deals . <p> Of Sun : " They ca n't afford the research and development they need . " <p> IBM and Sun officials call Fiorina 's comments misguided , then turn on each other . Sun CEO Scott McNealy says companies that hire IBM 's services division are performing " a self-imposed lobotomy . " <p> " It 's an adversarial market . Companies not only tell consumers what they 're doing right , but what their competitors are doing wrong , " says Shahin Khan , chief competitive officer at Sun . <p> The companies are also quick to point out customers they win from each other . H-P says it has pried customers such as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce from IBM by contrasting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoffs at the characterization , dismissing H-P as " minor competition . " Big Blue recently scored big contracts with American Express ( $ 4 billion ) and software holding company Invensys ( $ 1 billion ) . <p> All-out war <p> Beyond stealing each other 's customers , the companies are being forced to branch into each others ' markets more often . Dell has been the most forceful , with recent moves into printers and handhelds . <p> Dell 's strategy of cutting costs  --  its operating expenses are roughly 10% of revenue compared with 22.5% at H-P  --  puts " enormous cost pressures " on competitors , says Mike Sheridan , a former Sun executive now at Mohr Davidow Ventures . <p> Eventually , such price gouging can be damaging . Packard Bell , which largely used low prices to become the USA 's biggest seller of home PCs in the 1990s , could n't turn a profit , and eventually sold out to NEC . It subsequently abandoned the U.S. market . <p> " You can only cut hardware prices so much , " Sheridan says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . " <p> Even customers , who stand to prosper from the price wars , agree . " Everybody is bidding down , " says Ed Wojciechowski , chief information officer of packaging firm Menasha . " But if a company bids too low to the point where it loses money , their service will probably suffer . " <p> H-P and Dell are the chief combatants . H-P has a new , feisty attitude . It has backed Fiorina 's tough talk with a leaner and meaner sales force and product line , sharper marketing and more incentives . " SWAT " teams of technical and marketing specialists prepare salespeople on price and performance comparisons with Dell , IBM , Sun and storage maker EMC . <p> H-P and Compaq made 85,000 products before the merger . This month , that will be 62,000  --  with the strongest products surviving . <p> Aggressive shutdowns of factories , layoffs and consolidation of suppliers have saved H-P $ 800 million since May , allowing it to shave PC prices to better compete with Dell . <p> Dell , meanwhile , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables it to undercut rivals , to enter more markets that have become price driven . <p> Dell 's foray into printers is what could have the biggest impact on H-P . Sales of printers , ink and other services account for nearly all H-P 's profit . If Dell starts a price war , H-P might have trouble using its printer business to subsidize its money-losing PC business , Dell officials say . <p> " We have a more efficient operation and a cost structure that is roughly half that of other companies in our industry , " Michael Dell says in an e-mail interview . " We do n't rely on forecasts . " <p> Though Dell 's strategy has been a winning one , tech analysts caution Dell could spread itself thin hunting for sales in so many markets . " Dell lacks innovation , which could hurt them , " says analyst Todd Kort of Gartner Dataquest . " Not everyone is fixated on price . They want features . " H-P 's $ 4 billion annual research budget , for instance , dwarfs Dell 's $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With so many heavyweights throwing punches , someone is bound to hit the canvas . So far , the biggest industry consolidation has occurred in PCs . <p> Since 1997 , AST Research has bitten the dust . Packard Bell NEC , Micron and Acer have faded . Toshiba retreated to the portable market . IBM largely ditched the consumer market . Apple Computer and Gateway are niche players . That leaves Dell and H-P . <p> The upscale server market has , so far , experienced less change . Among cheaper machines , Dell has made inroads at the expense of H-P , while IBM has stolen market share from Sun at the higher end . Sun , meanwhile , recently stepped up pressure on Dell by launching into lower-priced servers running the free Linux operating system . " H-P and Sun are vulnerable , " IDC analyst Vernon Turner says . <p> In printers , H-P is expected to continue to dominate despite Dell , says IDC tech analyst Angele Boyd , because Dell does n't have the product portfolio to overtake H-P . At risk : smaller printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in services with its one-stop shop approach . But that wo n't preclude H-P , EDS  --  even Dell  --  from carving out niches . <p> Says tech analyst Dan Niles of Lehman Bros. : " We 're seeing a battle on many fronts . "
