When Mark Fields became president of Mazda in December 1999 , he seemed like the kind of American who would try to bulldoze through Japan 's porcelain corporate culture  --  and slink home in frustration . A native New Yorker with a Harvard M.B.A. , he appeared slick , headstrong and inexperienced . At 38 he was Mazda 's youngest president ever  --  younger , in fact , than the average employee . He wore sharp suits ( and still does ) . He had a habit of speaking in marketing lingo ( which he no longer does ) . And like most foreigners in Japan , he committed the occasional faux pas . At one of his first dinners out with executives , he poured his own beer  --  a no-no among Japanese businessmen . <P> Yet Fields , who moved to Japan with his wife and two sons , proved adept at turning around an entrenched Japanese bureaucracy . Under his direction , Mazda was transformed from a floundering money loser to an automaker with net income of $66 million in its past fiscal year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive who led Nissan 's dramatic turnaround . Fields ' bosses at Ford , which owns a controlling stake in Mazda , were so impressed that they handed him a bigger job : turbocharging Ford 's troubled Premier Automotive Group ( PAG ) , made up of Aston Martin , Jaguar , Land Rover and Volvo . <P> This month Fields is scheduled to start working out of the group 's London headquarters . His mission : to increase PAG 's net income ninefold , from an estimated $250 million to $2.3 billion by 2006 . Achieving that goal will be no lay-up . With the exception of Jaguar  --  up 12%  --  PAG 's sales were anemic last year compared with those of BMW , Lexus and Mercedes-Benz , which sizzled with hot offerings . PAG 's sales are up so far this year , but its British vehicles still lag in quality : in the most recent " initial quality " survey by J.D. Power and Associates , Jaguar ranked 19th , behind Chevrolet and Pontiac ; and Land Rover , at 32nd , stood behind such econo-box makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his magic mostly by boosting efficiency and trimming costs through further sharing of parts and platforms across the brands  --  without jeopardizing each one 's purebred appeal . <P> Is Fields up to the task ? He certainly conveys a zoom-zoom work ethic . A graduate of Rutgers University with an economics degree , he usually hits the office by 6 a.m. and closes his days with 10 p.m. weight lifting and a two-mile run . He likes to drive fast too . At Mazda he skipped the chauffeur service in favor of a red RX-7 sports car . At PAG , though , he says he will forgo the Aston Martin : " We need to look for every efficiency , and driving an Aston would n't set a good example . " <P> Fields comes with a reputation as a cost cutter and fix-it guy . Before taking over Mazda , he spent two years in Argentina restoring a troubled Ford operation to profitability . At Mazda , where he started as sales and marketing senior adviser , he found a remarkably inefficient bureaucracy . Shortly after arriving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days later , a tome the size of the New York City phone book , and about as illuminating , appeared on his desk . " Its conclusions were severely lacking , " Fields says . " Our investment bankers knew more about our business than some of our directors . "
