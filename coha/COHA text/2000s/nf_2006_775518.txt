Introduction // Hey , ya 'll ! In my last cookbook , Paula Deen &amp; Friends , I introduced ya 'll to a few of my girlfriends because I wanted them to share with ya 'll how they put together menus for entertaining . In this book , I want to share with ya 'll how I celebrate holidays and special occasions at my house along with my family . I need to tell ya up front that my first preference for entertaining is definitely casual , but that 's not to say that when the old girl has to , she ca n't put on the dog . // When Michael and I were planning our dream house on Turner 's Creek , on Wilmington Island near Savannah , we wanted our home to be inviting . I wanted all my guests to feel like they were being embraced when they came in . I really love large rooms , and fewer of them , rather than a lot of smaller rooms . Our downstairs consists of our master bedroom and bathroom and walk-in closet , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a foyer , and a huge kitchen that has two farmhouse tables in it . At one end is an antique table that seats twelve people ; at the other end is a small table that seats four people . Michael and I sit at the smaller table when it 's just the two of us , and when we have family and friends in , we go to the long table . // When Michael and I were building our kitchen , there were a few things that we just did n't want to do without . I had become so accustomed to commercial deep fryers in the restaurants that I felt like I just could n't have a kitchen without one of those . I also felt like I could n't cook without a convection oven like the ones we used in the restaurants . So , into my kitchen went two commercial pieces  --  the big convection oven and the deep fryer . I have a five-burner drop-in cooktop on my island , and then under the ventihood , I have another four burners , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family over and I 'm making pancakes or grilling sandwiches . So , I have really made my kitchen very user-friendly , and the way my kitchen is set up , a lot of us can get in there at the same time and we 're not stepping on each other . // Outside , we have Michael 's smokehouse  --  really an open-air kitchen . It 's got all of his barbecue grills , and a long counter for holding lots of food and lots of dishes . We like to throw Low-Country boils there , and barbecue our chickens , grill briskets , cook steak , and smoke ribs . We always like company around us because we 've found it 's easier to cook for a crowd than to cook for just the two of us . Inside or out , I love to celebrate with family and friends and just stand around and chitchat and cook . And there 's just nothing like cookin ' and eatin ' out by that water . It just gives you a huge appetite . // The important thing to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want ya 'll to feel like you were seeing recipes that you had seen over and over and over again . Of course you 'll find my favorites , but at the same time I wanted to give ya 'll fresh , new recipes to add to your files . You know , there are so many different ways to update and freshen up recipes and I 've said so many times , " A recipe is truly only a starting point . " So , when it was time to start on this book , it was only natural that I would turn to my friend Martha Nesbit . Martha and I had worked on Paula Deen &amp; Friends : Living It Up , things , and Martha 's been testing recipes for twenty-five years . I know her and I trust her . She has taken my favorites , like my chicken potpie , and she 's made sure the recipes will work in your kitchen for you just like they work in my kitchen for me ' cause you know that I do have a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and by the time I get through with it , I do n't know what 's in it ! // For ideas for decorating for my parties , I turned to my personal assistant , Brandon Branch . Brandon has a degree in horticulture from Mississippi State University , and he is the creative director for Cooking with Paula Deen magazine and the art director/prop stylist for Paula 's Home Cooking and Paula 's Party , both Food Network productions . Brandon also did the flowers for my wedding , for Jamie ( Deen ) and Brooke 's wedding , and for Michelle ( Groover ) and Daniel Reed 's wedding . Brandon and I are very , very close ; we work very closely together , and he knows what I like . I just know you 'll love his decorating tips . // Each celebration seemed to evoke a message , and I decided to share my thoughts with ya 'll and call them " Paula 's Pearls of Wisdom . " I hope that maybe some of these Pearls will pop into your mind at the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning this book , it was only natural that I turned to the men in my life to get their opinions as to what they consider my celebration food . I was so touched when I found out what they thought because I feel the exact same way  --  a celebration with your family does n't have to mean a national holiday . In my house , a celebration can be something as simple as everybody being off from work at the same time . I have a daughter who is a nurse and one son who is home one week and works one week , and there 's no juggling those kinds of schedules . // So , anyway , why do n't we stop all the chitchat and get to cooking , ' cause we 've got a lot to celebrate ! Ya 'll have fun , and , as always , I send you best dishes and love from my kitchen to yours . // Paula Deen // July 2006 //                  @ @ @
