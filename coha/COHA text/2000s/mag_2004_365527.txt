It 's a buying frenzy . A desire to boost earnings with new retail customers , combined with a general pickup in mergers and acquisitions , has rekindled a decades-old trend of bank consolidation . The banking industry has announced $114 billion worth of M &A's; so far this year , including the $58 billion blockbuster that brought together <P> Bank One and J.P . Morgan Chase . Now the pairings are trickling down the asset chain . In late August Citigroup said it was buying its way into retail banking in Texas by acquiring privately held First American Bank . Two days later , Canada 's Toronto-Dominion Bank announced it would spend $3.8 billion for 51% of Banknorth Group , based in Portland , Maine , which is itself expanding southward by acquisition . <P> While the jury is still out on how consolidation will affect consumers , it 's clear that merger mania means opportunity for stock pickers savvy enough to bet on the next bank to get scooped up . When word of a takeover gets out , shareholders almost always see a pop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's the million-dollar question , " says John McCune , research director at SNL Financial in Charlottesville , Va . <P> One way to narrow the field is to look for markets primed for consolidation . Texas is booming with cross-border business but remains a fragmented market . When Citigroup was circling before it grabbed First American , the rumor was that either Houston-based Southwest Bancorporation of Texas or Texas Regional Bancshares , based in McAllen , Texas , might get poached .

The idea is to seek out ratios that are lower than those of other banks ; this indicates that the companies are " cheap " and more likely to be bought . A buying bank typically pays 2 to 2 1/2 times book value when acquiring another company , so look for a price-to-book ratio below 2 . Look for companies growing close to their price-to-earnings ratios . Many banks have forward P/E ratios in the teens ( the average is 12 1/2 times earnings for regional banks ) , though not many grow in the double digits . Focus on banks with price-to-earnings-growth ( PEG ) ratios closer to 1 . <P> And do n't forget that if the bank does n't get bought , you 'll still own it . So seek solid management , not too much reliance on mortgage lending ( since interest rates are rising ) and a healthy dividend payout ratio ( dividends paid divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry .
