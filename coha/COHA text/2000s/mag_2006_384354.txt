We test the audio quality and evaluate the usability of flash players , and pick a Best Buy . // AUDIO PLAYERS TEST Center PORTABLE AUDIO players may offer eye-catching features , such as the ability to display photos and video clips , but ultimately the devices must be judged by one thing : How good does the music sound ? For the first time , the PC World Test Center has conducted sound-quality tests on audio players to determine which produce the finest sound . For details about these tests , see the audio players section of " How We Test " at find.pcworld.com/53160 . Lightweight audio players with flash-based memory are the best choice for listening to music while at the gym or on the go . Their lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to drops than hard-drive-based devices are . And if you do n't require that your audio player hold your entire music collection ( or if you already have a bulky player that stores it all ) , one of these small flash players makes the perfect traveling companion . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models , flash players have increased their storage space . A 4GB flash player will hold about 1000 MP3s encoded at 128 kilobits per second . If you want an armband for listening on the move , however , note that Creative 's Zen Nano Plus has one , but the iPod Nano 's costs $29 extra . Flash players come in a mix of shapes and sizes-variables that can impact their usability . There is such a thing as too small . Some of the players we evaluated are about the size of a cigarette lighter ( too small and narrow to include a thumb wheel ) . On the other hand , some rectangular models have room for a larger screen , making navigating their menus easier . The lightest player we tested is the 2GB MobiBlu DAH0 - 1500i ( also known as the " Cube " ) . The unit weighs less than an ounce and is so small you could pop it in your mouth . Despite this novelty , it missed the chart due to its lack of features and mediocre usability . Photograph CREATIVE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pricier iPod Nano . Dell 's DJ Ditty costs just $89. // NEW AUDIO TESTS BEGINNING WITH THIS issue , the PC World Test Center will evaluate the sound quality of audio players using an ATS-2 analyzer provided by Audio Precision , a maker of audio testing equipment . We conducted several tests on each player . For example , we measured the output level each device could attain before reaching 1 percent distortion , generally regarded as the highest acceptable amount . Photograph // We also measured each device 's frequency response to ensure that the player could reproduce very high and very low frequencies . All of the players we evaluated earned high scores on this test . We also measured the signal-to-noise ratio and the harmonic distortion of each player 's audio output ; obviously , noise or distortion will make your listening less enjoyable . // Our tests measure the audio output from each player 's headphone jack , rather than from the included earbuds . To get the best possible sound quality , you 'll want to upgrade from the basic earbuds that come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " First Things First : Ditch the Earbuds " on page 54 . We were particularly unimpressed with the Creative Zen Nano Plus 's earbuds , which is a shame because the player 's audio quality is top-notch . Only the Zen Nano Plus and the iPod Nano received a score of Superior for overall audio quality . That and a low price earned the Zen Nano Plus our Best Buy . However , no other player tops the elegant design of the iPod Nano . Of the players on the chart , the SanDisk Sansa clSOadded the most distortion to audio , and the SanDisk Sansa e260 posted the highest signal-tonoise ratio . Two players , the Creative Zen Nano Plus and the Dell D Ditty , tied for creating the least distortion . If you like to crank up the tunes , the iPod Nano is your best bet : In our tests it generated the loudest signal before reaching 1 percent distortion . It also showed the best frequency response , re-creating frequencies across the spectrum with less variance than the other players did . The iPod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurement of cross talk-the blending of the left and right audio channels , which degrades the stereo image . The Creative Zen Nano Plus got the best score on this test . Photograph SANDISK 'S SANSA E260 ( left ) earned the lowest audio quality score ; the c150 fared better . // FM AND RECORDING ALL THE PLAYERS WE tested , except the iPod Nano , include an FM tuner . Three-the Creative Zen Nano Plus , as well as the SanDisk c150 and e260 players-can record FM broadcasts . Do n't expect the tuners in these small players to get the crisp reception you get from your car stereo or to make pristine recordings of radio shows , however ; recordings we made with the SanDisk e260 had more static than the original broadcast . Most players typically store 20 radio station presets . The Creative Zen Nano Plus can store 32 presets , while the Dell DJ Ditty allows you to store just 10 . As for equalizer settings , the iPod Nano offers the most , with 22 EQ presets . Aside from the Dell DJ Ditty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we looked at offer between 4 and 8 settings . In our experience , however , using an audio player 's EQ lowers the output level and distorts the signal . A built-in microphone is handy for recording voice memos . Among the models we tested , only the iPod Nano and Dell DJ Ditty lacked a mike . One convenient feature of the Creative Zen Nano Plus is that in addition to its built-in mike , it has a line-in jack you can use to record from , say , a portable CD player . BATTERIES SOME FLASH PLAYERS use batteries that you can replace yourself . The Zen Nano Plus and SanDisk Sansa clSO use one AAA battery . Both the SanDisk Sansa e260 and iPod Nano run on a rechargeable lithium ion battery ; you can change the Sansa e260 's battery yourself , but not the iPod Nano 's , nor the lithium polymer battery in the Dell DJ Ditty . All of the players on the chart are rated to last at least 14 hours on one charge . SHOPPING FOR TUNES THE IPOD NANO is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag and drop music files onto it using Windows Explorer-you 're required to use Apple 's iTunes software . Most of the players on the chart support the Rhapsody , Napster , and Yahoo online music stores . With the iPod Nano , you have to shop at Apple 's iTunes Music Store . Support for music subscription services is a slightly different story . All of the players except the iPod Nano carry Microsoft 's PlaysForSure logo . But be aware that the Creative Zen Nano Plus supports only downloads under the system , and not subscription services as the other three players do . A list of compatible devices is available at www.playsforsure.com . PHOTOS , TOO A FEW OF the players can display photos on their color screen . The iPod Nano 's 1.5-inch screen and the SanDisk e260 's 1.8-inch screen are big enough to make photo viewing fun ( in theory anyway ) . However , you ca n't drag and drop photos onto either player . To view photos on the iPod Nano you have to use iTunes , and with the Sansa e260 you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for playing video ( the Sansa e260 is the only player here that does so ) . In practice , the e260 's large screen is wasted real estate : Photos we loaded left about half of the screen blank , and the PDF . manual offered no help . On the Sansa c150 's 1.2-inch color screen , photos displayed smaller than a postage stamp . Such multimedia features are merely extras on flashbased players , though . What these devices do best is play music . So choose one , and get out and enjoy yourself ! - Eric Butterfield <p>
