A mountain pass on Pakistan 's northern border <p> <p> <p> A battered Russian jeep topped a rock-strewn rise . Above ten thousand feet , even this high mountain pass was dominated by snow-covered peaks towering in every direction . <p> <p> Behind the wheel , Sergey Lysenko stopped the jeep , got out with a pair of Steiner mil specs binoculars , and glassed the rugged valley two thousand feet below . <p> <p> At first he saw nothing . No movement , no signs that any human had been here in a millennium , in ten thousand millennia . These were the Hindu Kush , the tallest mountains on earth . But Lysenko , a Chechen-Russian by birth , raised and educated in London , was a patient man . Here on the border with Afghanistan , where there was no rule of law , save one  --  al-Quaeda  --  it paid to be careful , to be deliberate , to be smart . <p> <p> He was forty-one , just under six feet , dark with short-cropped steel gray hair and deep-set eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A non-practicing Muslim , he was nonetheless bin Laden 's main conduit to the west and a dedicated jihadist , though not a fanatic . Women in London found his weathered face and probing eyes dangerously exciting . He could have passed for a desert nomad , a Bedouin . He was a man who never questioned himself . <p> <p> After five minutes he was rewarded with a tiny flash of light from below , probably the reflection off the lenses of a pair of binoculars , or from a riflescope . Bin Laden 's entourage was always cautious . <p> <p> I have arrived , he had told them by stopping . <p> <p> And they had replied , Ay-wa , yes , we see you . <p> <p> He tossed the binoculars on the passenger seat , got behind the wheel , and drove the rest of the way down into the valley . He was conscious of a hundred pairs of eyes on him : Kalashnikovs , RPGs , and 7.62mm Russian-made Dragunov sniper rifles following his progress . <p> <p> At the bottom he parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep , keeping his hands in plain sight . He was dressed in Russian Spetsnaz camos , and was unarmed except for a Heckler &amp; Koch room broom submachine gun and a 9mm Steyr GB automatic pistol in the Gazik . He 'd been given these weapons , plus his clothing , at Peshawar before flying on to Chitral , Pakistan 's most northerly airstrip , where he 'd picked up the Jeep . <p> <p> A pair of mujahideen armed with Kalashnikovs stepped out from behind a big boulder about twenty feet above the camouflage net and watched as Lysenko came up the steep slope . <p> <p> When he reached them they stepped aside . " May Allah be with you , " one of them said . <p> <p> " And with you , " Lysenko replied in Saudi Arabic , although it was all stupid mumbo jumbo as far as he was concerned . His passion was killing and not some useless religion . Sometimes he would stop to wonder what , if anything , he did believe in , other than his own survival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , where his boarding school had taught him how to hate . <p> <p> The entrance to bin Laden 's cave complex opened behind the ten-foot-tall rock . Lysenko climbed past the guards and ducked inside . Immediately he could smell the distinctive odors of electronic equipment , and something unpleasant  --  perhaps mold . This sort of a place was never meant as a refuge for very long , yet bin Laden and his loyalists had been living in mountain caves since before 9/11 . Living like animals ; the thought came to Lysenko as it did each time he came here . <p> <p> Fifteen meters in , Lysenko felt a chill as he passed through a low opening , on the other side of which was a fairly large chamber , perhaps eight or ten meters on a side . Persian rugs were scattered on the dirt floor , halogen desk lamps illuminating single sideband radios , weather fax machines , and laptops , one of which was streaming Al Jazeera , the television network from Qatar , and another a CNN feed from London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy at the machinery and did n't bother to look up as Lysenko walked by . <p> <p> Here al-Quaeda was connected to the world , and anyone who did n't belong could never get this close . <p> <p> Three chambers farther into the complex , Lysenko ducked through another opening , this one into an even larger room , the floor and the walls carpeted . <p> <p> Osama bin Laden , his legs folded under him , was seated on cushions in front of a low table , two young mujahideen on either side looking fierce with Kalashnikov rifles clutched against their chests , pistols stuck in their belts . They stiffened and pointed their rifles at Lysenko . <p> <p> " It 's all right , my children , " bin Laden said softly . He was gaunt , his eyes sunken , his face pale , beard and hair pure white now . When he raised his right hand in greeting it shook with a palsy . " This is the butcher of Grozny . You remember . He is a friend . " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the boys , who could n't have been more than fifteen , asked respectfully . <p> <p> Bin Laden chuckled good-naturedly . " Go now , kittens . Leave us . " <p> <p> The boys left reluctantly . They felt important here . <p> <p> Lysenko approached bin Laden and the two men embraced . <p> <p> " Sit , and we 'll have tea , " bin Laden said . <p> <p> When Lysenko was settled , bin Laden filled small handleless cups of tea from a pot on a small electric brazier . They sat in silence for a long time . A waste , Lysenko thought . All of this  --  the caves , the fighting , the hiding , the jihad  --  yet he never felt more alive , more free , more in command than he did in the middle of an operation . Nine/eleven had been the most sensual day of his life , and he suspected that the next attack would be even more emotional . But it was all for nothing ; they could never win . Bin Laden did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader had been once , briefly , to London , but never to New York or Chicago or Los Angeles . He had no real conception of the vastness of the infidel West . Bringing down the twin trade towers had been a blow to the American psyche , but it had been nothing more than a pinprick against the empire . <p> <p> Yet Lysenko could not give up , not now . Not ever , he suspected , unless the demons that had chased him since he was a child in London finally caught up with him . <p> <p> " The plans are complete ? " bin Laden asked . <p> <p> " Yes . " <p> <p> " All that lacks is the money . And thou wouldst not have taken the risk to come all this way unless you had good news . " <p> <p> " The nuclear demolition device will be delivered across the border from Tajikistan when we have the money . " <p> <p> " Ten million dollars . " <p> <p> " Yes , and we will have the money within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly brightened and he sat forward so quickly he spilled some of his tea . " Tell me . " This last spectacular attack against the U.S. would be much greater than 9/11 , and most likely bin Laden 's last before his failing kidneys finally killed him . <p> <p> " You remember the American couple doing business with the company I set up in Moscow and Vladivostok . The Monroes . " <p> <p> " Yes , but stealing their money with a few business deals will not work . It 's taking too long . " <p> <p> " Mrs. Monroe 's family is wealthy . " <p> <p> Bin Laden moistened his lips . " How wealthy ? " <p> <p> " Rich enough so that the parents would spend ten million to rescue their daughter from her kidnappers . " <p> <p> Bin Laden sat back . " Ah , " he said . " Americans would spend that much to save a daughter ? No Arab would . A son perhaps , but never a daughter . " <p> <p> " January , " Lysenko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting it would be before he allowed her to make the first telephone call . According to Aleksei , who ran the business for them in Moscow , the husband was a blowhard , and the woman was a typical American bitch  --  spoiled and strident . <p> <p> He would teach her respect . And a great many other things that he 'd been taught at Oxford by his Iranian professor of Middle-Eastern studies , who 'd taken him under his wing and into his bed . <p> <p> It was a long way from his roots in Lebanon and his Chechen engineer father and Lebanese mother , who 'd moved to England to avoid persecution . In three months , that winter at Oxford , he had become so radicalized that on a spring break home he and his parents had gotten into a tremendous row over his jihadist conversion , and in a black rage he had slit both of their throats and fled to Saudi Arabia . <p> <p> Excerpted from Burned by David Hagberg Copyright 2009 by David Hagberg Published in June 2009 by Tom Doherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
