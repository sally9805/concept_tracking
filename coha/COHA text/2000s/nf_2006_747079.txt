This study examined the characteristics of an effective Web site in a department of educational leadership at a university in the Southeast . Research on the use of the Web by prospective graduate students has identified consistent findings , yet such studies tend not to delineate among academic programs of study . To determine if variation does exist by academic program , this study utilized qualitative and quantitative methodologies to determine the characteristics that comprise an effective Web site for a specific academic department . Results are consistent with findings in earlier studies , suggesting that academic departments , regardless of discipline , may benefit from the current understanding on the use of the Web by prospective graduate students . <p> The literature on the college choice process indicates that prospective students rely heavily on the information found on institutions ' Web sites ( Poock and Lefond 2001 ; Stoner 2001 ) . Much of the research on Web site influence in the college choice process has focused on prospective undergraduate students ( Christiansen , Davidson , Roper , Sprinkles and Thomas 2003 ; Pope and Fermin 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include the influence of the Web in the college choice process of graduate students ( e.g. , Poock and Lefond 2003 ) . <p> Studies on prospective graduate students ' use of the Web provide an aggregate view of this population . That is , researchers have included graduate students or prospective graduate students from an array of disciplines . It is not known if the views of prospective graduate students vary by field of study . Therefore , this study addresses the characteristics of an effective Web site as viewed by graduate students in a specific field of study , educational leadership . Background <p> The college choice process received enormous attention in the past two decades ( e.g. , Hartman 1997 ; Jackson 1982 ; Konnert and Giese 1987 ; Litten 1982 ) . With the explosion of the Internet came the incorporation of the Web in this process . Researchers have consistently found that prospective students utilize the Web on an increasingly frequent basis . In a 1998 study of Internet use among prospective students , Strauss found that a majority of the participants in their search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Web to some degree . In 2001 , Poock and Lefond studied college bound high school students and found that virtually all of them relied upon the Web when applying to colleges or universities . Clearly , the Web plays an integral role in the college choice process for undergraduates . <p> Research on the college choice process of graduate students has been more recent , and the findings are quite similar to those focusing on undergraduate students . Poock and Lefond ( 2003 ) examined the characteristics of effective graduate school Web sites utilizing focus groups and surveys , and Poock replicated this in 2005 . Additionally , Hoeflich ( 2002 ) surveyed new graduate students at a major research university . A consistent finding in these studies is that an institution 's Web site is the dominant tool utilized by prospective graduate students . <p> Studies have addressed the elements of Web pages that prospective students desire and expect , but researchers have concentrated on individual institutions or a national study within a field of study . It is unclear if differences exist among prospective graduate students when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of effective Web sites as they pertain to prospective graduate students within a given field of study is obviously warranted . For this study , the program of focus is educational leadership . Methodology <p> Participants in the study were graduate students within the department of educational leadership at a doctoral/research university  --  intensive in the state of North Carolina . The methodology for this study used focus groups and surveys . The survey contained several parts . The first section related to when the participants were in the search stage of the college choice process . They rated the importance of specific features on the Web and listed information they expected and desired on a department 's Web site . The second section requested the participants list the information they expected and desired on a department 's Web site as currently enrolled students . The final section solicited demographic information . <p> Three focus groups were also used to collect data . Using a variation of a procedure recommend by Krueger ( 1994 ) , the focus groups were conducted in a computer lab where each participant utilized a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web site , participants were collectively asked to offer their views on the architecture , aesthetics , and overall appearance of the site . Participants were allotted five unstructured minutes to peruse the site , and then asked to share their opinions regarding navigation , graphics , content and architecture . Finally , participants located specific information from the starting point of the department 's homepage . The time it took each participant to find the requested information was recorded . One-third of the participants located courses offered by the department in the current term , one-third located tuition and fees for a full-time , instate student , and one-third located the deadline to apply for the master of school administration program for the upcoming fall semester . Results and Discussion <p> A total of 31 graduate students participated in three focus groups . Twenty-five participants were enrolled in the master of school administration program and six were enrolled in the doctoral program . The majority ( 16 ) were in the first year of their current graduate program and approximately thirty percent ( 9 ) were in their second year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-five percent were female . Approximately seventy-five percent were White , twenty percent African American , with the remainder being either Hispanic or mixed-race . <p> Results from the survey indicate the information on the Web of interest to the participants was not extensive . As Table 1 indicates , the most frequently sought information by participants when they were prospective students include program descriptions and required courses , application information , information on faculty research interests , and opportunities for financial support . The specific courses offered each semester was rarely sought by prospective students . <p> As Table 2 indicates , courses offered each semester was sought by a large number of currently enrolled students . Indeed , this was exceeded only by faculty contact information . There were no other dominant themes present . <p> The information desired by currently enrolled students was expanded with the data provided by the focus groups . Participants were virtually unanimous in stating that dissertation related information was critical ( e.g. , resources for style requirements , sequence of administrative approval of proposal and final defense , etc . ) . Additionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackboard ( the institution 's online instructional tool ) , and e-mail access . That is , currently enrolled students indicated their desire to access all relevant links from the departmental Web site rather than navigate back to the university 's homepage to locate such links . Finally , all the participants who were master 's students desired information on additional degree opportunities ( i.e. , the educational specialist and/or doctoral degree ) . <p> Looking beyond content , the participants preferred a well-organized , somewhat " plain " Web site to one that was , in the words of one participant , " too busy . " Participants indicated the information on a given page should be visually apparent thus making reading easy . Pictures on a Web page were viewed as distracting and provided no substantive purpose . Graphics were viewed as important as they provided a visual cue the user was still at one of the university 's Web pages , but such graphics should not dominate any given page . Finally , the department 's homepage should not require scrolling . Nearly all participants indicated scrolling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As one participant commented , " lots of homepages do n't require scrolling . Homepages that do require scrolling down either have too much information or are not well organized . The burden is really on the designers of the pages to provide information to us ; the burden should n't be on us to locate the information . " <p> As for how the information is organized , the focus group participants appreciated addressing both target populations and functional topics . That is , headings such as " for current students " and " for prospective students " made it helpful for users of the site to locate information . Additionally , users who were looking for specific information also valued utilizing functional topics ( admission , financial assistance , etc . ) Obviously lacking in the opinion of the participants was a link entitled " for new students . " Many of the participants voiced the view that once they applied to a program and were accepted , they did not know where to look for information . They were no longer prospective students and were not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population would be quite helpful in organizing information . <p> An appropriate test of how the information is organized is the time it takes to locate information . Toward this end , the focus group participants were given specific information to find and the time it took to locate the information was recorded . Participants who were asked to locate department courses offered in the current term did so in an average of two minutes and seven seconds . The total number of clicks to locate this information ranged from 7 to 20 . Participants who were asked to locate the cost of tuition and fees for a full-time , in-state student averaged forty-four seconds with an average of two clicks . The final group of participants was asked to locate the deadline for fall 2005 admission to the department 's master 's program . Those who located the information did so in an average of one minute and twenty seconds . However , half of the participants assigned this task could not locate the information within three minutes , at which point the exercise was stopped . Implications <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students are information on admissions , financial assistance , and the research interests of faculty . Faculty research is also important to current students . It is important to note that this population desires a department Web site that supplants all others . That is , one-stop shopping for information is preferred over department 's information on the department 's site , library and other information on the institutions homepage , etc . Since the students have an interest in the specific information available on a department 's site , adding links to accommodate their needs appears to be an effective use of resources and the students ' time . <p> The organization of a departmental Web site should be clear , clean , and devoid of distracting images and other non-essential items . Current and prospective students are seeking easy-to-find information and anything else is simply annoying . The information on the homepage should be contained within one page that does not require scrolling , and the clustering of information by both target population and functional topic is effective . Incorporating information for newly admitted students within the target population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that is valued by individuals who have been admitted but not yet enrolled . Conclusion <p> The importance of the Web in the undergraduate college choice process is well documented and received considerable attention from researchers . In recent years such attention has extended graduate students , yet little is known about the Web needs of prospective and current students of specific academic programs . <p> This study evaluated the effective characteristics of a Web site for a department of educational leadership that offers graduate programs only . The findings were consistent with previous studies that did not differentiate by academic program , and suggests that discipline is not a mitigating factor when determining effective characteristics of Web sites .
