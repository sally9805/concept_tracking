<p> Betty McKemie opens her scrapbook and smiles as her eyes fall on the landing card that admitted her to America . <p> " I never saw the Statue of Liberty that day , " she says in a gentle accent that 's a bit Southern and quite a bit British  --  sort of an English drawl . <p> That day was 60 years ago . As McKemie 's ship steamed into New York harbor , hundreds of British war brides lined the rails to behold the symbol of their new home . But she was n't among them . <p> McKemie had been paged with word that her husband of six months would be waiting at the pier . So instead of sightseeing , she went below to pack . When the ship docked , she put him to work toting a heavy case that held her collection of 78 rpm records . <p> " I was n't sure they would have a classical music station where I was going , " she explains . " They did n't . " <p> McKemie was going to southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U.S. Army doctor . She was part of a remarkable migration of British women who had married American servicemen stationed overseas during World War II . For eight months in 1946 , a flotilla of ships that had recently ferried troops to Europe transported 48,000 of their spouses , children and fiancees back across the Atlantic . <p> " I felt rather like a mail-order bride , " McKemie says , sitting in the parlor of her home in Avondale Estates , the English-themed village where she and her husband , Frank , moved after 3 1/2 decades in Albany . <p> Now 80 , she 's a slender woman with fine features and a polite manner that seems at once properly British and Southern . As she leafs through the scrapbook , her husband , a tall , lanky man in his late 80s , enters with the help of a cane and takes a seat . He 's hard of hearing and ca n't follow what his wife is saying over the classical music drifting in from a kitchen radio . <p> She looks at him sweetly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things I gave up to come live with you . " <p> A relationship blooms <p> The McKemies met a few months before D-Day when Frank wandered into the small-town library where Betty 's mother was working . <p> Betty Bonser was from London . When war broke out and the Luftwaffe began attacking the city , an unexploded bomb fell in her family 's front yard . They fled the destruction and moved upriver to Shiplake-on-Thames , her barrister father commuting to work in the city . Then a V-1 buzz bomb flattened his law office . <p> One day in early 1944 , Capt . Frank McKemie , one of 3 million U.S. service members who passed through Britain during the war , stopped by the library and struck up a conversation with Betty 's mother . She invited him and two other soldiers home for Sunday lunch . Frank returned the following Sunday , not so much for the roast duck as for the Bonsers ' 17-year-old daughter . <p> " She was pretty , " he says , " and she had such a sunny disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long walks along the Thames , talking about music and books . Frank told her about his home in Coleman , Ga. , in the deep country south of Columbus . <p> Betty knew a little about the South . She had seen " Gone With the Wind " at Leicester Square in London , but she realized there was more to the story . She also had read Lillian Smith 's controversial book about lynching , " Strange Fruit . " <p> " My father had some reservations about me coming to Georgia , " she says . " He said there was going to be a lot of trouble there . " <p> Father was right . His daughter was living in Albany when the trouble came years later during the civil rights protests of the early ' 60s . At one point , some people there wanted to close the library rather than desegregate it . McKemie circulated a petition to keep it open . <p> " A city without a library , " she says , " would have been unthinkable .

Not until the war ended was he able to return to England and marry Betty in her parish church . Soon he was discharged and went back to Georgia to await his wife . <p> In the fall of 1945 , tens of thousands of British war brides were anxious to rejoin their husbands , but there was little transportation available for them . Few planes flew across the Atlantic in those days , and most ships were being used to carry millions of servicemen home . In their frustration , hundreds of brides staged protests in front of the U.S. Embassy in London . <p> The U.S. Army finally organized a ferry system of 20 former troopships , with assistance from the Red Cross . Brides would gather at a military camp in southern England , and then it was on to the New World . Other ships took brides from elsewhere in Europe . <p> " It was a brave undertaking . Many of them left thinking they would never see their homes or families again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , who wrote a book about the migration , " Good-bye , Piccadilly . " <p> The first ship arrived in New York in February 1946 to a cheering crowd , newsreel cameras and cute banner headlines like " Wives Aweigh " and " Here Come the Brides . " <p> Beyond the hoopla , problems developed . The ships were overcrowded and ill-equipped to deal with infant medical complications . On one voyage that spring , nine babies died during an outbreak of diarrhea . In response , U.S. authorities decreed that no infants under 6 months and no mothers more than 6 months pregnant could board . <p> No such tragedies marred Betty McKemie 's passage . <p> She left England in March with 1,388 women and children aboard the John Ericsson , a luxury liner that had been stripped and pressed into service as a troop carrier . It was jammed like all the ships , but it offered one amenity that impressed women who had lived through six years of wartime rationing : an abundance and variety of food . <p> " I had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not that all the brides could enjoy the fare . Many of them were seasick . <p> McKemie turns her scrapbook to the pages about the voyage , where she preserved copies of the ship 's newspaper , the Seaweed Gazette . There 's a poem in one issue : <p> The seas are rough , the liner rides <p> At most uneven keel . <p> And half the little G.I. brides <p> Ca n't eat a single meal . <p> " I had a lower berth , " she recalls . " I would n't have taken it if I had known that the girl in the upper bunk was going to be sick all the time . " <p> Red Cross representatives staffed the ship and kept the ladies busy with dance lessons and classes on U.S. currency and American English . ( Remember : What we call roll-ons the Yanks call girdles . ) The Seaweed Gazette chipped in with a primer on clothes sizes and thumbnail introductions to the states ( New Jersey , it claimed , was the Mosquito State ) . <p> One newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inquiring Reporter asked brides whether their husbands would love them as much as they did when they were married . <p> " I 'll kick him in the teeth if he does n't , " answered a Mrs. Cater , one of 11 wives bound for Georgia . <p> For most of the voyage , McKemie says , she was too excited about starting her new life to feel homesick . Her mood changed on the day before they landed . At a farewell dinner and chapel service , the brides promised to keep in touch and wept as they sang the hymn " God Be With You Till We Meet Again . " <p> " I never doubted my decision , " she says . " But for the first time , I realized how far from home I would always be . " <p> Adapting to the South <p> After their reunion in New York , the McKemies took a train to Atlanta , which was ablaze with springtime azaleas and dogwoods . Like most of the brides , Betty had only woolens to wear , so her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lighter-weight clothes . <p> " It was hotter than a cracker box that first summer , " she says , recalling how she would take showers and lie on the bed under a lazy ceiling fan trying not to sweat . Air conditioning was uncommon then . She soon broke out in a heat rash . <p> From Atlanta , the couple drove to southwest Georgia to meet Frank 's family , who farmed and raised cattle . They hit it off famously . His sister even offered to take Betty fishing and warned her to watch for chigger bites . <p> Chiggers ? she asked . <p> While they were on the pond , Betty saw a snake swimming through the water . " I do n't think I 'd ever seen a snake before , " she says . " I decided I did n't want to go fishing again . " <p> McKemie was a minor celebrity at first , the subject of newspaper write-ups and Rotary invitations . As the novelty wore off , she eventually settled in to her new life as a doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She became a naturalized citizen and was awarded a citizenship medal from the Daughters of the American Revolution . She raised five children . <p> For a time , McKemie stayed in touch with a few of the other brides in Georgia . Some were unhappy , complaining about the climate , the native diet and how they could never find the things they missed from England . <p> McKemie would have none of it . " I wanted to assimilate , " she says . " You have to bloom where you 're planted . " <p> It helped that much of her family followed her to the States . <p> After her father died in the late ' 40s , her mother moved to Georgia to be near her only daughter . One brother attended Emory University and stayed in Atlanta . Another moved to Albany , working hard to erase his British accent so he could sell insurance to Georgians . <p> McKemie did n't go that far in adapting . In fact , she clings to one custom from the old country every day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost 4 o'clock . <p> " Would you like a spot of tea ? " she asks . <p> She excuses herself and returns in a few minutes with a tray of teacups and a platter of cookies and finger sandwiches . She offers them to her husband , who has never regretted walking into that library six decades ago . <p> TALES OF MORE WAR BRIDES <p> How did Brits feel about their women leaving with Yanks ? <p> * Mollie Parry King got a clue when she left Wales in 1946 to join her husband , William D. King , in Colbert , Ga . As her ship left port , it passed a returning troopship . " What 's your cargo ? " the troopship signaled . War brides , came the answer . Then a British accent cried across the water : " Why ... did n't ... you ... wait ? " <p> In the States , war brides were almost universally welcomed , says historian Jenel Virden , who studied the women for her book " Good-bye , Piccadilly . " But she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish-American family and was shocked to discover that her in-laws and most of her neighbors spoke no English . <p> * A group of newly arrived brides was waiting at a train station when they noticed a sign for " colored toilets . " They were about to charge into the restroom to see this amazing American innovation  --  toilets of different colors !  --  when a local woman pulled them aside to explain . <p> * Virden 's own war bride mother disliked her new home in Iowa . When her husband 's family passed her a bowl of corn , she scoffed , " It 's maize . My mother feeds that to the chickens . " <p> Despite the cultural bumps , most of the marriages stuck . Of the 100 or so brides Virden surveyed , only 8 percent divorced . <p>  --  Jim Auchmutey Photo : Family photoMollie Parry married U.S. soldier William D. King ( shown in 1946 ) in Wales in 1944 .
