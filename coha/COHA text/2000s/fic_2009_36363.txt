" Mango Meltdown or Berry Blast ? " <p> Ty Hauck scanned the shelves of the Exxon station 's refrigerated cooler . <p> " Whatever . . . " his thirteen-year-old daughter , Jessie , responded with a shrug , her eyes alighting on something more appealing . " What about this ? " <p> Powie Zowie . <p> Hauck reached inside and read the brightly colored label . Megajolt of caffeine . Highest bang for the buck . <p> " Your mother lets you drink this stuff ? " he asked skeptically . <p> Jessie looked back at him . " Mom 's not exactly here , is she ? " <p> " No . " Hauck nodded , meeting her gaze . " I guess she 's not . " <p> In just the past year , forbidding new curves had sprung up on his daughter 's once-childlike body . Bra straps peeking out from under her tank top . Jeans clinging to the hips in an " unnatural " way . Gangly suddenly morphing into something a bit more in the range of troubling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrugs , and exaggerated sighs . Hauck wondered if the request for an ankle tattoo or a belly piercing could be far behind . " You do n't get to win , " a friend who had teenage daughters once warned him . " You only delay . " <p> Jesus , he recalled , it was just a year ago that she liked to get shoulder rides from me . <p> " Toss it in the basket , " he said , acquiescing . " One . " <p> Jessie shrugged without even the slightest smile , failing to grasp the significance of his offering . " Okay . " <p> At the end of the aisle , a man in a green down vest and tortoiseshell glasses reached into the cooler and met Hauck 's gaze . His amused , empathetic smile seemed to say , Know exactly what you 're going through , man ! <p> Hauck grinned back . <p> A year had passed since the Grand Central bombing . A year since the events set in motion by the hit-and-run accident down on Putnam Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public eye . In that year , Hauck had been on the morning news shows and MSNBC and Greta Van Susteren , the case rocking not just the tall iron gates of the Loire-styled mansions out on North Avenue , but the financial circles in New York as well . It had turned Hauck into a bit of a reluctant celebrity  --  the object of friendly ribbing from his staff and the local merchants along the avenue . Even his old hockey buddies , who used to tip their mugs to him because of how he once tore up the football league at Greenwich High , now joked about whether he knew Paris or Nicole , or could get them past the bouncers into some fancy new club in the city on a Saturday night . Finally Hauck just had to step back , get his life in order . <p> And keep things on a steady keel with Karen , whose husband 's death had been at the heart of the case . <p> And with whom he had fallen in love . <p> At first , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was rich . Hauck was the head of detectives on the local force . Their families , lifestyles , did n't exactly merge . Not to mention all the attention the case had generated . That in solving the mystery of her husband 's death Hauck had unleashed something buried and now restless inside her . In the past year , her father , Mel , had taken ill with Parkinson 's . Her mother was n't handling it well . Karen had gone down to Atlanta to help take care of him , with her daughter away at Tufts and her son , Alex , now sixteen , recruited to play lacrosse at an upstate prep school . <p> It had been a year in which Hauck had finally learned to put much of the pain of his own past behind him . To learn to feel attached again . To fight for someone he wanted . He knew Karen loved him deeply for what he had done for her . Still , a lot of things stood in the way . Not just the money thing or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in her . A restlessness . Maybe a sense of wanting to finally be free after being tied to a man her whole adult life , one who had so painfully deceived her . It was always a roll of the dice , they both knew , how things might work out between them . The jury was still out . <p> " C'm on , " he said to Jess , " grab some M&amp;M 's ; the boat 's waiting . " <p> The autumn chill was late in coming that October Saturday morning , and they were heading out for a final jaunt on his skiff , the Merrily , over to Captain 's Island before taking it out of the water for the winter . Maybe kick the soccer ball around a bit  --  not a mean feat these days for Hauck ( whose leg had still not fully healed from the .45 he had taken to the thigh ) . Grill a few dogs . Who knew how many more of these Saturdays he 'd have with Jess . Just getting her up before ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped off on the way to fill up the Explorer and pick up a few snacks . <p> Sunil , who ran the Exxon station next to the car wash on Putnam , was always a friend to the guys on the force . Hauck always made it his habit to fill up here . <p> As they reached the counter , a woman was at the register ahead of them . The man in the green down vest stepped up , his arms wrapped around two six-packs of soda . <p> " You guys go ahead . " He waved them ahead and smiled good-naturedly . <p> " Thanks . " Hauck nodded back and nudged Jessie . <p> " Thanks , " she turned back and said . <p> While they waited , Hauck said , " You know , I really hope you 'll come up for Thanksgiving this year . Karen 'll be back . " <p> She shrugged . " I do n't know , Dad . " <p> " You should . She likes you , Jess . You know that . It would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . . . " She twisted her mouth .
