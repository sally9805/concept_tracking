" A renowned connoisseur of fine cuisine , Wilde would have made a reliable as well as humorous guide to the contemporary grocery-shopping experience , with its barrage of competing messages , information labels and health claims . Trusting in appearances is one of the best methods for you to test which of the many foods you have to choose from are the healthiest and most healing .

Avocados are a rich source of the essential fatty acid ( EFA ) omega-9 , necessary for optimal nutrition . Omega-9 also helps promote hormone regulation , the transportation of fat through the body and the breakup of cholesterol . Because avocados are higher in calories than other fruits-two  --  thirds of an avocado has about 150 calories-you might not want to serve the so-called " alligator pear " at every meal . Instead , add a slice to your favorite sandwich or enjoy some guacamole at your next fiesta . The two varieties-Florida and California-have slightly different nutritional value . The Florida variety is lower in calories and fat , but both are rich in vitamin C and riboflavin .

Unfortunately , modern science has been able to do little to alleviate this unpleasantness , so many garlic lovers seek alternatives . Add chopped garlic to recipes at the end of cooking , to preserve health benefits while slightly reducing the potency-and pungency-of this herb . Kale Cultivated for 2,000 years , kale is a great source of the trio of potent cancer-fighting antioxidants-vitamins C and E and beta carotene .
