The blood-typing error that resulted in 17-year-old Jesica Santillan 's being given the wrong heart and lungs was , by all accounts , an unusual mistake for the prestigious Duke University Hospital . Even rarer in some ways was the frank public acknowledgment of error by the hospital , followed by a sincere apology from her doctor . According to a study published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association , that sort of thing does n't happen often enough , especially for patients who desperately want more information about what 's happening to them  --  both good and bad . <P> While we can be pretty sure that medical errors occur with some frequency  --  nearly 100,000 deaths a year are caused by such errors , one survey reported  --  it is less clear that doctors or hospitals will voluntarily own up to their mistakes . In a study published in 1991 , 76% of the doctors surveyed said they had not fully disclosed a serious error to one of their patients . And a separate survey conducted last year found that only 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem by the health-care professional responsible for the mistake . <P> Why the disconnect ? In part , it has to do with familiar pressures : fear of malpractice suits ; potential damage to a hard-earned reputation ; the awkwardness of admitting you were wrong . Indeed , doctors will tell you they are emotionally devastated by their mistakes and wish they could be more open with their patients . <P> But the communication breakdown may also have something to do with how patients and doctors define medical errors . After studying 52 patients and 46 physicians , Dr. Thomas Gallagher , an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle and the lead author of last week 's J.A.M.A . paper , concluded that patients define errors much more broadly than their doctors , including not just adverse medical outcomes but also substandard service and deficient interpersonal skills . Physicians , on the other hand , define errors quite narrowly , counting only clear deviations from accepted standards of care . <P> In the new survey , patients said they wanted to know about any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would make exceptions when the harm is trivial or they think a patient might not understand the error or want to know about it . As far as apologies go , both patients and physicians agreed they were a good idea in principle . Doctors , however , were worried that saying " I 'm sorry " could imply legal liability . <P> Despite all these concerns , attitudes toward medical errors are starting to change . Gallagher says there has been " a gradual loosening " among hospital administrators in charge of managing risk about the disclosure of medical errors . Rather than instructing physicians to be " spin doctors " and keep a cautious tongue , more and more hospitals are letting them be what they are : medical doctors who are human and sometimes make mistakes .
