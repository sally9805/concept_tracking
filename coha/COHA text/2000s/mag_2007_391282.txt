Headnote James Blunt went from guarding the queen of England to reigning as a global pop idol . He 's loved and he 's hated , but it does n't matter at his villa in Ibiza , where an unstoppable twenty-four-hour party rages IT S 4 A.M. ON A MONDAY , AND A WARM Mediterranean wind is blowing through L'Elphant , the open-air bar that sits on one of the rolling hills of Ibiza , the Spanish isle that is a world-renowned bacchanalian paradise , where Ecstasy-fueled parties rage on well past sunrise . Leggy Euromodels prance around the octagonal deck , and on the horizon , beyond miles of darkness , one can see the bright lights beaming onto the sixteenth-century fortress of Ibiza 's Old Town . James Blunt is here , wired and ready , with a dozen friends who are all ensconced on white couches , chatting and sipping vodka and beer . L'Elephant is merely a pit stop on this evening 's bizarre , drugged-up journey , which began hours ago with drinks at a seaside bar in town and then wound its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our next destination is Amnesia , an allnight disco that throbs to house music . We 'd be on our way there already , but we 're stuck in a holding pattern . As Lou Reed might say , we 're waiting for the man . So far , the man is two hours late . Blunt , who has vacationed in Ibiza since he was fourteen years old , now lives here full time . Last year , he bought a fully furnished villa in a secluded valley with the dough he made off his debut album , Back to Bedlam - which moved more than n million copies worldwide thanks to the smash single " You 're Beautiful . " That ubiquitous song - a true story about spying a longlost love with her new boyfriend on a London subway , and the flood of emotions shared in that single glance - is , depending on your perspective , either deeply touching or unfathomably awful , and has made Blunt one of the most polarizing figures in music today . But he does n't take the haters personally : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But they had a lot of chocolate cake . And eventually they started saying , Tm bored of chocolate cake . ' It does n't have to do with who made the cake . You just say , " Today I 'm going to have lemon meringue . ' It 's like going into the kitchen and screaming at the chef . It just seems childish . " Still , you ca n't help noticing that as Blunt became famous and people got fed up with his chocolate cake , he decamped to Ibiza . The beach and the night life are just a short drive from his house , and the seasonal cycle of the island seems to suit his dual temperaments : The lonely winters , when clubs are closed and the island turns into a ghost land , offer him the solitude he needs to " become human again " and indulge in his most personal songwriting . And the wild summers afford Blunt his other favorite pastime : partying like a depraved animal . On his new album , All the Lost Souls , fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs was written in , but here 's a cheat sheet : " I 'll Take Everything , " " One of the Brightest Stars " and " Shine On " are " winter songs , " says Blunt . Summer yielded more uptempo cuts like " Give Me Some Love " and " 1973 , " which was triggered at 9 A.M. while Blunt was still shitfaced outside the legendary club Pacha . On this particular Monday night , however , the place to be is not Pacha but Amnesia 's Cocoon party . Stocked up and ready to roll , a few of us pile into Blunt 's gray ' ' 91 Volkswagen Golf ( it came with the house ) and bomb down the road toward the massive club . Soon we are escorted up a back staircase and led to an exclusive perch above the dance floor . To our left , German DJ Sven Vth operates from a booth more than fifty feet wide , in front of a mile-high backdrop of speakers . Below us , a sea of thousands of tripped-out vacationers writhes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse with images similar to those on Liquid Television , and it all gets better as the drugs kick in . Hours fly by , and Blunt 's unique combination of intensity and quiet remove are even more apparent . Blunty ( as he 's known to his friends ) putters around , dancing in a subdued manner and , being a pro in this manner of debauchery , is constantly mindful and considerate of his friends ' highs : Just when you need it , he seems to boogie out of the darkness armed with water or a cigarette to take the edge off . " Is n't this fucking brilliant ? ! " he keeps suggesting to me , and when the MDMA is n't hijacking my brain , I ca n't help but agree . The fascinating conversation goes on until Amnesia closes at nine in the morning , and the bleary-eyed greet the blazing sun . Last summer , it was at this point in the day that Blunt would tear himself away from the party to write . " To go home in the morning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh , really fun , " he says with a grin , precisely aware of how demented his system sounds . But not this morning . We pile back into Blunt 's VW and cruise over to a private villa , where DJ Sven has taken over a poolside cabana and the party lingers on . By the time we get back to Blunt 's secluded estate , it 's about 2 P.M. , roughly seventeen hours since the adventure began . A MONTH LATER , BACK IN New York , Blunt hops out of a taxi and into a helicopter . He is in bad shape . He did n't sleep the night before , raging until dawn at a hot spot called Tenjune . Chartered by his label boss , Warner Music Group mogul Lyor Cohen , our chopper lifts off and circles over Central Park , past Shea Stadium and out to Long Island , landing at the East Hampton airport . An SUV greets us and takes us to a $3,000-aticket James Taylor concert being staged for Hamptons high rollers . Blunt has a low music IQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire and Rain , " he still has no idea who Taylor is , but he 's impressed by the singer 's six-foot-plus frame . " I thought all songwriters had to be short , " says Blunt , who is five feet eight . After the show , we head to a club called Pink Elephant , where we party until 5 A.M. among scenesters like Mischa Barton ( who happens to star in Blunt 's video for " Goodbye My Lover " ) and the Olsen twins . The next week , the tabloids go wild . A New York Daily ? iews gossip item reads like this : In the Hamptons , Blunt hits on Barton ; becomes bored ; hits on the Olsen twins ; Barton exacts revenge by ditching him at Pink Elephant . Of course , none of this is true . Not that Blunt cares that much . He considers himself a victim of the tabloids - which constantly reported tales of infidelity during his yearlong relationship with supermodel Petra Nemcova . " I recognized the names , " he says . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangover on a Bridgehampton beach the next morning , I ask Blunt for his life story . The tale that unfolds over the next four hours will surprise those who know the singer only as the " You 're Beautiful " balladeer . In 1974 , baby James was born in an army hospital in the town of Tidworth , an hour and a half west of London , the eldest child of Jane and Charles Blount ( James modified the name ) . His father was an army helicopter pilot who instilled in his son a love for aviation , and because his dad was redeployed every two years , Blunt 's earliest memories come from all over the world . As a boy he lived in Cyprus and spent time in the countryside of Northern England before moving to a lake house in Germany . " It affected the way I see the world and my relationships , " he says about being constantly uprooted . " Every two years , I just moved on . " At seven , Blunt was accepted at the exclusive prep school Elstree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in posh boarding academies that fuels the rumor about Blunt 's life having been one of privilege . Blunt insists that he 's not a trust-fund baby . " My band members are paid more than my dad ever made , " he says . " The army assisted with my school fees , so I was at a privileged school , but we kind of bluffed our way into it . " Blunt 's musical journey began at age five , when his mother made him learn the violin . In school , he enjoyed tennis and rugby , and continued his musical lessons . At fourteen , he spied another student with an electric guitar and wanted one of his own . It came in the shape of a Fender Telecaster . Soon he began writing his first songs . " Teenage angst , " he says . " The " I 'm so misunderstood " thing . I had lots to say . " He was intent on making a life out of music but agreed with his parents that he should back up that dream with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied aerospace engineering . He already had a pilot 's license , earned at age sixteen from the Royal Air Force , and was excited about the idea of building a plane . But after twelve years at female-free boarding schools , he was also ready to cut loose . " Bars , pubs , clubs , bottles full of bub , " he says . " I spent most of my time asleep on the floor of the lectures . " ( He was a C student . ) Around this time Blunt had a major relationship - " a few years " - with the girl who would inspire " You 're Beautiful . " For reasons of privacy , Blunt wo n't reveal her identity . " The song explains as much as I would want to , " he says . Otherwise , I 'd be singing her name . It obviously affected me . It 's a bit heavy . " YOU 'RE FUCKING WEIRD . " Blunt heard that phrase more than once during his one-year stay at the Royal Military Academy , the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bristol , Blunt owed the military four years and gave them six . ) While enduring the grueling physical demands and the degradation that go hand in hand with life in the army , Blunt developed a smart-ass rebelliousness , as well as the slight disengagement you see in his eyes . " It 's being able to deal with other shit , and that creates different ways of thinking , " he says . " Do you follow the line , or do you find other ways to enjoy this fuckin ' weird culture , how to enjoy the madness ? Do you go , " Yes , sir , no , sir ' ' ? Or do you say , " You 're so manly ! ' ' ? It was a miserable experience . Like hell . Living in the rain , not sleeping for a week and hallucinating . The drugs were free - those were the bonuses . " The rest of his army career was a wild ride . As a reconnaissance officer , he went to Canada , where he learned Russian war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn until dusk and drank all night . In 1999 , as a peacekeeper in the war in Kosovo , Blunt was in a tank on the front lines - it was the one with the acoustic guitar strapped on the back . " You wonder , " How will you respond to that kind of destruction and death and inhumane violence ? ' " he says . " You just have to detach yourself . " He still enjoys pushing the limits of endurance ( he hardly sleeps ) and testing his psychological threshold ( he enjoys his drugs ) . And his quest for a thrill has nearly killed him . On a surfing trip to Mexico 's Puerto Escondido , Blunt paddled out into a monstrous break . After eating it on a wave , he was dragged out of the ocean unconscious . " After inhaling water and seeing black , I had an elated feeling , " he says . " It was kind of fun . " After Kosovo , Blunt returned to London and accepted a ceremonial post as one of Queen Elizabeth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch his music career . ( The queen is down-to-earth and incredibly savvy , according to Blunt . ) " I had songs , " he says . " But I had no idea how one gets a record deal . " Blunt , as ever , was tenacious . On London 's singer-songwriter circuit , he met Jimmy Hogarth and Sacha Skarbek , two friends who would share writing credits for a handful of songs on Bac to Bedlam . After two years of " crappy little bars , " Blunt hooked up with Todd Interland , who worked for Elton John , and in 2003 relocated to Los Angeles to cut Bacto Bedlam . " I had no idea if anyone would hear it , " he says . " They 're just genuine songs , and people connect with that . In my everyday life , I 'm not terribly open . I just put it in the songs . " When radio got its hands on " You 're Beautiful , " all hell broke loose . In the summer of 2005 , while in Switzerland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're Beautiful " and Bac to Bedlam had hit the top of the charts . " It 's really fucking odd to get a phone call saying that your life has changed , " he says . " I just paced around my hotel room saying , " Fuck , fuck , fuck , it was n't supposed to do this . ' " TOWARD THE END OF " UEDlam " " s rise , Blunt chose Ibiza for its unique combination of serenity and madness , and though he does n't speak Spanish , he has learned one important phrase - " Please wear a condom " - most likely through hearing it repeated so often . ( I overhear him tell someone that , yes , in fact , he is a sex addict , and he hates to go home alone . ) He lives in the ultimate bachelor pad . On one side ofhis swimming pool is a partitioned cabana with a fifteen-foot day bed and a custom Badato Bedhm foosball table . Over the stereo there 's a neon sign that reads blunty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakes up every day and goes , " This is it . This is my chance to do these things I 've always wanted to do , ' " says Blunt 's friend and co-writer , Hogarth . " I think James is measured enough to look ahead , because of the discipline he got in the army . He 's probably looking ahead five or six years and going , " I 'll stop all this then . I 'm just going to do it really hard right now . ' " On the piano in his living room , there 's a photo of Blunt hitting it hard , a sepia ' tone shot of him as a teenager , wearing knee-high faux-leopard-skin boots , a tank top accentuated with a feathery boa , and Bono-esque sunglasses . Atop the piano are a few other pictures : one of Blunt in the army , next to a photo of him with Nemcova . Above the fireplace is a black-and-white photo of a young blonde wearing a tight white sweater with a heart-shaped pendant around her neck . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ex , " but I eventually find out that it 's the " You 're Beautiful " girl . She is stunning , a cross between Leelee Sobieski and Evan Rachel Wood . I ca n't help but think that if he had never seen her face ( in a crowded place ) then neither of us would be here right now . It 's from the vantage point ofhis piano bench that Blunt wrote every song on All the Lost Souls . " They 're about the past few years , " he says . " I ca n't escape the fact that people are watching what I do . If I 'm in a pub and go to the loo , people are wondering what I 'm doing in there . " Uh , he 's been in there awhile . He 's definitely not taking a piss . ' Every situation for the last three and a half years has been manic . But as a writer , that 's great .

" All the Lost Souls , the title , came to Blunt in Los Angeles , when he reteamed with producer Tom Rothrock and began the recording process . " As opposed to animals , we can think about why we 're here on planet Earth and look for greater depth and meaning , " he says . " But we look in all the wrong places , like defining success by money and fame . " He also sees an advantage to being such a divisive presence in music . " I have the great fortune of having this incredibly positive and negative reaction toward the first album , " Blunt says . " Whatever I put out , people are going to have a go at it . So I might as well just come back to the core reason for writing songs , which is because I need to do it and I love to do it . I do n't do it for the stranger who 's going to say this or that .
