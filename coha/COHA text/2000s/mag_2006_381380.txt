Post-Monica , the female intern in the nation 's capital has a reputation that 's part Catholic schoolgirl , part Paris Hilton : sexy , scantily clad and technically off-limits , but too clueless to know better . Such stereotyping is n't fair to most of the ambitious young women who flock to Washington each year ( 20,000 interns arrive every summer , counting the boys ) .
