1 IN THE SPRING PAULUS SET out north from The Fells , hunting the apprentice Myros . He can not be allowed to collect his six , the wizard had said . If you can not find his track , you must kill whichever of the six he has already selected . It did Paulus " conscience no good to kill people whose only fault was being collected by an aspiring wizard , but he would be only the first of many hunters . Without the guild 's protection , a wizard 's six were like baby turtles struggling toward the sea . Best to spare them a life of being hunted . The apprentice had spent enough time in the Agate Tower to know that there would be pursuit . He was moving fast and had four months " head start , - Paulus moved faster , riding through nights and spring storms , fording spring-swollen rivers , asking quiet questions over bottles in public houses along the only road over the mountains . He killed the first of the apprentice 's collection on a farm between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a small boy with a dirty face and a stick in his hand . Yes , mister , a man passed by here in the winter . Yes , mister , he had a ring over his glove . I was feeding the pig , and he told me I was a likely boy . Are you looking for him ? Can I see your sword ? They were n't supposed to choose children , Paulus was thinking as he rode on . Even apart from the cultural sanction , children 's magic was powerful but unpredictable , tricky to harness . No wonder the guild was after this one . In a public house that evening , the day 's chill slowly ebbing from his feet , Paulus said a prayer for the boy 's parents . He hoped they had n't sent anyone after him . It was bad enough to kill children/ he had even less desire to take the lives of vengeful bumpkins . Best to keep moving . Already he had gained a month on the apprentice , who was moving fast for a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had once been one of the king 's rangers . Upstairs in his room , Paulus watched a thin drift of snow appear on the windowsill , spilling onto the plank floor . His prayer beads worked through his fingers . Go , boy , he thought . Speed your way to heaven . He dreamed of turtles , and of great birds that flew at night . In the morning the snow had stopped , and Paulus cut a piece of cheese from a wheel left out in the kitchen . He stuck the knife in the remaining cheese and set a coin next to it , then left through the back door and saddled his horse without waking the stable boy . He rode hard , into the mountains and over the first of the passes where the road lay under drifted snow taller than a man on horseback . The horse picked out the track ; like Paulus , it had been this way before . It was blowing hard by noon , when they had come to the bottom of a broad valley dotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates of the manor and waited to be noticed . The gate creaked open , revealing a choleric elder in threadbare velvet , huddled under a bearskin cloak . " Who comes to the house of Baron Branchefort ? " Paulus dismounted and let the seneschal see the sigil of the Agate Tower dangling from the horse 's bridle . " I ride on an errand from the wizards " guild in The Fells , " he said . " Has an apprentice traveled through this valley ? " " And how would I know an apprentice ? " " He would wear a ring over the glove on his right hand . He is called Myros . " The elder nodded . " Aye , he was here . Visited the Baron asking permission to gather plant lore . " " Was this granted ? " " It was . He was our guest for a week and a day , then rode to the head of the valley . " " Did he gather any herbs ? " " I did not observe . " " You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . He travels to collect children . " The elder held Paulus " gaze for a long moment . " This is why you follow him . " " It is . Are there children in your house ? " " No . The Baron nears his eightieth year . We have few servants , and no children . " Paulus offered up a prayer of thanks that he would not have to enter the manor . He had seen more than enough of noble houses fallen into somnolence . Standing at the gate of this one , his chest constricted and he thought of his brother . " Where , " he asked , " are the houses in this valley with children ? " The elder looked up at the sky , then down at the ground between his feet . " Many children come into this world , " he said . " Few survive . Only one of the Baron 's vassals has children below marriageable age . He is called Philo , and his house is the last before the road rises into the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You will ease Philo 's mind , I pray , " the elder said . " What ease I can give , I will give , " Paulus said , and rode north . Philo 's house lay in the shadow of a double peak , across the saddle of which lay Paulus " route over the mountains . As Paulus rode up , the sun rested between the peaks . A man about Paulus " age , but with the caved-in chest and stooped neck of too much work and not enough food , was drawing water . A girl of seven or eight years stood waiting with an empty bucket . " Philo , " Paulus said . " That is my name , " Philo said , without looking up at Paulus , as he hauled a full bucket over the edge of the well . He emptied it into the bucket his daughter set on the ground at his feet . " And this is my daughter Sophia . Now you know what of us is worth knowing . " " A young man wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulus said . Philo dropped the bucket back into the well . " He has . " " He spoke to your daughter . " " That 's right , sir , he did . Told her she was a likely girl . She 's always seemed so to me , but if I was any judge of men or girls I would n't be here . " Still Philo had not met Paulus " gaze . Paulus began to wonder what had passed between him and Myros ; or was his demeanor caused by the Brancheforts ? No matter . " I come from The Fells , " Paulus said . " My instructions are to gather the girl he spoke to . For service at the Agate Tower . " At this , Philo looked up and Paulus and put a hand around his daughter 's thin shoulders . Now it was Paulus who wanted to look away . He forced himself to hold Philo 's eye . " She 's my only , sir , " Philo said . " And my wife , we 're too old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I have no quarrel with you . My errand is my errand . " He watched the awful calculus of the peasant on Philo 's face . One fewer mouth to feed . Giving his daughter over to a life of service with the wizards of The Fells , where she would spend the rest of her days forgetting what it was like to go to bed hungry . And against that .... " May we visit her , sir ? " " When she has been gone a year , " Paulus said . He was a poor liar , but this provision he remembered from his own journey to The Fells as a boy , when he had been taken into the King 's Acrobats . His mother had never come . After a year he had stopped expecting her . " Before that , " he said , " she will still long for home . You may write as long as you do not ask her to return . Censors at the guild will destroy your letters if you do . " Philo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " She 's our only . " And through all this , the girl Sophia spoke not a word . " I will return in the morning , " Paulus said . The ruse had cost him a day , and cost him , too , any chance of a better meal than jerky eaten under a tree . Paulus had started back to the manor house , then veered away from the road into a copse of beech and spruce . He had already lied more that day than during the previous ten years , and could no more maintain his fabrications than strike down young Sophia of Branchefort Valley in her father 's presence . So he hobbled his horse , found dry ground beneath the spreading branches of a spruce tree , and prayed until sleep came . Then he dreamed of his mother , refusing to look at him as he craned his neck to see through the wagon gate and cried out Mama , good-bye , Mama . In the morning , Sophia was waiting in the lambskin coat Philo had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and she held a small satchel in both hands . Philo and her mother stood behind her , each with a hand on her , the woman 's hand moved to smooth the coat 's collar , tug a tangle out of Sophia 's hair . Philo reached down and took his daughter 's hand . " May she write us ? " the woman said . " After a year , ma'am , " answered Paulus . " Should she prove unsuitable , I will bring her back myself , with no dishonor to you . It 's many a child is n't meant for the wizards " service . " " Not unsuitable , not our Sophia , " Philo said . He swallowed . " Philo , " Paulus said . " Can you spare this coat ? She will be warm on the journey . " " I 'd like her to have it , " Philo said . " It 's all we can give her . " Paulus could come up with no convincing reply . " There 's fresh eggs and bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank you , ma'am , " Paulus said . " I am Paulus . Your man and I met yesterday . " " I am Clio , sir , " she said . She was looking hard at him - seeing , Paulus knew , the scars on his hands and the long sword on his right hip . " Your daughter has her destiny , Clio , " Paulus said . " I am here to take her to it . " Baby turtles , he told himself . Another might have killed all three by now , and moved on . The thought gave him no ease . He averted his eyes as Philo and Clio made their farewells . Braver than either , Sophia took Paulus " hand and climbed onto the saddle in front of him . A tremor ran through her small body , but she reached out to get her fists into the horse 's mane . She looked back at her parents as Paulus spurred the horse northward , and he wondered what she saw . When she spoke , much later when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Paulus did n't register her voice at first . He was thinking about the boy who had been feeding his pig when Myros came . How easily children died . " Sir ? " the girl said . " What do you call the horse ? " " I never named him , " Paulus said . " Can I call him Brown ? " " All right . " " Your name is Brown , " Sophia told the horse . He could kill her at any time , could have killed her at any moment since crossing the pass . Could , for that matter , have cut her down with the empty bucket in her hands while her father was drawing water . Hesitation kills , Paulus thought . " What are the wizards like ? " she asked . " They are wizards , " Paulus said . " Not like men . But not cruel . " " How long until we get there ? " " A little while yet , " Paulus said . He was silent after that , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early and forced them to make camp while the sky above was still light . At times , Paulus knew , he was slow to apprehend the consequences of his actions . Now he realized that he had complicated his task first by concocting a story and then by taking the girl . She was one of the apprentice 's six ; Myros might well know that Paulus had her , and if he also knew about the boy he might be provoked into retaliation . Better to have killed her quickly and ridden on . Regardless of the wizard 's injunction , Paulus could not afford to carry her with him in his pursuit of Myros . Nor could he return her , now that his mouth had run away with his reason and pronounced that she might be returned if she did not satisfy the wizards . He could easily imagine what such a stigma might mean to a child in a place like Branchefort Valley . He stirred Philo 's eggs over the fire and damned himself for losing sight of his task . Over the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying quietly . End this , he thought , and rose into a crouch . " I 'm afraid , " she said , and the sound of her voice destroyed his resolve . He sat next to her . Paulus had no knowledge of children . He had none of his own and had been taken from his own home at about Sophia 's age , leaving behind three younger sisters whom he had never seen again . " Never been out of the valley before ? " he asked her . She shook her head and wiped at her nose before tearing a piece of bread from the loaf and scooping eggs out of the bowl . Cowardice was a thick , bitter syrup in Paulus " throat . The boy with the stick in his hand had fallen without a sound , face still bearing traces of his smile at seeing Paulus " sword - yet Paulus knew that in the dying reaches of the boy 's brain had been the knowledge of his murder . He found that he could not bear the idea of Sophia dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I had not learned her name .... " Let me tell you a story , " Paulus said , and then he fell silent because he could n't remember any stories . He remembered the sound of his father 's voice telling him stories when he was a small boy , but he could n't hear any of the words . " There was a little girl who dreamed that she was a bird , " he began , and he let his voice follow the idea of that bird until Sophia was asleep . In the morning he buried the crusts of the bread with her , and burned the coat over her grave . As he climbed out of the canyon into sunlight , a wind sharp with snow raised gooseflesh on his arms . He filled his lungs and held his breath until the edges of his vision faded into red , then exhaled slowly , slowly , feeling his mind start to fade . At the point of unconsciousness he let himself breathe again , deeply and freely . He did not remember where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as his horse - Brown - picked his way across frosted scree below a peak like the head of a boil , Paulus let his mind wander . During the short time he had slept the night before , he had dreamed of being a dog , in a warm room with thick rugs and two great stone chairs too high for him to leap onto . There had been a kind woman and an old , old man , and another man who would not look at him but spoke gently . O queen , he thought ; and after that , O brother . The motion of a hare bounding between rocks drew his attention . He slipped an old throwing knife from its sheath at the small of his back and waited for it to move again , thinking that now he was over the first high ridge of peaks and in this expanse of alpine valleys , game would be more plentiful . In the high country , above treeline , was nothing but pikas and the occasional adventuresome goat . He wished he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had ever mistaken him for a skillful archer ; his boyhood circus training , though , had served him well where knives were concerned . When the hare made its move , Paulus flicked his wrist . Simple . Five minutes later , the hare was dressed and dangling from his saddle . He rode on , trying not to think of sopping up the hare 's fat with Sophia 's bread . Skill with knives or no , Paulus knew that hunger was going to be a close companion as he moved farther from settled regions . The hermits and occasional isolated hamlets huddled in the valleys would not all be as hospitable as the Brancheforts had been . Sparser settlement also meant that it would be harder to track Myros - although Myros would have his own problems , chief among them finding four more children to collect . Paulus had no doubt that all six of Myros " collection would be children , and the certainty had come so quietly that he was reluctant to examine it too closely . He mistrusted his own intuition , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid the wizard to make him forget , and he feared breaking the spell by looking too closely at the workings of his mind . There was the problem , too , of where Myros was going - and why . Moving north as fast as feet could carry him , moving deeper and deeper into the winter that had already left the lowlands , Myros fled as if frantic to go backward in time . If he kept heading north , he would reach the marshes and tundras that gave onto the ice-choked Mare Ultima . What would Myros want with the tribes who followed the whales and caribou ? A stirring in Paulus " mind set his fingers tingling with more than the cold . I can block the memories of your mind , the wizard had said , but the body 's memories are beyond my reach . Paulus looked at his hands and wondered what they remembered . He had paid good silver for his forgetfulness , but no wizard had yet charmed the curiosity out of man or woman , or the desire . Paulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PASSED , and fell from memory with the sunset . Paulus saw no one , and stopped remembering his dreams . He was well into the second range of mountains , leading Brown on a foot trail skirting snow-buried canyons , when he found the apprentice 's third . He saw smoke funneling out of a crevice on the canyon wall , and found a cave entrance below it . Calling in , he roused an old hermit and described Myros . " Yes , " the hermit nodded , and invited Paulus in for hot water and flat bread . " He was here . And yes , he spoke to my lad and moved on . Quite a soft one to be this deep in the mountains . " Paulus thought , but did not say , that there were many kinds of hardness . " And he would not eat , nor drink , " the hermit went on . Paulus watched his fingers , how they moved through the silent catechism of the hermit 's god . Nine beads on a catgut string , a sacred abacus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , Paulus thought . Not now . " I thank you for your welcome , " he said . The hermit did not acknowledge this . " Wizards , " he grumbled , and spat into the fire . " Myros is not yet a wizard , " Paulus said . " I am sent to make sure he never will be . " In the hermit 's eyes , Paulus saw suspicion . And something else ; their expression teased at a memory , irritating like a hair on the back of the tongue . Eyes like gray stones , they put him in mind of something , stirred echoes of a kind of love that he could not remember feeling since he was a boy . " If you are following him , " the hermit said , " what does it matter whether he spoke to my lad ? " You have not been gone from inhabited places as long as all that , old man , thought Paulus . " I need to know if he is collecting , " he said , and might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and at the same time someone caught hold of his hair from behind . He threw a forearm across his throat and felt the impact of the blade , and then burning as the hermit kicked the embers of the fire across his leggings . Paulus scissored his legs , scattering the coals back toward the hermit , and with his left hand gripped the wrist of whoever had hold of his hair . The blade caught him on the cheek , and with an animal roar he squeezed until he felt bones snap . The grip on his hair loosened , and he pivoted to his feet , twisting the arm and breaking it again before he saw that he held a longhaired boy of perhaps thirteen , face twisted with hate and fear and pain . Paulus let him go , and the boy sprang up with the knife again . Stepping to his right , Paulus slapped the knife hand down and punched the boy hard on the left temple , knocking him straight down into the packed-earth floor , where he lay motionless save for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paulus saw the hermit brandishing a burning branch . I have tried lies , and I have tried truth , he thought . This time he did not speak at all . li The next morning , in the sunny mouth of a snow cave near a frozen creek , Paulus ran his fingers carefully along his wounds . He had done this the night before , but could not credit what his fingertips reported . His cheek was unmarked , though his tongue felt a chipped molar where the thrust of the boy 's blade had landed , and on his forearm a deep cut ran for three inches or so , then stopped for slightly more , then began again before tapering into a scratch near the outside of his elbow . Paulus probed the skin between the two cuts as he reconstructed the fight in his mind . One blow across the arm , one blow to the cheek , then he had turned . Could he have forgotten a third strike ? It seemed impossible . The uncut skin felt normal to the touch , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could not leave a mark . An odd smell filled his nostrils , raising the hair on his forearms and shrinking his testicles though he could not identify it and did not know why he should be afraid . The forgetting , he thought . Perhaps the body can not forget any more than a bird can forget to fly south . Well . Put it from your mind , he told himself . You paid for the forgetting , and must have had a good reason . More important was the fact that Myros knew he was being pursued . The hermit 's ambush made that clear , and that meant that at the time Paulus had killed the boy on the farm , Myros had not yet collected the hermit 's acolyte . So , Paulus reasoned , I am closing on him , but he will have laid traps where time and circumstances allow . Hesitation kills , and even more fatal is the failure to learn from mistakes . Three of Myros " collection remained . Each , no doubt , would pose more risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underestimated . The time for a budding wizard to gather his collection came near the end of his studies , when he could go no further without the actual performance of magic . Together , the sparks of magic in each of the six merged into a wizard 's strength , and in fact his life , since a wizard lived only as long as one of his collection survived . Paulus was n't sure which would be more difficult , eliminating the six or confronting Myros after he had completed his collection . The apprentice would not have completed his studies , but he would have learned enough in the Agate Tower to be a difficult opponent . Paulus had killed wizards before . He could do it again . He could also fail , and although he did not fear death , he feared dying and believed that knowledge of the difference between the two was the true wellspring of courage . Having taken money from the wizards " guild , however , Paulus knew better than to abandon his mission . He finished the flat bread he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the rabbit , and went on . He came to tundra , and found a thin track that followed the course of a north-flowing river . Memories threatened , and Paulus held his breath until they went away . Five days he walked , eating little and haunted by the prospect of remembering . Often he thought of his brother , dead these four years , and of the strange sacrifice his brother had made . More often still he thought of the king whose father had killed Paulus " father , and who had taken Paulus into his service and transformed him from an acrobat into the man he now was . Something slippery and vast remained just out of reach in his mind , and although he fought the impulse , he could not help grasping after it . Nor could he help tracking his fingers across the blank patch of skin between the two healing cuts , or the bearded cheek that had not parted for the acolyte 's dagger . The magic is faltering , he thought , and was glad that he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complete as well . A village of thatched huts hugged the sandy inside of a bend in the river . Four men came out to meet him , careful not to point their spears too directly at him , and speaking a language that Paulus knew only in fragments from fellow soldiers . They recognized the sigil of the king on the hilt of his sword , and the figure of the Agate Tower on the medallion tied to Brown 's bridle , and when he asked about the apprentice who wore a ring over his glove they nodded and pointed to a lean-to of driftwood and sod downstream of the village . When he knocked at the crooked sticks of the door , it fell in , and before Paulus could draw his sword he was set upon by dogs . A ringing rose in his ears and he killed them , one at a time while the others tore at his legs and leapt snarling at his face . Before they were all dead a spear struck a glancing blow across the back of his head , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used its body as a shield to catch the thrust of the next spear . He twisted the dog 's body , jerking the spear from the hands of the villager who had held it , and killed him . The other three spread into a semicircle around him . Blood warm on the banRbf his neck , Paulus said , " He was dead when Myros came here and you did not set your dogs on him . Where is he ? " The answer was three spears , driven at once toward his gut . He stepped to his left , between two of them , and struck down the two villagers before they could regain their balance . " You 're not killing caribou now , " Paulus said to the last of them . " Leave off . " It was n't working . Paulus looked into the last man 's face and saw a look he had come to know well in his days with the king 's army . May I never come to the point , he prayed , when I am willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my failure to kill myself uselessly . A shouting pierced the ringing in his ears , and he looked to his left , upstream , where an old man and a younger woman stood with two children , a boy and a girl . Naked . Twins . The children stared wide-eyed at Paulus , streaked in blood and holding the carcass of a dog . They stared at the three dead men sprawled around him , and at the dead dogs fanning out from the open doorway of the driftwood lean-to . Their expressions did not change as the elder , standing behind them and looking Paulus in the eye , held up a bone knife and cut their throats before the eyes of the village . First the girl , then the boy , knelt and looked down at the blood running down their bellies . They put their hands over their wounds . The boy coughed , and sucked in a huge breath before choking blood out of his mouth . The girl 's mouth opened and her tongue came out as if she had tasted something bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out a bloody hand to the ground and used it to guide their bodies down to rest . Something broke inside Paulus . The ringing in his ears disappeared , and he lowered his sword . " They were dead when Myros came , " he repeated . " I am made the instrument of his madness . " In the woman 's eyes was something neither pity nor hate . " Go , " the woman said . Many children I have let live , Paulus thought that night . Other men might have killed them all . And still other men , he answered himself , would have returned the wizards " money before killing the boy with the stick . Again he grasped after the easy justification : Once Myros collected them , they were going to die . Baby turtles . Paulus had been kinder about it than most would have . Still and yet , there were men who made their way in the world without killing children . Paulus prayed to one day be among them . One more . He lay looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thinking : One more . And on into the country of stone and smoke and ice , where men ate seals and great bears ate men . The world is running out of land , Paulus thought . The sixth can not be far . After the hermit 's trap and the ambush laid at the village , he was no longer traveling , but patrolling , eyes and ears sharpened for possible threats , right hand moving restlessly back and forth between Brown 's saddle horn and the pommel of his sword . He caught himself praying under his breath , and wondered with wry humor if this was what it took for him to discover piety . Also he had the feeling that the membrane of his forgetting was growing dangerously thin , as if the part of his mind veiled by magic was speaking to him , more loudly and insistently with each hour he traveled north . I have been here before , he thought - and held his breath until the world grew purplish at the edges and he felt himself swaying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smells of northern plants awakening to the promise of summer 's endless days , Paulus came upon a farmer plowing . Pulling his own blade , the man bent to his work , shiftless and running with sweat even in the chill air . Paulus rode to him , sword drawn and leveled . When the farmer looked up , he asked , " Has a young man with a ring over his glove passed this way ? " The farmer let the handles of his plow drop and squinted up at Paulus . " It 's you , " he said . Paulus raised his sword , and would have killed the fanner except the man spoke his name . " How do you know my name ? " he asked . " Was it Myros who told you ? " " Do you - it has n't been that long . " " Since what ? " The farmer cocked his head . " You do n't remember me , either , do you ? Will ? " " Why would I ? " " Oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , did n't you ? " Paulus " sword point dipped in Will 's direction . " Paulus , " Will said . " Your apprentice was here , yesterday , and he did collect a boy . But there 's more you need to know . " " No , there is n't , " Paulus said . " I do n't know how you know me , or if you know me or if Myros left you this part to play . None of that matters . Take me to the boy . " " Well , I was going to do that , " Will said . " After all , he 's yours . " The membrane stretched thinner , and then Will added , " From Joy . When you came to kill the dragon . " And Paulus remembered . When he tried to sleep , he heard the dragon . The whisper of its scales , their soft scrape and rattle . The cold draft of its indrawn breath , so like the breath of a cave . The slow creak of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ghost of his bitter triumph scratching its way through the inside of his mind . He rolled over , felt the mattress under him : so soft , softer than the wintry mountainside where he 'd camped the night before he 'd gone into the dragon 's lair . In a corner of his chamber , a mouse scampered . There were hours yet before dawn . He threw back the sheet and stood . In the courtyard below his window , the bucket hung over the well swung in the night wind . A light shone in the stables , and Paulus shrugged into a robe . The groom , Andrew , rarely slept and had grown accustomed to Paulus " intrusions in the middle of the night . Before going down to the stables , Paulus rummaged in the dark for the bottle on his nightstand . Better to bring a gift when interrupting another man 's solitude . Andrew looked up at the squeak of the stable door 's hinges . " Paulus , " he said . Paulus set the bottle on the square table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " The dragon again , " he said . Paulus sat heavily on the cutting bench . Killing the dragon : the shock of the blade driven at an angle below the scales behind its shoulder , the scalding spray of blood over his hands and face ( no blade can cut his face now , nor a long irregular patch of skin on the inside of his right fofearm where the seam of his jerkin had split ) , the long ropes of skin and muscle hanging from Paulus " flanks and legs where its claws had raked him , the sight of his own bones . And then the woman who put him on a sledge and dragged him to her hearth , where the winter passed into spring without him remembering , and in the spring when he was strong again he desired her , and would have taken her back to The Fells ; but although she gave freely of her body and her love , she would not leave her birthplace . So he had come back , and slept little and drunk much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew at the tack bench , until with the last of the bounty on the dragon he had purchased his forgetting . Paulus woke . In her language , her name meant Joy . She had had one man before him , killed the year before , hunting the homed whales among the ice floes of the Mare Ultima . Perhaps she had had none after . He could remember the smell of the cutting bench as if it were in the room with him . The morning after sharing that last bottle with Andrew , he had gone to a spell broker and negotiated the terms of his forgetting . Now he remembered it all again : The pain that crept like worms under his skin as the dragon 's poison did its slow work , the way the screams had fought their way out of his mouth as she dragged him down the hillside and for miles along the riverside trail . The pungency of her remedies , and the spasms of his body as they drew the poisons out . The long silences in her house , broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof and at last the moment when he had caught her hand and said , Come to me . The boy , Paulus thought . The boy now sleeping on his pallet near the farmer 's hearth . He could be mine . I want him to be mine . He could never have imagined himself feeling this . He felt newly full , spilling over , as if the unstoppering of his memory had scoured away other walls . Paulus sat up , sealskin covers falling away from him . He had spoken to the boy the day before , Will hanging back with more discretion than Paulus would have expected . A simple conversation , and when the boy had asked in his pidgin four-year-old way to see Paulus " sword , Paulus knew he did not have it in him to kill this boy . Perhaps it was the fact that he might be killing his own offspring - though that had not stopped a number of men Paulus had known , and even admired-and perhaps it was simply the lesson of this journey . The Book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Lesson . Part of Paulus " attraction to this faith was his life 's own journeying , the travels and travails ; now here was a chapter of the Book incarnate in these four limbs , these two eyes and small voice . The boy did not know that Paulus might be his father . Will had not been so bold . Paulus wanted to tell him , and he burned on the forks of a problem . Duty spoke with the voice he had always heeded ; the dawning reality of kinship , and the small hope he held of being able to face his maker , spoke in quietly unanswerable opposition . Paulus remembered sunrises slanting in through the cobwebby windows of Andrew 's tack shed . Had Andrew ever seen Paulus on the streets of The Fells , thought to hail him perhaps ? Had he told Andrew of his plan to buy the forgetting ? The sun was not yet up . Will was moving around just outside the door , and Paulus could hear the deep , even breaths of the boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulus stretched . He had not slept under a roof in more than a month , and his body was aging past the point when it could easily absorb a month on the campaign . The scars along his ribs hurt , and his shoulders popped , and in an instant of quiet revelation he understood that Myros had collected children , and Paulus had killed them , because Myros wanted the dragon Paulus had killed four years before . Will had a copy of the Book on a tree-stump table beside his hearth . It was still too dark to read , but Paulus paged through the Book anyway , soothing himself with the beads in his fingers and the familiar weight and texture of the faith he had known all his life . He thought he was looking for something in the Book , but he did not know what , and when enough light had returned to the sky that he could discern the words , he set the Book aside and went to his saddlebag for whetstone and oil . Sharpening his sword , Paulus imagined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black fury at what the world had done to him . No , he thought . The boy slept as only a child can , still as death , unstirred by the scrape of the whetstone . Memories rode in on the tide of Paulus " anger . In the Book was a story of a girl named Lily , saved by a story whispered in her ear while she was sleeping . Thinking of it , Paulus found his own tongue loosening . A story came to him , and as he remembered it he told it to the boy . 3 LEGEND HAD IT that the commoners " gift of magic came from the gods " anger at the separation of people into high and low . Like all legends , this one was as good an explanation as any , and the kingdom largely subscribed to it . One bit of magic , to be deployed once and only once , whether foolish or wise : this was the commoner 's reward for a lifetime of subservience . The jester found this delicious , and wasted no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the jester had secrets , and reasons . Much of his life was apparent in the topology of his face . The king 's common subjects bore an expression of calm security , a faith in their sovereign and in their one bit of magic to see them through whatever demands life would place upon them . But as if he had been built by one of the angry gods , the jester 's face quirked and twisted with freshly remembered regret , and his cast eye , forever looking vacantly away to his right , took on a horrible aspect when his humor turned scabrous and biting . The younger princes and princesses fled the throne room at his every entrance , pushing each other in most ignoble haste , and the queen reluctantly took action when the youngest prince , awakening in mortal fear from a nightmare of the jester 's crooked eye and whiplash tongue , ran blindly from his room and broke both of his legs in a fall down a flight of stairs . Only a few hours later , in the throne room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memento mon , telling each that the safety of the royal progeny outweighed decades of service and reward . " His loyalty to you speaks well of him , " she said to the king . " Even your dog is not so loyal . " The old dog looked up at her , the tip of his tail twitching . The jester thought that if he had had a tail , it might have twitched as well . The queen spoke more than she knew , and behind his beard the king mused . The jester farted outrageously and refused to say a word , but within the scrawny rack of his chest , his heart beat with both fear and love for the queen who at that moment was proposing that he be pensioned off to a mountain barony safely away from tender gazes . His love for her exceeded the bounds even of his love for ruler and kingdom , and in that moment the jester bitterly regretted the day when he had loosed his one bit of magic to save the king . Outside the castle walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out over the shore of a lake whose surface was rippled like an old window . He was tired of conjuring witty deflating comments . Tired of handstands , tired of juggling the skulls of the king 's would-be assassins . He 'd grown old , found aches in his joints and sleepless nights at the end of every day . There were many things he wished had never happened . The jester had not always been a jester , any more than the king had been a king or the king 's dog had been a dog . The day the old king died , the crown prince sat a silent vigil by his father 's body until midnight , when he leapt to his feet and went to the chamber door . " Tomorrow a barred door closes on me , " he said to his guard . " Tonight I walk through my city . " In the marketplace the uncrowned king walked among his subjects . He flirted with shop girls , bought perhaps one too many flagons of wine , and found himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street performers . They were tired and performed reluctantly , but he gave them the strength of gold thrown at their feet . When the first birds had begun to chirp in anticipation of the dawn , the pair of acrobats were still turning their tumbles and mining their repertoire for tricks this munificent stranger had not yet seen . Few things travel faster than news of a king 's death , and the two weary acrobats were attuned to town gossip as only itinerant clowns can be . The ohkr brother had absorbed the news and let it find a resting place in his mind ; the younger had grown consumed with desire to avenge an injustice perpetrated by the dead king many years before , when an unlucky circus ringmaster had made an inopportune comment about the old king 's cleft palate . One thing that travels faster than news of royal death is tidings of royal insult , and before long the ringmaster had vanished into the castle dungeon as his two boys performed with masklike faces before their sovereign , who rose at the end to pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . The older son had made his peace with this . One lived in one 's world , and one did not insult the king . The younger , though , turned the injustice inward and fed on it , not realizing that it was also feeding on him . Over a span of ten years man and hatred grew more to look like one another , and at last on a breezy summer night with dew on the ivy that climbed the city walls , the younger brother , addled with fantasies of regicide , saw his chance for revenge . It would be their final routine , the brothers told their sole watcher . Dawn was coming , and besides they knew no trick to better it . The uncrowned king accepted this . " I have been well entertained , " he said , " and who better than you to know when you have no more to give ? " Nodding , the brothers unfolded a leather package containing ten knives . " Ready ? " the older asked . " We should rehearse it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The king could n't be certain whether the clowns were really so uncertain of this routine , or whether the uncertainty was part of their patter . Predawn gleam flashed on the knife blades as they flickered between the two brothers in a pattern almost intelligible . " Marvelous , " the king said . " I imagine that 's dangerous given your eye . Can you see out of it ? " Only for a moment , an eyeblink or even less , a long-dormant sense of hurt bloomed in the older brother . His life had given him a keen sense of irony , and it never escaped his notice when audiences tossed comments toward him of the sort that had gotten his father killed . The pain passed almost immediately , but not before causing a tremor in his throwing hand . Blades clashed as the younger brother knocked the errant throw from the air . " Careful , brother , " he said . The older brother blinked . " Well enough , " he lied . " I see well enough . " Six knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger brother said , " Now four . Now . " Together they stooped , and the gleaming pattern between them recomplicated itself just long enough for the king to think Masterful . Then the younger brother cried out and dropped his knives in a clatter . One of them bounded toward the king , who reached to pick it up . " Not to worry , Your Majesty , " the younger brother said . He stooped to retrieve the knife , and just as it registered in the king 's mind that this slim and smiling trickster knew who he was - had watched him from crowds since he was old enough to assume the paste crown of First Successor - the younger brother leaned in low and thrust the knife into the king 's belly . What should have followed then was a lingering death and a hasty scampering escape over the city walls , but the uncrowned king was not quite the fool the younger acrobat had thought him . His mail shin , forged within subterranean earshot of the cell where the old ringmaster had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with only an inch of its tip parting skin and muscle . The younger brother 's weight bore the king over , and he lay on his back , struggling to catch his breath and looking calmly into the eyes of his assassin . " This blood , " the younger brother said , holding his cut hand so the blood dripped onto the king 's face . " It is my father 's , and I will avenge it . " He drew another knife from his belt . " You are older than I am , " the king said . " I do not know your father . Your grievance is with a dead man . " " When you are dead , " the younger brother said , " I will have no grievance . " He planted one knee in the king 's chest . His brother called his name . " Kill me , then , " said the king . " But know that you redress no wrong . You kill as a mad dog kills , because you do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , or perhaps magic saw its opportunity and spoke through his elder sibling 's mouth ; but before the knife could fall the older brother said , " You will not be a mad dog , brother . You will not repay shame with shame . " With those words , his life 's one bit of magic whirlpooled from his body , and where a moment before the king had lain helpless under an assassin 's knife , now the older brother watched as a small brown dog pawed at the king 's tunic and strained to lick his chin . The king pushed the dog aside and with a disgusted noise jerked the knife from the broken links of his mail . " Did you know who I was ? " he asked . The remaining brother , three knives in his two dangling hands , shook his head . " It is odd , " the king said , and had to pause for breath . He struggled to his feet . " To thank a man who would turn his brother into a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who killed my father , " the older brother replied . The king looked from the older brother to the attentive dog , who limped ever so slightly on one front paw . " So , " he said . " But I have seen men die , and few were able to face it as you did , " the older brother went on . He began to gather up his props and gimmicks . " I thought I saw a kingly man in you . " He tried to say something more , but he could not speak of what he had done . The dog sat in front of the king . His tail wagged against one of the fallen knives , and he started up at the clatter and ran a few steps before returning with tail and nose both low to the ground . " Take care of my brother , " said the lone acrobat as he shouldered his pack . " I see he wishes to remain with you . " " Why should I not kill him ? " The acrobat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not with a dog . " Dawn broke on the castle 's highest towers . " True , " said the king . " Very well , he will remain with me . As will you . I will have you and your brother at my throne , one to remind me of how close to death I came , and the other to remind me of why I was allowed to live . Walk with me , king 's jester . " All of this was bad enough ; but then the jester fell in love with the queen . He remembered the moment of falling in love like a story told by someone else . The great stones of the hall outside the throne room , pale gray except streaks on either side , where generations of the royal wolfhounds had rubbed their ears along the grooves and ridges in the ancient stones . This king , whose life the jester had saved , was the first in memory to keep a limping brown dog of anonymous pedigree instead of the great loping hounds named for stars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller by a head and younger by two generations , he favoring a heel bruised earlier that day tumbling for an ambassador . She with hair the color of the old streaks in the walls , a brown almost black , and eyes the color of the untouched stones , the gray of a cloud heavy with lightning ; he with a balding head and knuckles swollen by winter 's chill . The jester became exalted in that moment , realizing that she was the castle , she was the kingdom , it was the twin example of her kindness and her iron rectitude that made it possible for the king to spare the jester 's brother . He loved her because she seemed in that moment to him like an ideal given flesh , an ideal for which the sacrifice of a brother was not too great . Foolish , yes , and sentimental : but as good an explanation as any . It haunted the jester that he had been willing to kill his brother . And he had ; only the fickleness of magic had sped his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the royal heir 's person , his utter lack of resemblance to his father . The old king had been capricious , vindictive , wanton in both kindness and cruelty . His successor remained scrupulous and fair , even generous . Around him the kingdom prospered without war . And I did n't kill my brother , the jester thought . I saved him . I protected him , as an older brother must . The king 's dog was old now , gray around the muzzle and lame in his hind legs . A superstition arose that the king would live only as long as his dog ( no one said this about the jester ) , and although the king knew better , still he protected the dog 's life as jealously as his own , lest its death provoke unrest in the kingdom . The irony of this kept the jester in fine form for the mordant humor expected of him at court . What would happen , he wondered , if the king were actually persuaded to foist him off on some rustic baron ? Sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother leak between the royal lips ? And would n't the queen ... ? The duty of her heart was to her husband , and of her mind to her king . She would have the dog killed out of a kind of loathing mercy , pitying the beast its lost humanity even as she ordered it drowned to ensure that no entombed memory would resurface and tear out the throat of the sleeping king . Having once thought this , the jester grew certain events could play out no other way , just as having once seen the queen as his own ideals bodied forth , he could never rid himself of his passion for her . Exaltation fled him . " Why must I love her ? " he demanded of the sky , but the clouds of course took on the color of her eyes and kept their peace . Love twisted inside him the way magic had on its way from his body , anguish and ecstasy . Loving the queen who would kill his brother , the jester could only think of her implacable magnificence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afternoon . The jester left the lake , went back to the city and the castle , and the next day the queen mentioned it again . Would n't the old jester be happier away from the trials and pressures of court ? she asked , slipping through the fissure in his field of vision , and the jester knew what he had to do . The spell broker kept himself secret , but the jester knew where to find him in the twilit side of the city . " My magic is gone , " the jester said . " Else why would you be here ? " the broker said , and displayed brown teeth in a round white face shaved smooth as an egg . " Let me look at you . " The jester kept himself still as the spell broker plucked a strand of his hair and burned it over a candle , traced the outline of his ribs , smelled his breath , looked into his eyes and ears . " What is it you want ? " the broker said upon finishing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jester had heard stories about the deviousness of the spell broker . It was best not to be too specific too soon . " Safety . Magic can not guarantee safety . Magic can sometimes kill a threat , perhaps redirect it . Forgetting-magic is the easiest , though , and the surest . " She could forget , the jester thought . It made him inexplicably sad , though , the idea of court whispers : the queen , forget ? She of the searchlight mind and unshakable will , the gray eyes like stones that held within them memories of each and every soul who passed by ? I will protect my brother . " Forgetting magic , yes , " the jester said . " If it is the easiest , it must come cheaply . " " The cheapest magic comes dear , " said the broker . " Name your price . " " Your eye . " " Very well , " the jester said , and in a sudden panic thought too soon , spoke too soon , because the broker was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Your left eye . " My good eye , the jester thought . How will I look on the queen ? But his mouth was already open saying yes . He found he could look upon the queen , after a fashion . If he positioned himself correctly , she would , on her way to kiss the king , walk through the part of his world that had not faded to a lifeless fog . He could not see her clearly , only well enough to remember how she had once appeared to him . Well enough . I did this for you , he would whisper sometimes under his breath . So you would not feel betrayed when you discovered what I have done for my brother . In the jester 's thirty-seventh year , when the dog his brother was thirty-three , the king had retired him from acrobatics , and the jester passed his days in excremental assaults on courtiers even as he kept his head turned slightly away to the left of the queen . The court thought him blind in the right eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seemly deference to the queen 's presence . They imagined that this deference arose out of gratitude at being permitted to remain at court , and the queen 's stature increased among the aristocratic gossips , her reputation for kindness burnishing the well-known brilliance of her mind and the much-praised symmetry of her face . She often stooped to pet the old dog , who would thump his tail against the leg of the throne at her approach . The jester kept his secrets , and he was careful around the children . The broker 's spell made no guarantee against the queen 's remembering . If he pitied himself from time to time , he ran his fingers where the queen 's had been , along the dog his brother 's neck , and he said to himself , unable to stop : One lives in one 's world , he said to the sleeping dog . One lives in one 's world . 4 THE BOY STILL **26;3928;TOOLONG outside . " You 're not blind , " he said . " I 'm not a dog , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Book aside . Will lit his pipe . " Twice someone spent their magic on you ? " " Aye , " Paulus said . " Twice . " " And how did the second come about ? " " You would n't believe me , " Paulus said . " Already I do n't believe you , " Will said . " Tell another one . " " My brother confessed to the queen and as a reward for the laughter he had brought to the court , she bought me back my shape as a man , on the condition that I enter the king 's service . I fought eleven years in the king 's wars , and then he sent me to kill the dragon . When I came back , my brother and the king had both died , and I was released . Since then I have been for hire . " Will blew smoke rings over the sleeping boy . " All of this after you tried to kill the king ? Ha , " he said . " I wish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three times , actually , Paulus thought . The forgetting he 'd bought four years ago in The Fells was the third . Paulus made an occasional pastime of imagining who that little bit of magic had come from : a gambler needing to cover a debt , a soldier wanting a woman , a merchant whose cargo had foundered in the straits . Perhaps even the woman who had borne this child who might be his . The brokers of The Fells moved through the hamlets and farms of the mountains , following the lucrative scents of poverty and desperation . Their prices were n't fair , but even a rapacious deal often made the difference between feeding children and selling them . " Three years ago ? " he asked . " Four , in the fall . " " How ? " Will shrugged . " She was bringing water . Sat down for a rest beside the path , I guess , and I found her when I heard the boy crying . Maybe six months old , he was . " Could be , Paulus thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms drawn in under his chin , still shadowed from the sunlight falling through the hut 's single window . Firelight glowed in the tangles of his hair . Paulus thought he might see something of himself in the shape of the boy 's shoulders , the line of his jaw . Today I must kill Myros , he thought . Because if I do not , I will have to kill this boy , and I can not . " Have you named him ? Had she ? " " She called him after you , " WiU said . " So I did , too . " Paulus was brimful and shattering . A boy with my name , he thought . After all this , all the leavings and the years with no place to call my own , in my fiftieth year I ride out on a mission of killing and find a boy with my name . It was written in the Book : Let the Lesson be . He stood , and his knees cracked . " Today this ends , " Paulus said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , tell him I will return by nightfall or not at all . " The boy . Still , Paulus admonished himself , you can not call him by his name ? He walked the final steps of his Agate Tower errand , his body leading him to the dragon 's cave as if his scars were lines on a map . It would have taken Myros some time to prepare the spell to control the dragon , and more time yet for him to gather his courage and enter the cave when the dragon did not come out . Quite a string of surprises Myros was in for , Paulus thought , and bared his teeth as he wound up a switchbacking footpath that ended on the ridge above the cave . He made no effort to disguise his presence . If Myros had already spent his energy on the spell , then he was just another baby turtle ; if he had not , Paulus was in for a hard fight , but on this day he would kill no man from behind . He crested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memories . The cave mouth , like a half-lidded eye , was the same , yet it seemed smaller to him , the smell of the snow on the north side of the ridge made him think of ice storms rattling against a window with a sound like the rasp of the dragon 's scales . They were all before him now , the specters of those gone from his life : his brother , Andrew , his mother , the king . Men he had served with . Joy . And the boy she had named for him . When Paulus opened his eyes , Myros was looking at him from the cave entrance . " For this you made me kill children , " Paulus said . " I made you do nothing , " Myros said , and made a gesture with his ringed hand . Paulus was alight with pain : every blade that had ever cut him cut him anew . He felt the teeth of dogs and the dragon 's talons , the piercing of an arrow and the grate of a spearpoint across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootheels ground his fingers . He dropped his sword and felt his knees buckle . Blood roared in his ears , and somewhere beyond it he heard Myros " footsteps on the stones of the trail . Looking up through tears , he saw the apprentice coming nearer . You misjudge me , Paulus thought , and drank of his pain until it had given him strength to stand , and when he had gotten to his feet he left his sword where it lay and fell upon Myros with bare hands . When it was done , he lay gasping on the stony ground as the apprentice 's spell slowly faded from his body . He felt as if he was being knit together again , and when the pain had faded into the leaden dullness that for Paulus always followed killing , he got to his feet . Leaving his sword where it lay , he walked a short distance into the cave , to the point where the light from without finally failed . Trailing away into the dark , the bones of the dragon had already begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One more , Paulus remembered thinking . I was right , and I was wrong . It was afternoon when he returned to Will 's farm . The boy was on his hands and knees following an insect through the beaten grass . He looked up at Paulus " approach and stood . " There 's a beetle there , " he said . Paulus knew in that moment how little he understood of children , and how enormous his task was . " Your name is Paulus . Is that right ? " he asked . The boy nodded , but his attention was already wandering back to the beetle . He parted the grasses looking for it . " My name is Paulus too . " The boy looked over his shoulder at Paulus . Where , Paulus wondered ? A place without wizards . A place without these bargains driven for your soul . A place where my boy will not follow my path . He realized he had forgotten his sword , and resolved that he would never wear another . Let the Lesson be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And the boy said , " Where are we going ?
