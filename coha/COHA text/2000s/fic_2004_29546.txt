Tempted By Pamela Britton Warner Books Pamela Britton-Baer No red cape . No pitchfork . No horns . All in all Mary Brown Callahan would say that the Devil Marquis of Warrick did n't look a thing like she expected . Oddly enough , she felt disappointment . Of course , she could n't see his lordship all that well what with him sitting upon a bleedin ' throne of a chair behind his bleedin ' monstrosity of a desk . " Please have a seat , " he said without looking up , his eyes firmly fixed upon a document before him , a clock on a mantel behind him tick-tick-ticking in an annoyingly sterile way . Somewhere off in the distance another clock chimed the quarter hour , the bong-ding-dong-dong finding its way into the room . Muted sunlight from the right reflected off the flawless , polished perfection of his desk . The ink-blotter lay exactly square , almost as if someone had used a measuring tape to place it . Papers were stacked at perfect right angles . A fragrant , rather obnoxious-smelling truss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made Mary long to reach forward and mess it all up . Instead , she took a seat , nearly yelping when the plush blue velvet did its best to swallow her like she were Jonah and the chair a whale . She jerked forward , lookingup to see if his lordship had noticed . No . The swell were still engrossed in his work . Hmph . She waited for him . Then waited some more . Finally , she began to tap her foot impatiently , her toe ticking on the floor in time with the clock ... quite a merry beat when one got into the tapping of it . The scratching of his quill abruptly stopped . His head slowly lifted . Two things hit Mary at once . One , Alexander Drummond , Marquis of Warrick , had the prettiest eyes she 'd ever seen , blue they were , the color of a seashell when you turned it upside down . Two , he was not the ugly ogre she 'd been expecting , which just went to show a body should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those words came from her silly baboon of a father , Tobias Brown . His lordship blinked at her , frowned , then said , " I 'll be with you in just a moment , " slowly and succinctly-as if she had a whole hide of wool in her ears-before going back to work . She narrowed her eyes . Would he now ? Well la-de-da . His high-and-mightiness were right full of himself , was n't he , in his fitted jacket made of a black wool woven so tight , the fabric looked as shiny and as soft as a well-bred horse 's coat . His cravat was n't tied as intricately as some of those she 'd seen-those worn by the dandies who strolled up and down Bond Street with silver-tipped walking sticks that they jabbed into the ground like the very earth offended them . No , his lordship 's cravat was simply tied , seeming to cup the chin of what was a very handsome face . No sense in denying it . Nothing slug-faced about it , which was how most lords looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin that was almost square , his nose not at all large and aquiline , but rather narrow and-could it be-a bit crooked ? Above the eyes that she 'd noted before sprang midnight black hair with strands of gray that peppered the bulk of it , those strands pulled back in a queue , the whole combining to form a face that would make a bold woman stare and a shy woman blush . " Did your daughter give you that ? " she found herself asking , more because she wanted to look into his extraordinary face again , rather than down the edge of it . And so once again he looked up . His quill stopped its annoying scratch , the black jacket he wore tightening as he straightened . Thick , very masculine brows lowered . " I beg your pardon ? " " The gray hair , " she said , pointing with a gloved hand at his hair , and then motioning to her own carrots in case he needed further clarification . And now those black brows lifted . " As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait inherited from my father . All Drummond men have it . " She pursed her lips , liking the way his voice sounded . Low and deep and perfectly controlled , as if each syllable was measured and weighed before let loose on the world . " Only the men ? What would you do if a woman were born with it ? Strangle the lass ? " His lips parted . His jaw dropped , but he was only struck all-a-mort for a moment . Too bad . " No , Mrs .... " He looked down , his white cravat all but poking him in the chin as he pulled sheets of papers toward him . She recognized them as the ones John Lasker had forged . John had the best penmanship in Hollowbrook . " Mrs. Callahan . We do not shoot our children . " Got his ballocks in a press , had n't she ? Hah . She almost smiled . " And , " he continued , " Since it would appear as if you 're determined to interrupt me , I suppose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , you can be on your way , and I can return to my work . " Mary perked up . At last . Two , maybe three minutes and she 'd be out of his lordship 's home . For one thing Mary Callahan did n't want , and that was to nurse his daughter . No , indeed . She 'd sooner let those fancy gents what practiced with their pistols down by the Thames use her for target practice . She 'd only come to appease her monkey-brained father , a man who 'd gone a wee bit crackers with his plot of revenge against the marquis . ( Although now that she 'd met the man , she could well understand her father 's aversion to the cull . ) No , indeed . She 'd do everything in her power to thwart that sap-skulled fool , that she silently vowed . And then she 'd return to her real job , which was a fair way from St. James Square . " I see you 're from Wellburn , Mrs. Callahan . " She leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pretended to look at the papers . He smelled nice , almost like cinnamon , which made her wonder if he 'd used the spice in that fancy coffee of his , the one whose smell she could still catch if she inhaled deeply enough , which she did , which he must have heard because his brows lifted again . Next he looked at her arm , up at her , then at the arm again . Pointedly . " Is that wha ' it says ? " she asked , not removing her elbow , and not trying to smooth her Cockney accent , something she could do , if she had a mind to . She tilted her head , and Lord knows why , but when their gazes met , she smiled . Mary Callahan had a bonny smile . Truth be told , she had a lot of bonny traits-or so she 'd been told . Fine green eyes . Dimples . And an endearing way of looking at a man from beneath her thick lashes , not that there was any reason to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , did n't appear fazed . " You 're not from Wellburn ? " he asked , his face blank . He had the composure of a corpse . " If that 's what it says , then I suppose I am . " She leaned back , noticing that his eyes darted down a second . Quickly . As if he 'd glanced at her breasts , found them interesting , then looked away again because he could n't believe he 'd done something so common . They were a fine , ripe bushel , though she was surprised his lordship here would be noticing . She 'd have thought that kind of thing was beneath his hoity-toity nose . " You suppose ? " She shrugged , one of the seams in the dress Fanny Goodwin had sewn popping a bit at the shoulder . It was blue with darker blue ribbon trimming the demure , long sleeves , and yet there was nothing demure about it . The bloody thing was sewn in such a way as to lift her breasts and hold them out for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the kitchen just to suit his taste . And perhaps they did for she could have sworn he glanced down again , though he covered it under the guise of moving his gaze to his papers again . " Been travelin ' a lot , " she said . " Hard to keep track . " " I see . " And the words were clipped out : I. See . Gritted teeth . Stiff jaw . Bayonet up his backside . He kept his gaze on the papers . " Do you enjoy being a nurse , Mrs. Callahan ? " " No . " His head snapped up again . He was going to get a bleedin ' neck ache if he kept that up . Up . Down . Up . Down . " No ? " She shook her head . " Ca n't stand children . " She had the rum-eyed pleasure of seeing his mouth drop open . " But it says here you love them . " " Who said that ? " she asked , and she really was curious . Fineas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made John write that down . He had a wicked sense of humor , and saying she liked children was laughable indeed . " Mrs. Thistlewillow . " That explained it . " Mrs. Thistlewillow would claim Beelzebub loved children . " His lordship had fine teeth , she noticed . And she had occasion to study them because his mouth hung open again . Not a rotted one in the lot . " Mrs. Callahan . I get the feeling that you have not read your references . " She snorted . Could n't help it . She 'd no intention of getting hired for the job , so why read forged references ? " I make a point not to read what others say about me . " And she was bloody proud of that fact . She might be a poor smuggler 's daughter . She might be a wee speck on his lordship 's boot heel , but Mary Callahan-lately of the Royal Circus-stood on her own two feet ... literally as the case may be . Damn the rest of the world . He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of the papers on the desk as he said , " Mrs. Callahan . Thank you for coming , but it appears as if a mistake has been ma- " " Papa ! " Mary 's arse fair puckered to the chair . Blimey , what a screech . The door swung open with a resounding boom that rocked all around it , including her eardrums . She swiveled toward the door . At least , she tried to . The bloody chair held her backside down like a Scottish bog . " Papa , Simms says you 're interviewing another nurse . " A little girl of about eight ran by , her hair streaming behind her . Black it was , and in sore need of a good brushing . She landed in a puppyish jumble of arms and legs in her father 's embrace , dust motes circling like buzzards in her wake . " I do n't want a nurse . I told you that . " Ah . The little termagant herself . Mary held her breath as she waited for his lordship to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been about to do before the hellion had come in . " Gabby , " the marquis said . " Be polite and say how do you do to Mrs. Callahan . " Polite ? Bugger it . Mary wanted to leave . " No , " the little girl snapped . " Do it , Gabby . Now . " The little girl drew back , her face only inches away from her father 's . They were practically nose-to-nose , the marquis ' handsome , arrogant face stern and disapproving . Lord , the man could scare kids on All Hallows ' Eve with a look like that . The bantling wiggled on his lap . Then her face turned resigned . She shimmied down , landing with that soft shush of leather soles on fine carpet . The gray dress looked stained with juice , Mary noted , her black slippers that peeked out beneath white petticoats smudged with dirt . But she was a cute little moppet with her father 's startling blue eyes and dark , curly hair that rustled as she moved . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curtsy that somehow seemed , well , mocking . And then she rose , looked sideways out of her eyes , and that cute little moppet with the pretty blue eyes stuck out her tongue . Mary stiffened . And that seemed to be the reaction wanted for the hellion gave her a smug smile . Mary 's eyes narrowed . Never one to be gotten the best of , especially by some pug-nosed whelp , she stuck her tongue out , too . " Papa , " the little girl breathed without missing a beat . " Did you see that ? She stuck her tongue out at me . " Mary looked up at the marquis . What ? Wait a bleedin ' - " Gabby , " he said . " I know well and good that you stuck your tongue out first . Apologize to Mrs. Callahan immediately . " " No , " the little girl snapped , her tiny hands fisting by her sides . " Do it , " he ordered . " No , " she yelled . Mary covered her ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue with her . I 'll lose me hearing . ' T is plain as carriage wheels that she 's not going to apologize . " For the second time that day-the first being the time he 'd caught his first glimpse of the stunning Mrs. Callahan-Alexander Drummond , marquis of Warrick , felt speechless . It defied belief , the things that kept coming out of the nurse 's mouth . Simply defied . " I beg your pardon ? " She arched red brows , and was it his imagination , or did those pretty green eyes of hers narrow ? " She 's not going to apologize . What 's more , I do n't want her bloomin ' apology . Fact is , I do n't want to be her nurse , either . " Alex thought he 'd misheard her again , was even tempted to lift a finger to his ear to clean it out in the event there was something wrong there , but then Gabby said , " Good . Leave , " verifying that the unexpected words had , indeed , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back , rising from her chair . " Sit down , " Alex ordered . Granted , a minute ago he 'd been about to tell the outspoken lady to leave . Now , oddly , he found himself taking her side . " Please , " he added when-good lord-the woman looked ready to defy him . She slowly sat , but she did n't look too pleased about it . " Gabby , you may leave . I will speak with you upstairs . " His daughter 's lips pressed together , something he knew from experience meant a tantrum . " I 'm a bastard , " she yelled in a last-ditch attempt to put the nurse off . Alex winced . He knew the child was inordinately sensitive to the fact that her mother had left her on his doorstep . He could sympathize , still incensed himself that a woman could do such a thing . He looked at Mrs. Callahan to gauge her reaction , but she merely lifted a brow . " Are you now ? " " I am . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Gabby sucked in a breath . " Did you hear that , father ? She said I have poor manners . " " Well , you do , " Mrs. Callahan said . " Do not . " The nurse snorted , the inelegant sound somehow seeming to fit the redoubtable nurse perfectly . " You do n't even know how to curtsy properly . " " Do , too . " " Not by the looks of the one you just gave me . " To Alex 's absolute and utter shock , his obstinate daughter took a step back , straightened , and then gave the nurse a curtsy that would have done her mother proud ... if she 'd had one . " There , " she said upon straightening . Mrs. Callahan wrinkled her tilted nose . " Hmm . I suppose that was a wee bit better , but no proper little girl disobeys her elders . " Gabby glared . So did the nurse . Alex decided he 'd had enough . " Gabby , go to your room . " His daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd thing happened . He saw her stiffen again . Saw her clench her fists . Saw her straighten . " As you wish , Papa . " Alex just about fell off his chair . She turned , gave him a quick , perfect curtsy , nodded to Mrs. Callahan-who , of all things , stuck her tongue out again-then left . Silence dawned . Alex could only stare . " If that 's the way she behaves , ' t is a wonder someone has n't given your daughter a basting . " Her full lips pressed together . " Fair wanted to do it meself . " He blinked , found himself clearing his throat . " Mrs. Continues ... by Pamela Britton
