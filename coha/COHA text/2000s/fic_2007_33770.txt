Chapter One The Killing She ran , tree limbs and brambles scratching , grabbing , tripping , and slapping her as if they were bony hands , reaching for her out of the darkness . The mountainside dropped steeply , and she ran pell-mell , her feet unsure on pine needles and loose stones . She beat at the limbs with flailing arms , looking for the trail , falling over logs , getting up and darting to the left , then the right . A fallen limb caught her ankle , and she fell again . Where was the trail ? Blood . She reeked of it . It was hot and sticky between her fingers . It had soaked through her shirt and splattered on her khaki pants so her clothes clung to her . In her right hand she held a hunting knife in an iron grip , unaware that the tip of the blade was broken off . She had to make it out of these hills . She knew which way she and Cliff had come and where they 'd parked the camper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crying , praying , and babbling , " Let him go , let him go . Oh , Jesus save us ... Go away , let him go , " as she groped her way along , stooping under limbs , clambering over more logs , and pushing her way through tangled thickets in the dark . At last she found the trail , a narrow , hoof-trodden route of dirt and stone descending steeply along the hillside , switch-backing through the tall firs and pines . She followed it carefully , not wanting to get lost again . " Oh , Jesus , " she said . " Oh , Jesus , help me ... " HAROLD BLY had no reputation for mercy and no qualms about dragging his whimpering , pleading wife out of the house , through the front yard , and into the street where he tossed her away with as much respect as he would have given a plastic bag filled with garbage . Maggie Bly tumbled to the street with a yelp , bloodying her palms and elbow on the rough asphalt . Hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blubbery , blue-jeaned mess , her tousled blonde hair hanging over her eyes . With the back of her hand , she swept her hair aside and saw her enraged husband walking away from her , a silhouette against the porch light that formed a glaring , dancing streak through her tears . " Harold ! " she cried . Harold Bly , a tall , barrel-chested man , turned , one foot planted on the top porch step , and deigned to look upon his wife one more time . There was no pity in his eyes . In his midforties and twenty years her senior , he was and had always been a boss man who did not take kindly to betrayals . He 'd enjoyed throwing her into the middle of the street . In fact , he wished she would get up so he could do it again . " It 's all over , Maggie , " he said with a slight shake of his head . " It 's a done deal . " Her eyes widened in terror . Gasping and whimpering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Harold , please ... do n't . I 'm sorry , Harold . I 'm sorry . " " You think you can go two-timing on me and then just say you 're sorry ? " he shouted , then pushed her down the porch steps with such strength that she fell again , letting out a cry the neighbors could hear . " Harold , please do n't make me go . Please ! " " Too late , Maggie , " he said with a wave of his hand as if passing sentence on her . " It 's only a matter of time now , and there 's nothing I can do to stop it . Now you 'd better get out of here , and I mean get way out of here . " He turned to go inside , then added , " I do n't want you around me when it happens . Nobody does . " " But where can I go ? " she cried . " Well , you should 've thought of that a lot sooner . " Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly open , and the wife of a mining company foreman watched the drama while her children watched cartoons on a satellite channel . Two doors down and opposite the Blys ' large , brick home , a miner and his wife cracked open their front door and listened together . " Harold , " they could hear Maggie almost screaming , " do n't leave me out here ! " He was just opening the front door , but he turned once more to stab at her with his finger . " You stay away from me , Maggie ! You come near here , and I 'll kill you , you hear me ? " The front door slammed , and now Maggie was alone in the dark . I hope she does n't come here , the foreman 's wife thought and quickly let go of the lace curtain . The miner and his wife looked at each other , then closed their door quietly , hoping Maggie would n't hear the sound . Maggie wiped away the tears that blurred her vision and looked around the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could go to the Carlsons ... No . She saw the parlor curtains of their turn-of-the-century home being drawn across the windows . The Brannons , perhaps ? No . Across the street , she saw the porch light , then the living room light , of their white house blink out . It was a clear July night , and Maggie realized that most of the neighborhood must have heard the argument . None of the neighbors would open the door to her ; they would n't risk Harold 's wrath . Despite the warmth of the evening , Maggie felt cold , and she folded her arms close to her body . She looked down the steep hill toward the rest of the little , has-been town and felt no warmth from the tight rows of metal-roofed homes and aging businesses . The rooflines with their chimneys looked like night-blackened saw-teeth against the moonlit mountainside beyond . There was hardly a light on anywhere . Suddenly Maggie realized she was a stranger now , and to any stranger , Hyde River could be a cold and sharp-edged place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ran through town , her hand going to her heart as if feeling a deep pain . She looked behind , then ahead , then into the black sky , where stars twinkled benignly between the high mountain ridges . She stared for a long moment at the Hyde Mining Company , an immense concrete citadel just across the river , now black against the sky . In her terror-crazed imagination , the windows of the old building were eyes and the huge doors mouths , and it was sizing her up for a meal . She was sure she even saw it move . She quickened her step , looking over her shoulder , then toward the sky again , as if some unseen monster lurked there . She came to the Hyde River Road , the narrow , two-lane highway that ran through the core of the town and meandered south through thirty miles of deep valley to the town of West Fork , and beyond that , to the outside world . Just a few blocks up the highway , the town put on its best face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down the highway in the opposite direction was the old part of town . It had been through a lot more winters , had hung tough through a century of booms and busts , and made no apologies for its age . Maggie hurried up the highway , toward the newer section of town , through the four-way stop and past the small businesses , the True Value Hardware and the Chevron station , Charlie 's Tavern , still open , and Denning 's Mercantile . Beyond these , the town was a steadily decaying parade of ramshackle homes , boarded-up storefronts , dismembered pickup trucks , and rusted mine equipment . Finally she came to the McCoys ' mobile home , a windowed , metal shoebox with no wheels , perched and sagging on pier blocks and concrete-filled oil drums , the ruined roof now supplemented by heavy blue tarpaulins . Maggie could see Bertha McCoy peering out at her through her kitchen window . When their eyes met , Bertha 's face quickly disappeared . Maggie approached the toy-strewn front yard . Griz and Tony , the McCoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other dogs in the neighborhood barking . A knock on the door by this time would be only a matter of courtesy ; the McCoys had to know someone was there . Maggie knocked , just a few timid taps , and Bertha called from inside , " What do you want ? " " Bertha ? Bertha , it 's Maggie . " " What do you want ? " Maggie hesitated , flustered . What she wanted was nothing she felt comfortable shouting through a door . " Can I talk to you a minute ? " Then came a man 's voice . " Who is it ? " And Bertha 's voice replied , " Maggie Bly . " " What 's she doing here ? " the man 's voice asked . Then the two voices muttered in a hushed discussion while the door remained shut . Finally the man called , " What are you doing here , Maggie ? " " I- " She looked around with fear-widened eyes . " I ca n't stay out here . " " Then go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say it . " - Harold kicked me out . " Elmer McCoy , once a foreman for Hyde Mining , was well acquainted with Harold Bly , and Maggie could hear it in the strained tone of his voice . " Maggie , we 've got no quarrel with either one of you , and we do n't want one now . " Maggie pressed closely against the door as if for protection . All around , the town lay in the cold , gray colors of night , and to her , every darkened window , every shadow , seemed to be hiding something sinister . " Elmer , if you could just let me in for a while ... " She could hear Bertha begging Elmer in a voice that quavered with fear . " Elmer , do n't let her in here ! " " Go away , Maggie ! " he yelled through the door . " Please ... " Elmer 's voice sounded frightened as he said , " Go away , you hear me ? We do n't want your trouble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she was out of sight . EVELYN BENSON stayed on the steep trail for miles , taking step after jarring , downhill step until at last the trail emptied onto the logging road she and Cliff had followed . Having made it this far , her desperation gave way to exhaustion , her knees buckled , and she sank to the ground on the side of the road , too numb with shock to weep , too emotionally spent to pray . By now the blood that soaked her clothing had mingled with sweat , and the night wind drew heat from her body until she began to shiver . " GO AWAY ! " Carlotta Nelson hissed from behind the door of the small , one-story house . " Please , Carlotta ! Let me in . I ca n't stay out here ! " Maggie cried , standing on the front porch and clinging to the knob of the closed door . Carlotta Nelson and Rosie Carson , semicute and not quite young anymore , were still the town 's favorite ladies-and determined to stay that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlotta replied , " not if Harold kicked you out . You ought to know that ! " " Carlotta , I 'm scared ! " Carlotta , her long blonde hair pulled back in a loose braid , exchanged a worried look with Rosie , a petite , freckled redhead . Carlotta had her hand on the doorknob , not to open it , but to be sure it would n't turn . Rosie was near the door only because she could hide behind Carlotta . " Well-well , we 're scared too , you follow ? " she shouted over Carlotta 's shoulder . " Just let me in for the night , " Maggie pleaded . " I 'm dead if I stay out here ! " Dead ? Did she say dead ? Carlotta shot a look of terror at Rosie , and Rosie shot it right back : Only a wooden door stood between them and the worst kind of trouble . " That 's your problem , " Carlotta said , and now her voice was quavering . " And you can take it somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Maggie was weeping again . " Please , let me in . I 'll leave in the morning , I promise ! " Her plea was met with silence . Finally , Maggie turned and , in a stupor of fear , drifted down the porch steps to the main sidewalk , staying close to buildings , cars , and trees , continually looking over her shoulder , toward the sky and down the highway . HAD HE not been forced to slow down due to the poor condition of the road , the trucker would never have seen Evelyn in time . As it was , he had to brake quickly when his headlights caught her , lying like a bloody corpse on the road . He brought his logging rig to a grinding , growling halt about ten feet away from the prone body . As he eased himself down from the cab , the trucker could already feel himself starting to shake . It was dark , he was alone , and there could be more to this situation than he could see in his headlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst : a hunting accident or a bear attack ; maybe a raped , mutilated body dumped by some pervert . He glanced over his shoulder . What if the attacker was still in the area ? " Hello ? " he called tentatively . Evelyn stirred and moaned into the ground . The trucker quickened his step . Reaching her , he stooped down and gently turned her over . She was limp , her eyes closed , her face waxen . He cradled her head and felt her neck . Her pulse was strong , her breathing normal . " Ma'am , can you hear me ? " She awoke with a start . Evelyn was not aware of who she was , where she was , or who was holding her . All that registered in her mind were the truck 's imposing grill , the rumbling diesel engine , and especially , the glaring headlights-they looked like eyes to her . With a terrible shriek , she broke free from the trucker and leapt to her feet , staggering with exhaustion , stained with blood , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the headlights . The trucker , fearful for his own safety , scrambled away from her , away from that blade . Stunned , he stood in the road watching the woman as , with crazed eyes and a cougarlike scream , she assaulted his truck with the knife , shrieking , kicking , lashing at the big machine , the blade clanging over the grill . Then realizing that she was going to hurt herself , the trucker leapt forward and grabbed her , pulling her away from the truck . She kicked and screamed and almost sliced his ear off . VIC MOORE , tall , bearded , and burly , did n't need any trouble either . Finding work in Hyde Valley was n't easy these days , especially for a contractor . Well , he 'd managed to keep food on the table , which said something for his strength and cleverness . He 'd also managed to stay married to the same woman for going on six years , which in itself was quite an accomplishment-and said something for Carlotta Nelson 's ability to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and could only get better from here . At least , that was what he thought until that night . He was just getting ready for bed , standing barechested in front of the bathroom sink , when he noticed what looked like a rash or some broken blood vessels directly over his heart . He leaned toward the mirror , trying to get a better angle to study the strange mark . It seemed to have a lacy , veinlike pattern to it and covered an area over his breastbone an inch or so wide and a little longer than the width of his hand . What in the world was this ? he wondered . From somewhere deep in his memory , an answer surfaced , and the heart just beneath that mark began to pound faster . Vic grabbed the edge of the sink to steady himself . His head began to swim as reason and logic fought against fear and denial . This mark , this blemish , could n't be what he thought it might be . He did n't believe all that stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd just pulled a muscle or something ; broken a couple of blood vessels swinging a hammer or lifting a radial arm saw . He 'd been working hard lately . A loud knock at the front door made him jump . There was a moment of silence , followed by desperate pounding . Dottie , his wife , was in the shower , and he knew she could n't hear the knocking . Vic cursed the bad timing . Who in the world- ? He had to cover himself . He could n't let anyone see-Oh come on , he told himself , just put your shirt on . It 's no big deal . He put on his shirt , which was hanging on a hook on the back of the bathroom door . For good measure , he grabbed his robe , too . The pounding continued , and as Vic crossed his living room toward the front door , tying his robe as he went , he could hear a voice . " Hello ! Hello , please , somebody ! " Uh-oh . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maggie almost knocked him over as she pushed her way inside and held him , practically climbed him in terror . " Vic , let me in , let me in ! " Vic was startled , then angry . " Maggie , what 're you doing ? What is this ? " She held on to him , her eyes fixed on the front door as if something had chased her inside . Her words tumbled out like those of a frightened child . " Vic , you got ta let me stay here , I wo n't be any trouble , let me stay here , please , I ca n't go out there ! "
