1 <br> I could n't cook , but I could sew . It would have been better the other way <br> around . Luelle Morrisey had a face like a mud hen 's backside , but everybody <br> in Mercer County knew she could make a good meal , even at the end of <br> winter , when nothing was left in the root cellar but tired apples . Folks talked <br> about Luelle 's knack for food , and at church socials her pies were bid up past <br> three dollars . " A good cook is good value , " said Ordell Rightsbaugh , one of <br> three ranchers courting her . By the time I was nine years old , I could sew a <br> straight seam , and at fifteen I could make a hem stitch that no one could <br> see , but nobody assigns value to what he ca n't see . <br> I did n't have the right mind for putting meals on the table . Staring <br> into the crusty frying pan and waiting for onions to color , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroll out to lean on the garden fence and look at the dim <br> horizon as if it might have changed in the last ten minutes . The flat dirt , gray- <br> brown , folded into the flat sky , gray-white , and behind me the onions burned . <br> At night Pa poked his fork at my stew , lumps of flour floating next to the <br> shingles of black onion . " If we auctioned you , you would n't bring in as much <br> as a mule , " he said . <br> " More than chickens , though , " I said . <br> " How many chickens ? " <br> " A dozen , easy . I am good value , " I said . <br> " For somebody who already ate , " he said . <br> Meals would have gone better if he 'd just let Mama or one of my <br> sisters cook , but he had ideas about things , and Tuesdays were my cooking <br> days . He thought I 'd learn . My family and the hands , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tuesdays . Me , I was skinny as a whip and <br> could get through the daylight hours on an apple . <br> No matter what Pa would admit , I had my value . I could weigh a <br> spool of thread in my hand and tell if it was rotten at the center . I could stitch <br> a buttonhole in brand-new denim , and I could mend a tear so that it blended <br> right into the cloth around it , invisible even in church when the eye needed <br> something to rest on . <br> There were other values : I was good with people , unlike my shy <br> sisters . When Ernold Brown , who had already put two wives in the ground , <br> twitched and snuffled his way up to Nussine Potter after church service , I saw <br> that he was fixing to marry again . I hiked all the way to his place with a <br> bunch of coneflowers he could bring to Nussine . He gave me a nickel , the <br> first coin I did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough <br> not to tell Pa about it . <br> I was smart about Pa , too , and I could judge when he had drunk <br> one glass of whiskey too many and was itching to hit something . My doughy <br> sisters never learned to clear out of his path , but I could tell a beating was <br> coming the same way that a person can smell rain . " That 's bad-looking <br> leather , " he 'd say , looking at a patched harness . " Cheap . Everything about it <br> looks cheap . " Then he 'd raise his head and say , " It 's not one thing worth a <br> tinker 's damn on this place . " Or in this county , or in this state . The fury would <br> sweep over him like storm clouds . Folks knew him as a joke teller , but he <br> was n't always amiable , and his jokes could turn rough in a hurry . <br> Even Mama , so dim she never seemed to recognize anything , <br> said Pa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was restless all the <br> time , ants under my skin , and a day spent plowing would leave me fretful with <br> wanting something I could n't put a name to . The prairie 's rough grass <br> surrounded us like a belt that kept out soft fabrics , sweet-smelling pillows  --  <br> anything that might ease a life . No wonder Pa drank . When I trudged out to <br> the barn , my eyes cut over our paltry hundred-sixty acres of wheat the same <br> way his did . Everyone around us was buying up acreage before land prices <br> went up again  --  soon ours would be the smallest farm in the county . It did n't <br> need to be so . Pa could have borrowed money to expand . For pity 's sake , <br> the bank was loaning money to the Pecks , who had n't met a payment in five <br> years . The manager would have loaned to us . But Pa looked out to the west <br> toward what he did n't own , what nobody owned . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> He was squinting at the fence line when I came up to him one <br> afternoon . He had put his hat aside somewhere , and the back of his shirt <br> bunched up out of his trousers . The man was careless , shedding things <br> wherever he went  --  shoes and papers and tobacco . Mama spent her life <br> picking up his litter . Myself , I would have let it lie . <br> " Feller dies and goes to the seat of judgment , " he said , eyes <br> trained on the blurred horizon . He did n't even look back to make sure it was <br> me he was talking to . " Jesus says , ' You 've got yourself a bad record . You 've <br> cheated , stolen , lied . You 're going to have to go to hell . ' <br> " Feller falls down at the feet of the Lord . He cries and begs for <br> mercy . ' It 's true that I did n't lead a good life , but I was n't all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the poor . I gave money to your church . ' <br> " The Lord softens . ' All right , ' he says . ' I 'll take mercy on you . You <br> can start again , homesteading in Kansas . ' <br> " Feller stops crying , and looks up at the face of the Lord . ' Is that <br> spot in hell still open ? ' " <br> " Dare you to tell it to the preacher , " I said . <br> " Not everybody wants to hear the truth , " he said . <br> " Preacher says only the Gospel is the truth . " <br> " This is a different gospel , " Pa said . " For those who have ears . " <br> " Dare you to tell it to the visiting preacher . He 's coming to dinner . <br> Mama sent me out to fetch you . " <br> " You 're not cooking , are you ? " <br> " It 's Thursday , " I said . My sister Mae 's turn . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear your Sunday shirt . " <br> " Bad as going to church , " he said . " If I have to wear my Sunday <br> shirt in my own house , maybe I will tell him my joke . " <br> He did n't get a chance , though . Reverend Farley had jokes of his <br> own : the one about the lamb and the peacock , the one about the squirrel who <br> went to Bible camp , the one about the three ministers who went to heaven . <br> After a while , we stopped forcing ourselves to laugh , since our laughter made <br> no difference to the reverend . While Mae 's good pot roast hardened in front of <br> him , he planted an elbow on either side of the plate and said , " Man finds <br> himself at the pearly gates . The Lord says , ' Son , it 's your day of reckoning . <br> You lived a bad life . You smoked , you drank , you did n't do right in business . <br> There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " We know this one , " Pa said . <br> Reverend Farley did n't even pause . " The man says , ' Remember <br> when I saved that widow ? Remember when I ran into the burning house and <br> snatched up the baby ? Does n't that count for something ? ' <br> " The Lord nods . ' You 're right . Those things count for something . <br> You can go to Wichita . ' <br> " The man says , ' Remember that hundred dollars I stole ? ' " <br> Into the quiet around the table , Pa said , " We tell it different . " <br> " I imagine so . Everybody loves this one in Texas . " Mama got up a <br> smile and shook her head . " You 're a regular theater . " <br> " Do you come from Texas ? " I said . Girls in Mercer County did n't <br> talk at the table , and Pa 's glance was sharp . <br> " I travel so much anymore , I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going when the Lord tells me to hang up my spurs , though . " <br> " You 're not wearing spurs , " Pa said . <br> " Where , Reverend ? " said polite Mama . <br> " California . Heaven on earth . " <br> " I do n't imagine that 's part of your circuit , " said Pa . <br> " I was ailing for a time , and I went to Los Angeles to recover my <br> health . I do n't mind telling you , I 'd go back , even if it meant falling sick <br> again . " <br> " What ailed you ? " Pa said . <br> " Tell us about California , " I said at the same time . I could see that <br> my chatter was nettling Pa , but he would n't lay a hand on any of us before <br> company . <br> Reverend Farley put on a sharp smile that did n't look right on a <br> preacher . " If California is not the promised land , it 's the closest we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orange grove is to be in Eden . The air smells sweet <br> and tangy at the same time , and the leaves shine , and the oranges all but <br> push themselves into your hands . Have you ever eaten an orange ? " <br> Pa said , " We see a few luxuries . We 're not poor . " " Your mouth <br> tingles , but the fruit is sweet and so quenching you imagine you 'll never be <br> thirsty again . The flowers are tiny , but they put out a powerful scent . And <br> then you get to the end of the grove , and the next thing you see is the ocean <br> crashing onto sand . " <br> " Salty soil kills most plants , " Pa said . " Guess your orange trees <br> are different . " <br> Reverend Farley made a brushing motion . " Maybe not exactly at <br> the end of the grove . But close . " <br> " What does it look like ? " I said . <br> The reverend stopped talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , eyes skidding over the freshly blacked cook-stove and <br> the magazine pictures Mama had put up on the walls , over the hard dirt floor <br> and the pie safe with a weeping willow punched into its tin door . He picked up <br> a white enamel pot lid with a blue rim and said , " Hold this close to your <br> eyes . " When I held it up , he said , " Closer , " until the edge of the lid was <br> practically in my eye . " What do you see ? " he said . <br> " The blue is wobbly , and then there 's white over it . That 's all . " <br> " That 's close , " he said . " Except it 's beautiful . " <br> " I like the land , myself , " Mama said . " I like seeing where I stand . <br> Would you care for some pie ? " <br> I kept staring at the lid . What I saw , the blur of blue into white , <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . I probably looked like <br> a pure fool , staring at a pot lid as if it were a magazine picture , but the <br> minister had given me something that I did n't understand . There was nothing <br> of Kansas in that blue line . <br> After Mae 's dried-apple pie , Reverend Farley put down his fork and <br> announced , " Now that was cause for thanksgiving , " the first churchy thing <br> he 'd said since giving the blessing . I put on a pleasant expression , planning <br> to think about oceans while he talked about salvation . Pa looked sour . But <br> Reverend Farley kept unsettling us ; he reached into his shirt pocket and <br> pulled out a harmonica . The first song he played was " Amazing Grace , " <br> which we none of us sang well , and after that he started on a tune I 'd never <br> heard . Sweet and slow , it had a clean ache , and I studied the tablecloth so <br> that no one would be able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice <br> true . <br> Oh , Shenandoah I long to hear you . Look away You rolling river . <br> She sang only when she felt moved ; sometimes years would pass . But when <br> she opened her mouth , we all hushed . Suddenly the air was rich , and so it <br> became poor when she stopped . <br> " That 's no church song , " Pa said while the last note was still <br> hovering . <br> " It can be , " Reverend Farley said . <br> " How ? " Pa said . <br> " It 's about having to go away . It 's not what you want to do , but it 's <br> what you have to do . " <br> I said , " Why does somebody have to go away ? " <br> " Me , I heard a Call , " Reverend Farley said . <br> " What about somebody who 's not a reverend ? " I said . <br> " Nell , " Mama said . <br> " What does a Call sound like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> was n't Mama who would hurt me . She could barely lift her hand to beat <br> biscuits . <br> Reverend Farley said , " Two Episcopalian ministers arrive at the <br> same church , with the congregation there waiting . It 's a big church , folks are <br> well dressed , there are fine carriages outside . The first one says to the <br> people in the church , ' I heard a Call . I do n't know what the other fellow 's <br> doing here . ' <br> " ' I heard a Call , too , ' says the second preacher . <br> " ' What did yours say ? ' <br> " ' Lo , I will make you a leader of nations . ' What did yours <br> say ? ' <br> " ' No one ever lost money on hog futures . ' " <br> " ' Preach on ! ' cried the congregation . " <br> Pa snorted . Myself , I had never seen an Episcopalian . I said , " I <br> do n't think anybody gets called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Reverend Farley said to Pa , " She 's the spit of you , is n't she ? " <br> " Her bad luck , " Pa said . <br> Reverend Farley stayed in town for a week , but we did n't go to hear him <br> preach past the first day , when everyone went . I did n't want to see any more <br> of the man . He had left me feeling rumpled , and even if I was n't fool enough to <br> repeat the experiment with the pot lid , I could n't forget the glimpse he had <br> given me of a view that was light and rested on a color I 'd never seen in <br> nature . <br> After he came I could n't keep a mind to things . Even the chores I <br> normally liked  --  watering the chickens , chopping back the galloping <br> weeds  --  did n't keep my attention , and I made careless mistakes , spilling <br> kerosene and leaving the lamp out overnight , the kind of mistakes my sisters <br> made . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sighed and drifted , <br> thinking shapeless white and blue thoughts , and later when Mama asked <br> where the eggs were , I could n't tell her . I was unsettled , as nervy as a horse <br> when a big storm is coming in . The horizon remained placid , without new <br> wind or the purple blur of thunderheads , but that steadiness was no comfort . <br> Something had slipped into me and burrowed down , and now I scratched and <br> twisted , miserable in my skin . <br> Pa could see my distraction . I was never able to hide anything <br> from the man if he wanted to look , and ever since the dinner with Reverend <br> Farley he kept me close to hand . The Tuesday after the reverend 's visit , he <br> took me out to the barn . Doing chores with him meant I did n't have to make <br> dinner , but it also meant Pa had something he wanted to say , so it was hard <br> to know whether I felt freed or trapped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wanting a piece of meat tonight that 's cooked all the way through ? " I <br> said . <br> " You 're a stubborn thing . " He handed me the flat tin of barn salve <br> that we used on all the cows ' cuts and wounds . The salve had been white <br> once , but it had aged to a thick yellow and smelled like bad cooking fat laced <br> with kerosene . The barn stank whenever we opened the tin , and this summer <br> we had to open it a lot . Both our cows were eaten up by biting flies , their <br> rumps pink with weeping , crusted sores . The cows could hardly stand to be <br> touched , even to be milked , and their lowing was full of long misery . They <br> were normally sweet-tempered animals , but in a minute one of them would <br> try to nip us while we kept dabbing on the sticky ointment . Pa said , " You <br> could make things easy , but you wo n't do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greasy salve stuck to me . The <br> cow twitched her flat rump and huffed irritably . <br> " Girls half your age can manage to make a loaf of bread that <br> does n't come up gummy in the middle . " <br> " It 's a knack . I have n't got it . " " I think we all can see that much . " <br> He reached across the cow 's back to flick a bit of salve from my face . " Girl , <br> what do you want ? " <br> If Pa had looked mean or angry , I would have known what to say , <br> but his face was stony . Mostly , I was aware of the rich , sweet smell of the <br> cows , the tang of manure , and the acrid medicine that was smeared halfway <br> up to my elbows now . " I like to sew . " " I went to town last week . Jack Plat <br> asked after you . His daddy 's spread is bigger than this one . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I knew <br> that . My hands shook a little when I said , " What did you tell him ? " <br> " I told him you were tolerable . " <br> " You do n't help a girl much , do you ? " <br> " I do n't see as that 's my job . " Jack Plat 's daddy 's three hundred <br> acres spilled between us . The Plats had a house with a window , and it <br> occurred to me that it would be a fine thing to look outside of a house during <br> the daylight . Pa said , " What should I have told him , Nell ? That you spent half <br> an evening looking at a pot lid as if it could tell you something ? " <br> " No , do n't tell him that . " <br> " Jack 'll come to see you , if I do n't stop him . " <br> " That 's what people do , I think . They come to see each other . " <br> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want ? " He <br> let me take my time . Jack was a new thought . Marriage was a new thought , <br> though it should n't have been . Just last month , the reverend read out Nussine <br> and Ernold 's banns while Nussine sat like the queen of Sheba in the front <br> row , thinking on babies , Ernold 's wood-frame house , and a new wringer- <br> washer . She was n't but a month older than me . Unbidden images tumbled <br> through my head : Berlinda and Marlon Mallory ran off to Hutchinson to get <br> married , and for months after they came back , Berlinda told about the hotel <br> there , and the wide streets . <br> " No one has called on Mae yet , " I said unsteadily . <br> " There 's no law . " <br> " It would n't be easy here , just her and Viola . " Mae was already <br> seventeen , but little Vi was only nine , and not handy . <br> " We 'll manage . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll tell <br> him . " <br> Mrs. Jack Plat . Jack was shorter than me , with bandy legs and <br> hair so curly that we used to say baa to him in school . He had stopped <br> school at twelve , rather than boarding in Hays for high school , but I saw the <br> Plats at church and in town ; a person had to put his mind to it to disappear in <br> Mercer County . Like everyone , I knew that Jack 's mother was a tyrant , his <br> father a quiet man who stayed out of his wife 's way . Even at church Orris <br> Plat could find a way to stay on the other side of the building from her , a skill <br> we all admired . <br> Jack favored his mother , and I wondered whether that should <br> worry me . His lamblike curls were hers , and his strut , and his quick , cutting <br> words when he was exercised . But he had once spent better than an hour flat <br> on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He must <br> have washed them , because when he brought them home in a basket they <br> were as fluffy as kittens on a greeting card , and he talked his mother into <br> keeping them . I had n't seen any of this , but everybody knew the story . I <br> would learn other stories , different ones , if I lived in the Plat place . <br> " He 's nice enough , " I said . <br> " I wo n't stop you , " Pa said . " I just want you to think . " <br> " What 's to think about ? " <br> " Once you decide , you 've decided . You ca n't come up for air later <br> and say , ' Gaw , that was a mistake . ' So think . Is this what you want out of <br> your future ? " <br> " Future 's a hard thing to see . " I presumed that Pa was thinking <br> about me squinting across the top of the pot lid . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " You better can . " <br> " Did you , when you courted Mama ? " <br> The rough bristles of the cow 's tail whipped me under the <br> ear . " That 'll be a welt , " Pa said . He spread more salve , working the yellow <br> ointment down into the little craters that oozed with their own clear <br> juice . " Your mother is a good woman . I could n't ask for a better one . She <br> knows how to stretch a nickel , and she does n't hanker after what she ca n't <br> have . " <br> He was n't saying anything but the truth . Pa and I were the <br> hankerers . <br> " She 's never raised her voice to me , even when she ought should <br> have , " he said . " When I called on her , folks said she was sweet as a honey <br> cake . " <br> I went back over a sore I 'd already dabbed . Pa was n't much on <br> sweets , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to say is not a complaint , you hear me ? I esteem <br> your mother . I wo n't hold with anything else . " Now that Pa had stopped <br> touching her backside , Dixie was placid , munching the oats he put out for <br> her . " It 's a fine thing to share your days with a person . That 's what a marriage <br> is  --  sharing . You share a home and a place . You share children . But your <br> mother and I do n't see the world alike . When I look over the fields , I see <br> fences that need fixing , the place where the seed washed out . She does n't <br> see those things . " <br> " I know that , " I said . <br> " I 'm trying to tell you something . What do you know about Jack ? " <br> " Same as you . Their place will support another mouth , and his <br> mother 's a pistol . " <br> " Not much . " <br> " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're still a youngster . Wait for a feller who you know you like . " <br> " Guess I 'll be waiting for Reverend Farley to come back . " <br> " Guess you wo n't either . Man who lives riding circuit is n't looking <br> for a wife to support . And his jokes were no good . " <br> " Then I guess I 'd better let Jack Plat come to call . Since I 'm not <br> interested in being a spinster lady . " As if it had been waiting for just this <br> moment , my mind produced a list of Mercer County bachelors : Sam Wynn , <br> whose last wife had died in childbirth at age twenty and who held girls too <br> tight at dances ; Carth Knoller , who lived in town and ran the post office along <br> with the funeral home ; the scattering of ranchers who came in for feed and <br> looked over girls with the same eyes they used for livestock . In that <br> company , Jack looked fine . <br> " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . " <br> This was the first time Pa had indicated I was anything but all a <br> child , and hearing him say so brought feeling up in me  --  something hard , <br> screwed tight . Everyone in Mercer County knew his pride in me , his middle <br> girl , no bigger than a minute but still a firepop . At every funeral or covered <br> supper , people recalled the time a man from the bank came to see Pa . I <br> was n't much out of diapers and did n't know what they were talking about , but <br> I could see Pa sitting at the edge of the bench like a shamed schoolboy . So I <br> crept up behind the man and bit him on the leg . The man yanked away from <br> me and Pa whooped , saying he 'd meant to warn the man about the fice dog . <br> For a long time after that he called me Fice when he was feeling good , <br> though he 'd let that drop away lately . <br> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not after staying on <br> the smallest ranch in Kansas . I 'd like to see something fresh for a change . " <br> He put on a grin I 'd never seen before . It looked bashful , and it <br> made the feeling in me tighten even more , like a jar lid twisted until it breaks . <br> He said , " It 's not enough for you to see your old Pa ? " <br> " That 's the first thing I want to stop seeing , " I said , hating the <br> words the second they flew from my mouth . They were not what I meant to <br> say . There were no words for what I meant to say . <br> Pa 's face slammed shut . He pitched the open tin of cow ointment <br> at me ; its top side stuck itself square against my nose and eyes , and for a <br> panicky second all I could breathe was old , sticky fat and kerosene. "  --  next <br> week , " Pa was saying as I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your <br> mother living with a child who does n't know respect . " <br> " Is there a rag ? " I said . The ointment was all over my face and <br> spattered onto my neck and shoulders . I was struggling not to gag . The <br> dress was done for . <br> He threw a feed sack at me so hard the tie strings whipped my <br> ear . " Mouth on you like an outhouse . No gratitude . " <br> I rubbed the burlap over my face , scraping clots of the ointment <br> that we would need again back into the tin . " I 'm guessing Orris Plat does n't <br> throw cow medicine at anybody . " <br> " I would n't bet against his wife 's throwing arm , though . Looks like <br> you 'll be finding out . You can write a letter and tell us all . " <br> " Are you going to lock me out of the house tonight ? " <br> " I should . But you 'll have a home here as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it . " <br> I stood wiping myself clean until Pa left the barn , the cow making <br> contented grunts . There did n't seem anything wrong with Jack . I was fifteen <br> years old . <br> Continues ...
