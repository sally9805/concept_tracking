<p> EVENTS <p> Earth Aware <p> Earth Day got its start 30 years ago when Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord Nelson returned from inspecting the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and enlisted former Stanford student body president Denis Hayes to launch a national teach-in on the environment . That grassroots effort led to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Air Act in 1970 and other key pieces of legislation designed to protect the precious resources of the earth . Over the past three decades , Earth Day has become a global effort to promote conservation and protection of the environment . Some battles have been won , but the war continues . Communities throughout the Bay Area will mark the 30th anniversary in a variety of ways , all designed to blend good times with a reminder to keep up the good fight .

While working clubs in Los Angeles , Mendes was discovered and signed by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss to record for their A &M; record label . The first Brasil ' 66 release was a huge hit and the group went on tour with Herb Alpert &; the Tijuana Brass . Over the years , Mendes has had to update the name of his group  --  Brasil ' 77 , Brasil ' 88  --  but he 's also updated his sound as he has continued to push boundaries . His 1992 album , " Brasileiro , " mixed hip-hop and Brazilian sounds and won Mendes a Grammy . With the new century , Mendes has renamed his group again and continues to push the envelope of Brazilian music . The concert 's opening act will be Cape Verdean singer Fantcha , a protege of the great barefoot diva Cesaria Evora . <p> . <p> SERGIO MENDES &; BRASIL 2000 , 8 p.m .

Her new album , ' Gung Ho , " finds Smith avoiding current trendiness in favor of good rock ' n ' roll songs with messages about love and spirituality . Smith 's early albums were famous for the cover art by Robert Mapplethorpe , but they were also famous for their music . Smith 's cover of " Gloria " remains a classic . But after the initial Sturm und Drang of the punk movement , Smith all but disappeared for a decade , becoming a housewife and mother in Detroit . Widowed , the poetess of punk returned to music a few years ago with albums such as " Gone Again " and " Peace and Noise . " Those efforts were somewhat flawed , almost as if Smith were trying to figure out where she belonged in a world she 'd abandoned for a decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's found the answer . <p> . <p> PATTI SMITH , 8 p.m. tonight , and tomorrow , the Fillmore , 1805 Geary Blvd. , San Francisco , tickets $26.50 , ( 415 ) 421-8497
