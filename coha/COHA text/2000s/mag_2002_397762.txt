Seven teens , one Queen and an afternoon of straight talk Photograph // For the past year , ESSENCE has conducted the War on Girls series , looking at serious challenges facing our daughters  --  including early puberty , negative images in the media , teen prostitution and the rape crisis in South Africa . But this month we ask girls to tell us their stories and give us an even clearer sense of their world and their struggles . Who better to lead the candid discussion than rapper-actress and former talk-show host Queen Latifah ? Here the Grammy-winning hip-hop artist , who stars in three upcoming films ( Brown Sugar , Chicago and her first self-executive-produced project , Bringing Down the House ) , talks with seven girls between the ages of 14 and 16 , grades 8 through 11 . These young women , whose names and identifying characteristics have been changed to protect their privacy , have varying backgrounds and personalities : Some live in upscale neighborhoods , while others come from working-class environments , Some go to public schools , while others attend small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit insecure ; others are gregarious , straightforward and outgoing . All are bright , beautiful and eager to connect with someone they can confide in and trust . " Our girls need us , " says Latifah . " They face some of the same issues we faced as teens-peer pressure , confusion about sex and trouble communicating with parents . " She continues : " As evidenced by these young sisters , however , there are also very serious issues of low self-esteem , lack of respect for others and the sometimes dangerous desire to fit in . Only two of these girls have fathers at home , and four say they have fractured relationships with their mothers . So who 's going to teach them the truth about their worth ? Our girls need us . And as these young women openly share about boys , sex , peer pressure and their relationships with their parents , the most important thing we can do is listen . " Latifah : I know body image is something that 's very important when you 're a teenager , so let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bodies . Tell me , honestly , do you love your body ? Andrea : I would change a lot of things about myself I want bigger breasts and a bigger butt . I 'm okay with my legs and my feet , butI would change my toes-they 're short and fat . I always wear tennis shoes or closed-toe shoes . I 'd also change my build . I 'd be taller . I 'd be thin . I 'd be different . Photograph // Latifah : What makes you feel you need to be different ? Andrea : I see a lot of girls in the media with beautiful faces and long , straight hair . They have this mad Coke-bottle shape and I 'm like , Oh , I want to look like that . I want to look like Angelina Jolie . Her face is so exotic . And when I see other girls , especially the so-called video hos , they 're so cute . They are n't model-thin ; they 're kind of thick , but they 're still cute . I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Latifah : What makes you think you 're not cute now ? Andrea : I do n't see that when I look in the mirror . Latifah : Okay , you 're her sister , Nikki . Does she love herself for who she is ? Nikki : She never acts like it . Every day she complains about something that she thinks is wrong with her . She gets a lot of compliments at school . I do n't know why she thinks this way . She watches too much TV Latifah : Yeah , cut that TV off Read a book . Do n't buy into what you see out there . We 're all individuals . So you ca n't be like anybody else . You 'll never be Angelina Jolie . Kenya : It 's not all that great being tall either . For as long as I can remember , I 've been tall and skinny . I was always the tallest person in my class , and I was always teased and called a twig . Over the past year I 've started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it . I can laugh about it now ... Latifah : .. but the teasing hurts . Kenya : Yeah . People do n't realize that words influence you . And when they tease you , it does n't just go in one ear and out the other . You store it in your memory . Latifah : How real is the pressure to look a certain way or to be slim ? Jayda : I used to make myself throw up to be slim . Latifah : You were bulimic ? Jayda : I think so . I do n't know . I thought I was fat and that my butt was really huge , so I stopped eating and made myself throw up . Latifah : And nobody ever knew ? Jayda : My friends knew because I never ate around them , so they were like , " Something is wrong with you . " Most of my friends are White and Asian and thin , so I wanted to look like them . Latifah : And you came out of this by yourself ? Jayda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cousin . We 're really close . She made me go to church a lot . Latifah : Did you just stop worrying about how thin you were ? Jayda : I started getting hungry again . Laughs Latifah : I 'm glad you made it through that . Janae : My friend used to starve herself and throw up . I went to see her in the hospital maybe three or four months ago . But she 's eating now . Her dad was forcing her to be in gymnastics , and she had to be a certain weight . I 'm in the same kind of situation . My dad wants me to lose ten to 15 pounds so I can run track , and I 'm like , " What ? " Latifah : How does that make you feel ? Janae : For a long time I was n't happy with myself . People would give me compliments and I 'd think , Okay , I 'm cool . Then I would go visit my dad and he would say , " You should lose 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I just got over all that . I wish I could look however I want to look and be like , whatever . Latifah : Why ca n't you ? Janae : When I first went to high school , I hung out with people who were popular . So ever since then it was like , " Okay , you have to look like this , dress like that and do this and do that . " Maybe I just fell in with the wrong crowd of people . Latifah : So do you feel trapped by the in crowd now-like you ca n't do what you want to ? Janae : I can do what I want to do , CONTINUED ON PAGE 176 but I ca n't ... Latifah : ... you ca n't keep your status within the crowd if you do that . Janae : Right . Latifah : Is the status worth it ? Janae : I 've been breaking away lately , a little bit at a time . Getting involved with this little clique was a mistake . Latifah : What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out with just a group of friends . Now our clique has about 20 girls in it . I got into it because the girl who 's the head of the group is my play sister . One of the girls in our crew recently got into a fight because someone was dissin ' our clique , and I was like , This is too much . I do n't really know this girl . We do n't go anywhere together . I do n't even have her phone number . But I 'm expected to fight for her and get in trouble and get arrested and all that stuff ? I told them no , so they 're mad at me as of today . Latifah : How important are your friends to you ? Janae : Hmmm , I think I just need to hang out with boys because girls are something else . Latifah : Why do girls have such a tough time getting along with one other ? Kenya : When I hang out with girls , there 's always drama . I go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two-faced . One minute we 're friends , and the next minute they hate my guts . Karen : I just do n't get along with girls . They always have something negative to say about me or about the way I dress . They 'll say , " You 're too hoochie . Do n't wear that . " I deal with it by hanging out with boys . They 're like big brothers to me . The girls think I 'm hanging around a lot of boys because I 'm a ho , and that 's just not true . Andrea : Girls trip over little stuff . It 'll be something really stupid , like your eye color or they 'll hate on you because you 're light-skinned . I get that so much . Latifah : So who do you turn to when girls hate on you ? Some of you hang with guys . What about your parents ? How many of you come from two-parent households ? Two raise their hands . Andrea : I have a father , but he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because my mom was an alcoholic . They took me away from her when I was a baby . It 's a big secret . It sucks . I want to get to know my mother if she 's alive . Latifah : We did a lot of reunions on my talk show , although in some cases it 's not the best thing . But you do n't have to be totally powerless . You can go on-line and find out your rights . What about the rest of you ? What 's your relationship like with your parents ? Can you talk to them about most things ? Do your parents discuss sex with you , for example ? Janae : My dad talked to me . He 's blunt , so he was like , " You 're going to high school and you 're cute and everything , so boys are going to try to get in your pants . " I was like , ugh . I do n't talk to my mom so much . She does n't trust me . Latifah : Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't believe me , so I 've given up trying to convince her . Because , you know , they give you condoms at school ? Well , she found condoms in my room and she screamed , " What are you doing with these ? ! " I 'm like , Oh , God . Tammy : I car ; t really talk to my mother because she 's not an affectionate woman . She was abused as a child , so she 's got all these walls and she ca n't trust people . I 've tried to talk to her boyfriend , but he just says , " Do n't have sex , keep your legs closed . " I really ca n't talk to them . Latifah : So who do you talk to ? Tammy : I talk to my friends , but I want an adult point of view . Latifah : You need an adult point of view . Tammy : And I do n't have it . Latifah : You do n't have a teacher who you 're cool with ? Tammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't feel comfortable talking to my teacher about . Latifah : Like ? Tammy : Like sex . Karen : I ca n't talk to my mother about sex . I mean what 's she going to think about me ? I want to ask her stuff , but I 'm scared because I do n't know what she 's going to say . Latifah : So who do you talk to about your body and the changes it 's going through ? And CONTINUED ON PAGE 237 what do you know about your body and how it works ? Tammy : We have menstrual cycles . Latifah : Do you know why you have menstrual cycles ? Tammy : Something about getting pregnant . Andrea : To get rid of all the toxic stuff . Janae : My dad tried to explain it to me and I was like , " No , skip that . " Tammy : I 've never had anybody explain it to me . Latifah : What about STDs ? Do n't they teach you about these things in health classes ? Janae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Okay , watch this video . " Jayda : My cousin has AIDS , so she tells me if I do have sex , make sure I 'm safe . It 's scary though . Latifah : Do you know about how you can contract STDs ? Jayda : Yeah , I saw a show about it on MTV . Latifah : How many of you are sexually active ? Andrea raises her hand . Latifah : I 'm hearing that a lot of girls are performing oral sex , or receiving oral sex or anal sex to say they 're maintaining their virginity . Do you know anybody like that ? Janae : There 's this girl in my school who is n't very popular or that attractive . I tried to talk to her , help her out and be her friend , but she took a pass and went on the third floor of the building and gave a senior a blow job . When she told me , I was like , " Oh , my God . " Latifah : What 's the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have girlfriends who have had sex , and they say I 'm missing out . I 'm just like , " I 'll wait . " If you ask some guys what they think of a girl who has sex , they 'll say , " She 's a ho . I would n't really get involved with a girl who 's like that . " Janae : They want you to give in , but if you give in , you 're not the kind of girl they want to marry . That makes no sense . Nikki : Guys brag about it , too . At my school while one class was watching a movie , a girl let this guy finger-bang her . He was bragging about it . Idiot . Tammy : I have a friend who ditched school to give head to a guy in the park . I tried to talk to her . But she has done so much stuff . I 'm like , " Girl , you do n't have to do that . " I have to be a mother figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have parents who are too controlling and do n't let them do anything or too loose and let them do everything . I could n't watch out for her , so she just went buck wild . Latifah : When I was younger , one of my friends was sexually active during freshman year . She used to tell us everything in detail . I was fascinated . I 'm like , " Well , when it 's my turn I hope it goes down like that . " But when it happened , it was n't like that . There was a lot of pressure . A lot of begging- " Please , please , please , I 'll just put a little bit in . " I was like " No , no , no " until I got to the point that I just got sick , of saying no and finally went on and said " Go " head . " That 's not the way to have sex or lose your virginity . It took a while for me to realize there were people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were virgins . I mean half of those people who talked about having sex were lying . They really were n't sexually active , but they thought it was the cool thing to do , so they said they were doing it too . And it kind of pissed me off because I went and did it . And you know what ? I wish I had saved it . I wish I would have waited longer , until I could really mentally handle it , and it could have gone down the way I would have wanted it to go down , not just the way he wanted it to go down . Andrea , what was your first experience like ? Andrea : Me ? See , I do n't want you guys to think I 'm a bad person . Latifah : We 're all sharing here , and we 're not making judgments . Andrea : Well , I lost my virginity at a party . I had just turned 15 . I was out with my friends and we were having a good time getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then this guy walks up to me , like , " Oh , you 're beautiful . I love you . " And I 'm like , " What ? You do n't even know me . " The party is so crowded and the music is loud . There 's flashing lights and smoke and I could n't see . I 'm looking for my friends thinking , Where il they go ? Why did they leave me alone ? Are n't they supposed to be watching out for me ? The guy keeps offering me beer , and you know I 'm wasted , so I do n't know what I 'm doing . While I 'm dancing with him , he starts pushing me down on the floor . Nobody even notices . I ca n't fight back because he 's huge , and I 'm like , " What are you doing ? Stop , stop ! " I 'm saying , " No , no , this is a bad idea ! " But he did n't stop . And I had on this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Is n't that rape ? Latifah : That 's definitely rape ! Tammy : Did you know him ? Andrea : No . Tammy : Did he use protection ? Andrea : I have no idea . Latifah : You started by saying , " I do n't want you to think I 'm a really bad person , " but you were raped . Andrea : No , because why am I getting drunk at 15 ? Latifah : Why are you getting raped at 15 ? It 's not your fault . No matter what , no means no . No means no ! If I say no , that does n't mean push yourself on me harder . That means , " No , I do n't want this . " You did n't deserve that , I do n't care how drunk you were , how short your skirt was , even if you did n't have panties on , it 's your business . This is your body , and nobody is supposed to be able to put their hands on you without it being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even remember it all . If I saw him today , I would n't remember him . I passed out . When I woke up , my friends were just beating this guy 's ass . I 'm like , " What happened ? " I went to the doctor a week later . I was n't bleeding or anything internally . Everything 's fine . I do n't have any diseases . Latifah : Did you go back to the doctor six months after that appointment ? Andrea : No . Latifah : You should go back just to get a clean bill of health . How do you feel about guys and sex now ? I know you do n't remember much about that night , but I 'm sure you 've been in situations where guys have tried to get you to that point . Andrea : I 'll find an excuse like , " Oh , I got ta get home . " Latifah : Do you ever feel like you might hurt his feelings by just saying no ? Andrea : Guys wo n't accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? What about my feelings ? You 're being selfish . " Latifah : That 's right , always be selfish . Listen , let me tell you all something : Guys will never get tired of chasing girls , so do n't worry about it . If a guy decides he ca n't wait for you , there are other fish in the sea . And he knows it , believe me . Do n't let anybody pressure you into having sex . You have that power . And real men want a girl who 's going to be in control of herself . So if you 're ever in a situation where you do n't feel comfortable , then it 's not comfortable-period , end of story . And do n't make apologies for how you feel or what you 've done . Andrea , for example , said , " I do n't want you to think bad of me . " Forget what people think . Start saying , " What do I think ? What do I feel ? " Your teenage years are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you like and dislike , what you want and do n't want . Life is about choices . Everything is always going to come down to your choices and decisions . You have to look inside yourself and trust you more than you trust anyone . Go with what your gut is telling you . All your life-whether it 's a job you 're going for , whether it 's college-you 've got ta make the final decisions about what 's best for you . But I hope you have God in your life to help guide you , too . As young women , you should also know everything there is to know about your body . I want y'all to go get a book when you leave here and learn about your bodies . Sit in front of a mirror , open your legs and look at your vagina . Get to know it . You need to know if something does n't look right down there , so if there 's a problem , you know to go to the doctor . Take control of your bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be who you wan na be . And I want y'all to call me and let me know how things are going . Nikki : Like we 'll really reach you . Latifah : Of course you 'll reach me , I 've got two cell phones and an E-mail address . Just promise not to pass my number around . Girls and Latifah laugh together . Sidebar " I want to change a lot of things about myself . I 'd be taller . I 'd be thin . I 'd be different .
