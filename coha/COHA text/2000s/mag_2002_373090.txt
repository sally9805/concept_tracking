Bossidy , the veteran chairman of Honeywell , was struck that among the shelves of business books published each year on strategy and leadership , none focused on the subject that obsesses successful executives : the essential grunt work of delivering results . So with consultant Ram Charan , Bossidy wrote Execution : The Discipline of Getting Things Done ( Crown Business ) . Bossidy discussed the book with TIME 's Andrea Sachs : <P> Q : How important was execution to your career ? <P> A : I 'm an impatient person , and I get more satisfaction from seeing things get done than I do about philosophizing or building sand castles . Many people regard execution as detail work that 's beneath the dignity of a business leader . That 's wrong . It 's a leader 's most important job . <P> Q : Who stand out as your execution heroes ? <P> A : Jack Welch had an enormously successful career at GE , built basically on execution . We mention Dick Brown of EDS . The Colgate-Palmolive people have done a wonderful job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Ralph Larsen has had a long history of being able to execute . <P> Q : You also name failures at execution . Is it hard to single out business associates ? <P> A : I did n't try to be critical of the men . I did use three examples . Rick Thoman of Xerox is one . Richard McGinn of Lucent is another . And Mike Armstrong of AT &T.; I pointed out in all three cases that I did n't think the way they were operating the company was consistent with being able to execute . These are decent men , and I like them . I hope when all is said and done , they take it for the teaching value of it , rather than as a personal criticism .
