Michelle Harris sat at the stoplight on Old Hickory and Highway 100 , grinding her teeth . She was late . Corinne hated when she was late . She would n't bitch at her , would n't chastise her , would just glance at the clock on the stove , the digital readout that always , always ran three minutes ahead of time so Corinne could have a cushion , and a little line would appear between her perfectly groomed eyebrows . <p> Their match was in an hour . They had plenty of time , but Corinne would need to drop Hayden at the nursery and have a protein smoothie before stretching in preparation for their game . Michelle and Corinne had been partners in tennis doubles for ages , and they were two matches from taking it all . Their yearly run at the Richland club championship was almost a foregone conclusion ; they 'd won seven years in a row . <p> Tapping the fingers of her right hand on the wheel , she used her left to pull her ponytail around the curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood . Corinne had n't needed any comfort . She was always the strong one . Even as a young child , when Michelle pulled that ponytail around her neck , the unruly curls winding around her ear , Corinne would get that little line between her brows to show her displeasure at her elder sister 's weakness . <p> Remembering , Michelle flipped the hair back over her shoulder with disgust . The light turned green and she gunned it , foot hard on the pedal . She hated being late for Corinne . <p> Michelle took the turn off Jocelyn Hollow Road and followed the sedate , meandering asphalt into her sister 's cul-de-sac . The dogwood tree in the Wolffs ' front yard was just beginning to bud . Michelle smiled . Spring was coming . Nashville had been in the grip of a difficult winter for months , but at last the frigid clutch showed signs of breaking . New life stirred at the edges of the forests , calves were dropping in the fields . The chirping of the wrens and cardinals had taken on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their young . Corinne herself was ripe with a new life , seven months into an easy pregnancy  --  barely looking four months along . Her activity level kept the usual baby weight off , and she was determined to play tennis up to the birth , just like she 'd done with Hayden . <p> Not fair . Michelle did n't have any children , did n't have a husband for that matter . She just had n't met the right guy . The consolation was Hayden . With a niece as adorable and precocious as hers , she did n't need her own child . Not just yet . <p> She pulled into the Wolffs ' maple-lined driveway and cut the engine on her Volvo . Corinne 's black BMW 535i sat in front of the garage door . The wrought iron lantern lights that flanked the front doors were on . Michelle frowned . It was n't like Corinne to forget to turn those lights off . She remembered the argument Corinne and Todd , her husband , had gotten into about them . Todd wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning automatically . Corinne insisted they could turn the switch themselves with no problem . They 'd gone back and forth , Todd arguing for the security , Corinne insisting that the look of the dusk-to-dawns were cheesy and would n't fit their home . She 'd won , in the end . She always did . <p> Corinne always turned off the lights first thing in the morning . Like clockwork . <p> The hair rose on the back of Michelle 's neck . This was n't right . <p> She stepped out of the Volvo , did n't shut the door all the way behind her . The path to her sister 's front door was a brick loggia pattern , the nooks and crannies filled with sand to anchor the Chilhowies . Ridiculously expensive designer brick from a tiny centuries-old sandpit in Virginia , if Michelle remembered correctly . She followed the path and came to the front porch . The door was unlocked , but that was typical . Michelle told Corinne time and again to keep that door locked at night . But Corinne always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased the door open . <p> Oh , my God . <p> Michelle ran back to her car and retrieved her cell phone . As she dialed 911 , she rushed back to the porch and burst through the front door . <p> The phone was ringing in her ear now , ringing , ringing . She registered the footprints , did a quick lap around the bottom floor and seeing no one , took the steps two at a time . She was breathing hard when she hit the top , took a left and went down the hall . <p> A voice rang in her ear , and she tried to comprehend the simple language as she took in the scene before her . <p> " 911 , what is your emergency ? " <p> She could n't answer . Oh God , Corinne . On the floor , face down . Blood , everywhere . <p> " 911 , what is your emergency ? " <p> The tears came freely . The words left her mouth before she realized they 'd been spoken aloud . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Can you repeat that , ma'am ? " <p> Could she ? Could she actually bring her larynx to life without throwing up on her dead sister 's body ? She touched her fingers to Corinne 's neck . Remarkable how chilled the dead flesh felt . Oh , God , the poor baby . She ran out of the room , frenzied . Hayden , where was Hayden ? Michelle turned in a tight circle , seeing more footprints . No sign of the little girl . She was yelling again , heard the words fly from her mouth as if they came from another 's tongue . <p> " There 's blood , oh , my God , there 's blood everywhere . And there are footprints Hayden ? " Michelle was screaming , frantic . She tore back into the bedroom . Something in her mind snapped , she could n't seem to get it together . <p> The 911 operator was yelling in her ear , but she did n't respond , could n't respond . " Ma'am ? Ma'am ? Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A strawberry-blond head appeared from around the edge of the king-sized sleigh bed . It took a moment to register  --  <p> Hayden , with red hair ? She was a towhead , so blond it was almost white , no , that was n't right . <p> " Hayden , oh , dear sweet Jesus , you 're covered in blood . Come here . How did you get out of your crib ? " She gathered the little girl in her arms . Hayden was frozen , immobile , unable or unwilling to move for the longest moment , then she wrapped her arms around her aunt 's shoulders with an empty embrace of inevitability . Pieces of the toddler 's hair , stiff and hard with blood , poked into her neck . Michelle felt a piece of her core shift . <p> " Ma'am ? Ma'am , what is your location ? " <p> The operator 's voice forced her to look away from Corinne 's broken form . She raised herself , holding tight to Hayden . Get her out of here . She ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm here . It 's 4589 Jocelyn Hollow Court . My sister " They were on the stairs now , moving down , and Michelle could see the whispers of blood trailing up and down the carpet . <p> The operator was still trying to sort through the details . " Hayden is your sister ? " <p> " Hayden is her daughter . Oh , God . " <p> As Michelle reached the bottom of the stairs , the child shifted on her shoulder , reaching a hand behind her , looking up toward the second floor . <p> " Mama hurt , " she said in a voice that made her sound like a broken-down forty-year-old , not a coy , eighteen-month-old sprite . Mama hurt . She does n't anymore , darlin ' . <p> They were out the front door and on the porch now , Michelle drawing in huge gulps of air , Hayden crying silently into her shoulder , a hand still pointing back toward the house . <p> " Who is dead , ma'am ? " the operator asked , more kindly now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinne . She 's she 's cold . " <p> Michelle could n't hold it in anymore . She heard the operator say they were sending the police . She walked down those damnable bricks and set Hayden in the front seat of the Volvo . <p> Then she turned and lost her battle with the nausea , vomiting out her very soul at the base of the delicate budding dogwood . <p> Amorning off . <p> Instead of lounging in bed , luxuriating in the crisp sheets and getting irritated with the Tennessean , Metro Nashville homicide lieutenant Taylor Jackson was squinting at the ceiling in her living room , a small flutter of panic moving through her chest . <p> " Baldwin ? " she called , stepping closer to the fireplace . " Baldwin ! " <p> " What ? " A voice floated down the stairs , tinged with impatience . <p> " You need to see this . I think the ceiling is wet . " <p> The clatter of footsteps on the stairs assured Taylor that her fiancT was making the trek from their bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room directly below , posthaste . He appeared at her side , joined her in craning his head toward the living room ceiling . A dark gray stain was moving across the joint , treading a thin line of damp . As they stared , a small drop of water beaded up from the end of the discoloration . Neither of them moved as it grew , larger and larger , then broke off and fell with a muffled plop onto Baldwin 's shoulder . <p> They sprang into action , no words needed . Baldwin sprinted back upstairs toward the bathroom to turn off the water . Taylor went to the kitchen and came back with a spaghetti pot . She stood under the dribble , catching droplets of water as they rushed through the surface of the drywall and fell to earth . <p> God , what next ? <p> Baldwin came back to the living room with a step-ladder . " This house is built on an Indian burial ground , Taylor . I swear it . I turned the water off . We can set the pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He positioned the ladder under the leak and took the container from Taylor , setting it on the top . A happy plink rewarded his efforts . <p> They shared an exasperated laugh . In the month they 'd been home from their pseudo-honeymoon , everything that could go wrong with their relatively new house had . A fitting metaphor for their life . No matter what they planned , how they tried , they could n't seem to get onto the right page and make it official . Taylor was content to remain unmarried . Baldwin was starting to come around to her way of thinking . <p> " Who do you want me to call ? The home warranty place ? " He started for the kitchen . <p> " Yeah . The number is in the folder in the server . They 're going to have to send out a plumber now , we ca n't wait . " <p> He opened the drawer and pulled out an overstuffed file folder . " Okay , I 'll make the call . But I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Taylor gave the ceiling a last hard stare , then joined Baldwin . <p> " Here , give me that . I 'll call . You go on and finish packing . Besides , the plane leaves when you tell it to . Director . " <p> He shot her a look . " I 'm not the Director . I 'm the Acting Director while Garrett has this stupid surgery . That just means I get to push his pencils around his desk and pretend to look important for two weeks . Seriously , I 'd rather stay here , fight with the plumber . " <p> Garrett Woods , director of the FBI 's Behavioral Science Unit and Baldwin 's boss , had called the previous evening . He 'd gone for his routine yearly physical and ended up hospitalized , scheduled for a triple bypass . He needed someone he trusted to hold down the fort . Baldwin was the obvious choice . Taylor hoped it was n't a play to get him to come back and run the BSU permanently . There 'd been quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should have been their honeymoon . The man who 'd been leading the BSU , Stuart Evans , had been summarily fired after aper-sonnel issue made headlines . The Bureau was n't a big fan of having their personal laundry aired in the media . Garrett Woods took the position again , leaving his number three in the bureau spot . He had n't been happy working at that level anyway , was thrilled to return to the BSU and make things right with his investigative divisions and behavioral analysis unit profilers . <p> " You need to go tend to Garrett 's cases . And make sure he listens to the doctors . I ca n't believe he 's so sick . " <p> " Me neither . He seems so indestructible to me , always has . So you think you can handle this ? " <p> She kissed him , then pulled back and raised an eyebrow . " Uh , yeah . It 's just a little leak . " <p> " Okay , then . I 'm going to finish packing . " With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled after him . God , what a goof she 'd become . Fools in love <p> And their love nest was falling in around their ears . This would be the fourth time she 'd had to call for service since they 'd moved in two months ago . There had been contractors crawling all over the place for silly little issues  --  a broken fan blade on the heater , a squirrel who 'd nested in the crawlspace and chewed through some electrical wiring , a faulty thermostat on the freezer . Now a leak in the master bath . They were making their bones with the warranty company . She got the plumber 's name and number , left them a message , then went upstairs , determined to make Acting Director Dr. John Baldwin regret that he was leaving for two weeks and prove her point . The Gulf-stream could n't exactly leave without him . <p> The phone rang as she hit the second stair . What now ? She backtracked , went to the kitchen and saw the number on the caller ID . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sergeant Peter Fitzgerald , her second in command , greeted her brusquely . " I know it 's your day off , but you need to come in . We 've got a murder that 's going to have fleas . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Some sweet little mother out in Hillwood . I 'm hearing words like Laci and Peterson " <br> Continues ...
