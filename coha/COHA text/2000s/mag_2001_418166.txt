2 CRITICAL CONCEPTS ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT MYLES SAYS . STAY CENTERED " If you put at your weight on one pedal and bar , you 'll get a really bad wiggle when you hit the bump . It 'll turn you  --  or ruin your balance and wreck you . Most beginners make this mistake . Stay centered from side to side . When you get advanced you can weight one side to initiate a turn on more technical terrain  --  but that 's a real high level . " STAY BACK " It 's a mistake you 'll make long after you think you have this move mastered It seems like you have to wait and wait to return your normal riding position . You get impatient -I did a huge endo and separated my shoulder in ' 92 because I did n't stay back . and the bike did a big arc forward and pitched me over the bar . " HERE 'S WHAT MOUNTAIN DEW COMMERCIALS WO N'T TEACH YOU : Getting monster air is often slowerthan staying close to the ground and absorbing bumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , Air is undeniably impressive-but just like in skiing , the closer you stay to the ground , the faster you go . This is n't always true-it 's usually faster to leap over insane technical sections or elements such as double or triple jumps , But for trails with isolated , moderate bumps , water bars or similar conditions , you lose momentum when you lose contact with Ma Earth . Knowing how to suck up bumps is also a plus for obstacles followed quickly by turns  --  because your wheels have traction , you can set up better for a change in direction . Team Giant pro and 2000 world downhill champ Myles Rockwell is known for his skyscraping leaps . He 's just as good at staying low and fast-it 's just that nobody notices except the timing clock . HERE ARE HIS SECRETS : " It'ss a simple idea , " he explains . " Jumping is the weighting and loading of suspension and pedals-so to not jump you need to unweight body and bike , creating no energy from the face of the jump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just the difference between 2 inches versus 3 feet . The goal is to stay as low as possible . Still worried your pseudo-gnarly friends will tease you for staying low while they sky ? Pass along this wisdom from Rockwell : " Not catching air is an advanced technique . Believe it or not , absorbing bumps can be hairier than jumping over them . When you try to absorb stuff going fast-and I 've had this happen to me-you sometimes get kicked over the bars . You just kind of bottom out on the bike and get bucked . Everyone has different limitations for how big of a bump they can absorb . The deciding factor is strength-strong riders seem to be able to absorb bigger bumps. " 1 I 'M APPROACH IN NEUTRAL POSITION " To not jump , you need to keep your body neutral as you hit the obstacle , then absorb the bike 's buck with your body , instead of letting it launch you up . Keep your elbows and knees loose , yet near full extension-that 's so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bump . Hover over the saddle-do n't stand upright , but do n't plant your butt , either . " 2 MOVE BACK " Right before you make contact , move your butt toward the rear wheel . Your arms should be at full ex tension-but still not locked . If you do n't make this small , quick weight shift , when the rear wheel hits later , it 'll buck you over the bar because you 're too far forward and the bike is unbalanced . " 3 ABSORB THE HIT " This is the quickest , toughest , easiest-to-screw-up move of the whole technique . Almost let go of the bike in that instant you hit the bump-you want the feeling of the bump and the bike just coming up to you . Let the bars rise . Let the pedals rise . Allow the saddle to come through your legs and up to your chest . Keep your butt over the rear wheel . Let the bike come up further and further-exaggerate the motions of soaking up a bump . The whole bike should shoot up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a big shock . You 're absorbing the force . If you pushed into it , you 'd be pre-loading for a jump . " 4 GET BACK DOWN " Push down on the bar on the backside-it makes a softer landing , and gets your wheels back down sooner . As you get at this , drae the bar back toward your hips and extend your legs to get the rear wheel down even sooner . Remember . THe sooner you get your wheels back down , the faster you 'll go overall . But do n't rush to get back to your neutral riding position  --  stay back , because if the rear wheel really kicks up , you need to push it back with your butt . " Sidebar <p>
