The sensuous flowers of Mary Joan Waid 's pastels reflect her exploration of both artistic and philosophical concerns . <p> New York City artist Mary Joan Waid is unabashed in her love of color . " It 's so glorious , how could anyone ignore it ? " she exclaims . She feels as strongly about flowers , viewing their beauty and complexity as ample subject matter for nearly all of her oil and pastel paintings . In Waid 's portrayals , however , the buds and blooms reveal far more than loveliness . Their imagery is both an exploration of her concerns  --  whether personal or artistic  --  and a celebration of a flower 's highly sensuous qualities . <p> The artist 's still lifes have evolved from close-focus renditions in the 1970s to the airy and serene compositions of her current work . Waid , who was born and raised in Kansas , focuses much of her attention on where the items in her setups are placed  --  where they begin and end and where they come together . " Growing up in Kansas , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Seeing the way the sky and ground stretch out and come together became a part of me , and it affects my life and my work even today . " The items come from the SoHo loft she 's called home for almost three decades , anything that " grabs my attention , " she says simply . She works equally in oil and pastel , concentrating on one medium for several months before turning to the other . <p> When she begins a new painting , Waid usually has a concept for a composition already in mind , often concerning her twin interests of space and light . One common theme is an opening , such as a window , within a given space , " which creates one level that opens up onto another , " she says . At other times , the composition is about light , whether it is in front of the objects or behind them . " Light reveals the composition as it washes over the front of the subject or is reflected behind it , " she says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At times I 'm making the image very frontal ; other times , very multidimensional . All these issues influence the work , depending on what I 'm dealing with at the moment . " Of equal importance is the movement of her subject across the picture plane . " The strength of the composition is in how I set up these elements , " she notes . <p> For a pastel , Waid first lightly blocks in the design , focusing on the pattern of lights and darks . " I just want to place everything within the rectangle at this point , " she says . Working on a sheet of Arches Cover , she builds directly on top of the pastel drawing , working broadly at first  --  using the heel of her hand to rub in the pigments  --  and in more detail with lighter strokes as she progresses . She attends to only one area at a time using Sennelier and a few Diane Townsend pastels . " I block in the area in a general way , then the area behind it , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page , establishing the relationships . " To remove color , the artist uses a chamois , which also disturbs the fibers of the paper and allows the pigments to build into its surface . In her earlier pastels she covered the entire sheet , but recently she 's been experimenting with colored grounds that serve as a middle value , allowing her to leave more of the ground exposed . When she finishes , she applies fixative but is seldom satisfied with its effect . " It changes the quality of the work , " she reports , " but so far I have n't found an alternative . " <p> This straightforward technique is of Waid 's own design . She did not study pastel at Wichita University , now Wichita State University , in Kansas , while she earned her B.F.A . degree , but learned it by experimentation years later . Examining the drawings of Degas and other masters of the medium , she organized her practice sessions around achieving a sense of a flower 's transparency , the quality about the subject that most appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the paintings of others until her own method emerged . " To make your work unique , you have to develop a technique that suits your particular needs , " she advises . <p> Color is a crucial element in Waid 's paintings , and all the richness and contrast within even a single flower affords a wide range to explore . The artist believes that despite the ease of seeing flowers as outlines , looking carefully reveals myriad colors and intricate details that culminate in a powerful sensory experience , particularly when set against areas of lower value . " I love to contrast a rich area against a dull , flat area , especially in the way color glows as it bounces around inside of a bloom , " Waid says . " The translucence of flowers builds reflections , and it seems like the light is shining out of the flower rather than on it . When the light is low and the contrast is dim , you can still see the color changes . It 's very subtle , but if you really look , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In these low-contrast images , Waid is often intrigued by a color she thinks of as " no-color . " These areas are so close in value to the ones around them that it 's difficult to make out any differences . For instance , in Floating Pink ( not shown ) , the artist only slightly indicated the glass bowl within the dark brown that surrounds the peony . Likewise , in Spring Rain , Waid tested how close she could make the values and still hold the work together . " I return to this issue frequently , " the artist says . " Making a color that is no specific color but still creates defined areas of change is a compelling problem . " <p> Besides addressing such artistic issues , Waid 's still lifes sometimes confront the artist 's personal concerns , although " whatever motivates me to do the work does n't need to be part of the viewer 's experience , " she says . The New Leaf , for example , is part of a series in which the artist questioned to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The mirror represents illusion , and the artist 's reflection in it places her simultaneously inside and outside of the still life , as does the reflection of the begonia . At the same time , the viewer can see the mirror nestled in the plant , making the painting both a self-portrait and a still life . " I did n't lay out the question when I began the painting , but I could see after I completed it that I was exploring how much of the outside world I absorb , " she explains . Despite the personal nature of the content , viewers can find meaning in it by relating the imagery to themselves . " The universality of the question depends on how well I gave viewers visual access to the ideas , " Waid remarks . <p> All of the artist 's still lifes are autobiographical . " Each one relates to issues I 'm dealing with , " she says , " which gives the work a sense of direction and a connection to the universal . Other people can relate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy  --  my ideas and emotions  --  I can convey more information about the importance of the objects . " As an example , she cites the technical mastery of certain Dutch still lifes , and their relative flatness compared to others that are more evocative . " Making a still life is more than just recording a setup , " the artist points out . <p> In her latest work , Waid further explores the idea of where things come together , focusing on hands outstretched , grasping fruit , or holding flowers . Although she is still interested in space , light , and how the subject moves across the picture plane , she is discovering new forms for these elements . " I do n't know where this newest work is going , " she admits , adding , " and that 's a wonderful feeling . " <p> Waid 's pastels strike viewers at a personal level because the artist offers something of herself in each image . There 's no denying the artist 's hand and mind are at work , and what they conjure up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an experience . <p> The artist is represented by Nohra Haime Gallery in New York City . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Left : The New Leaf , 1985 , pastel , 22 1/2 x 30 .
