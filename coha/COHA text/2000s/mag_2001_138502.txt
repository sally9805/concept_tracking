HE WAS a bully . He was an ass . He was an arrogant American set loose upon the world , doing that arrogant American thing . Strutting . Finger-pointing . Talking trash . During the gold medal game he shouted at a French opponent , " Why do n't you go back home ? " He followed one fourth-quarter dunk by blowing a kiss to the crowd , then doubled his pleasure with two kisses after the next . He was great , He was insufferable . Soon he would have that Olympic gold medal . Soon he would be a symbol for everything at the 2000 Sydney Games that felt ugly and wrong . // His friends stared . His mother squirmed . His high school coach , his college teammates , his teammates on the Toronto Raptors , his ever-growing legion of fans  --  all were taken by surprise . Throughout the preliminary games and the entire Olympic tournament he carried himself like a different man : smile gone , anger boiling over . Twice he engaged in shoving matches ; in a tune-up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Gaze ; once he tried to pick a fight with three Russian opponents as the first half ended . He literally leaped over a 7 ' 2 " Frenchman named Frdric Weis for one of the most mind-bending dunks in basketball history , then stood and yelled and gestured to the crowd  --  " as if to say , " one scribe wrote , " Drink in the wonder of me. " // No one had ever seen him act this way . For two years he had been the NBA 's great nice hope , its antidote to the thug-lifes who had stripped the game of its lofty TV ratings and its buzz . He always talked about team . He called Mom after every game . But now , in Sydney , he had replaced his cute shaved scalp with a lopsided mini-Afro . After Team USA scraped by Lithuania , he walked off the court holding up his finger in a ridiculous No. 1 gesture . The Aussie fans jeered . They chanted his name and called him a wanker . // Later , he could explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondered what had gotten into him . His career had seemed so perfect , his image so pristine , that few could imagine any reason for him to change so jarringly . But few knew that the furies of modern sports celebrity had , in the previous months , set upon him en masse . Family , agent , endorsements , game : Each spoke in the wheel of his life had snapped , one right after the other , and he found himself besieged no matter which way he turned . He felt betrayed . He felt like a sucker . " Vince did n't want to be Vince Carter , " his mother , Michelle , says . " He wanted to be somebody , anybody else . " // The Olympics granted that wish , allowing him to get away , far from the brother who could n't stop messing up , far from the cousin who 'd let him down . No , the world did n't like what he became in Australia , but in the rush to rip Carter no one seemed to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different person there . He was a different player . At first an afterthought , named to the squad because of an injury to another player , he led the U.S. in scoring and emerged as its dominant force . Freed for the first time from the bonds of decorum , Carter played better than ever . // Now , though , it was ending . Now , in the seconds after the U.S. won the gold medal , a feeling rushed through him like a fresh wind . All the pride and months of frustration and fear came bubbling out , and he began to weep . As he hugged his mother in the stands and the tears streamed down his face , that need to punish anyone who stood in his way left him too . He could feel himself coming back to himself . // Soon , the people around him and the instincts he had developed long ago would impel Carter to cut his hair . Soon he would be nice again , insist he was the old Vince again , and everyone would agree this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question only twice . Once to his dad , once to his mom , a seven-year-old trying to understand why his parents must split up . Vince Sr. and Michelle hemmed and hawed , reciting vague words that revealed nothing , and he never asked again . Learn to live with it , Michelle would say when a problem arose , so he did . He learned to live without his dad , learned to live with Michelle 's new husband , her fellow teacher Harry Robinson . " I do n't know how I handled it , " Carter says . " I just let it go . " He did his best to keep everything calm . He called the new man Dad . Vince Jr . was the sweetest boy , everyone said . If there was any sign of conflict , he always slid out of the line of fire . // " Vince goes all out to avoid confrontation , " Robinson says . " Sometimes we would say , ' Vince , you 've got to stand your ground , ' but he 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the punches , and he hopes things will smooth out on their own . " // He and his father had been close once . The day the newborn Vince came home from the hospital , Vince Sr. and his brother Oliver Lee , who would soon embark on a solid collegiate basketball career at Marquette , stood over the boy 's crib and passed a ball back and forth , as if conjuring the magic to come . Oliver gave little Vince his first ball , took the two-year-old outside to shoot it . When Marquette assistant Hank Raymonds showed up to recruit Oliver , the coach sat Vince Jr . on his lap until the boy squirmed away to dribble around . // After the divorce , relations between Michelle and Vince Sr. became bitter . They had had another son , Chris , two years younger than Vince Jr. , and sometimes there was conflict over delayed child-support payments . Harry believes that Vince Sr. cared for his sons but would too often find reasons for not spending time with them . ( Vince Sr. denies this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the void . Harry interacted with the boys more than Vince Sr. ever had . He was the one taking little Vince to Disney World , going fishing , being a dad . " It was n't , Michelle says , until Vince 's senior year at Mainland High in Daytona Beach that Vince Sr. began showing up at his son 's games . " By that time all the accolades were coming , " she says . " The next year Vince went off to North Carolina , and then Vince Sr. disappeared again . " // Vince Jr . heard plenty of that from his mother . No one is closer to Vince than Michelle , now 46 and retired from teaching . She is her son 's counselor and best friend , his business partner and the head of his charity foundation . By all accounts Michelle fiercely protects her son and springs at the chance to keep him honest . When Vince 's grades fell at North Carolina , Michelle did n't hesitate to take away his car . She monitors his on-and off-court behavior like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstar , " Michelle says . " I see so many of these NBA moms , dads too , who are like puppets to their children  --  all because of the money . Sure , we have a lot more money now , but I can live for a lot less and be fine . I 'm not going to trade being a parent for money . And he knows that . " // In high school , despite Michelle 's open hostility toward Vince Sr. , Vince Jr . could n't help feeling happy when he 'd see his father on the other side of the gym , far from his mom , far from his stepdad , who led the high school band . He insists that his father came to see him play often , from his sophomore year on , and even traveled to Chapel Hill a few times to see him compete in college . Michelle would tell her son that Vince Sr. only wanted to latch on to the gravy train that was coming . " But I did n't care , " Carter says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me play . I enjoyed having all of them there . " // He never told his friends how hard it could be finding a line to walk among the feuding people in his life , being friendly to all , telling those on each side of any discussion that they had " a valid point . " He could lose himself playing saxophone in the school band during the off-season , could revel in becoming the school 's drum major as a senior  --  but then , Harry Robinson oversaw the band , did n't he ? There was only one place Carter could go where neither fans nor recruiters nor relatives nor problems could follow . " Old Faithful , " he calls it . // " I go to basketball , " he says . " I 've had a lot of friends ask how I go on without talking about things . I do n't forget them . I put them in my pocket and try to close that pocket and save them for later . When things are going badly , I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the frustrations , I let them go . Even when I miss , they 're going away . That 's helped my jump shot . Working out those frustrations : just shooting , shooting , shooting , and after two or three hours I feel fine . Then I go home . " // This past year he found himself doing far too much shooting . Last February his agent , William ( Tank ) Black , a man he called Uncle Tank , was charged with swindling clients and laundering drug money ( SI , May 29 , 2000 ) . Carter and his mother held on longer than any of Black 's other clients , but in March , when Michelle saw an ESPN report on Black that kept flashing pictures of her son , the camel 's back snapped . The Carters fired Black a couple of days later , saying he had bilked Vince out of $300,000 . Vince will never forget telling the media in February that he supported Black " 100 percent "  --  only to find out , he says , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Black is in a federal prison in Milan , Mich. , awaiting sentencing for money laundering , to which he pleaded guilty on Jan. 17 . He still faces charges in Florida that he defrauded his clients of $15 million , to which he has pleaded not guilty . Carter has n't spoken to Black since firing him . // After Tank came the deluge . In March , Michael Jordan , the man with whom Carter had been compared since he went to Carolina as a dunk artist , ignored Tar Heel solidarity and stated that Kobe Bryant was a better all-around player than Carter because of his commitment to defense . In June , following the Raptors ' first-round playoff sweep by the New York Knicks , Vince 's coach , Butch Carter ( no relation ) , the man who 'd given him confidence  --  " He let me blossom , and I do n't think I would 've gotten that opportunity elsewhere , " Vince says  --  was fired . In July , Vince 's attempt to waggle out of his endorsement deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company $13-5 million , and not until September did Carter learn that Nike would pay him more than twice that amount : $30 million over five years . // In August , Tracy McGrady , Carter 's distant cousin and closest teammate , bolted Toronto and signed a free-agent contract with the Orlando Magic , saying he needed to carve out his own space . Worse , McGrady 's mother said her son had grown tired of hearing about Carter day in and day out . // Carter was stunned . The day he heard of McGrady 's feelings toward him , someone asked him what would happen the first time the two played against each other . " Pick a number between 30 and 50 , " Carter snarled . No one , he says , had reveled more than he in the cousins ' rise as a Dynamic Duo . " I needed Tracy , " Carter says . " I enjoyed seeing on TV : Tracy and Vince , the Vince and Tracy Show . I loved having two family members on the same team . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGrady 's comments " bothered me for a long time , " Carter continues . " It was wild . My head was spinning so fast . I read his mother 's quotes ; then people said he was saying the same things on TV . I said , ' Fine . If that 's how he feels , so be it . ' I could n't find enough guts to call him and say , ' What 's going on ? ' " // It was the classic Carter reaction : Slide away . Learn to live with it . McGrady , who insists he never had any problem being in Carter 's shadow in Toronto , says he called Carter repeatedly to try to clear the air , but Carter refused to call back . " I was shocked , " McGrady says . " I was trying to find out what I had said for him to act like that . Finally I said , ' This is bull  --   --  . ' " // Carter had other family fires to contend with too . A week before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Harry were divorcing . " I thought she was joking , " he says . Then , on Sept. 22 , while he was in Australia , his 22-year-old brother , Chris , was arrested in Florida and charged with felony possession of cocaine . It was Chris 's eighth arrest in two years , and if Vince did n't feel responsible , exactly , he knew he had n't made his brother 's life easy . // The two boys had grown up in basketball , pummeling each other on the hot asphalt courts of Daytona Beach , often ending their games fighting . Chris was consumed by basketball but lacked his older brother 's gift . He played jayvee ball as a freshman at Mainland High while Vince embellished his legend as a senior , and every day Chris heard from opponents , friends and fans that he was n't as good as Vince . Worse , Vince 's manner was so winning that it was no easier for Chris off the court . Michelle did everything she could to build Chris 's confidence . She even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would n't let Chris be Chris , " she says . " If he dunked , he would n't dunk as hard as Vince ; if he scored 24 against Orange Park , Vince had scored 26 . Chris even had a teacher in his language-arts class , and of all the students ' poems she brings out to use as a model , she brings out one of Vince's. // " So I 'm Chris , " Michelle says , " and in my mind I 've got to live up to my brother , who always says the right thing and does the right thing . Everybody adores Vince . Is it the second coming ? I mean , they said Jesus Christ is coming back . Is this it ? " // From Vince 's standpoint there was almost nothing he could do that would n't make the situation worse . Of all the things that piled on him last summer , Chris 's struggles weighed the most . " I think about Chris all the time , " Vince says . " We talk on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . I let him know it 's all in the past . I do n't hold the arrests over his head . I wish he 'd look toward the future and try to better himself . He 'd say , ' O.K. , I 'm going to get better , ' but he never did . // " He did n't think I cared about him . He said , ' You 're an NBA superstar now ; you do n't think about me . ' That 's far from the truth . One of my greatest joys was when my brother came here last year for our game against the Lakers . There 's that fine line of not wanting to put it in his face , but I wanted him to be here . He got the chance to see it up close and personal  --  what I do , what it 's like , what he sees on TV and what really goes on , word for word , step by step , body to body . He was right there , third seat from the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I played . He loved it . " // In November , Chris pleaded no contest to the cocaine charges and received two years of probation . In early December , on the Raptors ' team bus in Utah , Charles Oakley , talking to McGrady on his cell phone , handed the phone to Carter and said , " Someone wants to talk to you . " The two talked for 30 minutes . " I said , ' Of course people will tell you what I said , but you ca n't buy that , ' " McGrady says . " ' You 've got to come to me to see what 's going on . Our relationship is too tight to split over something like this . ' " Carter agreed , and the two now speak regularly , but Carter feels it will take time before the relationship gets back on its old footing . // They were scheduled to meet when the Raptors traveled to Orlando to play the Magic on Jan. 23 . Vince Carter Sr. planned to be at that game too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought himself . He lives in Orlando , and he said this month that he had talked to his son only twice in the past three years . He said he does n't understand why he no longer has a place in Vince 's life . Neither does his son . " I do n't know , " says Vince Jr . " Things fizzled out on both sides . It just sort of happened . " // Vince Sr. says if s no coincidence that contact with his son began to fizzle as Vince 's career at North Carolina began to take off . " Because she wanted to be in control and did n't want me in control , " he says . " I have no problem with that , but the attempt to sabotage my character ? Why was that ? " // Since her son 's college years Michelle has so emphatically told reporters that Vince Sr. was never a part of Vince 's life that many people thought Carter 's biological father was dead . Vince Sr. hears this and winces . Recovering , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He says he does n't want any money from his son , though he volunteers he 'd be glad to advise him for 1% of his earnings . " The one thing I 'd like to know from Vincent ? " his father says . " What is it like to be where you are ? " But Vince Sr. worries that the wall built around Vince by Michelle and by Vince 's own personality has become too thick to penetrate . // " I 've approached Vincent many times in the past and said , ' What have I done ? ' " Vince Sr. says . " He said , ' No , there 's nothing . ' I do n't understand . I 've never been incarcerated ; I 'm a hardworking man , and I do n't need anything from him except that relationship . He 's my son . He 's been in the city and not called . It 's almost like he 's forbidden . Chris rocks the boat if he has to , but Vincent wants to see everybody happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you talk to my son , " Vince Sr. says , " tell him I said hi . " // TRACY McGRADY wants to make this clear : He loves Vince Carter . " I miss playing with him , " McGrady says . " Getting him those nice passes and seeing him do his thing , fancy dunks and all . We were bonding as the years went by ; he was always there for me , and I was there for him . Who knows ? We might end up playing together again . I 'd like to reunite . " // But ask McGrady whom he 'd rather play with , Carter or the man with whom he is constantly compared  --  Kobe Bryant  --  and McGrady goes silent for 30 seconds . Finally he says , " I 'm not answering that . " // It is a shimmering December Sunday . The champion LA Lakers have blown into Toronto for their annual appearance , the NBA marketers ' dream matchup : Vince against Kobe . Here 's a showdown between two of the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one game that , for a day at least , might shut up cranky oldsters like Karl Malone and Oakley , who surveys the NBA and says , " It 's over with . The best part of the league left when Michael left , Magic , Isiah , Bird .... The league is garbage . " // As if to hammer home the point , the Raptors come out looking a mess . Early on Carter produces an extraordinary behind-the-head , alley-oop dunk , but he and his teammates shoot 30% from the field . After missing a layup in the third quarter , Carter blows past the scorer 's table and hisses to himself , " You suck ! " Heading into the fourth , Toronto is behind by 12 points , and Bryant has outshot , outscored and outplayed Carter , at times cutting around him like a shopper rushing through a revolving door . // It 's tempting , at such moments , to view Carter 's 2-year career  --  the breakout performance in last year 's dunk contest at the Ail-Star Game , the hyped-up quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neal ) , his disappointing performance in last spring 's playoffs  --  as a compressed version of Jordan 's first six years in the league . Back then Jordan was often denigrated as an overhyped Nike product with no idea of how to win in the NBA , Chicago 's answer to the spectacular but clueless Dominique Wilkins . There 's a similar knock on Carter . // Then , in the fourth quarter of the Raptors-Lakers game , something happens . Kobe nails a jumper , forces Carter to jack up a horrific air ball and then sinks a clean 22-footer  --  a sequence accomplished with such ease that it verges on the embarrassing . Carter knows it . His expression shifts , and the game suddenly tightens . With less than five minutes to play and the Lakers up by 15 , all the energy on the floor changes ends . Carter sets up two baskets with sweet passes , nails a three-pointer from the top of the key and double-pumps his arms . // This is why people rave about Carter . Besides his 28.5 points , 5.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , when aroused , impose a presence that no number can measure . Like Jordan , he gets his points within the team flow ; you often look up at halftime stunned to see that he 's scored 20 . He has lifted his game this season . His three-point shooting , 11th in the NBA at a 41% clip , is the best it has ever been . Despite his weakened supporting cast , Carter has amassed his share of late-game heroics , hitting winners in the final seconds and even  --  are you watching , Michael ?  --  making the key defensive play . Against the Knicks on Dec. 14 , Carter stripped the ball from Allan Houston with 30 seconds to go , made two free throws to take the lead and then ferociously blanketed Houston on a three-pointer that would 've won it . // Now , against L.A. , Carter is at it again . Here 's what everyone wanted : Kobe and Vince pushing each other , making the league matter and , for one afternoon , turning this Canadian metropolis into a basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS CONVINCED . " He 's Mr. Toronto , " says the mayor , Mel Lastman. // Kind of . Like Wayne Gretzky playing hockey in Los Angeles , Carter inhabits a unique netherworld where he is both celebrity and afterthought . A recent NBA poll ranked him as the favorite athlete for English-speaking Canadian youngsters and second only to Gretzky among those aged nine to 54 . Yet NBA television ratings in Canada are abysmal . Last May 19 a playoff doubleheader got pounded by a repeat of the Westminster Dog Show . Raptors broadcasts nationwide attract nearly a million fewer viewers than local broadcasts of the Maple Leafs , but what 's worse is that after five years , Raptors broadcasts still stand no chance when they go head-to-head with championship curling . // One reason is cultural , but another is that few Canadians believe Carter will stay . They look at his Florida upbringing , his Yankee showmanship and McGrady 's acrimonious departure , and they have little doubt that once Carter 's contract expires at the end of next season , he will head south for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there , " McGrady says . Carter wo n't say that . The Toronto organization , the big-city resources and small-town feel , the new arena  --  all combine to make him rave about Canada . " I love it here , " he insists . // Much depends on whether that remains true . The Grizzlies struggle daily to gain purchase in Vancouver amid constant talk about the franchise 's moving somewhere south . Though Toronto averages 19,121 fans a game , no one is under any illusion about the impact of a Carter departure . " As far as I 'm concerned , " Lastman says , " there 's no team without Vince Carter . " // Not today , certainly . Only 4.6 seconds remain . The Raptors have outscored the Lakers 15-2 , and Carter is going to the free throw line with Toronto down 91-89 and a chance to tie . People stand and scream , the music pounds . He shoots without hesitating , hits both shots , clenches a fist and pumps it hard . And he 's not finished . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final play . Bryant grabs the ball beyond the top of the key and goes skyward to shoot . Carter peels off his man in the lane and in two steps leaps to slap away the ball at the buzzer . Overtime . Payback . Carter nods to the crowd as the building vibrates . // He has produced an astonishing run that showcases exactly the quality that makes him rare  --  yet he remains suspect . Because he needed Bryant to provoke him . Because Carter got angry , says Raptors forward Antonio Davis , and it changed everything , and there are too many days when Carter does n't get angry enough . " Vince needs to find something that 's going to motivate him to be as aggressive as he is when he 's mad , " says Davis . " Because when he 's not , he 's a totally different player . " // This is the common complaint about Carter . Oakley is driven to distraction whenever he sees Carter grinning and slapping hands with opponents before games , and if the folks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , hugging Ur-Dukie Christian Laettner , they might have burned that Carter jersey they just retired . " Kobe ai n't dealing with other teams ' guys , " Oakley says . Even Carter 's IMG agent , a former player named Merle Scott , calls his client " too nice . " // Translated , it all means that Carter too often sees the pro game as a game , instead of the cutthroat scramble for respect , money and championships that everyone else knows it is . But Vince inside the arena is Vince outside . He possesses plenty of bile , but his first impulse is to squelch it . Vince wants to see everybody happy . // Champions , of course , do n't care if anybody 's happy . Champions are n't nice . Champions invent reasons to destroy their opponents , and an 82-game season demands a gift for creating conflict where none exists . " I do n't think he 's ever yelled at anybody in his life , " Davis says , and it makes Davis nervous . Over and over he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You need to help me .... " No ! Davis wants to yell . Curse him out ! Get your point across ! The Carter behavior so reviled in Australia ? Davis was one of the Raptors hoping Vince would bring it home . // " I tell him time and time again : He 's the guy , " Davis says . " He has to do it . We 're going to listen to anything he says , no matter if we disapprove . But it 'll come . He 'll blow up one time this season , and it 's going to be a great day . He 'll say , ' Oh , this ai n't bad . They 're listening to me . ' Look at all the greats . All of them in some ways were a  --   --   --  - : Muhammad Ali , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar . It 's that edge you need . " // And Carter ? " His edge is the excitement , " continues Davis . " His edge is the highlights , dunking , the oohs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motivation . Your motivation should be that you want to win . " // Until Carter learns to spark his own fire and , most important , coldly calculate when to make it rage , he 'll remain unfinished . He idolized both Jordan and Wilkins growing up , and there 's no way to predict which one he 'll end up resembling . He often gets motivated enough to make things interesting but not consistently enough to lift his team to victory . In overtime against the Lakers he grabs four rebounds but ca n't score . Bryant makes two key free throws and easily blocks Carter 's driving layup with 13 seconds to play . L.A. wins by three . Bryant finishes with 40 points on 29 shots , Carter with 31 points on 32 shots . In a few hours every player around the league knows what happened and why . // " You know who got the best of it , " McGrady says . " Who won that game ? Who had the most points ? Who had fewer shots and more points ? Kobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vince is by himself and has to do a lot more work . But Kobe plays both ends . To be great , you have to master both ends of the court . Do n't just be a scorer . " // In the weeks to come , Carter will speak of how his defense will improve . He 'll speak of how the people who say he 's too nice have " a valid point " and how he " can take that kind of criticism . " He 'll say his proudest moment of the season came when he picked the Knicks ' Houston clean , then threw off Houston 's final shot . " It was n't close , " Carter says proudly . However , there was another moment down the stretch of that game when Carter turned to the crowd and waved his arms and screamed to the fans at the Air Canada Centre , " Get the f  --  - up ! " A TV camera caught his face and the words , and he suddenly looked like the Vince Carter of Sydney , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called his mother just before midnight , she did n't even say hello . " What did you say in the fourth quarter ? " she thundered . " You do n't talk like that ! What got into you ? " // Her son said he was sorry once , twice , three times and more . He did n't want his mother mad , so he kept apologizing and promised never to do that again . She finally stopped talking about it , and they moved on to nicer topics . They both knew he 'd keep his promise . He might not like it much , but he could learn to live with that too .
