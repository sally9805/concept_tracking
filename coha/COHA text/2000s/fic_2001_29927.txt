Richard 1984 When I was twenty-three , I thought I was pretty hot stuff . I enrolled at Columbia University in New York , much to the chagrin of Mother and everybody else I knew . Why the hell do you want to live in that horrible place ? Why ca n't you get your master 's at Carolina ? If you want an MBA , go to Harvard ! New York City is no place for a girl like you ! What do you want a master 's for anyway ? You 're just gon na get married and the whole thing will be a waste of your money ! I was highly tempted to reply that the reason I was moving to New York was to get away from people like them ! But the nice southern girl in me could n't bring myself to do it . We tried to keep our sass to a minimum . A hopeless endeavor . Actually , I think the reason I did choose Columbia was simply for the experience of living in a major city and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had toyed with the idea of becoming an investment banker and a tree power broker . But that was n't what Life 's Great Plan had in store for me . I had signed up for a psychology course as an elective , joking to myself that maybe I 'd finally figure out my family if I could understand the machinations of the human psyche . In particular , I wanted to understand why I was so driven to leave South Carolina and why my family was so compelled to stay . One hundred and seventy-five students were gathered in a small auditorium for class . The first day , lost and frazzled , I arrived a few minutes late . The professor , Richard Levine , was already lecturing . The hall was dead silent when I pushed the door open . He stopped talking and looked at me . So did everyone else . I was mortified . " Nice of you to join us , Miss ... ? " " Wimbley , " I said in a low voice , hoping he 'd forget my name as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was gorgeous . He looked a bit like Steve Martin and sounded like a diplomat . I wondered if he was married . From where I sat in the top row , I could n't see a ring . " Class begins at eight , Miss Wimbley , not " he stopped and looked at his watch " not at eight-fifteen . " He was smirking at me ! It was obvious he knew I thought he was attractive . I could tell by the smirk . " Yes , thank you . Sorry , sir . " I tried to hide my fascination with his face . " Whittaker ? Kindly pass this to Miss Wimbley . " He handed a sheet of paper to a fellow down front and it was passed back to me . I must 've looked confused because he spoke to me again . " It 's a syllabus , Miss Wimbley , not a summons for jury duty . " The class laughed My neck got hot . Great , I thought , this guy is gon na think I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jokes at the expense of others were not funny to me . I suppose I was overly sensitive . How about I was just embarrassed ? " As the great Freud said , What does a woman want ? ' " he said . Every male in the class guffawed and elbowed each other , agreeing with the professor . He was clearly pleased with himself . I knew that unless I wanted to be taken lightly , I 'd better come up with a retort . I raised my hand . " Yes , Miss Wimbley ? " " And the great Proust said , All the great things we know have come to us from neurotics ! ' " This took the class to the heights of hysteria while my professor , with the widest smile and cutest dimples , raised his arms over his head as if he were begging for mercy . The women in the class whooped and hollered . " Dear God ! She claims that Freud was neurotic ! " " Proust said it , sir , not me . " He pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now nearly out of control . " I 'll see you after class , Miss Wimbley . " I could n't wait for the hour to end . We went out for coffee , and my days as Miss Bon Vivant , cyclone of the dance clubs , screeched to a fast finish . From the minute I saw him and heard him speak , I was so stupid over him , I could n't sleep . He even made me feel like cooking ! The next Monday , I invited him to my tiny studio apartment for dinner and when he accepted , I began to perspire . I could n't boil water ! I went to Zabar 's and straight to the fattest man I could find at the butcher 's counter . I figured a fat butcher would know the difference between shoe leather and a steak I waited patiently for a man who had the name Abe embroidered on his apron . " How much do you love this man ? " he said to me . " Enough to cook , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Betty Crocker . " " Youse southern and youse ca n't cook ? Do n't make no sense . " " Yeah , well , I can learn ? " " Humph . " He looked me over like I should 've been in the display case on crushed ice with parsley in my hair . " Too skinny , " he said to no one in particular , which irked me . " Well , then , sell me some food , Abe ! He 's coming at seven ! " " Take the veal chops . Rub ' em down with lemon juice , a little olive oil , fresh rosemary , salt and pepper . Cook ' em three minutes on each side under the broiler . Wrap ' em up in tinfoil for five minutes to rest . Give it to him with a baked potato and a salad with Roquefort dressing . Do n't forget bread . You 'll have dis bum eating outta da palm of ya hand . " " Thanks , Abe , " I said , " I 'll let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chops ? Dar poor sucker do n't stand a chance ! " I walked home to my studio on Ninety-fourth and Columbus , whistling a little tune . Then I realized I did n't have anything to drink for dinner and what the hell went with veal anyway ? I stopped at a liquor store and poked around until the salesman was finished with another customer . He sold me two bottles of a pinot noir and I was on my way again , buoyed by false confidence . When I got home , it hit me . I did n't have a table and chairs ! God , was I stupid or what ? My first-floor , L-shaped studio was so sparse the occasional visitor could n't tell if I was moving in or out . I had a sofa and one huge armchair with a hassock , a stereo , no rug , tons of books on board-and-brick bookshelves , and a bed in the alcove . I had two hours to turn the miserable hole into something alluring . I 'd ask the doorman what to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on duty . He was from Puerto Rico and , in the true spirit of Latin men , he flirted with me every time I saw him . He held the door for me and took the shopping bag from my hands . I was gon na give him a chance to prove his nerve . " Good afternoon , Miss Wimbley ! " " Darios ? I 'm in big trouble and I need your help ! " In the dim light of the basement , Darios and I rummaged through the storage bins of possessions left by other tenants for safekeeping . It could 've been the home furnishing department at Bloomingdale 's , I had so many choices . It did n't bother me one ounce that these things belonged to other people . Tomorrow they 'd go back to where they had been . " Come over here ! This is the Goldbergs ' stuff . They 're in Hawaii ! " " Perfect ! " He hauled the rug out first . " You wan na see it ? " " Nope . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We chose a small round walnut table and two ladder-back chairs that were stacked on the side of the chicken-wire pen and within ten minutes my apartment looked one hundred percent better . Darios and I stepped back to observe . " Needs plants , " he said . " Jesus , Darios , I can hardly afford this meal ! " I was living on a tight budget imposed by Mother , probably to make me transfer to Carolina . " Be right back . " The doorbell rang again and it was Darios with two enormous palms from the lobby . He put them in place on either end of the sofa and I gave him twenty dollars . At the door he said , " I 'd rather have just one kiss . " " Go on now , you bad boy , or I 'll tell your wife ! " I only felt like a criminal again for a few seconds . My mind returned to the mission , which was , even though I would have loudly and energetically denied it , to seduce Richard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old quilt from the closet and it covered the table to the floor . Flowers ? Of course not . But I had books and that would work . I took three small volumes from the shelves , one of Proust , one of Flannery O'Connor , and the last , a book of Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's poetry . I used bronze bookends of hunting dogs to hold them upright . I wondered if he would notice the Proust . Fortunately I had two votive candles , two unchipped plates , and enough matching flatware . Linen napkins ? Not a chance . I used clean red dishtowels , which matched the quilt , sort of , and spray-starched them to death on a towel on the floor . In the end , the living area looked pretty darn cozy . Then there was the matter of the bed . You ca n't hide a bed in a studio and mine was piled with stuffed animals from my youth . No man in his right mind could feel sexy surrounded by Snoopy dogs and Paddington Bears . I stuck them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , but no den of iniquity either . It was a box spring and mattress on a Harvard frame on wheels . Not even a headboard . Big deal . Suddenly I wished I had the time and available cash to run to Laura Ashley and cover my bed in beautiful white linens and lacy pillows . I dug through my linen closet with a fury , pulling out everything and anything that would even mildly suggest virginity . This search bore little fruit , but I did manage to find a set of sheets with scalloped edges I had forgotten about , and a deep rose , soft wool blanket . I plumped the bejesus out of my four sorry-ass beat-up pillows , sprayed them with cologne , and decided it would just have to do . In a moment of sheer brazenness , I turned the bed down . Nap , anyone ? I laughed out loud and looked at my watch . Six-fifteen . Forty-five minutes until kick-off . Okay , shower , shave , and moisturize . Fifteen minutes later I heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in a towel , and Richard was early . Shit ! What could I do ? Nothing . I opened the door and there he stood . " Am I early ? " he said , handing me a bouquet of the deepest red roses . " Oh ! Thank you ! Heavens to Betsy , no ! Come on in ! I was just , I was just , oh hell , did we say six-thirty ? I 'm sorry . " My temperature rose to about one hundred and seven from embarrassment as I shut the door . " I do n't remember , " he said , " forgive me . Caroline ? " " Yes ? " We were staring into each other 's eyes , my knees were inexplicably rubbery , and I felt like I was free-falling into space . " I never dreamed someone could be quite so fetching in a towel , " he said in a low quiet voice . God damn . He sounded like James Bond again . Then I looked down at my bare feet and recovered immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments to find her hoopskirts ! Better yet , why do n't you put on some music and open the wine ? " " Ah ! God knows I love a woman with wit ! Where 's the corkscrew ? " " Second drawer on the left of the stove . " I put his flowers in the sink and hopped by him to escape . He could n't resist tugging on my towel and I yelped and laughed . I did , however , lock the door to my bathroom while I did the fastest makeup and hair job of my life . I threw the proverbial sleeveless little black dress over my head , creamed the hell out of my legs and arms , and slipped on a pair of low-heeled black suede sandals . One gold bracelet , fake diamond studs . No doubt about it , I was going to have my way with him . He probably would n't even put up a fight . When I showed up in the kitchen doorway , he handed me a goblet of red wine and exhaled . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never left each other 's face . " I need to cook dinner , " I said . My voice was husky and uneven . " Would you mind terribly if I kissed you first ? I 've had the shape of your mouth on my mind all day . " I gasped . I could n't help it , but I gasped in surprise . Some seductress I was . " You have ? " Oh , yeah , Miss Groovy strikes again . He moved in closer until I could smell his breath , which bore the unmistakable traces of toothpaste . " Yes , I have , " he said and put his hand in the crook of my back , pulling me closer to him . " I smell mint , " I said and then chastised myself for saying something so stupid . He held me back for a moment and smiled . " Are you allergic to mint ? " " Hell , no , " I said , opening my eyes wide , knowing that each syllable I uttered made me sound more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mint ? " he said . I guess he thought torturing me was fun . " Yes ! " " Because I have cinnamon gum in my jacket and I could chew ... " " Richard ? " I pretended to faint , falling backward in his arm . " I 'm dying here ! " " Come here , pussycat , Uncle Richard wants to tickle your whiskers . " That was the end of that nonsense . By the time his mouth covered mine we had tasted each other 's breath , teased each other 's mind , and kicked the ball to the thirty-yard line . To my complete amazement , his lips fit mine so perfectly , it was like kissing my twin . My arms were around his neck and even though I was considered tall , I had to stand on my tiptoes to reach his face with mine . It was the kiss of a lifetime , the kind you read about , not the kind you got . The longer he held me , the more emboldened I became . When he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You 're not wearing panties . " I said , " Oops . Got dressed too fast . " His tongue traveled my neck , stopping here and there for a nip . " I 'll overlook it this time , " he said . " Do n't let it happen again . " That seemed like a good breaking point to me . If we did n't stop then , we would n't stop all night , so I said , " Listen , bubba , we 'd better give it a rest . Nice southern girls do n't just peel down on the first date , you know . " " Bubba ? " I slipped away from him and led him to the living room . " You stay here while I cook , okay ? " I pushed him into the overstuffed chair and put his feet up on the hassock . " Caroline ? What is bubba ? And where is my wine ? " I picked up his glass , refilled it , and brought it to him . " In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinner was delicious and I thought briefly about Abe the butcher and how I had created this set for The Love Boat from the Goldbergs ' stash and the lobby plants . Wynton Marsalis played low and moanful in the background . While we drank both bottles of wine , he told me about his childhood . He could 've read me the want ads and I would 've thought it was poetry . His story was a tearjerker . He was born in London , the only son of a successful jeweler . He lost his mother to ovarian cancer when he was only twelve years old . His father had remarried shortly after that to a divorce with three young children of her own . He was sent to boarding school , as he and his stepmother had major differences . He distinguished himself academically and went on to medical school , where he decided he wanted to be a psychologist . Richard was doing his dissertation when he met his first wife , Lois . Evidently , nothing good came from that marriage except an infant son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this I was lost in his hazel eyes . They had little flecks of green and gold in them . Between dinner and dessert , Richard 's hand found its way to under my dress . We were definitely on the road to Sodom . " There 's something on my leg , " I said , feigning fright . " Do n't worry , I can cure your delusion , " he said . " I 'm holding out for my wedding night . " " Marry me . " " Okay . " The strange part was that I meant it . I knew , that very first night we were together , that I would marry Richard . All the southern guys I ever went out with were polite and predictable . Not that they were n't just as good-looking as Richard or appealing in other ways They were truly lovely men . Maybe it was me , that I was n't ready to settle down . Probably . But there was something else about Richard . He was a little bit dangerouslike there was something in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sexy , I did n't want to spend one day alive without him . I had never felt that way before and I knew I never would again . I had this instantaneous belief that here was a man who could take care of meif he would . It was absolutely astounding . That night , he fell asleep on the sofa from grape overdose while I did the dishes . Propriety dictated that I should wake him up to go home . But , not me . I was so smitten and crazy about him , I covered him with a comforter , took off my dress and shoes , and went to bed nude . I rationalized the nude part by telling myself that Fate would rule the night . If he woke up and went home , he was a gentleman and therefore worthy husband material . If he woke up and got in bed with me , I 'd know more about what kind of husband he 'd be . If he slept on the sofa all night , he was a horse 's ass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to me . No , I smelled him first . Eau Sauvage . Jesus ! How perfect was that ? I pretended to be sleeping while his fingers traced my side . He snuggled up closer and we were like two spoons . I started to drift back to sleep , thinking in my haze how nice it felt to be curled up this way , how safe I felt . He started to shift his position and it did n't take long to figure out why . " Caroline ? " he said in a whisper . " Hmm ? " " Sorry to wake you , dear , but I ... " " Come here , Richard . I want you too . " That old bed of mine started to rock and squeak , and if our mouths seemed tailor-made for each other , the rest of our bodies were like Legos . He made me feel so exhilarated , I wanted to scream , but I could n't have caught my breath long enough for anything more than gasping for air . Making love with Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , so terrified , and so thrilled at the same time . Yes , indeedy , this man was a keeper . When the sun came up and woke us , the bed was five feet away from the wall and the sheets were off the mattress . If not for the Goldbergs ' carpet , we would 've rolled right into the living room . We laughed our heads off . I had met my match .
