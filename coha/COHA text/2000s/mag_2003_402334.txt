Lignans can be beneficial for both men and women . Lignans can act as antioxidants . Lignans are phytoestrogens. // Flaxseed has been around for centuries but its popularity with consumers has increased greatly over the past few years-and for good reason . Flax is a healthy food containing a mix of beneficial nutrients . It is high in omega-3 fatty acids and contains fair amounts of fiber , both soluble and insoluble . Flax is also one of the richest sources of lignans1-compounds that are increasingly being studied for their potential benefits to health . This article will discuss flax lignans in more detail and hopefully answer your questions about what lignans are and how they can be beneficial for both men and women . Lignans are phytoestrogens , or naturally occurring plant estrogens that can have a balancing effect on hormones . Lignans can also act as antioxidants . The main lignan in flaxseed is secoisolariciresinol diglycoside or SDG . When flaxseed is eaten , SDG , is converted by bacteria in the colon to mammalian lignans : enterolactone and enterodiol . This is important because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health effects in the body . The amount of enterolactone and enterodiol found in the blood and urine of humans and animals is related to the amount of plant lignans eaten . Large intakes of flaxseed ( and SDG ) will result in large amounts of enterodiol and enterolactone excretion . Photograph BPH is a non-cancerous condition where the prostate becomes enlarged . // Lignans for Men 's Health Lignans have many potential benefits for men , specifically in areas related to prostate health . A great deal of attention is being focused on benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) because it is a growing public health problem . The American Urological Association estimates that BPH affects 50 percent of men aged 50 to 60 and up to 90 percent of men over the age of 80 . Simply stated , BPH is a non-cancerous condition where the prostate becomes enlarged . This can be a problem because the urethra , the tube carrying urine from the bladder to outside the body , runs through the prostate ( see illustrations ) . A growing prostate can pinch off the urethra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to urinate , and painful urination . The exact cause of BPH is unknown , but male hormones seem to play a role . Hormones also play a role in another prostate condition-prostate cancer , the second leading cause of cancer death among men . In the body , testosterone is converted to a more potent form called dihydrotestosterone or DHT . Normal , healthy prostate cells require DHT for growth . However , it is thought that too much of this hormone can cause abnormal growth-leading to BPH or causing prostate cancer cells to divide . Therefore , compounds that interfere with the conversion of testosterone to DHT could reduce a man 's chances of developing these diseases . Lignans have been shown to block the action of the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT.2 Lignans may also reduce the amount of testosterone available for the body to use . In the average male , only a small amount of testosterone roams free in the blood . Most testosterone is bound to a protein called SHBG ( sex hormone binding globulin ) . People who consume large amounts of lignans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An increase in SHBG leaves less testosterone available to stimulate prostate cell growth . In other studies researchers have found that lignan concentrations are higher in the prostate fluid of men with a lower risk of prostate cancer than those at increased risk.4 In a more recent study , 25 prostate cancer patients were given a low-fat diet plus flaxseed . At the end of the study , the men had a reduction in testosterone levels , lower rates of cancer cell growth and a trend towards lower prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) levels.5 The study was done with whole flaxseed , so the authors could n't determine how much of the effect was due to lignans . Therefore they conducted another study using lignans derived from flaxseed . Results showed that the lignans inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cells in a test tube.6 This supports the idea that lignans are protective against prostate cancer . While it is too early to say that eating flaxseed and its lignans will reduce the risk of prostate cancer and BPH , evidence is pointing in that direction . By reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lignans might help reduce prostate size , alleviate symptoms of BPH and protect against prostate cancer . Lignans and Women 's Health Lignans also have health benefits for women . Because lignans are phytoestrogens , they have the potential to help reduce symptoms of menopause . There are n't many studies yet that have looked at lignans for menopause symptoms . However , one study found a reduction in mild menopause symptoms in women who ate 40 grams of crushed flaxseed per day.7 Early research also suggests lignans may protect against hormone related cancers in women , such as breast cancer . Protective effects have been shown in rats fed flaxseed8,9,1 or lignans from flax.11 However , human studies are more suggestive than conclusive at this point . Observation studies have found that breast cancer patients and people at high risk of breast cancer excrete less mammalian lignans than people with a lower risk of breast cancer.12 A study in Finland found that women with high enterolactone levels in their blood had a lower risk of breast cancer.15 These studies suggest that breast cancer may be more common in people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the effects of flaxseed on es trogen metabolism in postmenopausal women . The women who ate ground flaxseed had lower amounts of sex hormones associated with breast cancer.14 Authors of the study suggested that lignans played a role , although it was not directly proven that lignans were the only compounds producing the beneficial effects . However , lignans have been shown to inhibit estrogen-stimulated growth of breast cancer cells in a test tube , 15 suggesting that lignans do play a significant role in the anticancer activity of flaxseed . As with prostate disease , the above studies are not concrete proof that women who eat flaxseed are less likely to get breast cancer . However , evidence is accumulating . Other potential health benefits Lignans are also of interest in many other health conditions besides those mentioned above . To name a few , lignans are being studied for potential benefits in heart health , against colon cancer and surprisingly , even hair loss . The same hormones that can cause BPH are implicated in causing hair loss in men and women . Therefore , lignans may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may protect the prostate . Although much larger and longer studies need to be done to determine how much of the effects are due to lignans or other components in flaxseed , research indicates that lignans , in combination with the other nutrients in flax , may be a healthy addition to the daily diet . How to select a lignan rich flax product . Although flaxseed is the richest source of lignans , consumers are not guaranteed that their flax has a certain amount of lignans . Ground flaxseed contains lignans but flax oil is void of lignans due to processing . There are some flax oil products that claim to be high lignan but rarely offer a standardized amount . A new generation of flax products are appearing on the market which are made from flax hulls , or the outer portion of the flaxseed . Flax hulls naturally contain up to 10 times more lignans than regular ground flaxseed because the hull is where most flax lignans are found . Dietary supplement manufacturers arc recognizing this and are beginning to make products with ingredients that are standardized sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flax hull concentrate .
