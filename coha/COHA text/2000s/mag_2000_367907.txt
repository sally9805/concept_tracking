It was another tabloid week for the Olympic movement . At the track-and-field trials in Sacramento , Calif. , sprinters Michael Johnson and Maurice Green moved their gums as fast as their legs , trading insults at a record pace . On the human-interest front , there was Marla Runyan , legally blind , qualifying for the team at 1,500 m , and Gabe Harmony Jennings , a happy eccentric from Forks of Salmon , Calif. , announcing himself as a miler to be reckoned with . Finally there was Magnificent Marion Jones qualifying for what seemed to be every event . <P> There was lots of crime news in the big type too . Over in Utah , a 15-count indictment was handed up against Salt Lake City bid-committee principals Tom Welch and Dave Johnson in connection with the $1.2 million in graft that preceded  --  led to ?  --  Salt Lake 's selection by the International Olympic Committee as host of the 2002 Winter Games . The feds went ballistic on Welch and Johnson because they would n't cop a plea to bribing I.O.C. members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time was n't against I.O.C. policy  --  it was I.O.C. policy . <P> The indictment in Salt Lake overshadowed other news from a Denver courtroom that may ultimately prove far more troublesome for the Olympics . In filing a wrongful-termination lawsuit , Dr. Wade Exum , director of the U.S.O.C. 's drug-control unit for nine years before he stepped down under pressure last month , charged among other things that his bosses systematically covered up illicit drug use . " In recent years , absolutely no sanction has been imposed on roughly half of all the American athletes who have treated positive for prohibited substances , " Exum alleged . He said that his tests had turned up " scores " of athletes using strength-building testosterone but that no one had been punished . The U.S.O.C. said Exum 's charges were hogwash . <P> Assuming the U.S.O.C. is correct , we might ask , in the interest of Olympic glory , " What do you mean , our guys are n't taking drugs ? " Chemistry long ago supplanted Wheaties as the breakfast of champions among elite athletes . Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who admitted to spending about $12,000 a year on steroids and human-growth hormones during his career , said a majority of Australian athletes used performance enhancers and were encouraged to do so by Olympic officials . In Cuba , track officials refused to suspend world record-holding high jumper Javier Sotomayor after he tested positive for cocaine , and Jamaican track officials reacted similarly after sprinter Merlene Ottey tested positive for steroids .
