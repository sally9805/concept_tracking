Chapter One Five years later Mom would have been sad today . She would have been waiting here with tears in her eyes . Caroline knew this because on the day she 'd picked up her own senior year schedule , she 'd come out of this very same high school to find her adoptive mother , Macie , and Sam 's natural mother sitting in the car sniffling . Her mother had put a smile on her face and said how excited she was for Caroline . But there was a pile of crumpled tissues on the car seat that said otherwise . It seemed so wrong for Caroline to be sitting in her mother 's stead , waiting for Macie to pick up her schedule with her heart beating in joyful anticipation . Maybe it was shame , maybe it was the August heat , or maybe it was the disgraceful excitement-in any case , sweat beaded on Caroline 's brow and dampened her shirt , and her hair clung uncomfortably to the nape of her neck . She lifted her hair and fanned herself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a death grip since she 'd found it in the mailbox . Macie a senior . It had once seemed this day would never come . But the endless months of filling in for both mother and father-homework and sex talks , discipline and curfews-were nearly at an end . From her view now , near the end of the six-year stretch between their parents ' deaths and both Sam and Macie being in college , the time seemed to have passed in a flash . Perspective was a funny thing . Waves of heat radiated off the blacktop , making the yellow buses parked like a line of dominoes seem to quiver , ready to topple . White-hot sun reflected off the windows of the other cars in the school parking lot . Caroline squinted against the glare , but no tears came . She was , however , feeling rather nauseated ; the uncomfortable temperature-or the shame . The small card in her hand did n't move much air . She could turn on the air conditioner , but gas was pricey and there was no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perspective Caroline doubted she 'd have if she had n't spent the last six years watching the budget , making certain there was enough money to see both of her siblings through college . In one year 's time , Caroline 's family responsibilities would be fulfilled . One last season of taking newspaper shots , yearbook pictures , and wedding photos ; then she could plunge into her photography career with all of the pent-up passion she 'd been suppressing . She could travel , expand her photographic horizons . Images of snowcapped mountains , vast rolling plains , and dramatic waterfalls set off a little thrill in the pit of her stomach . Maybe she could even land a magazine job and expose the want and suffering in nearly forgotten areas of the world . She could almost taste the freedom . Twelve short months . . . and she 'd be moving Macie into a university dorm room and driving away . That thought caused an unexpected hitch in her breath . As she pictured Macie standing alone on the sidewalk in front of a multistory institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tense worry mixed with a hollow aching sadness-a stark contrast to her giddy excitement of moments before . She stopped fanning and looked at the notice that was beginning to smudge from the dampness of her grip . Waiting for her at the post office was a contract with the Kentucky Department of Tourism for the use of her photographs in their new media campaign . It was a bigger break than she 'd hoped for . Unable to travel to exotic locales , she had focused her camera on her home state . And , quite unexpectedly , it was paying off . First , the photograph she had taken of Macie that long-ago frigid December night won a local , then a national contest . Then her shots of local events , local landmarks , and local people had caught the publisher 's eye . Her first published work , a calendar titled Kentucky Blue , had been the beginning . Now the year that calendar covered was three-quarters over . . . and she dared to lay a new plan . A **26;46;TOOLONG plan . An independent-woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chest . A fear that said something unforeseen , something in the same realm as the unlikely deaths of both her adoptive parents within weeks of each other , would happen to dash her dreams once again . Her palms itched . She wanted that contract , the proof that her days of dealing with cranky brides and recalcitrant students were blessedly numbered . She glanced at her watch . What was taking Macie so long ? Just as she was ready to go inside and see what was delaying Macie , her sister stepped out the front doors . Beside her was a tall , broad-shouldered boy with hair that was just a little too long for Caroline 's liking and a swagger that said he ate nice girls like Macie for dessert and spit them out before bedtime . Caroline sat up straighter in her seat and her mouth pulled into a disapproving frown . Macie and the man-boy paused at the bottom of the wide steps . He gestured as he said something that made Macie laugh . Caroline had her hand on the door handle before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macie away , as if she were a child unable to protect herself from a stranger . Not for the first time , Caroline experienced a new respect for her adoptive mother and the freedom she 'd given Caroline during her adolescent years . But that was different . I was n't sweet and shy and naive like Macie . Caroline had been baptized by fire early on and had never forgotten those painful lessons . Finally , the boy walked to a hunkered-down , fancy-wheeled , big-ass-winged Honda Civic . Macie stayed on the sidewalk , casting nervous glances toward Caroline , obviously not wanting Stud-man to know she was being carted around in an aging minivan by her much older sister . The Civic started up , its engine buzzing like a swarm of killer bees . The guy revved the engine as he swung past Macie . Macie smiled and waved . Caroline gritted her teeth . Oh , Macie , do n't go there , baby . Boys like that are nothing but a broken heart waiting to happen . She should know ; she 'd watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her eighth birthday . Caroline assured herself that Macie was a good girl , blessed with a level head . But the look on Macie 's face as she got in the car made Caroline question that assessment . In her most nonconfrontational voice , Caroline asked , " So , who was that ? " With something near stars in her eyes , Macie said , " Caleb Collingsworth . Just moved here two weeks ago . " " Oh , from where ? " Someplace tough and worldly and filled with trouble . " LA . " Bingo . Macie added , " He 's bored to death already . " " I 'll bet . " Macie 's gaze snapped her way . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Uh-oh , defensive about the guy already . " Nothing . " Caroline shook her head . " Nothing at all . " She started the car and pulled from the curb . Maybe Caleb Collingsworth would prove to be the player he appeared to be and go after a bigger fish , say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've been thinking about Mom , have n't you ? " Macie asked , her question vaporizing the image Caroline had conjured of Stud-man wooing Mrs. Kerrigan , the only female high school teacher under thirty . Caroline cut Macie a look . " What makes you say that ? " " You always fiddle with your necklace when you 've been thinking about her . " Caroline dropped the small gold heart that hung around her neck , as if caught doing something shameful . " It 's okay to miss her , Caroline . We all miss her . " What would Macie think if she knew just how selfish that " missing " had been ? Then Macie made her feel even worse . " It 'd be all right to cry sometimes ; you never cry . I cry almost as much now as I did then . " Caroline reached over and patted her sister on the leg . " That 's because you 're getting ready for a big step in your life . It 's natural to miss Mom and Dad more now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " You always do that . " " Now what am I doing ? " " Changing the subject away from your feelings . " Shooting her sister a grin , Caroline said , " That 's because I 'm old and do n't have feelings anymore . Just ask Sam . " Macie rolled her eyes and made a sound of exasperation . Looking for a safer subject , Caroline asked , " Is your schedule okay ? " Macie looked at the paper as if she 'd forgotten she had it . " Yeah . I have government first semester , so Laurel and I will be in the same class . " " That 's good . " Laurel and Macie had been inseparable since they were toddlers . Laurel 's family owned a farm down the road from the Rogers farm . " Will you drop me off at Laurel 's ? " Macie asked . " I told her I 'd come over and keep her company while she babysits her little brother . " Another delay in getting the contract , but Macie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-perceptive when it came to Caroline 's emotions ; she might see Caroline 's longing to escape as she looked at the contract for the first time . So she traded expediency for solitude . " Sure . " As they drove past their old farm on the way to Laurel 's , Caroline slowed and looked at the house . It had become such an ingrained habit that she hardly registered she was doing it . But today she slammed on the brakes and stopped in the middle of the country road . A tractor-trailer moving van was parked in the lane . " She 's moving ? " Macie asked with surprise . " It looks that way . Mrs. McGuire was supposed to notify me if it came on the market . " " Why ? " Macie looked at her with drawn brows . " Why what ? " Caroline strained to see if furniture was moving out or in . In would mean she could relax . Out , well that just left too much up in the air . " Why did you want Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caroline had never told Sam or Macie about the pressure that she 'd received when she sold the homestead after their parents ' deaths . Or her gut fear that once the property was in someone else 's hands , the fate she 'd worked so hard to avoid might still come to pass . She shrugged and tried to sound indifferent . " I just wanted to know . " She dropped Macie off and instead of heading to the post office , she drove straight to McGuire and McKinsey Real Estate . Mick Larsen watched the movers carry the antique wardrobe up the narrow staircase . He waited at the top of the curving steps , his body rigid with tension , his hands fisted . The wardrobe tilted slightly . Mick lunged forward and reached , as if he had a prayer of stopping the heavy piece from flipping over the banister from where he stood . His insides jerked into a knot as he waited for the sound of splintering wood . The wardrobe would be hard to replace , the banister impossible . Somehow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright . As they stepped into the upstairs hall , Butch , the bigger of the two men , called out , " Relax , Dr. Larsen . I told you we 'd take care of your stuff . " Mick cringed at the " Doctor " ; it was a title he no longer deserved . He 'd told the men early on to call him Mick . He nodded and managed a falsely confident smile as the men huffed on . Then he held his breath until he heard the wardrobe 's feet settle gently on the floor in the master bedroom . With a sigh of relief , he ran a hand along the thick handrail of the staircase in his new old home . He 'd grown up in a house like this , a house with a long history . He 'd lived his childhood surrounded by plank floors with secret squeaks , irreplaceable carved woodwork , and a dusty attic filled with spiders and uncountable treasures tucked in dry , crumbling boxes . He 'd taken such things for granted ; he still loved this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while attending medical school in Chicago-and living in a two-room apartment in a hundred-year-old house-he 'd met Kimberly , a brilliant and strong-willed neurology student , who loved abstract art , hard shiny surfaces , and lots of clean white space . She had come into his life at his moment of greatest doubt . He had been on the verge of leaving medical school . It had n't been his grades or the money-the two biggest catalysts for med school dropout . It had been his own lack of enthusiasm . After growing up in a family of doctors , after never once considering another life-path , Mick had suddenly feared his heart just was n't in it . He should have quit then ; if he had , lives now destroyed might still be whole . But at that point he 'd already let his father down by going into psychiatry , a specialty that barely qualified as real medicine in the Larsen family . The youngest and only male of the Larsen children , Mick had been slated from birth to join his father in family practice here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mick 's grandfather in that same practice . His sisters had gone above and beyond in upholding the family tradition , even though girl Larsen children were held to a different standard . Without so much as a prod from their father , the girls had all not only chosen medicine , but excelled in respectable specialties : Elise , a cardiologist ; Johanna , a pediatrician ; even the black sheep , Kerstin , was an oncologist . Mick 's fear of disappointing his father further had been the only thing that had kept him in school . At the point when Kimberly entered his life , that fear had been in danger of being overrun by self-doubt . Kimberly had stepped in , bolstered his confidence , quelled his questioning mind , and nudged him toward his degree and his license . By the time they 'd finished their residencies , they were a couple . He still was n't sure how , exactly , it had happened . They arrived at that point in sort of an unconscious drift ; neither of them had a lot of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago for Kimberly , who came from old Chicago money-and maybe , if he were honest with himself , to avoid facing his father 's disappointment head-on day after day . Shortly after Mick and Kimberly had moved into the ultramodern high-rise , Mick had begun collecting antiques . Living in that alien environment , the accumulation of items with a long and mysterious history made him feel less out of place . At first Kimberly had made him keep his " old junk " in the spare bedroom . That soon filled up and rich wood antiques began to spill first into their sterile-looking , minimalist bedroom , and then into the leather-and-glass living room . She had n't liked it . But , as it turned out , that was the tip of the iceberg when it came to things she disliked about Mick , his friends , and his love for things old . " That 's the last piece , Dr. Larsen , " Denny , the less-robust mover , said as he came back out of the master bedroom . Mick ground his teeth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Butch followed into the hall , Mick handed each man a fifty-dollar tip . " I appreciate all of the special care . " Both men would probably grumble over beers later ; but they 'd kept their good humor while Mick hovered like a worried mother as they 'd wrapped and carried his treasures . Once the movers had gone , he stood at the base of the stairs and looked around . He heard the drone of summer insects through the open doors and windows . Other than that , it was silent . After living in the city for years , he 'd forgotten what silence was like . He had n't anticipated the lonely feel of big , high-ceilinged rooms and acres upon acres of empty fields and pastures . He wiped the sweat from his brow and heard a single bee buzzing against the screen . Too damn quiet . He feared silence was going to have an unforeseen and unfortunate by-product . As he stood there , adrift in boxes and bare windows , the voice came again-the desperate voice of a miserably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . (
