Of course Washington is talking about Dick Cheney 's power . But like Leno and Letterman , the capital is also buzzing about his health . After all , the man has had four heart attacks , and though he 's only 5 1/2 years older than Dubya ( Cheney turned 60 last week ) , his physique is decidedly old school  --  more like former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's than our gym-addicted President 's . Does he have the stamina to be the most powerful Veep in history ? <P> He appears to be holding up well so far . Since suffering a mild heart attack in November , Cheney has been working out for half an hour every morning on a treadmill and an elliptical trainer  --  one part cross-country ski machine , one part stair climber . The Veep 's cardiologist , Jonathan Reiner , says Cheney is " doing great , doing all the right things , looking great . " That means sacrifice . Cheney , an able chef who is known for preparing grilled meats , beef stew and spaghetti  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bratwurst on the campaign trail  --  seems to have trimmed the fat from his diet . Cheney 's office says he no longer starts the day with a " Western-style breakfast . " Starbucks skim lattes are in , for both Dick and wife Lynne , when they can get them . During Inauguration week , the Cheneys barred chocolate , nuts and other fatty snacks from their Madison Hotel suite . And Cheney 's butcher told TIME that the Vice President has n't been coming by as often for his favorite cuts  --  porterhouse and rib-eye steaks . On his recent visits to the Someplace Special Giant Gourmet in McLean , Va. , says meat manager Tim Bowman , Cheney moseyed right past the meat counter . " I guess as soon as they say he can eat more , " says Bowman , " he 'll buy more . " <P> But even the mighty have their weaknesses . Back in December , at a postelection lunch at the Capitol , some Senators dined on chicken salad and melon . Cheney had fried chicken . <P>  --  By Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
