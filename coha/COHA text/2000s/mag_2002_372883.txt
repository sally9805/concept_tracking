Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman has vowed that he wo n't run for President in 2004 if Al Gore is a candidate . But Gore 's former running mate is acting a lot like a man looking for a promotion to the top of the ticket . This week alone he is set to make a round of fund-raising stops including Tacoma , Wash. , and Tucson , Ariz. ; will talk high tech in Silicon Valley and Latino issues in L.A. ; and will spend two days in New Hampshire . <P> But what is really winning Lieberman cheers among dispirited party activists is his new assertiveness in Washington . While other Democrats have been exercising caution in speaking against the policies of a popular President , Lieberman has launched a frontal assault . Last week he called for delaying major portions of the Bush tax cut ( prominent Democrats like Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt have criticized the tax cut but stopped short of taking action against it ) . The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , which Lieberman chairs , issued the first congressional subpoenas to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieberman critics say the move was long overdue ; it shook loose documents showing far more contacts than had been disclosed . <P> Lieberman 's committee also called the Administration on its political ace card  --  its handling of terrorism  --  by passing legislation that would put the Office of Homeland Security under congressional oversight . And Lieberman 's long-ignored proposal for a commission to investigate Sept. 11 became a rallying point for Democrats in the flood of revelations that the FBI had missed clues on terrorism . Within the party , all this seems to be playing well . In Arizona , an early 2004 primary state , Democratic spokeswoman Dianna Jennings says , " There 's a sense among party activists that what he 's doing on the 9/11 stuff is right on .
