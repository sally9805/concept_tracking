So how much has the FBI changed since Coleen Rowley 's searing memo ? FBI Director Robert Mueller has pushed to improve communication between field agents and officials at Washington headquarters and has encouraged information sharing with other government agencies , particularly the CIA . " The level of cooperation is much better , " says a U.S. intelligence official . The swapping of tips helped the FBI pull off two of the year 's biggest arrests : the capture of dirty-bomb suspect Jose Padilla in May and the September bust of five suspected al-Qaeda operatives in Lackawanna , N.Y . <P> But in other areas the FBI has done little to change its ways . Mueller has confounded some FBI insiders by promoting and decorating officials who held key leadership positions when the bureau missed warning signs in the months leading up to Sept. 11 . The FBI chief outraged congressional critics by citing Marion ( Spike ) Bowman  --  the head of the bureau 's National Security Law Unit , which refused to let the Minneapolis , Minn. , agents search Zacarias Moussaoui 's computer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( For his part , Bowman says that " I do n't think I did anything wrong here . In fact I know I did n't . " ) Mueller also named Pasquale D'Amuro , the counterterrorism chief in the FBI 's New York City office before Sept. 11 , to the bureau 's top counterterrorism post  --  dismaying critics who say that last year 's intelligence lapses demanded a management shake-up . " They have basically promoted the exact same people who have presided over the ... failure , " says a former Justice Department official , " and those individuals took the same thinking with them . " <P> The bureau pledged to upgrade its computer system , but a recent review by the Justice Department Inspector General dismissed the $458 million effort so far . " The FBI continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on I.T . projects without adequate assurance that these projects will meet their intended goals , " the report said . And Mueller 's attempts to bolster the bureau 's terrorism-fighting image , by hiring 1,000 new agents and creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindered by both the inconsistent training of new agents and the recalcitrance of older ones . " There are more chaos and morale problems at the FBI than there ever have been , " says a former senior law-enforcement official . " There are people walking around in distress . " <P> Faced with that stagnation , a federal commission investigating intelligence failures recommended last month that domestic counterterrorism responsibilities be taken away from the FBI and given to a proposed National Counter Terrorism Center . Says former Virginia Governor James Gilmore , who chaired the commission : " There is a sense that there needs to be a new agency . " Modeled on Britain 's domestic-security outfit , the MI5 , the agency would bring together counterterrorism specialists from the FBI , the CIA and other government agencies . The Bush Administration is studying the idea , but at least one government official has publicly denounced it : this month Mueller insisted that the FBI is " uniquely situated " to fight terrorists and said the creation of a new department would be " a step backward in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the argument , he needs to convince his critics that the FBI is moving ahead .  --  By Romesh Ratnesar and Timothy J.
