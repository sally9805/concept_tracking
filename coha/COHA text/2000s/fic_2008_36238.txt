Noise was one of the few things that moved freely inside a prison . The haunting echo of my own footsteps followed me down the long , windowless corridor inside the maximum security wing of Florida State Prison in Starke . I 'd visited many prisons , and the smell was always the same : a choking mixture of piss , shit , fear , and desperation , wiped down by harsh antiseptics . Walking through an electronically operated steel door , I was pat &shy; ted down by two stone-faced guards . Satis ? ed that I was not carry &shy; ing weapons or contraband , they passed me off to a smirking inmate with a hideous purple birthmark on the side of his face . He took off at a brisk pace , and I followed him into the cellblock that housed death row inmates . " What 's your name ? " I asked . " Garvin , " he replied , not breaking stride . " What are you in for ? " " I shot up my family during Thanksgiving dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to the ? oor , feel &shy; ing their occupants ' presence like a ? st pounding on my back . When we arrived at an empty cell , Garvin slid back the door , and stepped to one side . " Wait inside here , " he said . <br> " What if no one comes ? " I asked . <br> " Make some noise , and I 'll come get you . " <br> I entered the cell , a ten-by-ten concrete square with two wood benches anchored to the ? oor , and a small wood table . Garvin slammed the door behind me , making me jump . He chuckled as he walked away . <br> I took the bench nearest the door , and stuck a piece of gum into my mouth . I chewed so hard it made my jaw ache . I 'd put scores of bad guys into Starke , and I did n't want to be here any longer than I had to . <br> I stared at the table . Inmates were not supposed to have anything sharp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly epi &shy; thets were carved into every inch of wood . One name stood out over the others . <br> Abb Grimes <br> <br> I had been involved in Abb 's case , and I knew his story . A Fort Lauderdale native , he 'd quit high school at seventeen , done a stint in the navy , gotten married and had a kid , and gone to work driving a newspaper delivery truck  --  an ordinary guy , except that he liked to kill young women . <br> Abb 's killings followed a pattern . Late at night , he left his house , and walked to the neighborhood grocery . There , he 'd hidden behind the Dumpsters . When a young homeless woman would show up looking for food , he 'd drag her into the woods , rape and strangle her , then stuff her body in a large garbage bag , tossing her into a Dumpster . <br> As mass murders went , it was nearly perfect . The victims were women no one cared about , and the bodies were disposed of for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night a surveillance camera ? lmed Abb with the body of a victim draped in his arms . As was his custom , the store manager viewed the tape the next morn &shy; ing . Seeing Abb , he called 911 . <br> The police found the woman 's body in the Dumpster . They got a search warrant for Abb 's home and in his garage they found a card &shy; board box containing women 's underpants . Each of the pairs was different . <br> Their next stop was the Pompano Beach land ? ll , where trash in Broward County was taken . Using earth movers and cadaver dogs , they 'd moved several acres of trash , digging up the bodies of seven &shy; teen strangled women . <br> Eleven of the women were carrying ID . As head of the Broward County Sheriff 's Department 's Missing Persons unit , it had been my job to contact their families . It had been one of the hardest things I 'd ever done . <br> The remaining six women were still Jane Does . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories to rest . Only I 'd lost my job after beating up a suspect , and never gotten it done . <br> It ate at me . <br> Hearing footsteps , I went to the cell door . Wearing leg irons and handcuffs and ? anked by two guards , Abb shuf ? ed down the hall . Tall and powerfully built , he had an angular jaw and dark , deeply set eyes . During his trial , the prosecution had called him " The Night Stalker , " which had been a TV show that had lasted one season . It had scared the hell out of everyone who 'd seen it . The nickname ? t . <br> " Stand back , " a guard ordered . <br> I retreated , and the three men entered . Abb dropped down on the opposing bench and looked at the ? oor , while the two guards re &shy; mained standing . <br> An attractive brunette clutching a leather briefcase came in next . She was young and looked a little scared , and I found myself admir &shy; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter a prison ? lled with a thou &shy; sand hardened criminals . <br> " I 'm Piper Stone , Abb 's attorney , " she said . <br> " Jack Carpenter , " I said . <br> " Thank you for coming . " <br> We sat on the bench , and faced Abb . As strange as it sounded , he was my client , so I waited for him to start . Abb cleared his throat . He had a voice like gravel , and I guessed he did n't use it much . <br> " I 'm going to die soon , " Abb said . " Did my lawyer tell you that ? " <br> " No , she did n't , " I said . <br> " They 're going to execute me in four days , " Abb said . " Think you can ? nd my grandson before then ? " <br> Abb 's grandson , three-year-old Sampson Grimes , had disap &shy; peared from his bedroom three nights ago . I 'd read about it in the Fort Lauderdale newspapers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate him . <br> " I 'm going to try , " I said . " Now , why do n't you tell me what happened . " <br> " I get an hour each day to exercise in the yard , " Abb said . " Two days ago , a photograph of my grandson and a ransom note got slipped into my back pocket . I did n't see who did it . " <br> " Do you still have the note and photo ? " I asked . <br> " I gave them to Ms. Stone . " <br> I looked at Stone . " I 'd like to see them . " <br> Stone unclasped her briefcase and handed me the items . The photo showed a tow-headed little boy with a face like the Gerber baby lying on a blanket . His clothes looked clean , as did his face and hands , and his eyes showed no sign of fear . I took these as a sign that his captor was not abusing him . Lying on the blanket was a copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a trick used by kidnappers to show that their victims were still alive . <br> I shifted my attention to the ransom note . Written in pencil , it said , " Stop talking to the FBI or Sampson will die . " The handwriting surprised me . Most kidnappers used typewriters , or glued letters cut from a magazine . Whoever had kidnapped Sampson obviously did n't think he was going to get caught . <br> " What are you talking to the FBI about ? " I asked . <br> " I 'm in their VICAP program , " Abb said . " I was supposed to go under hypnosis to help them identify those Jane Does . I still do n't remember the things I did . " <br> VICAP was the FBI 's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program . Cops had an expression when criminals entered programs like VICAP , and agreed to help the police . They called it taking a shot at heaven . <br> " Does the FBI know you were contacted by your grandson 's kid &shy; napper ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about the police ? " I asked . <br> Abb shook his head again . <br> " Why have n't you told them ? " <br> " Because I want you to ? nd him , " Abb said . <br> " Why ? " I asked . <br> " I 've met six guys in Starke who are serving life for kidnapping lit &shy; tle kids . You put them here . That 's why . " <br> I slipped the ransom note into my pocket . <br> " You 're going to take the job ? " Abb asked . <br> " Yes , " I said . <br> " Good . " <br> I stood and so did Stone . She went over and placed her hand on Abb 's shoulder . Under her breath she said , " I 'll call you tomorrow , and let you know how the appeals are going . " <br> Abb gazed up at her and nodded . <br> One of the guards slid back the cell door . Stone and I started to leave . I saw Abb look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . I decided to level with him . <br> " Your grandson 's case is three days old , " I said . " That 's a long time when it comes to a kidnapping . I need to do a lot of groundwork , and talk to a lot of people . " <br> " What are you trying to say ? " Abb asked . <br> " I may not ? nd Sampson before they execute you . " <br> " Four days is n't enough ? " <br> " I wo n't know until I start looking . " <br> " I was hoping you  --  " <br> I cut him off . " I do n't make promises . " <br> " But  --  " <br> " That 's the deal , " I said . <br> Abb cast his eyes to the ? oor . He had asked me here because he did not want to go to his death knowing he 'd caused an innocent child to suffer . I had to think it was one of the more decent things he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he muttered . <br> He was still staring at the ? oor when we left . <br> Continues ...
