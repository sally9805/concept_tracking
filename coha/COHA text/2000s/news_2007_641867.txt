<p> As if the Bears ' season has n't been disappointing enough , out comes a new poll that ranks Soldier Field a lowly 20th out of the 32 NFL stadiums . Talk about piling on . <p> And the worst thing is , you ca n't argue with the survey results . At least I ca n't . Is Soldier Field really that bad ? Well , yes . It is . <p> This survey comes to us courtesy of SI.com , which rated " the fan experience that each NFL team offers based on some 17,000 fans ' opinions in seven categories . " The categories : tickets , food and souvenirs , accessibility , tailgating , caliber of team , stadium atmosphere and neighborhood . <p> Guess which stadium came out on top ? Lambeau Field , home of the Packers , of course . Ford Field , the Lions ' new home , ranked fourth . Of the NFC North teams , only the Vikings ' home monstrosity , the Metrodome , at No. 31 finished worse than Soldier Field . <p> Love or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives up to its hype . And I think we can all agree that the Metrodome is a horrible place to watch any sports event . I have n't been to Ford Field , so I 'll withhold judgment on that one . <p> But back to Soldier Field . You might have assumed it would score a big fat zero ( out of 10 ) for neighborhood , or at least a " not applicable , " because there are no neighborhoods near the stadium . But no , somehow it scored a 6 , based on suspect logic like this : " While there are n't many bars/restaurants in the immediate proximity , there are plenty within a reasonable walking distance . " I wonder why no one ever applies this rationale when they 're critiquing U.S. Cellular Field ? <p> A GOOD SPOT FOR A BRAT <p> Soldier Field received an 8 for tailgating , and although that 's a generous score  --  the new parking configuration ate up most of the best tailgating areas  --  I 'll concede this one . Although I 've never tailgated there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking barbecue , not booze  --  while walking through the lots . And who among us does n't love the smell of charred meats ? In case you 're wondering , though , Lambeau got a 10 . <p> Soldier Field received a 4 for accessibility , which leads me to believe the survey respondents have never actually tried to get to the stadium . I would have scored it lower . What is the best way to get to Soldier Field ? Parachuting ? Only a masochist would attempt to drive there without having a pre-assigned parking pass hanging from his or her rearview mirror . Without one , you might find yourself stuck on Lake Shore Drive forever , unable to exit . Or worse , you 'll be able to exit , but then will get stuck in the maze of going-nowhere-roads that surround the stadium . Worrying about missing the opening kickoff will soon become an afterthought as you concentrate on a more urgent concern : Could I get lost back here forever ? If you opt for a cab , be prepared to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's if you can find a cabbie willing to take you to the stadium . The drivers really hate sitting in that traffic , too . And anyone taking public transportation must either be prepared to walk forever to get to the front gates or figure out how to transfer to a bus , which will sit in traffic for an hour but will at least be warm . <p> If looks could kill <p> Esthetically speaking , most of us agree that the Soldier Field renovation was a disappointment , do n't we ? The futuristic-looking glass mixed with the old-school colonnades just does n't look right . This comment from a survey-taker would seem to sum up our feelings : " Whoever designed it might know modern architecture , but they understand nothing about Chicago . " Yet other respondents spoke about " phenomenal sight lines " and " comfortable and spacious seats . " And I guess the others won out , as the stadium scored an 8 in the atmosphere category . Again , a generous score . <p> While noting that games have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rabid , " Soldier Field scored only 5 for tickets . Why ? Maybe because the average ticket price is $84.89 , compared to $63.39 at Lambeau , $59.09 at Ford Field and $70.91 at the Metrodome . Similarly , Soldier Field scored a 6 for food and souvenirs , which I suspect has more to do with pricey souvenirs than the taste of the hot dogs . At $20 , a Bears cap at Soldier Field costs more than a Lions cap at Ford Field ( $18 ) , a Vikings cap at the Metrodome ( $15 ) or a Packers cap at Lambeau ( $12.95 ) . It costs a lot to be a Bears fan . <p> Of course , your money seems better , and your Soldier Field experience more rewarding , when the Bears are winning . And so we come to the team itself . The Bears scored a 3 out of 10  --  one point for each win ?  --  with Brian Urlacher and Devin Hester being named as players worth watching . Contrast that with , say , the New England Patriots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth watching , led by Tom Brady and Randy Moss . The Packers scored a 9 , and they have Brett Favre . <p> Like I said , it 's tough to argue with the results of this survey . Especially the bottom line , per SI.com : " Lucky for the Bears , the place the team holds in the city 's heart will keep the turnstiles spinning ...
