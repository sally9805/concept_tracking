The Killer Elite Vengeance is mined in Steven Spielberg 's taut , dazzling historical thriller Munich . by Owen Gleiberman Eric Sana , Daniel Craig , Geoffrey Rush , Ciarn Hinds R , 167 mins . ( Universal ) The thriller is a gloriously amoral form . We might be watching a heist artist , a cop , or an ice-blooded sniper-what counts , before anything , is the deftness of the action , the ruthless pleasure of pulse-pounding risk and reward . Munich , Steven Spielberg 's spectacularly gripping and unsettling new movie , is a grave and haunted film , yet its power lies in its willingness to be a work of brutal excitement . It 's a movie about killing that invites the audience to share the terror and the rush , the adrenaline of vengeance , only to leave us sliding into the horror on the other side . Munich hegins with an event that shook the world , and that arguably remade it : the taking of 11 Israeli athletes as hostages by Palestinian terrorists during the 1972 Olympic Games , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cataclysm as a dread-ridden collage of TV broadcasts being watched by viewers around the globe . The famous , eerie shot of a ski-masked terrorist leaning over a balcony is made all the eerier when Spielberg stages it from within the hostage quarters , in perfect simultaneity with the hazy vintage TV footage . In Munich , however , the Olympic massacre gets relatively little screen time . Inside the walls of Israeli power , the prime minister , Golda Meir ( Lynn Cohen ) , gives terse approval to a new eye-for-an-eye ethos : For the sake of Israel 's strength and survival , she says , the men who planned the Munich terror must be hunted down and killed . Spielberg , working from a script by the playwright Tony Kushner and Eric Roth , follows a team of five assassins whose mission of vengeance , organized by the dour , pragmatic Ephraim ( played with a jaunty misanthropic jolt by Geoffrey Rush ) , is to be kept secret even within the Israeli intelligence agency the Mossad . Since that mission has remained secret ever since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The team leader , Avner ( Eric Bana ) , is tall , strapping , and ironically gentle . The son of an Israeli war hero , he 's a tender husband who 's about to have a baby he will scarcely see for the next two years , yet despite his cherubic poker face , he has the hint of a bruiser about him . His comrades , mostly European Jews , are a quirkier lot . They include a hotheaded South African getaway driver named Steve ( Daniel Craig ) ; an antiques aficionado , Hans ( Hanns Ziaehler ) , with a flair for forging documents : Carl ( Ciarn Hinds ) , a jovial and with his fedora and tortoiseshell glasses , has the air of an insurance salesman out of a ' ' 50s film noir ; and Robert ( Mathieu Kassovitz ) , a nervous young Belgian toy maker-turned-bomb maker explosives quite right . Kushner has written these hostile spunk . There 's a glimmer of fractious comedy in this team of not-too-macho Jewish hitmen , who quibble , with Talmudic precision , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodyguard with a gun count as a civilian ? ( They ca n't kill him if he does . ) At moments , the film plays like a cross between The French Connection and some ' ' 70s crime-series pilot-The Matzah Squad . Yet Munich , through the unromantie oddity of its assassins , does something all too rare : It immerses us in a suspense that 's logistical and , at the same time , anxiously humane . These agents have tittle high technology to hide behind , and their schemes , most of which hinge on plasticexplosive bombs detonated by remote switch , play out without the usual glib overkill . We ca n't predict what 's going to happen any more than they can . In the Paris apartment of a terrorist-schoiar , the phone is stuffed with explosives , but when his young daughter enters the flat , the scramble to abort the mission has a Hitchcockian intensity . Spielberg shoots Munich without showy virtuosity , yet his at once , and John Williams ' score is like a telltale heartbeat . The result is a thriller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination , things go awry in a different way . A too-potent bomb blows up an entire hotel floor , almost killing Avner , and the no-civilian rule begins to get left in shards . As acts of global terrorism escalate , a malaise sets in : Righteous as they are , for Israel accomplishing ? Are they even killing the right men ? In the role of Louis , the French information dealer from whom Avner buys the names of his targets ( at hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop ) , Mathieu Amalric , crocodile grin , incarnates the sleaze of " neutrality . " The very sight of him signifies the gray Bone that Avner has entered . Eric Bana , with wavy hair and a puckered grin that makes him look like Jim Carrey 's Andy Kaufman , exudes a decency that is undercut by ripples of anguish . Yet as Avner 's willingness to kill for Israel shades into paranoid futility , there 's one sequence that sputters : Spielberg cuts between Avneijs tormented sexual union with his wife and a flashback to the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the spark plug of vengeance that Avner has moved beyond . That , however , is the only misstep in a movie that has the vision to dramatize a startling reality : that political murder , even when it 's justified , consumes the soul-and justice along with it .
