<p> NO ROOM FOR 5,000 HAITIAN ELIANS <p> Editor  --  I would like to thank you for the insightful article , " No Room for 5,000 Elians " ( Chronicle , April 3 ) . Nowhere else have I read such a clear and thoughtful presentation of a problem which America has chosen to ignore at this critical time . So much media coverage and heart-wringing emotionalism about an " orphaned child " ( who is not an orphan at all ) has been generated and is misplaced . To consider the bare facts and the fate of one child while ignoring the fates of thousands of other helpless children seems totally inappropriate . <p> Where is our sense of indignation ? Why have we chosen to ignore this grievous problem , existent for so many years ? When boats of escaping Haitians are caught , they are turned back or seized and burned , because they , too , seek a " better life " in the United States of America . Thousands have drowned . They had no passports or fake passports . Would those people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No one discussed the fact that they would have been illegal entrants in this country . Yet we would change the law to keep this one child and persecute/prosecute thousands of other children and their parents for seeking the same asylum . Is this the way we treat our refugees or only those of a certain hue ? <p> If changes be made to help Elian , why not extend amnesty to the parents of the children who came from Haiti on fake passports ? The children , born in America , have committed no crime . Why should they , as citizens , be sent to Haiti , where they have never lived ? There needs to be a reasonable alternative . <p> Thank you for posing the problem . All of us need to try to find answers and force our representatives in the Congress to resolve the dilemma in a fair and humane manner . <p> RENA MERRITT BANCROFT <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE FOURTH BRANCH <p> Editor  --  In a presidential election year where the economy is doing very well ( at least so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates are failing to confront an important question : Why does the Federal Reserve have the power to readily raise interest rates and tamper with the greatest economic expansion in this country 's history ? <p> Their failure to do so bears witness to the cowardice and hypocrisy of our politicians , particularly Gov . George W. Bush . Conservative Republicans consistently preach against government interference in the economy , yet none of them seem troubled by a government body ( and , most of all , an unelected and unaccountable one ) having influence and control over the nation 's economy . This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue ; it is a constitutional one . The Federal Reserve almost operates as if it were a fourth branch of government , yet it is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution of the United States . <p> STEVEN KUROIWA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> MONUMENTAL PROBLEM ' <p> Editor  --  The Sequoia National Monument " issue " is rife with untold behind-the-scenes shenanigans . Sierra Pacific Industries ( SPI ) is the largest buyer of timber on California 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the logs sold by the Forest Service . With 1.5 million acres , SPI is the second largest private landowner in the nation . <p> If big timber companies had n't bought up so many smaller companies ( like Glen Duysen 's , featured in your article ) and paid off their debt  --  by unprecedented increases in destruction of their acquired forests , by 86 percent since 1995 , and from 5,000 acres in ' 95 to 25,000 in ' 99  --  maybe a monument would n't seem so urgent . <p> Why do n't you feature that story on your front page ? That 's the " monumental problem , " not Clinton 's sane proposal to try to slow down some of the rampant destruction . Under the Quincy Library Group Plan , logging of 60,000 acres of three Northern California national forests is allowed each year ! Where is that going to lead ? How do you replace 60,000 acres a year ? How about some perspective here ? <p> GAYLE DOUB <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CLEAR-CUT DAMAGES <p> Editor  --  April 12 meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bragg , Calif . There are several hundred of us who attend meetings of this order . We generally belong to groups such as the Big River Watershed or the Jackson Forest Restoration Campaign . <p> The 50,000-plus acres involved contain several rivers and hundreds of streams , each of which will be grossly affected by a plan for clear-cut logging in the area . We represent tens of thousands of citizens who will be affected by this horrific practice . Hundreds of thousands of additional coastline acres and villages will suffer , not only from herbicides but from the final-final on trout , steelhead , cod and abalone , as well as many other creatures . <p> Winters already find the rivers brown with mud well into the ocean . Those of us who have seen these rivers and their streams and bays for the past 35 years know this to be true . We are all downstream from the clear-cut . <p> We sincerely hope Mr. Roger Thompson , as deputy chief of California Forest Practices , will keep the loggers out of our neighborhoods . <p> JOHN RUTHERFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  In response to the jury 's unanimous decision on March 30 for Dr. Colleen Crangle against Stanford University on charges of retaliation , attorneys for the university have embarked on a vigorous spin campaign . They want people to believe that there was no gender discrimination . However , these are the facts . The very first question the jury had to answer was : Did Dr. Crangle make a good-faith claim of gender discrimination ? If her claim had been spurious , the jury would have had to answer " No , " and that would have been the end of their deliberations . But , in fact , they answered " Yes , " and went on to find that Stanford had then retaliated against Dr. Crangle , acting with malice or reckless disregard for her protected rights . <p> The jury verdict form has been scanned in and made available for everyone to read at www.gender-equity.org . I urge your readers to take a look for themselves and reach their own conclusions on the verdict , just as the jury of eight women and men did on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the community would be better served if Stanford were to accept the jury 's decision with grace , and focus not on a campaign of spin , but on a campaign of change . <p> The American Association of University Women Legal Advocacy Fund provided support for Dr. Crangle in her legal battle . The 150,000 members of the AAUW have a message for Stanford : We are watching to see if and when there will be equity for women on your campus . <p> GLORIA WESTON <p> Vice President <p> AAUW California <p> Legal Advocacy Fund <p> Orinda <p> . <p> $10 GAS FOR YUPPIES <p> Editor  --  Perhaps it is the enhanced elevation of the driving seats of those big SUVs , but it is clear that a lot of people in San Francisco have a very skewed sense of proportion when it comes to complaining about paying only $2 per gallon for gas . Statistics show that between 1982 and 1999 , the average price of gasoline rose by 7 percent , compared with a 71 percent increase in the general inflation rate over the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $7-to-$10 per gallon range , and in line with European prices . In fact , I look forward to the day that gas does reach that price , since not only will it solve many of our environmental problems , but it will provide an answer to that timeless question : " How many Bernese Mountain Dogs and Macintosh G4 PowerMacs can a yuppie fit into a Chevy Metro , anyway ?

A triple threat ! <p> CHUCK KNAPP <p> San Francisco
