<p> BREAUX BRIDGE , La. - The good folks down in these parts will have you know dealing with celebrity is n't some sort of nouveau experience . <p> Ali Landry , Miss USA 1996 and sure to be seen in a corn chip commercial any minute now , is a native , as is rookie Domanick Davis , who this past NFL season became the first player to rush for 1,000 yards with the second-year expansion Houston Texans . <p> There also are the three members of the LSU Tigers , who celebrated their share of college football 's national championship in a purple and gold- tinged parade that snaked through the streets of nearby Baton Rouge this past weekend . <p> But that quintet is like first-day contestants on ' American Idol ' compared to Jake Delhomme , another native son who will carry the hopes and dreams of the town 's 7,360 residents Sunday when he quarterbacks the Carolina Panthers against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII . <p> ' I 'm 61 years old ; I started playing sports in the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , ' Breaux Bridge Mayor Jack Dale Delhomme said . ' Do you know how many titles and Super Bowls I 've won ? I 've never missed a game-winning shot in my backyard . I 've won every national championship I 've played . <p> ' Watching Jake makes me feel like it 's me out there , and I think in this small town , a lot of the men feel that . And the women here are thinking , ' That could be my son - my daughter could be married to this guy . ' He 's one of ours . ' <p> The mayor , a cousin of the quarterback 's , is hoping to use his connection to Delhomme for a political photo-op this spring that would put Patriots signal-caller Tom Brady 's excursion to Washington for last week 's State of the Union Address to shame - acting as the grand marshal of the town 's annual Crawfish Festival . <p> That is no small honor around here . Outside City Hall is a plaque stating Breaux Bridge was founded in 1859 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preparation of crawfish . ' Atop a rickety bridge that leads to the town center , there 's a weather-beaten mural depicting the buggy-looking fish set against a waving American flag . <p> The gastronomic pleasures derived from eating the little bottom-feeder is one reason the town calls itself the ' crawfish capital of the world ' - which is why Jake Delhomme ca n't understand all the fuss being made of his ' small town ' background . <p> ' Come on , it 's a capital of the world , ' he told reporters , tongue firmly planted in cheek , before the Panthers ' 14-3 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC championship game . <p> Life in a fishbowl <p> Delhomme could come to the festival as the proud possessor of a Super Bowl championship ring , should Carolina beat New England at Reliant Stadium in Houston , but chances are the locals would have to plead for him to show off the bejeweled bauble . Such an ostentatious display would belie who he is and where he 's from . <p> On Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etouffee , Delhomme 's older brother , Jeff , could be found at a local car dealership , not signing autographs or holding court about his sibling 's exploits , but rather painting the windowsills and trim around the building . <p> ' I 've only done about 15 hours of work this week , ' Jeff said before asking a manager 's permission to sit in one of the dealership 's offices to chat . ' Jake calls up and asks what I 'm doing , and I tell him I have two people in line , someone on the phone and someone else on call waiting , and he just laughs . ' <p> The joke is both men realize that , had Jake not helped author the Panthers ' surprising run to Houston , chances are he would have been right beside Jeff at Martin Chevy , paintbrush in hand . It 's just how it is in Breaux Bridge , the place where Jake began dating his wife , Keri , in the seventh grade and where residents will sometimes pull up in their cars to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stop mowing the lawn or feeding the horses to accommodate them . <p> Such civility is why , try as they might to maintain a semblance of their normal lives , someone in the De- <p> lhomme family will take a few moments to deal with the intruders who have descended upon the community in the wake of Carolina 's success . <p> After the Panthers beat the Eagles , one of the first calls Jake got was from St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt War- <p> ner . The two share the same agent , and Warner wanted to give Delhomme a heads-up on what to expect in the buildup to the Super Bowl . Jake , in turn , called the mayor , asking him to serve as his unofficial press agent and ambassador to Breaux Bridge . <p> The fear amongst the family , Jack Dale said , is the town and the people will be besmirched . <p> ' We 're educated people down here , ' he said . ' We can write complete sentences ; we drive cars and wear shoes . ' <p> Breaux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow . Ever the politician , the mayor says the burg , which has a tourism and promotions budget of about $ 30,000 , has received about $ 1 million in publicity because of the Panthers and Delhomme 's run . <p> ' We take pride in our cuisine . We have the best food in the world , ' he said . ' Ca n't beat our cookin ' . Go anywhere and eat and see for yourself . But now we have Jake . I told the chamber of commerce , ' Do you know what this boy has done for us ? " <p> ' It 's just so weird to look up at a television and see him being interviewed . It 's like , ' I went to school with that guy , " said Faith Ogle , who , along with Delhomme , was part of a 40-person graduating class at Teurlings Catholic High . ' But he deserves it . He 's so sweet ; his wife is so sweet . Both of their families are so sweet . It 's almost too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden fame almost certainly will be quite fleeting . <p> According to Jeff , after a recent interview with a Houston television station , his parents were offered a chance to tour the facilities after the big-game hubbub had died down . Jerry and Marcia Delhomme accepted the invitation with a grain of salt . <p> ' Dad said , ' Who are they kidding ? Two weeks from now , they wo n't even know who we are . " <p> Admirals to Saints , Panthers <p> Actually , if one were looking for someone to play the part of a ' Super Bowl quarterback ' with all the glamorous trappings that might entail , a better choice would be Delhomme 's backup , Rodney Peete . <p> A 15-year veteran in the NFL , Peete is married to actress Holly Robinson , and his swagger in the Panthers ' locker room and the esteem in which he 's held would fit a casting director 's vision more than Delhomme , a perennial backup throughout his professional career . That includes NFL Europe , where he played behind Warner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who anointed Aaron Brooks as their quarterback of the future . <p> Although he had some successes in his brief appearances in the Bayou , it was clear Delhomme would have to leave the state if he wanted a real chance to play . And that was the main consideration when he went looking for a team as a free agent in the 2002 offseason . So while there was a temptation to join the Dallas Cowboys , and legendary coach Bill Parcells , there was little question where Delhomme would end up . <p> ' At the end of the day , it really was n't much of a decision , ' said Rick Smith , Delhomme 's agent . <p> ' Dallas was more , ' We 'll throw you in the mix and see what happens . ' The Panthers made it clear there would be more than an equal opportunity for Jake to play . ' <p> Delhomme signed a two-year contract worth $ 4 million , but when the season began he was a backup again , this time to Peete . That changed at halftime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina from a 17-0 deficit to beat Jacksonville . <p> Although his numbers - 3,219 yards passing , 19 touchdowns and 16 interceptions - would n't rival Peyton Manning 's , it was clear that the Panthers , 1-15 just two years ago and 7-9 last season , were responding to Delhomme 's leadership . <p> ' ( Panthers coach ) John Fox says he looked in Jake 's eyes and he knew that Jake had ' it , " Jack Dale said . ' Well , what is ' it ' - we all knew that Jake had ' it . ' Our people , our culture has a passion to succeed and do well . Even when we 're cooking there 's passion . ' <p> Jack Dale says he has a surly side Jake does n't have . Jake does n't get riled up by a negative comment thrown in his direction . <p> ' Jake just lets it go over his head , he just keeps going , he stays focused , ' Jack Dale said . ' But sometimes when he gets it going , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away from people like that . " <p> Waiting by the phone <p> That intensity , and the confidence that goes along with it , has the mayor of Breaux Bridge wondering if his cousin will give him a call sometime this week . Delhomme , concerned for his family members ' safety in the big city , told them not to worry about coming to Philadelphia for the NFC championship game . Delhomme told them to just make their reservations for Houston because the Panthers were sure to pull off the upset of the Eagles . <p> ' Last year , Jake was the guest speaker at the chamber of commerce banquet , ' Jack Dale said , ' And Jake goes , ' You know , I 'd really like to come back again next year , but make sure you schedule it after the Super Bowl . " <p> Whether because of the city coffers - or the Panthers ' ticket allotment - Jack Dale wo n't be in Houston this weekend . As has been the case throughout the season , even when Delhomme 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , the mayor will get the key to their house and watch the Super Bowl from his designated chair , the better to sustain the karma that has carried Delhomme - and everyone else in his hometown - on such a giddy ride . <p> " Everybody in town in Breaux Bridge will be having a barbecue , then they 'll all go into the house to watch the game and just start calling each other , " Jack Dale said . " It 's going to be a great , great night . "
