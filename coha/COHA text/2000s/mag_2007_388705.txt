Headnote From staffing a remote island lighthouse to forging trails and even tracking moose , volunteer opportunities in the national parks are as varied as the parks themselves . It did not look good . A stiff westerly wind was raking the blue-black waters of Lake Superior into a frenzy . Skyrockets of spray careened off the bow of the National Park Service boat Plover . Landing at the Michigan Island Lighthouse would be dicey , but Karen Halbersleban is not one to back down from a challenge . President of Northland College , she had chosen a sabbatical in favor of a raise during her last contract negotiations , precisely so that she could make this dream come true . A few waves were not going to stop her now . " The captain looked at me and could see the fierce light in my eye , " she says . He knew they had to try . Following a skillful dance of boatmanship in the wind and waves , the vessel nosed up to the dock long enough for one passenger to disembark . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick goodbyes , and pushed away in a matter of moments . Just that quickly Karen Halbersleban was alone on an island , about to fulfill a dream that began three years earlier when she first learned of the unique volunteer program at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin . For the next month , she would no longer be known as " President Halbersleban " but as " keeper of the light . " As Halbersleban climbed the steps up the tower of the Michigan Island Light that day , she joined not only a long line of keepers at the 150-year-old lighthouse but an even longer line of volunteers who give freely of their time and talents each year in our national parks . The VIP ( Volunteers-In-Parks ) program is one of the largest and most successful volunteer programs in the nation . Begun in 1970 , it has become a juggernaut of goodwill and helping hands . Last year alone , the VIP program coordinated the efforts of 137,000 volunteers who logged 5.2 million hours of service in 365 areas managed by the National Park Service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks themselves . Volunteers run the annual butterfly count in Congaree National Park in South Carolina and inventory Kemp 's Ridley sea turtle hatchlings at Padre Island National Seashore in Texas . Last year volunteers helped Alaska 's Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve enter its first-ever float in the local Fourth of July Parade . And they lit more than 8,000 luminaries at what is now Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Site , one for each Mexican and American soldier who fought in a string of 1864 battles along the Rio Grande . In some national parks , you see the work of volunteers by looking up : Volunteers helped release 13 California condors to the skies over Pinnacles National Monument this year , and every year they turn more than 27,000 pairs of eyes to the heavens above Utah 's Bryce Canyon during stargazing programs . In other parks , their efforts are most evident by looking down : Volunteers at Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky helped facilitate the largest " mock cave rescue " in park history last year , and volunteers in Nevada aided in the reintroduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basin National Park . In a time when the Park Service is operating with an $800 million annual budget shortfall , VIPs in their green uniforms and " Volunteer " patches have become nearly as visible as the rangers themselves . Last year , volunteers in Badlands National Park in South Dakota led 40 percent of the interpretive programs and made 60 percent of the visitor contacts . " Volunteers have become absolutely vital to our park , " says Babette Collavo , who oversees the Great Smoky Mountains ' volunteer program , the third largest in the nation . " Last year alone , our program provided services equivalent to the hiring of 56 permanent staff . They are filling gaps that otherwise simply would n't get filled . " They are retirees and ranchers , scientists and schoolteachers . They are college presidents and college students . Each summer , the Student Conservation Association , now in its 50th year , deploys nearly 3,000 volunteers to parks , forests , and refuges all over the country . These crews of six to eight high school and college students cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , donating 1.6 million hours-much of them in national parks . Many VIPs , like Karen Halbersleban , are area residents who volunteer to become more familiar with nearby parks . For others , the journey is considerably longer . Last year the International VIP program placed 117 volunteers from 34 countries in 43 U.S. national parks-people like Patrick ) Bustos , a veterinary science student from Chile who spent five months in Rocky Mountain National Park tracking mountain lions and helping with bear monitoring projects . Bob Krumenaker , the superintendent of Apostle Islands National Lakeshore , who himself began his career as a park volunteer , understands the motivation many volunteers feel . " Parks represent motherhood and apple pie for many people , " he says , " the " best idea America ever had , " as Wallace Stegner said . And , as corny as this may sound , public service still resonates with people in this country . Volunteering in a beautiful , historic place gives them a chance to give something back and add depth to their relationship with the parks . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant combining volunteering and vacation . " Stomping through the thick woods with a backpack full of 40 pounds of moose bones may seem like a strange vacation to some , " says Dr. Rolf Peterson , " but there are people who come back every single year . " Over the past 19 years , nearly 500 Earthwatch volunteers have participated in Peterson 's classic wolf-moose study on Isle Royale National Park , ponying up $950 and paying their own travel expenses for the privilege of scouring the island and collecting moose bones for analysis . " It is the hardest work many of them have ever done , " Peterson says , but there are paybacks . " This spring we hiked 42 miles and never set foot on a trail . These volunteers get a view of Isle Royale that most hikers could only dream of . " And sometimes they are rewarded with close-up views of wolves , too . " Two years ago , an Earthwatch volunteer got a fullframe photograph of a wolf peeking into the flap of his tent , " says Peterson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered by national park volunteers in the most recent fiscal year at $91,260,000 . But for the volunteers themselves , it goes far beyond monetary value . Dick Marin volunteers with the Elk Bugle Corps in Rocky Mountain National Park during the September rutting season , when huge bull elk arrive en masse , followed by countless tourists ; volunteers educate the public , keep them at a safe distance , and enjoy the elk themselves . " To be alone in a remote part of the park , surrounded by elk and see the moon rise over the Rocky Mountains on a warm fall night-I wish everyone , once in their lifetime , could be where I was that night . " How do you put a decimal point on a face-to-face encounter with a wolf or tally up the value of a moonrise ? How do you put dollar signs on the view from the top of the 112-foot tower at the Michigan Island Light ? " That became my favorite spot , " says Halbersleban , the college president-turned-keeper . " It was the place I felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today in Apostle Islands National Lakeshore , the lights are all automated . The Michigan Island light snaps on at dusk and off at dawn with the aid of solar-powered timing devices . There is no coal to haul for the steampowered foghorns that once bellowed from some of the Apostle 's seven lights , no wicks to trim ( a task that earned keepers the nickname " wickies " ) . Still , the days of a volunteer keeper fall into a natural rhythm like the keepers of the past , a cadence set by chores and visitors , the needs of the light , and the realities of the living conditions . " As my life slowed into nature 's rhythm , " Halberslaben says , " I rediscovered the joys of being unplugged . With no electric lights , I found myself going to bed when it got dark and getting up with the sun . " There was , however , grass to mow , trails to keep clear , and an inquisitive black bear to shoo away from interpretive signs . But the real work began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols of these islands for most visitors , " says Superintendent Krumenaker . " Without access to a lighthouse , their experience here would be much different , and , frankly , without the help of volunteers who now occupy all but one of the lighthouses where we have staffing , it would simply not be possible to provide the opportunities that we do . " For a teacher with a Ph.D . in history , weaving the stories of the lighthouses and their keepers came easily . Halberslaben gave 99 tours to a total of 495 visitors during her stint . One , in particular , she remembers quite vividly . " There was a very elderly woman on the tour boat one day who was determined to get up the tower , " she recalls . " It must have taken her 20 minutes just to climb the 139 steps to the lighthouse station . Then she was faced with another 110 steps to the top of the tower . I remember asking her , " Are you sure you 're up to this ? ' But she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands and knees at times , the woman made it to the top , with the keeper 's help . " When I asked her why she wanted to do this so badly , she told me that she had planned to do it with her husband before his recent death , and that she was doing it for both of them , " Halbersleban says . " That was a moment I really felt like my presence made a difference . " When the tour boats left at the end of each day , Halbersleban took a water bottle , her radio , and a canvas chair to her favorite spot atop the tower . All alone , living out a dream on an island , she watched the sun set over Lake Superior until it was dark enough to see the lighthouse beam . " That beam became a kind of symbol for me , " she says , " a light shining out into the darkness . It 's what I think education is all about . " And it 's not a bad symbol for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our national parks , a light shining bright and gleaming out into the world .
