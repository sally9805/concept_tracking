Ghassan ( Gus ) Karim 's daughter was on the phone . Karim is a tailor who immigrated to the U.S. from Lebanon in 1969 . Thirty-two years later , when George W. Bush took the oath of office as President , he was wearing a suit made by his friend Gus . But after last week 's bombings , Karim 's daughter , who works for a Dallas financial-consulting company , called in tears . She had been taunted . " You were born in this country . Do n't worry about it , " Karim told her . A Muslim , a Rotarian and an American success story , he says , " This is my home , and I am proud to be here . I will never forget what this country gave me . " <P> Islam may be America 's fastest-growing faith . The country 's 7 million Muslims are overwhelmingly middle and professional class : a handful of autoworkers , many more small-business owners , lots of doctors and , increasingly , university professors . There are very few poor among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Professor John Esposito , head of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University , " it 's remarkable how fast they are making it up the ladder . And the next generation is expected to do better . " They are social conservatives : more than 65% voted for George W. Bush . They are pro-gun control , pro-environment and pro-death penalty . They are proud of their country . And they are viscerally  --  indeed , theologically  --  antiterrorist . One of the first clerics to speak at the service at the National Cathedral last week was Imam Muzammil H. Siddiqi : " We see the evil of destruction and the suffering of many of the people before our eyes . With broken and humble hearts and with tears in our eyes we turn to you , O Lord . " <P> Like Judaism and Christianity , its close religious relatives , Islam honors all humanity  --  not just believers  --  as created by God , who is referred to as " the compassionate and merciful . " The Judeo-Christian respect for the widow and the orphan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orphan , notes Georgetown 's John O. Voll . And for all the conflict depicted in the Koran , its recognition of pluralism is embodied in a verse that explains that God created humans different from one another so that they can learn from one another . <P> Amid the carnage of the Middle East , some clerics are providing young men with religious rationales for slaughter . But they are the anomaly in the global embrace of the faith . The leaders of Islamic America describe such reasoning as worse than a minority opinion  --  in fact , a kind of perversion . Sheik Taha Jabir Alalwani , president of the Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences , has this to say of the Twin Tower terrorists : " If they claim they are Muslim , I would say they are not . "
