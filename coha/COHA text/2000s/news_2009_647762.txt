The US Supreme Court divided into sharply defined liberal and conservative wings on Wednesday as the high court heard argument in a case involving allegations of reverse discrimination against white firefighters in New Haven , Conn . <p> As in most highly divisive issues at the high court , the outcome of the case may ultimately depend on the views of Justice Anthony Kennedy . During the 70-minute oral argument Wednesday , Justice Kennedy seemed troubled by the city 's decision to throw out all results of a promotion exam only after officials learned that no African-American candidates had scored high enough to be promoted . <p> " The city looked at the results , and it classified the successful and unsuccessful applicants by race , " Kennedy told Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler . " And you want us to say this is n't using race to decide ... I have trouble with this argument . " <p> In the past Kennedy has expressed distrust of the use of race as a criterion for government decisions and benefits , but he has also been reluctant to embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case is significant because it lies at the intersection of two important provisions of antidiscrimination law and could provide further clarity to employers seeking to avoid potential discrimination lawsuits . <p> It focuses on a test given in 2003 to firefighters seeking promotion to lieutenant and captain . When the city determined that no African-American candidates qualified for a promotion it threw out the results . White and Hispanic firefighters who did qualify called it illegal discrimination and filed a lawsuit . <p> The city says it threw out the test in an effort to comply with civil rights laws , not violate them . New Haven officials said they were worried that if they relied on the results of the test and promoted the white firefighters , the city might be vulnerable to a lawsuit by black firefighters claiming that the test caused an illegal " disparate impact " against minority job candidates . <p> At issue in Ricci v. DeStafano is whether the city acted properly in throwing out the exam results , or whether city officials should have followed its civil-service rules and awarded the promotions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The case revolves around Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , which requires that job candidates and employees be treated equally without regard to race or ethnicity . <p> But it is frequently difficult to prove that an employer is engaged in intentional discrimination . For this reason , Congress has also empowered victims of discrimination to sue in instances when an employment practice results in a disparate impact against members of a protected minority group . <p> Ricci v. DeStefano involves both sides of Title VII . The white and Hispanic firefighters are suing for what they say is intentional discrimination by the city , while the city justifies its decision to throw out the test results on grounds that it was only seeking to prevent a violation of the disparate impact side of Title VII . <p> Justice Antonin Scalia said that the two provisions seem to be " at war with one another . " <p> Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler and New Haven 's lawyer , Christopher Meade , said the law works toward a common goal . <p> The disparate impact section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is designed to encourage employers to self-police their employment practices by halting and correcting any practice that might result in a disparate impact against minority workers , he said . <p> The justices were divided over whether the completed employment test should have been so easily discarded . <p> " Should n't there be some standard that there has to be a significant - a strong showing after the test has been taken that it 's deficient ... before it can be set aside ? " Kennedy asked . <p> Kneedler responded that the Obama administration did not believe such a high showing was necessary because the city invalidated the test results for all candidates , not simply the white candidates . The government viewed the blanket invalidation as racially neutral . <p> Several conservative members of the court took issue with that view . Chief Justice John Roberts said New Haven 's position , if adopted , would create a " blank check to discriminate " against white employees . <p> One recurring issue during the argument was whether employees who pass a promotion test are entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal law creates a presumption that such employment tests should not be easily dismissed . <p> Mr. Meade disagreed . " Just because a test has been administered does n't mean that Title VII 's disparate impact provisions suddenly disappear , " he said . " There 's no entitlement to be promoted on the basis of a flawed or discriminatory test . " <p> Meade said the alternative would be to force employers to make workplace decisions based on a suspect test . " It 's much better for an employer to stop , " he said , " rather than to rush forward and to create potentially further discrimination and a more aggressive use of race down the road . " <p> Arguing from the liberal side of the court , Justice David Souter took issue with the firefighters approach to the case . <p> " The problem I have with your argument is that it leaves a governmental body like New Haven in a damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-do n't situation , " Justice Souter said . Either the city gets sued by the white firefighters , or it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever Congress wanted to attain in passing Title VII , it could n't have wanted to attain that kind of a situation . " <p> The firefighters lawyer , Gregory Coleman , told the justices that the city threw his client 's high-ranking test scores out based on a mere " good faith belief " that the city might be sued . He said the city should have to demonstrate more to justify the adverse action against his clients . <p> " Our firefighters had already taken the test ; they had earned their promotions under state law , " he said . <p> A decision in the case is expected by late June . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
