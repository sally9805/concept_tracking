Photograph The Rev. Al Sharpton , who was known as " the Wonder Boy Preacher " at age 9 ( left ) , has grown up to become an internationally recoginzed civil rights and human rights activist . At the Lincoln Memorial ( above ) , he speaks to thounsands who participated in the " Redeem Program " march in Washington , D.C. to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington . // THERE is modern-day slavery taking place in Africa , " the Rev. Al Sharpton said as he held a press conference on the steps of the U.S. State Department in Washington , D.C. , after briefing government officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firsthand the buying and selling of humans into chattel slavery . " It is incumbent upon us to make this issue one of global proportions that can not be ignored . " It did n't seem to matter to Sharpton that there were only three reporters on hand as he analyzed global issues with the flair , foresight and fortitude of great civil rights leaders of the past . It did n't seem to bother him that the gaggles of media that used to mob him on New York City streets-back when he spoon-fed shocking soundbites about the latest case of police brutality to anyone who would listen-had passed on reporting about his push to expose a shocking international crime . It did n't seem to upset the boisterous , sometimes raw , Harlem activist , who used to sport a sweatsuit and gaudy gold medallion as he shot from the hip in an attempt to rile-up local politicians , that he was now wearing a designer suit and tie , and advising top-ranking State Department officials on international policy-and no one cared to listen . But nowadays , Sharpton says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microphones and whether or not he makes it on the evening news . While he admits that there was a time when he was so flamboyant , so unpredictable , so media hungry that many times he , not the cause , was the center of attention , he now understands that effective anger needs method , his outrage needs direction . " I do regret the times when I have spoken too quickly , not in the sense of saying things that I did n't mean , but being more emotional , personal , and not weighing things , " says the 46-year-old leader as he sits in his Harlem office at the headquarters of the National Action Network he founded a decade ago . " Because sometimes you can get in the way of your own cause with personal hurt or personal feelings . I regret sometimes allowing people to lure me into distractions . " So now when he speaks , he thinks first , and when he fights for a cause , he thinks outside New York City and the local arena . In his office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther King Jr . and the Rev. Jesse Jackson on his desk . The photo was taken the day before King was assassinated in Memphis in 1968 , and given to him by Jackson . Unlike all of the other photos in his office , it faces him , and serves as a constant reminder of the gravity and humility of his calling . " I keep it on my desk because it helps me keep focus , " Sharpton says . " It 's not about all of us . It 's a continuation of a chain from King 's generation to Jackson 's generation to my generation . The best we can do is be a good link on a long chain that is bigger than all of us . The photograph helps me remember not to get caught up in my own ego . " Ego aside , Sharpton makes no bones about his goal . He 's on a mission to build a national civil-rights organization and a social movement the same way King did with SCLC and Jackson did with Operation Breadbasket and later the Rainbow/Push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social justice movement , " he says . " I want to build a continuation of the King-type movement in my generation . I 'm at the point in my life where national leadership is really what I 'm striving to achieve . " To say his movement has taken root and grown is an understatement . Since opening his " House of Justice " in Harlem in 1991 , Sharpton 's National Action Network has rapidly expanded across the country . He plans to have chapters in 20 cities by the end of the year-and dozens more over the next few years . He has moved beyond his trademark New York City police brutality cases to tackle national and international issues , even setting up an office in the Empire State Building to take on corporations and ad agencies that shortchange Black-owned and targeted media outlets . He is increasingly recognized and honored around the world . On a trip to Africa , swarms of people jockeyed for position to meet him , perhaps just to shake his hand , or ask for his help .

Maddox Jr. , a well-known New York City attorney who has known Sharpton since the mid- ' ' 80s , says Sharpton 's strength lies in his ability to communicate with people , regardless of their background . " It is not surprising to me that he has reached the heights that he has , ' Maddox says . " One of his strengths is that he actually comes out of the community , The masses of Black people , those who have no education and no recognition see him as one of their own . I think that is extremely significant at this time . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some say Jackson 's recent personal problems have opened the door for Sharpton to take a greater role on the civil-rights front . But Sharpton says both he and Jackson are needed to push various causes . " It 's absurd for us to throw away 35 years of service on a few situations , " he says . " It 's like we can only have one Black leader , and to make one , you have to kill the other . Even if you kill your father , it does n't give you life . You have to earn it . And I would n't even be in a position to even consider national leadership if it was n't for Jesse . I 've been a student of Jesse 's for 32 years . I do n't know anyone since King who did more for us as a people and as a country than Jesse . So what I do is not to compete with him , but to complement him , and to give a return in the investment he gave me over all these years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people making comparisons being between him and Jackson , and more and more people trying to create a riff between the two of them . And although he does believe that the once-controversial young activist of Chicago may now be perceived to be too " establishment , " he says he has nothing but love for Jackson . " Jesse told me that they did this with him and Ralph Abernathy , " Sharpton says . " They said he was taking the movement from Abernathy . So we 've seen this before . As long as we do n't get confused , and the people around us do n't get confused , let the media do what it wants to do . But I want to make it clear that whatever I do , a lot of it has to do with his training and support . I will continue his work , not compete with it . Ai n't nobody I know who can compete with Jesse Jackson . " To make it to the point where he has a legitimate shot at carrying the torch of a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sought to discredit him and the Blacks who bought into his rhetoric . " A lot of people wait to see if you are going to survive , " he says . " Endurance kind of wears down your opposition . But also things kept happening . When I used to talk about police brutality in the early ' ' 80s , people kind of dismissed me . But after Rodney King , a lot people were like , You know , Sharpton ai n't that crazy . ' Then after Abner Louima they started coming to the rallies . Then after Amadou Diallo , they were going to jail with me . You ca n't keep telling people that Sharpton 's making this stuff up when it keeps happening . So we have gone from people saying 10 years ago he 's just making trouble to people saying now , ' I hope he gets back from Africa soon so he can get to Cincinnati , because we need him there . ' They see what we talked about was real . I just thank God that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand where I 'm coming from . " He says through it all , he has never thought about giving it up . " I just thought about how to take different tactics , different strategies that would be more effective , " he says . " Anytime a Black leader emerges who will question racism in this country , he or she better get ready to be hammered by what is called mainstream media . ' The goal is not to get angry , but survive it and get as much done as you can . The only reason I do what I do is because I believe in it . Because I have certainly gone through some bumps in the road . It has n't been a glorious road . But if someone does n't do it , then who 's going to move the cause forward ? " But the man who has gone from a high of 311 pounds to a current 215 pounds through exercise and diet may face his biggest challenge yet-convincing African-Americans and others that the struggle for civil rights and equal protection under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 years ago . " I think too many people in my generation and , the generation of people in their 20s , are disconnected to struggle , " he says . " We think because we are doing a little better that the struggle is over . In many ways , we are programmed to feel that things are more over than they really are . There have been some improvements , but those improvements came as a result of struggle . That does n't mean you stop the struggle . " Photograph During a demonstration in Atlantic City , N.J. , Sharpton is taken into custody after leading a march and sit-in to protest racial profiling by the New Jersey State Police , " Anytime a Black leader emerges who will question racism , he or she better get ready to be hammered , " he says . // He calls his style of activism " nonviolent , Black churchbased . " He uses civil disobedience to expose problems in a manner of style that he learned from studying Jackson , who learned it from studying King . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " We work to create a climate for change . " Sharpton says the biggest misconception about him is that he 's new to the world of activism . " People do n't realize that I 've been in the movement all my life . A lot of people think that I just jumped out here 10 years ago with Howard Beach , " he says . " I was doing this 15 years before I was ever in the media . I do n't know anything else . I would do this if there were no cameras there . My lifelong drive has been the movement . That 's all I 've done all my life . " Born in Brooklyn in 1954 , Sharpton grew up in a well-todo family . His father owned a successful contracting business and moved his family into a 10-room house in Queens when he was a toddler . He remembers his father buying a new Cadillac every year . At age 4 , " when most kids were playing , I was reading the Bible . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharpton says he was so into the Bible that he started preaching the gospel . Standing on a box so that he could see over the podium , Sharpton preached sermonettes every week at his church . It was n't long before he became known in New York City and , to some extent , around the country , as " the Wonder Boy Preacher . " At age 9 , Sharpton took his ministry on the road , preaching during intermission at Mahalia Jackson concerts and at the World 's Fair . But his life took a dramatic turn at the age of 10 , when his parents separated , and he , his sisters and his mother moved back to the projects in Brooklyn . It was the move out of suburbia , the abrupt change of environment , that lit a fire under Sharpton that would change the course his life would take . " I knew the garbage man was supposed to pick up the garbage on time , because he did when we lived in Queens , " he says . " I knew the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambulance was n't supposed to take four hours . I lived where the schools were better . A lot of my activism started with that - the thought that , Wait a minute , we do n't have to take this . There 's a better life . " ' It was during this time that Sharpton started hanging around Adam Clayton Powell , a legendary politician and civil rights leader in Harlem . Powell took to Sharpton because of his preaching history . Sharpton took to Powell because he provided a father-figure Sharpton desperately needed . " It meant a lot to me for a man of his stature to take time for me , " Sharpton says . Jesse Jackson , who had also heard of Sharpton 's preaching abilities , recruited him-at age 12-to become youth director of Operation Breadbasket in New York City . In 1971 , Sharpton left Operation Breadbasket to found the National Youth Movement , Inc . During the same period , Sharpton developed a relationship with singer James Brown , and even traveled with him from city to city during his concert tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House to meet Ronald Reagan , who , at the time , was considering a national Martin Luther King Jr . holiday . Brown told Sharpton he wanted him to come along . But before he took Sharpton to the White House , he first took him to his hairdresser , who permed Sharpton 's afro . " He said , " I want Reagan to see a younger version of me when he sees you , ' ' " Sharpton recalls . " After I did it , he said he wanted me to keep my hair like that until he died , as our bond . So that 's how I ended up with this hairstyle . Later , it became a trademark for me . But people never understood that it is a personal thing between James and me . Even when he got into trouble and went to jail , he would call me every other day and say , Rev. , you holding up with your hair ? " ' Photograph At Sharpton 's 45th birthday celebration , the Rev.

Inside the Sharptons ' New York home ( below ) , the civil rights leader and his wife pose for a photograph . // Sharpton , often called " flamboyant " because of his hair , says that is a relative term . " If you grew up under Jesse Jackson and James Brown , you would consider yourself conservative . " He says he 's not planning to change his hairstyle in the foreseeable future . To cut his hair would change his image because people believe his defiance is reflected in his hairstyle . " I 'm going to have my one style . People would probably see it as my conforming , and I have no intentions on conforming . " Since his days with Brown , Sharpton , who married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a spirited run to be the first Black senator from New York in 1991 , and has run for New York City mayor , but he has mostly focused his time and energy on cases involving civil rights abuses . He says every case he has fought , the victim , or someone on behalf of the victim , has come to him and asked for assistance . " I think people get this image that I sit around at night with a walkie-talkie waiting for something to happen , " he says . " People also think that we only jump on big cases . Ninety percent of the cases that are big , we made them big . People would have never heard of these cases if we had not marched . We made these cases what they were . The movement made them big . " One case that may have gotten too big was the case of Tawana Brawley , whom he helped propel into the national spotlight after the teenager claimed that a group of White men had attacked her and smeared her body with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges , which he said were fabricated by Brawley . To this day , however , she maintains the truth of her allegations , and Sharpton has refused to apologize for vigorously defending her . Although Sharpton admits that the case hurt his public image , and although he says he has n't talked to Brawley in about four years , he does n't regret it . The father of two daughters , Dominique and Ashley , Sharpton says it has become more important for him to gain the respect of those he holds in high regard . - You might not care what the world thinks , but you do n't want your daughters to look at you in a way that is disapproving , " he says . " They make you more cognizant of how you want to come off . When you realize that you are out here for more than you , and that a lot of people are depending on you , it will make you sober and a lot more circumspect than you normally would be . That , more than anything , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You mature . " Indeed , Sharpton is at a sweet spot in his life . He says he is " old enough to know what I 'm doing and young enough to get it done . " He 's finally content with himself , and his mission . " Twenty years from now I want people to say that in my time I helped to keep the flame burning of the social justice movement , " Sharpton says . " After I 'm gone , my hairstyle wo n't matter , my jogging suits wo n't matter . But what I do about racial profiling , police brutality and the international fight against slavery will matter . Because when you are no longer there as a personality , they have to look at your work . The people who study you will study you because of substance , not style . I do n't know what kind of suits Dr. King wore . I do n't care . I do n't know what kind of hairstyle Marcus Garvey wore .
