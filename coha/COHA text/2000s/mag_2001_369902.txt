When I opened my e-mail the other day , a blond woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen . She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm . Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss . I guess it detracts from the overall picture to say that the e-mail she was reading to me came from my brother . And that a lot of it was about the trouble he was having getting the phone company to install his high-speed Internet hookup . Still , it was pretty cool . <P> Rachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail . Facemail lets you send e-mail that gets read to the recipient by an attractive male or female form or by a devil or a clown . The software , which is free , can be downloaded at
