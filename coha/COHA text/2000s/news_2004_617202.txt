<p> Newly married and going to nursing school , Joy Walters was n't thinking about buying a house with her husband , James . Then they visited her sister Jane in her new home in Charleston Park . <p> " We 're a close family , and Jane has two little ones , so we were just getting together for dinner and helping with the kids a lot , " said Joy Walters . " But it 's so much fun to look in new homes that we began going inside the houses going up and thinking about what kind of home we 'd like to have . " <p> Joy Walters grew up in Atlanta , so she thought she and James would buy a condo or loft in Midtown as a first home . They discovered that for less money , they could buy a three-bedroom house with a yard in Charleston Park . <p> " A large , level lot next to a natural drainage area came available , and it would accommodate the ranch plan with a basement that we liked best . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still thought we were about six months away from being able to buy a house , " said Joy . <p> " What made it all work out is that Bowen worked with us to reduce the closing costs  --  and even threw in a refrigerator . They listened to and met all our concerns . I never thought I could feel so at peace about buying our first house . " <p> The Walterses moved into their home in January . " My husband 's parents built their own house , so they 're going to help us finish the basement , which is enormous . Our open living area is large and feels even more spacious because of the vaulted ceiling , " she said . <p> " We love living near my sister and her family , and we 're expecting our first child . It 's amazing how everything has worked out perfectly , " she added . <p> Jane and Brian Parker started the ball rolling when they decided to move to a larger home and began researching communities on the Internet .

" My husband is finishing an office in the basement , and the bonus room is now the toy room , " said Jane Parker . With two young kids , she likes that the kitchen , dining room and living room open to each other , so she can keep an eye on the kids while cooking or doing laundry . <p> Farida and Abu Abdulmalik were looking for a big home with a yard for their three kids in the Dacula area , where he works .

" The schools are not far away , and my children already have friends in the neighborhood .

In the summer , the pool is just a block away , " said Abdulmalik . <p> Kristi and Dan Wilkins knew they wanted to live in Dacula , where he had grown up and gone to high school . " We love the area because it has the convenience of being close to Ga . 316 and I-85 , yet it still has a quiet , suburban atmosphere , " said Wilkins . <p> As first-time buyers , they chose Charleston Park because they felt they got more house for their money .

It 's all about coming home to a nice place that gives you peace of mind and makes you happy .
