For nearly 25 years , Kenesaw Mountain Landis imposed his iron will on every facet of the game <p> Back when baseball was widely considered a pastime and not a business , when fans wore fedoras instead of baseball caps and players had nicknames like Lefty and Pepper , the game 's integrity rested in a single office . A player ordered to report to that office took a cab to 333 North Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago . After riding the elevator to an upper floor , the player would tread softly on hallway carpet until reaching a door . On it was stenciled a single word-BASEBALL . <p> Behind baseball 's door stood all the trappings of authority . Tall shelves were lined with law books . Greeting the player , a secretary told him to have a seat . The judge would be right with him . As the player sat , a stream of populist profanity spewed from the adjacent office . " Pishtush ! You tell that blankety-blank SOB that I said ... " Moments later , the player was summoned into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk cluttered with papers . A box of chewing tobacco sat on the desk ; a spittoon stood alongside . And striding forward , extending a bony hand , was the short , wiry man who served as baseball 's judge , jury and Julius Caesar . <p> From the seasons of a young Babe Ruth to the days of Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams , Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was baseball 's court of last resort . As commissioner , he imposed his iron will on every level of the game , from minor league squabbles to major league scandals . He overruled trades . He banished players for life . He suspended Babe Ruth as easily as he had once subpoenaed John D. Rockefeller . Ostensibly , Landis worked for the owners who hired him in 1920 , yet his contract stated that he could not be fired , docked in pay or criticized in public . He had the authority to investigate anything " suspected to be detrimental to the best interests of the national game , " and he never hesitated to use that authority . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American history , " while others regard him as " the savior of baseball . " But throughout his nearly 25 years in charge of the game , owners , players and fans called him " the judge . " <p> With his perpetual scowl and bold shock of white hair , Landis looked like God in a three-piece suit . He lived in elite hotels , dining from room service , yet he chewed tobacco like a slugger and swore like a sailor . Where did baseball find such a character ? " The legend has been spread that the owners hired the Judge off the federal bench , " the feisty player and manager Leo Durocher remembered . " Do n't you believe it . They got him right out of Dickens . " Born in 1866 , Landis was named for the mountain in Georgia where his father , a Union surgeon on the march with General Sherman , nearly lost a leg . ( Abraham Landis , for reasons known only to himself , chose an alternative spelling of Kennesaw , dropping one " n . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana , kids called the young Landis " every damned thing they could think of , " he recalled . But his older siblings , noting his imperious air even as a boy , dubbed him The Squire . Though he grew to just 5 feet 7 inches , he commanded respect . During the early 1880s , he played first base for the Goosetown , Indiana , semipro team and became its manager at 17 . Offered a pro contract , he turned it down , preferring to play " merely for sport and the love of the game . " He was also a fierce bicycle racer , winning many medals at county fairs , yet he did not seem likely to succeed at much else . <p> Unable to sit still in class , Landis dropped out of high school . He worked as a handyman , sold newspapers and eventually became a court reporter . In the courtroom , the indifferent student proved himself adept at winning influential friends . In 1886 he began a rapid rise . First , an acquaintance who became Indiana 's Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landis was admitted to the Indiana bar . Back then , he remembered , " All a man needed was to prove that he was 21 and had a good moral character . " Eventually , however , he enrolled in a law school in Chicago , where , after graduating , he hung out a shingle . Then in 1893 came another quantum career leap . Abraham Landis ' former commanding officer , Walter Q. Gresham , became Grover Cleveland 's Secretary of State . Gresham quickly appointed the younger Landis his personal secretary . At the ripe old age of 26 , Landis found himself hobnobbing with diplomats . Eventually , he even represented the U.S. Department of State at Cabinet meetings . Cleveland later offered Landis the post of minister to Venezuela , but by that time he had met a charming socialite , Miss Winifred Reed . In 1895 he returned to Chicago , got married , practiced law and became a fixture at Cubs games . <p> Baseball at the turn of the century was as different from today 's game as Boston 's creaky Fenway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players were raw farm boys , immigrants fresh from mill towns , and backroom brawlers with something to prove . The Chicago Cubs were by no means the best team in baseball-John McGraw 's Giants , Connie Mack 's Athletics and Fred Clarke 's Pirates were better-but by 1906 they would be . Their games , all played under the natural light of the sun , made truants of schoolboys and a slacker of one feisty lawyer in particular . " Ca n't we get a postponement of the case until tomorrow ? " Landis once asked an opposing lawyer . " Brownie is pitching against Matty and I just ca n't miss that . " Mordecai Peter Centennial " Three Finger " Brown was the Cubs ' star pitcher and Landis ' favorite ; Christopher " Christy " Mathewson was the star pitcher of the New York Giants . Landis loved baseball as much for its honesty as for its home runs , which in those " deadball " days were relatively infrequent . ( The introduction , in 1909 , of a cork-centered ball and then , in 1920 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new kind of yarn that could be wound tighter , resulted in a sharp upturn in home-run production . ) " It is a great game this baseball-a great game , " he mused . " It is remarkable for the hold it has on the people , and equally remarkable for its cleanness . " Yet as crowds flocked to ballparks and gamblers to growing baseball pools , the " great game " was about to be dragged through the mud . <p> When two of his brothers were elected to Congress , Landis was encouraged to run for office . He declined , but again backed the right horse . After one of his cronies helped Theodore Roosevelt win reelection in 1904 , the man recommended Landis to the President for a newly created judgeship in Chicago . Roosevelt acceded to that request . As a federal judge , Landis treated the courtroom as his stage . His sense of justice , while occasionally blind , was never boring . If a lawyer 's line of questioning seemed suspicious , Landis would screw up his nose as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat and pointed his finger at a witness , saying , " Now , let 's stop fooling around and tell exactly what did happen , without reciting your life history . " And once when an old felon protested that he 'd never finish a five-year sentence , the judge scowled and said , " Well , you can try , ca n't you ? " <p> Murder and mayhem , bribery and fraud , each case gave " The Squire " a reason to be righteous . But he might have remained as anonymous as most other federal judges had it not been for United States v. Standard Oil of Indiana . By 1907 Standard Oil of New Jersey controlled 85 percent of the country 's refined oil and was the nation 's most hated trust . In Landis ' courtroom , its subsidiary , Standard Oil of Indiana , stood accused of colluding with the railroads and using its huge volume to obtain lower rates . When Standard 's lawyers dodged questions , Landis furiously subpoenaed top officials , including the president John D. Rockefeller himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too frail to testify , but Landis thundered , " This court is no respecter of wealth or other claims of immunity ! " <p> Saturday , July 6 , 1907 , was a hot , humid day in Chicago but a great day for a baseball game . Both the Cubs and Chicago 's other professional team , the White Sox , occupied first place in their respective leagues . The Cubs were out of town , but the Sox were hosting Connie Mack 's Philadelphia Athletics . Landis could n't attend because he had a rendezvous with the richest man in America . Just before 10 a.m. , hundreds gathered outside Landis ' courtroom . " Here he comes ! " someone shouted . Twenty Chicago policemen cleared a path as , wearing an icy blank stare , Rockefeller arrived for his day in court . <p> Under Landis ' questioning , Rockefeller admitted his company ran " an oil refinery in New Jersey , " but granted little more , evading and hesitating while Landis tapped his glasses . When the judge fined Standard Oil of Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually by the federal government , the public was ecstatic . The " frail " Rockefeller , receiving the news on the golf course , coolly drove a ball down the fairway and later remarked , " Judge Landis will be dead a long time before this fine is paid . " He was right . An appeals court overturned Landis ' verdict , something that happened frequently . <p> During World War I , Landis , by then known as a super-patriot , became fiercely intolerant . He lashed out at German-Americans , saying " Their hearts are reeking with disloyalty . " In 1918 , when members of the Industrial Workers of the World , or IWW ( usually referred to as the Wobblies ) , were accused of draft evasion and other acts of sedition , Landis presided . Ignoring pleas for clemency from Helen Keller and other luminaries , Landis handed out sentences of up to 20 years and imposed fines totaling $2.3 million . <p> Five years later , President Calvin Coolidge commuted Landis ' IWW sentences , but by then the judge had a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight Chicago White Sox threw the 1919 World Series , the team was known as the Black Sox . Along with paying baseball 's stingiest salaries , Sox owner Charles Comiskey cut his team 's laundry budget to the bone , hence the nickname . But as the heavily favored Sox were blowing the Series , rumors flew . The fix was in . An extensive cover-up kept the truth hidden until just before the 1920 Series . That fall , with the game 's image tarnished , club owners voted to disband their governing National Commission . <p> The Black Sox scandal was n't the owners ' only concern . For several years prior to that , political infighting between the leagues had all but nullified the Commission 's ability to run things . Baseball was coming close to anarchy and something had to be done . One strong man was needed to run the show , restoring both order and integrity to America 's game . Among the candidates were former President William Howard Taft , Gen. John Pershing and Landis . The judge had the inside track because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding players to teams for life . Now , thinking he was on their side , the owners turned to him . <p> On November 12 , 1920 , the most powerful men in baseball entered the courtroom where Landis was presiding over a bribery case . Seated , the team owners talked among themselves . " There 'll be less noise in this courtroom or I will order it cleared , " Landis boomed . After adjournment , tycoons whose names adorned ballparks-Ebbets , Griffith , Comiskey-entered the judge 's chambers with hats in hand . Flattered by the offer to become baseball 's commissioner , Landis nonetheless protested that he was " doing important work " on the bench . The owners insisted he could do both jobs . For the love of the game , and the dual salary-$7,500 as judge and $42,500 as commissioner-Landis agreed . <p> Landis began rising at 5 a.m. to work as a federal judge and baseball 's jury . He continued until the dual income led to censure by the American Bar Association and the threat of Congressional impeachment . In March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to baseball . <p> Nearly a year after the Black Sox scandal broke , all eight players were acquitted . Then it was Commissioner Landis ' turn to overrule . " Regardless of the verdict of juries , baseball is entirely competent to protect itself against crooks , both inside and outside the game , " he declared . Whether a player had taken $35,000 , as had " Chick " Gandil , or had taken no money and thrown no games , as was the case with Buck Weaver , mattered little to Landis . He banished all eight men for life . <p> That was just the beginning of the judge 's housecleaning . Landis loathed gamblers , those " vermin " who would " sell out their mothers or the Virgin Mary . " They were bent on getting " their slimy fingers around baseball , " he said . " But by God , so long as I have anything to do with this game , they 'll never get another hold on it . " Over the next four years , he blacklisted 7 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games but most , like Weaver , had merely been approached by gamblers , then failed to tell their team . Landis banished a New York Giants ' pitcher for " treachery " after the man wrote a letter suggesting he was open to a fix . He ordered owners to sell any financial interests in racetracks , and years later , when crooner Bing Crosby tried to buy an interest in the Pittsburgh Pirates , Landis turned him down because he owned racehorses . <p> Players who flirted with the jazzier side of the Jazz Age could expect no mercy from the judge . One example was Benny Kauff . The New York Giants outfielder wore gaudy diamond rings , drove the kinds of cars usually owned by gangsters and often carried thousands in cash . He played the 1920 season under indictment for grand theft auto . No one seemed to mind-until Landis became commissioner . Come spring , Kauff made the long trek from the Giants ' training camp in San Antonio , Texas , to Landis ' Michigan Avenue office . There Landis suspended Kauff until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landis reviewed the case himself . " The acquittal smells to high heaven , " he said . Kauff never played baseball again . <p> Banning a .274 hitter was one thing . But would the new commissioner have enough stature to take on the Sultan of Swat himself ? It can be argued that no player has ever had a better season than Babe Ruth had in 1921 . He hit more homers , 59 , than eight entire teams had that year . He also set records for extra base hits , total bases , runs , and runs batted in , some of which still stand . By season 's end , Ruth 's name had appeared in American newspapers more often than anyone 's except President Harding 's . When Ruth booked a number of postseason exhibition games to cash in on his fame , Landis upheld a longstanding ban on such barnstorming by World Series players . <p> Summoned to the judge 's office , Ruth refused to show , then called to tell Landis he was heading to Buffalo to play ball . Landis slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that big ape think he is ? " Ruth 's reply ? " Aw , tell the old guy to go jump in a lake . " After Ruth went ahead , Landis fined him his entire World Series share and suspended him for the first six weeks of the 1922 season . When the two met in spring training , Ruth asked for a pardon ; he got a two-hour lecture instead . " He sure can talk , " Ruth said , but he never crossed the judge again . <p> Wayward players felt the judge 's holy wrath , but others found him paternal . Despite his lordly status , Landis always addressed players formally as gentlemen-Mr . Gehrig , Mr. Hornsby , Mr. Cobb-and watched over them like a hen watches over her chicks . When players had personal problems , Landis helped them . He once sent an aide to take the great pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander , a binge-drinking alcoholic , home to his family . When Landis heard that a player he had banished was nearly indigent , he sent the man a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ballplayer , " Leo Durocher recalled . " He had no use for the owners at all . ' Do n't worry about them , ' he would tell me , ' They 're not out to help you . You know where your friend is . Right here . I 'm your man . ' " <p> Players and fans loved Landis , but others did not . The powerful American League president Ban Johnson resented Landis ' absolute authority and schemed against him . Finally , Landis , who always carried a letter of resignation in his pocket , threatened to quit unless Johnson did . The owners backed Landis . <p> The judge 's arbitrary decisions baffled sportswriters . Why did he ban the Black Sox , then refuse to do the same to Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker when those two stars were accused of throwing a game back in 1919 ? Johnson suspended Cobb and Speaker , but Landis reinstated them . Public outcry may have swayed his decision , but Landis claimed there was n't enough evidence . Besieged by other old scandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that happened before I came into baseball ever stop coming up ? " and put a statute of limitations on such cases . <p> By the late 1920s , Landis , with a little help from his friend Babe Ruth , had restored the luster of the national pastime . In big new stadiums , attendance was soaring . Baseball 's number-one fan was Landis himself . He seemed to be at every important game , watching from his box , his head resting on the railing , his snow-white hair signaling his presence like a beacon . He rarely spoke , just watched and scowled , like an eagle casting a cold eye down from his aerie . Here was Landis at the World Series in Yankee Stadium . There was Landis dedicating minor-league parks in Montreal , Columbus , Terre Haute ... He chose announcers for the Series , lecturing them about the perils of partisanship . He signed every World Series check . Once an official scorer asked if Landis had any advice . " No , " the judge replied , " just go ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet just as he preserved baseball 's integrity , the judge also preserved its timeworn traditions . <p> During the Depression , owners sought ways to boost sagging attendance . Landis opposed every change . He vowed night baseball would never happen under his watch , but as it turned out he could not stop it . He fought the farm system through which clubs bought minor-league teams to develop their own talent . He upheld baseball 's unwritten ban on black players and did nothing to push owners toward integration . <p> But by the 1940s , pressure was mounting . In 1943 the Pittsburgh Pirates tried to sign Josh Gibson , the legendary slugger who played for the Homestead Grays . Landis put a stop to it . " The colored ballplayers have their own league , " he said . " Let them stay in their own league . " <p> The most famous story of his opposition to integration was told by the maverick owner Bill Veeck . According to Veeck , Landis stopped him from buying the Phillies after Veeck told him he planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge 's office to Philadelphia , Veeck claimed , control of the Phillies had been turned over to the National League and the team was soon sold to another buyer . Yet some now doubt the story . " Veeck may have made it up out of whole cloth , and it has distorted Landis ' image tremendously , " says veteran sportswriter Robert W. Creamer . " Landis was no angel . He reflected the institutional racism of his times . But he was n't quite the devil he 's been portrayed . " Baseball remained segregated until 1947 , when the Brooklyn Dodgers ' owner , Branch Rickey , signed Jackie Robinson . By then , Landis was no longer watching from his box . <p> In 1944 the judge missed the World Series for the first time since becoming commissioner . Two days before the Series began , he entered the hospital complaining of shortness of breath . At 78 , he had survived prostate cancer and chronic respiratory problems , but friends expected he would soon be visiting ballparks again . When he did n't emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they knew his condition must be serious . In mid-November , the owners renewed Landis ' seven-year contract , but a week later the judge died in his sleep . His departure was the least theatrical act of his life . There was no funeral . He was cremated and buried beneath a modest headstone in Chicago . Two weeks later he was given a more fitting memorial when the Baseball Hall of Fame named him a member . His plaque in Cooperstown reads : " His Integrity and Leadership Established Baseball in the Respect , Esteem and Affection of the American People . " <p> Today the judge is remembered for the independence he brought to his office . No subsequent commissioner has measured up to his standards of power and authority . Not long after Landis died , the owners regained ascendancy and have guarded it jealously ever since . Landis ' immediate successor , A. B. " Happy " Chandler , a onetime Kentucky governor and U.S. senator , never approached the judge in stature , and when he did begin to exert power on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every commissioner since has had to pay attention to what the owners want . <p> These days no one bothers to pretend that baseball is a mere pastime . The " Steves " and " Matts " who replaced the " Leftys " and " Peppers " make more money than any gambler could offer them . Yet in spite of everything-the rampant commercialism , the spitting on umpires , the trash talk and the drug scandals-at least one of the old judge 's verdicts on the game 's meaning and importance has not been overturned . " Baseball is something more than a game to an American boy , " he declared . " It is his training field for life work . Destroy his faith in its squareness and honesty and you have destroyed something more ; you have planted suspicion of all things in his heart . " <p> <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The renowned N.Y .
