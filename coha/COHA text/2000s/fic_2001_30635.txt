Chapter One : " Sometimes Thro ' the Mirror Blue " " Now , Kitty , let 's consider who it was that dreamed it all . This is a serious question , my dear , and you should not go on licking your paw like thatas if Dinah had n't washed you this morning ! You see , Kitty , it must have been either me or the Red King . He was part of my dream , of coursebut then I was part of his dream , too ! Was it the Red King , Kitty ? You were his wife , my dear , so you ought to knowOh , Kitty , do help to settle it ! I 'm sure your paw can wait ! "  --  Chapter 12 , " Which Dreamed It ? " Through the Looking-Glass , Lewis Carroll Mama said that when she was a little girl , before her house in London was bombed , she would often creep out of her bed at night and open the door between her nursery and the top of the back staircase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs to make sure the door was closed and no servants were around . Then , spreading her white nightgown around her and slowly rising off the ground , she would fly up and down the passageway . She knew she had n't been dreaming because when she awoke on mornings after flight , there would be dust on her fingertips where she had touched the ceiling . My mother was a child hidden away . She , like many upper-class and upper-middle-class English children of her day , was raised by staff in the nursery . I grew up hearing grim tales of nursery life . The one brief , bright spot was a nice governess , Nurse Reed , who took little Claire home with her on visits to her family . Nurse Reed 's replacement , a Swiss-German who , among her many delightful qualities , used to force Claire , after lunch , to sit on the toilet until she " produced , " or until suppertime , whichever came first , was more the norm . I knew , too , that she was sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she was taught to bathe her little body under a sheet so God would n't be offended by her nakedness . I used to think about that when I was a little girl sitting in the tub , how scary a wet sheet over you would feel , as if you 'd get caught under the immensity of it and sucked down the drain . Once , when I was in the hospital with poison ivy , my mother told me that when she was at the convent and got poison ivy , the nuns scrubbed her head to toe , beneath the sheet of course , with a bristle brush and lye soap to remove the evil ivy boils . What I did n't understand was why she was there . I did n't wonder about it when I was little and assumed that things just happen to children as inexorably as the catechism . But now , as an adult , it no longer made sense to me , and I asked her about it . My mother explained that at the time , in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Londoners ' lives was that there was a war on . During the Blitz , parents with the means and " any sense at all , " she said , took their families out of London and went to stay with friends or relatives in the country . The Doug-las family had both country relations and money ; nevertheless , Claire and her brother , Gavin , were packed on a train , unaccompanied , " with all the poor children , " and evacuated to a convent at St. Leonard's-by-the-Sea . St. Leonard 's had the unfortunate geographical attribute of being opposite Dunkirk , and they were soon evacuated again , this time inland to a sister convent in what my mother only remembers as a red-bricked city . She was five years old . There was no comfort to be found in her elder brother , who , at seven , had a well-developed penchant for torturing animals and small girls . " He liked to cause pain , poor boy , it confused him terribly . " " Why ? " I asked , grateful that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter while he was alive . " Mom , what was wrong with Gavin ? " The answer came back flat and blunt : " The man my mother got her black market meat from was a pederast . When he came to the house , he bothered me a couple of times , but it was mostly my brother he was interested in , not me , thank God . I do n't think he ever recovered from it . " In the fall of 1941 , as Jerome Salinger had his first story , " The Young Folks , " published , Claire , age seven , and her nine-year-old brother , Gavin , were put on a train to Southampton , where they were met by a governess . She informed them that their family 's house had been bombed and had burnt to the ground . The Douglases had been out for the evening when the bomb struck , but Claire 's beloved kitten , Tiger Lily , was nowhere to be found . The governess deposited Claire and Gavin on a ship , the Scythia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned and marched off the ship . The ship was packed with stunned , weeping children headed for the safety of the United States to sit out the war . One bit of contact , which Claire clung to like a life preserver , was to stand on the deck each day and wave to the children on the deck of their sister ship , The City of Benares , which carried the same cargo of unaccompanied children and sailed alongside them in close convoy . The children would wave back to her . Several days out of Southampton , as Claire was exchanging waves , a German torpedo ripped into the side of the Benares . It exploded into flames . Claire watched in mute horror as it sank , children screaming and dancing as they burned . The Scythia disembarked at Halifax , Nova Scotia . From Halifax , Claire and Gavin traveled alone by train to Waycross , Georgia , to meet their first host family . They were in Georgia when , on December 7 of that year , the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight different American foster homes because of Gavin 's behavior . " And you know what happens to little girls in foster care ... , " my mother said , as though we were both in on some kind of secret not to be mentioned , only hinted at . Their second placement was in Tampa , Florida . She remembers being terribly sunburned and attributes her midlife melanoma to her Tampa stay . The next stop , about the time Staff Sergeant Jerome Salinger was preparing to take Utah Beach on D-Day , was Wilmington , Delaware , where she attended the Tower Hill School for about a year . This was followed by placements with families in Allentown , Pennsylvania ; Sea Girt , New Jersey ; and Glens Falls , New York . I never heard about these places growing up . My mother did n't have to think for two seconds , though , to remember . The towns , and the order in which the placements occurred , were literally at her fingertips as she ticked them off , counting on her fingers the way my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the days of the week . " Waycross , Tampa , Wilmington ... " " Where were your parents ? " I asked , assuming they must have been unable to leave England . She told me that her father , an art dealer , came to America shortly after she did , in 1941 , to sell some pictures in New York . He was stuck there while the shipping passage was blocked by German U-boats . When it opened , he sent for his wife and they spent the duration of the war in New York City building up the business at Duveen Brothers and getting established . When the war ended , the foster program ended , too , and the Douglases had to collect their children , at which point Claire was sent off to the Convent of the Holy Child in Suffern , New York , where she stayed until the end of eighth grade ; Gavin went to Milton Academy . " How were they able to have their children taken care of by American families on that war program when they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me this story . She shook her head and said , " God only knows what story my mother told them . " She stayed with her parents in their New York apartment on the occasional school holiday , sleeping under the dining room tablefor reasons unknown and probably unquestioned . In eighth grade , she refused to go back to the convent . " They were doing a number on my head , trying to coerce me into becoming a nun . The whole school was ordered to shun me , not to speak to me , until I had declared my decision . I was going mad . " Her parents did not , or could not , force her to return , and in the fall of 1947 they enrolled her , instead , at Shipley , a girls ' boarding school in Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania . Three years later , in the fall of 1950 , she met a writer named Jerry Salinger at a party in New York given by Bee Stein , an artist , and her husband , Francis Steegmuller , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same apartment building as the Steegmullers on East Sixty-sixth Street , and through their shared interest in the arts , they had become good friends as well as neighbors . Claire was sixteen and had just begun her senior year at Shipley . She arrived at the party looking strikingly beautiful , with the wide-eyed , vulnerable , on-the-brink look of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany 's or Leslie Caron in Gigi , a movie my father loved so much that he bought a reel-to-reel copy and played it for us so many times when I was growing up that , to this day , I can still sing the lyrics beginning to end . As a child , I never heard the names Holden Caulfield or Seymour Glass , but even now I ca n't hold a glass of champagne without hearing in my mind the song " The Night They Invented Champagne " from Gigi . Our shared world was not books , but rather , my father 's collection of reel-to-reel movies . During the long winters , our human visitors were , essentially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen in front of the fireplace in the living room , and I 'd lie on the rug watching Hitchcock 's The 39 Steps , The Lady Vanishes , Foreign Correspondent ; Laurel and Hardy ; W. C. Fields ; and the Marx Brothers , to name a few of our favorites . The neat , plastic videocassettes he now owns are a sterile substitute for the sensuous delight I remember then . My father would take the reel from the round metal case , as though unwrapping a present , and place it on the projector spindle . I watched him thread the film through the maze of the projector in a lovely over and under hide-and-seek ; his hands knew the special moves and codes for each location . When I threaded my old treadle Singer sewing machine for my 4-H class , I felt the same thrill of competence , of secrets mastered . When he secured the tail of the film in the empty reel , he was ready for me to turn off the lights . A thin blue stream of light beamed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke and dust playing in the flickering light . First the leader tape passed through with its strange hieroglyphics of bull's-eyes and numbers and scratches , absent the dire modern video warnings about the FBI , imprisonment , and fines written in legalese . Then the title appeared with the movie 's music and opening credits . Most of his movies were on two or three reels , so in the middle of the movie we had to stop , turn on the lights , and wait while my father rewound the spent reel and threaded the next . I liked the sound of the film at the end of each reel slapping against my father 's hand as it pulled free of the projector . I 'd never stick my hand in the midst of all that flapping . He was n't scared of getting cut at all , even when he had to stop the movie and splice the film together where it broke . Rewinding the film at intervals was also a chance for me to rewind , have a drink of juice or some peanuts , reassurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . Some of the Hitchcock movies scared me half to death , and not in a fun way . Much to my father 's disgust , I always had to leave the room in the middle of Foreign Correspondent and put my head under a pillow to block out the screams of that sweet old man , Van Meer , when the Nazis tortured him in a windmill , offscreen , to get him to talk . Of my flights to the next room , my father would say , " Christ , all you and your mother want to see are sentimental pictures about Thanksgiving and puppy dogs . " In my father 's vocabulary , sentimental was a very damning word indeed . Old Hitchcock movies , especially , became our secret language . As late as my senior year of high school , I 'd receive a postcard saying simply , " There is a man in Scotland I must meet if anything is to be done . These men act quickly , quickly " signed , in my dad 's handwriting , " Annabella Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . When my brother was at boarding school , I received many a letter from him signed " Huntley Haverstock " ( Foreign Correspondent ) . In short , we 'd all light on the choice of Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn , rather than some literary character , to describe the young Claire when they first met . Claire wore her chestnut hair smoothed back from her lovely forehead . Pretty mouth , fullish lips , and the kind of high cheekbones that promise a beauty that does not fade with youth . Claire 's large eyes are a limpid , liquid blue that reflect the ambient world , the way only hazel or green eyes are supposed to do . On a stormy day her eyes look gray and wind-tossed ; on a bright day at the beach , like blue sea glass and white sails . When her eyes became the color of a burnt match , it was a signal to her children to run and hide , fast . When her eyes became opaque , like those of a dead fish belly-up at the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children , to take charge and do whatever needed to be done to survive , because she could no more see us than a dead fish can see the flies buzzing around its eyes . Those little eyes so helpless and appealing , one day will flash and send you crashing through the ceiling . ( " Thank Heaven for Little Girls , " from Gigi ) The night my parents met , her eyes shone like a beacon across the room . She was wearing a mid-blue linen dress with a darker blue velvet collar , simple and elegant as a wild iris . " God , I loved that dress . I was a model for a designer called Nan Duskin that summer in New York . She let me keep it at the end of the season ... said it was made for me . And it was , it matched my eyes perfectly . I 've never worn anything more beautiful in my life . " " You wore a gown of gold ... " " I wore blue that night , and the month was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from Gigi ) Jerry , at thirty-one , was nearly twice her age and was quite simply , or rather , quite complicatedly , tall , dark , and handsome . My father captures his own image , refracted through the eyes of his beloved , fictional Glass family . Under the guise of Buddy Glass as the purported author of Seymour : An Introduction , he writes that several members of the Glass family , including himself , have eyes that " could all be rather bashfully described as extra-dark oxtail in color , or Plaintive Jewish Brown . " What I can tell you as his daughter , without the bashfulness of a male narrator , or the self-consciousness of a person looking at his own image in the mirror , is that my father 's eyes are absolutely beautiful , with thick , long , black eyelashesinherited by my brother and , a generation later , by my son ; the kind that women in the park , peeking into a carriage , click their tongues over and say , " Why is it always the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to describe or " introduce " his revered , dead brother , Seymour , writes : " ... he had very wiry black hair . The word is almost kinky , but not quite ; ... It was most exceedingly pullable-looking hair , and pulled it surely got ; the babies in the family always automatically reached for it , even before the nose , which , God wot , was also Outstanding . " When Jerry and Claire saw each other from across the room at the Steegmullers ' party , Claire was dumbstruck . They had each brought a date to the party , " so we could n't really talk much , " she told me . Every time she looked up , though , their eyes seemed to meet and she felt herself blush , afraid he might think she was rather forward . The next day Jerry phoned the hostess to thank her , and to ask her about that beautiful girl in the blue dress . She gave him Claire 's address at Shipley . The next week , Claire received a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agonizing over it , afraid she might not sound clever enough to a real writer . He telephoned and wrote to her off and on throughout the 1950-51 school year . She knew from his letters that he was hard at work finishing a novel . She thinks he changed the school that Holden 's friend Jane Gallagher attended to Shipley for her . " It was the sort of thing he 'd do , but I was too in awe and on my best behavior to ask . " She knew , too , that Jerry was seriously considering becoming a monk . He had become friends with Daisetz Suzuki and meditated , he told her , at a Zen center in the Thousand Islands . The next year , when The Catcher in the Rye was published , he abruptly switched to Vedanta and often studied with Swami Nikhilananda at the Vedanta center in the East Nineties . But he had already met Claire . " That 's right , " Teddy said . " I met a lady , and I sort of stopped meditating . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked his hands , as if to keep them warm , under his thighs . " I would have had to take another body and come back to earth again anywayI mean I was n't so spiritually advanced that I could have died , if I had n't met that lady , and then gone straight to Brahma and never again have to come back to earth . But I would n't have had to get incarnated in an American body if I had n't met that lady . " ( " Teddy " in Nine Stories , JDS ) When Claire came home to New York from Shipley for the summer , they started seeing each other . This was soon interrupted when each left for Europe , Jerry to the British Isles , to avoid being in America for the publication of The Catcher . " It 's a goddam embarrassment , publishing , " he once said to a fellow writer . " The poor boob who lets himself in for it might as well walk down Madison Avenue with his pants down . " Claire went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not come as a surprise to anyone who knew her father that old age finally caught up with Robert Langdon Douglas , or RLD as he was called by friends . He was nearly seventy when Claire , the last of his fifteen or so children , was born in 1933 . Baron 's Knights and Peerage records nine of them . By the time she can remember him , he was suffering from senile dementia . She told me once , at an age when I , too , would have " died " of embarrassment , that in the middle of a formal dinner party at their home in London , he boomed across the table in his plummy churchman 's voice , " Claire , have you moved your bowels today ? " RLD 's final years were characterized by similar occurrences of progressive unpredictability ; however , his decision to repair to Italy to spend his last days rather than to the Black Douglas Clan 's lair in Scotland was well considered . Two divergent paths of his long life led him , at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for retired clergy , high in the hills above Florence . He had been an Anglican priest and had had a parish in Oxford , England , for a time . Several wives and even more offspring later , it was thought best that he find some other mode of employment , and he began his second , highly successful career as an art dealer and historian . " Your grandfather , " I 've been told , " was largely responsible for putting the early Italian Masters , especially the Sienese , back on the map . " He wrote a lovely book on Fra Angelico , and though RLD was dead long before I was born , I used to take great comfort falling asleep beneath Giotto 's dark-skinned Madonna and Child when , as a young girl , I visited my grandmother in New York . Perhaps RLD did , too ; toward the end of his life he converted to Catholicism . When he died , he was awarded a hero 's funeral in Siena , where he is entombed in a great wall . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , with costumes , trumpets , and pageantry , to pay homage to the man who , through his work , had restored such honor to their city . My mother gave me his funeral proclamation by the city of Siena , a two-foot-by-three-foot document worthy of an honorary Italian . After the funeral , Claire returned to New York . Jerry was back as well and had settled into an apartment on Fifty-seventh Street . When Claire first saw it , she was speechless . It was , she told me , " one of those partly underground , ground-floor places , very underwater feeling . The whole apartment was black and white . I was appalled , frightened , excited , bug-eyed at the black sheets on his bed . They were the height of sophistication and depravity to me . For Jerry , though , I think the black sheets and the black bookshelves , black coffee table , and so on matched his depression . He really had black holes where he could hardly move , barely talk . " Claire would stay the night with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate . Jerry was very involved with Vivekananda 's Vedanta center at the time , she told me , and as his character Teddy said , meeting a woman was heading in the wrong direction for enlightenment . Sri Ramakrishna , Swami Vivekananda 's guru and predecessor , expressed the same opinion , though more forcibly , in his book The Gospels of Sri Ramakrishna ( which my father sent to his British publisher , Hamish Hamilton , as the only thing worth reading ) , saying : A man may live in a mountain cave , smear his body with ashes , observe fasts , and practice austere discipline , but if his mind dwells on worldly objects , on " woman and gold , " I say , " Shame on him ! " " Woman and gold " are the most fearsome enemies of the enlightened way , and woman rather more than gold , since it is woman that creates the need for gold . For woman one man becomes the slave of another , and so loses his freedom . Then he can not act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has been enjoying sexual intercourse with his wife , Ramakrishna replies , " Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? You have children , and still you enjoy intercourse with your wife . Do n't you hate yourself for thus leading an animal life ? Do n't you hate yourself for dallying with a body which contains only blood , phlegm , filth , and excreta ? " The summer after her freshman year at Radcliffe , Claire was back in New York , where she had a summer job as a model for Lord &; Taylor . She was careful to hide this from Jerry : " Your father would not have approved , all that vain , worldly , women-and-clothes stuff .... I did n't dare tell him . " Around the time Jerry began seeing Claire , he went on a couple of dates with Leila Hadley , a writer , whom he met through his friend S. J. Perelman . When Ms. Hadley saw that same apartment on East Fifty-seventh Street , she described it as " extremely bare " : There was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do rather good sketches , and when I read " De Daumier-Smith 's Blue Period , " I was sure he had based the hero on himself . On the wall of his apartment there was a picture of himself in uniform . In contrast to the young Claire , who was " too in awe and on my best behavior to ask " any personal questions , Ms. Hadley was confident enough , mature enough , to ask him questions and offer her own opinions rather than reflect his own . She said that Jerry " never talked about himself and he resented any personal questionsabout his family , or his background .... He was not easy to be with . " Their relationship was a brief one . This resentment of questions about family and background , about connections from island to mainland , runs like a mother lode through our family . ( Recall the opening of The Catcher in the Rye : " If you really want to hear about it , the first thing you 'll probably want to know is where I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how my parents were occupied and all before they had me ... my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them . They 're quite touchy about anything like that , especially my father . " ) My aunt DorisDaddy 's only sisterand I were talking recently about being raised not to ask any questions , and most especially , not to ask questions about one 's background , or as Holden put it , how one 's parents " were occupied and all before they had " you . Doris told me that by the time she was about seven , shortly after her brother was born , she had " learned enough about the birds and the bees " to figure out that her mother , Miriam , must have had parents . One day she said , " Mother , you must have a mother and daddy somewhere . Where are they ? " Her mother snapped , " People die , do n't they ? " That 's it . That was all she said . Doris heard from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbroken when , years later , her mother actually did die . Miriam never said a word about it to Doris though . Later that same year Doris saw her mother packing a box full of their baby clothes . Thinking they might be for her mysterious family , Doris asked her whom she was sending them to . " It is none of your business , " she was told with a glare . " Well , I just shut up and took it like I always did , " Doris told me . She has heard a whisper say , A curse is on her if she stay To look down to Camelot .
