The government knew we had airport security problems before September 11 . A new report shows what to do about them . <p> The ghastly suicide hijackings/murders of September 2001 have shocked the nation , triggered an anti-terrorist campaign around the globe , and pushed aircraft/airport security measures to the forefront of domestic issues . <p> In response to these developments , the Bush administration has drafted a series of security proposals for U.S. airports , and for the planes that use them . Included in the package are plans to federalize and consolidate responsibility for airport security ; expand and improve techniques for screening passengers , baggage , crews , and airport workers ; and enhance safeguards on board the planes themselves  --  e.g. , more strictly limited access to flight decks and providing crew members with non-lethal weapons such as stun guns . <p> As it happens , agencies of the U.S. government have been weighing issues of this type for upwards of a decade . In particular , the General Accounting Office , an investigative arm of Congress , has through the years made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aviation security set-up and urging measures to correct them . The following article , excerpted from a recent GAO update to Congress , summarizes key components of the agency 's findings , which we believe will be of utmost interest to consumers . <p>  --  Ed . <p> The events of September 11 , 2001 , have changed the way this country looks at aviation security . ... FAA and the air carriers have implemented new controls that promise a greater sense of security . We support these actions . Yet , to further minimize the vulnerabilities in our aviation security system , more needs to be done . ... <p> The threat of terrorism was significant throughout the 1990s ; a plot to destroy 12 U.S. airliners was discovered and thwarted in 1995 , for instance . Yet the task of providing security to the nation 's aviation system is unquestionably daunting , and we must reluctantly acknowledge that any form of travel can never be made totally secure . The enormous size of U.S. airspace alone defies easy protection . Furthermore , given this country 's hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daffy flights , and the seemingly limitless ways terrorists or criminals can devise to attack the system , aviation security must be enforced on several fronts . <p> Safeguarding airplanes and passengers requires , at the least , ensuring that perpetrators are kept from breaching security checkpoints and gaining access to secure airport areas or to aircraft . Additionally , vigilance is required to prevent attacks against the extensive computer networks that FAA uses to guide thousands of flights safely through U.S. airspace . FAA has developed several mechanisms to prevent criminal acts against aircraft , such as adopting technology to detect explosives and establishing procedures to ensure that passengers are positively identified before boarding a flight . Still , in recent years , we and others have often demonstrated that significant weaknesses continue to plague the nation 's aviation security . <p> Our work has identified numerous problems with aspects of aviation security in recent years . One such problem is FAA 's computer-based air traffic control system . The ATC system is an enormous , complex collection of interrelated systems , including navigation , surveillance , weather , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities and provide information to air traffic controllers and pilots . ... <p> In five reports issued from 1998 through 2000 , we pointed out numerous weaknesses in FAA 's computer security . FAA had not ( 1 ) completed background checks on thousands of contractor employees , ( 2 ) assessed and accredited as secure many of its ATC facilities , ( 3 ) performed appropriate risk assessments to determine the vulnerability of the majority of its ATC systems , ( 4 ) established a comprehensive security program , ( 5 ) developed service continuity controls to ensure that critical operations continue without undue interruption when unexpected events occur , and ( 6 ) fully implemented an intrusion detection capability to detect and respond to malicious intrusions . <p> Some of these weaknesses could have led to serious problems . For example , as part of its Year 2000 readiness efforts , FAA allowed 36 mainland Chinese nationals who had not undergone required background checks to review the computer source code for eight mission-critical systems . <p> To date , we have made nearly 22 recommendations to improve FAA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of them have yet to be completed . For example , it is making progress in obtaining background checks on contractors and accrediting facilities and systems as secure . However , it will take time to complete these efforts . <p> Control of access to aircraft , airfields , and certain airport facilities is another component of aviation security . Among the access controls in place are requirements intended to prevent unauthorized individuals from using forged , stolen , or outdated identification or their familiarity with airport procedures to gain access to secured areas . In May 2000 , we reported that our special agents , in an undercover capacity , obtained access to secure areas of two airports by using counterfeit law enforcement credentials and badges . At these airports , our agents declared themselves as armed law enforcement officers , displayed simulated badges and credentials created from commercially available software packages or downloaded from the Internet , and were issued " law enforcement " boarding passes . They were then waved around the screening checkpoints without being screened . <p> Our agents could thus have carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects onto aircraft . In response to our findings , FAA now requires that each airport 's law enforcement officers examine the badges and credentials of any individual seeking to bypass passenger screening . FAA is also working on a " smart card " computer system that would verify law enforcement officers ' identity and authorization for bypassing passenger screening . <p> The Department of Transportation 's Inspector General has also uncovered problems with access controls at airports . The Inspector General 's staff conducted testing in 1998 and 1999 of the access controls at eight major airports and succeeded in gaining access to secure areas in 68% of the tests ; they were able to board aircraft 117 times . After the release of its report describing its successes in breaching security , the Inspector General conducted additional testing between December 1999 and March 2000 and found that , although improvements had been made , access to secure areas was still gained more than 30% of the time . <p> Screening checkpoints and the screeners who operate them are a key line of defense against the introduction of dangerous objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their baggage must be checked each day for articles that could pose threats to the safety of an aircraft and those aboard it . The air carriers are responsible for screening passengers and their baggage before they are permitted into the secure areas of an airport or onto an aircraft . Air carriers can use their own employees to conduct screening activities , but mostly air carriers hire security companies to do the screening . ... <p> Concerns have long existed over screeners ' ability to detect and prevent dangerous objects from entering secure areas . Each year , weapons were discovered to have passed through one checkpoint and have later been found during screening for a subsequent flight . FAA monitors the performance of screeners by periodically testing their ability to detect potentially dangerous objects carried by FAA special agents posing as passengers . In 1978 , screeners failed to detect 13% of the objects during FAA tests . In 1987 , screeners missed 20% of the objects during the same type of test . <p> Test data for the 1991-to-1999 period show that the declining trend in detection rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests become more realistic and more closely approximate how a terrorist might attempt to penetrate a checkpoint , screeners ' ability to detect dangerous objects declines even further . <p> As we reported last year , there is no single reason why screeners fail to identify dangerous objects . Two conditions  --  rapid screener turnover and inadequate attention to human factors  --  are believed to be important causes . Rapid turnover among screeners has been a long-standing problem , having been identified as a concern by FAA and by us in reports dating back to at least 1979 . We reported in 1987 that turnover among screeners was about 100% a year at some airports and , according to our more recent work , the turnover is considerably higher . From May 1998 through April 1999 , screener turnover averaged 126% at the nation 's 19 largest airports ; five of these airports reported turnover of 200% or more , and one reported turnover of 416% . At one airport we visited , of the 993 screeners trained at that airport over about a one-year period , only 142 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Such rapid turnover can seriously limit the level of experience among screeners operating a checkpoint . <p> Both FAA and the aviation industry attribute the rapid turnover to the low wages and minimal benefits screeners receive , along with the daily stress of the job . Generally , screeners are paid at or near the minimum wage . We reported last year that some of the screening companies at 14 of the nation 's 19 largest airports paid screeners a starting salary of $6.00 an hour or less and , at five of these airports , the starting salary was less than the current minimum wage  --  $5.15 an hour . <p> It is common for the starting wages at airport fast-food restaurants to be higher than the wages screeners receive . For instance , at one airport we visited , screeners ' wages started as low as $6.25 an hour , whereas the starting wage at one of the airport 's fast-food restaurants was $7 an hour . <p> The demands of the job also affect performance . Screening duties require repetitive tasks as well as intense monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be observed . Too little attention has been given to factors such as ( 1 ) improving individuals ' aptitudes for effectively performing screener duties , ( 2 ) the sufficiency of the training provided to screeners and how well they comprehend it , and ( 3 ) the monotony of the job and the distractions that reduce screeners ' vigilance . As a result , screeners are being placed on the job who do not have the necessary aptitudes or the adequate knowledge to perform the work effectively , and who then find the duties tedious and dull . <p> We reported in June 2000 that FAA was implementing a number of actions to improve screeners ' performance . However , FAA did not have an integrated management plan for these efforts that would identify and prioritize checkpoint and human factors problems that needed to be resolved , and identify measures  --  and related milestone and funding information  --  for addressing the performance problems . Additionally , FAA did not have adequate goals by which to measure and report its progress in improving screeners ' performance . <p> FAA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve screeners ' performance are still not complete . These actions are the deployment of threat image projection systems  --  which place images of dangerous objects on the monitors of X-ray machines to keep screeners alert and monitor their performance  --  and a certification program to make screening companies accountable for the training and performance of the screeners they employ . Threat image projection systems are expected to keep screeners alert by periodically imposing the image of a dangerous object on the X-ray screen . They also are used to measure how well screeners perform in detecting these objects . Additionally , the systems serve as a device to train screeners to become more adept at identifying harder-to-spot objects . FAA is currently deploying the threat image projection systems and expects to have them deployed at all airports by 2003 . <p> The screening company certification program , required by the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 , will establish performance , training , and equipment standards that screening companies will have to meet to earn and retain certification . However , FAA has still not issued its final regulation establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Belgium , Canada , France , the Netherlands , and the United Kingdom  --  viewed by FAA and the civil aviation industry as having effective screening operations to identify screening practices that differ from those in the United States . We found that some significant differences exist in four areas : screening operations , screener qualifications , screener pay and benefits , and institutional responsibility for screening . <p> First , screening operations in some of the countries we visited are more stringent . For example , Belgium , the Netherlands , and the United Kingdom routinely touch or " pat down " passengers in response to metal detector alarms . Additionally , all five countries allow only ticketed passengers through the screening checkpoints , thereby allowing the screeners to more thoroughly check fewer people . Some countries also have a greater police or military presence near checkpoints . ... <p> Second , screeners ' qualifications are usually more extensive . In contrast to the United States , Belgium requires screeners to be citizens ; France requires screeners to be citizens of a European Union country . In the Netherlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have been residents of the country for five years . Training requirements for screeners were also greater in four of the countries we visited than in the United States . ... <p> Third , screeners receive relatively better pay and benefits in most of these countries . Whereas screeners in the United States receive wages that are at or slightly above minimum wage , screeners in some countries receive wages that are viewed as being at the " middle income " level in those countries . In the Netherlands , for example , screeners received at least the equivalent of about $7.50 per hour . This wage was about 30% higher than the wages at fast-food restaurants in that country . In Belgium , screeners received the equivalent of about $14 per hour . <p> Not only is pay higher , but the screeners in some countries receive benefits , such as health care or vacations  --  in large part because these benefits are required under the laws of these countries . These countries also have significantly lower screener turnover than the United States : turnover rates were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility for screening in most of these countries is placed with the airport authority or with the government , not with the air carriers as it is in the United States . In Belgium , France , and the United Kingdom , the responsibility for screening has been placed with the airports , which either hire screening companies to conduct the screening operations or , as at some airports in the United Kingdom , hire screeners and manage the checkpoints themselves . ... <p>
