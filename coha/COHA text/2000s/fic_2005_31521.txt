Prologue I 've always been jealous of witches . Not the incense-burning , tree-fondling kind , but the others  --  the ones that can cast real spells , that can turn people into livestock ( I 'd have turned my ex-husband into an aardvark  --  a faint subgenus resemblance  --  but that 's another story ) . When I was a kid , I 'd watch Bewitched and wish for the ability to turn myself pretty and blond . As I grew older and married ( my true hell on earth ) , I 'd wish for the ability to ban housework forever . I was never meant to be a domestic servant , especially after a ten-hour day at the office . Cows should be domestic servants , not women , do n't you think ? I wanted to break free . Be somebody I never was . You know Buffy , Xena , Joan of Arc ? Saving the world is for the pantywaisted . Me ? I want to rule it . Who am I ? Call me V. Which publicist/designer couple have hit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are sharing separate quarters and that she has been seen on the arm of a well-known piano player . True love , revenge , or PR scam ? Only the piano man knows for sure . I predict big things for the Hollywood starlet opening on Forty-second Street in August . Her voice , her moves , it 's the best thing she 's done in ages . You heard it here first , darlings . Fifth Avenue 's most daring bag lady and her darling designers have done it again . Current buzz on the street says that the It Bag for the spring season is part of the Sonata line from V. V. Yup , that 's me . Now I own aprosperous leather shop on Fifth Avenue , and I 'm not going to name names , because the purpose of anonymity is to stay anonymous . Every day celebrities waltz into the store , celebrity wannabes bumbling right after them . All to buy my bags . It 's a hell of a rush , and I like to have fun with it every now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) If you shop on Fifth Avenue , you 'll really appreciate this one . Here 's the drill : " Are you looking for something special today ? " I ask . " I 'm not sure , " the customer says in that Botoxified highbrow tone that tells me she wants me to compliment her on her new $1,500 Viktor &; Rolf knockoff and then find a bag to match . Do these people never learn ? " I 've got just the thing , " I tell her , and then , in my head , I say the magic words : Baggara , faggara , haggara , fine , puce is what you need to shine . Immediately her eyes zoom in on the puce monstrosity that is sitting behind the counter . We 've discounted it 47 percent , solely because it 's an ugly mother and no one would ever touch it . " I love it , " she gushes . I smile and rack up the price 200 percent . Ka-ching . After the Page Six item , I take in orders for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wonder how hype starts ? I 'm telling you , it 's all in who you know . You see those names that get paraded around and become forty-seven-minute celebrities ? Well , if you see a certain ex-hooker at mass , I 'm telling you it 's a sham . As long as she 's banking the advances and fighting off the West Coast producers with a diamond-studded stick , she 's got connections . That evening I take off for my usual night out . I signed over my soul to the devil almost two years ago , and I have n't regretted it yet . Having your every whim and desire  --  what 's not to love ? Pandemonium is a trendy little joint over on 1111 Legion Street . I 'm meeting Shelby and Meegan ( " two e 's , but pronounced Megan ; it 's a family name " ) , who belongs to one of the political dynasties from Connecticut ( who knew ? ) . Shelby is svelte , tall , with a deceptively casual blond cut . Her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed by Oreos and Ex-Lax . A deadly combination . Meegan is much less disciplined , a bluestocking with no sense of style at all who I had met one day while getting a facial . I promised Lucy I 'd get them both in the Life Enrichment Program , and now it 's up to me to show them the infinite rewards of my life . Oh , yeah , like that 's a tough job . To be perfectly honest , I do n't care too much for Shelby . It 's tougher to be apathetic about Meegan . She is genuinely nice , in a way I do n't even begin to understand . We 've talked a few times , and I 'm feeling the disconnect . I 've never spent a lot of time around nice people ; that 's what happens when you grow up in Hoboken . I walk into the bar , and heads turn . Men like the lean , Dolce &; Gabbana " You can look , but you have to sell your firstborn in order to touch " - clad body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart out , New York . One of the Yankee ballplayers is holding court in the back , and I wink , but do n't go any further . I 'm a Mets fan , and it seems disloyal . Someday , when I get to be a Level 7 and earn my behavior-modification status , the Mets are going to win the pennant . I find Meegan and Shelby near the wall in the back . I 've been trying to teach them to be bolder , more aggressive , but that 's easy when you have no reason to fear rejection . " Evening , ladies , " I say , picking up the martini the bartender has magically provided . It 's a good life . " V "  --  she did n't actually say " V , " but it 's really important that no one knows my real name ( Life Enrichment Clause Number 473 )  --  " you look fabulous ! " We do the air-kiss thing , and Meegan gives me an arm squeeze . My cell phone rings , and I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish it out . Caller ID indicates that it 's Harry , and I consider him for only a moment . Then I shake my head and put the phone back in my bag with a little moue . " Voice mail will get it . I 'm with two of my favorite friends , and besides , who needs a man anyway ? " Shelby 's eyes sharpen with greed . She is close ; I know it . I get extra powers for each client I recruit ( Life Enrichment Clause Number 10478 ) , and I have been just itching for my next level , mind-reading , aka the Amazing V Sees All . There 's an art to the program , a stealthy give-and-take , and you never ever share the secret until the absolute moment of desperation strikes . Neither Meegan nor Shelby knows anything , although Shelby will soon . She 's about to hit the wall . I can tell . With Meegan , well , let 's just say she 's not really the desperate type . Yet . I push back my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woe is me " wellspring of breath . " The shop was brutal today , " I say , and then pause for effect . " There was a leak in the Post about the new line , and the waiting list has already started . Julia 's assistant called and offered me five thou to put her at the top of the list . " I roll my eyes to indicate my perpetual ennui . " Can you believe it ? Like I could be bought , " I scoff . " A new line ? " asks Meegan . " Yes , Paolo has been busy . It 's to die for . " Paolo is my mentor , the one who recruited me . He had been the fabbest leather designer in Italy and got promoted to New York as part of the package for me . It is a big ego trip to think that my soul was worth a move to New York . I do n't know what made me so special , but I give thanks every day because of it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lean in close and smile . " I 'll get you the first one . " And there it is . I can see it in her eyes . I have her , and all it cost me was a fucking leather purse . Sad . I do n't like Shelby , but I think I would have wished more for her . " You 're the best , " she says , joy in her voice . " We 'll do lunch tomorrow , " I answer , not disputing it at all . I 'll arrange for Lucy to be there . The paperwork and the legal hocus-pocus can take up to two hours , but the 1040 EZ ( Lucy took great amusement in naming that one ) is available for those in a hurry . Shelby looks to be in a hurry . Meegan starts making eyes at a broker against the back wall . My gaydar is beeping overtime , but she is n't on the same wavelength . " I think he likes you , " I say , just as a conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks hesitant , but lonely , so she moves in his direction . I twitch my nose ( purely show business , but it lends an air of mysticism ) , and the words just pop into my head . Hetero , Homeo , higgledy hurl , forget your preference and go for the girl . Immediately he turns and gives her a long once-over . His companion looks a little startled , and I giggle to myself . Just like a man . Give him a heat-seeking missile , and he 'll follow it anywhere . After a short five minutes of chitchat , Meegan and her new convert are heading out the door , arm in arm . I take a long draw on my martini . Doing the magic takes a lot of energy , and I get a little sapped , but soon the alcohol is coursing through my veins , reviving the blood flow . " She bagged him , " I say with a satisfied smile . " Lucky her , " replies Shelby , bitchily . " Ah , every dog has its day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm being petty and small-hearted , are n't I ? " she asks , completely insincere . " That 's what Prozac is for , darling , " I drawl , patting her hand . We share a moment of awkward insincerity as I contemplate my soon to be ESPness and Shelby contemplates her aloneness . I spot him before Shelby does . An eleven-point buck in the patent-pending Armani suit . It 's the shoes that do me in . Italian wing tips . I have a severe sweet tooth for Italian wing tips . Some sort of postseventies Richard Gere fetish , I suppose . He meets my eyes , and I feel nothing . However , I figure it 's time for Shelby to get some sport . A kind of last hoo-haw , as it were . I give him a wink that he wo n't remember  --  I do like playing God  --  and chant to myself . It occurs to me belatedly that I really should n't give over all my spells to the general populace , however , I will say it involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dip . ' Nuff said . ( But you know , I have a tendency for prolixity , so I bet I slip up in the future . Shoot me . ) Mr. Wing Tips locks on to her , and the rest is history . They talk for a good forty-five minutes at the bar , comparing names ( which neither know , but it is the ultimate game of social chicken ) and complaining about the crowds at Pravda . The conversation turns racy , and I stop listening in . Eventually , they leave . After I finish my fourth martini , Meegan returns , flying solo . " What happened ? " I ask , mildly curious . Meegan begs a cosmopolitan from the bartender and sips . " I do n't know . It was so great at first . He was Mr. Attentive , talking about how pretty I was and how refreshing it was to meet a woman who seemed so genuine , and then we 're kissing , and then he gets this horrified look on his face , and ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " My playing-God tendencies develop feelings of guilt , and I 'm wondering if Lucy ever messes up . Probably not ; I do n't think Lucy was born in Jersey . " No , it 's not you . I bet he dropped some bad acid or something . " Do people do that anymore ? I 'm not sure , but does it really matter ? " I 'm being punished , " Meegan says , sounding absolutely sure of herself . And usually she 's so ... not . Ah , I say to myself , a mystery 's afoot . " Have you been bad ? " I pry , because the notion that Miss Milquetoast Meegan might be laden with pepper is just  --  delicious . " My mother died in a car accident . " A car accident ? That is so not me . Some people handle death well . I , however , have a bad case of necrophobia . It 's quite logical when you consider it . " Must be awful , " I say , with what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better actor than I give myself credit for , because she continues : " I was in high school , and we were having a huge fight that night . I wanted to go to a weekend party at one of my friends ' summer house , and she said no . I told her I wished she were dead . Then there was a big flash of light and this crash . " At this point , I nod politely and grimace . She takes a swallow and stares off into space , and I 'm thinking we 're done . Gee , no , I 'm wrong . " I was seriously banged up , and the doctors had to remove a lot of my insides . When I woke up from surgery , they told me she was dead . " It 's a heartbreaking story , but I 've gone through my entire sensitive repertoire , and serious panic is starting to take hold . I take a long sip of my drink to avoid having to say anything understanding , soothing , or empathetic , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know what I want now ? More than anything else ? " she says with a dead laugh . Then she 's looking up at me , and I realize that she wants me to ask . " I want a kid , " she says , stealing a cocktail napkin and tearing it up . Okay , this is better . Again with the disconnect , but I can work with this one . " Babies are nice . " " I ca n't have any kids of my own . Ever . It 's payback , is n't it ? " And now we 're talking about infertility . I look around for the nearest exit . Meegan buries her head on the bar . " Can I have another drink ? " It 's about damn time . " Bartender ! " I say , and whoosh , a cosmopolitan appears . Slowly Meegan lifts her head , appearing eerily calm . I wait , hoping she 's all talked out . However , there is a glint in her eye , and I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , " she says . " To be pregnant . To feel a life growing inside me . And I ca n't .... " Awkwardly I pat her head . It 's the best I can do in the circumstances . She starts inspecting the men at the bar , and I know that look . Every woman knows that look when it 's closing time and you 're drunk . " Maybe you should go home . Sleep it off , " I say , doing my best to rescue what is left of her family values and maybe recruit her into the Life Enrichment Program . " She thought I was Miss Perfect . I never wanted to be Miss Perfect . " There 's a certain irony in this moment . Why is it that women are never satisfied ? She does n't want to live her perfect life in that perfect house in Connecticut , and I would have sold my soul to do just that . " So do n't be Miss Perfect , " I say , because I 'm not Miss Perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You just have to give in when the Warrior Goddess strikes you . Meegan is no longer listening to my advice , which is probably a good thing . She stands up , a little woozy , but she 's still got that loose-cannon glint . So much for Dr. V 's Philosophy of Life . I console myself with my drink . " I think I need to go . Thank you for inviting me , " she says politely , because she is Miss Perfect and will always be . " Uh , sure . Anytime , " I add . Then I watch as she takes off through the non-smoked-filled bar , and I sit there alone , slowly getting drunk . Crises are not for the faint of heart . I 've had my share , and that 's too much . Give me the even keel of a carefree existence any day . Eventually , my naturally cool demeanor returns , and I get approached by a publicist from Susan Magrino , a castoff from JP Morgan , and a lesbian from Soho . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring . You would too , if you had my life . Just let me know , I 'll have Lucy give you a call . I meet Shelby the next day at the Gotham Bar and Grill . When Lucy 's not writing the world 's dishiest gossip at her Sixth Avenue office , she 's there . An office-away-from-office , as it were . I have my suspicions about the chef here , but with the whole Life Enrichment Program , there 's a high level of anonymity . It lends to the air of exclusivity ; that 's why , for instance , I am " V , " and " Shelby " is , well , " Shelby . " Anywhoo , back to the program , which is , of course , the important thing . Absolutely no riffraff allowed . You never know who 's doing deals , and it 's a great bit of sport to try and figure it all out . In fact , there 's a special bookie down in the meat-packing district who takes bets . I put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 2033 , or at least that 's what the oddsmakers are saying . I walk over to Lucy 's table ( I was scheduled fifteen minutes before Shelby ) and seat myself . The matre d ' looks offended . Save it for the pope , pal . She is stunning , as you might guess . Black hair , dark eyes , sort of an eternal Catherine Zeta-Jones look , only a little sharper . She has two cell phones ( those cool kind with digital cameras ) , which are perpetually ringing . She looks up from her conversation and smiles . Lucy 's actually pretty down-to-earth when you get to know her . Just do n't get on her bad side . You 've heard the stories ; they 're all true . I order a Pellegrino and sip patiently . Eventually she kisses into the phone and hangs up . " My God , can you believe the day I 'm having ? Oh , the UN . Those poor , misguided souls . What I could do for world peace if they 'd just give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his usual hijinks . I have an in , though , so I 'm hoping to seal that deal shortly . " I try not to look impressed , but it 's hard . Some of my old gaucheness can spring up at the most inopportune times . I murmur a simpatico , " Sounds like hell . " And she laughs . Lucy hears a lot of that . " Well , so tell me about Shelby . I 've got all the paperwork here . " She pats the birkin , and her phone rings , a digitally modified " MacArthur Park . " Lucy is a huge Donna Summer fan . " Hello , Don . " She lip-synchs his full name to me . Because Lucy has the hottest nine column-inches in New York , everybody wants to be a part of it , and her phone is ringing all the time . " Yes , yes . I 've heard all about your troubles with rehab , " she continues . " Poor dear . " Of course I can fix it , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A very classic moue that would do Revlon proud . " Too bad . Call me tomorrow if you change your mind . " She hangs up and smiles with confidence . " We 're running a little tidbit on Page Six tomorrow about rumors surrounding his ' vacation . ' He 's supposed to be at a spa in Arizona . " Lucy laughs . " When will people learn that lies will always come out ? Oh , well , maybe he 'll come around before the paper goes to bed . " She dabs at her lipstick with the cloth napkin and then folds it into a perfect replica of a swan . " Now , back to Shelby . You 've got her ? " I nod . " I 'll let you explain the rules , but she 's ready . " " You never disappoint me , V. " I smile at her , because I know . I sold my own soul almost two years ago , and my life has n't been the same  --  and trust me , that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned thirty-eight , I was driving down the turnpike , my average daily commute to my average daily job to my average daily life , and I screamed . No one could have heard it from the soundproofed doors in my trusty Toyota ( and trust me , you do n't open your windows in Newark ) , but I was done being Wilhelmina Lohman , bending over for every dick and dickina that came along . For me , that was it , and once I finally made up my mind , I was happier than I 'd ever been before . Part of the deal is the soul-recruitment program . Shelby is my third soul-taking , and I 'm getting the hang of it . The first two were relatively easy , an assistant DA I had met at a party and the super to my old building ( yes , there is justice in the world ) . I should be feeling an attack of conscience , some twinge of badness , but I do n't . Of course , I really do n't like Shelby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've closed that chapter of my life because , well , to be honest , it pales when compared to fawning friends and high-fashion extravaganzas . And there are bigger things ahead . This is the end of that sort of sentimental schmaltz . I look Lucy in the eye . No doubts here . For just a second , I see a smudge in her mascara , and then whoosh  --  it 's gone like I never saw it at all . Instinctively I reach for my mirror , check my reflection , but everything 's in order . No smudges , no smears , everything is beautiful . " You do n't need to doubt yourself , V. The world is your oyster , and you , my darling , are the pearl . I see great things in your future . You have to trust me on this . " Pinch me , I 'm think I 'm dreaming . And then Shelby comes through the door and spots us at the back . She looks a little stunned . Lucy does that to people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , all packaged in a neat size two . Shelby waits for the maitre d ' ( I 'm much more pushy than she is ) and smiles at him politely . I perform the introductions and listen as Lucy begins the Talk . I guess she treats everyone special , because Shelby gets a different spin than I got . Lucy tells Shelby how lucky she is to have such an orderly life , how she is saved from the rigors of the cause clebre . I 'm scanning the annals of my meager French vocabulary and think Lucy 's just making that one up , but it sounds good , and Shelby is entranced . Next comes the pitch . The surprised , " Oh , you actually want the fame and notoriety ? " The thoughtful stare up to the ceiling . " Well , there might be a way . " Shelby 's intensity is palpable , a chokehold that wo n't let go until your soul is free . Fascinated , I watch the whole interchange . There 's profound human drama at work when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same hell and insecurities that I did makes me realize how I have grown and matured . Today , I 'm above all that shit . Shelby takes a sip of her drink every now and then , or picks at her salad , but her eyes never leave Lucy 's face . Whatever you want , whatever your dreams are . Heady words . Eventually , I get seduced as well , forgetting to critique Lucy 's approach . I 'm sucked back into the sumptuous reverie of getting whatever you want . I 'll repeat that because it 's important . Whatever you want . Those are the dreams that fire the greed of the world . My back starts tingling , and I look around . Eyes are watching us , some surreptitiously , some openly . Appraising and envious , all blended together in one ugly palette of emotion . It 's a proud moment for someone who used to be a perpetual Z-lister , but that was a long time ago . Back before I was footloose and soul-free . Shelby is ready to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy is n't quite done yet . She rests her chin on her hand and tilts her head in a darling Audrey Hepburn-esque manner . " I do n't want you to do anything you 'll regret . There 's no backing out . Ever . What I try and give my clients is life without conscience . Who needs all that guilt ? I mean , really . " She focuses her whole attention on Shelby , oddly intimate in the bustling setting . At this moment , I do n't exist , the restaurant does n't exist , there 's only two people left in the world . Shelby and Lucy . And I 'm watching the tableau , waiting with bated breath for Shelby to condemn herself to a finite , yet boundless , life . Lucy taps her fingers on the papers . " You 're sure ? " she asks . Shelby nods . Lucy continues . " We do ask for a few things in return . I 'm a firm believer in rewarding positive behaviors . So , for each client you recruit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next level . There are nine levels , and you begin an apprentice program under V 's tutelage for thirty days . We do ask that you use your powers with discretion . The system works best if the world is n't aware we exist . " " What sort of powers ? " Shelby asks with such repressed malice that I wonder who is going to be the recipient of the seven plagues of Shelby . " You start with non-life-forms object creation . Basically , it 's our most effective program . If Wishes Were Birkins . After you recruit another client , you move into Level 2 , personal appearance modification , aka My Salad Days Are Over . " Shelby turns on me . " That 's how you do it ! " I smile with teeth that are perfectly white and have never been capped . Hate me , I do n't mind ; I never was hate-worthy when I had a soul . " All those wasted hours at the gym . Poof ! And dessert , all the dessert you want ... " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her eyes start to glaze . " What 's the third level ? " Lucy points to the paper in front of her . " I ca n't tell you the rest until you 've signed . We have to have a nondisclosure agreement in place with all our clients . " While Shelby signs , Lucy brings out the Life Enrichment handbook  --  I 've Sold My Soul to the Devil ... Now What ?  --  and gives it to Shel . " You can take it home and pore over the details . If you have any questions , V is there to answer them for you . And remember , it 's our little secret . " Lucy 's phone rings , and she takes the call away from the table . I 'm alone with my new convert . And after the requisite seventy-two hours ( not quite standard contract law , but still a nice touch  --  you have three days to back out of the deal . After that , you 're in forever ) , my power base will be upped to Level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can just think about something , and then , voil , there it is ? " I nod , feeling a lot like Santa . It 's a good life . " Well , sorta . You have to use a spell , and then it 'll appear . " She looks as if she 's about to wish up an entire wardrobe from Barney 's right there , and I hold up my restraining hand . " Wait . Remember . Discretion . " Her face scrunches with worry . " Oh . " Karan schmaran , heels of air , Edmundo Castillo is everywhere . " Look under the table , " I say , with all the finesse of Harry Houdini . It never gets old . She lifts the tablecloth and pulls out the signature Bergdorf-Goodman shopping bag . Inside is a wished-up pair of Edmundo Castillo sandals . " I want to do it , " she says . Feeling benevolent , I nod and point to the Frequently Asked Questions in the back , which includes a list of the most common spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic wash over her . Clients get an almost physical glow , which comes from the four-alarm , multi-orgasmic wash of having your wish granted  --  immediately . She squirms in her seat and then reaches under the table . I 'm curious to see what her first wish fulfillment is . Your most secret desire is a cornerstone in understanding and undermining the human psyche . Proudly she brandishes a set of Tiffany Feathers earrings . Personally , I think they 're gaudy , but I know better than to say anything . So silently I watch as she absorbs the change in her status . An instant becoming . She sits straighter , more self-assured than ever before , and there are no spells at work for that one . We celebrate over two pieces of chocolate cake ( Alfred 's secret recipe ) and a cappuccino . Lucy comes back in a whiff of custom-designed perfume , something mysterious and musky , as old as the world , then she waves good-bye and departs for places unknown . All eyes follow in her wake . I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us above a cheap imitation of life . Shelby and I toast her new soul loss , and she smiles in an almost drunken fog . Today I can rule the world . Well , okay , I 'm only an almost Level 4 . But someday ... After all , what good is a soul ? Can you borrow against it ? Dress it up and parade it down Park Avenue ? I feel the eyes gravitate in our direction once more , and I brush back my hair , a modest gesture to acknowledge the silent tributes that are flowing our way . Just remember , you can have it , too .
