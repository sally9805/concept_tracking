Chapter One FREDDY FUNKHOUSER FREDDY T. FUNKHOUSER stood at the door of the Burger Castle and scratched his ear , which was a little difficult since he was wearing a chicken costume . He rubbed his beak and practiced his clucking as he waited for customers . His father , Alfred Funkhouser , insisted that Freddy greet each customer that came into the Funkhouser family 's restaurant with a welcoming " cluck-cluck . " " Pow-pow-pow ! " said Alfred Funkhouser as he rolled by on skates , dressed in his tomato costume , shooting seeds from the automatic seed shooters attached to his forearms . The seed shooter was one of Alfred 's many strange inventions . " Take cover , incoming . Ack-ack-ack ! " cried out Alfred as he fired all over the place . " Better save the ammo for the paying customers , Dad , " Freddy said as he patiently picked the tiny seeds off his wings . " Right-O , Freddy . How many customers have we had today ? " " That would be , like , zero , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flounced by in her ketchup-bottle costume . An aspiring actress , the tall , skinny Nancy Funkhouser flounced dramatically everywhere , swishing her flaming red hair this way and that . Shehad a large trunk of costumes in her bedroom she had gotten from an old theater and dressed up in crazy outfits all the time . She constantly spouted dialogue from plays , movies , TV , and commercials . " O Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou , Romeo ? " cried out Nancy to an invisible audience . The five Guacamole brothers , who worked at the restaurant dressed as French fries , looked up , sniggered , and went back to their card playing and magazine reading . " Cluck-cluck , " replied Freddy , staring at his sister and tapping his beak with his left wing . " Cluck-cluck , here I am , O Nanny Boo-Boo . Herefore art I am . " Freddy and his Dad sometimes called her " Nanny Boo-Boo " because when he was very little , Freddy would run to his big sister when he got hurt and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nine years old now , Freddy still called her that when he wanted to make her mad . He considered making his sister miserable one of the most important jobs he had , because she certainly tried to make his life miserable every chance she got . " Hmmpph , " she snorted . " You 've ruined my concentration . I ca n't possibly work under these conditions , " she complained . " You 're not working right now , " pointed out Freddy . " Duh . We do n't have any customers . They 're all over there cramming dead cows into their mouths . " Nancy pointed her bottle top across the street to the enormous and fancy burger restaurant owned by the Spanker family . Patty Cakes , which served everything from burgers to cakes , was far more than a restaurant . The place had its own Ferris wheel , roller coaster , splash rides , movie theater , video arcade , and lots more . Their competitor 's sign had a large plastic charcoal hamburger patty sitting on top of a pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the staff uniforms to advertisements in the paper to the Patty Cakes blimp that glided all over town . The Spankers drove a big pink Cadillac that played the ditty : " Patty-cake , patty-cake , Spanker man , follow us , follow us to Spanker Land . " It made Freddy want to puke every time he heard it . " Beef - it 's what 's for dinner , " said Nancy dramatically , and then fell to the floor in a moving death scene before standing and taking a bow . " Thank you , thank you , " she murmured . " No , no encore , really , not another encore , my adoring fans . Fifteen is enough . Well , perhaps just one more . " Freddy could only shake his head . Of fifty million sisters he could have had , he got her . He said , " I 've performed a rigorous calculation and concluded that the fat and sodium content of a number six deluxe special at Patty Cakes is equal to eating four fatted calves and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words when he talked about scientific stuff . " Right-o , Freddy , " agreed his father . " I 've made the same calculation . Not very healthy fare . " " But that 's why everyone goes there , Dad , " explained his daughter , " because it 's bad for you and grease tastes good . " She performed a little tap dance and squirted ketchup out of her costume 's head . " Good to the last drop , " she recited to her adoring fans . " It does n't taste half as good as Dad 's soybean and tofu burgers or carrot and eggplant hot dogs , " Freddy shot back . " Or how about the fat-free fries that make your hair grow ? " Alfred Funkhouser piped in , " And do n't forget the Vroom shakes , which increase brain cell function fourteen-and-a-half percent on average , according to my latest tests . " He searched the pockets of his tomato costume . " Now where did I put those results ? " " Well , the **31;27;TOOLONG doughless pizza gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they invented air fresheners for , dear , " said her father . " What we need , " said Freddy , " is to get the word out and let people know about us . The Spankers have commercials all the time on TV , and they have people passing out coupons on all the streets . We should be doing that too . " " You doof ! All that costs money - money we do n't have , " said his sister . " That 's just not fair . Our food is lots better than theirs , and it 's good for you too . " " That 's why our float in the Founders ' Day parade is so important , " Alfred said . " It 'll help to remind everyone in town about the Burger Castle . " " It 'll be the best float ever ! " shouted Freddy . " I 've been working on something top secret in my lab for it . " " What is it ? " asked his father . " I ca n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy said , " I thought I 'd act out all the plays of Shakespeare while we 're driving along the parade route . You know , to give the crowd something really special . " Her father scratched his chin . " All of Shakespeare 's plays , Nanny Boo-Boo ? Umm , the parade route 's not that long . " " Dad , my name 's Nancy , remember ? " she scolded . " Do n't worry , I 'm going to talk really fast . And you never know ; I might even get discovered along the way . " " Discovered ? Like by the people from the nuthouse ? " piped in Freddy . " Does that mean I can have your room when they take you away in the straitjacket with duct tape over your mouth ? " " Hmmpph , " said Nancy as she flounced away with a squirt of ketchup aimed at her little brother . A few minutes later Freddy walked outside to inspect the Burger Castle sign that hung across the front of the restaurant . The project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sign , and studying the sign helped him think about how the float design should look . The Burger Castle had once been a Laundromat made to look like an old castle complete with drawbridge and turrets . When the Funkhousers bought it , the turrets were sagging like frowning faces and its walls were crumbling . The floors were uneven , the doors did n't open , and there were few windows . It was very dark inside . The tall , thin Alfred Funkhouser had rubbed his sharp chin as he stared at the grand wreck for the first time . He then whipped out a level and plumb line and , using a thingamabob that looked like something very dangerous if it were thrown at you , he made a calculation . " It 's three-quarters of an inch from total collapse . It 's perfectly perfect ! " he proclaimed , putting a hand through his jet black hair and rubbing a spot off his glasses . He and the kids spent the next year fixing it up , complete with working drawbridge , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugging the turrets . No other restaurant in America looked quite like the Burger Castle . Freddy loved it . And yet almost no one ever came to eat there unless it was by accident . But the project he was now working on for the Burger Castle float would change all that . He looked at the sign again . On either side of the words " Burger " and " Castle " were big French fries . In his secret lab , Freddy had constructed giant Fries using his father 's super-secret potatoes . Then he gave them faces , painted them fun colors , and rigged them with wires and a small battery so that with a press of a button they would wave their hands and bob their heads while they were on the float . He had even thought of a way , using a loudspeaker and an electronic gizmo he 'd built , to make the Fries appear to be talking . They would tell everyone to come to the Burger Castle . With the addition of the talking Fries , and some other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lock to win the float competition . Freddy 's dream was to become a famous scientist , like his father had been . Alfred Funkhouser had worked for the U.S. Government and won lots of awards for his work . But after Freddy 's mother passed away when Freddy was three years old , his father left his job and moved them to the farm so he could spend more time with his children . Freddy believed that his father should still be a big-shot scientist in Washington , D.C. , but if his father could n't be , then Freddy would do it for him . Freddy looked over at Patty Cakes again , and then at the big warehouse that the Spankers owned next to their restaurant . Even from here Freddy could hear the sounds of machinery , sawing , and hammering . He watched as a big forklift carried a large wooden thing into the warehouse . Curious , Freddy slipped off his chicken costume and sneaked across the street to the warehouse . A side door to the building was slightly ajar , so Freddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the middle of the warehouse it looked like they were building a replica of the Patty Cakes . Dozens of workers were hammering , nailing , painting , and sawing . The thing that Freddy had seen the forklift bring in was part of the Ferris wheel . It was now being lowered onto one end of the float . For that 's what this was , Freddy was convinced : the Patty Cake float for the Founders ' Day parade . In a far corner Freddy saw Stewie Spanker , the owner of Patty Cakes , and also the town of Pookesville 's police chief and mayor , talking with a well-dressed , short , blond-haired man with a skinny mustache whom Freddy had never seen before . They were going over what looked to be plans for the float . A depressed Freddy walked back to the Burger Castle and put his chicken costume on . They did n't have a chance against the Spanker float . All the work he 'd done was worthless . Colorful Fries that smiled and bobbed their heads and said stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Freddy cried out , and grabbed his arm that had just turned red . He looked over and paled . Coming across the drawbridge was Adam Spanker and his gang of bullies . They had their fancy paintball guns and wore Army helmets and camouflage uniforms and big black boots . Adam Spanker had been Freddy 's worst nightmare for years . One of his legs was larger than Freddy 's chest . His stomach was so big that it was rumored he had actually swallowed a whole person . His hair was cut so short he looked bald . Some kids at school said Adam 's mother was a witch who had taken all his hair when he was born and used it to make poisons . Other kids said that Adam had green blood - a sure sign of a monster . " Cluck-cluck , Funky Funkhouser ! " roared Adam Spanker . Freddy 's teeth chattered uncontrollably . " Yo ... you 're ... you 're tre ... tress ... tresspa ... passing , " said Freddy . " We ... we ... we 're tre ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I just saw you poking around our place , Funky . " " I was n't doing anything . " " Yeah , right . " Adam looked slyly at his gang . " Well , boys , now that we 're here , we might as well go into the old burger dump . " " But you never buy anything . And I ... I ... think ... " Freddy stopped . " Just spit it out , you little nerd , " bellowed Adam . Freddy swallowed a big lump in his throat and said quickly , " I think you 're just coming here to engage in clandestine operations with a subversive purpose . " Adam looked totally confused until one of his gang whispered in his ear . Adam marched up to Freddy towering over him . " Are you calling me a spy ? " he snarled . Freddy looked around at all the big kids with paint guns staring at him , and his teeny bit of courage melted right away and into the Vroom shake moat . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean , uh - " " You got something you want to say to me , say it man to man , Funky , " yelled Spanker , his big hands balled into fists . Freddy desperately wanted to be brave and stand up to Adam , and he would have , except he was scared to death . " Uh , I ... I said ... cluck-cluck , welcome to the Burger Castle . " Adam pointed his paintball gun at Freddy . " Welcome to the Burger Castle what ? " " Uh , welcome to the Burger Castle ... Mr. Spanker ? " " That 's better . Come on , men , let 's check out the burger dump . " As he passed by Freddy , Spanker shot out a big , doughy hand and pushed Freddy into the moat . The gang roared with laughter and then swarmed into the Burger Castle . Freddy swam to the side of the moat and got out . He wrung his chicken feathers dry and hurried into the Burger Castle to see what the Spanker gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . " Stop that right now ! " yelled Nancy before she was hit in the face by a blue paint splotch . She raised both her hands up and said in a loud , deep voice , " Whosoever shall smite me with another blow shall reap the unstoppable force of all that is good and right . " Then she was smote with a purple paint splotch right in the nose and dove behind the sales counter screaming , " I shall live to fight another day ! " The Guacamole Brothers had scattered when the Spanker gang had attacked . On their way out the back door they yelled in unison , " We quit ! " Alfred rolled out of the back in his tomato costume and said , " Now , you boys stop that right now or I 'll be forced to call the chief of police . " Adam shot Alfred in the butt with a green paint splotch . " Go ahead and call him , " crowed Adam . " My Dad 's right across the street at our warehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Freddy snuck in the side door and started edging toward Adam . Right before he reached him Adam whirled around and drilled him with a shot . Freddy went flying backward , pink paint all over his beak . Adam and his gang stood triumphantly over their fallen foes . " Look , Funkies , " he said , " If I were you I 'd just pack up and leave town . Nobody comes to your crummy burger dump and nobody comes to the crummy farm you live on . There 's only room for one burger restaurant in this town . And that 's the Patty Cakes . " " Oh yeah ? " said Nancy . " Just wait until we win the float competition at the Founders ' Day parade . Then we 'll see who 's number one . " Adam laughed . " We 've won it five years in a row , and there 's nothing stopping us from number six . So the day you win the float competition is the day I turn fat and ugly . " " Gee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales counter where she was hiding . " Why do n't you just declare us the winner then ? " Adam looked at her in confusion until one of his gang whispered to him . Adam yelled out to Nancy , " Hey , did you just call me fat and ugly ? " " If the adjectives fit , oh meat-headed one , " she said . Adam looked at his gang . " All right , boys , time to show the Funkies who 's boss . Let 's give ' em the Deadly Dose . " The gang loaded fresh paintball bullets marked with skulls and crossbones in their guns and pointed them at the ceiling . " Do n't ! " yelled Alfred . He shot tomato seeds at them , but they bounced harmlessly off the gang . " Aim ! " said Adam . " Stop ! " screamed Nancy , squirting ketchup at them . Adam just licked it off his shirt . " Fire ! ! " " NOOOO ! " Freddy tried to run away , but his foot hit some wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , directly in front of the paintball guns as they fired . The paintballs hit him at the same time , covered him with a black ooze , and sent him flying up , up , up to the ceiling . " Retreat , men ! " barked Adam . " Mission accomplished . " The Spanker gang flew out the door . Alfred and Nancy watched Freddy shooting to the ceiling . He seemed to be moving in slow motion , his mouth open and one long scream coming out of it . " AAAAAHHHHHH ! " ( Continues ... )
