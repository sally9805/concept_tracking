<p> CORE , W.Va.  --  Every night , just before his coal-miner class begins , Ryan Boyd marks the date in his notebook . <p> Next to that , he writes " Levi Hunter , " the name he and his wife , Miranda , chose for their newborn boy . <p> " That reminds me why I 'm here , " says Boyd , 22 . <p> His training started Jan. 3 , one day after the explosion at the Sago Mine . The blast trapped 13 miners , and all but one died as the nation was riveted by the rescue effort . Yet Boyd and others are eager to take the same kind of jobs . <p> Coal , once derided as a dirty fuel , is hot . Demand for coal to fuel power plants is growing as oil and natural gas prices soar . So is demand for miners . After more than 20 years of dwindling opportunity , miners ' prospects are picking up . <p> The average age of miners in West Virginia is 55 , and many are considering retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s ; the industry employed nearly 63,000 West Virginians in 1978 . By 2003 , that figure dipped below 15,000 . <p> The 17 students in this class at West Virginia University 's Academy of Mine Training and Energy Technology are aware of coal mining 's hazards . They talk about the disasters that have killed 16 coal miners in the state since their class began . But the promise of family-sustaining wages  --  maybe $12 an hour to start , but rising quickly to an average of $64,000 a year  --  is enough to draw a new generation of West Virginians underground . <p> " Mining is the job that pays the most here , " Boyd says . " It puts food on the table and roofs over heads . " <p> He says he 's weighed the dangers of working hundreds of feet below a mountain with the threat of fires and cave-ins , but he considers the risks minimal . Accidents killed just three West Virginia miners in 2005 , and 12 in 2004 . <p> " You 're just as likely to get killed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 new coal miners across the USA to meet increasing demand and to replace retiring miners over the next 10 years , according to Luke Popovich , a spokesman for the National Mining Association . <p> Mines produced about a billion tons of coal every year for the past decade , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . And despite the push for alternative sources of energy , an idea President Bush promoted in his State of the Union speech , the agency forecasts that coal will generate 57% of the USA 's electricity in 2030 , up from 50% in 2004 . <p> Popovich predicts that records for production and consumption will be set this year . Coal use is forecast to continue growing for the next generation , according to the energy agency . Higher oil and natural gas prices are expected to lead to an increase in coal consumption , the agency says . <p> Cleaning up coal 's reputation <p> In the 1970s and ' 80s , the coal industry had a dirty reputation . Burning coal emits mercury , which can damage the nervous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with oxygen , it forms sulfur dioxide , which can fall to the Earth as acid rain . When burned , coal also gives off carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas that many scientists say is responsible for global warming . <p> Technology has mitigated some of those problems : Smokestack scrubbers remove some sulfur and mercury from coal emissions . The country 's growing appetite for energy has made coal more attractive . Unlike oil , coal is so readily available that the United States is n't dependent on foreign sources . The USA sits on the world 's largest coal reserves , enough to last more than 200 years at the current level of use , according to the energy information agency . <p> Coal suddenly has cachet . But there are n't enough miners to dig it up . <p> Most coal miners in West Virginia were hired during coal 's heyday after the Arab oil embargo in 1973 , says Jim Dean , director of WVU 's Mining Extension Service . <p> The decline of coal in the late 1970s and ' 80s meant that few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We lost an entire generation of coal miners , " Dean says . <p> " The miners hired during the last hiring boom are coming to the end of their careers , " says Tom Hall , one of Boyd 's instructors . " And we do n't have anyone to take their place . If you started in the mines at 20 , 25 years old , and you spent 30 , 35 years in mining , you 're ready to retire now . " <p> Two new training centers , sponsored by the state and the coal industry , held their first classes last month to help fill West Virginia 's thinning ranks of miners . The state will need as many as 7,000 new miners in the next 10 years , Dean says . He estimates that the placement rate for graduates will be better than 90% . <p> Enter Boyd <p> He lives in Morgantown , about 10 miles east of here , works as a cook and also does a little construction to help support his new family . His wife , Miranda , 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State University and is most of the way to a civil engineering degree . He plans to finish , but the opportunity to boost his family 's income quickly as a miner was too good to pass up . <p> Working underground , even for eight or 10 hours a day , wo n't bother him , he says . And the idea of using big , powerful equipment appeals to him as an engineer , and , frankly , as a guy . <p> " Breaking up rock is kind of cool and interesting to me , " he says . <p> But above all , a job in a coal mine means he can raise his family in the state he loves . <p> " I want to stay in West Virginia , " Boyd says . " I was born and raised here . I love West Virginia . My family all grew up here . I love the outdoors . Love to fish and hunt . Trout , deer , turkey . If it can be hunted , you can find it here . " <p> Handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Virginia is handsome , rugged country . Rivulets trickle off steep , snow-slick slopes into fast-running streams like the Buckhannon and Cheat rivers . <p> Joe Fluharty , whose father , grandfather , uncles and cousins all have mined coal , has visited other states . Tennessee 's pretty , he says , but the smog gave him a headache . <p> " I like the Mountain State  --  the hunting , fishing , skiing , " says Fluharty , 34 . " A lot of good people here . There 's clean air . I love this state . " <p> A mechanic who repairs electric motors , he says he 'll earn about the same money working as a miner . But he figures the benefits will be better , and several coal mines are close to his home in Mannington . <p> When Fluharty graduated from high school , he would have followed his father into the mines , but there were no jobs to be had then . <p> " The mining industry slump meant I did n't have a choice , " Fluharty says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his $200 tuition for the mining class the " best money I 've ever spent . " <p> Instructor Hall says a beginning miner , one whose red hard hat signifies his apprentice status , can expect to start out at $12 or $13 an hour . A miner with a black hard hat , one with six months and 108 shifts under his belt , may jump to $16 an hour . Foremen , electricians and other specialists earn more . <p> The average West Virginia miner made about $64,000 last year , according to Workforce West Virginia , part of the state 's commerce department . That 's more than twice the $31,000 average income for all industries in the state . Hall knows of one bulldozer operator at a coal mine who made , after bonuses and overtime , $118,000 last year . <p> " It 's almost sky 's the limit , " Hall says . <p> Now Boyd and Fluharty and the others are learning about equipment and safety . Class meets five nights a week for four hours . When they complete the course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires miners to have 80 hours of training before they can enter an underground coal mine as an apprentice . The federal requirement is 40 hours , or 24 hours for surface mining . Boyd and Fluharty will have 160 hours of training and be certified for both types of mining . <p> Tonight , Hall talks to them about mine fires . It 's a sensitive topic . As he lectures , rescue crews are searching for two men trapped by a coal mine fire in southern West Virginia . They will eventually be found dead . The explosion that killed 12 men at the Sago mine was just two weeks earlier . <p> The 17 men in class , most in their 20s and 30s , are sipping Mountain Dew , coffee or Dr Pepper . They follow Hall as he teaches them about fires and how to put them out . <p> " In a coal mine , gentlemen , it 's a life-or-death situation , is n't it ? " <p> Hall quizzes the class . How fast does an underground fire double in size ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Faith is a big thing ' here <p> Hall does n't dwell on it . The recent deaths are on people 's minds , but safety has improved greatly in recent years , he says . <p> " Most of the men are from this area , " Hall says . " They understand that people get killed or injured in the mines . We 'll discuss it with them to a certain degree . " <p> Boyd considers the point . He says there are going to be more accidents " like Sago . " But it does n't gnaw at him . <p> " Faith is a big thing for people here , " he says . " If it 's my time to go , it 's my time to go . The bottom of a coal mine might not be the place I choose to die , but if it happens , so be it . I 'm not afraid to work . " <p> His wife told him not to turn on TV news the day of the Sago Mine explosion  --  one day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " If I lived my life running from fear , " he told her , " I would n't to anything but sit in a padded room and drink from a straw . " <p> Fluharty says his 9-year-old daughter , Haley , told him , " Dad , I do n't know if I want you to go into the mines . " <p> " I said , ' Honey , hopefully they 'll teach me to be safe .
