In the Land of Second Chances By George Shaffner Random House George Shaffner The Sad Edge of a Slippery Slope My name is Wilma Porter . I own the Come Again Bed and Breakfast , which is the only B &; B in Ebb , Nebraska , and the only one in Rutherford B. Hayes County that is recommended by two Internet directories . I bought the place from Clement Tucker , our very own Warren Buffett , who contracted an acute case of Midlife Crisis about five years ago and decided to build himself a modern house with all the latest conveniences . The Come Again is a single-turreted , three-story Victorian mansion that was built by Silas Tucker the Second shortly after the Civil War . There 's a single , grand oak tree in the front that antedates the house and a black asphalt driveway leading up to a formal porte-cochere and a little parking area for my guests . Last year , I had the house painted bone white except for the roof , which is black . I think the contrast is meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister and Ebb 's most prominent recluse , occupies the entire third floor of the Come Again on a permanent basis . There are six bedrooms on the second floor . I live in the one that faces the back garden ; the other five are for rent . Each bedroom has its own bathroom ; the Cornhusker Suite even has a Jacuzzi . Downstairs , there 's a living room the size of a tennis court , a parlor for the TV , a den , which I keep for myself as a rule , and a giant-sized dining room that will seat sixteen . Except for my kitchen , which is commercial grade , the entire house is decorated in beautiful old antiques that Clem Tucker left behind or I bought cheap at estate auctions and refinished myself in the basement . Like most folks who live in Ebb , I was born right here , but about an hour after I got my high school diploma I jumped on a bus to North Platte . I came back with my two daughters after the divorce fifteen years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is up in Omaha and the other is over in Council Bluffs , across the river . By most measures , Ebb is a small town . It is the county seat , but only two thousand people live inside the city limits . There 's not a lot to do here most of the time , and that 's the way we like it . If we need some excitement , we can drive up to Lincoln . For twenty years , every politician in this area has been elected on the " No Wal-Mart , no how " platform . We take a similarly dim view of fast-food franchises , slow-food franchises , convenience-store franchises , and all other franchises with big , backlit signs in primary colors . The only exception is the new Starbucks on Main Street , but Ebb is so small that we only have the one . All the rest of the stores on Main are unique and most of them have been in operation for more than fifty years . The biggest and most famous is Millet 's , the last remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is pronounced like " mill-it " and not like " mill-ay , " sits right at the corner of Bean Street and Main , where it 's been ever since Joshua Millet opened it up back in 1920 . It has survived the Great Depression , rural flight , three bank bankruptcies , World War II , a flood , and God knows how many droughts and tornadoes . Now it is owned and managed by Calvin Millet , June and Joshua III 's only child . Calvin is a smart , hardworking young man , and everybody in Hayes County shops at his store as if it was a patriotic duty , but we 're all afraid that Millet 's will not survive his run of terrible bad luck . Calvin was a homely baby , bald and sort of wedge-headed , but he grew up to be tall and handsome in a gangly , fair-haired sort of way , kind of like Gary Cooper . He was too skinny to play high school football , a form of religion in these parts , but he studied hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's store . After graduation , he went up to Lincoln and got himself a four-year degree in accounting , and then he joined the Air Force to see the world . They sent him to Bossier City , Louisiana . Calvin had hardly been gone for any time at all when his parents were killed in a train accident . I could tell at the funeral that he had already started to lose his hearing . He 's fine now ; he wears tiny little hearing aids in both ears , but the Air Force had to give him a medical discharge so he came back home to run the family store . A year or so later , he married Mary Beth Tucker , Clem 's only child and a bit of an airhead , but a real beauty and the catch of the county from a financial point of view . Six months after that , Lucy was born . I know what you 're thinking , but the human gestation period in rural America is only six months for the first baby . After that , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , she contracted some sort of neurological disorder . I hear it 's similar to Lou Gehrig 's disease , but more aggressive and unnaturally painful . Anyway , a real sick daughter was more than her momma could handle , so she pulled up and left for L.A. Just disappeared in the middle of the night . Took the Jeep and the dog and the George Foreman cooker and left Calvin a note saying she was real sorry . Mary Beth 's departure caused quite a buzz at the Quilting Circle . Most of us are divorces ourselves , so we are n't inclined to be critical of any woman who leaves a man . In fact , we have a support system in place so that a woman can do it right : counselors , lawyers , day care , even police protection . But Mary Beth did n't use the system , and her husband and sick daughter suffered for it . She has n't been welcome in these parts since . Apparently , being a waitress to the stars was not keeping her in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home anyway but just long enough to sue Calvin for divorce . Since she had only abandoned her husband and sick child in the dead of night , and taken the dog and the Jeep to boot , the court was sympathetic to her predicament . Calvin now pays her alimony . In case you were wondering , the judge is married to a Tucker , once removed . Little Lucy Millet is the sweetest little blonde-haired girl you have ever seen and she is smart as a whip , but she is n't getting any better . For the last three years , Calvin has flown her all over the country looking for a doctor who can cure her , but all they 've done is slow the disease down and , according to rumor , empty the Millet bank account . Calvin has health insurance through the farmer 's co-op , just like everybody else in these parts , but most of Lucy 's treatments have been experimental , and that means that the HMO wo n't pay for them . Unless somebody gets those insurance companies under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water will count as a medical experiment before I 'm dead . The tornado hit last month while Calvin and Lucy were away at the Mayo Clinic . That was too early for tornadoes as a rule , but the weather has been unseasonably warm all year . Luckily , it was a tiny thing as twisters go . It missed the town and everything else in Rutherford B. Hayes County except for Rufus Bowe 's grain silo and Calvin Millet 's place . Actually , it tore the roof off of Rufus 's silo and dropped it on Calvin 's house -- dead center . I drove out to see what happened with my best friend , Loretta Parsons , who is Ebb 's sole resident black person and the owner of the Bold Cut Beauty Salon . Calvin 's home was a sight to see . It looked like a pile of rubble with a great big aluminum teacup sitting in the middle of it . You would n't think that anybody 's aim could be that good , not even God 's . After the tornado , Calvin and Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days until he found them a cracker-box of a house to rent in Carson , about fifteen minutes down the road toward the Kansas line . Calvin has n't talked to Buzz Busby about rebuilding yet , even though that place is so small and so far away from town . I would know for sure if he had . We 're all sad for Calvin Millet and worried sick about poor Lucy -- any caring person would be -- but I have to tell you the honest truth : we 're just as scared of rural America 's variety of the domino theory . If Calvin 's finances fall apart , then Millet 's Department Store will fail . If Millet 's goes under , then the county 's political resolve will collapse and we 'll get a Wal-Mart store one week later -- in a ravine ten miles from nowhere because the land will be dirt cheap . The next thing you know , everybody in the county will be shopping for bargains in the ravine , so Loretta will have to shut her doors , and so will the Starbucks and every other place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library . Then the girls wo n't bring their kids back after they get divorced and that will be the end of Ebb as we know it . You may think that I 'm exaggerating , but this town is perched on the sad edge of a slippery slope . I went to church and wished to God I could help in some way , but He sent us a salesman . That 's right , a salesman . At least that 's my theory . You be the judge .
