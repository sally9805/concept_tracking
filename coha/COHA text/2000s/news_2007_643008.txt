<p> What 's an investor to do ? Here are five ways to cope with surging volatility in your 401(k) account : <p> 1 . Do n't panic . <p> Investors yanked $12.3 billion from stock funds in August . Believe it or not , that 's nearly always a sign that the market is about to rise . The last time funds saw a net outflow of cash was in June 2006 . The Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index has gained 20% since then . <p> Instead , set an asset allocation  --  a mix of stocks , bonds and money market funds  --  that will help you sleep at night . The smaller your portion of stocks , the less volatile your portfolio is likely to be . But do n't be too cautious . The trade-off for low volatility is lower returns . <p> Take the Dow Jones Target 2020 index , a blend of several investment categories . Many 401(k) plans include target funds that mirror such indexes . The Dow Jones index  --  made up of 56% stocks , 40% bonds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.5% this year . By contrast , the Dow Jones Target 2040 index , is 90% in stocks ; it 's up 12.8% this year . <p> 2 . Rebalance . <p> One of the joys of 401(k) investing is that you can usually move money among your plan 's funds with no commissions and pay no taxes on your gains . <p> If you 've created an asset allocation that suits you , review your current weightings to make sure they 're still more or less where you want them to be . <p> Suppose , for example , you had decided to keep your 401(k) at 75% in stocks and 25% in bonds . If your stocks have since soared to 85% of your portfolio , consider trimming your stock holdings . <p> Aside from reducing the risk in your portfolio , rebalancing provides another benefit : You 'll be selling shares when they 're high and buying when they 're low . Which is exactly what you want to do . <p> Do n't bother rebalancing after every down day in the market . But if you rebalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of balance , you can boost your returns while reducing your risk . <p> 3 . Dump your company stock . <p> You may be working for a swell company with great growth prospects . Still , you should n't have more than 10% of your 401(k) assets invested in your company stock , particularly if you 're worried about volatility . <p> Why ? For one thing , you 've already invested your biggest asset  --  you  --  in the company . Your future earnings and , therefore , your future investments are riding on your company already . <p> But more important , an individual stock is , by definition , riskier than the overall market of thousands of stocks . Your company stock can , in theory , go to zero , as investors in Enron painfully discovered . Not all company stock is more volatile than , say , an S &P; 500 index fund . But any one stock is riskier than a basket of stocks . <p> 4 . Kick out poor performers . <p> If you have the choice of several different funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These funds are not only likely to deliver poor performance ; they may be more volatile as well . Fund companies often measure a manager 's performance by his or her three-year record . If the fund 's performance falls consistently below that of other similar funds , the manager will likely get the boot . <p> You should do the same . Find your fund 's ticker symbol and go to www.morningstar.com . You 'll be able to see how well , or poorly , the fund has fared against its peers . If you have a better choice , take it . <p> What if your 401(k) plan offers just one or two mediocre funds ? Hold your nose and stick with them . A study by Lipper , the mutual fund trackers , shows that in the long run , creating proper asset allocation is more important than magically selecting standout funds . <p> 5 . Put more money in . <p> Before you get too ticked off at your fund manager , bear in mind that the single biggest determinant of how much money you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions by 1% or 2% of your income will do more to increase your returns than any other move you make . <p> In the end , your 401(k) holdings probably performed well this quarter . But let 's not forget the stomach-churning ride it took to get there . By any measure , stock market volatility has been galloping at dizzying speeds . <p> Since 1950 , the Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index has posted a daily loss of more than 2% on an average of four days a year . Yet in just the past nine months , the S &P; 500 has posted daily losses of more than 2% six times . Or look at it this way : The Dow Jones industrial average gained or lost more than 1% on 24 days in the third quarter  --  the same number of times it did for all of 2006 . <p> If you 're feeling queasy from the leaps and plunges of your 401(k) account , brace yourself . The market 's gyrations are n't likely to slow anytime soon . <p> One reason : Historically speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 , says Russ Koesterich , head of investment strategy at Barclays Global Investors . <p> " Money was cheap and plentiful , and in that type of environment , volatility is usually low , " Koesterich says . The market is returning to more normal levels of volatility now . <p> There are plenty of factors out there to give the stock market the jitters . Start with the credit crunch , which triggered the Fed rate cuts and stirred the volatility pot . Worries about subprime mortgage defaults spread to the stock market , triggering a 3% drop in the S &P; 500 on Aug.9 and a 2.5% gain the next week , when the Federal Reserve lowered its discount rate to 5.75% . <p> But on Aug.28 , the market plunged 2.4% on fears that the Fed would n't lower the federal funds rate . On Sept.18 , the market threw a party for the Fed 's rate-cut announcement , soaring nearly 3%  --  its largest one-day gain all year . <p> Other factors that could send the stock market sharply up or down over the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pounding on international currency markets . The trade-weighted dollar index , which measures the dollar 's value against the largest U.S. trading partners , has fallen 6.2% since June . Measured against the euro , though , the dollar has tumbled 10% . It 's now slightly weaker than the Canadian dollar for the first time since 1977 . <p> *Oil . The price of a barrel of crude oil broke above $80 for the first time , surpassing ( on an inflation-adjusted basis ) its peak during the 1970s . <p> *The economy . The housing market sputtered , sparking fears that the economy could slip into a recession . And , says Sam Stovall , chief equity strategist for S &P,; volatility typically remains elevated for six months after the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates . <p> # Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
