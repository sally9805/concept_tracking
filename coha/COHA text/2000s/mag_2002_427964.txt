Are baggage and bad habits holding you back ? Discover how to break through and reach higher ground // I knew it was time to clean up my act last year when even my " fat clothes " did n't fit . I could no longer explain 25 extra pounds away as PMS-related bloating . I had started a new job and published a book , but with success came stress . After two years of working nights on the book in addition to my day job , frequent business travel , junk-food dinners , skipped workouts and skipped hours of sleep , I had piled on the pounds . So I resolved-again-to shed the weight . This time , however , I finally realized the gain was not just the result of a slowing metabolism ( a favorite excuse ! ) but of a toxic buildup of unhealthy lifestyle habits and unresolved stress . Can you relate ? With our busy lives , Black women barely have time to notice when our routines get out of balance . But the signs are all around us : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frequent visits to the doctor ( or forgoing regular checkups ) . " What 's toxic , " says personal-empowerment expert Debrena Jackson Gandy of Seattle , " is energy that 's stagnating and causing dis-ease . " Those poisonous patterns of living keep us stuck at an unhealthy weight , in a dead-end job or in unfulfilling relationships . Often we do n't notice until we 're in physical , emotional or relationship pain . // To heal the pain , we need a deep cleansing , a kind of holistic colonic . You can begin this cleansing process by making just one little change , because the mind , body and spirit are all interconnected , says holistic-health practitioner Queen Afua of Brooklyn . " When you start detoxifying the body , you begin to purify your mind and vice versa , " leading to an even bigger payoff , she notes . For instance , what started for me as a goal to lose weight-six pounds so far ! - has resulted in not only a more healthful diet but also in fewer toxic thoughts about my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate my shape. ) and increased self-esteem . It 's a sort of detox domino effect . Here are 15 ways to clear clutter , reduce stress , be good to your body and balance your life : DETOX YOUR BODY Our body rids itself of toxins naturally every time we exhale or sweat , says licensed acupuncturist and clinical nutritionist Patricia Fitzgerald in her book The Detox Solution ( Illumination Press ) . But a body that is overburdened by unhealthy foods , lack of water and inactivity cant do the job efficiently . The results ? Fatigue , colds , headaches , mood swings and chronic illness , to name a few . On the other hand , a healthier , cleaner lifestyle can help prevent disease , boost energy , curb food cravings and stabilize weight , making you look and feel wonderful . Get rid of excuses and get moving . " The boss needed it yesterday . " " The kids need a ride . " " Jog ? I can barely crawl after the day I 've had . " Yes , fitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can cross off feeling exhausted , asking the tailor to let out your skirts and losing your last good nerve . Exercise releases toxins through sweat . It also burns body fat , which can store toxins . Most important , it rewards you with increased energy , reduced tension and a greater sense of well-being . Whenever possible , try to schedule workouts in the morning , before other priorities push it off the edge of your schedule . Enjoy cardiovascular activities for a minimum of 20 minutes three or four times a week : Walk , take dance classes ( African dance , jazz , tap ) or bike at a moderate pace . Add weight or resistance training and flexibility exercises ( stretches , yoga ) for a complete program . ( Note : If you have n't exercised regularly in a while , check with your doctor first . ) Put down that soda . The sugar in pop poops you out . Java makes you jumpy . Alcohol , in excess , is just plain toxic . ( That 's why they call it intoxication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the way to go . Besides quenching thirst , water aids the kidneys and bowels in ridding the body of wastes . You can figure out how much water you need to drink each day by dividing your weight in half For example , a 150-pound woman needs at least 75 ounces , or nine eight-ounce glasses , per day . Not drinking enough water can lead to fatigue , a dull complexion and even weight gain ( because we often mistake thirst for hunger ) . Chronic dehydration also exacerbates illnesses such as high blood pressure and asthma . So drink up . Hate the taste ? Try bottled water with a splash of lime or lemon , flavored sparkling water or decaf herbal tea . Trash the junk foods . Often the way we eat under stress causes more stress . A diet tipped toward highly processed convenience foods , or salty , sugary and fat-laden snacks may satisfy our desire for comfort . But such a diet does not satisfy our nutritional needs and can lead to low energy , constant cravings , mood swings and illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety , of foods , including fruits and vegetables , whole grains , low-fat sources of calcium ( broccoli , oranges , skim milk ) and lean sources of protein ( fish , skinless poultry , tofu , beans ) . And eat them in the most natural state possible ( fresh instead of canned , raw instead of cooked , steamed instead of fried ) . Use the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid ( listed on the packaging of many grocery-store foods such as bread , milk and cereal ) as a guide to healthier eating . For more information on nutrition , check out The Take Control Diet by Ian K. Smith , M.D. ( Random House ) or The Origin Diet by Elizabeth Somer , M.A. , R.D. ( Henry Holt ) . Eat your vegetables , but wash them first . Of course you want to provide your family with the recommended five to nine daily servings of vegetables or fruit . But with headlines warning of pesticide use and genetically modified foods , you 're not sure if those are toxic tomatoes lurking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever possible , says Ann Louise Gittleman , M.S. , C.N.S. , author of The Living Beauty Detox Program ( HarperSanFrancisco ) , because they are pesticide-free , do not contain transplanted genes and may have more vitamins than conventionally grown produce . And always wash produce thoroughly with a vegetable brush . A nontoxic cleanser such as Fit Fruit and Vegetable Wash can also help remove residues . Do n't wait to exhale . Stop and notice how you are breathing right now . More than likely you 're taking in shallow breaths , mainly in your chest . This poor breathing pattern limits detoxification . When we breathe fully and deeply , we not only take in more oxygen to nourish our cells , but we also get rid of more carbon dioxide and other toxins from the lungs . Learn to breathe properly . Try this technique once or twice a day , advises detox expert Fitzgerald ; ( 1 ) Lie on your bed with pillows under your head and knees , hands on your stomach above the navel . ( 2 ) Breathe fully into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Breathe out , pushing gently downward with hands . ( 4 ) Repeat ten times . ( 5 ) Lie still for a moment before rising . Feel more relaxed after deep breathing ? That 's a feeling available to you anytime , anywhere , especially during times of crisis . Breathing properly also improves immunity and sleep . DETOX YOUR RELATIONSHIPS Family , friends , colleagues , neighbors and lovers can all be great sources of intimacy , support and companionship . But those strained or estranged relationships that cause us to experience more stress than well-being are toxic . Some of those connections can be healed ; others may need to be severed . Many women can recite a litany of romantic disappointments and betrayals . But even these painful experiences can teach us powerful lessons about what uplifts us and what depletes us in our relationships . Move beyond Mr. Wrong . You want to be loved , yet he makes you feel less than loved . You suspect you are compromising yourself . Perhaps you 're fairly certain he has been cheating . Maybe you worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never fully commit . It 's painful to stay put , but you fear letting go . Trust your instincts . If you have nagging doubts about the man you 're dating , do n't ignore them . Grace Cornish , Ph.D. , author of Ten Good Choices That Empower Black Women 's Lives ( Crown Publishing ) , suggests examining the relationship by making a list of assets and liabilities . Questions to ask yourself How is the relationship fulfilling me ? What is it taking from , me ? Do 1 feel uncomfortable or neglected , or do I enjoy being with him ? If the liabilities outnumber the assets , you can do one of two things : Talk about it in order to change it , or move on . Letting go may feel lonely at first , but remember , you 're making room for greater self-respect and the wisdom to choose a better mate next time . Say later to a hater . You get off the phone feeling drained . That pal who is always complaining , gossiping or trying to tear down our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good luck ... " ) is not a true friend . Such people slowly erode our sense of self-worth and leave toxic feelings in its place . Do n't tolerate it : Focus on a friendship that is troubling you and ask yourself the same questions you asked about Mr. Wrong . A friend who constantly takes more than she gives may not be healthy enough to be in your life . Instead , spend time with yourself , or with positive people who bring you joy , encourage you and support your growth . Free yourself from old relationship funk . He left . You cried . You cursed his name . But months or even years later , you still fantasize about the good times , then replay the hurt in your mind and heart . You never want to be hurt like that again . But you can heal and find a divine-right mate . In order to be ready for a better relationship , you need to first exchange your misery for some insight . Cornish suggests a three-step detoxification process : Face it , erase it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest assessment of the relationship . " Ask yourself , What were the early warning signs " Cornish says , " and Why did I not act at that time ? " It may also help to ask friends for their perspective , and to write the answers out so you can see more clearly what you were not able to see before . Second , erase the relationship : " Tell yourself you deserve much better than that , " Cornish advises . " You deserve healthy love . " Finally , to replace it , get busy doing things you like to do . Develop a hobby ; spend time with good friends . Affirm that you are valuable . " This way , you are preparing yourself to go on with life and love again , " says Cornish . DETOX YOUR MIND All the trappings of our busy livesmessy desks , errand lists a mile long , piles of unread papers , phone messages , unread E-mail-take up valuable mental space as well as physical space . This clutter leaves us feeling frazzled and unable to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy doing to just simply be . Free up space to breathe and dream . Excess stuff in your bedroom closet , purse , refrigerator and even your car may represent stagnation in your life , says Gandy . The remedy ? A total cleanup starting with , say , your overstuffed closet . " If you have n't worn a garment in the past year , it needs to go , " she says . Donate items to charity or swap with friends . Cleaning out the mental cobwebs gives you clarity to dream , plan and move forward with your life . Take time-outs . Time for me ? What 's that like ? Many of us grew up with a mama who was on call 24-7 , and we came out of her womb with our own todo list . Taking a break , to many Black women , seems impossible . Not with the kids , the bills and other demands . But truth is , being in action mode most of the time leads to toxic stress levels . The constant flow of stress-related hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boost blood pressure and wreak havoc with our insulin levels . If you 're not well , you 'll be forced to slow down . So before that happens , start taking breaks . To keep stress in check , practice relaxation . " Relaxation is the state of not doing , " says Gandy , " and putting our minds at ease . " Ask yourself , What makes me feel at peace ? Sipping tea , doing yoga , quilting , an aromatherapy bath ? Then ask , Is this showing up daily in my life ? If you are n't doing things that relax you every day , list these activities in your planner or Palm Pilot as if they were important appointments , suggests Gandy . You 'll return to your tasks refreshed and reenergized , more present in the moment and more joyful . Practice meditation . You lie in bed with racing thoughts . After a few winks , you wake up with the same obsessions . It 's difficult to take care of ourselves when our minds are overwhelmed with worries and fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think straight , solve problems or be creative . Meditation can calm your thoughts and help lower blood pressure and heart rate . Detox expert Ann Louise Gittleman offers this technique : Sit with back straight , feet planted on the floor , palms upward . Close your eyes and focus on the place between your eyebrows ( the third eye ) ; concentrate on breathing . Choose a word or phrase such as " God is love " or " I am blessed " and repeat with each exhalation ; continue for ten minutes . Practice once or twice a day , and you 'll begin to notice benefits such as increased creativity , a sharper memory , a reduction in PMS or menopause symptoms and improved self-image , says Gittleman . DETOX YOUR EMOTIONS When we feel content and centered , we have the power to make choices in our best interest . However , when we do n't tend to our emotional needs , everything else suffers . Our culture tells us to " get over it " when we are depressed or panicky . But emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exorcise toxic emotions . Many of us harbor negative emotions from past experiences : They may include anger , resentment or guilt from a childhood disappointment or a bad breakup , and we do n't know how to let go . But a buildup of toxic feelings can trigger disease . Research shows that people who harbor hostility and suffer depression are more prone to heart disease . Holistic healers believe that conditions like cysts and fibroids may result from stagnant anger or negative feelings , says Gandy . One way to release such feelings is to write what she calls a " rant and rave " letter . In it you can do all the blaming and cursing you may not normally feel free to express toward someone who hurt you in the past . State exactly how you felt and why . This will begin to loosen up emotions so they can move through you instead of staying trapped inside you , says Gandy . Then , destroy the letter . ( If writing the letter brings up issues that continue to trouble you , you may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . if It 's easy to spot a sister who takes good care of herself-the one who radiates energy and good health . She walks with purpose and ease and speaks her mind without diminishing others . But many successful , talented women get lost in our children 's lives , in a job or a man or in someone else 's image of us . And self-neglect is as toxic as any other form of mistreatment . The cure ? " Nurture yourself , " says Cornish . And not by buying a new pair of shoes but by reconnecting with your purpose . " Make a list of things you 'd like to do , " Cornish says . Maybe you 've always wanted to travel . Or work for yourself . Whatever the goal , do n't wait until you reach a certain level at work or make a certain income . Start doing the research and networking to begin to make your wish list real . That way , Cornish explains , " instead of existing you start living . " Wade in the waters . Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply relaxed while also enhancing circulation and detoxification through sweating , say experts . One way to do it : Queen Afua , the holistic-health practitioner , suggests that you draw a warm bath with Epsom or Dead Sea salts to draw out toxins . Then add flower essences such as lavender or lotus oil to lift your mood . As you soak , notice the feel of the water against your skin and the way the warmth envelops your body . Sink in and enjoy the solitude and time to reconnect with yourself . DETOX YOUR SPIRIT The beliefs that drive our daily decisions and habits are often unconscious . Purging ourselves of self-defeating , toxic beliefs helps us get in tune with the Spirit that sustained our ancestors and can sustain us . Rewrite your life script . Life is hard . I have to struggle . I can depend only on myself The beliefs that we think define our lives can be our biggest obstacles . Our negative perspectives can be hard to change because they are so ingrained , having been passed down from generation to generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the weight of discrimination and hardships . But what we believe is what we become and what we create . To flip the script , we must first become aware of it . Start by writing down your thoughts during one day . What do you tend to think when a crisis comes up ? Where did those thoughts come from originally ? You can retrain your mind to embrace life-affirming thoughts like : I am blessed and whole . I am trusting the flow of life . My support is eternal . Release resentment . Maybe your father did n't give you what you needed because he worked nights or simply was n't there . Or perhaps your mother was harsh and hurtful . As you go through life , your resentment may be compounded by wounds that friends or mates inflict intentionally or unconsciously . The free-floating resentments we carry through the years poison our spirits and weaken our bodies as well . Forgiveness and understanding are the only ways to heal and move on . " Talk to your parents or to the individuals you feel did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then forgive . " If the individuals are deceased , write a letter . Know that by forgiving you 're not condoning the wrongdoing but releasing its power over you . While you 're at it , resolve to apologize to someone you 've hurt . Through these actions , you 'll begin to feel freer and more joyful . You 'll discover a sense of peace and grace , and begin to create what Afua calls " a divine life .
