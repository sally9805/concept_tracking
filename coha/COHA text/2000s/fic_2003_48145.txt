Barry Malzberg first introduced us to writer 's heaven in our May 1978 issue with " Big Ernie , the Royal Russian , and the Big Trapdoor . " He followed up with " Ring , The Brass Ring , the Russian and I " ( Aug. 1978 ) , " The Annual Once a Year Bash " ( March 1979 ) , and " Of Ladies Night Out and Otherwise " ( published in The Man Who Loved the Midnight Lady ) . John Kessel felt the time to return has come . Headnote This story takes place in the future , when everyone in it is dead . The fact that several of the dead people I mention here are still alive today should not be taken as expressing any preferences on my part . Quite the contrary . <p> NOT A LITTLE WATER HAS flowed under the bridge since last I told you about events in Writer 's Heaven . This is not because nothing has happened in the interim ( though it is certainly true that all the things that have happened fall within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final import of all these happenings has not effected any fundamental difference between then and now . Plus ca change , plus c'est la meme chose , as those of the French persuasion tell us . This is not to imply that the passing show is without its moments of interest , pathos , and instruction . Let me give you a for instance . I am working on my third gin of the evening when the night bus comes through . It is maybe eleven P.M. heaven time ( for the convenience of the inhabitants , our clock is synchronized to GMT ) . Writer 's Heaven is situated between Painter 's Heaven and Musician 's Heaven , in the creative quarter , and though it is not unheard of for residents of one of the other quarters to show up in ours ( habits being more or less the same , and some shades even having known each other in life ) for the most part the writers stick to themselves , etc . I look up from the table where I am sitting , near the front window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The driver , Bill the Cherub , despite his name and to the consternation of some of the veterans in Painter 's Heaven , is a lanky , dour sort of guy . He opens the bus door . " Writer 's Heaven , " he announces , and climbs down and opens the luggage compartment . He pulls out a couple of suitcases while two passengers step down from the bus . One of them is a well-groomed dame in her middle years , wearing too much makeup . She takes a look around , spots the lighted sign for the hotel across the street , and sets off for the entrance without a word , leaving Bill to carry her bag along after her . The other passenger is a tall fellow in a shapeless blue suit and no tie . He 's balding , and the graying hair he 's got could use the ministrations of a good barber . Dark eyebrows , not much chin , stoop shouldered , he looks like a guy who 's been spending a lot of time indoors , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us in the profession could be mistaken for , except for posers like Big Ernie ) . Only one thing wrong with this picture : He is carrying a violin case . The guy squints up at the sign over the door of the bar . The green neon makes his face look sickly , though that might just be the lingering effects of whatever illness brought him here , assuming it was illness and not something more sudden . Then he looks right at me through the window . I raise my glass to him , and that seems to settle it : he tucks the violin under his arm , picks up his suitcase , and comes in the front door . " Welcome , " I say to him . I was known to be irascible in my later years , but it 's little remembered how I had a convivial side . To tell the truth , not much at all is remembered about me . " Thanks , " he says and stands there looking around . It 's an awkward moment . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against . Chuck the Seraph 's has changed over the last thirty years . The management has had to cater to a slightly different clientele than in the old days . Many more ladies ( though the newer ones object to that designation ) . A menu sporting words like avocados and arugula . Some of these new guys like Paddy and Rod made their names in TV and the movies , and have a slightly warped understanding of what constitutes the necessities . So now the bar has videogames and plush red velour bar stools with brass trimmings , a brick inglenook fireplace with a godawful beaten brass bas-relief hanging above it , a big rack of wineglasses , TVs mounted in corners all around the room , lots of bric-a-brac like fishnets and anchors and crab cages and phony tin signs for turn-of-the-last-century root beer and athlete 's foot ointment . The TVs are tuned to cable stations with the sound turned down , and if you ask him nice , the bartender Louis will have mercy on your soul and in deference to the old-timers turn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable , and after all , this is supposed to be writer 's heaven . " I 'm Barry , " the newcomer says . " Can you stand me to a drink ? I do n't have any cash . " " Drinks are always and everywhere on the house , " I tell him , guiding him over to the bar . " Another homewrecker for me , " I tell Louie , " and my friend will have ... ? " " - a scotch , " says Barry . Most of the writers who are in the bar ( as usual , a significant contingent are in the brothel next door ) , busy throwing them down , do n't even notice that a new guy has come in . Scott , who has never learned to hold his liquor , is passed out in one of the booths . Big Ernie , in his safari vest and jodhpurs , is reminiscing with John Dos about some ski outing in the French Alps . Over in the Latin Corner , Jorge and Julio are playing a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sits himself down . " Cama , " says Jorge . " Casa , " says julio . " Casaba , " says Barry . The two of them look at him as if he has fallen off the back of a truck , then give him the cold shoulder . Barry turns his watery eyes elsewhere , spots the Royal Russian sipping an aperitif by himself . The Russian is not much of a socializer and keeps an exile 's distance , but Barry does not know that . He goes over and tries to strike up a conversation . " I was a great admirer of yours , sir . " " And you are ... ? " " Barry . " " You are a writer ? " " Over eight million words of published fiction . " The Russian smiles , thin as spring ice . " You counted the words ? " " Someone had to . That 's how I was paid . " Dashiell leans over . " Wrote for the pulps , did you ? Lots of us did . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Ray has pretensions . " Big Ernie stops talking to John Dos , and takes a good hard look at the new guy . " Who are you ? " " Barry , " the newcomer says . " New Yorker , right ? " says John C. John C. has his own problems with the bottle , which lends him no particular distinction around here , and he bats from both sides of the plate , if you get my drift , but these new guys do n't seem to care about that as much , and besides , Barry is not the kind who is likely to inspire lust . " New Jersey , " says Barry morosely . " Teaneck . " The poor bastard . Should have known enough to keep his mouth shut . Immediately starts up a chorus of mockery about Jersey , the swamps , the mob , etc. etc . The only sympathy Barry gets is from Will the poet , sort of a middle-class type , and old Walt the other poet , whose New York credentials go back so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That ai n't heat you 're packing , is it , soldier ? " says John O'H , gesturing at the case . " No . " " Then you got off the bus too soon , " says John G. " Musicians are the next stop . " " I 'm a writer , not a musician . " " A pulp writer , " says John U. We are rotten with Johns here in Writer 's Heaven . " What did you write ? " " I wrote all kinds of books . You might have liked Confessions of Westchester County . It was about suburban New Yorkers and their sex lives . Like Couples . " " Confessions of Westchester County ! " says Bernard . " I read that . That was a porn book . " " I sold it as pornography . " " Was all your work porn ? " " My most famous book was about an astronaut having a nervous breakdown . " " Never heard of it . " " Ah - It was published as Science Fiction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The briefest of smiles twitches his lips . " I see , " says Edmund W. Edmund was more of a critic than a fiction writer , and he seldom lets a judgment go unexpressed . " What do you see ? " Edmund smiles just like the Russian ( they were once the best of friends , before they became the best of enemies ) . " Nothing . I see not one damned thing . Enjoy your drink , Barry . " " Wait a minute , " Barry said . " I know that **27;1350;TOOLONG look . " He points at George O. " What about him ? He wrote science fiction . " " No , afraid not , comrade , " says George . " Political satire . " Barry looks around , locates tall Aldous . " And you ? " " Anti-utopia . " A little desperate now , he fingers Kurt . " You - you even published in the science fiction magazines . Did n't you ? " " Perhaps . But I was n't a sci-fi writer . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as serious as yours . Not only that - I wrote about things that the rest of you ignored . I wrote about the realities of technology . The engines of the night , grinding away . Your lives were being transformed by them-but all of you wrote as if the television , the computer , the birth control pill did n't exist . You - " He points at John U. " And you . " John C. " The problem , " says John U. , " was when you folks addressed those issues , you did n't address them in human terms . You worked within juvenile formulas that prevented you from doing the real work of fiction . " " Formulas ! What were your stories about coupling and uncoupling in suburbia but a formula ? Do n't speak to me of formulas ! " " Barry ... Barry ... yes ! " John C. says . " I remember - I read one of your books . I was guesting at a house on the Cape one summer , and I found it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of those New York Jewish books - Roth , Malamud . " Barry grasps at the straw of vindication . " You see ? " But as quick as he offers succor , John C. pulls it back . " So why did n't you publish with a real publisher ? The fact that you never did suggests some deficiency . Unless you believe there was some vast conspiracy against you . " " There might as well have been . Was there a conspiracy against Langston Hughes ? Kate Chopin ? " " There 's no conspiracy , " says Edmund . " A hundred different cut-throat editors prowl the dives of Manhattan looking for someone they can hitch their careers to , and you ca n't find one to bet on you ? Eight million words ? How can there be any quality when you 're grinding out books like sausage ? " Barry looks stung . He draws his head turtlelike back into his shoulders . He rallies . " What about Oates ? She wrote as much as I did . " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take responsibility for her . She 's a lady writer . " " All right , then , Faulkner - how many words did he churn out ? " A gray-haired man raises his head . " Do n't rightly know . I was pretty likkered up most of the time . " " Come now , Barry . Although we have the highest respect for Bill 's career - he earned that respect through blood and toil - even in his case we do n't speak well of all of those words . " " Well , I do n't speak well of all of my words , either , " Barry says . " So why must I be responsible for every word , when Faulkner gets a pass , and Oates gets a pass , and John U. - you , for god 's sake ! - how many words did you produce ? And you get a pass . My debilities are carefully marked down against my name . Your mistakes are forgotten and forgiven . " At this juncture I begin to tip to the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not end well . In fact , I would lay you eight to five against . Yet as a journalist and one who has himself all too often felt the sting of undue neglect , I can not help but put in a word . " The man has a point , gentlemen . He has a point . " " An argumentative sleight of hand , " says Edmund , who did not deign to notice me when we were alive , even when we chased the same women , and whose vision has not improved now that we are both dead . " It reeks of desperation . " He turns to Barry , and delivers the clincher . " If we let you in , whom shall we leave out ? " Barry looks like a bettor with money on the winning pony who on the way to the window sees a protest being filed . " But this is supposed to be heaven . How can you leave anyone out ? " " Ahh - you prove yourself a Utopian after all . It ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw clenches . He protests . He spills his drink . The discussion turns pugilistic and he takes a swing at Edmund , missing badly . Before you can say New York Review of Books , John O'H. and Red grab Barry by his collar and the seat of his pants and give him the bum 's rush . Since I am between them and the entrance , I duck out of the way and they hurtle past me , kick open the door , and toss him into the street . Barry lands on his knees and elbows , skids a yard or more , rolls over , and lies there . A couple of other patrons throw his suitcase and violin out after him . John and Red dust off their hands and come back inside for another round . Welcome to Writer 's Heaven . Watching him sprawled there , I feel a surge of pity , and despite the fact that no part of this contretemps may be counted as either my business or my responsibility , I set down my gin and exit the bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee of his trousers and the bleeding kneecap it exposes . He looks up at me . Neither of us says anything . He has an open face , for a homely guy , a kind of eagerness , even adolescence , beneath the dissolution . This is a guy , his face tells me , who has been disappointed a lot , but who , though he might not admit to it , hides inside his stoop-shouldered self a sliver of idealism . I take the gentleman by his forearm and help him to his feet . He tugs his jacket straight , brushes off his sleeves . " You do n't want anything to do with me . " " Horses for courses . Come with me , " I say , and head off down the street . Barry shrugs his shoulders and follows me past the hotel , the bordello , and the convenience store where , behind the counter under the fluorescents , Lenny the Seraph is studying a copy of Hustler , the stub of a Chesterfield dangling from his lip , his head wreathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays across his lips makes him look a little like an angel . Barry cradles the violin case under his arm . " What is in there ? " I ask . " Maybe you are packing heat ? " " Not hardly . " " I bet you wrote mysteries , too , right ? " " A couple . " " So , maybe there 's a gat in there . " " It 's a violin . " " Well , who am I to question a musician ? " " Not a musician . A writer . " A quarter of a mile down the strip I guide Barry into Verne 's , which even at this hour is doing business . Not as many women as in Chuck 's , but the booze is flowing and the conversations buzz . Nobody takes any notice of us while I order a martini , easy on the vermouth , and Barry a straight scotch . He throws it down , orders another , and makes that one vanish almost as quickly . He heaves a sigh that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and not , as is the most likely case , in Mother 's Heaven . " At least the bar stock is good , " he says . " No expenses spared , Barry . Would you expect less in heaven ? " Verne 's is a friendlier place than Chuck 's , if a little less upscale . Not a few of the stories of the patrons here took place in such bars , and Verne , whose first instinct was to recoil in horror at the declasse antics of the pulpmeisters who adopted his establishment as home , has loosened up enough to go along with the in-jokes . So the sign above the bar says POSITIVELY NO CREDITS , and on the end barstool sits perched a slender green alien of remarkably lifelike detail who is actually an objet d'art . If you drop a quarter in this creature 's ear , he will curse in Venusian , haul out a blaster , and vaporize one of the jars of pickled eggs Verne keeps at the end of the bar . Verne , leaning on his elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialism with Mack and Don . At one table Gordy and Harry are busy transferring the dregs of drinks from a number of small glasses to a tumbler , as if to conserve booze in straitened financial circumstances ( old habits die hard ) , while JWC , gesturing with his cigarette holder , harangues them about how you could turn an electric drill into an anti-gravity device . At the next table George E. smokes some herbs , eyes closed to slits as he contemplates murder or suicide . Bob the Admiral is explaining the mistakes Hitler made to Sprague while an arm 's length away Ike , in the process of flirting with Judy M. , throws in mocking commentary . Bob the Admiral does not notice , or if he does , does not deign to engage Ike in a contest of witticisms he is likely to be the loser of . My namesake the other Damon is making time with his wife , as who would not given the opportunity . He looks up long enough to greet us . " Damon , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The mandarins of literature at Chuck 's have interrupted their badinage about High Art long enough to show us the exit , " I tell him . " Let me introduce you to Barry . " Barry does not correct this misrepresentation about which and how many of us were thrown out , but he shoots me a grateful look . The patrons of Verne 's commiserate with him . Cyril growls , " Ef " em . We have a fine time over here . " " What did you write ? " asks Edmond H. " I wrote eight million words . " Bob S. comes forward . " I wrote fifteen million words . " Ike looks up long enough from Judy to shout , " I wrote twenty million . " " I wrote six million , " says Cyril . " By thirty-five . " Henry K. says , " I 'm not sure how many I wrote . Could n't keep track of all the pseudonyms . And half of it was Catherine . " " I wrote forty million , " says L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " mutters Cyril . It is a long established , you might even say bedrock truth , how little relation anything L. Ron says bears to reality . Barry looks like he 's come home . " I ca n't tell you how pleased I am to be here , " he says , raising his glass . From there the conversation rolls on famously . Barry gets roaring drunk . He seems to have read everyone in the place , and he tells them all how much he admires them , and they tell him how his perspicacity is exceeded only by his good looks . Mutual admiration is the best social lubricant , and I am congratulating myself on my good works when Bob the Admiral , having lost Sprague 's attention , joins in . " So , Barry , did you speculate about the future ? " " Not much , no . " " Hard science ? " asks Poul . " Nope . " " Fantasy - wizards , trolls , dragons ? " says Tony . " I was always open to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner wearing vests and smoking pipes . " If it were not for J.R.R. and the invention of the Xerox machine , a lot of our children would never have attended college . " " No . I did n't write that sort of fantasy . " " Well , tell us what you did write , then , " says Alfie , a speculative grin on his face . Barry looks a little uneasy . " I wrote a lot about astronauts having nervous breakdowns . I wrote about predicting horse races . I wrote about alienation - " " Aliens ! " says Hal . " Now you 're talking ! What sort of aliens ? " " No , not aliens . Alienation . I did some metafiction . " " Metafiction ? " A silence ensues " What do you mean ? " " Well , I wrote quite a bit about science fiction writers . " Little Lester pipes up . " You wrote about sf writers ? Who 'd want to read a story about sf writers ? " " I did a book like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgue . " " Did n't any aliens come into your story ? " asks Hal forlornly . " Not real ones . Hallucinations . My science fiction writer had a nervous breakdown . " " You 're big on nervous breakdowns , " says Alfie . Barry finishes off his latest scotch . His tongue is loosened . " Well - you guys - I hate to say it , but look at Gordy over there . The guy 's a walking nervous breakdown . And , you know - how many of you wrote for longer than ten years without becoming hopelessly drunk , hopelessly blocked , hopelessly unmarriageable ? Changing wives , changing agents , changing publishers - " " Ouch , Barry ! " says Cyril . " You do n't know what it 's like unless you 've been there . " " I was there . I know . " " And your point is ? " Lester growls . " My point is , you did n't start out to , but most of you ended up hacks . You did n't aspire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ground down , I understand . Believe me , I understand . " Bob the Admiral rises to attention . A bad sign . When he assumes that DI-on-the-parade-ground demeanor , the storm clouds are not far behind . " We were n't ground down . We wrote what we wanted to write . We were writing about the real facts of the twentieth century , not the trap of infidelity in suburbia . " Barry waves his big hand and laughs too loudly . " Methinks the man doth protest too much ! Most of what got printed was formula hackwork , ground out to order , debased copies of some better writer 's original . Time travel paradoxes , dinosaur hunts , galactic empires where you did n't even bother to change the togas you stole from Robert Graves . Bat Durston and his blaster riding a robot instead of a horse . " Little Lester looks like a hand grenade sans pin . I would not have liked to cross Little Lester . " Who the hell are you to speak to us like that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you played games . You worked within juvenile formulas that prevented you from doing the real work of fiction . How can there be any quality when you 're grinding out books like sausage ? " " And you were so much better . " " No , I was n't , " Barry says , inspecting the drink in his hand . " It 's a painful fact , I was not better than any of you , and worse than most . But the time comes when one must speak the simple truth or give up the ability to face oneself in the mirror , let alone ever to get a good night 's sleep . It was all waste and delusion . For most of us , our gifts were small . But small or large , we threw them away . Realize that I do not blame us - the world did not want to read the hard things we were capable of writing . So we stopped writing them . The best we did was to fling drops of water into the Sahara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment it seems like Barry 's eloquence might carry the day . Even Bob the Admiral looks a little misty-eyed , and Ike stops his incessant flirting . Then comes a snort of laughter from the back of the room . " What a crock ! " " Who is that ? " Barry asks me . " Chairman Brace , " I whisper . The personage who saunters up from the booth in the back is moon-faced and lank-haired , but his eyes glitter with a maniacal intelligence . He studies the assembled writers like an anthropologist studying a gaggle of primitive islanders . " You people are so Gutenberg ! So " I 'm the author and I 'm God . " There 's not a dime 's worth of difference between you and the fossils up at Chuck 's . You 're children under the covers with a flashlight , hiding from yourselves . " If you must be god , be clever , be subtle ! Launch the spearhead of cognition ! Burn the Motherhood Statement ! Create the whole world and watch what the reader does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novel . Be the invisible hand , not the jealous and uptight author , the literary control freak , terrified of freedom . " " I-period-E-period , " says Bob S. , " write computer games for illiterates . " " No , he 's right , " says Barry . " We are dinosaurs . That 's why we 're all so bitter . We - " " - and we 've had just about enough of you , " says JWC . " I do n't know how you stumbled into this place - " " - Damon brought him . " " - but it 's clear you do n't really belong . Am I right , brothers ? " A chorus of agreement greets him ( including from the Chairman ) , and before you can say New York Review of Science Fiction , Barry is forcibly shown the door , and his exit is not noticeably more ceremonial than his exit was earlier in the evening . I go outside and find him inspecting a tear in the opposite knee of his trousers . " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like when we are in our cups . " Barry looks up at me . He says nothing . " Let 's go back to the hotel . I think I can get us a bottle from the concierge , and we can sit out on the verandah and listen to the mourning doves . This really is heaven , you know . " The door to Verne 's opens and Barry 's suitcase and violin come flying out . Barry manages to catch the violin case before it hits the ground , but the suitcase lands on a corner and spills underwear and black socks over the cruel pavements . Now he grows angry . " Heaven ? Rather , the seventh circle of hell . " He stumbles to his feet , kicks the suitcase against the brick wall , smashing it to flinders . " No exit ! " I try to calm him , but he shrugs off my hand and storms down the street . Then he stops . He peers down an alley , then turns off between the buildings into the fields . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the closest thing to a story I have witnessed in many an evening , and it is not over . So I hurry along after . I have never been out here before , at least at night . The fields of heaven are full of sweet-smelling grass . Beneath the silver Moon the ground rolls like the sea , and Barry 's state of intoxication or fury forces a misstep ; he trips and falls into a gully . He rolls down the slope to the stream at its bottom . The thread of silver flows along , shining of its own power like a ribbon of mercury . It chuckles a little as it runs . Where the water falls over smooth rocks , its convex surface reflects the stars in the night sky like pinpricks of diamond . " What is this stuff ? " " Water . " Barry touches his finger to the stream , holds it to his nose and sniffs . He touches the tip of his finger to his tongue . Then Barry kneels down , scoops a double handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his haunches . He opens the violin case . It does , indeed , contain a violin . The light from the stream gleams along its polished surface . He holds the instrument under his chin while he rosins the bow . Then he places his left hand to the fingerboard and , without any preliminary , begins to play . The music cuts through the air like a new ray of moonlight . Now I am not noted for my appreciation of the higher arts , and the last time I tried my hand at commentary I received the explanation , " Shut up , " but believe me when I tell you that I have never heard anything so lovely . Adagio . Soft , then louder . Beautifully modulated . It is as if the angels themselves weep - not the angels we see here like Chuck and Louie , but the angels two millennia of the Christianity I do n't believe in and Barry does not either have imagined for us . Barry 's eyes are closed and I realize for the first time that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to do , so I lie down on the soft grass and look up at the stars , more stars than there are lights on Broadway . I feel myself breathing . I forget that I ever wrote anything , that I ever lived or died . Barry 's face holds an expression of sadness , and I have no idea whether he could play like this back on Earth , or whether the night or the scotch or the water have transformed him , but whatever it might be , his music erases time , then space , then identity , and I become nothing more than a fleeting , pleasant thought in the mind of an idle god . " Abducting is for losers , babe . " <p>
