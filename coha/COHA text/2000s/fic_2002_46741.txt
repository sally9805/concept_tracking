WE ENTERED THE CITY IN the hour after the first sunset . It was twilight . Thick bluish dusk , like smoke , rose from the ground . Out of this , the cliffs of buildings towered to touch the luminous sky , that was , and would stay , too bright for any but the fiercest stars to show . <p> Night could never come here . Here , night was done with . <p> " Do n't be so awed by this , " said Hassent . <p> I looked at him " No ? " <p> " No . It 's an old city , partly destroyed by aerial action , partly ruinous . <p> And after sunfall it lies between two suns , the second and smaller of which will rise in three hours . That 's all . The facts . " <p> " Really . " <p> He smiled . Oddly , in the half-dark , his own darkness was paler . <p> " Well , what would you say then , Aira ? " <p> " There were n't always two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Once there used to be night . " <p> " But now there is n't , only twilight . Just perfect for scum like us to burgle in . " <p> Why did we have this discussion ? To pass the time , probably , while we rested on the terrace-wall after the appalling climb up from the valley below . We had used ropes , of course , and each of us was agile as a monkey , but it still took a long while and was peril-fraught enough to satisfy even Hassent 's irritating taste for dangerous , arduous exercise . <p> From the terrace , we could look down straight through into the City . A vista was carved for miles by a wide boulevard like the bed of a precisely ruled river . The strange smooth buildings , rising either side , with their pointed windows that had the shape of fingers , ended frequently in shattered tops , where the bombardment had hit them all those years ago . And obviously , there was nobody anymore to light a lamp . From the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another feature of the surrounding mountains . It had done so often , our Source had assured us . You had to know , and have a map . And then there was the climb . But Hassent and I were used to climbs . Up the sheer towers of ancient palaces , along the sloping insides of charming sewage systems .... We were thieves . The climbing , like the robbery , was part of our job . <p> But the second sun filled me with concern . It lay now , just under the horizon , throwing upward a preview of light the way the first sun , the real sun , does at dawn . The second sun was not real . It had been made and raised and set to circle the City by magic . They - the ones who once lived here - had called it the Great Lantern . Now these magicians were gone , bombed out of residence by some of their numerous enemies from across the mountain range . But the second sun , the Great Lantern , that remained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so here , there could never be night . And - what else remained ? <p> I had said something like this to him , back in the desert , when we were at the last halt , and sold off the riding-urts . We had a night ( yes , because there was night , out there ) on the town , he with a pretty female pay-me , and I with a handsome male pay-me . We had also drunk the wine  --  wells dry . And in the intimacy post-received pleasure and alcohol , I had let slip to Hassent my doubt about the magics of this place  --  whether they were truly finished . But Hassent had only said , " All gone . All that 's left in the City is treasure beyond the dreams of insanity . That 's why we 're going . And it 's a bit late to coward out . We 've spent all our money . " <p> Now , on the terrace , he said , businesslike , " Let 's make a move , shall we ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the inside drop , to where a flight of broken steps hung in the dusk . <p> To descend was to go down into the gathered dark . The other way , the glowing green-blue sky watched us indifferently . I looked it in the eye , coiled up my rope , and followed Hassent down the stair . <p> WHEN I WAS a child in Sheemelay , the masters who taught me theft had also taught me quite a lot of superstition . Tie always the left boot up after the right boot ; lick your finger and touch the stone of your marked building , to placate it with a bit of yourself . ( Blood was better , but then you had to be careful . ) Over the years , especially once I partnered up with Hassent , I had stopped , or tried to stop , some of this . Hassent had absolutely no time for it . He is a pragmatist . " You take , " he was fond of saying , " till it takes you . " But old habits die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we got down into them , seemed buried , as if in a cellar . The effect was heightened by all the upper streets which rose above , and sometimes forded the lower in the form of bridges . Several of those had been smashed by bombs . The surviving masonry stuck out , and in the unending dusk seemed to have weird shapes , like the staring heads of huge beasts with open jaws <p> I said nothing about this fancy to Hassent . Five years of his company had enabled me to imagine what he would say back . <p> There were gardens in the City . Some must have been there to begin with , parks with curious tapering pines and thin stone statues . But the gardens had overgrown themselves and spread , and elsewhere groves of weeds , bushes , and trees had sometimes seeded in the walls and avenues . Even so , the City , beyond certain areas of rubble , drifts of dust , old leaves , the ground-down shale of fallen marble , was tidy , spacious , and uncluttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archway , to consult the map . <p> Beyond lay a vast plaza . It was closely and immaculately paved except in one spot far across , where bomb damage had caused two or three buildings to collapse . A fountain stood at the square 's center , pristine . As we lurked , peering over the map by the light of Hassent 's glow-worm torch , a snake hissed loudly from the square and a prickle of new stars shot off from the fountain into the air . <p> " It 's fine , Aira . Calm down . " <p> " But - " <p> " Some of their gadgets still work here . We know that , we 've been told that . " <p> " I thought it was an exaggeration . " <p> " Their second sun still works so why not a mere fountain ? " <p> " Yes , I see . " Did I ? I watched the water-jet playing up its spangles at the sky . Was there enough green light even so for it to glitter quite so eloquently ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get our bearings . We came in over South Wall . Sun Two will rise up there , in the mountains , when it does . That 's north , then . And this plaza , I believe , is this one on the map , with the building they call the Oratorium - look , you see ? - that skinny tower with its hat off - so now we go that way . " <p> It was tepid , but not cold . Yet sometimes little breezes blew , and they varied , some much colder than the cool , some much warmer than tepid . Different atmospheres still existed here . <p> We walked out finally through the plaza 's center , to avoid the fallen buildings . I gazed once more at the fountain . The jet emerged from the mouth of a figure cast from some glassy , half-transparent material . It was not human , nor quite anything else . I could not make out what it was , really , although somehow it was disturbing . But Hassent was already about a hundred strides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the square 's furthest edge , I glanced back . And the water had sunk again , vanished . We must have trodden on some hidden lever under the paving that started it off , perhaps on another one this side to shut it down again . <p> If there were hidden levers for that , there might be some for less amusing things . I caught him up and told him my idea . He smiled . He said , " It 's all right , Aira . I remembered to tie my left boot last . " <p> Probably we walked for an hour more . I can judge time as a rule , even on this journey to the City after I lost my timepiece playing Blackcard in Kulbin . But I do it by the sun , or the moon , I suppose , or the infinitesimal slinking of the stars - and here that would not be possible . <p> To reach the place we were aiming for , we had to trek ever deeper down , down into those buried cellars of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way still got steadily darker . <p> I noticed he failed to light anything stronger than the torch . <p> We stopped at last , and had a swig of water laced with ginger-root spirit . <p> " There it is , " he said . <p> " - , " I answered , cautiously . <p> The building was low and long , and long again - there seemed to be acres of it . The Thesaury of the City . The bombs had never reached it , even all the way down here , where , if they fell , as we had already seen , they had always caused maximum destruction . I thought of the war-balloons gliding over , the deadly copper wires strung out , and the impacted electric charges descending - lovely as fireworks - each an induced lightning  --  strike . Once , I had had the dubious delight , in the course of my job as a thief , of pretending to be a server at an orgy arranged for some military general . I recall his holding forth on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alchientist Xos . They have been used in many spots , always to enormous effect . Now , outside the treasure house of the City , I considered the City 's own general survival . All told , it had withstood the onslaught unusually well . And yet - it was empty . None of the stories explained that . Of course , perhaps the living citizens had simply fled or been captured . I wondered too , why the clever aerialist bombardiers had not put out the second sun , while they were at it . Conceivably those electric bombs just could not fly upward ? <p> " Are you ready ? " Hassent inquired . <p> I jumped . " ... not quite . " <p> " Come on , Aira . Stop looking like a curd-sick yurt . You 're not usually as bad as this . " <p> Normally I would have snapped back with something . I did not . <p> This low , the faintest glimmer of dusk was still floating like clouds between the pillars and the finger-shaped door-mouths of the building we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a trick of the eyes . But even so . They fluttered , in and out , up and down . Poor things , were they thinking they were still alive , and wondering why the City was unlit and full of holes ? Had they forgotten ? <p> According to the Source ( that man Hassent and I had eventually , after months of scheming and bribes , got to meet in Kulbin ) , this treasury was the one which held the greatest amount of treasure . There were zi-rubies the size of a two-year-old child , electris in bundled rods seven feet in length , emerald and qualium , and Plum-Breath , the Tireless smoke  --  conducting purple jade . Elsewhere in the City lay other caches , but nothing like this one . Nothing but this one was worth bothering with , if you had actually managed to reach the City , scale the walls , get in . Why then , I had murmured all those miles and days ago , had no one else , the Source himself for example , ever gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and returned richer than a thousand kings . But they could only carry so much down the mountains and the walls . And as there was such a lot , still plenty of it was left . As for himself , he thanked me for my compliment , but he was too old for such a jaunt . We had cut him in , of course . We left the usual pledge - a vital piece each of our entry-exit ribbons , issued by the Royal Kronarchery . The Source seemed frantically keen that we succeed . His map was of the best . <p> " Hassent - did anyone say there was - anything - here ? " <p> " Not apart from mounds of treasure . You heard it all the same as I did . " <p> " But the Great Lantern is still operating . And that fountain - " <p> " Oh for the love of life , Aira ! Forget the bloody fountain . Let 's get on . " <p> Just then , something cried in the City . <p> It sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the amphitheater effect of this lower depth , it was all-present , everywhere around us . The cry was soulless , savage , yet desolate beyond description . We both stood , paralyzed in the ringing pulse of it . And then it was over , and only memory replayed it on and on inside the ear . <p> " There are no animals here , " I said . I spoke incredibly softly - not quite a whisper . " Everyone says , no animals , no birds , come into the City . Not even mountain wolves or lilynx . Not even eagles set down on the highest roofs - or even fly over - " <p> " I saw crows flying about , when we were coming up from the valley - something at least , down inside the wall , flying over , black - or maybe not . But anyway , you 've said it . This thing is outside the City . Up in the mountains . Crags echo . We just heard it . " Hassent also was speaking very , very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would never see . <p> " Outside ? You 're joking . It 's inside . With us . What was it ? " <p> I was not asking Hassent . But anyway he said , " Some mechanism , could be . It did n't sound animal really , did it , let alone human . Machinery , like the foun - " <p> Whatever it was , it chose that moment to cry again . <p> Hassent 's words and voice were obliterated . Thought was obliterated . Only feeling responded to the fearful sound . <p> It was unbearable . Heartless - yet it was filled by a terrible agony wounded and agonized yet it was raw with malevolence beyond expression . I mean , my expression . The thing which cried expressed it only too well . <p> In the second aftermath , he and I stood like a couple more statues . Then Hassent shook himself . <p> " Listen , Aira . Whatever it is , and it might just be nothing , it 's miles off . Trust me , I 'm good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very best course - " <p> Before he had finished I had taken the hint . And we were running , both of us , light and terrifically fast , toward the shelter of the treasurehouse . <p> Here is a confession . <p> When things get serious , I always find myself glimpsing back , with bittersweet nostalgia , to my childhood - which was only ten years ago , mostly , if I count adultness from when I was fifteen . In those minutes as we ran inside the dusk within that City canyon , and threw ourselves headlong up the pillars , and next at the low balcony rail of a tall window - there flashed through my mind quick images of my days in the Thiefs ' School of Sheemelay . I saw the teachers , the fellow pupils - even the thick green quarrel trees in the courtyards . Although , as with all such institutions , the school was reckoned to be a secret , everyone knew . The town was proud of it . They also took a cut from the proceeds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robs on his own turf - so the better school a town has , the safer its townizens . <p> But , from thinking like this , I knew how afraid I was now . The last occasion I became so nostalgic was the day in Yot , when I was nearly hanged .... <p> The window behind the railing had a kind of glass in it . It was the type of glass that is melded all through to metal , opaque and shining like tarnished platinum . We could see nothing the other side of it either , in the non-light . But Hassent produced his glass-biter , and scored in swiftly , so a pane dropped away . We crushed through after , into the dark behind the dark . <p> All this while , there had been no other noise from the City . By which I mean , no other cry . <p> Once inside the Thesaury , Hassent and I froze again . We stood there , listening to the hoofbeats of our hearts , hoping that was all we would have to hear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound . <p> Maybe three minutes passed . Then he spoke . <p> " It 's as black as night in here even if there is n't any night . I 'm going to chance the sparkle . " <p> " Hassent - that 's going to be bright . What if - 11 <p> " What if what ? " <p> " If something out there sees . " <p> Hassent said , sensibly , " Fine . But how else do we find our way anywhere ? " <p> " Use the glow-worms . " <p> " Not in here . Here 's too big . And you know there might be guardians - and catches . " <p> This was definite . Even if there were nothing supernatural , there would surely be the sorts of pits and snares all cities , if possessed of fabulous wealth , tend to leave lying about , the way the ordinary householder leaves mousetraps . <p> " The sparkle , " I said , " might activate just that . " <p> " A light-reactive catch ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of that has decayed . I mean , if it had n't , we 'd have been stumbling over it everywhere already . " And then , having consulted me and ignored my opinion , Hassent switched on his sparkle . It sat up on his left shoulder like a tiny obedient moon , casting out its bluish clarity . " Going to chance yours , then ? " he queried . <p> I thought that was unnecessary , for all about us a wide hall had become visible end to end in the single sparkle 's rays . <p> " This is one of the outer Arrival Rooms , " I said . " I remember from what we were told . " <p> " Where they took the tribute in , " he agreed , " and the tax from traders . And all those clerks sat at all those benches over there along the wall , weighing the gems and bars , counting the cash . " <p> We looked at the benches , which were of marble . There were also marble stands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The carving is complicated , " I said . <p> It monopolized every surface . Curls and tendrils ( leaves ? hair ? ) , out of which squinted disturbing faces again , that were not quite human , not quite anything else , like the figure in the fountain . They had , the faces , no necks , but little paw-like hands . The sparkle winked slowly over their marble eyes , polished by age and the rubbing quality of pure vacance . <p> There was an uneasy melancholy about the carved faces , but this did not dispel the sense I had of something more ominous . Like the cry we had heard , I thought , misery coupled here with some dreadful other thing , a sort of evil so unlike anything that mankind knows or makes - as to be utterly beyond hope . <p> " I do n't like this room , Hassent . " <p> " Retie your boots , " he said . " Lick your finger and rub it on the wall , " he mocked . " Pee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hassent juggled his eyebrows . " You 're right , " he said . " It stinks of something foul in here . Like a dead rat the size of a kronarch 's palace . Only , it is n't a smell . " <p> " No . " <p> He reached out and took my hand , squeezed it , let go . <p> " What do you want to do , Aira ? Go back ? " <p> I considered . I am contrasuggestive , evidently , because now he had come round to my own view so suddenly , I began to decide we were being crazy . Greed , no doubt . <p> " We 've got this far , " I said . " Let 's - " <p> And then , oh then , out there It cried out again . <p> Hassent too made a small noise . The Arrival Room went black as he slammed off the sparkle like a blow . <p> When the awful , awful threnody had finally died-from the air , from our inner ears - I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " nearer . Was n't it ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> " What the Bear 's Best Bits is it ? " <p> " Something ... very big . <p> " And lonesome . " <p> " And malign - " <p> " - beyond our worst-ever nightmares . Why , " he added , with virtuous indignation , " did no one tell us about this ? " <p> " Do you think it saw your light ? ' r <p> " Do n't ask me , " he said . <p> " Well I 'm not about to call out and ask it . " <p> We poised , in soundlessness . The Cry now was not repeated . I said , at last , " What time is it , Hass ? " <p> He cupped his hand , shielding his time-piece dial , and read the lighted sign . " Thirty-first hour plus nine . Only half an hour till the second sun comes up . " <p> We thought about this , both of us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , circled round the City , going back to sink again in the mountains where it rose , a brief space before real dawn . It gave a vivid illumination very like the Earth 's Sun . Or so it was said . Would it then give enough light therefore to frighten anything off - or alternatively , give anything enough light - to hunt by ? <p> " Downstairs , " said Hassent presently , " inside this building 's core , the treasure - there may be catches , but it 's a vault . Do you see ? " Vaults might be closed off , be defensible . I nodded in the dark as if he could see me . " Yes . " <p> There were about seventeen flights of stairs , some short and some of fifty steps - or so I judged ; I was hardly counting very exactly . We employed both glow-worms , and even when the stairs became wet and slippery from something- rain , or a watercourse that had broken through somewhere - we did not put on the sparkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe , and despite our not having heard anything - unusual for ages . <p> Below the seventeenth ( if it was ) staircase , there lay stretched a bizarre and awesome thing . It was a guardian , sure enough . Mages , and royalty occasionally , have access to such creatures . Perhaps not stupidly , I had anticipated several of them scattered about the City . But this one was still as the stone , and even when we came right up to it , it never raised its head , or blinked an eye . <p> " It 's dead , " said Hassent . <p> " More than that . It 's fossilized . Ancient . " <p> We spent a while walking around it , touching it , marveling . It was very big , the size of an elephant , or mammatoth . From the large head , the curved tusks extended , black as jet , but the great eyes were shut by crenelated lids . Apparently it had died peacefully , maybe of old age and in its sleep . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond the guardian was a closed door of iron , patterned all over by what looked like magical inscriptions . <p> " This is it . " <p> Our Source had been precise about this door , the one recognizable entry to the treasure chamber . So we stood and chanted in unison the formula we had learnt by heart , and repeated over and over for a year , for practice . And then Hass struck the door seven ringing clouts against the to-us-unsecret secret lock . <p> For a moment , nothing . I thought , Everyone 's deranged . This wo n't work <p> And then , like the strangest animated cluster of vines , the door began to unfurl and untwine from itself , until all the unroped skeins of patterned iron had drawn away into the walls either side . <p> We moved into the treasure chamber , Hassent and I. <p> " Oh , Aira - " he exclaimed , " just look - " <p> Never in my life had I ever seen anything like it . And I had seen inside quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose up and up , about five stories of it , tunneled right through the middle of the Thesaury Building , windowless , yet lit by the dullest yellow lights that were blearing into awakeness on every ledge , roused presumably by someone 's coming in . <p> By this vague illumination , still we saw the substance of the tales . Zi-rubies , mostly of absurd enormity , stacked up from floor to distant ceiling , like columns of fiery blood , emeralds green as the sea that lay packed tight as figs in clear glass boxes , pink sapphires heaped more carelessly in low pens , over which they had sometimes coyly spilled .... Electris was ranked along , row on row , in bundles , like spears , as we had been told . Next to the pale gleam of it burned the matured glow of gold , in bricks , rings , rods , and hot-white jidel silver , one good piece of which sells for a year 's luxury , in cups and shields , body mail and beast-armor , or formed into books , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of golden qualium . Qualium was there in balls too , and milky galvanic schist in globes , which were only less in girth than the breathtaking globes of the rose-white pearls .... Against the walls , marshaled behind the rest , were banks of jade , green and purple , and man-high sheets of aromaticor , with useful perforations so strips could be torn off - And there were other things one barely glanced at , faced with such riches showers of polished diamonds , crusts of scintillant coppery tope <p> We forgot everything , even ourselves . It was almost a religious experience , standing there in the Thesaury , gazing at all this unbelievable but actual and proximitous wealth , and thinking of the splendid cities of Yot and Belu and Charinth , in which we might , now , be going to reside like kings <p> But then . The thought came too , riding in over the others , and because of them , the thought which asked , Why have so few benefited from this place ? <p> For there are thieves everywhere , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps are scarce , several are reckoned to exist and look , we had one . And provided you had too the two or three necessary charms , and some stamina , and a head for heights - crags or stairs - what was the problem ? <p> As often happens in the end , Hassent and I were having this thought together . Though we are as unlike in most ways as chosh and cheese , we know each other 's minds , since , at root , they are about the same . <p> " Well , " he said . <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> And then a voice said something , clear and mild , out of the walls . <p> We jumped like grasshoppers . <p> Even though all it said was a statement of the obvious : You stand in the Thesaury of the City . <p> After that there was a pause , presumably for us to collect ourselves . And then : We are gone . Therefore you are welcome to our wealth . If you have come so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We grudge you nothing , for we have now no use for it . <p> This is where our similarity of minds , Hassent 's and mine , diverges . He began to relax , he began to look glad and approving of this ancient wisdom which had generously made him its heir . <p> I , however , braced myself tensely for the rest . Which presently came . <p> Know also that your acquisition is to be brief . Nor lucky . <p> Hassent , already scrabbling at one of the shorter hills of rubies , slid noisily back to the floor . <p> " Ssh ! " <p> But even over the rush , rattle , thump and plink of disturbed gems and Hassent landing on the marble , I heard every word . And so did he . <p> I had been wondering , as I said , about them , where they had gone , and why . I even pondered why exactly the City had been attacked , and by whom ? Magicians collect animosity , of course . That was what everybody who spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemies had come over the mountains in their war-balloons , and meted out electric bombardment . <p> The voice in the Thesaury was mechanical . I have heard such voices in other spots , in theaters , or religious auditoriums . Our entry or activity seemed to have triggered it , just like the magically automatic lamps . <p> Now the voice explained , in its calm and genderless tones , how the City of magicians had in fact bombed itself . They had been attempting , it transpired , to wipe out a dread menace which had grown in their midst . But the menace , as they had feared , proved elusive and invulnerable , and eventually only much fruitless destruction was achieved . <p> After that , seeing resistance was not to be made to their adversary , the mages , regardless of their powers , surrendered to fate . They put away their armament and their sorcery , and waited without remonstrance , until the menacing horror they had been unable to destroy killed each and every one of them . <p> Ask then where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the voice , Into the maw of it . The fault was ours , for we ourselves created it , although in ignorance , unmeaning to , and supposing what we created was its very opposite . Regard the ruin of this city with compassion , for you also , since you have ventured here , must now become the prey of that which murdered us . Be advised , this thing is inescapable . Waste no futile struggle upon evasion . Submit with grace . Soon you will join us in eternal silence . Thus farewell - and greetings . <p> We stood strainingly alert for some further while , but the voice rendered nothing more . <p> IT 'S ALWAYS like this in these historic dumps , " said Hass . " Bloody old dog-in-the-trough curses everywhere , We ca n't have it anymore , so neither can you . Touch the cash and it 's unavoidable doom . " <p> " That is n't what it said , " I protested . <p> " All right , it smugly told us : Take everything , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll get you , so cheers ! " <p> We had recovered enough to choose some of the glorious stuff that was additionally portable , and pile it up in two neat heaps near the open door . But our hearts were not in it , really . <p> We both kept looking toward the open door , as well . And out over the hump of the fossilized guardian they had been so powerful they had not bothered to replace , along the last stairway , into the dark . Where lay that which the powerful ones had been forced to submit to . <p> Neither of us had discussed the notion that the thing which made those noises was the very self same . <p> But besides , nothing stirred . And we had heard no further sound , no other - cries . <p> " I ca n't concentrate , " Hassent growled suddenly , kicking into a miniature stack of faultless emeralds , so they spun in all directions . " All this - and I ca n't appreciate it . " <p> " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the loot we had accumulated . " We have enough here , " I said , " anyway , probably , to ensure we can live individually to three hundred , in relative comfort . " <p> " That 's not the point . " <p> " No , Hass . " <p> " This is like- like a wonderful gallery of artifacts and art - it should be savored . It should be searched , carefully , for days , for the most perfect and unique items - " <p> " Well , we could , " I suggested doubtfully . <p> " It 's been spoiled , " he petulantly grieved . <p> Later he said , " It 's the thirty-third hour . The second sun 's up by now , though not high yet . I have a theory about their Great Lantern , Aira . I think they put it up to counteract this thing , this monster menace they so sloppily inadvertently created . It must be at its best in the night . Only the extra sun did n't work either , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here - no animals , no birds - not even a nocturnal lizard , bat , or moth . <p> " I 've got a theory too , Hass . I think the only people who turn up here - adventurers , thieves , whatever - get sent here by the ones who 've got too much sense to try it themselves . Like our beloved Source , who gave us the charms and such a choice map . He was n't that old , he could have done it . I believe we 've been used like experimental beasts . We 've been sent in to see what happens to us - if the City is safe yet for a general stealing spree . " <p> " And when we do n't come back , " appended Hass grimly , " they 'll know it still is n't . " <p> Again later , I said , " I wonder if just waiting it out down here until full sunrise might work . Perhaps it - goes to its lair - " <p> " No , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiding did n't work . Although - well , have you even seen any skeletons - any remains ? Only that guardian over there , and that 's been deceased for centuries from the look . As for people of our sort , have we met anyone ever who claimed to have been here ? Even if nobody would boast , word gets round . No , no one ever got back , Aira . And neither will we . " <p> Because I am contrasuggestive , as I said before , or over-optimistic or , more likely , too scared to be pessimistic , I began quietly to try to reason us out of this mood . I produced many cliches , perhaps even one stating the magicians had been spineless to give in . <p> And then something extraordinary happened and shocked us both to our feet . <p> A flaring orange light began to slant straight in at us from nowhere , yet somehow above , igniting as it did so the guts of the treasure chamber and a million jewelry eyes . <p> Inexplicable - then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seemed to be stone , was another example of that somber metal-glass . And over it the Great Lantern now took its way . Second dawn poured in . <p> If things had been different , I might have been impressed by this underground view of the magic sun . It looked , through the glazing , precisely like a sun , rather smaller , though hardly less brilliant than the real one . I had heard the magicians produced it out of some alchientistic combustible previously unknown , firing it from a vast gun , which also struck it alight like flint-and-tinder , straight into the sky . Even at its apex , it hung lower than the true sun , of course , or the moon , inside the atmosphere of the world - but seen like this from the Thesaury , you would never guess . <p> As we gaped at it , Terror , which perhaps we had both mislaid again a second , burst shrieking from the City above and dropped down on us . <p> I thought it was a cloud - something passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something falling .. weightless , harmless - But once through , that cry came with it , from silence , booming , like a wind of steel needles <p> We two tumbled , rolled , crashed against arcades of rubies that only rocked , throwing off a few bloody drops . <p> Terror landed , still screaming roof . For it could come right through anything . <p> There was no time to demand idiotically What is it ? Though the mechanical voice had been ambiguous and everyone else had lied . There was also no room for speech in the noise-punctured air . <p> I had rolled all the way back against a sheet of the priceless purple jade beloved of tyrants . The jade obligingly tipped down all round me , cracking , then breaking in shards on the floor - but that was nothing . <p> The creature crouched now in the middle of the vault , not needing to position itself , passing through and over everything that was there . It was shadow-black - everything that it covered passed within it , and disappeared - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the ocean deeps , and swim without limbs and see without eyes . This was all that , nor did it have any mouth to make its crying , nor any maw to take us in and keep us , as it did not keep the other things it swarmed upon and through and over . And it was Fear Incarnate . My bones had turned to jelly and my blood to talc . Though I am strong , then I had no strength . I lay among the broken fire-conducting jade , and became an abject victim , as the mages had done . Just as Hassent was doing . As anyone would . <p> The core of it was fathomless yet void . I stared . That was where we would be going . Like them . Into that blackness that was a Nothingness , into that silence aeons beyond its own aching scream . All-blackness it was , black night without moon or stars - yet it was unrepelled by the light of the second sun , which boiled around it . indeed it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bewildered , I saw Hassent abruptly roll again , and leap back to his feet . He was running to where the huge rods of electris stood in ranks , and the balls of qualium and schist . Sprawled there , I watched , and observed him heft one of the enormous spear-like bolts . I thought , Panic has sent him off his head - he was going to attempt to lance the creature of darkness - which somehow could swallow nothing save one thing anything which lived - but a spear would pass through it , useless , for It was made only of black , only of nothing , only of utter night <p> As the first electris rod smote against the metal-glass ceiling five stories up , I too was on my feet . I seized the nearest object , a lesser zi-ruby dislodged and still of substantial size , and flung it too . From that , and Hass 's rain of spears , the metal-glass had begun to fracture . Spiderwebbing flashed over the scald of the sun . <p> We kept at this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activity , neither of us looked - over there , where death was moving without haste , savoring or only sluggish after the hunger of such a long wait for food like us . <p> Not looking , throwing missiles , yet I began to lose hope . This seemed the proper moment to do so . And then , the miracle . In one spasm , all the roof glass fissured together , the metal bonding preventing its breaking open or dropping through , keeping the outer skin whole , but letting it shatter internally . For a second there was a kaleidoscope of spattering lights , then a freckled darkness , and then full dark came back . <p> When the dull lamps winked on again , the only dark in there was the dark . The other Dark - that had vanished . <p> I knelt on the floor , shaking . Shaking too , I imagine , Hassent leant on a pen of sapphires . <p> " We had the same thought again , " he said . <p> " That 's generous . You had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not debate our genius potency . We have whatever time is left before either 1 ) the whole ceiling collapses and we go back to the first chess-square , or 2 ) the ceiling collapses after the Great Lantern has passed but while the real sun is coming up . The only safe time was dusk . But we dare n't wait . " <p> " We ca n't stay here , " I agreed . <p> " And meanwhile , up there , what chance do we have ? " <p> " We 've discovered now what it is . " <p> " They learned that , the mighty magicians , but they could n't do a thing . " <p> I said flatly , " They were altruistic , perhaps , or guilty . It was their fault . We 're innocent professional robbers . " <p> " You have a plan ? " <p> Inodded , ridiculously glad to be the one ahead this time . <p> YES , THEY HAD felt guilty . ( A glance at those carvings of theirs showed what they believed loitered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty little pawing squinting imps , only partly concealed by the foliage or curlicues of gracious living . ) <p> Yet when they made their sun , they were high as balloons on the joy of their talents , and what they could do . Possibly they built it on a whim , because they wanted long summer evenings that went on till dawn . But maybe they were afraid of the dark in their souls . <p> And perhaps that facilitated the thing which happened . Their own ever-present self-distrust . <p> They launched the Great Lantern and outlawed night from their City forever . More , they killed the night there . Then there could only be twilight , a sunrise , and another sunrise . <p> If this were a story , you might say the night became angry . Out of rage at this bit of itself having been slaughtered in the City , it raised up its dead and let it loose for vengeance . But night has never harbored resentment , that I ever heard . It was only that , from every bright light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laws of Balance which especially wages know very well . And their invented sun 's shadow took on their fear of themselves . The stronger any light , too , the blacker the shade it generates . The Great Lantern was incandescent and convincing - and false . So the shadow it started was deadly , ominous , negative - and alive . <p> Animate things straying into the City , beasts , birds , people , stirred it up . Very likely it would lie almost quiescent when no one was about . Yet despite its birth from an unreal sun , in the violent light of any sun therefore , the true sun - it must also be active . It was a shadow . <p> Not anything that gave light energized it ; some things were too weak . Although I thought the sparkle had , a little , at least attracted its attention . Solar light was its catalyst and inspirator . But frankly I would have taken no chances on a fully visible and lushly lit window , let alone the moon . Moonless dusk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that even if we had been able to stall until the following night , we would have stood not a chance . Tonight had been moonless . Tomorrow the moon was new . <p> Getting everything up the seventeen or eighteen staircases was quite a haul . We did it again in total darkness . That was the only way to be safe . <p> And at the top waited blasting fake daylight . And daylight 's Shadow . <p> When we reached the area behind the outer Arrival Room , we kept well back , because through the windows the sun was boring , shining it all up to gold . The Great Lantern gives a radiance resembling that kind of ripe , syrupy desert sunset people remark on and praise . I hate that sort of sunset now . <p> " Ready ? " he asked me . <p> " No . Let 's do it . " <p> Jade is always valuable . The black , white , and green jades for jewelry and statues . The purple jade is also beautiful but has other properties worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light , a scratching began like giant mice . It was Hassent and me , maniacally working with the two flint-and  --  tinders , setting the ends of endless shards of purple jade alight . Brittle and easily broken , the material catches very quickly . The jade grows red-hot in seconds , so one must be quick in spinning it away . There is no flame , only a thick magenta smoke . It has been used for approximately two centuries in the most unprincipled ways , during warfare , or to control popular riots when kings become aggrieved . The jade burns for hours , the smoke thickens and spreads . It smells nice , and chokes you , you can see nothing in it ; conversely , the damage to property is minimal , as no fire ever results . It is worth a fortune . We flung it back down the stairs , out over the Arrival Room , and , when the voluminous swirling miasma began to expand , advancing with the cloud , with our shirts tied over half our faces , we dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have heard them say , in the places they have used fire-conducting jade , called also so playfully , Plum-Breath , that it turned day to night , and put out the sun . <p> We put out the sun too , that sunny dead night in the City , Hass and I. Coughing and crowing , eyes streaming , and thinking we would probably anyway soon strangle and expire , we moved up the steps , over the plazas , along the boulevards , until we reached an outer wall . I can only guess how we climbed it , clinging retching and weeping on the ropes . But I said , I believe , he and I are strong . And the terror of certain death is always a wonderful incentive . <p> We got down the mountain wall too , only falling parts of the way , well-roped from practice , accumulating cuts , gashes , bruises , a cracked rib and chipped bone or two - nothing worth mentioning , really . Or I feel it is unworthy of mention , in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attacked . Nothing came near . <p> When we had got down in the valley , it was dawn . The sun rising was the actual sun . Staring back up , even if we could barely see with our tortured eyes , we beheld how the City of the magicians now perched under a chain of tiny umbrellas of Plum-Breath , which marked our escape route . The Great Lantern itself was invisible , then visible , coming and going as it sank . But we heard something somewhere , crying . They were etiolate cries of anguish and excruciation beyond human comprehending , endurance , or pity . <p> We lay around in the valley for a few days . We took turns vomiting , complaining , drinking the local streams dry . Gradually full sight returned , and some sanity . ( By then we had crawled on at least far enough not to have to see the City above , or its sun . ) Hassent and I told each other that we were on the mend , although we found out , the hard way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison of the jade had been voided . Before we left the area entirely , the smoke had mostly faded overhead , though it was obvious how far it had drifted . And the lamentation of the thing which haunted the City , that had faded at last too , though now and then , in the stillness - just now and then , even a hundred miles off as we then were - Unless maybe , it was an aural hallucination . <p> From the treasure city we had brought out not a single valuable . All we had carried was as much purple jade as we could , and we had spent all that to save our lives . What is life worth , after all ? To most of us , everything we have . <p> In the after days , trekking back , urt-less , over the desert toward civilization , we planned a dainty retribution on our helpful Source , who had experimentally sent us to die . We did not ever talk about the City . We never discussed either one ultimate thing- which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Lantern , the sun which had caused the creature of dead night . I will put this down , nevertheless , in case anyone ever thinks they would be doing us all a service ( and incidentally enabling themselves to become incredibly rich ) by smashing that unreal , second sun . Leave it alone ! Why ? Because the second sun is what keeps the creature in the City . If ever that disc goes out - all It will have left is the moon and the stars and the sun , and any other great lights of all this world outside . And then everywhere will be open to it , everywhere - and everyone of us . <p> Beware ! <p> Author Affiliation
