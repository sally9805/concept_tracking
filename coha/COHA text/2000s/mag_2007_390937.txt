PHOTOGRAPHY BY LAURA MOSS PRODUCED BY JENNIFER VREELAND WRITTEN BY MICHELE MEYER Come explore the Heights , a Houston neighborhood that looks and feels like a rural town despite being part of our nation 's fourth-largest city . You 'll find old-fashioned charm , history , friendly residents , ice cream shakes , and fabulous vintage finds  --  all at a relaxed pace . " In a city where so much has been torn down , it 's a testament to our neighborhood that its bungalows are still here almost 100 years later , " says resident Maura Cannon . Consider this a tale of two cities  --  the one , a collection of Victorian homes and Craftsman bungalows lovingly restored and well shaded under century-old oaks ; the other , quirky vintage boutiques and antiques shops in brick storefronts easily mistaken for a rural Main Street . Throw in artists and attorneys , lifelong residents , and well-heeled newcomers , and you 've got the Heights , a vibrant neighborhood that 's just minutes from downtown Houston . You 'll find great deals  --  and surprises  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture at Heights Antiques on Yale ; objets at Installations ; or boa-trimmed lamps at Retropolis . " You never know what you 'll find around the corner , " says local author David Welling . " The Heights has a wonderful charm to it . " THE HEIGHTS 'S shopping district  --  the 300 block of West 19th street  --  falls in the shadow of the neon marquee of the 81-year-old Heights cinema . People-watch from the patio of Cricket 's Creamery &Caffn++,; then stop by Retropolis for 1950s handbags , ' ' 70s beads , and ' ' 40s-inspired dresses . Travel back at 57-year-old Harolds in the Heights , where the owners still cater to clients craving bespoke suits and bench-made shoes . GETTING THERE : HOUSTON HEIGHTS The Heights  --  named for its rare elevation in Houston  --  was its own city until annexed in 1920 . Just three miles from the center of downtown , Houston Heights is bordered by I-610 to the north , North Main/Studewood to the east , I-10 to the south , and North Shepherd Drive to the west . Gilbert Perez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased a 1912 Arts and Crafts bungalow in 1996 , he intended only to remodel and rent it . Instead , he fell in love with the house and decided to move in . In 2003 , he launched Bungalow Revival to find , restore , and update fading neighborhood glories . " These houses have souls and stories to tell , " says Perez . " We 're doing a disservice by tearing them down to build huge Hummer homes .
