FAISALABAD , Pakistan  --  The mob was hungry . <p> Police had stopped hundreds of jobless Pakistanis from marching on the offices of the Faisalabad electric company , which they blamed for daily power outages . So the protesters went after the Treats bakery instead . <p> They hurled rocks through the windows and stormed the place , beating anyone who tried to stop them , throwing the owner down a flight of stairs , looting the cash register and grabbing cookies , cakes and loaves of bread . " They put their anguish on us , " store manager Muhammad Shafiq recalls . " Whatever food they found , they ate it . " <p> A month later , some of the windows at Treats have n't been repaired . Customers have returned , but many employees bear physical scars from the assault . Worst of all , Shafiq fears poverty is rising so fast in this city of 2 million people that conditions are ripe for another riot . " The unrest will continue , " he predicts , " until the problems are solved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early days of the Obama administration , the global economic crisis is making combustible countries such as Pakistan even more of a security risk to the United States and its troops abroad . The fear here , and in other parts of the Muslim world , is that unrest over soaring unemployment and food shortages could cause unpopular governments to collapse , resulting in more support for militant organizations such as al-Qaeda or the Taliban . <p> " If the economy goes down , the militants benefit , " says retired army lieutenant general Talat Masood , a prominent Pakistani political analyst . " If the economy was strong , many things would take care of themselves . " <p> Even before the economic mess took hold , Pakistan was one of President Obama ' s biggest foreign-policy headaches . <p> Despite receiving more than $11 billion in U.S. aid since the 9/11 terror attacks , its fragile government has been unable to stop Islamic extremists based on its soil from launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan , where Obama announced plans last week to send an additional 17,000 U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also were responsible for November 's assault on two hotels and other landmarks in Mumbai , India , which killed 170 people and raised the prospect of war between the two nuclear-armed rivals . <p> Now , as the financial crisis chokes off trade and the flow of money to all corners of the world , " a lack of job opportunities may increase the incentives for many young Pakistani men to join militant groups , " according to a recent report by the Center for American Progress , a Washington think tank . The report also warned that support for beleaguered Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari " could quickly erode . " <p> Obama has urged Pakistan to do more to eradicate " safe havens " for militants , and earlier this month he sent Richard Holbrooke , his new special envoy to the region , to Islamabad to press for action . Pakistani officials responded by asking for more military funding and urgent economic aid . <p> Pakistan 's economy is slowing dramatically  --  from growth of 6% or more in recent years to just 0.6% in 2008 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in a country with a youthful and rapidly growing population of 173 million , anything less than 3% growth amounts to a recession , Pakistani economist Mohsin Khan warns . <p> Meanwhile , the cash-strapped government has fallen behind on payments to power companies , leading to the electrical blackouts that sparked the riots in Faisalabad and have chilled economic activity even further . <p> The fallout from the blackouts was clear one recent day outside a factory in Faisalabad , where Muhammad Ashiq and some weary colleagues were waiting next to a pool of stagnant water , hoping the electricity would come back on . Since the outages started eating into the plant 's working hours , Ashiq 's previous wages of 6,000 Pakistani rupees a month  --  about $75  --  have been cut in half . <p> " It is terrible , " Ashiq says . Half his reduced income goes to rent on his house , and the soaring cost of electricity takes up most of the rest . <p> As food prices also rise , Ashiq has been getting his groceries on credit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't blame them : " They are broke , " he says with a shrug . " We are broke . " <p> Poor feel squeeze <p> The situation was similar 230 miles to the north in Rawalpindi , twin city to the capital Islamabad . Machinist Muhammad Shafiq ( no relation to the store manager in Faisalabad ) was sitting in the chilly darkness of his engine repair shop , waiting for the power to come back on . " We are doing nothing , " said Shafiq , 62 . <p> Such stories help explain why , in a survey conducted last fall for the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group , 73% of 3,500 Pakistani adults said their personal finances had deteriorated over the previous year , and 59% expected things to get worse . <p> Asked to name the country 's No. 1 problem , 58% picked inflation and 12% chose unemployment . Just 10% of those polled cited the recent wave of suicide bombings that has hit Pakistani cities as militant groups try to destabilize the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paying 2 1/2 times as much for wheat as they did in April 2007 , according to the government . Palm oil , which is instrumental for cooking here , has tripled in cost during that time . <p> The economic distress has hit hard in Faisalabad and the surrounding countryside . This is Pakistan 's heartland and the center of its textile industry , which accounts for more than 60% of the country 's exports . Workers in their traditional shalwar kameez  --  tunics worn over baggy pants  --  pour in from the countryside to take jobs weaving , sewing and dyeing fabrics . <p> When work is plentiful , they send the bulk of their earnings back to their families . These days , work is scarce and getting scarcer . In the village of Fakharabad , unemployment is running at 80% , estimates Muhammad Anwar , a former factory manager who lost his job in December . <p> People there are not accustomed to poverty : Muhammad Mushtaq , 21 , had earned $100 a month  --  a decent salary here  --  for the previous four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now his family is getting by on homegrown wheat and on credit from Fakharabad 's general store . <p> " We 're starving to death , " Mushtaq says . " How can I be happy ? " <p> Anwar sees even more problems ahead : " Because of the abrupt , increasing and severe joblessness , problems could emerge , " he says . " Young guys can turn to crime . " <p> Anwar says that , because they follow a moderate form of Islam , Fakharabad villagers have n't been lured by Islamic militant groups . Even so , patience with the government in Islamabad is waning : " The entire economy is in crisis , and the government is sleeping , " says Ejaz Ahmed , owner of a Faisalabad cotton-cycling plant . <p> ' Like a blessing from God <p> Elsewhere in Pakistan , though , Islamic extremists are making headway in winning support . <p> In Muridke , 75 miles northeast of Faisalabad , a charity affiliated with the extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba  --  which the Pakistani government says was responsible for the Mumbai terrorist attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ud Dawah , which the U.S. Congressional Research Service calls an " incarnation " of Lashkar , runs a hospital in Muridke for the poor . <p> " For us , they are like a blessing from God , " shopkeeper Abdul Hameed says . " In this era of high inflation , poor people ca n't afford to seek medical treatment , even for kids . " <p> Even in bad times , Pakistani militant groups draw donations from sympathizers across the country and in the oil-rich Middle East ; some also make money from criminal enterprises . " Their economy does n't go down  --  their narcotics , their smuggling , their kidnappings , " Masood says . <p> " The militants have plenty of money and can simply offer either income to the unemployed or a better income " for those who have jobs , says Shaun Gregory , director of the Pakistan Security Research Unit at Britain 's University of Bradford . And joining militant groups also " carries much great status and honor than most menial jobs . " <p> In Pakistan 's Swat Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so powerful that the government decided this month to stop military offensives there . <p> It 's unclear whether Pakistan 's government is capable of reversing the rot . Most other governments in the world  --  from New Delhi to Seoul to Washington  --  have reacted to the economic crisis by slashing interest rates , cutting taxes and pumping up spending on infrastructure . Pakistan is doing just the opposite , though : raising interest rates and cutting government spending . <p> Those are the terms of a $7.5 billion loan it secured in November from the International Monetary Fund , which demanded Pakistan 's government control its budget deficit and bring inflation down from its 20% pace . The IMF acknowledged that the " measures could further intensify existing social tensions . " <p> One solution would be to collect more taxes , but that 's not easy in a country that , in a recent ranking of perceived corruption levels by the Berlin-based organization Transparency International , came in 134th among 180 countries , with 180th being the most corrupt . Meanwhile , cutting defense spending is next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years of rule by a military junta  --  especially at a time when the Taliban is on the rise and tensions are running high with rival India . <p> So the government is reportedly tightening social spending  --  on just the kind of projects that could help ease poverty in the short and longer term . According to the newspaper Dawn , the government spent less than $900 million of the $2.5 billion it had expected to on development in the second half of 2008 . <p> " We 're creating a problem for ourselves , " says Fasih Uddin , retired chief economist for the Pakistani government and author of a book criticizing IMF policies toward Pakistan . " Raising interest rates when everyone else is cutting ? The world economy is in recession right now . ... Defense spending can not be cut . What is left is development expenditure  --  health , education , power , sanitation . They are being gutted . " <p> Some miss military rule <p> Meanwhile , Zardari 's hold on power is weakening . The widower of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she was assassinated . But the IRI poll last fall showed that 63% of Pakistanis disapproved of his performance . Only 19% said they 'd support his Peoples Party if there was another election , down from 50% in January 2008 . <p> That 's bad news in a country where democracy has a tenuous grip . For more than half its 61-year existence , Pakistan has been governed by the army , including the nine-year regime of former president Pervez Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 coup . <p> Some Pakistanis even miss military rule , fewer than six months after the unpopular Musharraf was forced out . " A military government at least is organized , " says Mian Muhammad Shabbir , who owns a textile spinning mill outside the Punjabi city Lahore . <p> Gregory , author of the forthcoming book Pakistan : Securing the Insecure State , believes the crisis could deteriorate quickly : " If the demonstrations grow in number and frequency and the government ca n't address food and fuel issues in particular , then a momentum against the government might build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military  --  which proved largely ineffective at combating militants under Musharraf  --  could try to seize power . He says the key will be whether there are more incidents such as the one at the Treats bakery . He says the Punjab region 's recent volatility is a " test " for what might be to come . <p> In Faisalabad , Gulzar Ahmed , a 70-year-old worker at a cotton recycling plant , sees only dark days ahead . His monthly income has plunged by half . <p> " I 'm fed up , " he says , his face covered with the white lint that floats around the factory . " Everyone is angry . " <p> Contributing : Zafar M.
