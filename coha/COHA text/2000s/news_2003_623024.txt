<p> Billionaire Gordon Getty gave San Francisco supervisor and mayoral candidate Gavin Newsom a $1 million real estate loan with such generous terms that experts say it may put Newsom in conflict with California 's clean government law . <p> Though Newsom described the loan as market-rate , mortgage experts consulted by The Chronicle said no commercial lender could afford to offer him such a deal . <p> And while Newsom contends the loan passes legal muster , experts on the Political Reform Act  --  including the law 's co-author , and a former enforcement chief for the state agency that enforces it  --  said the loan discount appeared to violate tough legal limits on gifts to politicians . <p> A spokeswoman for the enforcement agency , the state Fair Political Practices Commission , declined comment . <p> The Getty loan was a third mortgage on the $3 million Pacific Heights home purchased nearly two years ago by Newsom and his wife , Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom . It 's a five-year loan , with fixed 5.12 percent interest , no payment due for a year and annual payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsom said that the interest he pays to Getty , who is a friend and investor in the supervisor 's San Francisco businesses , was " a little high " compared to what was available on the open market . <p> But mortgage experts said a lender would demand a far higher rate to secure a third mortgage for $1 million . <p> The loan Newsom described " is n't a normal real estate loan , " said John Karevoll , an analyst at DataQuick , a San Diego firm that tracks mortgage trends . <p> " . . . If you were to go out there and put this kind of loan on this kind of deal , you would pay twice that . " <p> In July 2001 , such a third mortgage would have commanded 10 to 15 percent interest , he said . <p> ESTIMATED $40,000 SAVINGS <p> At those rates , the Getty loan is saving Newsom $40,000 a year , according to calculations obtained from the Mortgagecalculator.com financial Web site . <p> The Political Reform Act bars elected officials from accepting any gift worth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Violators can be fined . <p> The money that Newsom has saved via the discounted loan is " clearly a gift " under terms of the law , said Robert Stern , president of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles and Political Reform Act co-author . <p> Roger Brown , a lawyer and former state clean-government enforcement chief , agreed with Stern , saying that if an official gets a loan on more generous terms than are available to the general public , the law treats the discount as a gift . <p> " If he paid less than fair market for it , or got it on terms not available to the public generally , then the difference is a gift , " Brown said . <p> Getty did n't respond to a phone call seeking comment on this story . Last month , in a written response to a query about terms of the loan , Getty told The Chronicle : " I have made loans to Gavin , as I would to my own sons . " <p> Newsom , through his lawyer and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintained that the state gift rules did n't apply . <p> The lawyer , Jim Sutton , said that in setting the rate on the loan , Getty had consulted an IRS publication called the Applicable Federal Rates table , which determines when federal gift taxes are due on below-market loans given by lenders to family members and friends . <p> THE GIFT THRESHOLD <p> Sutton said that at the time the loan was made , IRS tables showed that loans at less than 5.12 percent interest  --  the rate of Getty 's loan to Newsom  --  were below market-rate and subject to gift taxes . <p> Because it met the IRS threshold , the Getty loan was a " ' market rate ' ( loan ) explicitly sanctioned by the IRS , " Sutton wrote in a statement . Because the IRS does n't define it as a gift , he said , neither should state law . <p> " This loan is a transaction between two people who knew each other and relied on the IRS to set a fair rate that was , by definition , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement . <p> Sutton also said that a technician at the Fair Political Practices Commission whom he telephoned had told him the agency was " inclined to agree " with this view . The technician , Kevin Moen , declined to speak to a reporter . Spokeswoman Sigrid Bathen said the commission as a matter of policy does n't comment on legal advice it gives verbally , or on the specifics of potential cases . <p> But experts said the IRS table cited by Newsom does n't reflect interest rates on the open market  --  and thus was n't relevant to determining whether a loan violates the state gift law . <p> The prime lending rate in July 2001 was 6.75 percent , more than 1.5 points higher than the IRS line Newsom cited , tax experts noted . <p> " You ca n't go to your lender and receive a loan based on the Applicable Federal Rates table , " said Robert Sommers , a San Francisco tax attorney . <p> DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES <p> Both Stern and Brown , the legal experts , said federal gift tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform Act . <p> Brown said that under state law , the relevant issue in deciding whether a loan involves a gift is , " Did the politician get something of value that was not available to the public generally ? " <p> Because it does n't reflect market rates , the IRS table is n't relevant to that question , he said . <p> Getty , heir to the Getty oil fortune , is a lifelong friend of Newsom 's father and is lead investor in Newsom 's PlumpJack Cafe and other businesses . <p> The Getty loan was the third of three mortgages that Newsom obtained when he bought his home in July 2001 . Public records show that Newsom also obtained a $1 million first mortgage from Northern Trust Bank and a $350,000 second mortgage from the seller . The Getty loan became a second mortgage last year when Newsom paid off the loan from the seller by refinancing the first mortgage . <p> The Getty loan required a lump sum annual payment on the anniversary of the loan , according to Jaye , Newsom 's campaign manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaye said . <p> In July 2001 , when Getty made the loan , the average interest rate on 30-year , fixed-rate mortgages was 7.31 percent , according to statistics compiled by the HSH Associates financial publishing firm . At the time , Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Co. advertised a five-year fixed " jumbo loan " at 6.25 percent  --  and those were for first mortgages . <p> A RISKY PROPOSITION <p> Third mortgages cost more because they 're riskier for the lender , said Stephen Leidner , president of the California Mortgage Association . <p> " Third mortgages require a higher rate of interest for the holder of the third in order to protect his investment , " said Leidner , who also is president of Lantern Financial Corp . in Sherman Oaks ( Los Angeles County ) . " I recently wrote a third at 12 3/4 percent , and that was a very good rate . " Rates are lower today than they were in 2001 , he noted . <p> Karevoll , the DataQuick analyst , said he doubted that any conventional lender would make a $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To get such a loan , " you would probably have to go to the so-called hard money market , " he said , referring to private lenders who charge premium interest on loans that are unavailable elsewhere . <p> Another expert queried by The Chronicle , Bruce Honaker , loan officer at Pleasant Hill 's QFI Financial , said if he offered a customer a loan on those terms , " My boss would throw me out of the office .
