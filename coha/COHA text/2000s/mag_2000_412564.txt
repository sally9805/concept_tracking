I wanted a new bike this year . No. that 's not exactly right . I decided I to buy a new bike this year . That 's a difference we 've all lived . We cyclists perpetually want new bikes . Sometimes we want a whole new kind-maybe one of the full-suspension cross-country bikes now that the designers finally have that figured out , or something to commute on and park outside the grocery store , or something with more gears , or something lighter and stiffer to get us in the mix on the long climb . Sometimes the new bike we want is n't new except to us . I still regret walking away from a rural yard sale without a track bike that seemed as if Major Taylor could have ridden it . And do n't all cyclists have the dream of owning a bike made the year we were born ? Sometimes that new bike is our own bike , just made fresh with fenders for rain , or with handlebar wrap or new tires . Whatever the form , we want new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character fault to apologize for . Our sport is as much about gear as it is about rides and muscles and oxygen . Would one route to ride-or three or ten-be enough ? Should our passion for riding peak when the first striation of muscle shows on our calves ? Why should we stop desiring new bikes ? But sometimes that ongoing , inherent want becomes more . This was my year . I changed my riding style slightly-a little more spin , a little more aggressive climbing ( jumps instead of constant grinds ) , not as many miles but more days on the bike . Something altered in that wonderfully complex synthesis that 's invisible when our relationship with our bike is perfect . The frame I 'd ridden happily for six years felt wrong . It had been awhile , anyway-I was still running a Sachs road group and ti-spoked wheels . I did all the things we do . Checked with friends who 'd bought bikes . Compared spec online , talked to shop guys . I dogeared catalog pages ( and our April Buyer 's Guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified everything to myself and my wife , and saved the dough . And I bought a lawn mower . A big , fast lawn mower . Why ? You know already . Because even if I 'm a cyclist first and an earthling second . sometimes second beats first here on earth . It 's not a tragedy . The mower chopped my cutting time from 3 hours to 90 minutes . That 's more ride time on weekends . I told myself-and it 's worked out that way . mostly . There 's no grand point to this . except that while I mow I think about the bike I did n't buy . about us wanting new bikes all the time but really committing to get one far less often than the people who do n't understand our passion might imagine . And that how . sometimes even after we commit , we do n't get the bike . And that just as we should n't feel bad for the wanting . we should n't feel bad when we get nothing . Both things are just us being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
