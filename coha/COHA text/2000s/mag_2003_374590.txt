Had enough of lean cuisine ? Get ready to savor the dessert restaurant , which offers multi-course meals consisting of nothing but sweets . At Sugar , a swanky dessert bar in Chicago , a menu might include a palate-cleansing roasted-quince-in-cider soup ( $6 ) , followed by pomegranate gelatin with tangerine sorbet ( $6 ) and Macdeth by Chocolate ( $15 ) . Boston 's Finale does offer " pre-dessert " items , such as salads , but they 're slipped onto the back of the menu so that diners can focus on delicacies like a Chocolate Indulgence tasting plate for two ( $30 ) .
