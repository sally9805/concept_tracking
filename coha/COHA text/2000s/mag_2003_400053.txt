Model Peggy Dillard and her husband , artist Lloyd Toone , restore a historic brownstone Headnote home harlem rising // WHEN PEGGY DILLARD AND LLOYD TOONE WENT HOUSE HUNTING IN HARLEM IN 1980 , THE neighborhood had seen better days . " You had a lot of desolation and vacant buildings , " recalls Peggy . That might have scared away more timid souls . But because the Toones and people like them persevered-people who were committed , resourceful , talented and passionate about Black culture  --  Harlem is enjoying a much-touted renewal . The two are , in fact , a kind of renaissance couple . Peggy , whose natural beauty has graced the covers of ESSENCE , Mademoiselle , Cosmopolitan and Vogue , is also a singer , actor , art dealer , painter , interior designer , entrepreneur and construction consultant . Lloyd is an artist and art educator who has also been an antiques dealer , refinisher and restorer . When they decided to set up house in New York City , they went looking for a place in Harlem primarily because they loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the overpriced Upper West Side , where Lloyd was living , or Greenwich Village , Peggy 's former neighborhood . In the Mount Morris section just south of 125th Street near Lenox Avenue , they discovered a five-story 1887 brownstone being sold by Mary Williams , a woman from St. Kitts who had divided it into apartments and moved in her entire family from the island . " We was livin ' ' , " Miss Mary liked to say about what she considered palatial digs . But she eventually grew tired of being a landlady . After the Toones bought the brownstone ( Peggy wo n't say for how much , but admits many houses were still available for less than $100,000 ) , they gradually helped most tenants , including Miss Mary , move into other apartments in the neighborhood .

" We inherited history . " The building began revealing its past slowly . They knew that the original owners had been Jewish , but were surprised to find , under eight layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set into the kitchen floor . Lloyd taught some men on the block to strip wood , and before long all the oak and pine floors and grand architectural details had been uncovered . Peggy did n't want to re-create the cluttered , stuffy period decor normally associated with Harlem . " When I think of decoration , I think of the architecture of a space , " she says . " I do n't like to overdress it with fabrics and lots of stuff . " She refinished some of the furniture left by the previous tenants and added her own pieces here and there . In the back parlor there are just one small sofa , two chairs , a scattering of occasional tables and an old Chickering concert grand from a ballroom downtown . The bedrooms are similarly spare-beds , a bureau , a mirror , perhaps a writing table . That 's it : luxury of space . Lloyd 's paintings and mixed-media sculpture are displayed throughout the house , with many works in the front parlor , which is known as the Indasa Gallery and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 20 years , the Toones still feel the house is evolving . Peggy says the brownstone itself sets the pace of their renovations ; it " tells " her what it needs . It 's obvious that in some rooms the house has felt a stronger makeover urge than in others . Lloyd 's studio on the top floor , for example , remains quite raw , and the kitchen is much as it was at the turn of the century . " I 'd like to take the kitchen to a whole other level , " Peggy says , " but it does n't let you . This house just sort of controls you . " <p>
