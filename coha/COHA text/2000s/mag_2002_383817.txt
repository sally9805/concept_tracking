Because MS strikes after adult life has begun , and disabilities are often felt only much later on , many who become disabled from MS are simply unprepared . Suddenly a person may need bathtub railings . A kitchen or garage develops obstacles . Using a scooter requires a ramp . Simultaneously , income might be shrinking or even disappearing . A lot of us do not know how to begin to look for help . Nobody should have to live in a home that is inaccessible to them , and nobody should have to leave a home if simple structural changes can prevent that loss . There is money for accessibility modifications out there . There are also many people who volunteer their time and skills to help people who become disabled to maintain independent lives . Call your insurance company If you are insured , a call to your health insurance company is the first step to take . Your policy may provide for medically necessary structural changes as well as equipment . When calling , have paper and pencil handy to write down your representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel that the answers are not accurate or complete , ask to speak with a supervisor Funding modifications to a home may be complex from the insurer 's point of view , so speaking with a manager can be much more useful than speaking with a less knowledgeable customer service rep . If coverage for home modifications is not available under your policy , do n't lose heart . // Call the IRS ! You may be eligible for a tax break . Although the federal tax code is not fun or easy to decipher , it is an important resource . Telephone the IRS . The listing is usually found in the U.S. Government Offices section of your telephone book under Internal Revenue Service . Or contact the IRS on the Web at &lt;www.irs. gov&gt; . Then ask for or download the instructions for Schedule R or Schedule 3 , Credit for the Elderly or Disabled . ( Try not to pay attention to how that sounds . ) Within these instructions is a form for your doctor to fill out . It states that you are disabled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement does not have to be sent to the IRS with your return , but it must be kept with your tax records to prove , in case you are ever audited , that you are eligible for deductions and credits you have taken . Even if it 's not tax time , ask for a copy of Publication 907 , Tax Highlights for the Disabled , as well . Although it 's no page-turner , it contains references to all of the major tax credits and deductions that might be of use to you , including itemized deductions for medically necessary modifications to a home or vehicle and workrelated accommodations . If you need help dealing with these regulations , the IRS itself may be helpful , but surprisingly , they do not have any specialists in disability tax law on staff Call the ILC !

I 'm also saying it because it was true . <p> We met about two weeks into our freshman year at SMU . I was majoring in biological sciences with the intent of getting into a good med school and she was getting a bachelor 's degree in elementary education  --  she wanted to be a teacher . That seemed so sweet to me at the time . She was actually going to college to learn how to be a good teacher . I had a few teachers I liked along the way , but I 'll never forget overhearing Mr. Campbell , my high school history teacher , telling Mrs. Baude , my high school calculus teacher , that he started teaching because it was the only job he could get and twenty-five years later it was the only job he could keep . I always kind of figured that 's how most teachers became teachers , but she was actively pursuing the career . It was almost noble . <p> Classes had just barely started . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to some first classes yet because the had n't been held . I was sitting in my dorm room in McElvaney , talking to my roommate , Dave , about some stupid bullshit like how he could n't wait to get back home for Christmas so he could get some of his mom 's cooking or some other inconsequential crap . Actually , maybe he was talking about which frats he wanted to try to get into the following semester . I had no interest in joining a frat , which he tried to convince me was the biggest mistake I would ever make . Later I found out he was a born-again Christian , and when he found out I did n't go to church or subscribe to any religion he tried to convince me that burning in hell was almost as big a mistake as not getting into a frat . Anyway , whatever we were talking about got interrupted when we both heard a thud followed by some whimpering in the hallway outside our door . We went out to see what in the hell was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition . <p> Heather had apparently been too drunk to walk and had used her friend as a human crutch as they both stumbled back to McElvaney from whatever party they were at . Once they were in the hallway , her friend passed out , they both fell down , and Heather smashed her head against the wall . She had a small cut on her forehead and she was kind of crying or moaning  --  just making weird low noises , really . I remember genuinely feeling bad for her . <p> I asked her if she was okay and she said , " I need to lay down , I think . " <p> She was hot as hell , there 's no question about that . But there was something about her , something beyond just looking good , that attracted me to her almost immediately . I had a few girlfriends in high school I thought were cute or whatever , but not like this . I know it 's gay , but it was her eyes or something . I do n't know . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there was some kind of immediate attraction that was n't like anything I 'd ever felt . So , seeing a hot chick in need of aid , I did what any normal guy would have done . Actually I did what any pussy-ass chump would have done . I helped her up and asked if I could take her back to her room , with no intention of making any kind of move on her . <p> She said , " What floor are we on ? " <p> I said , " Third . " <p> " I think my room is on two . I ca n't really walk anymore . Where 's your room ? " <p> I said , " Right here . " <p> As Heather went into my room I tried to get her friend up off the floor , but when I reached down and touched her arm she started yelling , " Get your fucking hands off me , asshole . " Then she launched a halfhearted punch at my balls that kind of glanced off my thigh . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer me some help in wrangling her friend , but she was already in my room , on my bed . Not wanting to risk another nut-shot , I just left her friend there , assuming she 'd sober up and find her way back to her room . <p> I essentially could have done anything I wanted to Heather that night , but it did n't even cross my mind . I took off her shoes , went down the hall and ran some warm water over a washrag in the bathroom , came back , cleaned the blood off her forehead , put a Band-Aid on the cut , pulled up the covers , and  --  get this shit  --  I went to sleep on the fucking floor so she 'd be more comfortable . <p> I remember Dave just pretending to go to sleep . At the time I really did n't know why , but after I found out about how Christian he was I thought it might have had something to do with breaking some rule against God or something by having a girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy . <p> The next morning was awkward at best . Heather woke up before I did . She nudged me and then we introduced ourselves . <p> She said something like , " Hi . I 'm Heather . " <p> I said something like , " I 'm Kyle . " <p> " Did we . . . I hate having to actually ask this , but did we have sex last night ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Oh , I thought we . . . Are you sure ? " <p> " Yeah . Positive . I think I would have remembered . " <p> " I thought we were both drunk , though . I just want to make sure in case we did n't use any protection , you know , so I can get a morning-after pill . " <p> This was our first official conversation and she was basically telling me that she was so slutty that standard operations for her involved being unable to remember having sex with a guy five hours after his dick was in her followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this did n't even tip me off at all that this chick was bad fucking news . <p> <br> Continues ...
