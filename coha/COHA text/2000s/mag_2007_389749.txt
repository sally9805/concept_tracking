Headnote Use these natural methods to build healthier soil . Starting a new garden is n't difficult . Most people begin by going out into their yards with a shovel or garden tiller , digging up the ground and putting in a few plants . Add a little mulch or compost , and you 're well on your way to homegrown vegetables . But in the long run , the success of your garden depends on healthy soil . The more you can do to keep your soil healthy , the more productive your garden will be and the higher the quality of your crops . In the last issue , I discussed the value of soil care methods that imitate natural soil communities . These include protecting soil structure , feeding the soil with nutrients from natural and local sources , and increasing the diversity and numbers of the microbes and other organisms that live in the soil . In this article , I 'll focus on specific ways to achieve these goals . There are many ways to do this , but they all revolve around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to increase organic matter and mineral availability , and whenever possible , you should avoid tilling the soil and leave its structure undisturbed . ADD ORGANIC MATTER For the best soil , sources of organic matter should be as diverse as possible . 1 . Add manures for nitrogen . All livestock manures can be valuable additions to soil-their nutrients are readily available to soil organisms and plants . In fact , manures make a greater contribution to soil aggregation than composts , which have already mostly decomposed . You should apply manure with care . Although pathogens are less likely to be found in manures from homesteads and small farms than those from large confinement livestock operations , you should allow three months between application and harvest of root crops or leafy vegetables such as lettuce and spinach to guard against contamination . ( Tall crops such as corn and trellised tomatoes should n't be prone to contamination . ) However , because some nutrients from manures are so readily available , they are more likely to leach out of the soil ( where they 're needed ) into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , if manures are overused , they can provide excess amounts of some nutrients , especially phosphorus . Because of this , it may be best to restrict fresh manures to heavy feeding , fast-growing crops like corn , and process additional manure by composting . When thinking of manure , it 's worth considering our own . Flushing " humanure " away disrupts aquatic ecosystems , and represents a net loss of potential fertility from agricultural soils . On the other hand , human manure requires cautious management to avoid spreading disease . I recommend Joe Jenkins ' The Humanure Handbook , the bible on this subject . 2 . Try composting . Composting is a means of recycling almost any organic wastes . It reduces the bulk of organic materials , stabilizes their more volatile and soluble nutrients , and speeds up the formation of soil humus . Regular applications of modest amounts of compost - one-quarter inch per season-will provide slow-release nutrients , which will dramatically improve your soil 's water retention and help suppress disease . Classic composting is relatively simple ( for more about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Page 46 ) , but it can be labor intensive if you try to do it on a large scale . The older I get , the more interested I am in an easier alternative . Fortunately , I 've found two . One is " sheet composting . " In classic composting , you build tall piles in bins , alternating layers of fresh , high-nitrogen " greens , " such as grass clippings , with high-carbon , difficult to break down " browns , " such as dry leaves . Instead , you can keep these two compost materials separate , and apply them in two layers directly to the garden bed . The moist , volatile , high-nitrogen " greens " go down first , in direct contact with the soil and the microbial populations ready to feed on them , while the drier , coarser , high-carbon " browns " are used as a cover to keep the first layer from drying out or losing its more volatile elements to the atmosphere . The second alternative is vermicomposting : using earthworms to convert nutrient-dense materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residues , into forms usable by plants . Earthworm castings are a major part of my fertility program . I started vermicomposting with a 3-by-4 foot worm bin . Then last year , I converted the center of my greenhouse to a 4-by-40 foot series of bins , 16 inches deep . My worms process horse manure by the pickup load from a neighbor . Not only do the worm castings feed plant roots , they carry a huge load of beneficial microbes that boost the soil organism community . 3 . Tap chicken power to mix organic materials into the soil . Typically , I use electric net fencing to manage my chickens , rotating them from place to place on pasture . When needed , however , I " park " them on one of my garden spaces . I dump whatever organic materials I have handy in piles , and the chickens happily do what they love best-scratch ceaselessly through that material , looking for interesting things to eat . In the process , they shred it and incorporate it into the top couple inches of soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scratched in as well , and they give a big boost to the soil microbes. 4 . " Mine " soil nutrients with deep rooted plants . As I explained in the previous article , when you first start gardening , it may be necessary to use rock powders , and other slow-release sources of minerals , to correct mineral deficiencies in the soil . In the long run , however , you can supply minerals without purchasing inputs . The organic materials we add to our soil supply most of the minerals healthy crops need . In addition , we plant " fertility patches " to grow a lot of our own mineral supplements . These fertility patches include plants that function as " dynamic accumulators . " That is , their roots grow deep , and " mine " mineral reserves from the deeper layers of subsoil , where it has weathered out of the parent rock . The roots of comfrey , for instance , can grow 8 to 10 feet into the subsoil . Stinging nettle is another extremely useful dynamic accumulator . Both nettle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in nitrogen . They make excellent additions to a compost heap or can be used as mulches . If you have some pasture , think of it as a fertility patch par excellence . When growth is fast and lush in the spring , you should be able to take one or two cuttings , perhaps even more , for use in composting or as mulches . If you do n't have a pasture , consider using parts of your lawn instead . I overseed my lawns each fall with the same sort of grass/clover mix I use on the pasture . In the spring , I allow some areas to grow about 8 or 10 inches before cutting it with the scythe and using it for fertility applications elsewhere . A final thought about fertility patches : Many gardeners are a bit paranoid about " weeds , " but some weeds are deep rooted , and can be used like comfrey as dynamic accumulators to bring minerals up from the deep subsoil . An example is yellow dock ( Rumex crispus ) . Why not allow some yellow dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is not in the way ? When the plants start to make seed heads , cut them off just above the crown to prevent huge numbers of seeds from blowing loose in the garden , then use the plants in mulches or composts. 5 . Plant cover crops . Growing cover crops is perhaps the most valuable strategy we can adopt to feed our soil , build up its fertility and improve its structure with each passing season . Freshly killed cover crops provide readily available nutrients for our soil microbe friends and hence for food crop plants . Plus , the channels opened up by the decaying roots of cover crops permit oxygen and water to penetrate the soil . Legumes ( clovers , alfalfa , beans and peas ) are especially valuable cover crops , because they fix nitrogen from the atmosphere into forms available : to crop plants . Mixes of different cover crops are often beneficial . For example , in mixes of grasses and clovers , the grasses add a large amount of biomass and improve soil structure because of the size and complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help break down the relatively carbon-rich grass roots quickly . Try to work cover crops into your cropping plans with the same deliberation that you bring to food crops . The easy way to do so is to maintain two separate garden spaces : Plant one to food crops and one to cover crops , then alternate the two crops in the following year . But most gardeners can not devote that much space to such a strategy , so effective cover cropping must be fitted into a unified garden plan , a concept that in practice can get fiendishly complex . Gardeners who like jigsaw puzzles will love the challenges . There are cover crops that work best for each of the four seasons , and for almost any cropping strategy . For a few options to try , see Page 50 . FIND ALTERNATIVES TO TILLAGE In last issue 's article , " Build Better Garden Soil , " I discussed ways excessive tillage is detrimental to soil life and contributes to greenhouse gases . Proper soil care reduces the need for tillage . Nurturing soil life by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil structure . Protect that improved structure by keeping the soil covered at all times . Repeat after me : " No bare soil ! " 6 . Cover the soil with mulch . An obvious way to keep the soil covered is to use organic mulches . Some people advise against using high-carbon materials such as straw or leaves , since soil microbes " rob " available nitrogen from the soil in order to break down the excess amounts of carbon . This is only true , however , if we incorporate these high-carbon sources into the soil . I once tilled in some coarse compost containing large amounts of oak leaves not yet fully decomposed , and found that crops grew quite poorly there the entire season . However , if high-carbon materials are laid down on top of soil as mulches , there wo n't be any problem . The mulch retains soil moisture and protects against temperature extremes . Microbes , earthworms and other forms of soil life can " nibble " at the mulch , and slowly incorporate their residues into the topsoil . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decompose readily , since they persist longer before being incorporated into the soil food web . ( Every gardener who has used mulches knows the story : You put down a thick layer early in the season , then suddenly one day notice-the garden ate my mulch ! ) Even so , it is usually necessary to renew mulches that are in place for the entire growing season . It is often recommended to turn manures and composts into the soil , but to reduce tillage you can apply the manure or compost on the soil surface , and keep it from drying out ( hence degrading ) with a thick high-carbon mulch ( along the lines of " sheet composting , " described above ) . Grass clippings should not be lost as a resource - shipping them off to the landfill is a true crime against sustainability . Grass-clippings mulch in paths can be slippery underfoot , and unpleasant to work on . I prefer to let lawn or pasture grasses grow to 8 to 12 inches , then cut them with a scythe , rake them up after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An undervalued source of organic matter is the wood fiber in newspapers and cardboard . All the reading I 've done on the subject convinces me that modern newsprint in this country , and cardboard produced in the United States and Europe , do not pose environmental hazards . When establishing " kill mulches " ( mulches over a living grass sod intended to kill it in preparation for planting trees and shrubs ) , I lay down a thick layer of newspaper or cardboard , then cover with leaves , grass cuttings and other organic materials . Wood chips also make good mulch for some situations , especially for pathways and kill mulches , and they often are free from tree-trimming services . 7 . Use permanent beds and paths . A key strategy for protecting soil structure is to grow in wide permanent beds and restrict foot traffic to the pathways-thus avoiding compaction in the growing areas - and to plant as closely as possible in the beds . Close planting shades the soil surface , which benefits both soil life and plants by conserving moisture and moderating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mulches , or mulch the paths and take advantage of foot traffic to help shred or grind materials such as straw or leaves . From time to time , this finely shredded material can be transferred to the beds , where it will break down much more readily than in its coarser forms . 8 . Try low-tech tillage . There are almost always better alternatives to tillage , especially power tillage , which inverts and mixes the different layers in the soil profile , disrupts the soil food web and breaks down the " crumb " structure we have worked so hard to achieve . Even in the case of cover crops , which must give way to the planting of a harvest crop , it is not necessary to turn them into the soil , as usually recommended . Instead , consider these alternatives . You can bury the cover crop under a heavy mulch to kill it . If the soil is in loose , friable condition , it is easy to pull the cover plants up by the roots and lay them on the bed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to kill without tillage , but cutting them immediately above the crowns after seed stalks or flowers form will kill them . Use the upper ends of the plants as a mulch to help break down the roots more rapidly . If you have chickens , you can use them to till in your cover crops . They cause some disruption of soil life , but only in the top couple of inches . The damage they do cause is quickly repaired , because the birds ' droppings boost soil life . When it 's necessary to loosen soil at depth - as in a young garden whose soil has not yet mellowed sufficiently to grow good root crops - I recommend the broad fork , a hand tool that , like the scythe , makes joyful , all-round use of the body in a rhythm that becomes a garden meditation . Unlike a power tiller , the broad fork loosens the soil without inverting the natural soil layers or breaking down the " crumb " structure of the soil . The broad fork is much easier to use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tool of choice for converting a tough grass sod over compacted soil to new garden ground . Does that mean that in this case we are forced to revert to power-driven steel ? Not on my homestead , where once again chicken power comes to the rescue . Normally , I would rotate the birds onto another plot after a week or so to prevent excessive wearing of the pasture sod , but in this case " excessive wearing " is exactly what I want . I use electronet to " park " a flock of chickens on the sod I want to convert to garden . With their constant scratching , the birds kill and till in the sod . I remove the birds , grow a mixed cover crop , then return the chickens for another round of tilling . Now the new ground is ready to start working as garden . Be sure to note the state of the soil before you start-the changes by the end of the season will amaze you . If you do n't have chickens , a no-till way to develop new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously discussed , which is heavy enough to kill the existing sod . If you can be generous with watering through the germination phase , you can start a cover crop in the top layer of the compost , and the roots will greatly accelerate the breakdown of the mulch . Plant a second cover in the fall . This strategy works better if you can give the area over completely to soil building for a full year . If you have to get some production out of the ground the first season , simply open up holes in the compost and plant ( a strategy that works better with some crops than others ) . You can also try using potatoes to do the heavy work for you . Lay your seed potatoes directly on the sod , and cover with a thick mulch . Renew the mulch as needed to keep the growing tubers well covered . When it 's time to harvest , simply push the mulch aside and pick up your spuds . The new garden soil still has a long way to go , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do massive tillage in the garden is when digging root crops such as potatoes , sweet potatoes and burdock . With such crops , I dig deep and thoroughly with the spading fork-a total disruption of soil structure and inversion/mixing of its natural layers . My goal , however , is to make such intensive disruptions the rare exception rather than the rule . That way , the intact soil life communities in surrounding beds soon help rebuild the soil food web in the disturbed areas . Sidebar This garden needed room to grow ! The first step was to cover the ground with compost . Next , the garden was divided into permanent beds and paths to protect the soil from foot traffic . Sidebar Start a Compost Pile To build a compost pile , start by layering organic materials . Alternate more readily decomposable materials - fresh , high-nitrogen wastes , such as manures , crop residues , kitchen wastes and weeds - with less decomposable materials - drier , coarser and high-carbon wastes , such as autumn leaves , straw and corncobs . Microbes feed on all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds . The microbes need water and oxygen , so keep the pile moist , but not sopping wet . As they break down the organic matter , the microbes generate heat . Make the pile large enough to retain heat , but not so large that oxygen can not penetrate to the center , about 4 feet on each side is a good size . To encourage aeration , mix the coarser elements throughout the pile to ensure plenty of air space . When the pile cools , turn the heap-with the outer layers going to the inside and vice versa-to incorporate more oxygen and generate a new heating cycle . The compost pile may need to be turned more than once to complete the process . Sidebar Harvey and Ellen disturb their soil as little as possible . Digging root crops is almost the only time they dig up the ground . Sidebar Put chickens in your garden during the fall and winter , and they 'll eat bugs and weed seeds , till lightly and fertilize . Sidebar Cover crops are useful both for small patches in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This field is planted with buckwheat , which smothers weeds because it grows so quickly . As best you can , never leave your soil bare . Cover crops are low-maintance and add valuable nutrients to the soil . Clockwise from top left : Vetch , white clover , red clover , and oats planted together with field peas . Life in the Soil It 's often said that organic material in soil consists of " the living , the recently dead and the very dead . " This is a helpful way to understand the processes that shape soil and make it fertile . The living portion of soil is made up of plant roots , and of the numerous microbes and other living organisms that improve soil structure by breaking down organic material . The recently dead components include deceased soil organisms , green plant material and fresh manures . They decompose readily , and release nutrients quickly . The very dead portion is humus , the final residue of organic matter breakdown that 's important for soil structure and disease suppression . For fertile soil , all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sidebar Pick a Cover Crop There 's a cover crop for every season , climate and gardening strategy . Here are a few options to consider . * Fast-growing grain grasses ( rye , oats , wheat , barley ) are a good choice in early spring . * Cold-hardy legumes , such as peas , can be started in late winter and allowed to grow two months or longer to precede a warm-weather , heavy-feeding crop , such as winter squash . * Warm-weather legumes , such as soybeans or cowpeas , can fertilize beds that will be planted to fall crops that need rich soil , such as broccoli or fall-planted garlic and shallots. * For a quick-growing " filler " between spring and fall crops , nothing beats buckwheat , the " instant cover crop " ( 30 days from seed to flower. ) * For winter , a mix of hairy vetch and rye ( cereal rye , the sort of rye used to make bread , not perennial rye or annual grass rye ) is a top choice . * Another good winter cover is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " winter pea " ( Pisum arvense , a close relative of P. sativum , the common garden pea ) . Both plants are cold-hardy , but reliably winterkill if the ground freezes in your area . You can leave them in place as mulch , and make spring transplants right into it . * Try undersowing to grow a food crop and a cover crop together . For example , you can put Dutch white clover in a bed where you are planting tall craps with a small " footprint " such as trellised tomatoes or pole beans . The clover comes up fast , establishing a tight cover that suppresses weeds and retains soil moisture . Since it is low-growing , it does not interfere with managing or harvesting the taller crops above it . Sidebar Every gardener knows this story .
