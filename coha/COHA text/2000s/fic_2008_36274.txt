I felt a hand on my shoulder , shaking me awake . <p> " Now you can pass as a local . They 've all got one leg shorter than the other . Comes from being raised on the side of a mountain . " The woman sitting beside my hospital bed laughed at her own joke and then offered me a paper bag . <p> " Who the hell are you ? " I pushed the control to incline the bed to where I could see her eye to eye . I did n't need someone waking me up and rubbing my nose in my predicament . <p> She tossed the bag onto my chest . " Tikima Robertson . Marine Corps-retired . Never got over it so now I come to the V.A . hospital to harass the leathernecks who feel sorry for themselves . " She gave a salute . The dark metal hook at the end of her forearm brushed her arched eyebrow . " What I figure is if the Marines had had a few more good women , we 'd have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then let me be the first to encourage you to re-up . " I glanced down at the bag and saw a hardback copy of Elmore Leonard 's Up in Honey 's Room . I 'm a Leonard Fan and the gift cooled my anger a few degrees . <p> " I would have reenlisted , but when I type I tear up the computer keyboard . " She waved the prosthetic hook in front of me . " So the Corps did n't want me back in public disinformation . " <p> I snapped off the sheet and uncovered my maimed left leg . <p> She looked where the stump ended just below the knee . " Not so bad . But you ca n't use one of these back scratchers . You 'll snag the carpet every time you walk . " <p> I smiled . " You 're full of black humor , are n't you ? " <p> " That 's what a black woman 's for . Keep a black man from taking himself too seriously , even if he 's white like you , Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in mock surrender . " I give up . What do you want ? " <p> " Give up ? Well , if I did n't already know it , you just proved you 're Army . And a glorified MP , not even a real soldier . " <p> My temper flared . I lifted the book and shoved it toward her . " No thanks . I do n't want your gift or your insults . And we all turned into MPs over there . One god-damned police force trying to separate people who only hate us a little more than they hate each other . " <p> Tikima flinched and looked away . I held the book over the edge of the bed , waiting for her to take it . <p> She sighed and turned to me . " Sorry . That was uncalled for . Sometimes I try too hard to make a connection . " She stood . " But keep the book . Ai n't Mr. Leonard 's fault I got no tact . " <p> Her apology sounded straight from the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting off so easy . " I nodded to the chair . " No woman walks out on Sam Blackman . " <p> She hesitated a moment and then the twinkle returned to her eyes . " Is that an order ? " <p> " Yes , from a glorified MP . Do I have to handcuff you ? " <p> " It helps to have hands . " She scooted the chair nearer and sat . <p> I gave her a closer look . Tikima had dark smooth skin and a shapely figure that her khaki pants suit could n't hide . She wore her curly black hair cropped close to her head . Her ringless left hand rested in her lap as a cradle for the hook . I have difficulty estimating a woman 's age , but I guessed she was in her mid-thirties , a couple of years older than me . <p> She cleared her throat as if to start our conversation anew . " So , have you found a guy in here with only a left foot so you can go in on shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a request back in Amputee Alley at Walter Reed to be on the lookout for a prospect . " <p> " Came through there myself three years ago . They tried to give me one of those new fake arms they claim looks real . Black plastic supposed to match my skin . My skin 's no more black than yours is white . I looked like I 'd stolen the arm off Darth Vader . I said forget this , give me something that works . " <p> Tikima lifted her arm . The hook was actually a curved vise with one side longer than the other . " I shrug my shoulder and the clamp closes . " The tips met with an audible click . " Now I mail Amputee Alley all my right-handed gloves . " <p> I decided we 'd best get the war stories out of the way . If Tikima Robertson had been sent by some army shrink to have me open up , then we could check that off the to-do list . " How 'd you lose the hand ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Marine women were kept out of combat . " <p> " Oh , did I miss the memo about where the frontline was ? " She shook her head . " We were supposed to be in a secure area . I was riding with an AP reporter and we had the honor of driving by as one of the first car bombs detonated . The reporter was lucky . Only lost his laptop . You 'd think he 'd taken a round to the chest . I had to pull him screaming out of the vehicle . " She looked at my leg . " Roadside bomb ? " <p> " No . Rocket grenade at a checkpoint . Concussion knocked me out . Sunni insurgents in stolen Iraqi uniforms . Two of my buddies were killed . " <p> Tikima nodded . She did n't ask any questions about how I was coping with the loss of my comrades or how I felt about becoming the proverbial one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest . I thought maybe she was n't on shrink patrol after all . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " No . The only information the staff shared was that you 're from Winston-Salem , your enlistment is up , and you 're scheduled for release from rehab in a few weeks . " <p> " I 'm here because I talked to The Washington Post about the deplorable conditions at Walter Reed . And then I testified from a wheelchair on Capitol Hill . " <p> She scowled . " I 'm surprised you 're not in Guam . " <p> " Yeah , the administrators were all too anxious to have me disappear . Especially after I told them I was n't interested in going through rehab to stay in an army that treats its wounded like curbside trash . " <p> " I know , " Tikima said . " I tried to get something done when I was there . " She looked like she might cry at the memory . <p> " Well , some big asses got some big kicks . I 'd hoped they 'd send me to Salisbury about thirty minutes from where I grew up . The V.A . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Then Blackman got misspelled as Black Mtn and I wound up in Asheville because it 's next to Black Mountain . " <p> " Are you going back to Winston-Salem when you 're released ? " <p> " I do n't know . My family 's not there anymore . My parents were killed in a car wreck earlier this year and I have a brother in Birmingham who wants me to come there . " <p> " Girlfriend ? " <p> " I got the Dear John letter the second week I was in Walter Reed . " <p> She leaned forward . " Stay here awhile . I 'll help you find a place . " <p> " And do what ? Walk around the side of a mountain with the locals ? " <p> " I 'm a local . My family 's been here for over a hundred years . " <p> The door to the room opened and a nurse brought my roommate back from physical therapy . Old Mr. Carlisle was a World War Two vet in his eighties . His mind spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief conversations he 'd be storming the beach at Saipan one minute and walking with his late wife on Myrtle Beach the next . <p> Tikima got up and helped hold the wheelchair steady as the nurse assisted Mr. Carlisle back into bed . The nurse transferred his oxygen supply from his portable unit to the feed coming from the wall connector . <p> Then the nurse rolled the wheelchair to me . " Ready to work with your prosthesis ? " <p> " What 's the army giving him ? " Tikima asked . <p> " A trans-tibial with good rotation . He can be on the golf course in a few months . " <p> " As a caddy , " I said . " My disability benefit would n't buy a bag of golf tees . " <p> Tikima unsnapped her small purse and withdrew a business card . " Let 's stay in touch . I might be able to find you gainful employment . " <p> The embossed type read " Tikima Robertson-Consultant , Armitage Security Services . " <p> " Need a night watchman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brain . Unless you left that in Iraq along with your leg . " <p> The nurse blushed , but Tikima 's bluntness no longer bothered me . <p> " Then come see me . " I patted the bag with the book . " And bring another Leonard . I 'll be through this in two days . " <p> Tikima laughed and turned to the nurse . " Work his ass off . Next time I 'm here I want to see him tap dancing . " She shrugged her shoulder and the gripping mechanism on her hook sounded like a castanet . With a flourish of clicks , she twirled out the door . <p> * * * <p> Two weeks passed and Tikima Robertson did n't return . I walked as many hours on my artificial leg as the rehab team allowed . The more adept I became the more I wanted to improve . I spent most of my days exploring the hospital halls or reading in the library where many of the donated books seemed to have been untouched . I wondered how Tikima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard fan in particular . <p> Tikima had come on a Saturday morning , and on the third Monday after her visit , the doctor in charge of my case told me I 'd made all the recovery that was possible under their care . In other words , because of my hard work and commitment , I 'd progressed enough that Uncle Sam would be cutting me loose at the end of the week . Adios and have a nice life . <p> The army had been my home since high school . My only immediate prospect was to go to Birmingham and transition for a few weeks with my older brother , his wife , and their three-month-old twin girls . The possibility of being a night watchman seemed infinitely preferable . I decided to contact Tikima , even though I 'd hoped she would have made good on her promise to return . While Mr. Carlisle was in rehab , I phoned the number on Tikima 's card . <p> A computerized voice announced Armitage Security Services and prompted me to direct-dial an extension or wait for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three digit number under Tikima 's name . " This extension is no longer in service , " came the automated reply . " You are being transferred to the operator . " <p> " I 'm calling for Tikima Robertson , " I told the woman who answered . <p> I heard only silence and thought we 'd been disconnected . <p> " Hello ? My name is Sam Blackman . Tikima told me to call . " <p> " Hold one moment please , Mr. Blackman . " <p> After a few minutes of classical music , a strong baritone voice came on the line . " This is Nathan Armitage . How can I help you ? " <p> " I 'm trying to reach Tikima Robertson . She gave me her card and asked me to get in touch . " <p> " Can you tell me the nature of your request ? " <p> Just like a security firm to make you jump through hoops . " The nature of my request is to speak with Tikima . I 'm a wounded vet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit me . The name 's Sam Blackman . Do you need my social security number to do a background check ? " <p> I heard him take a deep breath . " Mr. Blackman , I 'm sorry to tell you Tikima has died . I thought maybe you were one of her clients . " <p> My mouth turned to dry cotton . I 'd only met the woman for a few minutes , but I 'd replayed the scene of her dancing out of my hospital room countless times . In Iraq , you understood soldiers went on patrol and did n't come back , but in Asheville , North Carolina ? <p> " How ? " I whispered . <p> His voice broke . " She was murdered , Mr. Blackman . " <p> The word murdered rang in my ear . I sat staring at the door , seeing Tikima laugh and dance through it . <p> When I did n't respond , Armitage continued , " She 'd been missing since June 2nd , that was a Saturday . " <p> " The day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Armitage asked . <p> " Around ten that morning . " <p> " The police may want to speak to you . Can I give them your name ? " <p> " Yes . " I wound the phone cord into a ball with my free hand . " What happened ? " <p> " We 're not sure . Believe me , Mr. Blackman , we 're pressing the police for action . Our company provides only protective security services for clients , we do n't do investigative work . But Tikima was a friend and colleague to all of us . I 've authorized a twenty-five thousand dollar reward for anyone providing information that can uncover her murderer . " <p> I 'd worked enough cases with the military 's Criminal Investigation Detachment to know the best leads come fast . If the police were n't even sure what happened , then the trail must be ice cold . <p> " You have to know something , " I said . <p> " Only that Tikima 's sister spoke with her that Saturday afternoon . Tikima planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never showed up . " <p> " What 'd she do Saturday night ? " <p> " Her sister said Tikima told her she was meeting somebody about work . " <p> " A client ? " <p> " None we know of . " <p> " Where was her body found ? " <p> Armitage hesitated . " Look , I do n't know you , Mr. Blackman . You could be who you say you are or you could be involved somehow . " <p> " Then just tell me what was in the paper . I 'm clueless . I 'm in a hospital bed and I ca n't stomach reading the god-damned news . " <p> " Some fishermen on the French Broad River found her body last Wednesday . She 'd been weighed down with stones , but the current and the- " Armitage 's voice wavered , " and the gases from the decomposition of her body brought her to the surface . " <p> " Do they have a cause of death ? " <p> " Has n't been officially released but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunshot to the head . " <p> What a cruel twist . Have your hand blown off in Iraq and then come home to be murdered . Tikima Robertson was someone who deserved better from life . " Have they held the memorial service ? " <p> " Tomorrow morning at eleven . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church . " <p> " I want the address . " <p> " Mr. Blackman , you said you 're in the hospital . " <p> " I am . But somehow I 'll get to the funeral tomorrow . " <p> Armitage was quiet for a moment , and then said , " Can you be out front at ten-fifteen ? I 'll pick you up in a black Lexus . " <p> " All right . And I 'll be the one tap dancing on my new leg . " I hung up and looked at the empty doorway . " Like I said , Tikima , no woman walks out on Sam Blackman . " <p> Chapter Two At eight the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a clear plastic oxygen tube dangling half out of his nostrils . Mr. Carlisle suffered from chronic respiratory problems-a condition created when a Japanese fuel tank exploded on Saipan and smothered him in black diesel smoke . He 'd also spent a lifetime with cigarettes which , despite the tobacco lobby 's claims to the contrary , continued the destruction of his lungs . He 'd checked into the hospital a week after I arrived . Odds were he would n't be checking out . <p> During the six weeks of physical therapy since my transfer from Walter Reed , I 'd seen Mr. Carlisle 's daughter take him out every Sunday for dinner . She made sure he had something suitable to wear . The wardrobe that had come with me from Walter Reed consisted of military fatigues and a red Hawaiian shirt . Not the most appropriate way to show respect for the dead . My brother had moved my things out of our parents ' home when the house had gone on the market , and he kept the few non-army clothes I owned waiting for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the crutches leaning against the wall . With the stealth of a commando , I checked Mr. Carlisle 's drawer for anything that might carry a decorum of dignity . He had several pairs of boxer shorts , black socks with elastic so frayed they fell down around his ankles , two pairs of navy blue slacks rolled up like miniature sleeping bags , and a folded white shirt . I shook the shirt and the wrinkles disappeared . The fabric contained so much polyester it would melt under a hot lamp . <p> Mr. Carlisle stood a good six inches shorter than me but he had at least an extra six inches around the waist . I tossed my hospital gown back on the bed and tried on his shirt . The length provided enough tail to tuck in , but the sleeves stopped halfway down my forearm . I turned back the cuffs . Casual but neat . I 'd have to go with my military pants . Thank God they were n't camo . At least I would n't appear to have stopped at the church on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed and fit my artificial limb into position . Such an odd feeling to look down and see this impostor replacing part of my body . I knew some men at Walter Reed who 'd given their prosthesis a name . I do n't think this cold device and I could ever be so intimate . <p> Mr. Carlisle coughed and shifted in bed . I kept my back to him . <p> " Where you going , Sam ? " he asked in a raspy voice . <p> " Thought I 'd practice walking outside before it gets too hot . " <p> " Do n't spill anything on my shirt . " He rolled back over . <p> I stopped at the nurses ' station and said I was going to the library . I carried the book Tikima had given me . I asked the duty nurse to cancel my morning physical therapy because I had a guest coming to talk about a job possibility . All the nurses knew I 'd been cleared for release on Friday and they 'd started cutting me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation before being dumped on the world . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
