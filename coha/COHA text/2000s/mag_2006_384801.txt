With Oil Revenue , Venezuela is Pushing Organic Agriculture // In the heart of the fast-paced city of Caracas , Venezuela , Norali Verenzuela is standing in a garden dressed in jeans and work boots . She is the director of the state-initiated Organoponico Bolivar I , the first urban , organic garden to show its green face in the city . Presently , according to the United Nations , Venezuela imports about 80 percent of the food that it consumes . To Verenzuela , the garden represents a positive step . " People are waking up , " she says . " We 've been dependent on McDonalds and Wendy s for so long . Now people are learning to eat what we can produce ourselves . " Verenzuelas 1.2-acre plot is part of a plan led by the government of President Hugo Chavez to create " endogenous , " or self sufficient , development . " We have been exporters of raw materials and consumers of manufactured goods . One of the first objectives ... is to put a stop to that game , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry set a target of supplying 20 percent of Venezuela 's vegetables through urban gardens . The program also holds workshops to show people how to create their own organoponicos for domestic consumption . At this stage , however , the Organoponico Bolivar I is more of a showcase for the program than a true paradigm shift . " As a pilot project , " Verenzuela admits , the garden " ca n't be allowed to fail . " Chavez 's populist message has made him a hero for many Venezuelans and international leftists . In a nation that is one of the world 's largest exporters of oil , BBC reports that 83 percent of the population lives below the poverty line . Since Chavez took office in 1998 , he has funded many social welfare projects by redirecting state oil income . Venezuelan oil has also made Chavez many allies , including Cuba , which has exported its advisors for Chavez ' social projects . Still , " It 's not a Cuban model , " insisted Cojedes Covernor Jhonny Yanez to the Sf . Petersburg Times . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can feed itself . " The question is : for how long , and at what cost to the environment ? Chavez 's energy policies have also brought him just criticism from environmentalists . Though his administration has banned genetically modified seeds and created an indigenous seed bank , Center on Global Prosperity director Alvaro Vargas Llosa argues that anticapitalist environmentalists should oppose Chavez because his " government owns scores of refineries and cashes in big time on the processing of sulfurheavy crude . " Chavez 's oil contracts with Brazil 's Petrobras and Chevron Texaco caused environmental journalist Hanna Dahlstrom to warn that " Chavez " big oil projects could .. . destroy the Amazon . " The gardens that inspired the Organoponico Bolivar I were not initiated by a government , but by desperate Cubans . The collapse of the USSR in 1989 cut off over half of Cuba 's food supply , as well as the fertilizers , pesticides and fuel needed for industrial farming . Cuban families began growing vegetables domestically , without chemical products , and the idea caught on . Most of ( Aiba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . Though Cuban farmers claim that they will never shift their methods back to industrial monoculture , it remains to he seen it such techniques will continue past the reign of aging leader Fidel Castro .

Verenzuela says that the urban gardens have been a hard sell . Ninety two percent of Venezuelans live and work in urban centers , and many Caracans scoffed at Chavezs suggestion that barrio residents " raise crops and chickens on their balconies . " Vereimiela stressed the fresh and healthy benefits of organic produce , but nearby street vendors say they like the produce because it is cheaper than the grocery store . Outreach programs are trying to change attitudes . The garden provides tours , and agricultural students at the new Bolivarian University are required to intern there . Drop-in workers from nearby barrios , such as Caricuao , can also work there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garden is possible in a city , " Verenzuela says . The garden has n't been immune to the deep social divide over Chavez ' presidency , either . In its first few months , says Verenzuela , the opposition to Chavez stole plants and protested outside . Opposition-owned media reported that the vegetables were unsafe to eat . In November , workers even found clandestinely introduced goats in the garden . Before the goats were able to do much damage , workers caught , killed , barbequed and ate them for lunch . Outside of the cities , many are wondering when rural agriculture will get attention . Because of the success of the oil industry , Venezuela 's agricultural sector has been long neglected and is " the least productive in all of Latin America , " writes journalist Jon Lamb in Australia 's Green Left Weekly . There is no lack of arable land , but production is only six percent of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) . The national farmers ' federation , FEDEAGRO , says it is not opposed to the urban program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural farming . " The government is concentrating all efforts on city farming , and yet the national sector remains as it is , " says technical adviser Nelson Calabria . Another concern skeptics have about urban gardens is pollution . Experts claim that the exhaust-laden air could contaminate plants with carbon monoxide and lead . At the Bolivar I , a technician comes every 15 days to take a reading from the small pollution meter in the middle of the garden . Verenzuela was not able to say what the acceptable levels were , but indicated no cause for alarm had yet been found . Now , according to Verenzuela , the garden has become an accepted part of the cityscape . In tact , some of its most faithful customers are opposed to Chavez . " We are making food , and food is not political , " she says . " Besides , they know our food is better . " Still , as environmentalists know , food is a highly political issue in the modern world , and it remains to be seen how and if Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lose Chavez and oil revenue . <p>
