Chapter One THE ONLY THINGS MOVING IN THE VASTNESS OF THE LLLUNG VALLEY were two black specks , barely larger than the frost-split boulders that covered the valley floor , inching along a faint track . The valley was a desolate place , devoid of trees ; the wind chuckled and whispered among the rocks , the cries of black eagles echoed from the cliffs . The figures , on horseback , were approaching an immense wall of granite , two thousand feet high , from which poured a slow plume of water- the source of the sacred Tsangpo River . The trail disappeared into the mouth of a gorge that split the rock face , reappeared at higher altitude as a cut angled into the sheer wall of rock , and finally topped out on a long ridge before disappearing once again into the jagged peaks and fissures beyond . Framing the scene , and forming a backdrop of stupendous power and majesty , stood the frozen immensity of three Himalayan mountains-Dhaulagiri , Annapurna , and Manaslu-trailing plumes of snow . Beyond them , a sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two figures rode up the valley , cowled against the chill wind . This was the last stage of a long journey , and despite the rising storm they rode at a slow pace , their horses on the vergeof exhaustion . As they approached the mouth of the gorge , they crossed a rushing stream once , and then a second time . Slowly , the two entered the gorge and vanished . Inside the gorge , they continued following the faint trail as it climbed above the roaring stream . Hollows of blue ice lay in the shadows where the rock wall met the boulder-strewn floor . Dark clouds scudded across the sky , pushed before a rising wind that moaned in the upper reaches of the gorge . The trail changed abruptly at the base of the great rock wall , mounting upward through a steep and terrifying cut . An ancient guard station , built on a projecting tongue of rock , lay in ruins : four broken stone walls supporting nothing more than a row of blackbirds . At the very foot of the cut stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rubbed and polished by thousands of hands of those wishing a blessing before attempting the dangerous journey to the top . At the guard station , the two travelers dismounted . From here they were forced to proceed on foot , leading their horses up the narrow trail as the overhang was too low to admit a rider . In places , landslides had peeled away the sheer rock wall , taking the trail with it ; these gaps had been bridged by rough planks and poles drilled into the rock , forming a series of narrow , creaking bridges without railings . Elsewhere , the trail was so steep that the travelers and their mounts were forced to climb steps carved into the rock , made slick and uneven by the passage of countless pilgrims and animals . The wind shifted now , driving through the gorge with a booming sound , carrying flakes of snow with it . The stormshadow fell into the gorge , plunging it into a gloom as deep as night . Still the two figures pushed up the vertiginous trail , up the icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar of the waterfall echoed strangely between the walls of stone , mingling with the rising wind like mysterious voices speaking in an unknown tongue . When the travelers at last topped the ridge , the wind almost halted them in their tracks , whipping their robes and biting at their exposed skin . They hunched against it and , pulling their reluctant horses forward , continued along the spine of the ridge until they reached the remains of a ruined village . It was a bleak place , the houses thrown down by some ancient cataclysm , their timbers scattered and broken , the mud bricks dissolving back into the earth from which they had been formed . In the center of the village , a pile of prayer stones rose , topped by a pole from which snapped dozens of tattered prayer flags . To one side lay an ancient cemetery whose retaining wall had collapsed , and now erosion had opened the graves , scattering bones and skulls down a long scree slope . As the two approached , a group of ravens flapped up in noisy protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaden clouds . At the pile of stones , one of the travelers stopped and dismounted , gesturing for the other to wait . He bent down , picked up an old stone , and added it to the pile . Then he paused briefly in silent meditation , the wind lashing at his robes , before retaking the reins of his horse . They continued on . Beyond the deserted village the trail narrowed sharply along a knife-edge ridge . Struggling against the violence of the wind , the two figures crept along it , arcing around the shoulder of a mountain-and then at last they could just begin to spy the battlements and pinnacles of a vast fortress , standing dully against the dark sky . This was the monastery known as Gsalrig Chongg , a name that might be translated as " the Jewel of the Awareness of Emptiness . " As the trail continued around the side of the mountain , the monastery came fully into view : massive red-washed walls and buttresses mounting the sides of a barren granite rock , ending in a complex of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of gold leaf . The Gsalrig Chongg monastery was one of very few in Tibet to have escaped the ravages of the Chinese invasion , in which soldiers drove out the Dalai Lama , killed thousands of monks , and destroyed countless monasteries and religious structures . Gsalrig Chongg was spared partly because of its extreme remoteness and its proximity to the disputed border with Nepal , but also due to a simple bureaucratic oversight : its very existence had somehow escaped official attention . Even today , maps of the so-called Tibet Autonomous Region do not locate this monastery , and the monks have taken great pains to keep it that way . The trail passed by a steep scree slope , where a group of vultures picked away at some scattered bones . " There appears to have been a recent death , " the man murmured , nodding toward the heavy birds , which hopped about , utterly fearless . " How so ? " asked the second traveler . " When a monk dies , his body is butchered and thrown to the wild animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal remains nourish and sustain other living things . " " A peculiar custom . " " On the contrary , the logic is impeccable . Our customs are peculiar . " The trail ended at a small gate in the massive encircling wall . The gate was open and a Buddhist monk stood there , wrapped in robes of scarlet and saffron , holding a burning torch , as if expecting them . The two huddled travelers passed through the gate , still leading their horses . A second monk appeared and silently took the reins , leading the animals off to stables within the encircling wall . The travelers stopped before the first monk , in the gathering darkness . He said nothing , but merely waited . The first traveler pulled back his cowl-revealing the long , pale face , white-blond hair , marble features , and silvery eyes of Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . The monk turned toward the other . The second figure removed its cowl with a tentative movement , brown hair spilling out into the wind , catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a young woman who appeared to be in her early twenties , with a delicate face , finely formed lips , and high cheekbones-Constance Greene , Pendergast 's ward . Her penetrating violet eyes darted around , taking in everything quickly , before dropping again to the ground . The monk stared at her for only a moment . Making no comment , he turned and gestured for them to follow him down a stone causeway toward the main complex . Pendergast and his ward followed the monk in silence as he passed through a second gate and entered the dark confines of the monastery itself , the air laden with the scent of sandalwood and wax . The great ironbound doors boomed shut behind them , muffling the howling wind to a faint whisper . They continued down a long hallway , one side of which was lined with brass prayer cylinders , creaking and turning round and round , driven by some hidden mechanism . The hall forked , and turned again , driving deeper into the monastic depths . Another monk appeared in front of them carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of ancient frescoes lining both walls . The mazelike turnings brought them at last into a large room . One end was dominated by a gold statue of Padmasambhava , the Tantric Buddha , illuminated by hundreds of candles . Unlike the contemplative , half-closed eyes of most depictions of the Buddha , the Tantric Buddha 's eyes were wide open , alert and dancing with life , symbolizing the heightened awareness achieved by his study of the secret teachings of Dzogchen and the even more esoteric Chongg Ran . The Gsalrig Chongg monastery was one of two repositories in the world preserving the discipline of Chongg Ran , the enigmatic teachings known to those few who were familiar with them as the Jewel of the Mind 's Impermanence . At the threshold to this inner sanctum , the two travelers paused . At the far end , a number of monks reposed in silence , sitting on tiered stone benches as if awaiting someone . The uppermost tier was occupied by the abbot of the monastery . He was a peculiar-looking man , his ancient face wrinkled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robes hung from his skeletal frame like laundry draped on a rack . Next to him sat a slightly younger monk , also known to Pendergast : Tsering , one of only very few of the monks who spoke English , who acted as the " manager " of the monastery . He was an exceptionally well-preserved man of perhaps sixty . Below them sat a row of twenty monks of all ages , some teenagers , others ancient and wizened . Tsering rose and spoke in an English shot through with the strange , musical lilt of Tibetan . " Friend Pendergast , we welcome you back to monastery of Gsalrig Chongg , and we welcome your guest . Please sit down and take tea with us . " He gestured to a stone bench set with two silk " embroidered cushions " the only cushions in the room . The two sat , and moments later several monks appeared carrying brass trays loaded with cups of steaming buttered tea and tsampa . They drank the sweet tea in silence , and only when they had finished did Tsering speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chongg ? " he asked . Pendergast rose . " Thank you , Tsering , for your welcome , " he said quietly . " I 'm glad to be back . I return to you in order to continue my journey of meditation and enlightenment . Let me introduce to you Miss Constance Greene , who also has come in hopes of study . " He took her hand and she rose . A long silence ensued . At last , Tsering rose . He walked over to Constance and stood before her , looking calmly into her face , and then reached up and touched her hair , fingering it delicately . Then , ever so gently , he reached out and touched the swell of her breasts , first one , then the other . She remained standing , unflinching . " Are you a woman ? " he asked . " Surely you 've seen a woman before , " said Constance dryly . " No , " said Tsering . " I have not seen woman since I come here " at age of two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I am a woman . " Tsering turned to Pendergast . " This is first woman ever to come to Gsalrig Chongg . We never accept woman before as student . I am sorry to say it can not be permitted . Especially now , in middle of funeral ceremonies for Venerable Ralang Rinpoche . " " The Rinpoche is dead ? " Pendergast asked . Tsering bowed . " I am sorry to hear of the death of the Most High Lama . " At this , Tsering smiled . " Is no loss . We will find his reincarnation " the nineteenth Rinpoche-and he will be with us again . It is I who am sorry to deny your request . " " She needs your help . I need your help . We are both ... tired of the world . We have come a long way to find peace . Peace , and healing . " " I know how difficult journey you make . I know how much you hope . But Gsalrig Chongg exist for thousand year without female presence , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long silence ensued . And then Pendergast raised his eyes to the ancient , unmoving figure occupying the highest seat . " Is this also the decision of the abbot ? " At first , there was no sign of movement . A visitor might have even mistaken the wizened figure for some kind of happy , senile idiot , grinning vacantly from his perch above the others . But then there was the merest flick of a desiccated finger , and one of the younger monks climbed up and bent over the abbot , placing his ear close to the man 's toothless mouth . After a moment he straightened up and said something to Tsering in Tibetan . Tsering translated . " The abbot asks woman to repeat name , please . " " I am Constance Greene , " came the small but determined voice . Tsering translated into Tibetan , having some difficulty over the name . Another silence ensued , stretching into minutes . Again the flick of the finger ; again the ancient monk mumbled into the ear of the young monk , who repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The abbot asks if this real name . " She nodded . " Yes , it is my real name . " Slowly the ancient lama raised a sticklike arm and pointed to a dim wall of the room with a fingernail that extended at least an inch from his finger . All eyes turned toward a temple painting hidden under a draped cloth , one of many hanging on the wall . Tsering walked over and lifted the cloth , holding up a candle to it . The glow revealed a stunningly rich and complex image : a bright green female deity with eight arms , sitting on a white moon disk , with gods , demons , clouds , mountains , and gold filigree swirling about her , as if caught in a storm . The old lama mumbled at length into the ear of the young monk , his toothless mouth working . Then he sat back and smiled while Tsering again translated . " His Holiness ask to direct attention to thangka painting of Green Tara . " There was a murmuring and shuffling of the monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle around the painting , like students waiting for a lecture . The old lama flapped a bony arm at Constance Greene to join the circle , which she hastily did , the monks shuffling aside to afford her space . " This is picture of Green Tara , " Tsering continued , still translating at one remove the mumbled words of the old monk . " She is mother of all Buddhas . She have constancy . Also wisdom , activity of mind , quick thinking , generosity , and fearlessness . His Holiness invite female to step closer and view mandala of Green Tara . " Constance stepped forward tentatively . " His Holiness ask why student given name of Green Tara . " Constance looked around . " I do n't know what you mean . " " Your name Constance Greene . This name contain two important attribute of Green Tara . His Holiness ask how you get name . " " Greene is my last name . It 's a common English surname , but I 've no idea of the origin . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother . It was popular in ... around the time I was born . Any resemblance of my name to the Green Tara is obviously a coincidence . " Now the abbot began to laugh , shakily , and struggled to stand with the help of two monks . In a few moments he was standing , but just barely , as if the slightest nudge would jostle him into a loose heap . He continued to laugh as he spoke again , a low , wheezy sound , displaying his pink gums , his bones almost rattling with mirth . " Coincidence ? No such thing . Student make funny joke , " Tsering translated . " The abbot like good joke . " Constance glanced at Tsering to the abbot and back again . " Does that mean I 'll be allowed to study here ? " " It mean your study is already begun , " said Tsering , with a smile of his own . (
