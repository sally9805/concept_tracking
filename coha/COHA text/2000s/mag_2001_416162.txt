Charles Spencer talks about his spirited sister , the vow he made to her sons-and Headnote what she would have been like at 40 Photograph " The more time that passes , the less raw the wound , " says Spencer ( in the King William room at Althorp , where Diana slept ) . " But it is always going to be there . " Photograph Photograph " She was always my sister , " says Spencer ( with Diana in 1981 ) . " She was never the princess . " // Sitting aboard a red-eye flight from Cape Town to London on Sept. 1 , 1997 , Charles Spencer was caught between numbed disbelief and stomach  --  churning sadness . Forty-eight hours earlier , his sister Diana , Princess of Wales , had been killed in a horrific car crash in Paris . " I would flit between thinking this was not really happening , " he recalls , " to thinking I had to deal with it . " To distract himself , Spencer spent the flight contemplating the practicalities of burying his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eulogy , " says Spencer . " I went through my address book twice and realized it was going to have to be me . It was an awful feeling-a chill went through me . " Four days later the ninth Earl Spencer took the pulpit at London 's Westminster Abbey to deliver a eulogy that was part soaring tribute , part searing battle cry . Before an estimated worldwide audience of more than 1 billion people , Spencer lauded the sister he called " complex " and " radiant . " Locking eyes with his nephews , Princes William and Harry , he vowed that " we , your blood family , will do all we can to continue the imaginative and loving way " in which Diana had been rearing them . " I was not trying to make a big impact , " he insists . " I was just trying to do justice to my sister . " Intentional or not , his impact could be felt far beyond the historic church 's stone walls . Instantly , Spencer had gone from being Diana 's kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent when the Queen stripped Diana of the title Her Royal Highness after her 1996 divorce from Prince Charles , silent when the royal family all but froze her out in the years prior to her death . Clearly , he would be silent no longer . The speech " was very much the knightly crusade on Diana 's behalf , " says royals author Robert Lacey . It is a crusade that Spencer has continued , and one that has cemented his place in the hearts of his sister 's admirers . " I often have to fight with taxi drivers to get them to accept my fare , " says the usually tight-lipped earl , talking candidly about his lost sister and the trying four years since her death . " They were particularly fond of Diana . " Photograph Spencer says he chose his sister 's island burial site because Diana ( in the ' ' 60s ) " loved water . She was a fantastic swimmer . " " They are doing very well , " Spencer says of his now grown nephews , Princes William and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This exclusive photo was kept in one of Diana 's personal albums , with the words " Charles joins me all day at Silfield School , May 1969. " // For those who share that fondness , there is Althorp . Once again this summer , Spencer , 37 , will unlock the doors to his family 's ancestral estate and his sister 's final resting place as well as the home of the $4.1 million museum Diana , a Celebration . This year 's opening holds particular resonance , since it will take place on July 1 , the day that Diana would have turned 40 . The birthday is one the princess would have regarded apprehensively , suspects her brother . " I imagine she would not have been looking forward to being 40 . She was always conscious of her age and appearance , " he says . " But I ca n't see her losing that happiness and strength she had achieved . " After her painful marriage , he observes , " she had reached the rebirth stage and was ready to move on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims , all in search of a connection to the icon they knew-and the mother , sister and wife they did n't . For Spencer , the continued outpouring of grief from strangers remains disconcerting . " I find it difficult when people break down in tears , " he says . " I resort to a very British defense mechanism and block it out . " That mechanism offered little protection immediately upon his learning that Diana had been killed when the car in which she was riding had crashed in a Paris tunnel . Then living in South Africa with his four children-Kitty , now 10 , twins Eliza and Katya Amelia , 8 , and Louis , 7-Spencer was awakened just after midnight by a phone call from the estate manager at Althorp . The next morning , he faced his children in tears . " I said , " I have got some appalling news . I am afraid Aunt Diana has died , " ' he recalls . " They had not seen their father crying before and they stood around looking incredibly sad for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point after breakfast , I heard a scraping noise . Kitty , who was 6 , was dragging a chair across the kitchen floor to stand at the sink in order to try to do the washing up , " he says . " Little gestures like that were so thoughtful and charming . " Larger public gestures , such as the floral sea that washed up at the gates of Kensington Palace in the days after Diana 's death , were both strange and reassuring . " The night before the funeral I went with my family to Kensington Gardens and wandered around for half an hour , " he recalls . " We kept a low profile . It was comforting to see how much people were stunned by her death . " Spencer had risen at 4:30 a.m. one morning earlier that week to write his eulogy . " It took me an hour and a half , " he says . " It just tumbled out . " On the eve of the funeral , he visited his sister 's closed coffin in the chapel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of seeing the body of his father after he died of a heart attack in 1992 " was useful to realize it really is final , " he chose not to view Diana 's . " She had been so badly injured , " he says , " and I wanted to remember her as she was . " Photograph Though " happy and relaxed " on her wedding day , Diana " was desperate to get the tiara off because it was giving her a headache , " recalls Spencer Photograph The earl ( with ex-wife Victoria , twins Eliza and Katya and daughter Kitty at Althorp in 1993 ) says his kids " ask about what Diana was like as a child and which one of them is most like her . " Photograph Spencer stepped out with girlfriend Caroline Freud in London in January . // Alone in the chapel , he delivered his eulogy to Diana . When the sun rose next morning , Spencer could hardly have known what he was in for . The chiming of church bells , the cries of supporters along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it still stings . Walking behind Diana 's coffin-alongside William and Harry , their father , Prince Charles , and their grandfather Prince Philip- " was the most harrowing experience of my life , " he recalls . " There was a clear feeling of high emotion around you of the most sad and confused sort , all hammering in on you . It was a tunnel of grief . " At the time , Spencer says he opposed the Palace 's idea that William , then 15 , and Harry , almost 13 , participate in the somber march . " I genuinely felt that Diana would not have wanted them to have done it , " he says . Nonetheless , " I got a message a couple of days before the funeral saying yes , they did want to do it and they would like me there . " In the end , William and Harry " did beautifully , " says Spencer . After his speech at the Abbey , the public gave its own approval to Spencer himself , thereby burnishing his previously tarnished image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the British press for his partying ways , Spencer 's reputation was largely rehabilitated following his display of brotherly valor . Ironically , the speech was a reversal of the roles Diana and her brother had long filled : she the protector , he the protectee . After the 1967 split of their parents , Johnnie , the eighth Earl Spencer , and Frances Shand Kydd ( 65 and living a quiet life in Scotland ) , the two young siblings grew particularly close . " I always looked after my brother really , " Diana told biographer Andrew Morton . Their two older sisters-Lady Sarah McCorquodale , now 46 , and Lady Jane Fellowes , 44- " were at boarding school when Diana and I were young , " recalls Spencer , " so we spent more time together . " Describing himself as " quite shy " as a boy , he adds , " it was very important for me to have a big sister with me at school . " Like all sibling relationships , the one shared by Diana and Charles had its ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze you out for a bit , " says Spencer . " But as soon as she was ready to resume normal relations , I was ready . " Once Diana became ensconced in royal life , " I was entirely understanding of the fact that she was not used to hearing the word no , ' ' " he says . Yet he believes she appreciated his candor . " She was always just Diana to me-she never became the superstar princess . We were the only people , probably , " he says , including his parents and sisters , " who treated her as a normal human being . " Although Diana 's peripatetic schedule rendered brother-sister visits infrequent , she did carve out time for a stay at Spencer 's Cape Town home in March 1997 , about five months before her death . ( He had moved there in 1996 to distance his family from the British press . ) " It was really nice to spend a few days with no intrusion , " he recalls of the paparazzi-free visit . " She was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , was then undergoing a particularly messy breakup . Married in 1989 to former British model Victoria Lockwood , 35 , after a whirlwind courtship , he had seen their tempestuous romance become frequent tabloid fodder . During the course of their open  --  court divorce later that year , Lockwood 's lawyers painted the earl as a " serial adulterer . " Spencer , in turn , claimed that the marriage dissolved as a result of his wife 's " mental and physical health , " a reference to her struggles with anorexia and alcoholism . Ultimately , the pair agreed to a settlement in which Lockwood received $2.5 million , a sliver of his estimated $131 million fortune . These days , Spencer says , he and Lockwood are " perfectly civil to each other . " Their four children live with their mother in Cape Town and spend their school breaks with their father at Althorp . " They love it here , " says Spencer of the 500-year-old home , about 75 miles from London , which the earl inherited upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana . " They did go through a phase when someone would blurt out her name and one of them would say , Sssh , you will upset Daddy , " ' he recalls . " But I would say , No , we must talk about it . " ' With its 121 rooms ( Spencer principally occupies five ) , Althorp remains a monument to the British aristocracy . Diana was 13 years old , her brother 10 when they moved to the 10,000-acre estate in 1975 . Today , in addition to magnificent oil paintings and stately marble mantelpieces , the house holds the mundane evidence of daily life . In the living room , Spencer 's daughters ' dollhouse is tucked under a desk and a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire quiz book rests on a side table . Reminders of the past continue to pop up , such as the earl 's recent discovery of a schoolbook inscribed , in wobbly writing , " Diana Spencer . " " This house is so huge , I suppose that will go on forever , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way of coping was to keep an eye on the ground , " says Spencer ( with Princes Philip , William , Harry and Charles ) . Photograph The " strange atmosphere " at Kensington Palace after Diana 's death " was very eerie and deeply emotional , " says Spencer . " it was very unusual for Britain . " // A short walk from the house , situated on Althorp 's Round Oval island , lies Diana 's unmarked grave . Spencer marvels at the remarkable quiet that visitors , who are not permitted on the island , observe around the lake . " It has this cathedral-like atmosphere , and people whisper , " he says . " I am well aware that people are not just thinking about Diana but about their own tragedies and losses . It is very therapeutic . " Such was the case when Trevor ReesJones , Diana 's bodyguard and the sole survivor of the Paris car crash , visited the grave last summer . " We had a long chat and I left him by the lake , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " decent man . " Criticism of the Diana museum-once derided as " Dianaland " in the press-has faded of late . " I am not here to idealize her or pump out propaganda on her behalf , " says Spencer . " My family and I took the view that after she died , a lot of people would come to Althorp anyway , and that we should do something to satisfy the visitors ' curiosity and to protect Diana 's name and memory . " To charges that he is beatifying his sister , he counters , " No one is pretending she was not human , but at the end of the day she did some pretty amazing things in her short life . " Spencer , who pays $700,000 in annual upkeep for Althorp , does not profit from the $15-per-person admission fee ; the money goes instead to the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fund , to which Spencer has donated $1.2 million . Visitors ( most of whom hail from Great Britain ) can see home movies of the princess , the leather-bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk taffeta gown she wore for her wedding , nearly 20 years ago in 1981 , to Prince Charles . The dress evokes Spencer 's memory of seeing Diana as a bride . " That was the first time I realized I had a beautiful sister , " he recalls . He dismisses accounts that she was having second thoughts on her wedding day . " The one thing about Diana is that you could see everything in her face , " he says . " She was not very good at faking-and she was genuinely happy that day . " As for the memorial fund , which Spencer had criticized in the past for inappropriate licensing , he says he is now " totally satisfied " with the way it is being run . " In the beginning it was an organization that effectively had $140 million dumped at its doorstep , so it was chaotic , " says former board member Vivienne Parry , a writer and broadcaster . " Now it has settled down and is giving away money in an effective way . And Earl Spencer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is headed by Spencer 's sister Sarah has taken in a total of $150 million in donations , $63 million of which has been pledged to 250 different charities worldwide . Among them : numerous children 's hospices and land-mine victims ' groups-causes that Diana had championed . Photograph The museum at Althorp " is an honest appraisal of her life , " says Spencer . Among the artifacts : some of the 14,000 condolence books sent from around the world . " It shows Diana 's impact , " he says . // Just as Spencer 's view of the fund has mellowed , so has his demeanor , revealing a marked difference from the fiery attitude he displayed at Diana 's funeral . His once rocky love life has assumed a quiet course since early 1999 , when he began dating former elementary-school teacher Caroline Freud , a divorced mother of two . A onetime TV news journalist-he worked as a correspondent for the Today show from 1986 to 1991-the Oxford-educated Spencer has devoted much of his energy to writing two well-received books , one on Althorp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book reviews and articles for several British magazines . " I like the variety in my life , " he says . While his relationship with Prince Charles and the rest of the senior royals remains distant , Spencer sees his nephews , William , who turns 19 on June 21 , and Harry , 16 , several times a year . Like them , he attended Eton College , where he recently accompanied Harry to a school sporting match . An enthusiastic tennis and cricket player , he shares the young princes ' athleticism , along with several of their physical traits-namely , William 's stature ( at 6 ' ' 4 " , Spencer is some two inches taller than Will ) and Harry 's sandy-red hair . In recent years , " the press have been pretty good about the boys on the whole and have given them space to develop , " allows Spencer , who acknowledges that his vow to the princes seems less urgent now than it did then . " They ) both know that they can ask me or anyone else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " Having said that , it was a vow made to two boys , and they are two young men now . " Though in large part Spencer , too , has moved on , he admits there are times when his grief will catch him off-guard . " Diana had a wonderful sense of humor , " he says , " and there are times when I think , " I must call up Diana and tell her that . ' And then I get that sinking feeling when I realize that is not possible . " As is the case with anyone whose life is extinguished so prematurely , the what-ifs of Diana 's stolen future continue to linger . Would she have married boyfriend Dodi Fayed , also killed in the crash ? Spencer doubts it , as she had never mentioned such a scenario to him . In general , he is loath to speculate beyond the obvious : Had Diana lived , she would still be promoting her causes and , most important , savoring the successes of her grown boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , " he says . He is also certain that , at 40 , Diana would have continued her reign as the globe 's most famous , followed , fascinating woman . " The sheer pleasure of seeing her face lighting up the front of a magazine made the world a more interesting place , " says her brother . " Certainly it has been a lot grayer without her .
