The name Kraft conjures images of cream-cheese blocks and gooey macaroni . TIME 's KRISTIN KLOBERDANZ sat down with CEO Roger Deromedi to discuss diet fads and what food companies should do about America 's obesity problem . <P> TIME : Some food-industry organizations are challenging the idea that obesity is an issue . Do you agree ? <P> ROGER DEROMEDI : We 're convinced that health and wellness are very important issues for our consumers . Sadly , two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese . It 's incumbent on all of us in the food industry to keep working on education and providing solutions . I look at the data and sense a broader awareness of nutrition . I just wish the numbers would show that people are improving their diets . <P> TIME : What is Kraft doing to help ? <P> R.D. : We have a new program called Sensible Solution , where products that meet strict dietary guidelines will get a flag . Our goal over time is to have more of our products have that Sensible Solution flag . <P> TIME : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy snack food . <P> R.D. : What you 'll find us doing is not necessarily eliminating those products but continually improving them by changing their composition , like adding whole grains . We also have a major program to reduce trans-fatty acids across our entire product line . <P> TIME : Philip Morris USA , a division of your largest shareholder , Altria , has supported the organization that is downplaying the risks of obesity . <P> R.D. : Kraft does not provide financial support to the group . On food issues , we think the right approach for Kraft is to do what we can to proactively address consumers ' concerns . <P> TIME : How much of a challenge has the low-carb craze been for Kraft ? <P> R.D. : Americans are always trying different diets to try to solve their nutrition needs . We have gone through periods when it was avoid sugar , avoid fat , avoid carbs . With a portfolio as large as ours , avoiding carbs had some pluses . It helped our cheese business ; it helped our bacon and meat business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crackers . <P> TIME : You 're rolling out a line of South Beach Diet products this spring . <P> R.D. : What appealed to us is that it 's not a low-carb diet , although many associate it with low carb . It 's a balanced diet of the right carbs , the right fats and lean sources of protein . I started in December and lost 12 lbs . in two months . <P> TIME : In the U.S. , you 've changed some of your ads toward children between the ages of 6 and 11 to emphasize nutrition . <P> R.D. : What we 're doing is shifting the mix of the products we advertise to children 6 to 11 to those that meet our Sensible Solution criteria . So we 're not just doing nutritional messages . We think that 's the way to do it  --  to encourage children to make the right choices . <P> TIME : What does your family eat ? <P> R.D. : We have teenage children , and they all have various tastes . But we have been enjoying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wraps . They drink the Crystal Light Sunrise . They 're a great test market . <P> TIME : Do you have a guilty-pleasure splurge food ? <P> R.D. : Cte d'Or chocolate . Food should be a pleasure . One of our goals is to combine the joy of food with good nutrition . There 's room for all foods in a diet .
