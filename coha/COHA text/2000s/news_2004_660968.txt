<p> " Hula , " the Hawaiian word most known throughout the world , immediately brings to mind the image of grass skirts , coconuts , and swinging hips . But when I was visiting the islands , a Hawaiian friend suggested if I truly wanted to get past the glitz of the tourist-focused presentation to the heart and soulof the dance , I should visit Molokai , birthplace of the hula . <p> Her cousin was hosting a luau on Molokai , the most rural of the Hawaiian islands , to honor her son 's first birthday . Relatives would dance in celebration , roast a pig in an open pit , and rejoice all day . Part of the commemoration would be a traditional hula . <p> The hula has had a turbulent history . When missionaries arrived in Hawaii in 1820 to preach and teach , they did their best to stamp out the dance , which they perceived as lewd and objectionable . <p> In 1830 , Queen Kaahumanu converted to Christianity and forbade public hula performances . By 1896 , when the Hawaiian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . <p> During the time when it was out of favor , knowledgeable elders far from the mission stations still taught the hula and its oral tradition . The dancers entertained in local homes . In this way , both the dance and the language were kept alive . <p> Different styles and types of hula evolved from the history of the people dancing . <p> Before hula studios and cellophane skirts came into existence , a dancer was chosen because the proper authorities deemed her suitable and worthy . <p> After the selection came a long period of training . The dancers lived under the strict supervision of the kumu-hula , a dance master skilled in the arts . They adhered to rigid rules regulating diet , behavior , recreation , studies , and practice . <p> The school was usually a large thatched structure called the halau hula , spacious , airy , and closed on all sides to avoid the spying eyes of the villagers . <p> After long and arduous training , when the pupils were judged ready to be seen publicly , they were presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfection of performance was required of every dancer . <p> During the l920s and ' 30s , thanks to Hollywood - Dorothy Lamour in her sarong - and a budding tourist industry , the hula became the enduring emblem of the islands . The more traditional forms have made a comeback since the late 1960s , when native Hawaiians began rediscovering their historical culture . <p> The modern hula is usually danced to songs , while more traditional hulas are danced to a chant known as a mele . Contemporary performances are presented with greater emphasis on the motions than on the words , although the body movements do interpret the words ' meanings to some extent . <p> I wondered just what type of hula was in store for me . <p> As I peered through the window of the island-hopping airplane , Molokai looked daunting - it has a vertical " wall " rising 2,000 feet from the crashing Pacific surf . Ancient Hawaiians named the island molo meaning barren and kai meaning sea . <p> When Capt . James Cook " discovered " Molokai in 1778 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgotten Isle . <p> Precisely because of this isolation , the second-largest concentration of native Hawaiians live here . The largest group lives in the island of Niihau , closed to outsiders . Until tourists saturated Oahu and Maui , few ventured to Molokai . <p> From the airport , Route 460 leads to Kuanakakai , the hub town on the south shore that came to the world 's attention through a song played by the Benny Goodman orchestra about the " cockeyed mayor of Kuanakakai . " Half of the island 's 7,400 citizens live here . <p> Wooden buildings reminiscent of an Old West movie set front the main street . The three-block business district resembles Dodge City and has one traffic light . Six cars constitutes a traffic jam . <p> The story is told that on a sacred hill in Kaana , amid verdant groves , Laka , the goddess of hula , was taught to dance by her sister Kapo . Against her family 's wishes , Laka journeyed from island to island , sharing the sensuous dance with all who wished to learn . Laka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill at Puunana . <p> The site of the birthday celebration was a modest home tucked in the verdant hills near Kuanakakai . Moki , a bright child just learning to toddle , was into everything . On this special day , the gathered relatives indulged and lovingly beamed at him . <p> Sitting on the ground , several elderly women busied themselves making leis from piles of fresh flowers . The men hovered over an open pit where a pig on a spit roasted . Children with round faces and black hair stiff as brush bristles cavorted on the lawn . Picnic tables were laden with fresh tropical fruits and native dishes . <p> About 4 p.m. the elders in the group assembled , sat cross-legged on the ground , and began a slow , rhythmic chant , the mele . A mele is composed to mark an important event such as an earthquake , volcanic eruption , storm , tidal wave , birth , death , war , or nostalgia for a person or place . Moki 's mele had been composed by his godfather . Hula is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began beating on sharkskin-covered drums called pahus . Venerable grandmothers , gray hair streaming down to their shoulders , bodies wrapped in tapa print sarongs , swayed gently . They were joined by girls in tiki leaf skirts , flowers encircling their ankles , wrists , and necks . <p> The men wore red or brown loincloths , some of them over walking shorts . Their legs were strong and muscular from many hours of surfing and climbing . A heady flower scent perfumed the air . <p> In contrast to the wild gyrations I 'd seen in the hotel shows , these dancers kept their bodies stable , both feet planted flat on the ground , swaying into the steps with a natural controlled hip movement . <p> This is known as the aihaa style of hula - low to the ground , knees bent , so the dancers can , tradition says , draw their energy from the earth . <p> Tradition holds that life started from the navel , so the dancers moved from the middle of their bodies . They looked like flowers swayed gently by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracefully back and forth . <p> My friend explained the meaning of the movements : " The day of Moki 's birth . " <p> Another dancer gracefully raised her arms above her head , and then slowly lowered them toward her hips , fingers moving gently . <p> " Rain , " my friend translated . " May God 's blessings rain upon Moki 's head all the days of his life . " <p> The others duplicated the movements with a few variations of their own . A third girl raised her arms high and opened them in a V shape . That meant " may the kindness and greatness of the universe be one with Moki . " <p> Another dancer started with her arms dangling on the sides of her body , slowly raised them above her head , and formed a circle , palms out . Her hips undulated slowly , her eyes turned toward heaven . <p> " May the sun and the moon be one always with Moki , " my friend whispered in my ear . <p> At one point , everyone joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing the rolling surf . Hands cupped together represented little fish that swam over the waves . <p> Moki 's life was honored and celebrated long after the boy fell fast asleep in his mother 's arms . <p> Wishes for God 's grace and favor , for the child 's destiny to be one with the universe , for his good health and long life were expressed in the rhythmic , poetic chants of the mele and in graceful movements of the hula , the great aloha of Molokai . <p> * For more information , contact the Molokai Visitor Association , 1-800-6367 or P.O.
