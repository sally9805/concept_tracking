Family Man <p> The Mellowhorn Home was a rambling one-story log building identifying itself as western  --  the furniture upholstered in fabrics with geometric " Indian " designs , lampshades sporting buckskin fringe . On the walls hung Mr. Mellowhorn 's mounted mule deer heads and a two-man crosscut saw . <p> It was the time of year when Berenice Pann became conscious of the earth 's dark turning , not a good time , she thought , to be starting a job , especially one as depressing as caring for elderly ranch widows . But she took what she could get . There were not many men in the Mellowhorn Retirement Home , and those few were so set upon by the women that Berenice pitied them . She had believed the sex drive faded in the elderly , but these crones vied for the favors of palsied men with beef jerky arms . The men could take their pick of shapeless housecoats and flowery skeletons . <p> Three deceased and stuffed Mellowhorn dogs stood in strategic guard positions  --  near the front door , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from old fence posts . Small signs , the product of the pyrographer 's art , preserved their names : Joker , Bugs and Henry . At least , thought Berenice , patting Henry 's head , the Home had a view of the enclosing mountains . It had rained all day and now , in the stiffening gloom , tufts of bunchgrass showed up like bleached hair . Down along an old irrigation ditch willows made a ragged line of somber maroon , and the stock pond at the bottom of the hill was as flat as zinc . She went to another window to look at coming weather . In the northwest a wedge of sky , milk-white and chill , herded the rain before it . An old man sat at the community room window staring out at the grey autumn . Berenice knew his name , knew all their names ; Ray Forkenbrock . <p> " Get you something , Mr. Forkenbrock ? " She made a point of prefacing the names of residents with the appropriate honorifics , something the rest of the staff did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd all grown up together . Deb Slaver was familiar to a fault , chumming up with " Sammy , " and " Rita " and " Delia , " punctuated with " Hon , " " Sweetie " and " Babes . " <p> " Yeah , " he said . He spoke with long pauses between sentences , a slow unfurling of words that made Berenice want to jump in with word suggestions . <p> " Get me the hell out a here , " he said . <p> " Get me a horse , " he said . <p> " Get me seventy year back a ways , " said Mr. Forkenbrock . <p> " I ca n't do that , but I can get you a nice cup of tea . And it 'll be Social Hour in ten minutes , " she said . <p> She could n't quite meet his stare . He was something to look at , despite an ordinary face with infolded lips , a scrawny neck . It was the eyes . They were very large and wide open and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipped with a pick , faint blue with crystalline rays . In photographs they appeared white like the eyes of Roman statues , saved from that blind stare only by the black dots of pupils . When he looked at you , thought Berenice , you could not understand a word he said for being fixed by those strange white eyes . She did not like him but pretended she did . Women had to pretend to like men and to admire the things they liked . Her own sister had married a man who was interested in rocks and now she had to drag around deserts and steep mountains with him . <p> At Social Hour the residents could have drinks and crackers smeared with cheese paste from the Super Wal-Mart where Cook shopped . They were all lushes , homing in on the whiskey bottle . Chauncey Mellowhorn , who had built the Mellowhorn Retirement Home and set all policy , believed that the last feeble years should be enjoyed , and promoted smoking , drinking , lascivious television programs and plenty of cheap food . Neither teetotalers nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ray Forkenbrock said nothing . Berenice thought he looked sad and she wanted to cheer him up in some way . <p> " What did you used to do , Mr. Forkenbrock ? Were you a rancher ? " <p> The old man glared up at her . " No , " he said . " I was n't no goddamn rancher . I was a hand , " he said . <p> " I worked for them sonsabitches . Cowboyed , ran wild horses , rodeoed , worked in the oil patch , sheared sheep , drove trucks , did whatever , " he said . " Ended up broke . <p> " Now my granddaughter 's husband pays the bills that keep me here in this nest of old women , " he said . He often wished he had died out in the weather , alone and no trouble to anyone . <p> Berenice continued , making her voice cheery . " I had a lot a different jobs too since I graduated high school , " she said . " Waitress , day care , housecleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged to Chad Grills ; they were to be married in the spring and she planned to keep working only for a little while to supplement Chad 's paycheck from Red Bank Power . But before the old man could say anything more Deb Slaver came pushing in , carrying a glass . Berenice could smell the dark whiskey . Deb 's vigorous voice pumped out of her ample chest in jets . <p> " Here you go , honey-boy ! A nice little drinkie for Ray ! " she said . " Turn around from that dark old winder and have some fun ! " She said , " Do n't you want a watch Cops with Powder Face ? " ( Powder Face was Deb 's nickname for a painted harridan with hazelnut knuckles and a set of tawny teeth . ) " Or is it just one a them days when you want a look out the winder and feel blue ? Think of some troubles ? You retired folks do n't know what trouble is , just setting here having a nice glass of whiskey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillows on the settee . " We 're the ones with troubles  --  bills , cheating husbands , sassy kids , tired feet , " she said . " Trying to scrape up the money for winter tires ! My husband says the witch with the green teeth is plaguing us , " she said . " Come on , I 'll set with you and Powder Face awhile , " and she pulled Mr. Forkenbrock by his sweater , threw him onto the settee and sat beside him . <p> Berenice left the room and went to help in the kitchen , where the cook was smacking out turkey patties . A radio on the windowsill murmured . <p> " Looks like it is clearing up , " Berenice said . She was a little afraid of the cook . <p> " Oh good , you 're here . Get them French fry packages out of the freezer , " she said . " Thought I was going to have to do everthing myself . Deb was supposed to help , but she rather tangle up with them old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Some of them 's got a little property or a mineral-rights check coming in , " she said . " You ever meet her husband , Duck Slaver ? " Now she was grating a cabbage into a stainless steel bowl . <p> Berenice knew only that Duck Slaver drove a tow truck for Ricochet Towing . The radio suddenly caught the cook 's attention and she turned up the volume , hearing that it would be cloudy the next day with gradual clearing , the following day high winds and snow showers . <p> " We ought to be grateful for the rain in this drought . Know what Bench says ? " Bench was the UPS driver , the source of Cook 's information on everything from road conditions to family squabbles . <p> " No . " <p> " Says we are in the beginning of turning into a desert . It 's all going to blow away , " she said . <p> When Berenice went to announce dinner  --  turkey patties , French fries ( Mr. Mellowhorn still called them " freedom fries " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and homemade rolls  --  she saw that Deb had worked Mr. Forkenbrock into the corner of the settee , and Powder Face was in the chair with the bad leg watching cops squash the faces of black men onto sidewalks . Mr. Forkenbrock was staring at the dark window , the coursing raindrops catching the blue television flicker . He gave off an aura of separateness . Deb and Powder Face might have been two more of Mellowhorn 's stuffed dogs . <p> After dinner , on her way back to the kitchen to help the cook clean up , Berenice opened the door for a breath of fresh air . The eastern half of the sky was starry , the west a slab of basalt . <p> In the early morning darkness the rain began again . He did not know but would have understood the poet 's line " I wake and feel the fell of dark , not day . " Nothing in nature seemed more malign to Ray Forkenbrock than this invisible crawl of weather , the blunt-nosed cloud advancing under the lid of darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing solution , the sound of the rain sharpened . That 's sleet , he thought , remembering a long October ride in such weather when he was young , his denim jacket soaked through and sparkling with ice , remembered meeting up with that old horse catcher who lived out in the desert , must have been in his eighties , out there in the rattling precip limping along , heading for the nearest ranch bunkhouse , he said , to get out of the weather . <p> " That 'd be Flying A , " said Ray , squinting against the slanting ice . <p> " Ai n't that Hawkins 's place ? " <p> " Naw . Hawkins sold out couple years ago . A fella named Fox owns it now , " he said . <p> " Hell , I lose touch out here . Had a pretty good shack up until day before yesterday , " the horse catcher said between clicking teeth and went on to tell that his place had burned down and he 'd slept out in the sage for two nights but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . Ray felt bad for him and at the same time wanted to get away . It seemed awkward to be mounted while the man was afoot , but then he always had that same uncomfortable , guilty itch when he rode past a pedestrian . Was it his fault the old man did n't have a horse ? If he was any good at horse catching he should have had a hundred of them . He foraged through his pockets and found three or four stale peanuts mixed with lint . <p> " It ai n't much but it 's all I got , " he said , holding them out . <p> The old boy had never made it to the Flying A. He was discovered days later sitting with his back against a rock . Roy remembered the uncomfortable feeling he 'd had exchanging a few words with him , thinking how old he was . Now he was the same age , and he had reached the Flying A  --  the warmth and dry shelter of the Mellowhorn Home . But the old horse catcher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was six-thirty and there was nothing to get up for , but he put on his jeans and shirt , added an old man 's sweater as the dining room could be chilly in the morning before the heat got going , left his boots in the closet and shuffled down the hall in red felt slippers , too soft to deliver a kick to stuffed Bugs with the googly eyes at the foot of the stairs . The slippers were a gift from his only granddaughter , Beth , married to Kevin Bead . Beth was important to him . He had made up his mind to tell her the ugly family secret . He would not leave his descendants to grapple with shameful uncertainties . He was going to clear the air . Beth was coming on Saturday afternoon with her tape recorder to help him get it said . During the week she would type it into her computer and bring him the crisp printed pages . He might have been nothing more than a ranch hand in his life , but he knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks that looked freshly slapped . It was the Irish in her he supposed . She bit her fingernails , an unsightly habit in a grown woman . Her husband , Kevin , worked in the loan department of the High Plains Bank . He complained that his job was stupid , tossing money and credit cards to people who could never pay up . <p> " Used to be to get a card you had to work hard and have good credit . Now the worse your credit the easier it is to get a dozen of them , " he said to his wife 's grandfather . Ray , who had never had a credit card , could n't follow the barrage of expository information that followed about changing bank rules , debt . These information sessions always ended with Kevin sighing and saying in a dark tone that the day was coming . <p> Ray Forkenbrock guessed Beth would use the computer at the real estate office where she worked to transcribe his words . <p> " Oh no , Grandpa , we 've got a computer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it in the office , " she said . Rosalyn was her boss , a woman Ray had never seen but felt he knew well because Beth talked often about her . She was very , very fat and had financial trouble . Scam artists several times stole her identity . Every few months she spent hours filling out fraud affidavits . And , said Beth , she wore XXXL blue jeans and a belt with a silver buckle as big as a pie tin that she had won at a bingo game . <p> Ray snorted . " A buckle used to mean something , " he said . " A rodeo buckle , best part of the prize . The money was nothing in them days , " he said . " We did n't care about the money . We cared about the buckle , " he said , " and now fat gals win them at bingo games ? " He twisted his head around and looked at the closet door . Beth knew he must have a belt with a rodeo buckle in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television ? " she said . " Or the bull-riding championship ? " <p> " Hell , no , " he said . " The old hens here would n't put up with it . They got that teevee lined out from dawn to midnight  --  crime , that reality shit , fashion and python shows , dog and cat programs . Watch rodeo ? Not a chance , " he said . <p> He glared at the empty hall beyond the open door . " You would n't never guess the most of them lived on ranches all their life , " he added sourly . <p> Beth spoke to Mr. Mellowhorn and said she thought her grandfather could at least watch the National Finals or the PBR rodeos considering what they were paying for his keep . Mr. Mellowhorn agreed . <p> " But I like to keep out of residents ' television choices , you know , democracy rules at the Mellowhorn Home , and if your grandfather wants to watch rodeo all he has to do is persuade a majority of the inhabitants to sign a petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if my husband and I get him a television set for his room ? " <p> " Well , no , of course not , but I should just mention that the less fortunate residents might see him as privileged , even a little high-hat if he holes up in his room and watches rodeo instead of joining the community choice  --  " <p> " Fine , " said Beth , cutting past the social tyranny of the Mellowhorn Home . " That 's what we 'll do , then . Get him a snooty , high-hat television . Family counts with me and Kevin , " she said . " I do n't suppose you have a satellite hookup , do you ? " she asked . <p> " Well , no . We 've discussed it , but  --  maybe next year  --  " <p> She brought Ray a small television set with a DVD player and three or four discs of recent years ' rodeo events . That got him going . <p> " Christ , I remember when the finals was in Oklahoma City , not goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull riding has pushed out all the other events now , good-bye saddle bronc and bareback . I was there when Freckles Brown rode Tornado in 1962 , " he said . " Forty-six year old , and the ones they got now bull riding are children ! Make a million dollars . It 's all show business now , " he said . " The old boys was a rough crew . Heavy drinkers , most of them . You want to know what pain is , try bull riding with a bad hangover . " <p> " So I guess you did a lot of rodeo riding when you were young ? " <p> " No , not a lot , but enough to get broke up some . And earned a buckle , " he said . " You heal fast when you 're young , but the broke places sort of come back to life when you are old . I busted my left leg in three places . Hurts now when it rains , " he said . <p> " How come you cowboyed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rancher or a cowboy , was he ? " She turned the volume knob down . The riders came out of a chute , again and again , monotonously , all apparently wearing the same dirty hat . <p> " Hell no , he was n't . He was a coal miner . Rove Forkenbrock , " he said . " My mother 's name was Alice Grand Forkenbrock . Dad worked in the Union Pacific coal mines . Something happened to him and he quit . Moved into running errands for different outfits , Texaco , California Petroleum , big outfits . <p> " Anyway , do n't exactly know what the old man did . Drove a dusty old Model T. He 'd get fired and then he had to scratch around for another job . Even though he drank  --  that 's what got him fired usually  --  he always seemed to get another job pretty quick . " He swallowed a little whiskey . <p> " Anymore I would n't go near the mines . I liked horses almost as much as I liked arithmetic , liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dad said better forget high school , things were tough and I had to find work , " he said . " At the time I did n't mind . What my dad said I generally did n't fuss over . I respected him . I respected and honored my father . I believed him to be a good and fair man . " He thought , unaccountably , of weeds . <p> " I tried for a job and got took on at Bledsoe 's Double B , " he said . " The bunkhouse life . The Bledsoes more or less raised me to voting age . At that point I sure did n't want nothing to do with my family , " he said and fell into an old man 's reverie . Weeds , weeds and wildness . <p> Beth was quiet for a few minutes , then chatted about her boys . Syl had acted the part of an eagle in a school play and what a job , making the costume ! Just before she left she said offhandedly , " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think if I bring my recorder and get it on tape and then type it up ? It would be like a book of your life  --  something for the future generations of the family to read and know about . " <p> He laughed in derision . <p> " Some of it ai n't so nice to know . Every family got its dirty laundry and we got ours . " But after a week of thinking about it , of wondering why he 'd kept it bottled up for so long , he told Beth to bring on her machine . <p> They sat in his little room with the door closed . <p> " ' Antisocial , ' they 'll say . Everybody else sits with the door open hollering at each other 's folks as if they was all related somehow . A regional family , they call it here . I like my privacy . " <p> She put a glass of whiskey , another of water and the tape recorder , smaller than a pack of cigarettes , on the table near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa . Tell me how it was growing up in the old days . Just talk any time you are ready . " <p> He cleared his throat and began slowly , watching the spiky volume meter jump . " I 'm eighty-four years old and most of them involved in the early days has gone on before , so it do n't make much difference what I tell . " He took a nervous swallow of the whiskey and nodded . <p> " I was fourteen year old in nineteen and thirty-three and there was n't a nickel in the world . " The silence of that time before traffic and leaf blowers and the boisterous shouting of television was embedded in his character , and he spoke little , finding it hard to drag out the story . The noiselessness of his youth except for the natural sound of wind , hoofbeats , the snap of the old house logs splitting in winter cold , wild herons crying their way downriver was forever lost . How silent men and women had been in those times , trusting to observational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache clouds moved , and he could imagine them making no more sound than dragging a feather across a wire . The wind got them and the sky was alone . <p> " When I was a kid we lived hard , let me tell you . Coalie Town , about eight miles from Superior . It 's all gone now , " he said . " Three-room shack , no insulation , kids always sick . My baby sister Goldie died of meningitis in that shack , " he said . <p> Now he was warming up to his sorry tale . " No water . A truck used to come every week and fill up a couple barrels we had . Mama paid a quarter a barrel . No indoor plumbing . People make jokes about it now but it was miserable to go out there to that outhouse on a bitter morning with the wind screaming up the hole . Christ , " he said . He was silent for so long Beth backed up the tape and pressed the pause button on the recorder . He lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth lost a sentence or two before she got the recorder restarted . <p> " People thought they was doing all right if they was alive . You can learn to eat dust instead of bread , my mother said many a time . She had a lot a old sayings . Is that thing on ? " he said . <p> " Yes , Grandpa , " she said . " It is on . Just talk . " <p> " Bacon , " he said . " She 'd say if bacon curls in the pan the hog was butchered wrong side of the moon . We did n't see bacon very often and it could of done corkscrews in the pan , would have been okay with us long as we could eat it , " he said . <p> " There was a whole bunch a shacks out there near the mines . They called it Coalie Town . Lot of foreigners . <p> " As I come up , " he said , " I got a pretty good education in fighting , screwing  --  pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved with a fight . I remember all them people . Pattersons , Bob Hokker , the Grainblewer twins , Alex Sugar , Forrie Wintka , Harry and Joe Dolan ... We had a lot of fun . Kids always have fun , " he said . <p> " They sure do , " said Beth . <p> " Kids do n't get all sour thinking about the indoor toilets they do n't have , or moaning because there ai n't no fresh butter . For us everthing was fine the way it was . I had a happy childhood . When we got bigger there was certain girls . Forrie Wintka . Really good looking , long black hair and black eyes , " he said , looking to see if he had shocked her . <p> " She finally married old man Dolan after his wife died . The Dolan boys was something else . They hated each other , fought , really had bad fights , slugged each other with boards with nails in the end , heaved rocks . " <p> Beth tried to shift him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on about the Dolans . <p> " I 'm pretty set in my ways , " he said . She nodded . <p> " One time Joe knocked Harry out , kicked him into the Platte . He could of drowned , probably would of but Dave Arthur was riding along the river , seen this bundle of rags snarled up in a cottonwood sweeper  --  it had fell in the river and caught up all sorts of river trash . He thought maybe some clothes . Went to see and pulled Harry out , " he said . <p> " Harry was about three-quarters dead , never was right after that , neither . But right enough to know that his own brother had meant to kill him . Joe could n't never tell if Harry was going to be around the next corner with a chunk of wood or a gun . " There was a long pause after the word " gun . " <p> " Nervous wreck , " he said . He watched the tape revolve for long seconds . <p> " Dutchy Green was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was twenty-five , twenty-six , shooting at some of them old Indian rock carvings . The ricochet got him through the right temple , " he said . <p> He took a swallow of whiskey . " Yep , our family . There was my mother . She was tempery , too much to do and no money to do it . Me , the oldest . There was a big brother , Sonny , but he drowned in an irrigation ditch before I come along , " he said . <p> " Were n't there girls in the family ? " asked Beth . Not content with two sons , she craved a daughter . <p> " My sisters , Irene and Daisy . Irene lives in Greybull and Daisy is still alive out in California . And I mentioned , the baby Goldie died when I was around six or seven . The youngest survivor was Roger . Mama 's last baby . He went the wrong way . Did time for robbing , " he said .

Him and Mother was always kissing and hugging and laughing when he was home . He was a wonderful man with kids , always a big smile and a hug , remembered all your interests , lots of times brought home special little presents . I still got every one he give me . " His voice trembled like that of the old horse catcher in the antique sleet . <p> " Remembering this stuff makes me tired . I guess I better stop , " he said . " Anymore two new people come in today and the new ones always makes me damn tired . " <p> " Women or men ? " asked Beth , relieved to turn the recorder off as she could see her only tape was on short time . She remembered now she had recorded the junior choir practice . <p> " Do n't know , " he said . " Find out at supper . " <p> " I 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for this family . " She kissed his dry old man 's forehead , brown age spots . <p> " Just wait , " he said . <p> After she left he started talking again as if the tape were still running . " He died age forty-seven . I thought that was real old . Why did n't he jump ? " he said . <p> Berenice Pann , bearing a still-warm chocolate cupcake , paused outside his door when she heard his voice . She had seen Beth leave a few minutes earlier . Maybe she had forgotten something and come back . Berenice heard something like a strangled sob from Mr. Forkenbrock . " God , it was lousy , " he said . " So we could work . Hell , I liked school . No chance when you start work at thirteen , " he said . " Was n't for the Bledsoes I 'd ended up a bum , " he said to himself . " Or worse . " <p> Berenice Pann 's boyfriend , Chad Grills , was the great-grandson of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Forkenbrock had worked in his early days , both of them over the century mark . Berenice became an avid eavesdropper , feeling that in a way she was related to Mr. Forkenbrock through the Bledsoes . She owed it to herself and Chad to hear as much as she could about the Bledsoes , good or bad . Inside the room there was silence , then the door flung open . <p> " Uh ! " cried Berenice , the cupcake sliding on its saucer . " I was just bringing you this  --  " <p> " That so ? " said Mr. Forkenbrock . He took the cupcake from the saucer and instead of taking a sample bite crammed the whole thing into his mouth , paper cup and all . The paper massed behind his dentures . <p> At the Social Hour , Mr. Mellowhorn arrived to introduce the new " guests . " Church Bollinger was a younger man , barely sixty-five , but Roy could tell he was a real slacker . He 'd obviously come into the Home because he could n't get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes . The other one , Mrs. Terry Taylor , was around his age , early eighties despite the dyed red hair and carmine fingernails . She seemed soft and sagging , somehow like a candle standing in the sun . She kept looking at Ray . Her eyes were khaki-colored , the lashes sparse and short , her thin old lips greased up with enough lipstick to leave red on her buttered roll . Finally he could take her staring no longer . <p> " Got a question ? " he said . <p> " Are you Ray Forkenknife ? " she said . <p> " Forkenbrock , " he said , startled . <p> " Oh , right . Forkenbrock . You do n't remember me ? Theresa Worley ? From Coalie Town ? Me and you went to school together except you was a couple grades ahead . " <p> But he did not remember her . <p> The next morning , fork poised over the poached egg reclining like a houri on a bed of soggy toast , he glanced up to meet her intense gaze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly her own , for no dentist would make dentures that looked as though they had been dredged from a sewage pit . <p> " Do n't you remember Mrs. Wilson ?

" <p> He did remember something about a schoolteacher frozen in a June blizzard but thought it had happened somewhere else , down around Cold Mountain . As for the Skeltcher kids , he denied them and shook his head . <p> On Saturday Beth came again , and again set out the glass of water , the glass of whiskey and the tape recorder . He had been thinking what he wanted to say . It was clear enough in his head , but putting it into words was difficult . The whole thing had been so subtle and painful it was impossible to present it without sounding like a fool . And Mrs. Terry Taylor , a.k.a . Theresa Worley , had sidelined him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeltcher kids in the mine shaft , how Mr. Baker had shot Mr. Dennison over a bushel of potatoes and a dozen other tragedies she had laid out as mnemonic bait .

It was late autumn , the cottonwoods leafless along the grim trickle of Coal Creek , warm weather holding . They could see Forrie Wintka toiling up from the shacks below . Dutchy said it would be easy , not only would she show them , they could do it to her , even her brother did it to her . <p> Dutchy whispered as though she could hear them . " Even her stepfather . He got killed by a mountain line last year . " <p> And now , seventy-one years later , it hit him .

I knew her and it was n't under the best circumstances , " he said . That was the trouble with Wyoming ; everything you ever did or said kept pace with you right to the end . The regional family again . <p> Mr. Mellowhorn started a series of overnight outings he dubbed " Weekend Adventures . " The first one had been to the Medicine Wheel up in the Big Horns . Mrs. Wallace Kimes had fallen and scraped her knees on the crushed stone in the parking lot . Then came the dude ranch weekend where the Mellowhorn group found itself sharing the premises with seven elk hunters from Colorado , most of them drunk and disorderly and given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed senselessly with them . The third trip was more ambitious ; a five-day excursion to the Grand Canyon where no one at the Mellowhorn Home had ever been . Twelve people signed up despite the hefty fee to pay for lodging and transportation . <p> " You only live once ! " cried Powder Face . <p> The group included newcomer Church Bollinger and Forrie Wintka , a.k.a . Theresa Worley , a.k.a . Terry Dolan and , finally , as Terry Taylor . Forrie and Bollinger sat together in the van , had drinks together in the bar of El Tovar , ate dinner at a table for two and planned a trail-ride expedition for the next morning . But before the mule train left , Forrie asked Bollinger to take some photographs she could send to her granddaughters . She stood on the parapet with the famous view behind her . She posed with one hand holding her floppy new straw hat purchased in the hotel gift shop . She took off the hat and turned , shading her eyes with her hand , and pretended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She clowned , pretending she was unsteady and losing her balance . There was a stifled " Oh ! " and she disappeared . A park ranger rushed to the parapet and saw her on the slope ten feet below , clutching at a small plant . Her hat lay to one side . Even as he climbed over the parapet and reached for her , the plant trembled and loosened . Forrie dug her fingers into the gravel as she began to slide toward the edge . The ranger thrust his foot toward her , shouting for her to grab on . But his saving kick connected with Forrie 's hand . She shot down the slope as one on a waterslide , leaving ten deep grooves to mark her trail , then , in a last desperate effort , reached for and almost seized her new straw hat . <p> The subdued group returned to Wyoming the next day . Again and again they told each other that she had not even cried out as she fell , something they believed denoted strong character . <p> Ray Forkenbrock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes after Beth arrived before taking up a listening post outside the room . Mr. Forkenbrock had a monotonous but loud voice , and she could hear every word . <p> " So , things was better for the family after he got the jobs driving machine parts around to the oil rigs , " he said . " The money was pretty good and he joined some one of them fraternal organizations , the Pathfinders . And they had a ladies ' auxiliary , which my mother got into ; they called it ' The Ladies , ' like it was a restroom or something . They both got real caught up in Pathfinders , the ceremonies , the lodge , the good deeds and oaths of allegiance to whatever . <p> " Mother was always baking something for them , " he said . " And there was kid stuff for us , fishing derbies and picnics and sack races . It was like Boy Scouts , or so they said . Boy Scouts with a ranch twist , because there was always some class in hackamore braiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mix of Scouts and 4-H which we did not belong to . " <p> Berenice found this all rather boring . When would he say something about the Bledsoes ? She saw Deb Slaver at the far end of the hall coming out of Mr. Harrell 's room with a tray of bandages . Mr. Harrell had a sore on his shin that would n't heal and the dressing had to be changed twice a day . <p> " Now do n't you pick at it , you bad boy ! " yelled Deb , disappearing around the corner . <p> " Anyway , Mother was probably more into it than Dad . She liked company and had n't had much luck with neighbors there in Coalie Town . The Ladies got up a program of history tours to various massacre sites and old logging flumes . Mother loved those trips . She had a little taste for what had happened in the long ago . She 'd come home all excited and carrying a pretty rock . She had about a dozen rocks from those trips when she died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of her sister toiling up rocky slopes , trying to please her rock hound husband , carrying his canvas sack of stones . <p> " The first hint I got that there was something peculiar in our family tree was when she come home from a visit to Farson . I do not know what they were doing there , and she said that the Farson Auxiliary had served them lunch  --  potato salad and hot dogs , " he said . <p> " One of the Farson ladies said she knew a Forkenbrock down in Dixon . She thought he had a ranch in the Snake River valley . Well , my ears perked up when I heard ' ranch , ' " he said . <p> " And Forkenbrock ai n't that common of a name . So I asked Mother if they were Dad 's relatives , " he said . " I would of liked it if we had ranch kin . I was already thinking about getting into cowboy ways . She said no , that Dad was an orphan , that it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner that night , once Forrie Wintka 's dramatic demise had been hashed through again , Church Bollinger began to describe his travels through the Canadian Rockies . <p> " What we 'd do is fly , then rent a car instead of driving . Those interstates will kill you . The wife enjoyed staying at nice hotels . So we flew to San Francisco and decided to drive down the coast . We stopped in Hollywood . Figured we 'd see what Hollywood was all about . They had these big concrete columns . Time came to leave , I got in and backed up and crunch , could n't get out . I finally got out but I had a bad scratched door on the rental car . Well , I bought some paint and I painted it and you could never tell . I drove to San Diego . Waited for a letter from the rental outfit but it never came . Another time I rented a car there was a crack in the windshield . I says , ' Is this a safety problem ? ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drive off and it never was a problem . We did the same thing when we went to Europe . In Spain we went to the bullfights . We left after two . I wanted to experience that . " <p> " But are they wounded ? " asked Powder Face . <p> Mr. Bollinger , thinking of rental cars , did not reply . <p> When Berenice told Chad Grills about old Mr. Forkenbrock who used to work for his grandparents , he was interested and said he would talk to them about it next time he went out to the ranch . He said he hoped Berenice liked ranch life because he was in line to inherit the place . He told Berenice to find out all she could about Forkenbrock 's working days . Some of those cagey old boys managed to get themselves situated to put a claim on a ranch through trumped-up charges of unpaid back wages . Whenever Beth came with her tape recorder , Berenice found something to do in the hall outside Ray Forkenbrock 's room , listening , expecting him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what Chad would do . <p> Ray said , " I think when she heard about the Dixon Forkenbrocks , Mother had a little feeling that something was n't right because she wrote back to the Farson lady thanking her for the nice lunch . I think she wanted to strike up a friendship so she could find out more about the Dixon people , but , far as I know , that did n't happen . It stuck in my mind that we was n't the only Forkenbrock family . " Beth was glad he did n't pause so often now that he was into the story , letting his life unreel . <p> " The last day of school was a trip and a big picnic . The whole outfit usually went on the picnic , since learning academies of the day was small and scattered . When I was twelve the seventh grade had only three kids  --  me , one of my sisters who skipped a grade and Dutchy Green . We was excited when we found out the trip was to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ratus , the teacher , got the map of Wyoming hung up and showed us where it was . I seen the word ' Dixon ' down near the bottom of the map . Dixon ! That 's where the mystery Forkenbrocks lived . Dutchy was my best friend and I told him all about it and we tried to figure a way to get the bus to stop in Dixon . Maybe there 'd be a sign for the Forkenbrock Ranch , " he said . <p> " As it turned out , " he said , " we stopped in Dixon anyways because there was something wrong with the bus . <p> " There was a pretty good service station in Dixon that had been an old blacksmith shop . The forge was still there and the big bellows , which us boys took turns working , pretending we had a horse in the stall . I asked the mechanic who was fixing the bus if he knew of any Forkenbrocks in town and he said he heard of them but did n't know them . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me played blacksmith some more but we never got to Butch Cassidy 's cabin because they could n't fix the bus and another one had to come take us back . We ate the picnic on the bus on the way home . After that I kind of forgot about the Dixon Forkenbrocks , " he said . He was beginning to slow down again . <p> " I did n't think about it until Dad died in an automobile accident on old route 30 , " he said . <p> " He was taking a shortcut , driving on the railroad ties , and a train come along , " he said . <p> He said , " I 'd been working for the Bledsoes for a year and had n't been home . " <p> At the mention of the Bledsoes , Berenice , out in the hallway , snapped her head up . <p> " Mr. Bledsoe drove me back so I could attend the funeral . They had it in Rawlins and the Pathfinders had took care of everything , " he said . <p> Beth looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belonged to . Pathfinders . All we had to do with it was show up . Which we done . Preacher , casket , flowers , Pathfinder flags and mottoes , grave plot , headstone  --  all fixed up by the Pathfinders . " He coughed and took a sip of whiskey , thinking of cemetery weeds and beyond the headstones the yellow wild pastures . <p> Berenice could n't listen anymore because the chime for Cook 's Treats rang . It was part of her job to bring the sweets to the residents , the high point in their day trumped only by the alcoholic Social Hour . Cook was sliding triangles of hot apple pie onto plates . <p> " You hear about Deb 's husband ? Had a heart attack while he was hitching the tow bar to some tourist . He 's in the hospital . It 's pretty serious , touch and go . So we wo n't be seeing Deb for a little while . Maybe ever . I bet she 's got a million insurance on him . If he dies and Deb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take out a policy on my old man . " <p> When Berenice carried out the tray of pie , Mr. Forkenbrock 's door stood open and Beth was gone . <p> Sundays Berenice and Chad Grills drove out on the back roads in Chad 's almost-new truck . Going for a ride was their kind of date . The dust was bad , churned up by the fast-moving energy company trucks . Chad got lost because of all the new , unmarked roads the companies had put in . Time after time they turned onto a good road only to end up at a dead-end compression station or well pad . Getting lost where you had been born , brought up and never left was embarrassing , and Chad cursed the gas outfits . Finally he took a sight line on Doty Peak and steered toward it , picking the bad roads as the true way . Always his mind seized on a mountain . In a flinty section they had a flat tire . They came out at last near the ghost town of Dad . Chad said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree , though it had n't been the worst . <p> Deb Slaver did not come in all the next week , and the extra work fell on Berenice . She hated changing Mr. Harrell 's bandage and skipped the chore several times . She was glad when on Wednesday , Doc Nelson 's visit day , he said Mr. Harrell had to go into the hospital . On Saturday , Beth 's day to visit Mr. Forkenbrock , Berenice got through her chores in a hurry so she could lean on a dust mop outside the door and listen . Impossible to know what he 'd say next with all the side stories about his mother 's garden , long-ago horses , old friends . He hardly ever mentioned the Bledsoes who had been so good to him . <p> " Grandpa , " said Beth . " You look tired . Not sleeping enough ? What time do you go to bed ? " She handed him the printout of his discourse . <p> " My age you do n't need sleep so much as a rest . Permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This looks pretty good  --  reads easy as a book . " He was pleased . " Where did we leave off , " he said , turning the pages . <p> " Your dad 's funeral , " said Beth . <p> " Oh boy , " he said . " That was the day I think Mother begin to put two and two together . I sort of got it , at least I got it that something ugly had happened , but I did n't really understand until years later . I loved my dad so I did n't want to understand . I still got a little Buck knife he give me and I would n't part with it for anything in this world , " he said . <p> There was a pause while he got up to look for the knife , found it , showed it to Beth and carefully put it away in his top drawer . <p> " So there we all were , filing out of the church on our way to the cars that take us to the graveyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls out , " Mrs. Forkenbrock ! Oh , Mrs. Forkenbrock ! " Mother turns around and we see this big fat lady in black with a wilted lilac pinned on her coat heading for us , " he said . <p> " But she sails right past , goes over to a thin , homely woman with a boy around my age and offers her condolences . And then she says , looking at the kid , ' Oh , Ray , you 'll have to be the man of the house now and help your mother every way you can , ' " he said . He paused to pour into the whiskey glass . <p> " I want you to think about that , Beth , " he said . " You are so strong on family ties . I want you to imagine that you are at your father 's funeral with your mother and sisters and somebody calls your mother , then walks right over to another person . And that other person has a kid with her and that kid has your name . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the Dixon Forkenbrocks and that they was related to us after all . Mother did n't say a word , but I could feel her arm jerk , " he said . He illustrated this by jerking his own elbow . <p> " At the cemetery I went over to the kid with my name and asked him if they lived in Dixon and if they had a ranch and was they related to my father who we was burying . He gives me a look and says they do n't have a ranch , they do n't live in Dixon but in LaBarge , and that it is his father we are burying . I was so mixed up at this point that I just said ' You 're crazy ! ' and went back to Mother 's side . She never mentioned the incident and finally we went home and got along like usual although with damn little money . Mother got work cooking at the Sump ranch . It was only when she died in 1975 that I put the pieces together , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berenice and Chad went for their weekly ride . Berenice brought her new digital camera . For some reason Chad insisted on going back to the tangle of energy roads , and it was almost the same as before  --  a spiderweb of wrong-turn gravel roads without signs . Far ahead of them they could see trucks at the side of the road . There was a deep ditch with black pipe in it big enough for a dog to stroll through . They came around a corner and men were feeding a section of pipe into a massive machine that welded the sections together . Berenice thought the machine was interesting and put her camera up . Behind the machine a truck idled , a grubby kid in dark glasses behind the wheel . Thirty feet away another man was filling in the ditch with a backhoe . Chad put his window down , grinned and , in an easy voice , asked the kid how the machine worked . <p> The kid looked at Berenice 's camera . " What the fuck do you care ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " County road , " said Chad , flaring up , " and I live in this county . I was born here . I got more rights to be on this road than you do . " <p> The kid gave a nasty laugh . " Hey , I do n't care if you was born on top of a flagpole , you got no rights interferin with this work and takin pictures . " <p> " Interfering ? " But before he could say any more the man inside the pipe machine got out and the two who had been handling the pipe walked over . The backhoe driver jumped down . They all looked salty and in good shape . " Hell , " said Chad , " we 're just out for a Sunday ride . Did n't expect to see anybody working on Sunday . Thought it was just us ranch types got to do that . Have a good day , " and he trod on the accelerator , peeling out in a burst of dust . Gravel pinged the undercarriage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " but Chad snapped " Shut up " and drove too fast until they got to the blacktop and then he floored it , looking in the rearview all the way . They did n't speak until they were back at Berenice 's . Chad got out and walked around the truck , looking it over . <p> " Chad , how come you to let them throw off on you like that ? " said Berenice . <p> " Berenice , " he said carefully , " I guess that you did n't see one a them guys had a .44 on him and he was taking it out of the holster . It is not a good idea to have a fight on the edge of a ditch with five roustabouts in a remote area . Loser goes in the ditch and the backhoe guy puts in five more minutes of work . Take a look at this , " he said , and he pulled her around to the back of the truck . There was a hole in the tailgate . <p> " That 's Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good thing the road was rough . I could be dead and you could still be out there entertaining them . " Berenice shuddered . " Probably , " said Chad , " they thought we were some kind of environmentalists . That camera of yours . Leave it home next time . " <p> Right then Berenice began to cool toward Chad . He seemed less manly . And she would take her camera wherever she wanted . <p> On Monday Berenice was in the kitchen looking for the ice cream freezer which had n't been used for two years . Mr. Mellowhorn had just come back from Jackson with a recipe for apple pie ice cream and he was anxious for everyone to share his delight . As she fumbled in the dark cupboard Deb Slaver banged in , bumping the cupboard door . <p> " Ow ! " said Berenice . <p> " Serves you right , " snarled Deb , sweeping out again . There was a sound in the hall as of someone kicking a stuffed dog . <p> " She 's pretty mad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get the million-dollar insurance , but even worse , he 's going to need dedicated care for the rest of his life  --  hand and foot waiting on , nice smooth pillows . She 's got to take care of him forever . I do n't know if she 'll keep working and try to get an aide to come in or what . Or maybe Mr. Mellowhorn will let him stay here . Then we 'll all get to wait on him hand and foot . " <p> Saturday came , and out of habit , because she had broken up with Chad and no longer really cared about the Bledsoes or their ranch , Berenice hung around in the hall outside Mr. Forkenbrock 's room . Beth had brought him a dish of chocolate pudding . He said it was good but not as good as whiskey and she poured out his usual glass . <p> " So , " said Beth . " At the funeral you met the other Forkenbrocks but they did n't live in Dixon anymore ? " <p> " No . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard a thing . The ones at the funeral were not the Dixon Forkenbrocks . They was the LaBarge Forkenbrocks . There was another set in Dixon . When Mother died , me and my sisters had a go through her stuff and sort it all out , " he said . <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Beth . " I guess I misunderstood . " <p> " She had collected all Dad 's obituaries she could find . She never said a word to us . Kept them in a big envelope marked ' Our Family . ' I never knew if she meant that sarcastic or not . The usual stuff about how he was born in Nebraska , worked for Union Pacific , then for Ohio Oil and this company and that , how he was a loyal Pathfinder . One said he was survived by Lottie Forkenbrock and six children in Chadron , Nebraska . The boy was named Ray . Another said his grieving family lived in Dixon , Wyoming , and included his wife Sarah-Louise and two sons , Ray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was a well-known Pathfinder survived by wife Alice , sons Ray and Roger , daughters Irene and Daisy . That was us . The last one said his wife was Nancy up in LaBarge and the kids were Daisy , Ray and Irene . That was four sets . What he done , see , was give all the kids the same names so he would n't get mixed up and say ' Fred ' when it was Ray . " <p> He was breathless , his voice high and tremulous . " How my mother felt about this surprise he give her I never knew because she did n't say a word , " he said . <p> He swallowed his whiskey in a gulp and coughed violently , ending with a retching sound . He mopped tears from his eyes . " My sisters bawled their eyes out when they read those death notices and they cursed him , but when they went back home they never said anything , " he said . " Everybody , the ones in LaBarge and Dixon and Chadron and god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . Until now . I think I 'll have another whiskey . All this talking kind of dries my throat , " he said , and he got the bottle himself . <p> " Well , " said Beth , trying to make amends for misunderstanding , " at least we 've got this extended family now . It 's exciting finding out about all the cousins . " <p> " Beth , they are not cousins . Think about it , " he said . He had thought she was smart . She was n't . <p> " Honestly , I think it 's cool . We could all get together for Thanksgiving . Or Fourth of July . " <p> Ray Forkenbrock 's shoulders sagged . Time was swinging down like a tire on the end of a rope , slowing , letting the old cat die . <p> " Grandfather , " said Beth gently . " You have to learn to love your relatives . " <p> He said nothing , and then , " I loved my father . <p> " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hopeless , that she was not smart and she did n't understand any of what he 'd said , that the book he thought he was dictating would be regarded as an old man 's senile rubbish . Unbidden , as wind shear hurls a plane down , the memory of the old betrayal broke the prison of his rage and he damned them all , pushed the tape recorder away and told Beth she had better go back home to her husband . <p> " It 's ridiculous , " Beth said to Kevin . " He got all worked up about his father who died back in the 1930s . You 'd think there would have been closure by now . " <p> " You 'd think , " said Kevin , his face seeming to twitch in the alternating dim and dazzle of the television set . <p> Copyright 2008 by Dead Line , Ltd . <br> Continues ...
