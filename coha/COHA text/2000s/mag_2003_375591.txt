Still using an ordinary phone line to get online ? If so , you may feel like a kid with his nose pressed against a toy-store window . Inside are the lucky kids with those always-on DSL or cable modems , happily downloading a dozen times as fast as you can and not having to go off-line every time Mom wants to call . But times are tight , and you do n't have a lot of extra cash to shell out every month . How can you afford to join their party ? <P> Take heart . There are still more of us outside the window than in . ( About 54 million households in the U.S. dial into the Internet , 11 million use cable modems , and 5.4 million get DSL . ) Cable companies and especially telcos are getting desperate to lure you into the toy store , and prices for that access are plummeting . Just watch out for the attached strings . <P> Bell South is trying to tempt customers with a service called DSL Lite  --  a sixth of the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 56K dial-up ) for $34.95 a month , a $10 discount on the telco 's regular DSL . But that 's highly expensive compared with offers in the North and West . Verizon and SBC have both dropped their full-speed DSL service to $29.95 a month . The catches : Bell South and Verizon make you buy a bundle of services on your phone line or pay $5 a month extra , while SBC 's offer is guaranteed only until September . <P> Because they already have the lion 's share of broadband , cable companies have been slower to slash prices . The exception is New York 's RCN , which recently rolled out Value Modem , its version of DSL Lite , for $29.95 a month . Yes , you have to buy a cable-service bundle to get that price  --  but you also get a $5-a-month discount if you supply your own modem . <P> If none of these offers are tempting enough , you could try boosting your dial-up speed . Earthlink and NetZero already offer free accelerators as part of their service ; America Online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AOL Time Warner ) will add one when it launches AOL 9 later this summer . Basically , accelerators add a software layer on top of your browser that compresses data and saves Web pages in a format that lets you surf at up to three times the speed of regular dial-up . That 's not a huge improvement , but at least it gets you a little way into the toy store .  --  By Chris Taylor
