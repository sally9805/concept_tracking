Just in time for the highest gas prices in more than 20 years , DaimlerChrysler , Ford and General Motors unveil their high-mileage cars for a new era . Photograph FORD PRODIGY Photograph GM PRECEPT Photograph DODGE ESX3 // Winter 's run-up in fuel prices served as an unmistakable reminder that there 's no constitutional guarantee to cheap and plentiful oil . Though America 's pump prices probably wo n't reach the European levels of $4 to $5 a gallon anytime soon , it 's unlikely we 'll return to the era of $1-agallon gasoline , either . That may be bad news for drivers , but it 's giving new momentum to a groundbreaking program dubbed the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles ( PNGV ) . President Clinton laid down the gauntlet for this industry/ government consortium seven years ago , when he called on the Big Three automakers to triple the mileage of the typical U.S. family sedan . Even with a federal commitment of about $200 million a year , much of it in the form of research programs at Sandia National Laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was immediately obvious that the president had issued a tough challenge . Coming under increasing public and government pressure , automakers around the world have been struggling to improve fuel economy . In Europe , the industry 's goal is to bring to market vehicles that can get the equivalent of 78 mpg . But the first products to meet that target , such as the 3.0-liter Volkswagen Lupo , are small , stripped and expensive . " People want us to produce moonshot technology at down-to-earth prices , " says DaimlerChrysler president Jim Holden . " Consumers wo n't accept any car that does n't meet their expectations for utility , for performance , for roominess and for affordability . " So a central tenet of PNGV , also known as the " supercar " program , has been to deliver " 3X " mileage without any sacrifice . The program 's Holy Grail is an 80-mpg car the size of the popular Ford Taurus that 's also safe , clean and affordable . " Quite frankly , a lot of us doubted this partnership would work , " admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has worked , and extremely well . " The proof is in the form of three new PNGV prototype vehicles , the GM Precept , the Ford Prodigy and DaimlerChrysler 's Dodge ESX3 . Do n't go looking for them at your local dealer , at least not yet . Their production is still years away . But in the very near future , bits and pieces of all of this technology should show up on more mundane vehicles . The PNGV is a " precompetitive " program . In lay terms , that means industry and government researchers worked to develop basic , common goals and guidelines , but once they chose the fundamentals most likely to meet the 3X goal , it was up to each automaker to design a buildable prototype . In the initial process , the partners explored a vast array of technologies , with a concerted focus on advanced powertrains . They looked at everything from the Sterling engine to direct-injection gasoline engines . In the end , a hybrid solution won out . All three PNGV prototypes are driven by a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they show surprisingly divergent strategies . GM Precept General Motors ' Precept is arguably the most advanced of the three supercars . Precept mates a 1.3-liter direct-injection diesel with two electric motors , one on each axle . It 's the only " heavy " hybrid , meaning it can run on diesel power , electric or a combination of the two . Approximately two-thirds of the time during urban driving conditions , Precept is powered solely by its 35-kilowatt lithium polymer battery pack . The electric motors also serve as " electric superchargers , " increasing performance on takeoff , or when pulling a heavy load . Unlike GM 's EVl battery car , you do n't need to plug Precept into an electric outlet . The diesel engine can serve as a charger , and additional power is recaptured by the motor during regenerative braking. // GM PRECEPT Photograph All the carmakers are still working to develop affordable fuel cells like this one for the next generation of cars . // GM bills Precept 's body as the most aerodynamic ever designed . To cheat the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Precept even replaces conventional sideview mirrors with " lipstick cameras " - the captured images are viewed on two dashboard-mounted displays . The chassis and body make extensive use of lightweight aluminum , magnesium , composites and titanium , helping hold total weight to 2618 pounds , half that of many SUVs , and two-thirds the weight of the target Taurus . Ford Prodigy The Ford Prodigy is also highly aerodynamic . And it makes use of aluminum and other lightweight materials . Unlike GM 's supercar , Prodigy is a " light " hybrid in which the diesel engine always drives the car . There 's only a single , 47-hp electric motor , which assists the 1.2liter direct-injection diesel during takeoff and hard acceleration . But that combination lets Prodigy get by with an engine that 's half the size that you 'd expect in a more conventional sedan . Ford predicts that , like Precept , Prodigy will get at least 80 mpg under normal driving conditions . ( Actually , both get a bit better economy using diesel , but that figure has been converted to equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Dodge ESX3 ESX , 3 is the third in a series of highmileage prototypes developed by Chrysler Corp. , now DaimlerChrysler AG . It 's the most conventional looking of the three PNGV prototypes , and the roomiest . At 72 mpg , it 's the only one falling short of PNGV 's mileage target , but , ironically , that may make it the most realistic of the three supercars . ESX3 is another light hybrid , using lithiumion batteries to provide energy for short bursts of acceleration . And the electric motor allows for so-called Start/Stop operation . At a red light or when idling in heavy traffic , the diesel engine shuts off . When it 's time to move again , a tap on the accelerator pedal automatically starts the engine , with the electric motor acting as the starter . DaimlerChrysler engineers opted to avoid costly aluminum and magnesium . ESX3 's body consists of a dozen pieces of injectionmolded plastic , similar to the material used for soda pop bottles . The prototype sports a glossy paint job , but it could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would eliminate the need for a paint shop , reducing production costs . Engineers worked hard to keep costs under control . Instead of the GM Precept 's side-mounted cameras , ESX3 uses a lower-priced prism system , much like that of a submarine periscope . At volumes of 80,000 units a year , it would still cost $7500 more to build an ESX3 than a midsize Chrysler Concorde . But the penalty on the original ESX was $60,000 and on the ESX2 , it was $15,000 , so the trend is right . Not Here Yet While Ford and GM would n't set down figures , observers suggest Prodigy and Precept would likely cost several times more than a conventional sedan , unless and until the automakers can achieve major breakthroughs in such things as assembly techniques and battery-manufacturing methods . Photograph Prime motive power for the Dodge ESX3 comes from a small diesel engine . This is backed by a lithium-ion electric that starts the diesel at each stop and provides boost for acceleration . // While the technology is falling into place , PNGV 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added $25 to $50 a month to the typical family 's fuel bill . That makes motorists more interested in economy , but , even so , the equation is lopsided . Tripling the mileage of the average American family sedan would save about 371 gal . of fuel annually . Even at $2 a gallon , that would barely be $750 in savings a year . So the cost gap needs to get a lot closer , though a proposed $3000 federal tax credit for high-mileage cars would help . There 's another challenge facing PNGV . The three vehicles all meet current , Tier I emissions standards , but not the toughened Tier II rules soon to go into effect . Diesel particulates , linked by some research to lung cancer , pose an especially tough challenge . Improved emissions devices are under development , but they would require at least a tenfold reduction in the amount of sulfur currently found in American diesel fuels , which can run upward of 500 parts per million . The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to set new diesel fuel standards later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pieces of the PNGV technology could begin showing up at your local dealer in just a couple years , hints DaimlerChrysler 's Holden . One of the first examples could be in a modified version of the German-American automaker 's Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle . Dubbed a " through-the-road hybrid , " it would replace its gashungry VS with a more miserly V6 . That engine drives the rear wheels , while an electric motor drives the front axle . Able to generate 175 hp in short bursts , a prototype actually achieves better 0-to-60-mph times than a conventional Durango with Dodge 's big 5.9-liter V8 , but it gets 20 percent better fuel economy . The domestic automakers are n't the only ones looking at hybrids for big gains in fuel economy . Toyota put the world 's first dual-powertrain automobile , the still not EPA-rated Prius , into production more than a year ago . A U.S. version is due to debut this year . And last fall , Honda unveiled the Insight , rated by the EPA at 65 combined mpg . But both have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conventional family sedan , and Insight is only a two-Beater , limiting its potential market in the United States to an estimated 4000 a year . Both automakers hint they have more mainstream models under development . The bottom line , GM 's Pearce emphasized , is that new technology will come to market . " The vehicles of the future will be as different from today 's vehicles as the first automobile was from the horse and buggy .
