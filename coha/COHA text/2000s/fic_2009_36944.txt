THERE ON THE DAMP pine needles , Kirsten Young lay on her back , a serene Ophelia in her dusky pond of blood . The dark irises of her bloodshot eyes stared unseeing into the branches above her . The sun had burst through the clouds after the sudden downpour and now blazed above the canopy of conifers and aspens in Provo Canyon . Deep in its recesses , the light filtered down in vertical sheets of champagne dust that played across the body . <p> Her skin , once the faintest of olive , now was pale as churned cream , mottled in the dark pooling of what everyone called her hot Italian blood . An angry oral bruise , dark as a plum , marked the side of her forehead . <p> The slit in her throat cut deep . Her left arm lay loosely at her side , still bearing at the wrist the friction marks from the plastic rope that had bound her . Her right arm crossed her chest , with the elbow supported by a rock underneath the triceps so the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own shoulder , as if she gave herself a final hug in death . The tip of her thumb touched , delicately , the edge of the open wound under her left ear . <p> The scene on the forest floor was meant to set things aright . <p> No , no , she was n't Ophelia at all , he thought . She was Eve , temptress and sinner cast from the garden of Utah , wearing a hasty apron of cottonwood leaves heaped around and across her plump belly , from just below the navel to mid-thigh . Tiny rivulets of blood snaked down through the leaves . <p> The other four wounds , the little ones , were postmortem , made after she 'd already bled out . <p> On the right side of her chest , incised with surgical precision , the first cut penetrated deep , a backward L. It depicted a carpenter 's square : the straightedge , true-maker , indispensable for right angles . The desired angularity could not , alas , be achieved on the soft roundness of this still-warm flesh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left side , a chevron gaped open with edges that wanted to lose their definition , a tiny V on this day of defeats and victories . <p> A third inch-long slit carefully cut into the muscle just above the knee that would never again bow . <p> A final slit traversed her stomach just above the navel , a sign of nourishment for a body that would never again eat ; of health for one who would only decay . <p> They were all symbols only the initiated would understand . But below her navel mark , Kirsten harbored her own tiny secret , one that held the seed of her killer 's downfall , her own unwitting fleshly vengeance . <p> In the sheeting light , her murderer stood above her like the angel guarding Eden , the knife-sword flashing this way and that in his gloved hand . He had brought along a plain white sheet he 'd bought at a garage sale and kept stored in a plastic bag . But he changed his mind about putting it over her . She was beyond the veil now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leaves embroidered on the green cloth apron he wore were speckled as a measles plant . The X-Acto knife lay at his feet and he picked it up and threw it and the sheet into the stream . Then he laid the note carefully on the ground , its edge secured by a rock . <p> The white cap still contained his close-cropped hair but it had lost its starched definition . It , too , sagged as he backed away from Kirsten , brushing over with a fallen pine branch the near-invisible footprints they both had made when they came to this , his sacred grove . <p> His breathing was heavy as he recited . They 'd said it was " the pure Adamic language " he 'd learned that first time , at age nineteen , scared half to death by all the temple vows and disembodied voices behind the veils : <p> " Pay lay ale . Pay lay ale . Pay lay ale . " <p> He swallowed hard . <p> " Oh Lord , hear the words of my mouth . " <p> Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone thought was the first murder victim , found her quite by chance : He nearly tripped over the body after stumbling through the underbrush seeking a secluded place to relieve himself . <p> Terrance Jensen , Dr. Jensen to his students but Terry to his family , jogged every day now , after his doctor told him that the stress of holding too much inside was going to kill him . Jensen had squelched a retort-how would you like the faith of 12.8 million followers on your shoulders , he 'd wanted to ask-and thanked the doctor meekly for the free pedometer . <p> Always one to take such a warning from an authority figure most literally , Jensen dutifully took up running to reduce his thickening waist and his stress level , and found that as his stamina increased , so did his enjoyment . But reticent by nature , he would drive miles from his off-campus home to the new trails in the mountains northeast of Provo to run in solitude , this place where he could jog and talk to himself without anyone commenting . <p> Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cola drink-forbidden on the Brigham Young University campus-had been what had made his bladder so urgent that he 'd had to veer off the rain-slicked path . On other runs he 'd occasionally encountered other hikers and runners , so he had to be careful . When he caught sight of what could have been a police car on the distant winding road , he hid even from that . <p> His mind tangled into the greatest dilemma of his life . With what elegance of speech and imagination , he wondered , can you extract fifteen words out of one Egyptian hieroglyphic , fifteen words that have nothing to do with the hieroglyphic itself . Mnemonics ? He snorted . Even he could n't believe that . And how do you sell such a translation technique for scripture to an increasingly literate group , with access to the Internet ? Everyone was depending on him , the Church 's foremost Egyptologist , to hold the line , to keep saying that these ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics could be finessed into saying what they did not say . <p> He was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aching and his blood chanting in his ears . <p> Then he saw her . <p> He did n't dare come near-the woman was obviously dead . But the folded piece of paper under the rock-surely , he thought , he could look at that and put it back before anyone could get here . No harm would be done . He hesitated and dialed 911 , only mildly surprised when the dispatcher recognized his name and took down the facts as he dispassionately related them : female , certainly dead , trail location ; and yes , he 'd wait . <p> Jensen looked around for a stick but thought better of leaving fingerprints , so he took his water bottle out of his fanny pack and used it to push the rock off the piece of paper . On the outside was written in a small , neat hand the words " THE SECOND PROOF . " Using his car keys , he coaxed the edges apart and unfolded it . It was written in a code that any student of Mormon history would have recognized at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp it . He read it over twice , the color draining from his pinched face . Then he stepped closer and looked at the dead woman . Anyone who lived in Salt Lake City and watched the news or read a local paper knew Kirsten Young . Any one of the millions of Mormons who wore temple garments under their clothes would know what the cuts on her meant . <p> And anyone who could read the Deseret Alphabet , taught to schoolchildren in Utah during the 1860s when Brigham Young 's word was law , would know the connection between Kirsten Young 's pitiful body and the note he held in his hand . <p> One thing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did n't need right now was bad publicity , and Jensen knew that the media would alight soon after the police . Whom to tell about the note ? He first resolved to look for the raised ridges of the peculiar neckline of temple garments beneath the uniforms of policemen identifying which were brother Mormons . <p> But he changed his mind . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note , at least for a while . He 'd be protecting it . He 'd be protecting everyone . He put the note into his fanny pack , having squeezed it into the little wallet full of gas receipts and gum wrappers , and walked back to the trail to meet them all . <p> Chapter Three TOO EARLY FOR lightning bugs but not yet cooled down , the west Tennessee evening held in its breath a promise of more moist , stifling air . A sullen breeze pestered the drooping tomato vines , bringing with it the green smell of their leaves , but no relief to the shaded porch on the east side of the old house with the white siding . <p> Brushing her dark blonde hair back from her damp forehead , Selonnah Zee stared into her lap at the blue-granite dishpan whose chipped interior held the purple-hull peas that had so stained her fingers . It would be days until she could get the stain out ; and no use trying to explain the subtle ( and defended-to-the-death ) differences between them and field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stain and another would not when they all looked pretty much the same once cooked . She would scrub and scrub and still need to invent a story about an accident with a printer ink cartridge . Anyone could relate to that . <p> " Enough snap beans here for a mess too . " Her mother 's voice startled Selonnah . The bent woman carried another old pan on her hip , this one grey granite full of green beans . She sat down into the old metal chair with a sudden dismissal of her muscles and began snapping the beans . Each rubbery green tube made soft sounds like young boys popping their knuckles before a brawl . <p> Selonnah stood and stretched . " I need to go . " She 'd told her mother , Mary , the same thing several rimes in the last hour , and she 'd said she understood . May-ree . That 's how her mother said her first name . She 'd told May-ree she had to go . But here they were , beginning the same farewell conversation again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Selonnah looked at her mother 's weathered mudslide of a face , with its rising pout of protest , and wondered if her mother really was so lonely she would so shamelessly , repeatedly ask Selonnah to stay longer . Then Selonnah 's best friend , Guilt Everpresent , like a shawl of weight on her shoulders , stopped her . <p> Her mother murmured . " Darlin ' , I know , but you fixin ' to leave ... do n't hardly never see you no more ... just let me get a bag , put these beans and peas in , just hold your horses and I 'll be right back .... " <p> Selonnah 's cell phone buzzed her side like a wasp in her waistband . " Selonnah here . " <p> It was Selonnah 's boss and editor , Deborah Wiley , on the phone , her voice another insistent buzzing . Deborah had little patience with Selonnah , and it showed each time they talked . Selonnah knew she wondered why her reporter had gone all the way through a criminal justice degree-and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism so as to then start at the bottom at a struggling metropolitan newspaper . A girl cop who became a reporter did n't make sense to anyone , even to Selonnah . <p> " Hey , Selonnah . When do you actually fly out to Utah ? " <p> Deborah 's voice and words revealed her resentment of the fact that Selonnah was taking the two-week vacation she 'd earned after working more than a year at the newspaper , the Memphis Telegraph . No doubt she 'd earned her stripes , and Selonnah could dress well and knew which fork was for salad . Yet despite her background in law enforcement , she was assigned pretty-girl stories . Writing for the lifestyles section of a Southern newspaper could mean covering anything from the Junior League to women farmers , now that they 'd gotten rid of anything that smelled like a society column . Today it meant architecture . <p> " Look , they 're building a new Mormon temple out in Germantown , " Deborah began , referring to the east Memphis area exploding with growth . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this when I get back-what am I saying ? I have n't even left . I 'm here in Alamo checking on my more before I fly out tomorrow . " <p> Deborah upped her curtness . " We 'll pay you extra . For a big feature you can research while you 're in Utah . This new temple is raising a lot of hackles . Very futuristic .... " <p> Nearby , her mother 's murmuring became part of the conversation , no matter how hard Selonnah tried to exclude its familiar rhythms . " Inside out and ringside rumpus and holes in the bottom to boot . Plastic bags worthless in the grocery store , worthless here at home , worthless as a paper shirt in a fight . Hellacious . " <p> " ... and we want you to do a big piece on the history and architecture of these temples . Kind of give people some background . And people are curious after all the fallout about Mitt Romney and the raid on the polygamists ' compound in Texas . Let readers see that the temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they all have in common . And why they 're so secretive . " Selonnah hesitated . <p> " We 'll reimburse your airfare . " <p> Selonnah stayed silent . <p> " And any meals when interviewing . " <p> That settled it . Deborah got the details out of the way-word count , areas of emphasis for the features . Selonnah hung up and returned her attention to her mother . <p> " Mom , anything you want me to tell Roger ? " <p> Roger Zee was Selonnah 's cousin , the white sheep of a black sheep family , small-town boy unfleeced by the big city . With good looks and lucky breaks , he had smiled his way from weekend weatherman in Jackson , Tennessee , to high-profile features reporter for CBS , shedding everything extraneous from his drawl to his wife as he went along . When he 'd been assigned to cover the Salt Lake City Olympics , all of Crockett County , Tennessee-and especially his hometown , Alamo-claimed him as native son and scion of success . But he 'd inexplicably given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympics , marrying a standoffish Native American woman whom nobody in Tennessee could see much in . Then he started teaching at a university . <p> " Roger . " Her mother sighed . " Some folks ai n't likely to forget that stunt he pulled last time he come home , going back to the Primitive Baptist Church and offerin ' to preach when Brother Hensley was sick . " <p> " Stunt ? How was that a stunt ? " <p> " He got up there big as daylight with what ever'body thought was a Bible and said , ' The scriptures say this , ' and ' the good book says that , ' and ' it reads right here , ' and folks sayin ' to him , ' ai n't nobody could ever preach like you did , wisht you was comin ' back here all the time , ' and pleased as punch till they found out he 's turned Mormon and was teachin ' out of that Mormon bible the whole time and ai n't nobody knowin ' diddlysquat difference , a-tall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued on . " Served ' em all right anyways . Footwashers . " <p> " I do n't know about all that . That must have happened when I was away at school . And why would it matter anyway , what book he preached out of ? " Selonnah lost touch with the Tennessee mind-set when she attended the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque , living there with her father before he had died . Besides , her branch of the family had been more religious observers than practitioners , and theological niceties were a foreign language to her . <p> " I 'm just looking forward to seeing Roger and Eliza and little Maria , and having some downtime , " Selonnah said , returning to the subject at hand . " That phone call I just got- " Selonnah stopped at the same puzzled look from her mother she 'd seen so often lately . Could Mary have missed what just happened ? <p> Taking a deep breath , Selonnah repeated , " That phone call means that I 'll actually get paid for doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger 's . He can help me out with things . " <p> Her brother , Frank , lived close by and hovered over their room . Selonnah knew he would check in daily . Nothing more she could volunteer , really . " And if you need me , you can get me on my cell . " <p> Resigned , her mother handed her a brown market sack filled with triple-tied plastic bags of green beans , greens , butterbeans , and the purple-hulls . Selonnah knew better than to remind her mother she was leaving in the morning . She 'd eat all she could before she left for the airport at noon and freeze the rest . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
