<p> ORCHARD PARK , N.Y .  --  Chidi Ahanotu lives in midtown Toronto and works in suburban Buffalo . He travels two hours or more each way every day , ferried in a stretch limousine along the Queen Elizabeth Way as it gently bends around Lake Ontario . <p> His is a tale of two cities , two countries , one border  --  and one heck of a commute . That tale is unusual in the annals of the NFL , yet seems about right for the veteran defensive end , whose life has entry points across the globe . <p> Ahanotu is in his first season with the Buffalo Bills . Most of his teammates live here in Orchard Park or one of the other suburbs south of Buffalo . Their trips to work are measured in minutes , not miles . Ahanotu 's gets measured in hours  --  and kilometers . <p> " Round trip is 500K exactly , " says Canadian Mark Cameron , Ahanotu 's limousine driver . " I 'm not sure how that converts . " <p> Figure on 310 miles a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and that 's roughly 1,860 weekly miles  --  plus a dozen border crossings . And you thought you had a tough commute . <p> Ahanotu insists his is n't as tough as it seems . Cameron does the driving . Ahanotu mostly sleeps . And the payoff is he gets to live outside the country , which he always has wanted to do , in a city that never sleeps , Ontario version . <p> " I have always wanted to experience life in another country , " Ahanotu says . " So I said , ' Well , if I 'm in Buffalo I 'm too close not to do it . ' " <p> Chidi Ahanotu ( CHEE-dee uh-HAHN-uh-too ) attended high school and college in Berkeley , Calif . He played eight NFL seasons in Tampa and one in St. Louis before the Bills signed him as a free agent in August to shore up their defensive line . That 's when Ahanotu , 32 , began to wonder about living in the Great White North . <p> " I wanted to see how life is outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes we think this is the best way , or the only way , to live . No other way can be good . " <p> He is finding life in Toronto can be very good , with its international feel , its vibrancy in the arts , its diverse cultures . <p> " I 'm Nigerian , and the African presence in Toronto is huge , " says Ahanotu , born in Modesto , Calif . " Everywhere I turn there is someone from Egypt or Somalia . Just being around those people feels good . My father is from Nigeria , and I 've been to Nigeria twice . It 's really a deep-rooted thing inside of me . I really identify with that . " <p> Ahanotu wants his children to identify with it , too . His boys  --  Ijechi , 5 , and Mayan , 3  --  and their mother live with him in Toronto . " My lady is Honduran , and the Latin culture is in Toronto , too . " <p> Their primary home is in Miami ; he says selling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told them it snowed there , they were like , ' Oh , yeah ! ' " <p> Harsh winter weather a concern <p> Kids love snow ; commuters do n't . That could pose a problem in the weeks ahead . Last winter , Buffalo got 7 feet of snow Christmas week . Lesser amounts will pile up this winter . Count on it . That 's one reason guard Ruben Brown lives here in Orchard Park , just blocks from Ralph Wilson Stadium . <p> " I like Orchard Park , and I like being five minutes away , " Brown says . " We get a lot of weather around here . I hope that 's not going to be hard for Chidi . " <p> Ahanotu already has thought about that . He has recently begun staying at a hotel in downtown Buffalo after long days , about once a week . Once the snow flies , he expects he 'll have to stay downtown more often . <p> Ahanotu is chatting on his cellphone as Cameron drives up to the Canadian Customs booth at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontario . Ahanotu quickly says goodbye to the NFL 's Jay Sweeney and snaps the phone shut : " If you 're on your cellphone , they hate that . " <p> Customs officials have pulled him over for additional questioning a few times when he was on his phone ; he does n't get pulled over much anymore . <p> " In the beginning I got the ninth degree , which is their job , " Ahanotu says . " But now they 're getting to know me . They ask Mark , ' Is Chidi back there ? ' They give me pats on the back . Or they give me a hard time : ' You did n't get any sacks . ' We have some laughs . " <p> As Cameron pulls away from customs , with the wide sweep of the Queen Elizabeth Way ahead , Ahanotu returns the call to Sweeney , manager of events and fan development for NFL Canada . Sweeney wants to know where to leave front-row tickets for that night 's Toronto Raptors NBA game . <p> " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a dozen Canadians who play in the NFL , but I 'm not aware of any NFL players who live in Canada during the season . And I 'm not aware of any Raptors or Maple Leafs who live in the States " in-season . <p> Ahanotu continues to pay U.S. taxes . Americans who work in the USA and live in Canada for fewer than 183 days a year typically do not incur Canadian taxes , according to Carey Singer , tax partner at Mintz &; Partners , a Toronto-based accounting firm . Sweeney asks Ahanotu to make appearances for NFL Canada , such as one at a high school football practice Thursday . <p> " I 'm like a commodity in Toronto , " Ahanotu says . " I 'm the only Buffalo Bill who 's there , and the Bills have a lot of fans " in southern Ontario . <p> How do fans in western New York feel about a guy who would rather commute four hours a day than live among them ? <p> " It seems a little quirky , " season ticketholder John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-issue . " <p> Ahanotu says Bills fans tell him they like Toronto , too . <p> " I think they think it 's cool , " he says . " This is nothing bad against Buffalo . Toronto has more things to do . Buffalo has great fans . That 's one reason I wanted to come here . This is a real football town . " <p> Ahanotu had a sack in each of his first three games , a Bills first . He has 35 tackles , four sacks and 15 quarterback pressures this season . Bills coach Gregg Williams is happy with that . <p> " He has been a very refreshing addition to our team , " Williams says . " He is an organized guy , and he takes care of business . He deems it best for his family to live in Toronto , and I support that , no questions asked . " <p> Quarterback Drew Bledsoe took his wife to Toronto last week , when the Bills had a bye . They saw a play , went out to dinner  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm telling you , I do n't know how he does that . That 's a long drive , " Bledsoe says . " Everybody tells you it 's an hour and a half . I do n't know how fast they 're driving , but it took us a while , and I drive pretty fast . " <p> Day starts with 5 a.m. pickup <p> It is 90 minutes from the Peace Bridge to the Toronto city limits but longer from door to door . Cameron picks up Ahanotu at 5 most mornings , and it takes two hours to get to the stadium . Inserts in the back convert the limo into a mobile queen-sized bed , and Ahanotu sleeps almost all the way . <p> The return trip , which starts in late afternoon or early evening , takes more than two hours , depending on traffic on the Peace Bridge and in Toronto . Ahanotu can watch TV , use a wireless Internet hookup or listen to satellite radio . Mostly he sleeps or chats with Cameron , now a friend as much as his driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,373 U.S. ) as a monthly rate for limo service . That 's more than he pays for his midtown apartment , which costs $ 6,600 Canadian a month ( about $ 4,206 U.S. ) . It used to be home for Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Raul Mondesi , until he was traded to the New York Yankees in July . <p> " Chidi is different , " says Bills tight end Dave Moore , who also played with Ahanotu in Tampa . " When the guys told me he was going to live in Toronto , I told them it 's a typical Chidi move . There are certain things in life he 's looking for , and he 's willing to travel to get them . " <p> Ahanotu figures he has the best of both worlds : He plays in Buffalo , a city parochial enough to have football as a consuming passion , and lives in Toronto , a city international enough to suit his eclectic tastes . <p> " My teammates think I 'm crazy , " he says . " But , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home and they 're sitting on the couch flipping channels or playing video games . So , hey , it 's not like I 'm losing valuable time . <p> " I know I 'm different . To me , this thing is like no big deal . "
