Tod Raphaely was flying high four years ago when he was named European sales manager for Raltron Electronics and saw his salary rise to $115,000 a year . Raphaely , now 43 , remained upbeat when the tech bubble began to leak air and he was reassigned to the Miami headquarters of the manufacturer of computer and cell-phone parts . He and his wife Wendy bought a condo and renovated the kitchen . He did n't panic when he and several other Raltron employees had their pay cut 10% in the fall of 2001 and another 10% the following spring . " We were hoping things would get better , " Tod says . " So we continued to trudge on . " But last fall Raltron slashed wages a third time  --  by more than 20% in Tod 's case . He now makes $70,000 a year even though he has taken on additional duties . He and Wendy have cut household spending , but their credit-card debt  --  and their anxiety  --  is soaring . Tod says he is grateful just to have a regular paycheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working Americans are now facing a less familiar and perhaps more troubling problem : shrinking wages . It 's a phenomenon that takes many forms . Some workers , like Raphaely , have had to swallow outright pay cuts . Others have lost their jobs and , in the tough labor market of today , have had to settle for new ones at less pay . Still others  --  including employees at such giants as AT &T,; Boise Cascade and Starwood Hotels  --  have had to accept pay freezes that , when rising prices are factored in , amount to reduced compensation . To add insult to injury , companies everywhere are reducing bonuses and overtime and eroding health and pension benefits . <P> The numbers are grim . For the 500,000 workers laid off since January , the average job search has stretched to a 19-year high of nearly five months  --  about twice the duration of the typical severance package . According to outplacement firm Challenger , Gray &; Christmas , 17% of those who do find work  --  nearly double the historical percentage  --  are settling for less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay : in the first three months of 2003 , median weekly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 1.5% , according to the U.S. Labor Department . That 's the biggest drop since 1991 , according to Jared Bernstein , an economist at the Economic Policy Institute , a research group based in Washington . Wage erosion partly explains why the Federal Reserve Board openly frets about the threat of deflation , a downward spiral in prices that can cripple an economy by making debt repayment more difficult and encouraging consumers to wait for even lower prices . Adding fuel to the deflation debate , the cost of goods to both consumers and manufacturers fell in April , officials reported last week . <P> The no-raise economy is partly a predictable , temporary aftershock from the burst Internet bubble and recession . With core inflation ( excluding food and energy ) officially running at just 1.5% , workers are relatively well equipped to cope with stingy employers  --  particularly in an era of 0% auto financing and mortgage rates that last week dropped yet again to historic lows . Dramatically declining energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing consumers to keep more of what they earn .
