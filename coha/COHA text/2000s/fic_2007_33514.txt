Judy Moody Declares Independence By Megan McDonald Candlewick Megan McDonald When Judy got home , she dragged her tote bag upstairs to her room . Thwump , thwump , thwump . She dragged her backpack , her blanket , her pillow , and her sock monkey . And her stuff from the gift shop . She shut the door and climbed up into her secret hideaway ( her top bunk ) . She , Judy Moody , was supposed to be writing her makeup book report , as in not waiting till the very , very last minute . Instead , she declared freedom from homework . Then she , Judy Moody , had an idea . A freedom idea . A John Hancock idea . A Declaration of Independence idea . She did not even stop to call Rocky and tell him about the Boston Tea Party Ship and the Giant Milk Bottle that sold star-spangled bananas . She did not even stop to call Frank and tell him about Mother Goose 's grave and the musical toilet . That could wait till tomorrow . But some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copy of the Declaration of Independence she 'd gotten in Boston . It was on old-timey brown paper with burned edges that looked like tea had been spilled on it . Judy squinted to try to read the fancy-schmancy handwriting . When in the bones of human events . . . blah blah blah . . . we hold these truths . . . more blah blah . . . alien rights . . . Life , Liberty , and the Purse of Happiness . She , Judy Moody , would hereby , this day , make the Judy Moody Declaration of Independence . With alien rightsand her own Purse of Happiness and everything .
