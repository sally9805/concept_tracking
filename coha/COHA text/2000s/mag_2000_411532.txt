Many years ago , when Victoria was Queen of England , it was acceptable for women to learn a lot , but they were not supposed to do any kind of work outside the home . People thought a woman should get married , stay at home , and drink tea . Florence Nightingale grew up in England during those times , but she was a rebel . Florence Nightingale wanted to live her life in her own way , and she worked hard to get the things she wanted . Today , we are lucky that this woman was so strong-minded and independent . Miss Nightingale was born in 1820 , and she went to school to learn how to behave like a " proper " lady . She was bored with sitting around the house , however , and she told her parents she wanted to do more with her life . Her parents were shocked because they thought she should just find a husband and get married . Florence Nightingale did not want a husband , she said ; she wanted to become a nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days women who were nurses were usually very ignorant , dirty , and unpleasant . Helping doctors was thought to be one of the worst jobs , and it was certainly not a job for a Victorian lady . But Florence Nightingale was no ordinary Victorian lady ; she was a determined woman . Mrs. Nightingale thought her daughter would change her mind if she went on a vacation . When Florence was nearly thirty years old , her mother persuaded her to travel to Paris with her and her sister . As soon as she could , Florence Nightingale stole away and went to a place where some Catholic nuns were training young women to take care of the poor and sick . Miss Nightingale grew even more certain that she wanted to be a nurse . Soon she heard about a German minister who was training women who had been in prison to be nurses . She traveled to the minister 's home in Germany to see what she could learn from him . When she returned to England , Florence Nightingale got a job as the superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to work as nurses , but they would n't do it . They still thought nursing was a job that only poor women would do . People thought Florence Nightingale was strange , and they did n't think her ideas about nursing were very good . Many people laughed at her behind her back . She did n't let those things bother her ; she knew that she was right about the things she believed in . Before long , England was involved in the Crimean War , a war that took place in Turkey from 1853 to 1856 . Like all wars , the Crimean War was vicious , and many soldiers were killed , and thousands were badly wounded . In the part of Turkey where the battles were , there were no hospitals and almost no doctors . When reporters wrote in the newspaper about the wounded soldiers who had to lie around on the ground , Florence Nightingale felt that she had to help . She convinced thirty-eight nurse friends to go to Turkey with her . The English government was glad that she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling her the " Superintendent of the Nursing Staff in the East . " She soon discovered that a long job title was all she had . There were few bandages , not very much medicine , and only an old building that was falling down that could be used as a hospital . The wounded soldiers lay on cots , using old canvas for sheets.The hospital windows were nailed shut , and under the wooden floor there was an open sewer that was full of rats and that had a foul smell . There was no place to wash the soldiers ' clothes and no kitchen in which to prepare food . But Florence Nightingale was determined to take care of the sick and wounded . She argued and argued with the generals , insisting that she get the things she needed . Before long , her determination paid off . She got the bandages and medicine she needed . She and her nurses cleaned up the hospital . They painted the building and opened the windows . They built a laundry , and before long she had talked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This new battlefield hospital was n't big , but it was comfortable and clean . The soldiers knew how hard she was working to help them , and because of her efforts they loved her a lot . It seemed to those men that Florence Nightingale never slept . Day and night she would walk around the hospital . She would bandage wounds , give the men medicine , help them write letters home , and talk to them . They thought she was like an angel . When the soldiers wrote home to their friends and families , they wrote about the " lady with the lamp : " They called her Miss Nightingale because at night she would carry a lantern as she checked on the resting soldiers . It is said that the soldiers appreciated her so much that they kissed her shadow as it passed by them . To the soldiers , Florence Nightingale was an angel , but to the officers and the government people , she was a bother . She believed it was her duty to see that her patients got the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not take no for an answer . The officers and government people thought women should be weak and timid and do what men said . Like her parents , these men were shocked by Florence Nightingale , but nothing they did could make her change her mind . // Because she was so determined , she was able to save many lives during the Crimean War . But this great woman 's work did not end with the war . // Because the reporters and soldiers talked about the " lady with the lamp , " everyone in England soon knew about Florence Nightingale and her nurses . When she returned to England , she was very , very famous . Everyone wanted to hear her talk about the war and her nurses . As they listened , they began to think that maybe it was all right for a woman to be a nurse , that maybe being a nurse was a good job after all . Before , people had laughed at her ideas , but now they wanted to give her money so she could teach more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School and Home for Nurses at St.Thomas Hospital in London . In a few years , hospitals all over Europe and in America wanted to hire these new-style nurses . Florence Nightingale still worked day and night , training people to be nurses , teaching people about health , and trying to improve hospitals . Unfortunately , she had worked so hard for so long that her health suffered ; for many years she used a wheelchair in which to move around . When she was eighty-seven , three years before she died , Florence Nightingale became the first woman to be given a special award by the British government . The award was called the " British Order of Merit " Later , after she died , a statue of her was erected in London . Before then , the only women in England who had statues were queens and princesses . The statue was made to help people remember Florence Nightingale 's hard work and dedication to others . She was an inspiration to men and women alike . It is said that people who met her never forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
