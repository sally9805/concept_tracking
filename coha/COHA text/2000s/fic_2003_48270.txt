My aunt Leticia could be counted on to explain the family mysteries . She 'd forget I did n't know something and drop it into conversation , or use the occasion of having a fever-or being ill in any way-to let down her defenses and tell me things I had n't been told . Sometimes the words flew out of her mouth like frogs jumping onto the road after a rainstorm . <p> She was never the heroine of the stories . Neither was Beaumont , her husband . Infrequently , a dog was the hero . She had two dogs : one a collie , the last one a mutt from the pound who could not be cured of sniffing under women 's skirts , who died after being struck by a go-cart . A little monster who was visiting his aunt and uncle hit it . The young man buried it twice , once in the field across from Leticia and Beaumont 's house , and again the next day , after Leticia rethought the final resting place . <p> I liked the first dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dog who 'd been run over . Tyke had lived to be thirteen , which I think is ninety-one in human years : exactly the age Leticia was when she died . <p> I used to visit my aunt and uncle for two weeks during the summer . I was driven there by my parents , who were divorced , though they got together to do things with me on significant days , such as my birthday , and once or twice I remember trick-or-treating with them on Halloween . They attended all graduations and more musical performances than necessary . They no doubt gave thanks that I never played sports . <p> I always loved to work in a garden , though . Now I grow herbs , along with some Better Boy tomatoes I 've staked in a washtub I leave on the front stoop so the deer wo n't eat them . Around the lantern at the end of the walkway are sweet peas , in with the morning glories , and so far no animals have sniffed them out . <p> Going to visit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother did not approve of my father 's family , but she knew how much the Maine vacation meant to me . I started thinking about it at Christmas , which helped me get through winter in Cleveland . Leticia and Beaumont were nothing like their names : she was n't prim and proper at all-in fact , she guffawed instead of laughing-and although you might assume Beaumont was a Southerner , he was from a tiny mining village in Michigan . He was six feet tall , and his scowl was deeply etched below and above his eyes . He was self-conscious when he laughed along with his wife . Did I think Beaumont was always a lot of fun ? Well , he most surely was n't , but that was due to the terrible death-grip alcohol got on him after he was fired from his factory job , Leticia told me , when she was in the hospital recovering from pneumonia . <p> This was the routine : my pajamas were kept from year to year and placed on the bed as if I 'd just slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrew them ( Leticia queried my mother before my arrival ) . I was sent a catalogue of flower seeds in March , from which I could pick a dozen different kinds to be planted in the garden that spring . Uncle B. would write a letter in which he enclosed " gas money " to pass on to my parents , who always protested but ended up saying , " Well , we do n't want to put her in the middle , so just this once , we 'll take it . " My father did all the driving from Cleveland to Maine . We stayed at a Howard Johnson 's , where we ordered fried clam dinners and mint ice cream for dessert . My mother and I slept in one bed , my father in the other . The second day , we were there . I wonder , now , what the ride back must have been like . In those days I did not think much about anyone except myself . I remember times when it felt like my life was unraveling like the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , freed after some necessary untangling , to the place where I belonged . <p> I never knew Leticia fought breast cancer . <p> I did n't know that B. sold his Mustang convertible because his best friend died when a convertible rolled over , which made B. decide it was time for a sensible car . <p> I knew , the year I was thirteen , that my father had left my mother for another woman who subsequently decided she did n't want him , but that was top-secret , and I never asked for details , even from Leticia , who told me the bare facts amid sneezes from a fit of hay fever , saying it was time I understood things . My first morning in the garden was always golden , whether or not the sun shone . Leticia rarely followed us to the rectangular patch of plowed soil , just down the slope from the peonies that multiplied every year . Herbs had been planted along one edge before I arrived , but somehow herbs never seemed to be magic to begin with . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading everywhere by a channel of mint planted between bricks . Then , amid the smell of lemony mint , I would begin to move the dried grass off the little yellow tendrils of chives , being careful to avoid any bugs that might be crawling near my fingers as I uncovered the garden in preparation for the planting of bug-repellent marigolds and nasturtiums . <p> That first year , I uncovered a plethora of wiggly worms and numerous bottle caps , along with some not-quite-decomposed trash that had blown in and been trapped between soil and dry grass . Beaumont saw my excitement when I found the unexpected , of course . My eyes lit up when I was surprised . That must have been what gave him the idea : to deliberately scatter things in the garden at the end of the season , and to let them weather over the winter-durable things like marbles and coins and miniature plastic animals . Eventually , larger things began to appear : an old green glass bottle , a ceramic perfume container , quite a bit of money , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the future , some mother-of-pearl buttons , fine when soaked clean , as well as something called a NEV-R-Rust-Cake-Serv ( not rusted ) , and a plastic finger puppet like the Munch figure with its mouth open , a very rusty but still workable Slinky , a paperweight with a perfect autumn leaf suspended inside , a kauri shell , a purple Frisbee uncracked by winter weather . He had to have tossed them in after I left , because the crust of dry grass weighted down here and there by bricks showed no signs of having been disturbed . <p> I wish I had asked him what gave him the idea : whether , the first year , the coins might simply have fallen from his pocket ; whether he himself had no idea about the partially decomposed letter written by no one either of us knew that had somehow lodged , half-faded , underneath the grass cuttings . The bottle caps were clearly junk . I suspect I did n't ask because the discovery began as our secret-so mysterious and private that after the first year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been only my puzzled frown , my moment of suspicion during which I looked at him and asked a silent question . Or maybe I questioned him many times . Maybe he denied it . It seems he may have denied it-honestly , at first , but later disingenuously when treasure after treasure littered the garden . That might have been when it occurred to me that adults could lie and mean no harm by it ; that lying was a game , and sometimes it was not wrong to be complicit . I went there at least ten times , but somehow , the last few summers , I lost interest in the garden . " Do n't make her do it if it 's a chore , " Leticia said to Beaumont . <p> Everything was a chore except thinking about Paul Kellogg , the cutest boy in school , and the way we 'd danced together , once in the high school gym , once when nobody saw us , circling around a dumpster at the shopping center . I spent the summer on the phone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the ride to Brown 's ice cream because the only flavor I liked was chocolate , and chocolate might give me acne . For three years I refused to go near the garden , complaining of black flies and dirt under my fingernails . <p> I did n't know Leticia 's cancer recurred , and that she beat it a second time . I did n't know how much the photograph on the wall above the phone of B. smiling in the driver 's seat of his once-new Mustang meant to him . I heard , but somehow did not hear , that my father had numerous girlfriends ( not one of whom I ever met ) . I did not know that my mother had been engaged before she married my father , and did n't really want to know , I guess , which is why I disappeared from the room as Leticia went to get more Kleenex . <p> What is childhood , except things intruding that you are n't prepared for : facts , like unexpected guests , suddenly standing right in front of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the details of Leticia and B. 's present ( how worried she was when he got together with former colleagues , though he always , resolutely , only had coffee ) . <p> The year I went to college , my mother married the high school geography teacher . I liked him-everybody did-though I never knew she 'd secretly dated him , then broke it off , only to resume the relationship after I graduated . My father remarried , divorced , then married his third wife , buying a van and driving her from town to town as she toured with her band . <p> The summer they married , they asked if I wanted to go on tour with them , and I almost said yes . Maine was no longer a possibility : the house had been sold to someone who put up a string of townhouses on Leticia and Beaumont 's four acres . I like to think the garden is thriving , but I doubt it . If people were smart enough , they saved the peonies , which never mind being transplanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's as hearty as anthrax and probably just seeped off to grow somewhere else . <p> I try not to think about the garden treasures that might have been plowed under forever . It was so wrong of me , so self-centered and wrong , to simply end my secret collusion with Beaumont . I 've come to think it was misplaced anger on my part : that I did it simply because he was a man , and for a long time I no longer wanted to trust men . I do n't mean that I came to mistrust them : I mean that in order to be myself , I arbitrarily stopped trusting men and instead put my trust in women . I decided that women were more often straight-shooters ; after all , my mother had filled me in on more than I wanted to know about her romance with Mr. Cattrelli ; Leticia had given me her diary and asked me not to read it until she died , and I had done as she said , finding out only afterwards the extent of B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he 'd upped the ante from bottle caps to mother-of-pearl buttons , what else might have frozen , unfound , in the garden I never again explored ? The herbs took over , and B. stopped packing on grass to dry atop the soil . He turned his attention to pruning the lilacs for maximum flowering . There is no sign , in the diary , that Leticia knew anything about our garden game . I think the first year I told her my suspicions , but as I recall , she was as adept as any adult is when asked the Santa question . <p> I 'm thinking of the garden because I 'm in B. 's room , which is modern and characterless and has absolutely nothing in common with the garden-and little in common with the house in Maine-except that the picture of his Mustang sits on the night table , and the wall-to-wall carpeting is ironically reminiscent of the dried grass cuttings . No one wants a relative to be in such a place , but what else could happen ? He needed someone to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to start eating meals again ; he never could figure out the portable oxygen tank . It got so he could n't understand that he had to turn off a ringing alarm . So my mother and father-reunited again-explored the possibilities , and Beaumont became a resident of an assisted living facility with the ludicrous name of some English manor house . You would expect mutton to be served , to be eaten with real silver . Ridiculous ! But so is the name of the townhouses that now stand on my aunt and uncle 's former property : " Gentry Gardens . " <p> I went back years ago when the land had been plowed and the foundation was being laid , but did n't get out of the car . I saw it with as much tunnel vision as possible , then drove quickly away in case the neighbors recognized the out-of-state car and stoned it , having figured out who 'd sold the property to the developer . <p> Now B. has taken a turn for the worse and has been hospitalized . He has sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for his father 's penknife , so he can open his mail . This is absurd because the only mail consists of useless advertisements ( " We pave your driveway in 1 hr. ! " ) , and what are the odds , anyway , that B. is capable of telling me where to find anything ? He 's in a time warp and thinks he 's his father 's son , and that the knife is , predictably , in his top bureau drawer , and furthermore , that having the knife will empower him and , once again , make him the man he was meant to be . <p> I 'm on the verge of tears because of the pointlessness of my search-embarrassed , if truth be told , because I found this silly errand preferable to sitting in B. 's hospital room . I nodded and patted his hand . I let him believe there was a real chance I could find it . And if a miracle occurs , I might find it , still-down on all fours , looking through the clutter dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haystack magnetized to my iron hand-my hard fist hammering the floor in frustration . <p> The garden is surely gone , though years from now someone planting a bulb or scattering seeds might unearth a screaming figure , as corroded as a carpenter 's nail , and remember for a moment-like an aged man recalling the thrill that came from the quick click of a knife-that there has always been so much more than the present . <p>
