<p> The assignment - to select 10 books suitable for a lay reader that cover American history between the Constitution and the 1850 - sounds easier than it is . There are tens of thousands of books on the period , which saw massive economic , social , and political change , an extension of the United States from the Mississippi to the Pacific , and a series of crises leading to the Civil War . Clearly my list will have to be idiosyncratic , favoring titles that I have read and loved , that seemed to work well with my students , or that my friends and colleagues praise . <p> Over the years , moreover , I have come to suspect that comprehensiveness is a recipe for dullness : looking closely at parts of the past is often a better way to understand it than trying to master the whole story . I also prefer accounts from the time over books by historians because they speak more directly to the mind and inspire the imagination . But putting mini-histories in context and interpreting documents requires some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensiveness problem . <p> After reflecting on these considerations , I came to one conclusion : I would have to cheat and suggest some alternatives to my " big 10 . " <p> Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 Reported by James Madison , with an introduction by Adrienne Koch ( 1984 ; Norton ) . There 's no better way to understand the Constitution as originally conceived than by reading James Madison 's remarkably full " notes " of the convention debates . To a reader willing to take the trouble , there 's real satisfaction in seeing how the convention moved , oh so slowly , from the Virginia Plan to the very different proposal it sent the country for ratification . The delegates were the best and the brightest of their time , and their debates ranged beyond nitty-gritty institutional issues to the morality of slavery , the nature of the country 's needs , and its future . Franklin 's closing speech , asking any delegate unhappy with the Constitution to " doubt a little of his own Infallibility , " has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his countrymen . <p> This said , Madison 's notes are not easy bedtime reading . Just figuring out what 's going on can be a challenge since the convention did n't proceed in a linear fashion , finishing up the legislative branch , for example , before designing the executive . Instead it kept returning to issues , changing and refining earlier decisions . Keeping speakers straight can also be a problem for readers who recognize only a handful of names from the period . As a result , there 's good reason to prefer books about the convention . I particularly like Carl Van Doren 's The Great Rehearsal : The Story of the Making and Ratifying of the Constitution of the United States . Although the opening parts are dated , the book itself is solid , informative , and engaging . <p> Founding Brothers : The Revolutionary Generation , by Joseph J. Ellis ( 2000 ; Knopf ) . This book consists of essays on six crucial moments in the first decades of the new nation that reveal interactions among prominent members of the founding generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , and both John and Abigail Adams . It was long on the bestseller list and won the Pulitzer Prize in history for all the right reasons : Founding Brothers is a work of solid scholarship , full of insight , and written with a style leavened by Ellis 's unintrusive sense of humor . I first turned to the chapter on the Adams-Jefferson correspondence with a brazen " show me something I do n't know " attitude . Within minutes Ellis had me laughing out loud at Abigail 's tongue-lashing of Jefferson . <p> You 've already read Founding Brothers and want something else on the same period ? Ellis 's American Sphinx : The Character of Thomas Jefferson is studded with unconventional insight ( although its conclusion that Jefferson was not the father of Sally Hemings 's children , written before the DNA evidence came out , casts some doubt on his reading of Jefferson 's character ) . His Passionate Sage : The Character and Legacy of John Adams remains , however , my favorite . It captures the endearingly crusty Adams in ways that are missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or for something altogether different , read the first six chapters of Henry Adams 's History of the United States of America During the Administrations of Jefferson and Madison . Nobody has ever written a more graphic and affecting description of the United States as it was in 1800 . <p> A Midwife 's Tale : The Life of Martha Ballard , Based on Her Diary , 1785-1812 , by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich ( 1990 ; Knopf ) . Ulrich 's study of a midwife on the Maine frontier is a minihistory par excellence . The chapters begin with selections from Ballard 's diary that sometimes border on the incomprehensible . From these , with meticulous research , Ulrich teased out a compelling story of everyday life and made a passionate case for the importance of women 's traditional role in weaving together the strands of community life . <p> This is not a book for everyone . I once found it a hard sell to a group of students ( many in ROTC ) who preferred old-style blood-and-guts histories of war or explorations . ( On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder that could make even strident opponents of handguns rethink their position . ) One student , however , got the point . It was , he said , as if previous pictures of life in the past were a photograph torn through the middle so only the men 's faces remained . Ulrich managed to restore the missing half , putting the women back in and making the picture - or history - complete . <p> The Lewis and Clark Journals : An American Epic of Discovery , edited by Gary E. Moulton ( 2003 ; University of Nebraska ) . The journals of Lewis and Clark are , to my mind , more fun to read than books on the explorers ' famous expedition across the North American continent . This abridgment by Gary Moulton , who edited the 13-volume Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition ( published between 1983 and 2001 ) , is now the preferred short version of the journal and replaces an older one by Bernard DeVoto . <p> There are , however , books that help pull together the stories in the journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark Among the Indians emphasizes the explorers ' contacts with the Indians - including Mandans , Shoshonis , and Nez Percs - who ruled the West and whose future was anything but clear in 1806 , when Lewis and Clark went home . <p> Democracy in America , by Alexis de Tocqueville ( 1835 ; many editions ) . Tocqueville 's classic description and analysis of American democracy as both a political and social system remains intriguingly insightful and endlessly quotable . The best translations are still that of Henry Reeve , later revised by Francis Bowen and again by Phillips Bradley , and a more modern but somewhat chatty one by George Lawrence . There is a great deal written on Tocqueville , but for a secondary account I keep going back to George Wilson Pierson 's Tocqueville and Beaumont in America , originally published in 1938 and reissued in 1996 by Johns Hopkins University Press ( with " and Beaumont " excised from the title ) . <p> To be honest , however , reading both volumes of Democracy in America would be trying . Other travelers left more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country that can hold readers ' attention more firmly than Tocqueville 's ruminations . Frances Trollope 's Domestic Manners of the Americans ( 1832 ) and Charles Dickens 's American Notes for General Circulation ( 1842 ) were republished - by Penguin and the Modern Library - in 1997 and 1996 , respectively . Both books caused sensations in their time . Americans have n't liked being criticized , then or now . But then who does ? <p> The Idea of a Party System : The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States , 1780-1840 , by Richard Hofstadter ( 1969 ; University of California ) . Hofstadter 's examination of the period 's greatest unanticipated political achievement is still worth reading . Later studies suggest that the party system of Martin Van Buren was less modern than Hofstadter says , but that refines without discrediting this account of how political parties developed legitimacy in the United States and why they 're good , a point too easily forgotten . On the period 's expansion of the electorate , Alexander Keyssar 's The Right to Vote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book to read . <p> Parties were only one of a large number of institutions that began in the early nineteenth century . Americans of the time proposed and often established one device after another for the betterment of mankind , including prisons , asylums of various sorts , and public schools . Several of those movements are described clearly and succinctly by Ronald G. Walters in American Reformers , 1815-1860 . But to see how quickly dreams of redemption produced a peculiarly horrible American prison system , read David J. Rothman 's The Discovery of the Asylum : Social Order and Disorder in the New Republic . <p> Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology : The Challenge of Change , by Merritt Roe Smith ( 1977 ; Cornell ) . This book , by an MIT colleague , offers an unconventional perspective on American industrialization and its human impact . Interchangeable parts were not invented by Eli Whitney , although somehow that myth goes on and on . The idea began , like so many " American " innovations , in Europe , in this case France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at federal armories , particularly the armory at Harpers Ferry , now West Virginia ( the site of John Brown 's famous raid ) . The reason was simple : The Army would benefit enormously if it could repair broken guns with parts from other broken guns . <p> The ingenious machinery created to make firearms with interchangeable parts had , Smith argues , wide applications in other forms of manufacturing - of bicycles and sewing machines , for example . The new ways of manufacturing also required a disciplined way of working resisted by workers accustomed to the more relaxed routines of craft production . A final comparison of Harpers Ferry with the contemporary federal armory at Springfield , Massachusetts , raises broad questions about the impact of culture on work habits and an openness toward change . <p> A book whose illustrations include the parts of a rifle and a milling machine wo n't appeal to everyone . And , whatever historians of technology like Smith say , some will suspect that innovations in textile manufacturing were more important than those in gunmaking . There are terrific books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomas Dublin 's Women at Work : The Transformation of Work and Community in Lowell , Massachusetts , 1826-1860 focuses on the country 's first generation of female factory operatives and the changing conditions that shaped their lives ; Robert F. Dalzell 's Enterprising Elite : The Boston Associates and the World They Made examines the story from management 's side . <p> All these are scholarly books first published by university presses . But they 're clearly written and important for anyone who wants to understand the beginnings of American industry . <p> Bond of Iron : Master and Slave at Buffalo Forge , by Charles B. Dew ( 1994 ; Norton ) . This gem of a book tells the story of an antebellum Virginia ironworks that used slave labor ; its Pennsylvania-born owner ; and the enslaved men who worked there . Because he discovered an extraordinary set of records , Dew was able to describe in detail the characters in his story and their interactions ; indeed , an entire section focuses on individual slaves . Dew set out , as one critic wrote , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in providing answers to such basic questions as how anyone could consent to own slaves , how masters controlled their enslaved workers ( force , it seems , was of limited use ) , and how those workers shaped their circumstances in a " never-ending struggle against the dehumanizing aspects of their bondage . " <p> Although Bond of Iron focuses on an atypical industrial setting , it shares themes with other modern studies of slavery . Back when college courses assigned Kenneth M. Stampp 's The Peculiar Institution : Slavery in the Ante-bellum South , slavery seemed a remarkably monolithic institution . Since then scholars have discovered how dramatically it changed with time and place , and also how the enslaved themselves shaped the functioning of the institution . For a book on American slavery that builds upon and summarizes a mass of contemporary scholarship , see Ira Berlin 's admirably readable Generations of Captivity : A History of African-American Slaves . <p> Uncle Tom 's Cabin , by Harriet Beecher Stowe ( 1852 ; many editions ) . Did President Abraham Lincoln actually say to Harriet Beecher Stowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this big war " ? Whether or not the story is true , Uncle Tom 's Cabin is the most important novel , and perhaps the most important book , in American history . First written for an antislavery newspaper in installments - later chapters - that unfold like a soap opera , the book grasps the reader 's attention and wo n't let go despite the improbability of its final part . <p> The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 prompted Stowe to write , but the book attacked the entire " sinful " institution of slavery . Stowe made her points through characters such as Eliza , Little Eva , the slave girl Topsy , and Uncle Tom , who quickly became stock characters in American culture . The novel also tells a lot about the mid-nineteenth-century world of which Stowe was a part , including its Protestant religiosity , its concepts of women , even , despite Stowe 's message , its racism . In short , if you have n't read Uncle Tom 's Cabin , your knowledge of this country 's past is seriously incomplete . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book 's 500 or so pages are easy reading . <p> Then you might turn to another big book , Frederick Law Olmsted 's The Cotton Kingdom : A Traveller 's Observations on Cotton and Slavery in the American Slave States , based on an extensive trip the 30-year-old author made in early 1850s . Olmsted published two volumes under that title in 1861 , having published an even longer account in three volumes a few years earlier . Fortunately , there 's an excellent 1953 abridged version , reissued in 1996 , intelligently edited and with an introduction by Arthur Schlesinger , Jr . The pictures of the various sections of the antebellum South that Olmsted gives , the conversations he recounts , even his own irritation with the discomforts and backwardness he encountered are unforgettable . In the end Olmsted decided that slavery prevented the progress so evident farther north ; it served to prolong " evils which properly belong only to a frontier . " <p> The Lincoln-Douglas Debates : The First Complete Unexpurgated Text , edited by Harold Holzer ( 1993 ; Fordham ) . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during their famous debates of 1858 , although they used notes - both sets long since lost . Surviving versions of their speeches came from the intensely partisan newspapers of the time . What the newspapers published was not , however , exactly what their stenographers recorded . Editors at Chicago 's leading Republican paper , the Daily Press and Tribune , fixed Lincoln 's spoken prose , repairing grammatical errors , cutting off run-on sentences and the like , but left Douglas 's pretty much alone . The Democratic Chicago Daily Times did the opposite . <p> Then in 1860 the Republicans published the debates in book form , using the Republican press 's version of Lincoln 's speeches and the Democratic press 's version of Douglas 's , both taken from a scrapbook Lincoln kept . But first Lincoln made further revisions in his speeches ( more , Holzer says , than he admitted ) and removed all the audience interventions that the newspapers had carefully recorded . That staid version of the debates showed off Lincoln 's eloquent moral statements to maximum advantage , reduced his on-site awkwardness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidacy . Subsequent publications of the debates reprinted that " doctored " text of 1860 , sometimes reinserting some of the audience 's reactions . <p> Then how can we know what was actually said in 1858 ? That 's simple , Holzer said . Publish the Republican press 's version of Douglas 's speeches and the Democratic press 's version of Lincoln 's - that is , the " unexpurgated " texts neither paper saw fit to change . Actually , Holzer did more than that . He noted places where the two newspapers ' texts varied substantially and the different ways they described the audience 's reactions to certain statements . Best of all , he wrote a lively general introduction and wonderful descriptions of the scene for each of the debates that depict the physical setting , the audience , and the wild pageantry that was part of the event , as well as a brief gloss of the debate itself . <p> So far as I can tell , this book received remarkably little notice when it was first published . I have read only one serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is way more interesting than any other version of the debates . In fact , it 's the best introduction to nineteenth-century politics I know . To be sure , the debates are repetitious , and it 's fair to skip pages when the speakers dig deeply into the details of Illinois politics . But enjoy the combat , as Douglas quickly put Lincoln on the defensive , from which he struggled to recover . Note how both speakers parried or played audiences that were racist even in northern Illinois , where antislavery was more widespread than in the southern part of the state . <p> People flocked from afar sometimes to stand three hours - the length of a debate - in the beating sun , close enough to the platform , they hoped , that they could hear what was said . They laughed ; they cheered . One heckler shouted that Lincoln was a fool . " I guess there are two of us , " he answered , sparking more laughter . The issue at stake - slavery and the future of the Union - was deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American democracy was young and well . These were real debates , not the scripted serial monologues that pass as " presidential debates " these days . Once again , only by looking back can we get a good vantage on where we are . <p> Well , there 's my list , and it has hardly a word on the settlement of the West , or on wars . Would colleagues have questioned it if I 'd mentioned Bernard DeVoto 's wide-ranging The Year of Decision : 1846 ? A historian writing today would say more about Indians and the environment , but DeVoto told well the more traditional story of " Westward expansion . " I could hardly have listed Ulysses S. Grant 's Personal Memoirs , which includes some of the most moving descriptions of the Mexican War I 've read , since most of it postdates the 1850s . And I 've given no good narrative account of the coming of the Civil War , such as David M. Potter 's The Impending Crisis , 1848-1861 or the opening chapters of James M. McPherson 's Battle Cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel even worse that I said nothing about the sudden , deadly diseases that distinguish the past from our world . I never even mentioned Charles E. Rosenberg 's classic The Cholera Years : The United States in 1832 , 1849 , and 1866 , which gives so fine a vantage on how people thought as well as on what they suffered . There 's also not a word here on the literature of the time . But I must stop ; I 've already tested the patience of editor and readers overmuch . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Situation of America , 1848 , artist unknown . <p> By Pauline Maier <p> <p> Pauline Maier books include American Scripture : Making the Declaration of Independence <p>
