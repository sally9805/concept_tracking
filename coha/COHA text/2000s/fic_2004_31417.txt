Chapter One Friday , December 15th Washington , D.C. Chico " Chico , you better get your behind out that bed , boy ! " Momma yelled through my bedroom door because she could n't open it . I always kept it locked because I grew tired of her invading my room without a courtesy knock first . Besides , I was nineteen and that made me a man . Even though I was residing at her crib , a man is still a man . " Chico , do you hear me ? " " I hear you ! Damn ! " I yelled back at her . I glanced at my alarm clock . Shit , it was after seven-thirty and I 'd slept through the buzzer again . " Chico , do n't you dare curse me , boy ! And you have the audacity to do it right here at Christmastime ? Do n't forget who brought your behind into this world . I brought you into it and - " " I 'll take you out , " I said , finishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and yanked my door open . Momma took a step back like she 'd seen a ghoul or goblin or something . There was n't a doubt in my mind that I looked jacked up since I 'd hung out the night before with Razor and Miceal . We 'd kicked back watching a tape of the Felix Trinidad/Fernando Vargas fight . It was a great ass fight , too . Both of the brothers meant serious business . Talk about having heart ; they had heart and then some . That tape is one of those things you can watch over and over again to get inspiration to do the damn thing with your own life . Too many people give up too quickly , but not the kid . I 'm going to be somebody major and my word is my bond . " You look horrendous , " Momma told me like I was n't aware of that already . " Chico , have you been drinking again ? " " What if I have ? I 'm over eighteen . Besides , like you said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Last time I checked the drinking age in this country was twenty-one . You have no business breaking the law . " " Momma , it 's a crying shame that I 'm old enough to go to war and get my head blown off for this country but I ca n't go into a bar and order a beer . If downing a few with the boys is going to get me locked up , then so be it . " Momma smirked and then laughed . " Chico , you would n't last five minutes in jail . " I did n't like her implication that I was weak . I did n't like it at all . Momma straightened up a couple of figures in a Nativity scene she had displayed on an antique table with three legs in the hall . I 'd broken the fourth leg off - it was the first thing I could get my hands on - to chase off a bill collector who did n't understand that broke meant fucking broke . Thank goodness Momma had finally stopped mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me mercilessly as a child when they 'd visit and see a reindeer in the manger , elves chilling with the three wise men , or a statue of Santa seemingly in deep conversation with a statue of a black Jesus . " God help me ! What am I going to do with you ? I did n't raise you to hang out at all hours of the night doing horrid things . " " Momma , drinking a beer or two is n't horrid . It 's called being a man and relaxing . Going out and robbing banks and jacking cars is horrid . Do you really expect me to sit around acting like a punk while my boys do their thing ? Huh ? Do you ? " Momma stormed off down the hall toward the kitchen . " You need to start going back to church . That 's what your behind needs to be doing . Reverend Stevens has been asking about you every week . I 'm sick of making up excuses for your trifling behavior . I do n't like nor appreciate having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cloth . " " Then why do n't you just tell him the truth ? " I asked . " Tell him that I 'm not in church because I have better things to do than put on pretenses like ninety percent of the other people there . " Momma looked like she wanted to slap me silly . Instead , she just turned her back to me . I rolled my eyes at her back - I may be a man but I 'm still not stupid enough to roll my eyes at her to her face - and headed into the bathroom . One glance in the mirror and I almost jumped myself . I looked like shit ; literally . My curly , jet black hair was kinky as all get out and I was sporting a big ass pimple on my right cheek . That 's the only thing I hate about being light-skinned - other than the fact that dark-skinned brothers have suddenly gone back in style . The slightest breakout and the entire world knows about it . I used to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the absolute worst . The blotches on my face would run most of the sisters in the opposite direction when they spotted me and you could see the big ass marks they left behind a mile off . I was attempting to take a dump in peace on my throne when Momma started banging on the door . She definitely had a door-banging fetish . " Chico , you only have twenty minutes before you need to leave for work . Do n't fool around and be late again . You need to keep that job ; for both our sakes . " " Okay , Momma . " I prairie-dogged a turd , hoping she would walk away so she could n't hear me drop the bomb . " I made you some breakfast . Brown sugar bacon , grits , and scrambled eggs . You have to make your own toast because I 've got ta run . The elementary school kids are putting on a Christmas program at the nursing home and I promised your grandma I 'd be there before it starts . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing outside the door . I knew what she was waiting on . " Thanks , Momma . " " You 're welcome . " She finally made some moves and I was able to finish getting rid of the beer and buffalo wing mixture that was ripping up my stomach . I heard the front door slam a few minutes later while I was climbing into the shower . I did n't feel like going to work that day . Then again , I never did . The only thing righteous about working at Wolfe Industries was that Razor and Miceal worked there also . We had all gone down there six months prior and filled out the applications together . We had been there and done that fast-food gig and it was not the way to live . Shit , I got burned by the fry machine three times at Mickey D 's and that crap hurt like all hell . College was never an option for me . My grades were n't good enough for a scholarship , I was too lazy to play sports by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't afford tuition . I could 've taken out a loan but I have some friends that will still be trying to pay their shit off when they 're in their fifties . My grades were fucked up for all the wrong reasons . I was one of those kids who did n't feel challenged and so I did n't do the work ; even though I 'm smart as hell . As typical in the hood , my teachers did n't care enough to encourage me and I was rebellious against my mother . I wished that I could take it all back because I would have probably been in college on a full scholarship somewhere the hell away from D.C. My daddy ran off with one of our neighbors when I was eight . She was married also but the sex between them must have been off the chain . Daddy walked away from a wife and one kid , but Dena - the whore in question - walked away from a husband and four kids . Her husband moved away in embarrassment . The entire neighborhood knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said people were going to talk whether we left or stayed . She was struggling with this gig as a customer service rep for Amtrak . The pay was mediocre and that was not a good thing . The cost of living in D.C. is so high that most people have to end up living with their parents until they 're in their thirties or forties . Shit , sometimes even their fifties . Miceal , Razor , and I were all hired on the spot at Wolfe and started clocking hours as soon as we passed the required drug testing . Apparently , they had a high turnaround of clerks in the mail room so they were anxious to fill the positions . Two hours after we started on a Monday , it was clear why the turnaround was so high . The supervisor of the mail room , Donald Coleman , thought he was the CEO , COO , or HNIC or something . You ever work with someone that stresses over their job so much that you can see the veins popping around in their head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled . Damn shame , too , because none of the higher-ups even paid attention to him . I had seen him try to do some serious ass-kissing when the real CEO , Tomalis Wolfe , strutted past us in his two-thousand-dollar suits . Mr. Wolfe just kind of waved Donald off every time . I did n't blame him either . Not only did Donald have a fucked-up attitude , he was also in dire need of a bar of soap . No , make that four bars of soap . His ass was just that stank . I mean , damn , soap is about the cheapest thing in a store . Razor , Miceal , and I always talked about his body odor . When he came into the mail room , it was like that movie Backdraft . All the air seemed to be sucked out of the room and all you inhaled is stench . After my shower , I hauled ass down to the bus stop with a bacon and egg sandwich wrapped in a napkin . When I got there , the K-4 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhaust fumes still kicked into my nostrils . Damn , I missed it again ! I plopped down on the bench and glanced at my watch . Being on time was no longer a possibility . That meant going through some Donald drama . I dug into my sandwich - cold already because the wind was kicking ass that day - and winced when I bit down on something hard . It turned out to be part of an eggshell . Momma could n't even scramble an egg right . Shame on it ! When I got to the office building , there was a stream of black company cars lined up out front dropping off executives . Those lucky motherfuckers were living too large . Too bad they did n't send a sedan to pick me up every morning . Too many damn freaks on the bus and besides , I could 've clocked mad babes chilling in a ride like that . I was in the mailroom all of two seconds when I smelt Donald behind me . " Chico , you 're late again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I missed my bus . My bad , Donald . " " Your bad ? Your bad ? What kind of English is that ? " " My kind of English . " " Humph , must be Thug English because it 's surely not the kind I was taught in school . You young fools better learn how to speak properly or you 'll never get promoted around here . " I wanted to tell him that some of us actually took the time out in the morning to wash our asses but I just ignored him instead and walked toward my station where a ton of mail was waiting to be sorted . I spotted Miceal on the other side of the room trying to push up on this honie named Keisha . She was straight-up hurt in the face but had body for days . I wanted to warn Miceal that I 'd heard she preferred to bump coochies but I decided to let him waste his time trying to get up in some puddy that wanted to be licked and not dicked . The men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Alcohol had never been good to him . " What 's up , Chico ? " Razor asked , slapping me a high five . Razor was a caramel motherfucker , about six feet , making him a couple inches taller than me . He was what sisters called a " pretty boy " but he was n't as pretty as Miceal . At six-six , Miceal was damn near a tree . He was dark-skinned with dimples and had a smile that lit up the room whenever he entered . It could be dark as shit in a club but you could always see his bright ass teeth . Women loved his ass . " Everything is everything , " I responded to Razor . " Ca n't wait until Christmas vacation because I can sure use a few days away from this bullshit . " Razor glared over at Donald for a second and nodded . " You ai n't never lied . What I ca n't wait for is the Christmas party next week . I hear that joint is off the fucking chain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had heard the same thing from many people so I was curious my damn self . " Got a hangover from last night ? " Razor asked . " Hell no , I can handle mine . " I slapped him gently across the cheek . " But your eyes are redder than a hoe 's tampon . You ca n't handle your shit like me . " Razor chuckled . " Fool , I can outdrink you any day . " " Yeah , right , whatever . " My nose started tightening up , which meant Donald was within breathing distance . I glanced over my shoulder and he was standing there like he was Donald Trump instead of Donald Coleman , raised in a Southeast , D.C. , tenement . He did n't think I knew all of his business , but I did . I made it a point to know everyone 's business . This honie , Riwanda , had an aunt that used to date him . I could n't believe that shit when I heard it . Donald getting some ass ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that , but apparently at least one sister was hard up enough to spread them for him . Let me explain something before you start thinking I 'm ragging on Donald for no reason . Donald was about five-four , weighed in at a hundred pounds soaking wet , and was darker than midnight but had the nerve to stick emerald green contacts into his eyes every morning . That was some sick shit ! Then there was the body odor problem - I hate to keep harboring on that shit but I might have ended up getting asthma if he did n't discover his bathtub soon - and the yellow teeth problem . Even with his less than desirable looks - to put it kindly - I could still deal with Donald but his attitude just ruined everything . He talked down to people , particularly his own people like me , and then expected us to look up to and respect him . Please , that was just not happening . Not then . Not ever . I started my delivery rounds about ten . Like everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building were at the top of the game . The secretarial pool was always my first stop . That was where all the honies about my age pecked away on keyboards for hours at a time , which was amazing considering most of them had these long ass , fake fingernails . They spent half of the damn day singing along with one of those fools that sings like he has to beg to get the drawers off a woman . Women love it when men seem hard up about fucking them ; even when it 's imaginary fucking in songs . I was shocked when they changed it up on me . Someone had the James Brown Funky Christmas CD pumping through the air . Now that 's what I was talking about . That CD was one of my all-time favorites but it was difficult to find because it was an import . At least one sister in the pool had good taste . I loved the secretarial pool . Anastasia and Shakia - I called them the " Boobalicious Twins " - both had boob jobs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could take a week off on sick leave and return with double D 's when they left with single A 's and not have everyone notice the difference was beyond me .
