The end of the Cold War , among other global events , is forcing think tanks to reinvent ways to raise money and capture the limited attention of policy makers . // The emergence of public policy research organizations- " think tanks " - has occurred relatively recently . More than 90% of all think tanks were created since 1951 and 58% in just the last 20 years . For most of the twentieth century , think tanks were an organizational phenomenon found primarily in the United States , Canada , Western Europe , and Japan . Today , there are more than 3,000 think tanks worldwide-in almost every country that has more than a few million inhabitants and at least a modicum of intellectual freedom . To fulfill their mission of improving public policy , think tanks must compete in two distinct markets : one to obtain funding and one to sell policy advice . Sometimes these markets overlap , as when a government agency responsible for a policy sector hires a think tank to advise it on a specific problem . But more often those funding advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international development agency funds a study to help a national government make more-informed decisions . It is critical to understand the interaction of several trends contributing to the proliferation of think tanks in recent years , as well as the challenges they are likely to face in the future . This remarkable growth of think tanks since the 1970s has been propelled by the following nine interrelated forces : 1 . The Demand for Useful Information and Analysis Is Growing In an increasingly complex , interdependent , and information-rich world , governments and individual policy makers must find expert knowledge to support their decision making . Policy makers need basic information about the societies they govern and how current policies are working . They also need to know about possible alternative policies and what their costs and consequences might be . One problem is that much of the information that policy makers receive is unsystematic , unreliable , or tainted by the interests of those who are disseminating it . Some material may be so technical that generalist policy makers can not understand it or use it . Some information may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the interests of decision makers . In politics , information no longer translates into power unless it is in the right form at the right time . Governments and policy makers are often moved to seize the moment because the right social and political forces are in alignment or because a crisis compels them to take action . In either case , they must often make quick decisions-and this requires information that is timely , understandable , reliable , accessible , and useful . Photograph A demonstrator pounds on the Berlin Wall in November 1989. // This is where think tanks come in . Politicians and bureaucrats around the world have increasingly turned to specialized think tanks to fill an insatiable need for policy-relevant information and systematic analysis . The information imperative is the primary force behind the proliferation of think tanks today . 2 . The " civil Society " Is Emerging as a Global Ideal There has been a dramatic growth of more open societies worldwide in the last 10 years that has elevated the importance of nonstate organizations-i.e. , civil society . These networks of citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think tanks . Most think tanks are hardly the sort of grassroots mass participation vehicle idealized by civil society theorists . Although a few engage directly in civic education , think tanks are by definition elite institutions who claim a voice in the policy-making process because they have expertise rather than decisionmaking power . However , the growth in interest in civil society has raised the visibility of think tanks as an alternative source of policy information to that provided by the state , and as a potential critic of government policy , independent of the state and the business community . In many countries , think tanks have also been called upon to serve as a bridge between policy makers and other civil society groups . A number of organizations around the world have modeled their institutions after some of the more strident advocacy think tanks in the United States and elsewhere . They have been at the forefront of the political changes taking place in their respective countries and have served as a catalyst for both ideas and action . 3 . Now NationStates and New Organizations Are Booming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of nation-states , governmental organizations , and nongovernmental organizations . In 1940 there were only 69 nation-states ; today there are 190 . Equally astounding has been the proliferation of nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) . While accurate numbers do not exist , the number of nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations has been increasing at a rapid pace . The Independent Sector estimates that there are currently 1.5 million nonprofit organizations in the United States alone . The emergence of the civil society movement has put political pressure on governments , which in turn has created a space and demand for think tanks in the political landscape . Burgeoning bureaucracies need think tanks to help them understand the programs and regulations they are generating-and at times doing battle with . A host of think tanks have grown up around government agencies such as the Canadian International Development Agency , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , and the United Kingdom 's Home Office . Today , most countries of the world have at least one think tank ; advanced industrialized democracies have 30 or more . In addition to new nation-states and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of the United Nations . This great surge of new countries and institutions has transformed local , national , and international politics and created a demand for public policy analysis and research . Photograph Demonstrators in New York City 's Central Park protest communist violations of human rights in the 1960s . Think tanks addressing wide variety of issues arose from the social turmoil of the 1960s. // 4 . Communications Technologies Are Connecting the World Extraordinary advances beginning with telephone and facsimile technology have helped to transform the world of think tanks . But the growth of the Internet and its offspring the World Wide Web have made even more dramatic differences in facilitating an instant , inexpensive , and almost entirely unregulated flow of information . It has become much easier for policy researchers to collaborate across vast distances , for think tanks to disseminate the results of their research , and for consumers of think tank products to access that research using the World Wide Web . International consortia of like-minded think tanks have sprung up to share ideas , and in some cases to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform . Simply put , the barriers to creating think tanks have been lowered . The growth of telecommunications has made it more difficult for authoritarian governments to restrict the inflow of information and opinion from cyberspace that they would prefer to exclude . Increasingly , the choices are either to allow untrammeled access or to bar access to the Internet entirely . Of course , the unregulated nature of cyberspace also means that there is no quality control : For very little cost , a racist militia group could disseminate its views through a Web site for a sham " think tank . " It then might be hard for an unsophisticated viewer to distinguish such a source from a serious think tank . In the cyber age , the caveat emptor principle is more appropriate than ever before for those seeking information . 5 . Diversification Among Think Tanks Creates More Opportunities By the 1980s , potential think tank entrepreneurs had a very diverse set of models from which to choose . The tremendous growth and diversification of think tanks appears to be tied to major events that periodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense establishment , the social turmoil in the 1960s , and the Cold War . These changes forced policy makers and the public to find innovative solutions to complex policy problems . The growth of think tanks can be explained by market forces that created a demand for different brands of research institutions that produced new products for new markets . See box , " A Brief History of Think Tanks , " page 22 . Three principal models have emerged : Academic think tanks can be affiliated with universities or independent . These typically are nonpartisan and focus on public policy research . Contract research think tanks are professional specialists paid by government contracts . Among the first were defense-related professionals and the architects of the Great Society . Advocacy think tanks are distinguished by their goal-oriented work , which is to effect change rather than merely inform a client or decision maker . Over the past quarter century , hundreds of new think tanks of all three types-academic , contract research , and advocacy-have been established throughout the world . This crowding of the think tank universe has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niches in order to attract funding , media attention , and the attention of policy makers . Rather than attempting to " cover the waterfront " of public policy , many think tank entrepreneurs focused on particular policy issues . 6 . Political Change Has Created A Policy Vacuum Another critical impetus for the growth of think tanks has been political change . The collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union left a tremendous policy vacuum in those countries . Governments needed to find viable alternatives to their now discredited socialist economic systems . It also left an institutional and intellectual vacuum . The old order was dead , but what new order should replace it ? Not just economies , but governmental structures , educational systems , and social welfare programs needed to be reconstituted . With most of the twentieth century " wasted " under communism and the pressure of global competition leaving no margin for error , many new governments were desperate to make rapid transformations . And with the old party-linked intellectual institutions frequently discredited as well , who should provide advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western model ( or models ) were an obvious choice . The collapse of communism also had several important consequences beyond central and eastern Europe . Even more important in fostering the development of think tanks was the increase in the number of democratically elected governments , especially in Latin America and central and eastern Europe . These governments generally were more tolerant of independent political and policy voices than the authoritarian governments that they replaced . The end of the Cold War also had implications for existing think tanks in the West . It resulted in big defense budget cuts , which placed particular pressure on defense-oriented institutions like the RAND Corporation to refocus on domestic issues or on more-diverse international topics , such as global warming and famine relief in Africa . 7 . Governments Are Seeing a Crisis in Confidence Photograph A malnourished boy awaits international aid in Sudan , September 1998 . Although some think tanks are interested in working on famine relief in Africa , authoritarian regimes or governments with weak democratic traditions may not tolerate independent criticism , according to author James McGann. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former Soviet Union were swift and dramatic , there has been a more gradual erosion of confidence in the leaders and institutions of governments everywhere . The paralysis and poor performance of policy makers in Washington and other capitals around the globe , the seemingly endless stream of scandals involving public officials , and bloated and unresponsive bureaucracies have made the public question the legitimacy of their governments . In an effort to restore the public 's confidence , many policy makers have turned to think tanks to provide them with the substance and credibility they need . 8 . Think Tank Funding Is Globalizing Even with an expanding market for ideas , think tanks still require money to operate . Many of them do so on a shoestring , with minuscule staffs who derive most of their income from other employment ( most often as university teachers ) . But if a think tank is to obtain more than minimal size and visibility , increased funding is required . Much of the impetus for the growth in think tanks in less-developed countries has been the flow of money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources in the industrialized world . Foundations like Soros , Ford , and Tinker give much support , as do national and international development organizations such as the U.S. Agency for International Development , the World Bank , and the International Monetary Fund . One problem with foreign funding , however , is that it can raise questions about the credibility of a think tank 's research and policy recommendations : If foreign donors are providing money for a think tank , might they not also be dictating its conclusions ? But for many think tanks in poorer countries the shortcomings of foreign financing are outweighed by its benefits . International funding has dramatically increased the resources available to think tanks in the developing and transitional economies , offering the only alternative to a truly marginal existence or no existence at all . The global flow of funds to think tanks has also provoked controversy in the older industrialized countries . Some critics have expressed concerns that the flow of foreign money to support research at U.S. think tanks may have come with strings attached , or at a minimum cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute any criticism of the donor countries ' foreign or domestic policies . 9 . Collaboration Is Going Global Along with the international flow of funds has come an internationalization of think tank staffs . Programs like those run by the National Institute for Research Advancement in Japan , the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the United States , and political party think tanks in Germany provide opportunities for staff from think tanks and universities in the less-developed world to visit their peers in the West . This gives staffers access to specific policy ideas and ways to make their institutions function more effectively . Photograph Activists in Bombay protest India 's nuclear testing , May 1998 . The agenda of many think tanks has broadened to include such diverse international issues as global warming and nuclear arms proliferation . // Think tanks have also been exporting their models to other countries . For example , the Urban Institute , the Heritage Foundation , the Foreign Policy Research Institute , and the Hudson Institute all promote their policy analysis methods to groups in eastern Europe and the former Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliates in certain countries . The information age has greatly expanded the scope and impact of collaboration between institutions and scholars . Exchanges are taking place every day as technological advances allow think tank staff to communicate and operate more effectively across international borders . Challenges Facing Think Tanks Despite rapid growth , think tanks in less-developed countries especially will face a number of difficult challenges in the near future . Problems with securing stable funding and maintaining their influence and independence are likely to be critical . Changes in fonder interests are another risk , as is the possibility of a return to authoritarian governments that will not tolerate the criticism of independent voices . Challenging politically insecure governments in countries with weak democratic traditions and institutions remains a risky business . And finally there is the risk of what can be called the " tyranny of best practices . " As the funding of policy advice , ideas , and practices becomes more international , think tanks that argue for taking distinctively national approaches to policy problems ( such as restructuring financial industries or pension systerns ) may attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monetary Fund . Once found only in the advanced industrial democracies of the West , think tanks now provide information and advice for policy makers and civil society representatives in countries as diverse as India , Lebanon , Chile , Bulgaria , Senegal , and Thailand . As think tanks have expanded geographically , they have had to adapt to new conditions . In Asia , Africa , Latin America , central Europe , and the former Soviet Union , think tanks faced different challenges that have forced them to develop innovative ways to maintain their operations . For example , most countries in these regions do not have strong philanthropic traditions or tax laws that encourage private philanthropy ; therefore , think tanks in these countries are primarily funded by governments , political parties , or international donors . The lack of independent support raises questions about their ability to provide truly independent research and analysis . Nevertheless , many think tanks in these regions have attained a highly visible presence and participate actively in their countries ' policy debates . The existence of think tanks is of great consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas where politicians , bureaucrats , and the public shop for research and analysis that meets their needs . In addition , think tanks serve as repositories for expertise that plays a very important role when new governments are trying to fill policy making positions from outside the bureaucracy . Think tanks also help train future policy makers through their intern and fellows programs . If think tanks fail to survive or cease to function independently , then the quality of the social and political systems that rely on them will also decline .

Sidebar The Future of Think Tanks : 10 Trends Sidebar A variety of trends since the 1980s has created new challenges for think tanks and nonprofit organizations in the field of public policy . Here 's how 10 key trends could make or break think tanks in the near future : Sidebar 1 . Funding is tight . Governments have cut funding and private foundations have stopped providing general operating support for most think tanks . The prospect of further funding cuts has forced institutions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This weakens the infrastructure of think tanks and distorts missions , programs , and staffing patterns . 2 . Policy fads are dictating changes . Donors are constantly developing new initiatives to fund at the expense of established programs . Think tanks are being pressured to redesign their agendas to meet new funding requirements . Sidebar 3 . Specialization is an advantage . Virtually every political faction or cause now has a think tank to promote its positions . These specialized institutions are attractive to funders who want to support particular issues . While this trend contributes to more focused research , it also discourages truly interdisciplinary responses to complex problems . 4 . Competition has increased . The number of think tanks has doubled since 1965 . Although this expansion is a positive development , the specialized and issuespecific organizations compete annually for the same scarce Sidebar resources as multipurpose research organizations . A more-competitive environment tends to favor entrepreneurial think tanks over those that are more established or unable to package and sell their programs . 5 . The demand is strong for quick results . Funders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy-oriented think tanks over those that limit their activities to dialogue and policy debate . This new orientation has forced the nonpartisan , multipurpose institutions to reconsider their methods of operation . Sidebar 6 . Conflict over public policy is the norm . The once civil and scholarly exchange of ideas and information has been transformed into a " war of ideas . " This moreaggressive approach has reignited the age-old conflict between academics and policy makers . The new policy-oriented insurgents have out-penned and out-marketed their counterparts in some of the more established research organizations and redefined the way public-policy research is conducted . Sidebar 7 . A new breed of customer must be Satisfied . Politicians , bureaucrats , and the public are now shopping for research and analysis that provide not just information , but also cues that will help them know what positions they should take on issues . This trend has forced think tanks to redesign their products and to place much greater emphasis on marketing strategies that target key constituencies and donors . Sidebar 8 . Communication must fit the market . The need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks to develop new materials that can be quickly read and digested . Short reports and policy briefs have replaced booklength studies as the primary output of many think tanks . In addition , a premium has been placed on media products , such as articles and op-ed pieces for newspapers and sound bites for radio and television . Sidebar 9 . Issues have a short life cycle . The short-term orientation of many legislators and bureaucrats has forced think tanks to operate within an extremely narrow window of opportunity . Issues now have a such a short shelf life that some institutions find themselves going out of business soon after they are incorporated . Think tanks that are out of touch with key policy trends are likely to become irrelevant , if they survive at all . Sidebar 10 . Citizens increasingly doubt their government . Many people have lost confidence in the ability of their elected officials to develop and implement effective policy . The paralysis of governments around the world has created considerable cynicism among the general public . This trend has made it difficult for think tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile . On the bright side , this crisis of confidence has created an opportunity for think tanks to fill the vacuum between the public and their government . Sidebar A Brief History of Think Tanks Sidebar In the early part of the twentieth century , the challenges of managing an advanced industrial economy and increased commitments abroad created a demand to bring science and reason to government . In the United States and Europe , the earliest wave of think tanks shared this objective of bringing expert , nonpartisan advice to governments . Often referred to as academic think tanks , or " universities without students , " these organizations were frequently staffed by academics . Examples include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace ( 1914 , U.S. ) , Kiel Institute of World Economics ( 1914 , Germany ) , the Brookings Institution ( 1916 , U.S. ) , and the Royal Institute of International Affairs ( 1920 , U.K. ) . The period following World War II increased demand for defense experts and technocrats to help manage the defense establishment and its new security arrangements around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 ) along with a host of other research organizations provided a ready supply of what have become known as " defense intellectuals " to help develop the defense hardware and systems that were put in place after World War II . They served as the models for a new generation of contract research think tanks . The social turmoil of the 1960s and its attendant political pressures provided the impetus for the creation of think tanks that became Sidebar architects of the social and environmental programs that blossomed during this period . Examples include D66 Policy Research Bureau ( 1966 , The Netherlands ) , the Urban Institute ( 1968 , U.S. ) , and The Club of Rome ( 1968 ) . These institutions became the precursors to a whole new generation of specialized think tanks that focused on particular issues . During the same period , concerns about Third World development sparked the creation of organizations like the German Foundation for International Development ( 1959 ) , the Overseas Development Institute ( 1960 , U.K. ) and the Institute of Developing Economies in Japan ( 1960 ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think tanks provided the political , military regional , and strategic analysis needed to support the struggle between the Communist Bloc and the Western Alliance . The period from 1945 to 1989 saw a dramatic increase in the number of strategic and international studies centers around the world , such as the Research Institute of the German Society for Foreign Affairs ( 1955 ) , the Singapore Institute for Strategic Studies ( 1961 ) , the Spanish Institute for Strategic Studies ( 1970 ) , and the Hungarian Institute for international Affairs ( 1972 ) . More recently , crises of the welfare state , a collapse of Keynesian consensus on macroeconomic management , and the rise of a Sidebar worldwide conservative movement have contributed to the rapid expansion of a host of advocacyoriented think tanks organized to advance a particular philosophy or issue . Examples include the Heritage Foundation ( 1973 , U.S. ) and the Adam Smith Institute ( 1977 , U.K. ) . These organizations are frequently labeled advocacy tanks because they tend to speak much more explicitly and self-consciously from a specific ideological point of view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war of ideas rather than doing basic research . The end of the Cold War and the political and economic reforms that it unleashed created another tidal wave of new institutions . The Gdansk Institute for Market Economics ( 1989 , Poland ) and the Center for the Study of Democracy ( 1989 , Bulgaria ) , for example , were created to provide the intellectual and political muscle for the transition taking place in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union . In this much denser world of think tanks , new entrants have many models to emulate or adapt , and many different choices have been made . A number of the more recently founded institutions are based on the same scholarly norms of objectivity and completeness as the old guard academic think tanks .
