// Jody 's heart pounded , just thinking about her . He sat at the kitchen table , making a very special valentine . Angela , he thought . First he cut out two red hearts and pasted them on pink paper . He printed " True Love " on one and a big question mark on the other . Next he glued some paper lace around the edge . The valentine was beautiful . In his room , he shook money from his Mickey Mouse bank . " I hope I have enough " Jody said . He wanted to buy Angela one of the red , heart-shaped boxes of candy he had seen at the store . " Three dollars and twenty cents , " he counted . " That should buy a small box at least . " He stuffed the money into his pocket . On his way to school he bought the candy . He told the clerk to put it in a bag so none of the guys would see it . In the classroom , his teacher told everyone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Just drop the valentines there . " Jody had figured out a way to get the candy into Angela 's bag without anyone noticing . Her desk was sixteen steps from the door-nine forward and seven to the right . He looked at Angela , then looked away . She 's beautiful , he thought . Jody stood up and began counting . One , two , three .. At the count of sixteen , his arm shot down . Without stopping or looking , he dropped the valentine and candy into the bag . He took a deep breath and slid into his seat , four steps away . " What are you doing in my seat ? " Bill asked . Jody looked up . " Your seat ? " " Yeah , my seat , " Bill repeated . Jody lifted the desk top . It was Bill 's seat . " Uh , I 'm sorry , " he mumbled . He stood up and moved one seat forward . Suddenly a terrible thought jumped into his head . Since he had sat down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and candy in the wrong bag ! " Oh , no , " Jody whispered . " My life is over . " " Look what 's in Heather 's bag ! " Carmen shouted from Heather 's desk . Most of the girls rushed over to see . Jody winced . Heather was the new girl in their class . She had changed schools when her parents got divorced . She never talked . He had never even seen her smile . " Who 's it from ? " a girl asked . " Heather 's got a boyfriend , " teased Angela . Heather , her eyes wide , stared at the small , red , heart-shaped box . " I do n't know , " she said . " The valentine does n't have a name on it . " " Mrs. Morrow , " Missy called . " Heather has a valentine that 's not signed . And candy , " she added . Mrs. Morrow walked over to see . " What a pretty valentine ! You must have a secret admirer . " // Jody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's the matter , Jody ? " Mrs. Morrow was at his side . " Oh , nothing . " " There must be something wrong for you to act this way . Come into the hall and tell me . Jody followed Mrs. Morrow into the hall . " Now , what is wrong ? " she asked . Jody studied the toes of his shoes . " I think maybe I might have put something in the wrong person 's bag , " he mumbled . " Maybe . " " Oh , I see . " Mrs. Morrow looked thoughtful . " That box of candy was n't meant for Heather , was it ? " " Uh , not really , " he said . " Would you like me to explain it to Heather and get it back ? " Jody looked through the window in the door . Heather had the candy and valentine on the corner of her desk . Her thin face usually reminded him of a frightened rabbit , but now she was smiling . She had very white teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's beautiful thought Jody . " No , Mrs. Morrow . I guess not , " he said . " After all , Valentine 's Day is for making people happy . " He looked in at her , and saw the sun glinting off her hair . " No , I just could n't take it back from Heather . " " OK , Jody . If that 's what you want . " She patted his shoulder and smiled . " There 's always next year . " Jody smiled back and opened the door . Heather ! he thought . <p>
