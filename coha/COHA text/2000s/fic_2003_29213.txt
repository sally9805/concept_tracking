Gingerbread Baby By JAN BRETT G. P. PUTNAM 'S SONS Jan Brett " Can we make a gingerbread ? " Matti asked his mother . " Yes , " she said , and lit the stove . Matti got down the cookbook .

No one can catch me ! " Now the Gingerbread Baby came to a bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he jumped off , landed on a chunk of ice and floated down the river . " Look at me . And what do you see ? The best Gingerbread Baby ever ! " he sang , and jumped ashore . ( Continues ... ) by JAN BRETT
