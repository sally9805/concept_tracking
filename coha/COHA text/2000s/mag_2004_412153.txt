This best-selling author lived by her wits , until she lost the ability to form words Headnote SUZY BECKER HAD ATUMOR , AND FOR YEARS IT PRESSED AGAINST HER BRAIN , CAUSING FREQUENT SEIZURES . REMOVING IT WAS A CINCH . BUT SHE SUFFERED POSTSURGERY SWELLING , LEAVING HER WITH A FRIGHTENING CASE OF APHASIA , OR SEVERELY IMPAIRED SPEECH . Photograph // When I awoke , it took a minute to get my bearings . My sister Robin was in the chair . There was a new floor nurse , Night Nurse . I 'm in the hospital . My private nurse piped up-painkillers . This time I took them . I was beginning to feel the incision . Night Nurse had me retake his neuro tests . " Can you tell me your address ? " Your address is not one of those things you have to think about : Why are you asking me that ? I was opening my mouth . Then , nothing came out . Nothing garbled . Nothing at all . I am wide awake now . It 's all come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you know something and not be able to say it ? What else ca n't I say ? I can see my house with the number on it . Calm down . If you calm down , it will come back to you . " Tell me where you are now . " " Hoshpl . " Oh , my God . My mouth is useless . First I have to think of what to say ; then I have to tell my mouth how to say it . " Do you know the name of the hospital ? " I do . Did . Shit . Wait .... The train pulled out before the words got onboard . I looked at Robin . She put her hand on my arm . " Last one : Who 's the president ? " I know this . Christ , I worked for him for a year . " I know . " Please give me a second . I can see it ; I can say it . " Clin-ton . " It was n't much of a victory , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in to check on you again . You should try to get some rest , " he said . I did n't want to rest . I wanted to ace the next check . I asked Robin to go over the questions with me . She 'd say the answer , and I 'd repeat it back to her . After I had them all down , we talked about other things , waiting for Night Nurse to come back again . Sometimes I would get a whole sentence out . Sometimes a half , and Robin filled in the rest . Sometimes I just could n't give her enough to go on , and it turned into a guessing game , which usually ended with " It 's OK , Suz " and then silence . // Night Nurse returned . " Tell me what you do . " You never said that was going to be on the test ! What I do is ... I am a . What I do is .... " I do books . " I started crying . " Oh , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , where are you ? " // Why does it have to be such a goddamn long name ? I shook my head . Robin looked back at Night Nurse : " It 's getting worse . " " I 'm going to keep checking , " he said . " One last question : Who 's your doctor ? " " Finn . " Night Nurse left us alone again . " Rob , what do I do ? " The question scared her , as if now I 'd forgotten that , too . " Just how you say - ? " I could not remember the words . " You 're an author and an artist . " " Other word ? Longer . " " You 're an author-illustrator . " That 's it . That 's what I say . I mimicked the words . Arthur . Arthau . Arthur is close enough . Arthur-ill . My tongue quit . Arthur-Ill-strate . Arthur-Artist . See if I can say the book title : all I Can Know I Learned From My Cat . My speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to sleep-and wake up with no words at all . One week later , Suzy is recovering at home . Her girlfriend Karen takes her to her first official linguistic test , and Suzy realizes her language impairment is worse than she thought . I was looking forward to the testing . I dressed in my last clean shirt , blue chambray with buttons , my black shorts and my hat , which could have passed for a fashion statement since the temperature had dropped . But neuropsychologist Deborah Knight 's outfit made me feel like I was still wearing a hospital johnny . Her office was dark . The blinds were drawn , and her desk lamp stuck to its job description . " When did you start having seizures ? " she asked . Behavioral obfervation : Ms. Vecker presentedaf a somewhat anxiouf woman who waf noticeably concerned about the difficulties she was experiencing . " Nineteen ... nineteen . " 1995 . " Nine . Five . No . Four years ago . " After a pathetic rendition of my medical history , I handed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of my former self . " How many copies has that book sold , Suz ? " Karen asked . She did n't wait for me to answer . " It was a New York Times best seller .... Number one . Million- " Dr. Knight handed the cat book back without saying a word . " Can we get started ? " she asked . " I think she 'll be better off alone for the testing . " She opened the door for Karen . Then she pulled a large binder off her bookshelf and wheeled her chair over to another table . I wheeled my chair over beside her . She was motivated to perform well and cooperated with the evaluation . " Each of these pages has a picture , " she explained . " I 'm going to ask you to identify the picture . For example " - she turned the notebook inside out and stood it on the table- " if I showed you this picture ... you 'd say tree . " // I blanked on yoke , third to last , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Thing for a lock , to unlock . " But I finished within the allotted time , and I was feeling encouraged . Dr. Knight wheeled her chair away from the table ; we were going off-binder : " Can you recite the alphabet ? " At this point , I knew better than to say yes without thinking . Nothing came to yes witnout minkmg . Nothing came to mind . I invoked my visual memory : I could see pairs of letters-capital and lowercase-lined up above a blackboard , but I could n't zoom in to read them . Maybe if I stop thinking altogether : A-b-c-maybe if I sing it : a-b-c-d-e-f-g . I could n't untangle l-m-n-o-p . " Time . " She made a notation . " Now I 'd like you to recite it backward , " as if I 'd had no problem reciting it forward . As if the slightest hint of empathy would have invalidated my results . I closed my eyes ; the room , the blackboard and the letters above it were spinning . I closed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " Z , Wha ? " What a joke . Zhe waf teary at time , effeciMy when , fhefeneivea fhe waf havinj difficulties I shook my head . " Now I 'd like you to name the months of the year , beginning with January . " " January .. January ... " I could have been repeating the end of the question instead of beginning the answer . Dike tended to want to reff and to queftionf Quickly . I named all 12 months in seven seconds on the eighth try . Then she wanted me to say them backward . The word backwardhad the same dizzying effect . Twelve months , backward , 22 seconds . I lost count of the number of tries . " Can you name the days of the week ? " Can . Could . Did . Only Thursday came out instead of Tuesday at first . She gave me a " very good " on that one . Word generation : " When I tell you to begin , I want you to name as many a words , words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may begin now . " " Apple . " Ass . Asshole . Ass ass ass ass ass . 1 am going to read you a series of numbers . When I am through , I 'd like vou to repeat them back to me . The sequences will increase in length and difficulty . Listen carefully , and try to remember as many numbers as you can .... " " Do two pounds of flour weigh more than one pound ? " Deborah Knight went to pick up her daughter and left me alone to self-administer the reading , writing and grammar tests ( under the surveillance of her assistant ) . I was unable to finish the reading test in the time allowed . New personal worst . The writing test was fill-in-the-blanks . If I had to pick a test , this one most closely approximated what I used to do . You were supposed to write the middle sentence in the style of the other two . I stared and stared at the blank until it reversed out when I looked up at the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's how I 'd always gotten myself out of these situations in the past . " Time . " It was the assistant . " Last one . " She placed the grammar test in front of me . There was no sign of her when I finished . I was free to leave , I supposed , but maybe not-maybe there was a oneway mirror somewhere . I sat there with my hands on my hat and studied the picture of Deborah Knight with her daughter on the desk . Haue you ever tried to imagine what it feels like not to ace these tests ? Like crying . Let me make that into a complete sentence : It makes me feel like crying . Like breaking something , like breaking everything in your office , like whipping that fat notebook against the wall until all the fucking pages fall out all over the floor . Soon after , Suzy 's sister Meredith takes her to the doctor , and Suzy asks to see a psychiatrist . The nurse sent the psychiatrist in . Meredith started to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of her chair . Dr. Saxon pulled up a chair . he leaned back with his hands in the open-prayer position . " How are you feeling , Suzy ? " " Scared-about my speech . " " You sound pretty good to me. " // DISAPPOINTMENT TIMELINE ( PARTIAI. ) // " Can I say something , Suz ? " Meredith asked , then looked Dr. Saxon in the eye and said , " She does not sound pretty good . She is having trouble putting two sentences together . She has a hard time explaining what she does . She 's speaking very slowly , for her .... She does not sound like herself . " " She 's had brain surgery , " Dr. Saxon counseled ; neither of us responded . He opened my folder . " Why do n't you tell me what you do ? " " I write books-I do art . The art- " // " You illustrate your own books . Let me ask you something else . Have you ever had to deal with disappointment before ? " Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at me , his eyebrows raised . " Yes , " I answered . he offered to write me a prescription for antidepressants . Is that your diagnosis ? I do n't want some pills to make me happy like this ; I want someone to help me get my self back . After several excruciating minutes of silence , Dr. Saxon concluded I was through talking and handed me his card in case I wanted to see him again . It was n't long before Dr. Finn came in to see us. he wanted to know how the speech was coming : " You 're telling me you used to be a real motormouth , huh ? " It was n't that ! used to be a motormouth , it 's just-at least I used to have a choice . I could talk if I felt like it . " How 's the artwork ? " I showed him the sketches I 'd done in the hospital . " I have no ideas , " I said , before he could say anything . " Tell me more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to be able to explain it-but the only words I could come up with were , " I lost my impulse . " " You think I took that away ? " " I 'm not myself . " That was my fallback . " Well " - he was leaning forward , looking up at me over his glasses , under my hat- " I 'm talking to somebody . " he said it so lightly . " Some part of you is still here .... " " Pith . Hath . Half . " He leaned back . " Dr. Knight 's preliminary assessment did show some impairment-you need to give it some time . Everybody 's brain is organized a little differently-some of the pathways have been disrupted , but they will repair themselves , or the neurons will find new pathways . I have complete confidence your brain will heal itself . Give it a month . " I would give it a month . Something in me uncoiled . Sidebar " The train pulled out before the words got onboard .
