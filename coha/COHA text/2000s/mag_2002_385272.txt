GETTING STEAMY IN THE BATHROOM " A couple of years ago , I was having a long and hectic day at the office , and my wife kept calling to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I supposed to know that ? ! ' I snapped . When I finally dragged myself into the house , I noticed something on the floor . Smart guy that I am , I bellowed , Why the hell are there rose petals on the floor ? ' Silence . I followed the trail of petals up to the second floor . Suddenly a lightbulb went on in my head . With each step I felt a little less sheepish and a little more horny . In our bathroom I found Lisa sitting in a bubble bath , surrounded by lit candles and next to a bottle of chilled champagne and two glasses . Well , are n't you coming in ? ' she asked me in her most seductive voice . I almost did n't want to , she was so beautiful . It was n't a special day or reason ; she just did it because she loves me and I love her . " Photograph STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN : And he thought he was just coming home to dinner ! // - Brian Billeck Austin , Texas ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was at the train station , holding up a large hand-lettered sign that said Mr. Capshaw , ' the name of a potential client I 'd never laid eyes on but was supposed to meet so I could be his chaperone . When I saw my wife , Danna , walking up , I got a little concerned : Was Mr. Capshaw , who was supposed to get off a train any minute , going to think I was totally unprofessional when he saw my wife waiting beside me ? But a few minutes passed , the train arrived , and he never showed . That 's when I started to really panic . When the announcement to board the train came , Danna pulled out a suitcase she 'd stashed in the station , told me to ditch the dorky sign , and pulled me on board . Turns out she 'd conspired with my boss to send me to the station and give me two days off . An hour on the train to beautiful Santa Barbara probably passed before it finally sank in that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FAITH " I 'm a Muslim and my wife , Sheila , is a Christian . The holy month of Ramadan , when Muslims are required to fast between the hours of sunrise and sunset , arrived shortly after we were married a couple of years ago , and my wife knew I wanted to observe it . So she got up almost two hours earlier than normal the first morning to serve me a five o'clock meal that was fit for a king . She 's an amazing cook , and she went so far as to make steak , eggs , potatoes , biscuits , and grits to fill me up and help me meet my fasting obligation for the day . And she did the same thing every morning throughout the month . It was such an incredibly generous gesture , I 'll never forget it .

When we came home , around 8 p.m. , I walked into the kitchen-and found David , my best friend since sixth grade , sitting at the kitchen table . My wife had flown him from Chicago to New York to surprise me . " I guess I 'm your birthday present , ' he said . We had n't hung out together in years . We spent the weekend seeing a Yankees game , taking in the city , and generally picking up where we 'd left off . I 'm a low-key guy , and I had vetoed the big-party idea . Tobie got me exactly what I wanted . " - Jim Reisler Irvington , New York HOT MAIL " I 'm in the navy , and last year I was only home for five months . Linda keeps me well posted on life back home , but sometimes the letters run a little dry . But not this one : She found a website called www.pillowmail.com that 's kind of like Mad Libs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalize by providing details like eye color and favorite food . Then you e-mail it or print and send . After I read my wife 's letter , I called her and told her it was so steamy , I would n't be able to walk around near the other guys for at least half an hour ! " - Jeff Pickering Oak Harbor , Washington A TATE OF HOME " Ellen and I had just relocated to Miami from New York , and we were both extremely homesick . When I came home from work on Valentine 's Day , I found an express-mail package waiting for me on the coffee table . Inside was a box of delicious creamy chocolates straight from the shelves of our favorite Manhattan chocolate shop-where Ellen had bought me sweets every year since our first Valentine 's Day together , six years earlier . They were just one of the treats I thought I 'd left behind for good with the move , and having them seemed to shorten the distance between our old and our new addresses . " - Peter Margulies Barrington , Rhode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday a few years ago , and because my wife , Bobbie , had rehearsals for a community-theater production she was in , she could n't spend the day with me . I was bummed , but as she left the house she handed me a helium-filled balloon and told me to pop it at precisely 9 a.m . When I did I found a note inside detailing a scavenger hunt that led me to several local stores . I had to go in and announce that I was the birthday boy ' ' -a little embarrassing at first , but I got used to it as each merchant handed over a gift : a CD , a double  --  scoop vanilla cone , then a massage . At the miniature-golf course , I hooked up with friends Bobbie had invited and we all returned to the clubhouse for a delicious , fairly boozy lunch . The day was a total blast ; the only way she could have improved on it would have been to be there while it all happened !

On my last day I thought we were going to have drinks with our boss at the best nightclub in town . Instead we walked through the door to find more than 200 people gathered for a surprise going-away party my wife had arranged . She 'd had T-shirts made for everyone to wear that had my face on the front and a rear view of my head on the back . I was so stunned that it took me about ten minutes to realize that everyone was wearing me on their shirts ! Kathleen had also made a poster  --  size going-away card that everyone signed . She made our departure easier by giving me a great memory I 'll treasure forever .

I was so driven that I barely ate or slept , much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understood and was remarkably patient . At one point I mentioned to her that I did miss getting outdoors . Inspired , she created what we came to call The Perpetual Bouquet . The first week , she brought me a different type of flower every day and tucked it into a vase on my desk . Then , every day for three solid months , she removed the wilted flower and replaced it with a new one . I had an always-fresh reminder of the outdoors , but especially of her love and support . " - Greg Godek La Jolla , California DRIVEN BY LOVE " Owning a Porsche 911 Targa had been my dream since childhood , and when I bought an old one a few years ago , my wife , Chris , knew how important it was to me . For about three months I parked it in the driveway with a tarp cover on it because our two-car garage was so full of stuff , there was no room . Then I had to drive to San Diego for a rare Saturday work session at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage door was open . Chris had totally cleaned out and rearranged the garage so I could park the Porsche in it . She 'd even put in outdoor carpeting . I was flabbergasted by her thoughtfulness. " - Steve Morris Mira Mesa , California IT WAS IN THE CARDS " I 'm a minister , and every summer I lead a church group to northwest Guatemala , where we do ministry projects such as paving roads . This year , as I was boarding the plane in Dallas , my wife , Bretta , gave me nine greeting cards-one for every day of the trip . Each card included a personal message from her and notes and scribbles from our two young kids . I could n't receive any mail where I was going , but I still had a new piece to open daily , and each one reminded me of my family 's love and gave me a fresh start every morning . " - Rev .

The Saturday after last Christmas , my wife , Leanne , had asked me to call her when I was about five minutes from home . When I walked in I saw that she 'd set up the foot massager-soaker her parents had given me for the holidays as well as my new indoor fountain-another gift-and that she 'd lit an aromatherapy candle . While I listened to the fountain 's peaceful trickle of water over a bed of pebbles , my feet relaxed in the warm water and Leanne massaged my shoulders , back , and arms . She even had our 8-year-old , Caitlin , draw up a menu of food we had on hand and take my dinner order . That special TLC made the stress of the day just disappear .

" - Jeff Hutchinson Randolph , New Jersey TOTAL BASKET CASE " A little more than a year ago , I was on a long , stressful business trip to London . One day was particularly rotten , and shortly after I talked to my wife on the phone and complained about how nothing was going right for me , there was a knock on my hotel-room door . My first thought was , What now ? But when I opened the door , a guy from room service presented me with a fruit basket full of apples , bananas , and big , luscious strawberries along with a tall bottle of chilled mineral water . Attached to the bowl was a card that read Ti amo , ' the phrase my wife and I always use . The basket was sweet , but it was the two words that said so much when I needed to hear them so desperately . " - Edward Lundquist Springfield , Virginia COCKTAILS FOR TWO " Last April I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife suggested we meet for a drink at a nearby hotel afterward . I arrived on time , wiped out but relieved and happy because the meeting had gone well . Together we rode the elevator to the fourth floor , where Louise said the hotel had opened a new bar . That seemed a little strange to me , but when she opened one of the doors , I understood : It was a regular hotel room , and to celebrate she 'd reserved it for the night along with the chichi superchilled cosmopolitan cocktails , salmon , and crab hors d'oeuvres that awaited us . When I asked her later , What would you have done if I 'd bombed in the presentation ? ' she said , Well , then you would have needed it even more , would n't you ?

Jennifer presented me with a gift-wrapped box , and when I opened it I discovered both our rings inside .

' It was the neatest way to start our next year as husband and wife . " - Matt Schmidt North Mankato , Minnesota VACATION FROM THE VACATION " We had five kids aged 9 and under-four of ours and an invited friend-with us on last summer 's family trip to a Mackinac Island resort . By the time we arrived , there 'd already been plenty of stressful and chaotic moments : We 'd forgotten our youngest one 's baby bottles , the kids were fussy on the drive , and the hotel royally screwed up our room arrangements . When we finally checked in , my wife , Tricia , presented me with a card announcing I had a reservation at the resort 's spa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I was treated to hot-stone and pressure-point massages while my wife took the kids to the swimming pool . Later , when I joined her back in our two-room suite , she 'd figured out how to get the toddlers napping , and the older kids were watching a movie . We unwound together over a glass of wine on our private balcony . I could n't stop thanking Tricia for being so clever , thoughtful , and kind .
