Playing it cool was n't in my repertoire , but that did n't mean I could n't fake it . I leaned against my silver Camry , ran my fingers through my hair , and laughed insouciantly . " You 're kidding , right ? " asked my best friend , Lael . " Ooh , " said my daughter , Annie . " You probably should n't have worn white . " I swatted at a bee while trying to remember the last time I 'd gone to a car wash . " Bees love perfume , " yelled my second-best friend , Bridget , who was walking up the path toward my house . " And I can smell yours from here . " " Is n't this exciting ? " asked my neighbor Lois , of no one in particular . " Do n't lose your place in line , now , " she chided her twin sister , Marlene , who was placing a can of cat food in the driveway for the local strays . The bees headed her way , favoring savory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day that Cece has a gentleman caller . " My fiance , Peter Gambino , glowered at her . " For the last time , he 's not a gentleman caller . " I twisted around to brush the dust off my fur-trimmed wool pencil skirt ( Pierre Balmain , 1959 )  --  which was ivory , not white , and hardly designed for such maneuvers . " It 's business . He 's hired me for the week . " " We 've seen Pretty Woman , " said Marlene in a hushed tone . Oh , they were evil , my friends and family , of which there suddenly seemed to be far too many . I lifted up my Jackie O sunglasses and frowned at the lot of them , lined up so innocently on the front lawn of my house . Not for the first time was I struck by the morphological similarity between welcoming committees and firing squads . Poor man did n't know what he was in for . " Cece needs a lint brush , " said my son-in-law , Vincent . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I wondered out loud . Eight people consulted watches . " It 's one minute to ten , " cautioned Hilda , my gardener Javier 's thirteen-year-old niece . Five people hoisted cameras . " Promptness is the politesse of kings , " said Lois , bending down to wipe some grime off her scuffed patent leather pump . I 'd have gone for the stain on her dressing gown , which looked like motor oil . Three people clutched autograph books . " How about one of those cookies ? " Bridget asked Lael , who slapped her outstretched hand . Two women wiped lipstick off their teeth . One little boy burped . " Good job , " said Vincent , his father , at the very same moment that Rafe Simic , world-famous movie star , he of the rippling biceps and laid-back attitude , pulled up in front of the house and hit a fire hydrant , sending a torrent of L.A. municipal water high up into the air . " Water , " said Alexander , enraptured . " Actors , " said Gambino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The flashbulbs went off as Rafe stepped out of something shiny , green , and foreign . Hitching up his jeans , which were riding low on his slim hips , he ambled around to inspect the front fender . Not even a scratch . He strode toward me through a shimmering scrim of water , like the Southern California born-and-bred Neptune he was . I met him halfway . Nothing fazes Cece Caruso . " I 've been meaning to get a new hydrant , " I said . He brushed a strand of blond hair out of his depthless blue eyes , which I barely even noticed . The smile I did notice . It moved slowly , like molasses . " Hold on , you got something there . " He plucked some oleander out of my long , brown hair and handed it to me . Nothing good happens when you refuse a gift from the gods . " I 'll take that , " said Annie , who had been in love with Rafe Simic since we 'd moved to L.A. when she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , looking at me . " Her daughter , " said Annie , overenunciating each syllable . She tucked the blossom into the pocket of her overalls . " I was a child bride , " I explained . " And now the matriarch of the clan , " said Gambino , grabbing three-year-old Alexander from his father and wielding him as proof . That was n't aggressive . Not exactly . " Peter Gambino , " he said , tucking Alexander under his arm sideways and sticking out his hand . " LAPD . " That was aggressive . Little Alexander freed himself and scrambled over to Annie . " Tummy hurts , " he said , though it sounded like " twoots . " He had a Jolly Rancher in his mouth . " We 're leaving , sweetheart , " Annie replied . " Have a good time in San Francisco . " She looked at me pointedly . " Oleander is poisonous , you know . " " Yes , dear , " I responded , kissing her cheek . Rafe posed for a picture with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way down the line . He had a profound effect upon the womenfolk . Hilda 's mouth was hanging so far open I could see the food stuck in her braces . My neighbors Lois and Marlene , former showgirls now in their dotage ( and I do mean dotage ) , were openly salivating , having forgotten entirely about my virtue . " I 've been enjoying your biography of Dashiell Hammett , " Rafe said to me once Lois released her death grip . " It 's taking a while , though . " He laughed self-consciously . " But there 's lots of useful stuff . " " Useful is as useful does , " said Marlene , who handed him her tattered autograph book . " I have Fanny Brice in there . " " Cool . " " When he was a Pinkerton detective , " I interjected , " Hammett investigated Nicky Arnstein , Fanny Brice 's husband . You know , from Funny Girl ? " Rafe looked at me blankly . " I 'm really glad we 're starting in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy seeing the places I talk about in my book . The offices where Hammett worked his cases , the restaurants Sam Spade liked to eat at . " " I 've been working with a nutritionist , " he interrupted . " Her name is Siri . " " Excuse me ? " " Well , Hammett was so thin . " " He suffered all his life from TB , " I said . " Oh . Maybe you do n't know . " Rafe wrinkled his brow . " I 'm not a method actor . I know Hammett liked hash browns , but Siri recommends avoiding potatoes . " " Potatoes , " said Lael , scoffing . " Boring . Sweets are the thing . " She handed Rafe a freshly baked snickerdoodle .
