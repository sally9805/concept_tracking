1 . Savior <p> The pustules on his back : volcanic almost in how they erupted , subsided , erupted . Closing my eyes , I would trace my fingertips along his skin , feeling the circular , hard shapes and slick , raised peaks . I wondered if they hurt when I touched him , how it felt to be so broken out , not only on his back but on his face as well . Weirdly , the pustules added to his appeal , those cool blue eyes staring out from all that red , angry skin . <p> I was seventeen , and he was my boyfriend . Seevert Iverson . I 'd known him all my life and considered him more than just a boyfriend  --  a demigod or a savior , he who stood taller than the other boys , taller than most men ; with skin that might have been uninteresting had it not been for its texture . In a dim light , his face appeared to be melting , except for the cool slitted eyes . I imagined his skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smooth marble hips . the rest of him was unmarred by pustules or by any other flaw . His hair , for instance : thick , straight , ash blond , down to his shoulders . He flipped it off his face and folded it behind his ears , like a girl . He was Scandinavian and looked that way , except for the pustules , which , to me , represented a kind of knowledge not allowed the rest of us . <p> 2 . Bad Seed <p> Everyone called him Seevee . In elementary school he was a nerd , strictly interested in performing science experiments and making models of volcanoes and spaceships . Year after year , it was known , he received the lop score in the Iowa Test for our entire district , and his IQ was supposed to be off the charts . <p> Then in junior high he suddenly went bad , the first in our school to do LSD , also rumored to be the one you went to if you wanted to score drugs . Nobody was doing drugs yet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over six feet tall , began wearing bell-bottoms , growing his hair . He did n't have ache yet , nor was he considered cute by the girls . He was considered dangerous , weird , a little perverted maybe , having turned all that brilliance toward nefarious activities and , it was said , sex . He was no longer a virgin . He would be glad to tell you all about it if you had the nerve to ask , and , if you were a girl , he would be glad to rid you of your virginity as well . <p> Seevee was the perfect name for him : his leering , sailor strut , his fake worldly manner . He threw in words nobody used yet in common everyday language , words like " lame " " wimpy , " and " freak , " as well as phrases he either made up or got out of some book . " The immanence of desire in the image . " " Dispassionate logic of judgment . " " Genealogy of knowledge . " He read all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as first his grades dipped , dropped , and then tailed . He left school , <p> 3 . Chance Meeting <p> I 'm a sophomore in high school , not yet deported to boarding school and still living at my father 's house in Pasadena , when Seevert Iverson accompanies me and my friends to a movie at the Uptown , a double feature . He does n't accompany us so much as he ferrets out where we are going and when , then he shows up and inflicts himself upon us . Draping his lanky long-hipped body over the seats  --  there is something almost feminine about him  --  he proceeds to make rude comments throughout the first movie . He asks us if we like getting laid . He always asks girls that . We roll our eyes and talk openly about how disgusting he is . He says he 's going outside for a ciggie , and , to my amazement , nay friend Margot and I follow him up the aisle . <p> " Are you virgins ? " he asks us as we sit outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backs against the exterior wall of the Uptown . <p> My friend Margot , tinier than me yet apparently more mature , gets up haughtily and leaves . For some reason I stay . <p> " Are you , Nanette ? " Nanette , a name I detest . Sounds gnomish , a fairy ring of mushrooms . <p> " Call me Nan . Am I a virgin ? " I say . " More or less . Why are you so into this ? You were asking girls the same question in junior high . " <p> His acne has recently began to sprout , a small , raised bump here and there . <p> " Sex is an interesting subject , " he says . " Not just sex . What sex means . " He picks noticeably at the fly of his pants . Is he playing with himself ? He almost seems the type who would massage himself in a movie theater or out on the street , and somehow make it look artistic , as though you were the one with a problem . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I say . It 's almost an adult conversation , or what I imagine older , more sophisticated individuals talk about , except they 're not sitting on their butts outside the Uptown on Colorado Boulevard , practically in the gutter . <p> " The man-woman thing , " he says . " Yin-yang . " He 's working his wallet out of his jeans , so tight through the crotch I worry he might have an erection . " Look , " he says , " Nan . " He reaches inside his billfold and pulls out not a fire-dollar bill or a one but a square plastic package . " I keep one of these in my wallet at all times . " <p> I turn my head away . " Is that what I think it is ? " <p> This is like when boys used to wave dead frogs in front of you , insects , garter snakes  --  hoping you 'd squeal . I did n't then , I do n't now . People are walking by on the sidewalk , glancing at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm , a rubber . <p> " Put it away , " I hiss . " Leave me alone . " <p> I stand up and go inside for the second feature , hoping he leaves for good , but when the lights go up , there he is , in the last row ; his legs dangling over the seat in front of him . I imagine he 's staring at me with those cool slitted eyes , as though I 've agreed to something I have n't . <p> 4 . Courtship <p> I began seeing him secretly , None of my friends , not even Margot , knew . Seevee would join us at Lacy Park sometimes  --  the place where borderline dropouts like ourselves went alter school to smoke cigarettes , do drugs , play Frisbee . None of us acted particularly happy to see Seevee whenever he showed up , except those daring or stupid enough to go off into the bushes and buy drugs from him right there in the park . Though no one was eager to talk to him , he was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of school . He said he had business , which we took to mean dealing drugs . And he read . He lay around in his unmade bed , naked probably , and read books all day , Philosophy books and engineering books and books about astronomy . He still planned on being some kind of scientist , but more along the lines of Timothy Leary , his hero . In the new world Seevee imagined , high school graduations and college degrees meant nothing ; it was what you knew and read that mattered , and how much LSD you dropped . In five years , he estimated , the whole country would be tripping . As for how many trips Seevee had taken in his lifetime , he was vague on that point . He said he 'd lost count , kind of leading you to believe he was tripping all the time , perhaps peaking at this very moment . He would never freak out , he said . Only novices or wimps freaked out , or people who did n't have a good source and bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a lab in his bedroom  --  he was probably smart enough to make the drug himself , not to mention his father was a doctor and did n't seem to mind anything he did , <p> Somewhere in the midst of this , I began seeing him . Not sleeping with him , not yet . We talked about sex all the time , but we did n't have sex . Maybe we were scared , or maybe we 'd determined that we 'd known each other carnally in previous incarnations ; that being so , what was the rush ? We 'd hitchhike up to Old Town , and he 'd hook his long fingers inside the back of my cutoff jeans , and to whomever stopped and gave us rides , he 'd refer to me as his old lady . I called him my old man . We 'd go to people 's apartments , people I 'd never seen before , street people who sold drugs or maybe even their bodies , or we 'd hang out at the Green Hotel  --  at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old green awning in front torn and flapping , the building itself constructed at the turn of the century , with that century 's brown stucco slathered on and embedded with small , pale pebbles . The rooms were horrible , drafty and echoing ; you could hear rats beneath the floors and in the walls . This was exotic somehow , the Green Hotel and its inhabitants . These people knew life . We 'd sit with them for hours soaking up their knowledge , although they did n't talk much , women with scrawny naked arms and bruised-looking eyes , men who never washed or cut their hair or beards  --  they looked like sages or the Maharishi  --  all of us swallowing handfuls of multi-colored capsules and partaking from a water pipe that gurgled when you inhaled , the room a sickly sweet steam bath , the stained , urine-colored shades drawn . <p> Later Seevee and I would hitchhike home , Seevee escorting me to the door like the perfect gentleman  --  as though we 'd just gone to a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse  --  ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , about molecular biology or quantum physics , while I struggled to keep my body in an upright position , my torso propped up on my legs just barely , my heart pounding dangerously . For hours I would be deliriously high , unable to come down ; I believed God was guiding my band as I drew spidery ink drawings with tile occasional strange mystic word depicting this world and the next or some previous one that certainly I had inhabited with Seevert Iverson . <p> 5 . Spiritual Quest <p> My friend Margot found us together and guessed the truth . First , more about Margot : she was tiny like me , but not gnomish , better proportioned . Red-haired and Jewish in a town without many Jews , she wore black mascara and favored dark tights , short skirts , and wooden clogs worn down at the heel that thunked when she ran . I thought she knew a lot because she was six months older than me , could drive , and was no longer a virgin . <p> Anyway , she found me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with half our clothes off ' . <p> " Hi , Nan , " she said , then " Oh , " and backed out of the room . We were at a party near Old Town , at a bungalow with cracked stucco walls and motorcycles parked on the front porch . Seevee and I wound up in some back room with coats , sort of a dark closet really , and I 'd been about to let him divest me of my virginity . He 'd been about to penetrate me , in fact , when Margot came in . <p> Part of me felt embarrassed to be caught with Seevee so publicly . By now his ache was flourishing , and he wore it with wounded pride , as though it signified hidden wealth and prestige that the rest of us could n't appreciate . <p> " You 've got to get away from him , " she told me the next day . " He 's a libertine . " <p> " He is ? " It was one of the things I enjoyed about her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He 's debauched , find somebody else , " she said , brushing my hair . This was a ritual of ours , her brushing my hair . Her boyfriend was Paul , they 'd been together six whole months , and so we  --  our other friends and I  --  deferred to them reverentially . <p> " But I do n't like anyone else , " I said . <p> She gave me a list of reasons while continuing to brush my hair : Seevee was a high school dropout , a drug dealer , a drug taker ( were n't we all ) , possibly even criminally insane or likely would be one day . She continued brushing , and I was lulled , listening to why I should give up Seevee , It 's hard to explain Margot 's influence on me  --  she had a certain feminine , maternal quality . Because for some years now I had lacked a mother , everything in our house exactly as she had left it , only dustier , the upholstery faded . My father went to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Margot would brush my hair for hours sometimes , talking to me , making occasional reference to her very Jewish mother . My own mother had been Jewish apparently , or part Jewish , or somebody in her family had been . Being Jewish : I did n't understand what it meant . Maybe a kind of isolation . Maybe this had something to do with why I was drawn to Seevee . <p> " So you think I should get rid of Seevee , " I said to Margot , " Do you think it 's really necessary ? " <p> She stopped brushing . <p> " Okay , " I said , and she resumed . <p> But I could n't make myself stop seeing him , and Margot and I drifted apart . <p> By now  --  overnight , it seemed  --  Seevee 's thee had become lunar or Martian , all juts and crags and peaks , the angry skin thickened , nearly the color of genitals , something almost artificial about it all , as though this were one face he had , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More About Seevee <p> Seevee was adopted as a toddler . Everybody knew this about him ; probably he told us himself , in that voice he affected , cool , breathy . As if he were whispering in your ear , a story just for you . He liked revealing information about himself ; things most people would avoid as subjects . How his parents still had sex once in a blue moon ; how he 'd had his first orgasm at age ten ; how his parents had had a daughter at one time , but that she had died of a liver ailment . That 's why he was adopted , he 'd breathe at you  --  to replace the sister , because his mother by that point was infertile . <p> We knew other kids who were adopted , whole families of them , but to be adopted as a three-year-old , as Seevee was : this seemed practically gothic . <p> His house , in fact , seemed medieval , as much as a house in Southern California could be . Side-stepped down a hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high windows ; we 'd all been there as children for birthday parties , the sort of parties Seevee 's mother thought he might approve of , in which we made chemical solutions from ordinary household products , borax , Dutch cleanser , baking soda . Or his mother would bury " treasure " under the overgrown philodendron in the yard  --  dog bones , fake vampire teeth , shiny black obsidian , the shards of broken plates ; we were supposed to be archeologists on a dig . The birthday cake would be a dark , rich , muddy chocolate , baked with silver coins inside : our real treasure . <p> His mother seemed nice , to do all that for a kid 's party . She 'd wander around in a dress with an apron , talking into a megaphone she 'd fashioned out of a funnel and a cardboard tube , giving us hints as we dug up loam with stainless steel spoons , while she graciously rewarded us with candies out of the pockets of her apron . <p> You got the feeling she would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see he would break her heart someday . While we dug for treasure , Seevee was off somewhere else in the house , doing what he claimed were real science experiments , or he observed us from the high windows of his room , writing down notes on graph paper , his " log . " <p> 7 . More About the Narrator <p> My mother died of late-stage breast cancer when I was six . Her death , the funeral , the outcome , were terrible , though I hardly remembered anything about it until many years later , when I married  --  a Jewish man , interestingly  --  and had children of my own . <p> Losing my mother had everything to do with why I was drawn to Seevee , of course . Our shared feelings of abandonment . He and I were linked together , lost puzzle pieces you might find in the back of a closet . <p> My father did n't remarry ; he was too busy worrying about me , and for good reason . He found my diary with its details about sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 8 . Unrepentant <p> The Bishops School for Girls in La Jolla , California : thin , polyester plaid uniforms , white blouses , saddle shoes , study halls , mandatory chapel services . I hopped the wall every chance I got and ran two blocks to the ocean for a smoke . Not just the cigarette kind . I sat on cliffs overlooking the boiling surf , lighting one match after another , the wind sucking out the flame , the burning taste of sulfur in the back of my throat . <p> Then there was the motel across the street from Bishops , still there to this day . One night I climbed the thick , high wails of the boarding school , eluding the night watchman with his salt pellet gun , in order to meet Seevee . We made love thirteen times in a row before I hobbled back over the wall , walking bowlegged the rest of the week . <p> He was the reason I 'd been sent to boarding school in the first place , of course . Seevee , meanwhile , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father to allow him to live in nearby Mission Beach . <p> We talked on the phone , flipping through phone books in search of the name of a nice boy my father would approve of . Edward Lowell , Ed for short . As long as your parents approved of the name , you could date the guy and spend the majority of your weekends with him . <p> Whenever Seevee came to pick me up , I had to remember to refer to him as Edward Lowell . " Hi , Ed , " I would say when he met me in the school 's lobby , the lady at the switchboard suspicious of his black motorcycle boots , his long hair . His ache , which could make him look truly fierce , He would try to wear a shirt with a collar , which somehow made the overall impression worse . He did n't look like somebody named Ed Lowell , any more than I belonged at this boarding school . <p> On Saturdays he would pick me up at Bishops at eleven a.m. , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to be back until midnight ; for such a strict Episcopalian girls " school , this was its one liberal rule , clearly a loophole or simply a mistake . So for twelve hours , one hour being devoted to the commute , he and I ingested mushrooms , smoked dope , and had long sessions on his bed , a mattress on the floor . Later , starved , we would step out for a greasy hamburger on the boardwalk , stopping to watch the old woody roller coaster at Belmont Park . <p> 9 . Honeymoon Over <p> Soon , much too soon , I discovered Seevee was doing heroin . Mainlining . I even tolerated it for a while , watching him shoot himself up . He tied his arm with rubber tubing , probably gotten from his father , until his vein roiled up , greenish blue , an underground river dammed up . <p> It proved too much for me , even me , and I started staying in weekends , actually doing a little homework , though still I was in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of December , Seevee did n't call when he was supposed to . I had to call him . And call and call him . There was no answer , so the following Saturday I signed myself out and took the bus to Mission Beach . I knocked on his door . A strange , ugly girl answered , short and broad-shouldered . <p> " Who are you ? " she said . <p> " Who are you ? " When she did n't answer , I said , " I 'm looking for Seevee . " <p> " He 's asleep . " She gestured vaguely toward his bedroom . <p> " Well , I 'm his girlfriend  --  " <p> " ' Oh ? " <p> I pushed my way past her . Seevee was asleep all right , with a girl asleep next to him . I shook him awake , I slapped him awake . <p> " Seevee ! " <p> " Wha  --  ? Oh , Nan . Hi . " <p> I slugged his arm repeatedly . " Who is she ? What is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was younger than I was , maybe as young as twelve or thirteen , and her face was dirty , her brown hair stringy . <p> " That 's Sunflower . She 's a runaway . " <p> " She 's a child , Seevee  --  only a child . How old is she ? What is wrong with you ? " <p> " We did n't do anything . " Those cool blue eyes of his , peering out from the red angry skin of his face , appeared elongated , almost Asiatic . <p> " Why are you naked , then ? " I lifted the sheet off her slightly . <p> " So is she . " <p> " I do n't know , she just crashed here . Nan , you 're acting bourgeois . " He said it in a whisper , cupping my breast . <p> I backed away . " Do n't . " <p> " I still love you , Nan . " <p> " Then tell me the truth . " <p> " Okay , " he sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , Seevee . She barely has breasts . " <p> Nauseated , I left the room . All this time the girl in the bed had n't stirred . The other girl , whoever she was , sat at the kitchen table smoking a cigarette . <p> " Are you a runaway , too ? " I said . <p> " Naw , I live down the street . " <p> She could n't have been much older than me , but she looked forty , a permanently aged face , tough skin , blackheads . Hair that had been dyed a number of times , probably , then dyed back to this brassy color , almost greenish . <p> I sat down at the table . " What 's your name ? " I asked . <p> " Casey . " She opened up a safety pin and cleaned out dirt from under her fingernails . <p> " So you know Seevee . " <p> " Obviously . " She yawned . <p> " Could you tell me what 's going on here ? Who 's that girl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " She got up to clean an ashtray , carefully removing all the roaches first and organizing them into a pile . I 'd never seen anyone so ugly and sullen , and for a moment I longed for nay boarding school with its high walls and ferned gardens and well-off girls with good skin , the smell of Noxzema and the school 's bath towels , washed in the school laundry : it was a smell strangely like the cookies my mother used to buy , butter cookies from Van de Kamp 's , crystallized sugar on top . They came in a tin with a picture of a windmill on it and a girl in a white apron and clogs . <p> " Hey , Casey ? " It was Seevee . He called her in a way that told me he did so all week , all during the week when I went to my classes clutching my three-ring binder and books and wearing my plaid uniform and saddle shoes with socks . " Come here and check this out . It 's Sunflower . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went into his bedroom , while I sat there holding my stomach , menstrual cramps . The hurt  --  as deep as when my mother had died . <p> Then : <p> " Nan ? You 'd better come in here , " <p> What was that tone in his voice ? An offhand sort of need , but need  --  maybe it was n't over yet between us ? <p> " Nan ! " Desperation in his voice . <p> I jumped up , then hesitated : imagining what trick , what further torment he had prepared for me in that room . What was Sunflower doing now , the poor girl , some kind of trick learned in a circus ? Did she have two vaginas , as in a sideshow ? Was he about to rape her again ? <p> " Get in here , damn it ! " <p> 10 . Exit <p> The girl would n't wake up , and her skin was cold  --  why had n't I noticed when I sat beside her sad little body ? <p> They yelled in her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her pulse . They discussed calling 911 , but Seevee said no , that would n't be cool with all the drugs here . No , he said , let 's carry her to the free clinic down the street , and he folded his hair behind his ears as if that was that . <p> I stood at the doorway of his bedroom , and it was like watching a play , the actors going about their dramatics unaware of me . <p> " Quit staring and help us out ! " Seevee told me . I 'd never seen him in charge like this before , giving orders , moving with such purpose ; it made me think of his father , the doctor , Casey and I in the role of nurses in an operating theater . <p> " Move , Nan , move ! " <p> Numbly I held out a T-shirt of Seevee 's . <p> " Is she going to be all right ? " I asked . <p> " Jesus Christ , Nan , " Seevee said . I caught a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel strangely , sickly reassured  --  like seeing an adult 's wristwatch or the sight of a veteran 's tattoo . <p> It is not easy dressing an unconscious person , but they could n't bring her in naked , she had to have something on . We put on the T-shirt and a pair of Seevee 's boxers , all of us tugging and pulling , her cold limbs flopping against us . <p> We carried her down the street , each of us grabbing a part of her , like hoisting a duffel bag . People did n't really notice much , amazingly , but that was Mission Beach then . Seevee 's hair swung over his eyes , his acne partially obscured . <p> We set her down outside the door of the free clinic , and Seevee touched my hand . " Hey , let 's go . " <p> I did n't understand and wondered why he was walking away from the door and away from Sunflower and me . <p> " Come on , " he said . <p> Casey was already hurrying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head no . <p> Seevee held out his arms , as if to comfort me . " There 's nothing we can do , babe . " <p> " We ca n't leave her ! " <p> " Nan , she 's dead " <p> I stared in horror at the small heart-shaped face , grimy and mosquito-bitten , the half-closed eyelids and barely visible , staring eyes . " She 's not dead ! " <p> " She 's dead . Come on , I ca n't stand around talking . What if the cops  --  ? I 've got ta get out of here , it 's not safe for me here . You know that , Nan . " <p> " Go , " I said . <p> He backed away from me slowly , cat steps , turning his head side to side , checking for cops , the pustules on his neck revealed and chilling to look at , raised and raw with shame . <p> Go ! I never want to see you again ! Go ! " <p> Already I was kicking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a dead girl here , somebody help us ! " <p> Then the girl vomited , black material with grit in it , like coffee grounds or lava that had cooled and dried and crumbled into little bits , shoring up inside of her , and she was like my mother then , when I had seen her vomit into a basin once , near death  --  molten rock that burned like hell itself . Help us please , I shouted . <p> 11 . Death of the Anti-hero <p> He wrote me once in college  --  my father , to my astonishment , having given him my address in Boston . Half of Seevee 's letter seemed devoted to this subject : " Boston ! ! ? ? What are you doing all the way out in Boston ? If you do n't answer this letter , I might have to come out there and find you . " I found the prospect creepy . He was in the Navy by then , recently promoted , he said , to petty officer . <p> In later years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , though he and the mother had not married . I imagined his face scarred from ache , surely now healed , and I considered the runaway girl who survived , her body battered and used by other people  --  Seevee 's casual remorselessness . <p> He died alone in prison finally , in Mexico . There was some question as to how he 'd died , a suicide or was that just what the police said to cover up their crime ? <p> I think of Seevee 's mother a lot , how at first she lost an infant daughter , then , many years later , her son  --  how , in degrees , our own children are always being lost to us , though never as brutally as this . I think of his mother at home by herself now , slowly turning the pages of a photo album , pictures of children digging for treasure , pictures of children eating cake . Perhaps I 'm in that photo album , a mother 's finger brushing my cheek for a silken moment before she goes on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
