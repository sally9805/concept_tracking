Section : EMINENTOES Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez is a Fidel Castro on steroids . So why is n't the U.S. paying more attention to this oily creature ? <p> OIL IS THE GREAT CORRUPTER OF NATIONS . Those whose misfortune it is to live on top of the great oil reserves are destined to be kakistocrats , or to live under their rule . And oil is the great immunizer . Democracies ' dependence on oil makes them hesitant to act against these regimes . It was only after the 9/11 attacks that the oil immunity the despots have enjoyed began to diminish but many , such as Saudi Arabia 's terrorist-funding tyranny , remain able to shrug off pressure to take significant action to break ties to terror . <p> The 1973 oil embargo proved a potent weapon in the hands of Middle Eastern despots against America . Three decades later , it is an even more powerful weapon because we have both increased our consumption and done nothing to reduce our vulnerability to embargoes or politically driven price hikes . That fact has not escaped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of oil against us and his neighbors . While our attention is split between the war against terrorism and the celebrity trial du jour , we are ignoring the most dangerous despot in our hemisphere . <p> We now know who Fidel Castro wanted to be when he grew up . He wanted to be Hugo Chavez Frias . The Venezuelan comandante does n't have to stand , cap in hand , begging for handouts from an Evil Empire with an empty checkbook because his government owns Venezuela 's oil , the world 's fourth largest oil supply . This empowers him to buy and build the tools of repression , subversion , and conquest . <p> Chavez is acting like an OPEC version of Leonid Brezhnev , propping up Castro and working hard to spread the old Cuban 's perpetual " revolution " throughout Central and South America . Believing  --  so far correctly  --  that oil immunizes him from American action , Chavez is arming his military to carry out his dreams and even building a South American version of Al-Jazeera to spread his propaganda . <p> BORN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two schoolteachers , a 1975 engineering graduate of the Venezuelan military academy , and a red-bereted paratrooper whose initial service was against guerrilla revolutionaries . He has been the leader of one unsuccessful coup , an intended beneficiary of another , and the near-victim of a third . Since December 1998 , when he was first elected president , Chavez has been an outspoken adversary of the United States . <p> Chavez was elected in 1998 in an apparently free election , was briefly removed from power in a coup in April 2002 , and survived a recall vote in 2004 . <p> What brought about the coup was growing discontent with Chavez 's anti-democracy measures , anti-church rhetoric , and strangulation of the economy that had led to massive protests and a general strike . On April 12 , 2002 , Chavez 's troops fired on a crowd of some 200,000 demonstrators , killing about a dozen and wounding many more . That brought the Venezuelan military in , and it drove Chavez out . Businessman Pedro Carmona was installed as president and Chavez 's resignation announced . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the Carmona government , and the Bush White House  --  after calling for new elections  --  backed off and failed to support Carmona . By April 14 , Chavez was back in power . It was an opportunity lost that will not easily come again . Indeed , Chavez is working hard to make sure it ca n't , both in Venezuela and in Washington . <p> In 2001 , the Economist observed , " President Hugo Chavez was made on television . " He understands the media : on his own weekly six-hour television show , " Hello , President , " he does n't only talk  --  he sings . Chavez is also a serious student of American politics . That 's why he has retained a high-powered lobbying team , the Patton Boggs firm , paying according to one report at least $1 million a year to coax Congress his way . Former Republican vice-presidential candidate Jack Kemp , whose " Free Market Petroleum " company has negotiated a contract with Chavez 's government , once showed up at the Wall Street Journal  --  in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to talk the Journal out of criticizing Chavez for his dictatorial behavior . Kemp did n't succeed . But though Kemp failed , Chavez will try and try again to buy favorable opinion here and in Europe . <p> Chavez has made it clear that his pride at being elected democratically wo n't stop him from seizing power if voters try to turn him out . " I am convinced that if for some reason this attempt to forge a revolution without arms fails , what would come next would be a revolution with arms because that is the only way out that we Venezuelans have , " he has said . <p> THE DEATH RATTLE OF VENEZUELAN democracy was heard after the abortive attempt to pass a recall measure against Chavez in August 2004 . Chavez 's political forces  --  he 's packed the legislature and courts with his cronies  --  first discounted thousands of signatures on the recall petition and then rigged voting machines to ensure the right result . Jimmy Carter was there to bless the corrupt vote , and the European Union  --  seeking more oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the dictator 's democracy credentials were renewed so he could redouble his efforts to deny freedom , both personal and economic , to Venezuelans . <p> Civilians can no longer own guns in Venezuela . In November 2004 , Chavez 's National Assembly passed the " Law on the Responsibility of Radio and Television , " which allows Chavez 's regime to fine or shut down television and newspapers that oppose him . While he 's stifling freedom of the press at home , Chavez is ambitiously seeking media access to all of South America . Venezuela 's oil revenues go to feed Chavez 's appetite for regional power . In late July , Chavez launched " Telesur , " a television channel now broadcast throughout South America as an " alternative " to U.S. media . There are only two things we need to know about Telesur . One , its president is Andres Izarra , Chavez 's former information minister . Two , Telesur is now negotiating a " strategic alliance " with Qatar 's Al-Jazeera . Compared to Telesur , Gunga Dan Rather was fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 64 billion barrels , its supply is roughly a quarter of Saudi Arabia 's oil reserves  --  80 percent of the Venezuelan population remains in poverty . The Venezuelan economy actually shrank by more than 10 percent in 2003 , having shrunk by almost that margin in 2002 . ( According to the CIA World Fact Book , Venezuelan industrial production fell by over 15 percent in 2003 . ) <p> According to the Heritage Foundation 's 2004 " Index of Economic Freedom , " Chavez " has succeeded in strangling the source of much of his opposition , " i.e. , the free market business community . It rates the Venezuelan economy as " repressed " because of high barriers to capital flow and foreign investment , restrictions on banking and finance , and government control of wages and prices . <p> In a February 2004 speech , Chavez warned President Bush to " back off " from Venezuela 's internal affairs , saying that Bush had plotted invasions and genocides . In January 2005 , Chavez said that " the most negative force in the world today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to say that " U.S. imperialism is not invincible . " <p> In March 2005 , Chavez 's anti-Americanism led him to stand next to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and proclaim that Iran had a right to its rogue nuclear program . " Iran , confronted by the United States , has our solidarity , " he told Khatami . " Like you , we are willing to be free from imperialism . " <p> Chavez rightly sees energy  --  oil , coal , and electricity  --  as an enormously powerful weapon , and he 's unhesitating in his use of it . Chavez is on cozy terms with the FARC narcoterrorists of Colombia . This past spring Chavez cut off shipments of oil to Colombia . He also cut off electricity to two Colombian provinces when the Bogota government sent bounty hunters after Rodrigo Granda ( FARC 's " foreign minister " ) who was living under Chavez 's protection near Caracas . Further demonstrating his displeasure , Chavez closed Venezuelan ports to Colombian coal exports . ( Colombia is the fifth-largest coal exporter in the world . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to buckle under to Chavez . <p> TOO MANY " EXPERTS " AND " ANALYSTS "  --  not to mention Foggy Bottom  --  insist that we should turn a deaf ear when Chavez launches into his anti-American demagoguery . Muddled by a mix of fear and condescension , they do n't think we should be crowding him  --  when that 's exactly what we should be doing . <p> Chavez has threatened to cut off oil sales to the U.S. , saying he would " use oil " as a weapon against us . Venezuela is America 's third largest supplier , selling us about 15-18 percent of our annual imports . A sudden cutoff of Venezuelan oil would have a devastating effect on the American economy . But Chavez is no fool . For all his bluster , he wo n't risk the provocation of a sudden cutoff unless he knows we wo n't respond with military action . <p> Meanwhile , because we buy about 60 percent of Venezuela 's oil production , Chavez is allying himself with oil customers  --  notably China and India  --  to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Chavez , our reliance on his oil means we wo n't interfere in his military plans for South and Central America . In April , Chavez announced a new " loyal reserve " force that he wants to be two-million-soldiers strong and under his personal command . To arm them , he has turned to Russia and Old Europe . <p> Chavez announced that his government is buying 100,000 AK-47 rifles from Russia . Asked about that in a March 2005 press conference with Brazilian Vice President Jose Alencar , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he was concerned about the Venezuelan arms buy . He said , " I ca n't imagine what 's going to happen to 100,000 AK-47s . I ca n't imagine why Venezuela needs 100,000 AK-47s . I just hope that . it does n't happen . I ca n't imagine that if it did happen , that it would be good for the hemisphere . " <p> Mr. Rumsfeld was being far too diplomatic . He knows what will happen to those rifles . Some will be used to arm Venezuelan troops and some will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in the FARC . <p> There was a brief outcry at several reports that Spain had sold " chemical warfare " agents and radioactive materials to Venezuela in 2004 . But the chemical weapons appear to have been no more than non-lethal tear gas agents . What the radioactive materials are remains unclear . Far clearer is Spain 's sale of oceangoing warships  --  corvettes and frigates  --  to Venezuela , as well as coastal patrol boats . Russia is selling it attack helicopters . Chavez is arming as heavily and quickly as he can . But for what ? And what can we do about it ? <p> It 's unlikely that Chavez is going to conduct an outright invasion of his neighbors , but his growing military is clearly meant to intimidate them . Even if he ca n't assemble the two-million-man force ( which seems likely in the near future ) , he can blackmail his neighbors into silence and inaction . They wo n't act to stop Venezuelan sponsorship of terrorist forces throughout Central and South America . The Sandinista revival in Nicaragua , FARC in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better armed and funded by Chavez . As much as they may wish to resist , Venezuela 's neighbors lack the means . <p> Chavez maybe misjudging us . He knows that , historically , America has intervened whenever Central or South American problems arose . But Chavez apparently believes oil makes him as immune to intervention as it has made Saudi Arabia . In this he is mistaken , because Venezuela is not Saudi Arabia and Hugo Chavez 's roots do n't go as deep as the oil wells ' drill . <p> Venezuela 's democracy may be dormant , not dead . In the decade or more that it will take Chavez to embed his revolution in its military and economy , he is vulnerable . Those in the military , the church , the unions , and the business community can still send him on a one-way trip to Havana . We should be helping them in every way we can . <p> There is no thought of  --  or appetite for  --  American military action against Chavez . Truthfully , there is n't sufficient reason or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of votes in the Organization of American States , and none of his neighbors dare risk open opposition to him . <p> What we can do  --  and what Mr. Rumsfeld began last spring  --  is to revitalize our relationships with Chavez 's neighbors and the democracies of Central and South America . When Rumsfeld visited Argentina and Brazil , he began the process of surrounding and containing Chavez so as to give the Venezuelan people time to gather together to throw him out . <p> We need to continue building such alliances , including military training and cooperation , with Chavez 's vulnerable neighbors . A few mutual defense treaties would circumscribe Chavez 's power . The more we stand with these nations , the less Chavez will be able to destabilize our backyard , and the sooner he will disappear from the international stage . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Jed Babbin <p> <p> Jed Babbin , an American Spectator contributing editor , is also author of Inside the Asylum : Why the UN and Old Europe Are Worse Than You Think ( Regnery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
