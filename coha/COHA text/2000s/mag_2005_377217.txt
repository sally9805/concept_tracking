America began its life by throwing off a king and has been crowning them ever since . We have a King of Pop , a King of All Media , a King of Beers . That Johnny Carson was dubbed the King of Late Night , at first blush , says less about him than about our national case of regis envy . <P> But in Carson 's case the title may for once have been apt . What we lost when we became a republic was a sense of the slow sweep of history . Our Presidents serve for four to eight years  --  even F.D.R. went just over 12 . Carson ruled the Tonight Show for nearly 30 : enough time for a baby to be born , grow up and have babies of her own ; enough time to span a real historical era . He took to the air in 1962 , weeks before the Cuban missile crisis . He departed in 1992 , just months after the breakup of the Soviet Union . The greatest Presidents have mere administrations . Johnny Carson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entertainer , when he died Jan. 23 of emphysema at age 79 , the reaction was like that to the passing of a head of state  --  specifically , Ronald Reagan 's last year . On Tonight , Carson did a dead-on impression of Reagan , but the resemblance did not end there . Both men defined how to accrue and wield power in the mass-media age . They were two of the last broadcasters : Carson , compared with today 's niche entertainers ; Reagan , contrasted against today 's red-and-blue-fixated political micromarketers . Both were Midwesterners transplanted to California who merged their coastal charm and Middle American affability . <P> Of course , Reagan was loved and hated intensely , whereas Carson enjoyed the benefits of never having , say , fired thousands of air-traffic controllers . Reagan took a side unapologetically  --  Carson ribbed him on a 1978 show as " a little to the right of the Orkin exterminator . " Carson held his politics close and kept his jokes nonpartisan . ( A rare time that he did anything remotely political was when he hosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Communicator , Carson was a paradox of warm and cool , a man who made millions of Americans feel they knew him and yet was an enigma even to close associates . He was zealously private and distant to most , always approachable , rarely approached . Carson was in danger last week of posthumous teddy-bearization , with eulogists praising him as " calm " and " gentle . " That was n't even true of his TV persona  --  he laced his humor with sarcasm and sexual danger , and he batted Ed McMahon about like a piata . In private Carson was standoffish and in his marriages admittedly no saint . His jokes about his serial monogamy endeared him to viewers , but you do n't rack up three divorces by being a harmless sweetie . <P> What impressed people as " calm " was really a presidential strength : control . Carson was the master of the small gesture , and he would figuratively disarm himself by resting his hands in his pockets . That only made him stronger . He could hold us with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which he teared up as Bette Midler serenaded him with One for My Baby ( and One More for the Road )  --  was one of his most memorable but least characteristic , because we almost saw him let loose the reins .
