<p> My friend Anne has a Christmas Eve potluck dinner every year , and my assignment , for years past and presumably in perpetuity , is to bring the brisket . At least half the guests are Jewish , as Anne and I both are , and a slow-cooked brisket is our holiday food . Christmas Eve is n't our holiday , but Anne insists on the brisket . <p> Last year , I rebelled . I was in the midst of some stressful work and did n't have the energy for a long cooking project . Could n't someone else bring the brisket this time ? I showed up at Anne 's house with a nice salad , and of course no one else had seized the brisket opportunity . The disappointment about the missing dish was so obvious  --  among Jews and non-Jews  --  and my guilt so profound that I knew I had brought my last salad to this party . <p> With the first night of Hanukkah falling on Christmas Day this year , many mixed households may be looking for a crossover meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominate brisket . <p> It has the added advantage of reheating well . You can braise it a day ahead , before the relatives arrive and chaos descends , and rewarm it for the holiday meal . <p> " One day you cook it and it smells so wonderful , " says Deborah Grossman , a Pleasanton food writer . " Then the next day when you 're reheating it , you get the lovely aromas again . " <p> Rethinking the recipe <p> With my own date with a brisket looming , I decided it was time to revisit my recipe . My usual method  --  browning the brisket , then braising it with mountains of sliced and browned onions  --  is perfectly fine , but predictable . <p> I wanted a departure , but nothing radical , and definitely nothing sweet , which is my complaint about most Jewish brisket recipes . They have too much honey or brown sugar , sometimes even ketchup , and often dried fruit such as prunes and apricots . <p> My research turned up three great candidates , all of them under consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty food retailer in Oakland and Berkeley , makes a classic French-style braise with tomato , red wine and thyme . The recipe from the store 's chef , Scott Miller , produces a particularly lovely sauce , which is what brisket is half about anyway . <p> Marlene Sorosky Gray , the Danville author of several books on Jewish food , provided an ultra-simple recipe that does n't even call for browning the meat . <p> A sweet note <p> " Of all my brisket recipes , it 's my favorite , " says Gray . The use of cranberry juice and dried cranberries gives the dish what I would call a Jewish taste , but it is n't overly sweet . <p> Another strong contender , a modified bollito misto , sounds stodgy when it 's translated into English as boiled beef . But made with the fattier part of the brisket , the so-called point cut or second cut , the meat is fork tender and sublime . <p> Boiled potatoes , chickpeas and fennel and a lively Italian salsa verde ( parsley sauce ) accompany it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For those who like them , marrow bones cooked in the broth for the final few minutes are a nice addition . <p> Terminology confusion <p> Reflecting on last year 's Christmas Eve fiasco , I speculated that none of the other guests had stepped up to the plate in part because brisket is a mystery to many . Retail butchers and recipes use so many different names for the various parts of a whole brisket  --  first cut , front cut , flat cut , point cut , deckle point , round  --  that shoppers can be confused about what exactly they 're buying . <p> The brisket is a roughly rectangular piece of meat located on the lower side of the steer , just behind the foreshank and below the shoulder . It gets a good workout during the steer 's life , so it is naturally tough . It needs slow , moist-heat cooking to make it tender . A whole one , trimmed , weighs about 10 pounds , too big for many households . <p> That 's why briskets are rarely sold whole but almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to separate this massive cut into its two component muscles . That 's the procedure endorsed by the North American Meat Processors Association and codified in the NAMP " Meat Buyers Guide , " the industry bible . <p> Butchers following NAMP guidelines would separate the top , or outer , muscle , officially called the point cut , from the larger inner muscle , officially called the flat cut . <p> Point cut preferred <p> The point cut is the smaller of the two . It is thinner , fattier and more flavorful , which makes it the choice of meat connoisseurs like Berkeley 's Bruce Aidells , co-author of " The Complete Meat Cookbook " ( Houghton Mifflin ) . Some butchers refer to it as the second cut or deckle point , as it contains the deckle , a hard pocket of fat . Others erroneously call this whole piece the deckle . <p> The flat cut is larger , thicker , more uniform in shape and leaner . It is often referred to as the first cut and is what most people probably consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty sizable piece of meat  --  about 7 pounds  --  many retail butchers cut it in two . One piece , which is more square and uniform in shape , is typically called the flat half . The other piece , roughly triangular , may be labeled as the point half . <p> Confused yet ? <p> Many butchers consider the fatty point cut , or second cut , virtually unsalable as brisket , so they treat it as trim and grind it . Their customers prefer the beauty , uniformity and lean appearance of the flat cut , or first cut . <p> They do n't know what they 're missing . <p> " I hate that expression ' first cut ' because it makes it sound like it 's better , when in fact it is n't , " says Arthur Schwartz , author of " Arthur Schwartz 's New York City Food " ( Stewart , Tabori &; Chang ) and a forthcoming book on New York Jewish cooking . " If I could buy just the second cut , I would . " <p> In practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAMP guidelines . They simply cut the whole thing in half . " In retail , they want it easy , " says Bill Burch , head of processing for Wine Country Meats , a Napa wholesaler . " Cut it in half and be done with it . " <p> Flat or round cut ? <p> This method produces two roughly equal pieces typically labeled as first cut ( a.k.a. flat or round ) and front cut ( a.k.a. deckle , deckle point or point ) . The first cut comes entirely , or almost entirely , from the flat , to use the NAMP term . The front cut includes some of both muscles and is thus fattier and more flavorful . <p> " People say they want the round , but then they say it 's dry , " says Miller , the Pasta Shop chef , who uses the second cut for his braised brisket . In fact , it 's easy to make a dry , stringy brisket if you use only the first cut , in part because the muscle is relatively lean and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " How could it possibly be succulent ? " says Schwartz . " But people do n't want to pay for fat , which is stupid . If butchers could leave the fat on , they would n't charge so much per pound . And of course you can trim the fat after it 's cooked . <p> Brisket slims down <p> " I have this theory , " continues Schwartz . " I think that in the ' leaning ' of American beef , brisket has suffered more than most cuts . It used to be such a succulent piece of meat . " <p> Schwartz believes the most flavorful brisket is a whole brisket only lightly trimmed of external fat . After cooking , he separates the two muscles and removes the layer of fat between them . Then he slices each muscle separately . <p> Those who insist on cooking the lean first cut should at least be sure to purchase USDA Choice meat , advises Aidells . USDA Select , a lower grade , which some supermarkets carry , has less marbling and will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brown <p> Cooks also dispute the merits of searing the meat before braising . " Never , " says Gray about browning , " and I 've experimented with it a lot . If you overbrown it , it gets a crust and it 's much harder to slice . " <p> On the matter of cooking brisket ahead , there is more agreement . <p> " The best thing to do is chill it so you can cut off some of the fat , then slice and reheat with the gravy , " says Grossman . " That 's what my grandmother would do . It tastes better ; the flavors meld . " <p> A cooked brisket is much easier to slice when it 's cold and firm , and any fat that congeals on top of the refrigerated sauce can be easily removed . Like other meats , brisket should always be sliced against the grain . <p> Slow , moist-heat cooking dissolves the tough collagen in the brisket 's connective tissue , but the process takes time . " I think most recipes are written incorrectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two to three hours , but I find it takes four to five . When a fork goes in easily , that 's how you know it 's really tender . " <p> Armed with all this background from the experts , I 'm hoping to cook the best brisket ever this year . My friend Anne and her guests may not notice the brisket 's new treatment , but they will definitely notice if I show up without one . <p> Brisket cut makes all the difference <p> A brisket glossary <p> The brisket is a roughly rectangular piece of meat located on the lower side of the steer . A whole brisket , trimmed , weighs about 10 pounds , so most butchers separate it into parts according to muscles , or just simply cut it in half . <p> Names used for the cuts of brisket can be confusing . Here are terms you may see at your market . To clarify what the terms actually refer to in your particular market , ask the butcher . <p> Top cut , point cut , deckle cut or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the smaller of the two main cuts , and is thinner , fattier and more flavorful than the flat cut . It is also harder to find . <p> Flat cut or first cut . The inner muscle of the brisket . It is the larger of the two main cuts , and can be as much as 7 pounds . It is thicker , more uniform in shape and leaner than the top cut . This is what most people consider the traditional brisket cut , and is often cut again in two . <p> Flat half . The larger half of the flat cut . It is the part of the flat cut that is most square and uniform in shape . <p> Point half . The smaller half of the flat cut , roughly triangular in shape . <p> Flat , round or first cut . This can be half of the whole brisket , cut through both outer and inner muscles of the brisket .
