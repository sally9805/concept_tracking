<p> Monday , May 14 , 2007 , 11:39 AM <p> Ramadi , Iraq  --  Spc . Keith Martin learned to kill and heal with equal verve . <p> The former Marine pursued his love of medicine in a second military career in the Army and after intensive training , emerged as a " 68 Whiskey , " the designation for a combat medic . <p> Here , deep in the devilish heart of Anbar province , Martin is savior to soldiers in 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry Regiment . <p> Combat medics , affectionately called " docs , " are a special breed of men and women who run instinctively toward guns and bombs , to where blood is flowing . <p> The pace is particularly unforgiving in Ramadi , a stronghold for al-Qaida sympathizers where war 's bloody imprint surfaces daily in brazen bombings , explosions and shootings . Fierce fighting has systematically leveled this city of 400,000 on the banks of the murky Euphrates River . <p> The medic 's motto here : " I love not doing my job . " But few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marines have died in Ramadi ; hundreds of others have been injured . <p> Still , in this 360-degree-angle war that lacks front lines , medics are apparently making a difference . The killed-in-action rate in Iraq is half what it was in World War II and a third less than Vietnam and the Gulf War , according to the Pentagon . <p> But every irreparable injury , every lost life , adds to a young medic 's burden . <p> It surfaces on Martin 's wilted face  --  the 29-year-old Oklahoman has been patching up his brothers in arms since last fall when Colorado-based 1-9 Infantry arrived here . <p> The quiet , introspective father of 4-year-old twins knew that he would be the first line of defense for his company . He came to this war with a bag full of medical supplies . <p> And faith in God . <p> On an overcast day , Martin stands ankle-deep in mud , waiting to make the return journey from central Ramadi to Camp Corregidor a few miles east . <p> In the Humvee , he always positions himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency . Behind him , he keeps his olive drab backpack teeming with supplies . <p> " It 's a lot different in Iraq , " Martin says about a war in which horrific bomb blasts have become the No. 1 killer of U.S. troops . " We have to know procedures and carry equipment to treat severe trauma and hemorrhaging . " <p> Martin trained hard for his job . The Army expected him to have the skills of a second-year medical student after only 16 weeks of class at Fort Sam Houston , Texas . <p> Later , he spent extra hours teaching himself how to slap on tourniquets , coagulating bandages and chest seals . He learned to perform a tracheotomy at lightning speed . And he practiced it all in the dark . Then , a night came when everything he learned was not enough . <p> * * * <p> During a routine trip back to Corregidor , like the one he was about to make today , a makeshift bomb exploded under Martin 's Humvee . The truck 's 600-pound armored door blew off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands . White hot shrapnel seared his neck . <p> " Jesus , Jesus , Jesus ! " Martin cried . <p> He patted himself down , checking to see if everything was intact . He did the same for the gunner , and the driver , and began calling Staff Sgt. Joshua Hager 's name . <p> Hager had been thrown partially out of the Humvee . His right arm and leg were gone . Martin knew  --  from the gushing blood and heavy and irregular breathing  --  that he could do nothing to save Hager . <p> The vow Martin once made to himself , that he would never let a buddy die , was about to become a farce . <p> He wanted to hear screams of pain . He wanted to feel Hager cringe when he bandaged him up . He wanted a chance to save him . <p> That was Martin 's job . No U.S. patrol ever leaves a military base in Iraq without a medic . <p> Combat hospital doctors say it 's vital that a soldier is treated within the first 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platinum 15 , " because massive hemorrhaging kills so many soldiers . If the medic on the field is able to quickly stabilize the bleeding , the soldier then has a " Golden Hour " to get to a hospital for care . <p> The medics know they are there to buy time . <p> " They are the absolute key to success , " says 1st Lt. Ken McKenzie , a trauma nurse in the 28th Combat Hospital in Baghdad . " Without them , we 'd be lost . If you have a heartbeat when you come in through the hospital door , you 're going to go home . " <p> That night , as he watched Hager mouth his last incomprehensible words , Martin was helpless . He watched him die . <p> " I feel cheated . I feel responsible , " Martin says , his head dropping . " It 's a different burden we carry , " he says . <p> * * * <p> Each Army and Marine unit in Ramadi has its own medics and corpsmen who live and fight with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town , Spc . Corey Johnson recalls how his own unit , Task Force 1-77 Armor , lost soldiers . Surrounded by other medics from the Germany-based battalion , Johnson , 25 , sits on the floor , holding his head in his hands . He could not save the lives of two men in his own section : Sgt. Corey Aultz . Sgt. Milton Gist Jr . <p> " And I got two guys who are in the hospital back in the States right now , " Johnson says , sobbing . " You see a lot of death , but the dude that you eat chow with every day , that 's the one you think about . " <p> Silence falls around him . <p> " All you can do is keep your eyes open , " he says after regaining his composure . " Sometimes , that 's not good enough . " Johnson worked as an EMT in Eureka , Calif. , and is now the medic for the battalion commander 's personal security detail in Ramadi . On an ambulance back home , Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make difficult choices . <p> Johnson does n't like playing God . <p> What do you do if you have three guys down and enough supplies in your aid bag to treat only two ? Do you try to save all three with what you have or do you work more comprehensively on two ? Who do you treat first  --  an American or an Iraqi ? <p> " In the heat of the moment , you do what you have to do automatically , " he says . " It 's only afterward that you think about it . <p> " A life is a life , but in the back of our minds are always our guys . " <p> Johnson says he 'd be angry if he depleted his supplies on an Iraqi patient and could not replenish in time to save an American . <p> " My goal here is to make sure all our guys go home to see their families . " <p> In war , the medic 's role as caregiver overflows from the battlefield to the tents and trailers on the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , then medics are the mothers , as Johnson describes it . <p> " I live with these guys . They come to me with cuts , boo-boos and owees , " Johnson says . <p> They confide in him and tell him things they do n't tell anyone else  --  about sexually transmitted diseases or lumps on embarrassing parts of the body . Nightmares . Loneliness . Depression . Suicidal tendencies . <p> " I make sure they are doing OK , " Johnson says . " I know them . I live with them , so I know when something is different . That 's my cue to check for combat stress . " <p> * * * <p> Navy Hospitalman Tristan McCauley , 22 , shares crowded quarters with 1st Battalion , 6th Marines , from Camp LeJeune , N.C. , in a dilapidated low-rise Ramadi school . His bunk is at the end of the first-floor hall , next to a mint-green room that serves as the joint American-Iraqi security station 's clinic . <p> Plaster is peeling off walls damaged by rifle fire and mortar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet holes and cracks around doorways . <p> The young medic from Atlanta recently treated a Marine who suffered a gunshot wound . He could n't tell where the bullet went in or where it came out . He knew he had to stop the bleeding so that the wounded Marine could get on a medical evacuation chopper to one of several combat hospitals in Iraq . His hands , it seemed , went into autopilot . <p> " All I know is that I have to get this guy to a higher level of care , " he says , standing in the stark clinic . <p> McCauley knows when he is facing a femoral artery bleed , time is against him . He laughs at the " Platinum 15 , Golden Hour " mantra . " Fifteen minutes ? You have 120 seconds to get a tourniquet on , or you are going to lose him , " he says . <p> " Some of these guys  --  they are not just your patients , they are your friends , your brothers . When you care for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was growing up , McCauley 's biggest crisis in life was when he " borrowed " his mother 's car from the College Park MARTA parking lot , drove it around without a license and lied about it . Life-and-death decisions were beyond the carefree boy who ran his mouth too much at Riverdale High School . <p> Now he lives with haunting images . <p> A mortar round crashed into the back wall of this joint security station a few months ago and left a fellow corpsman with a gaping hole in his head . <p> McCauley knew the dangers of applying pressure on a head wound . At the same time , he had to stop the blood . All he could do was wrap his head in bandages . His buddy did n't make it . <p> Like all combat medics , McCauley does his own equipment check every time he rolls out into the city . <p> The Marines carry 62 pounds of extra weight in body armor , ammunition , grenades , guns . McCauley has all that  --  and his hefty medical bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I have to know what they do . I could be the only man standing , " he says . <p> * * * <p> More ominous clouds are drifting into Ramadi as 1-9 Infantry soldiers prepare to roll back to their eastern base . <p> Martin , the soldier from Oklahoma City , says every medic prepares for the worst-case scenario . Even now , he is going through all the " what ifs ? " His supplies reflect answers to grim questions . He is a walking clinic . <p> In his right pant leg pocket Martin carries a tourniquet . An Israeli bandage sits in his upper left arm pocket . Packed in his compartmentalized medical backpack are a scalpel , bandages , airways , baby wipes , splints , latex gloves , crinkled gauze , clotting agents and drugs like atropine to calm the wounded . <p> " Here you see a lot of ugly stuff here , " he says . " Stuff you 'll never forget . " <p> Martin has confidence in his abilities . But he no longer has confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When he unzips his backpack , a paperback Bible , sitting right on top , falls out into the mud . He picks it up , wipes it clean . Then , he tucks it back safely  --  with all the other things he relies on every day in Iraq . Photo : LOUIE FAVORITE / AJCSpc .
