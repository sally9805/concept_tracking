Andreas Eschbach was born in Ulm , Germany , in 1959 . He is one of the most acclaimed sf writers to emerge in Germany in the past decade . His novels include Solarstation , Jesus Video , and Kelwitts Stern , all three of which received the Kurd Lasswitz Award for Best Novel . This story , originally published in 1985 , went on to form part of his first novel , Die Haarteppichknupfer ( The Hair Carpet Makers ) , which was published in 1995 . As yet , there are no US editions of his books . <p> NOT AFTER KNOT , DAY IN , day out , for an entire lifetime , always the same hand movements , always looping the same knots in the fine hair , so fine and so tiny that with time the fingers trembled and the eyes became weak from strain - and still the progress was hardly noticeable . When he made good headway in a day , there was a new piece of his carpet perhaps as big as his fingernail . So he squatted before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him had sat , each with the same stooped posture and with the old , filmy magnifying lens before his eyes , his arms propped against the worn breastboard , moving the knotting needle with only the tips of his fingers . Thus he tied knot upon knot as it had been passed down to him for generations until he slipped into a trance in which he felt whole ; his back ceased to hurt and he no longer felt the age in his bones . He listened to the many different sounds of the house which had been built by the grandfather of his great-grandfather - the wind which always slipped over the roof in the same way and was caught in the open windows , the rattling of dishes and the talking of his wives and daughters below in the kitchen . Every sound was familiar . He picked out the voice of the Wise Woman who had been staying in the house the past few days because the confinement of one of his wives , Garliad , was anticipated . He heard the muted doorbell clang , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmuring of the voices . That was probably the peddler woman who was supposed to bring food supplies , textiles and other things today . Then heavy footfalls creaked up the stairs to the carpet tying room . That must be one of the women bringing him his midday meal . Below they would be inviting the peddler woman to table to learn the latest gossip and to let themselves be talked into some bauble or other . He sighed , tightened the knot on which he was working , removed the magnifying lens and turned around . Garliad stood there with her enormous belly and with a steaming plate in her hand , waiting to come in until he gave permission with an impatient gesture . " What are the other women thinking , letting you work in your con. dition ? " he growled . " Do you want to deliver my daughter on the stairs ? " " I feel very well today , Ostvan , " Garliad responded . " Where is my son ? " She hesitated . " I do n't know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ostvan . " In the city ! In that school ! Reading books until his eyes ache and having his head filled with nonsense ! " " He tried to repair the heating and left to get some sort of part .. that 's what he said . " Ostvan hoisted himself up from his stool and took the plate from her hands . " I curse the day I allowed him to go to that school in the city . Was I not blessed by God until then ? Did n't he first give me five daughters and then one son , so that I did not have to kill any of my children ? And do n't my daughters and wives have hair of all colors so that I do not have to dye the hair , and I can tie a carpet which one day will be worthy of the Emperor ? Why can I not succeed in making a good carpetmaker of my son , so that someday I can take my place beside God to help him tie the great carpet of life ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should I not quarrel - with such a son ? I know why his mother did not bring me my food . " " I am supposed to ask you for money to pay the peddler , " said Garliad . " Money ! Always money ! " Ostvan put down the plate on the window sill and shuffled over to a chest with steel fittings , which was decorated with a photograph of the carpet his father had tied . It contained the money which was left from the sale of that carpet , packed in individual boxes , labeled with year numbers . He took out a coin . " Take it . But remember that this must last us for the rest of our lives . " " Yes , Ostvan . " " And when Abron returns , send him immediately to me . " " Yes , Ostvan . " She left . What kind of life was this , nothing but worry and aggravation ! Ostvan pulled a chair up to the window and sat down to eat . His gaze became lost in the rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to look for certain minerals needed to make the secret compounds . He was even in the city several times to buy chemicals or tools . In the meantime he had accumulated everything he would ever need for his carpet . He probably would not go out again . He was no longer young ; his carpet would soon be finished and then it would be time to think about dying . Later , in the afternoon , quick steps on the stairs interrupted his work . It was Abron . " You wanted to speak to me , Father ? " " Were you in the city ? " " I bought sootbrick for the heating . " " We still have sootbrick in the cellar , enough for generations . " " I did n't know . " " You could have asked me . But any excuse to go into the city is. good enough for you . " Unbidden , Abron came closer . " I know it displeases you that I am in the city so often and read books . But I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these other worlds ... there is so much to learn - so many different ways for people to live .... " " I want to hear nothing of it . For you there is only one way to live . You have learned from me everything a hair carpetmaker must know ; that is enough . You can tie all the knots , you have been instructed in impregnation and dying techniques , and you know the traditional patterns . When you have designed your carpet , you will take a wife and have many daughters with different colored hair . And for your wedding , I will cut my carpet from the frame , bind it and present it to you , and you will sell it in the city to the imperial merchant . That is what I did with the carpet of my father , and he did the same before me with the carpet of his father , and he with the carpet of his father , my great-grandfather ; that is the way it has been from generation to generation for thousands of years . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will pay off your debt to your son , and he to his son , and so on . It was always this way and it will always be so . " Abron gave a tortured sigh . " Yes , of course , Father , but I am not happy with this idea . I would rather not be a hair carpetmaker at all . " " I am a carpetmaker and therefore you will also be a carpetmaker ! " With an agitated gesture , Ostvan pointed to the uncompleted carpet in the tying frame . " For my whole life , I have worked on tying this carpet ... my whole life ; and from the profit you will one day eat for your entire life . You have a debt to me , Abron , and I require that you pay off that debt to your own son . And God grant that he will not cause you as much sorrow as you have caused me ! " Abron did not dare look at his father as he replied , " There are rumors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must abdicate .... Who will be able to pay for the hair carpets if the Emperor is gone ? " " The glory of the Emperor will outlast the light of the stars ! " Ostvan said threateningly . " Did n't I teach you that phrase when you could barely sit up next to me at the carpet frame ? Do you imagine that just anybody can come along and change the order of things which was set by God ? " " No , Father , " mumbled Abron , " of course not . " Ostvan watched him . " Now go to work on your carpet design . " " Yes , Father . " Late in the evening Garliad 's birthpangs began . The women accompanied her into the prepared birth room ; Ostvan and Abron stayed in the kitchen . Ostvan got two cups and a bottle of wine , and they drank silently . Sometimes they heard Garliad crying out or moaning in the birth room , then again there was nothing for a while . It was going to be a long night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abron asked , " And if it is a boy ? " " You know as well as I do , " Ostvan responded dully . " Then what will you do ? " " The law has always said that a carpetmaker may only have one son , because a carpet can only support one family . " Ostvan pointed to an old , stain-flecked sword hanging on the wall . " With that my grandfather killed my two brothers on the day of their birth . " Abron was silent . " You said that this is God 's law , " he finally erupted . " That must be a cruel God , do n't you think ? " " Abron ! " Ostvan thundered . " I want to have nothing to do with your God ! " screamed Abron and flung himself out of the kitchen . " Abron ! Stay here ! " But Abron tore up the stairs to the bedchambers and did not return . So Ostvan waited alone , but he did not drink any more . The hours passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of a child were mixed among the cries of the mother , and Ostvan heard the women lamenting and sobbing . He stood up heavily as though every movement were painful ; he took the sword from the wall and laid it on the table . Then he stood there and waited with somber patience until the Wise Woman came from the birth room with the newborn in her arms . " It is a boy , " she said calmly . " Will you kill him , sir ? " Ostvan looked at the rosy , wrinkled face of the child . " No , " he said . " He will live . I want him to be named Ostvan after me . I will teach him the craft of a hair carpetmaker , and should I not live long enough , someone else will complete his training . Take him back to his mother and tell her what I have said . " " Yes , sir , " said the Wise Woman and bore the child out . Ostvan , however , took the sword from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killed his son Abron.
