IT WAS A COOL OCTOBER night in Philadelphia , with a wet wind coming off the river that occasionally shifted to bring in the yeasty spoiled  --  beer smell of the nearby refineries . Independence Stadium , the relatively new South Philly stadium that had been built to replace the old Veteran 's Stadium , which still stood deserted a block or so away , was filled to capacity , and then some , with people standing in the aisles . It was the last game of a hard-fought and bitterly contested World Series between the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies , 3-2 in favor of the Phillies , the Yankees at bat with two out in the top of the ninth inning , and a man on third base . Eduardo Rivera was at bat for the Yankees against pitcher Karl Holzman , the Yankees best slugger against the Phillies ' best stopper , and Holzman had run a full count on Rivera , 3-2 . Everything depended on the next pitch . <p> Holzman went into his slow , deliberate windup . Everybody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . Though there were almost ten thousand people in the stands , nobody was making a sound . Even the TV announcers were tense and silent . Hey , there it is ! The pitch . <p> Some pundits later said that what was about to happen happened because the game was so tight , because so much was riding on the next pitch - that it was the psychic energy of the thousands of fans in the stands , the millions more in the viewing audience at home , every eye and every mind focused on that particular moment . That what happened was caused by the tension and the ever-tightening suspense felt by millions of people hanging on the outcome of that particular pitch .... <p> And yet , in the more than a century and a half that people had been playing professional baseball , there had been many games as important as this one , many contests as closely fought , many situations as tense or tenser , with as much or more passion invested in the outcome - and yet what happened that night had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holzman pitched . The ball left his hand , streaked toward the plate .... <p> And then it froze . <p> The ball just stopped , inches from the plate , and hung there , motionless , in midair . <p> After a second of stunned surprise , Rivera stepped forward and took a mighty hack at the motionless ball . He broke his bat on it , sending splinters flying high . But the ball itself did n't move . <p> The catcher sat back on his butt with a thump , then , after a second , began to scoot backward , away from the plate . He was either praying or cursing in Spanish , perhaps both . Hurriedly , he crossed himself . <p> The home-base umpire , Kellenburger , had been struck dumb with astonishment for a moment , but now he raised his hands to call time . He took his mask off and came a few steps closer to lean forward and peer at the ball , where it hung impossibly in midair . <p> The umpire was the first to actually touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an act either very brave or very foolish , considering the circumstances . " It felt like a baseball , " he later said , letting himself in for a great deal of comic ridicule by late-night talk show hosts , but it really was n't that dumb a remark , again considering the circumstances . It certainly was n't acting like a baseball . <p> He tried to scoop the ball out of the air . It would n't budge . When he took his hand away , there it still was , the ball , hanging motionless a few feet above home plate . <p> The fans in the stadium had been shocked into stunned silence for a few heartbeats . But now a buzzing whisper of reaction began to swell , soon growing into a waterfall roar . No one understood what had happened . But something had happened to stop the game at the most critical possible moment , and nobody liked it . Fistfights were already beginning to break out in the outfield bleachers . <p> Rivera had stepped forward to help Kellenburger tug at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't move it . Holzman , as puzzled as everyone else , walked in to see what in the world was going on . Managers flew out of the dugouts , ready to protest something , although they were n't quite sure what . The rest of the umpires trotted in to take a look . Soon home plate was surrounded by almost everybody who was down on the ballfield , both dugouts emptying , all shouting , arguing , making suggestions , jostling to get a close look at the ball , which hung serenely in midair . <p> Within minutes , fights were breaking out on the field as well . The stadium cops were already having trouble trying to quell disturbances in the seats , where a full-fledged riot was brewing . They could n't handle it . The fans began tearing up the seats , trampling each other in panicked or angry surges , pouring out on to the field to join in fistfights with the players . The city cops had to be called in , then more cops , then the riot squad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outraged fans out with tear gas and rubber bullets . Dozens of people were injured , some moderately seriously , but , by some other miracle , none were killed . Dozens of people were arrested , including some of the players and the manager of the Yankees . The stadium was seriously trashed . By the time the umpires got around to officially calling the game , it had become clear a long time before that World Series or no World Series , no game was going to be played in Independence Stadium that night , or , considering the damage that had been done to the bleachers , probably for many nights to come . <p> Finally , the last ambulance left , and the remaining players and grounds crew and assorted team personnel were herded out , still complaining and arguing . After a hurried conference between the police and the owners , the gates were locked behind them . <p> The ball still hung there , not moving . In the empty stadium , gleaming white under the lights , it somehow looked even more uncanny than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left behind to keep an eye on it , but the sight spooked them , and they stayed as far away from it as they could without leaving the infield , checking it every few minutes as the long night crept slowly past . But the ball did n't seem to be going anywhere . <p> Most of the riot had been covered live across the nation , of course , television cameras continuing to roll as fans and players beat each other bloody , while the sportscasters provided hysterical commentary ( and barricaded the doors of the press room ) . Reporters from local stations had been there within twenty minutes , but nobody knew quite how to handle the event that had sparked the riot in the first place ; most ignored it , while others treated it as a Silly Season item . The reporters were back the next morning , though , some of them , anyway , as the owners and the grounds crew , more cops , the Commissioner of Baseball , and some Concerned City Hall Bigwigs went back into the stadium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of morning , which is supposed to chase all fancies away and dissolve all troubling fantasms , the ball was still frozen there in midair , motionless , exactly the same way it had been the night before . It looked even spookier though , more bewilderingly inexplicable , under the ordinary light of day than it had looked under the garish artificial lighting the night before . This was no trick of the eyes , no confusion of light and shadow . Although it could n't be , the goddamn thing was there . <p> The grounds crew did everything that they could think of to get the ball to move , including tying a rope around it and having a dozen hefty men yank and heave and strain at it , their feet scrambling for purchase , as if they were playing tug-of-war with Mighty Joe Young and losing , but they could no more move the ball than Kellenburger had been able to the night before . <p> It was becoming clear that it might be a long time before another game could be played in Independence Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest baseball circles , Yankee Stadium was borrowed to restage the potential final out of the series . Thousands of fans in the stadium ( who had paid heretofore unheard-of prices for tickets ) and millions of television viewers watched breathlessly as Holzman went into his windup and delivered the ball to the plate at a respectable ninety-five miles-per-hour . But nothing happened except that Rivera took a big swing at the ball and missed . No miracle . The ball thumped solidly into the catcher 's mitt ( who 'd had to be threatened with heavy sanctions to get him to play , and who had a crucifix , a St. Christopher 's medal , and an evil-eye-warding set of horns hung around his neck ) . Kellenburger , the home-plate umpire , pumped his fist and roared " You 're out ! " in a decisive , no-nonsense tone . And that was that . The Philadelphia Phillies had won the World Series . <p> The fans tore up the seats . Parts of New York City burned . The riots were still going on the following afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason anyone could see ; perhaps they were sympathy riots ) in Cincinnati . <p> After another emergency session , the Commissioner announced that entire last game would be replayed , in the interests of fairness . This time , the Yankees won , 7-5 . <p> After more rioting , the Commissioner evoked special executive powers that no one was quite sure he had , and declared that the Series was a draw . This satisfied nobody , but eventually fans stopped burning down bits of various cities , and the situation quieted . <p> The bizarre result went into the record books , and baseball tried to put the whole thing behind it . <p> In the larger world outside the insular universe of baseball , things were n't quite that simple . <p> Dozens of newspapers across the country had independently - and perhaps inevitably - come up with the headline HANGING CURVE BALL ! ! ! , screamed across the front page in the largest type they could muster . A novelty song of the same name was in stores within four days of the Event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody knows for sure how long it took for the first Miracle Ball joke to appear , but they were certainly circulating widely by as early as the following morning , when the strange non-ending of the World Series was the hot topic of discussion in most of the workplaces and homes in America ( and , indeed , around the world ) , even those homes where baseball had rarely - if ever - been discussed before . <p> Media hysteria about the Miracle Ball continued to build throughout the circus of replaying the World Series ; outside of sports circles , where the talk tended to center around the dolorous affect all this was having on baseball , the focus was on the Miracle itself , and what it might - or might not - signify . Hundreds of conspiracy-oriented internet sites , of various degrees of lunacy , appeared almost overnight . Apocalyptic religious cults sprang up almost as fast as wacko internet sites . The Miracle was widely taken as a Sign that the Last Days were at hand , as nearly anything out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face on a taco , for the last thousand years . Within days , some people in California had sold their houses and all their worldly possessions and had begun walking barefoot toward Philadelphia . <p> After the **35;781;TOOLONG theory , the second most popular theory , and the one with the most internet sites devoted to it , was that Aliens had done it - although as nobody ever came up with an even remotely convincing reason why aliens would want to do this , that theory tended to run out of gas early , and never was as popular as the Apocalypse Now/Sign from the Lord theory . The respectable press tended to ridicule both of these theories has well as the Sinister Government Conspiracy theory , a dark horse , but popular in places like Montana and Utah ) - still , it was hard for even the most determined skeptic to deny that something was going on that no one could even begin to explain , something that defied the laws of physics as we thought we knew them , and more than one scientist , press-ganged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venues , burbled that if we could learn to understand the strange cosmic forces , whatever they were , that were making the Ball act as it was acting , whole new sciences would open up , and Mankind 's technological expertise could be advanced a thousand years . <p> Up until this point , the government had been ignoring the whole thing , obviously not taking it seriously , but now , perhaps jolted into action by watching scientists on The Tonight Show enthuse about the wondrous new technologies that might be there for the taking , they made up for lost time ( and gave a boost to the Sinister Government Conspiracy theory ) by swooping down and seizing Independence Stadium , excluding all civilians from the property . <p> The city and the owners protested , then threatened to sue , but the feds smacked them with Eminent Domain and stood pat eventually they would be placated by the offer to build a new stadium elsewhere in the city , at government expense ; since you certainly could n't play a game in the Independence Stadium anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not really all that hard to convince ) . Hordes of scientists and spooks from various alphabet-soup agencies swarmed over the playing field . A ring of soldiers surrounded the stadium day and night , military helicopters hovered constantly overhead to keep other helicopters with prying television cameras away , and when it occurred to somebody that this would n't be enough to frustrate spy satellites or high-flying spy planes , a huge tent enclosure was raised over the entire infield , hiding the Ball from sight . <p> Months went by , then years . No news about the Miracle Baseball was coming out of Independence Stadium , although by now a tent city had been raised in the surrounding parking lots to house the influx of government-employed scientists , who were kept in strict isolation . Occasionally , a fuss would be made in the media or a motion would be raised in Congress in protest of such stringent secrecy , but the government was keeping the lid down tight , in spite of wildfire rumors that scientists were conferring with UFO Aliens in there , or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultists , who had been refused admittance to Independence Stadium to venerate the Ball , when they 'd arrived with blistered and bleeding feet from California several months after the Event , erected a tent city of their own across the street from the government 's tent city , and could be seen keeping vigil day and night in all weathers , as if they expected God to pop his head out of the stadium to say hello at any moment , and did n't want to miss it . ( They eventually filed suit against the government for interfering with their freedom to worship by refusing them access to the Ball , and the suit dragged through the courts for years , with no conclusive results . ) <p> The lack of information coming out of Independence Stadium did nothing to discourage media speculation , of course . In fact , it was like pouring gasoline on a fire , and for several years it was difficult to turn on a television set at any time of the day or night without finding somebody saying something about the Miracle Ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the players and officials who were down on the field When It Happened became minor media celebrities , and did the rounds of all the talk shows . Rivera , the batter who 'd been at the plate that night , refused to talk about it , seeming bitter and angry about the whole thing - the joke was that Rivera was pissed because God had been scared to pitch to him - but Holzman , the pitcher , showed an unexpected philosophical bent - pitchers were all head-cases anyway , baseball fans told each other - and was a fixture on the talk show circuit for years , long after he 'd retired from the game . " I 'm not sure it proves the existence of God , " he said one night . " You 'd think that God would have better things to do . But it sure shows that there are forces at work in the universe we do n't understand . " Later , on another talk show , discussing the theory that heavenly intervention had kept his team from winning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , maybe God is a Yankees fan - but if He hates the Phillies all that much , would n't it have been a lot easier just to let Rivera get a hit ? " <p> In the second year after the Event , a book called Schrodinger 's Baseball , written by a young Harvard physicist , postulated the theory that those watching the game in the stadium that night had been so evenly split between Yankees fans wanting Rivera to get a hit and Phillies fans wanting him to strike out , the balance so exquisitely perfect between the two opposing pools of observers , that the quantum wave function had been unable to " decide " which way to collapse , and so had just frozen permanently into an indeterminate state , not resolving itself into either outcome . This was immediately derided as errant nonsense by other scientists , but the book became an international bestseller of epic proportions , staying at the top of the lists for twenty months , and , although it had no plot at all , was later optioned for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-figure advance . <p> Eventually , more than four years later , after an election where public dislike of the Secret of Independence Stadium had played a decisive role , a new administration took charge and belatedly declared an Open Door policy , welcoming in civilian scientists , even those from other nations , and , of course , the media . <p> As soon became clear , they had little to lose . Nothing had changed in almost half a decade . The Ball still hung there in midair . Nothing could move it . Nothing could affect it . The government scientists had tried taking core samples , but no drill bit would bite . They 'd tried dragging it away with tractor-hauled nets and with immense magnetic fields , and neither the brute-force nor the high-tech approach had worked . They 'd measured it and the surrounding space and the space above and below it with every instrument anybody could think of , and discovered nothing . They 'd hit it with high-intensity laser beams , they 'd tried crisping it with plasma and with flame-throwers , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing had worked . <p> They 'd learned nothing from the Ball , in spite of years of intensive , round-the-clock observation with every possible instrumentation , in spite of hundreds of millions of dollars spent , in spite of dozens of scientists working themselves into nervous exhaustion , mental breakdowns , and emotional collapse . No alien secrets . No heretofore unexpected forces of nature ( none that they 'd learned to identify and control , anyway ) . The Ball was just there . Who knew why ? Or how ? <p> More years of intensive investigation by scientists from around the world followed , but eventually , as years stretched into decades , even the scientists began to lose interest . Most ordinary people had lost interest long before , when the Miracle Ball resolutely refused to do anything else remarkable , or even moderately non-boring . <p> Baseball the sport did its best to pretend the whole thing had never happened . Game attendance had soared for a while , as people waited for the same thing to happen again , then , when it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major-league franchises went out of business ( although , oddly , sandlot and minor-league games were as popular as ever ) , and those who were lucky enough to survive did their best to see that the Ball was rarely mentioned in the sports pages . <p> Other seasons went into the record books , none tainted by the miraculous . <p> Forty more years went by . <p> Frederick Kellenburger had not been a young man even when he officiated at home plate during the Event . Now he was fabulously old , many decades into his retirement , and had chosen to spend the remaining few years of his life living in a crumbling old brownstone building in what remained of a South Philadelphia neighborhood , a couple of blocks from Independence Stadium . In the last few years , almost against his will , since he had spent decades resolutely trying to put the whole business behind him , he had become fascinated with the Event , with the Ball - in a mellow , non-obsessive kind of way , since he was of a calm , phlegmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve any mysteries , where so many others had failed . Still , he had nothing better to do with the residue of his life , and as almost everybody else who had been involved with the Event was dead by now , or else tucked away in nursing homes , it seemed appropriate somehow that someone who had been there from the start should keep an eye on the Ball . <p> He spent the long , sleepless nights of extreme old age on his newly acquired ( only twenty years old ) hobby of studying the letters and journals of the Knights of St. John of twelfth-century Rhodes , a hobby that appealed to him in part just because it was so out of character for a retired baseball umpire , and an area in which , to everyone 's surprise - including his own - he had become an internationally recognized authority . Days , he would pick up a lightweight cloth folding chair , and hobble the few blocks to Independence Stadium , moving very , very slowly , like an ancient tortoise hitching itself along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , even if he 'd been capable of it . This neighborhood had been nearly deserted for years . There was no traffic , rarely anybody around . The slowly rising Atlantic lapped against the base of the immense Jersey Dike a few blocks to the east , and most of the buildings here were abandoned , boarded-up , falling down . Weeds grew through cracks in the middle of the street . For decades now , the city had been gradually , painfully , ponderously shifting itself to higher ground to the west , as had all the other cities of the slowly foundering East Coast , and few people were left in this neighborhood except squatters , refugees from Camden and Atlantic City who could afford nothing better , and a few stubborn South Philly Italians almost as old as he was , who 'd been born here and were refusing to leave . No one paid any attention to an old man inching his way down the street . No one bothered him . It was oddly peaceful . <p> Independence Stadium itself was half-ruined , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . There was a towheaded , lazily smiling young boy with an old and probably non-functional assault rifle who was supposed to keep people out of the Stadium , but Kellenburger bribed him with a few small coins every few days , and he always winked and looked the other way . There were supposed to be cameras continuously running , focused on the Ball , part of an ongoing study funded by the University of Denver , recording everything just in case something ever happened , but the equipment had broken down long since , and nobody had seemed to notice , or care . The young guard never entered the Stadium , so , once inside , Kellenburger had the place pretty much to himself . <p> Inside , Kellenburger would set up his folding chair behind the faded outline of home plate , right where he used to stand to call the games , sit down in the dappled sunlight ( the tent enclosing the infield had long since fallen down , leaving only a few metal girders and a few scraps of fabric that flapped lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which still hung motionless in the air , just as it had for almost fifty years now . He did n't expect to see anything , other than what had always been there to be seen . It was quiet inside the abandoned stadium , though , and peaceful . Bees buzzed by his ears , and birds flew in and out of the stadium , squabbling under the eaves , making their nests in amongst the broken seats , occasionally launching into liquid song . The air was thick with the rich smells of morning-glory and honeysuckle , which twined up around the ruined bleachers . Wildflowers had sprung up everywhere , and occasionally the tall grass in the outfield would rustle as some small unseen creature scurried through it . Kellenburger watched the Ball , his mind comfortably blank . Sometimes - more often than not , truth be told - he dozed and nodded in the honeyed sunlight . <p> As chance would have it , he happened to be awake and watching when the Ball moved at last . <p> Without warning , the Ball suddenly shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown it only a second before , rather than nearly half a century in the past . With no catcher there to intercept it , it shot past home plate , hit the back wall , bounced high in the air , fell back to Earth , bounced again , rolled away , and disappeared into the tall weeds near what had once been the dugout . <p> After a moment of silent surprise , Kellenburger rose stiffly to his feet . Ponderously , he shuffled forward , bent over as much as he could , tilted his head creakingly this way and that , remembering the direction of the ball as it shot over the faded ghost of home plate , analyzing , judging angles . At last , slowly , he smiled . <p> " Strike ! " he said , with satisfaction . " I knew it would be . You 're out . " Then , without a backward look , without even a glance at where the famous Ball lay swallowed in the weeds , he picked up his folding chair , hoisted it to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , moving very slowly , shuffled home along the cracked and deserted street through the warm , bright , velvet air of spring . <p> Author Affiliation
