WE DRAGGED OUR BACKSIDES into the clubhouse after losing 3 to ? to the Tigers . It 's awful losing out of town ; you do n't even want to go to dinner . And we had n't won in a long time . Coach Ketchum came in and stood in the middle of the locker room . It was so quiet you could hear the buttons of Manley 's jersey rolling around the floor . Our first baseman tore his shirt off every time we lost . We all knew what Ketchum was going to say . " Eighteen ! " he called out . He left it in the air like a verdict . <p> The way you know you 're in a slump is that you leave base runners . You have a chance and then another chance and then another chance , and after a few weeks of all these chances that only add up to losses , you know . The other club is n't beating you-you 're losing . Eighteen in a row . It 's a slump . <p> The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always loved the papers , to start the day reading about all of it , some double play I turned with Gadroll or a clutch hit . It was about us in a good way , every other day my name in the paper on a team with a shot at the playoffs . Now we 'd lost eighteen straight and we 'd left two hundred of us on base , and this was a bona fide , blue chip , major league slump . <p> Ketchum threw his clipboard against the far wall , grabbed his clothes in a bunch , and left . He 'd go back to the hotel and change ; he was sick of us . And I was a little sick , too . After running the count full three times , I 'd struck out three times , and then fouled out behind first to end the game . <p> " What 's happening ? " Esteban asked . He was standing in his towel , and no one else had even taken their socks off . " What 's happening to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Manley said . " Remember ? It happened last night and the night before .... " <p> " No , " Corazon said . He had a stripe of grass stain from his shoulder to his hip where he 'd dived for a liner in deep short . " We failed . We are allowing insufficient moments to gather over us on the field of play . " <p> Everyone looked at him . The Professor we called him , because of the English he 'd learned from a thesaurus when he was in Triple A. <p> " What can we do ? " Gadroll asked . " I 'm in the batting cage every spare minute . It is n't practice . " <p> That was when Hazzerly , our catcher and the oldest guy on the squad , stood up and said , " We need a slump buster . " <p> " You got that right , " Manley said . He had pulled his shoes off without untying them and was pulling off his socks . " How much are they ? " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No team I 've ever played for lost eighteen straight . " He was a twenty-year veteran and had been on four teams in each league . " This is serious business . " <p> " OK . " Gadroll pointed at him . " A slump buster , sounds good . What is it ? " <p> Hazzerly had Esteban help him drag in the visiting cooler and threw everyone a bottle of Old Pelican Lager while he put a foot up on the bench and explained it . " We need someone to take one for the team , " he said . " We need a volunteer . " He tipped his bottle up and took a drink . " And it has to be one of the single guys . " <p> When I heard that , I felt a little shock and looked over at Corazon and Gadroll . There were only three of us . And when he said the rest , I knew I was in it up to my neck . <p> A slump buster goes out and finds a girl , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to stop a clock-and he nails her . " The full deed , " Hazzerly finished . " Not just getting to first base or second base or third . It 's got to be a home run . And boys , we need it to happen before Friday . " <p> " I 'll do it ! " Manley called out . Now he was standing in his jock , having torn his pants off . " I 'll do it twice . " <p> " No way , " Hazzerly said . " You 're married . It has to be one of these single guys . " <p> " Manley 's girlfriends are dogs , though , " Esteban said . Manley had a couple girls in every town . It was amazing . There must have been plenty of women who liked having their clothes ripped off . I never saw him work a button in three seasons . <p> " We 've got to vote , " Hazzerly said . " It 's Gadroll or Durrant . " <p> " What about Corazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife in San Juan . " <p> " It is the great benefit of my life to have marital affection for two years now , " Corazon said , lifting his bottle in a toast . <p> " Let 's vote , " Esteban said . <p> Gadroll had his hand in the air and Hazzerly nodded at him . " Yes ? " <p> " Boys , I 'm engaged . No joke . Since May , our homestand against the Mariners . " <p> " You 're not engaged , " I said to him . <p> " I swear I am , " and he lifted his hand . <p> " Put your hand down , " I told him . My teammates all looked at me there in the visiting clubhouse . " I 'm no good with women , " I told them . " I have n't had a girlfriend since high school , and I 'm even lying about that . We were debate partners . " No one commented . " You actually think this works ? " <p> Hazzerly stepped toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole team . Everyone sat still . " Yeah , Danny , it works . When I was with the Athletics , we lost eleven in a row by two runs or less . We were dead in the water , and then they sent me out to bust the slump . This was a long time ago . I went right over to Dayfair , the department store , and made a friend at the cosmetics counter , a tall woman in a white coat . Think of me in a cosmetics department .... " <p> A few of the guys smiled , and Hazzerly pointed around the room erasing each smile as he went . " I was willing to take one for the team . This tall woman looked like Howard Cosell with long stringy hair . She was perfect . Eventually we went back to the hotel and got that coat off . I bought her breakfast the next morning . She never knew I was a ballplayer , and I never saw her again . " <p> " Then you guys went to the play-offs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazzerly was whispering . " We went on to the play-offs . I took one for the team . " Now he was looking at me . <p> " OK , " I said , and I lifted my bottle in a sad toast . " I 'll bust the slump . " <p> At ten that night in the Blue Garden , the funky lounge inside the Greenbriar hotel , I saw her . I was sitting with Gadroll and Corazon , and I 'd asked Corazon what his wife 's name was . <p> " Corina , " he said . <p> " Is she Puerto Rican ? " I asked him . <p> " She is derived from the island nation of Cuba , " he said . " Her father 's brother owns the clothes laundry house in my town , and to my gigantic joy , she has met me in that place for acquaintanceship and matrimony . " <p> " And you 're allegedly engaged to Sheila ? " I said , shaking the ice in my glass at Gadroll . <p> " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring ? " <p> " Seriously , there 's a ring . " <p> " Where did you buy it ? " <p> Corazon jumped in , " I gave my betrothed a paper scroll of my intentions , a single pearl necklace , an engagement ring of diamond constructions , and then a five-carat ring at our wedding ceremony after my contractual baseball paperwork was officialized and accompanied by the proper monies . " <p> The Blue Garden waiter came by and Gadroll ordered another round . We were drinking Rooftop bourbon on the rocks . <p> " I got it downtown at Mednick 's . " <p> I just looked at Gadroll . That is when I saw her , a large girl with a blond bowl cut sitting at one of the low Blue Garden tables behind him . There were three girls , all large , severe haircuts . They were drinking Madcap Ale , and there were six or seven bottles on the table along with their three pilsner glasses , half full . <p> Old Hazzerly was at the bar and I went over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked him . We talked like two guys on the mound , not looking at each other . " The three beer drinkers . " I stood still looking at my chumpy face in the bar mirror . Half hidden behind the line of bottles , I looked like a monster unsure he was ready to attack the city . <p> Hazzerly said to me : " Absolutely . Their faces wont stop the clock , but their shoulders would stop a train . Get on it . " <p> So , this was all new territory for Danny Durrant , slump buster , but I went in . I picked up my fresh drink from Gadroll and Corazon and wished them good night . Corazon whispered to me , " Be careful . They 're sizable . " I drifted over to the trio of young women . When I stood above them they stopped talking , looked up and smiled . They all had name tags with blue borders , and so I said , " Are you here for the conference ? " <p> " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento . " <p> Then I put my hand on the back of the fourth chair , and the blond opened her hand as she pointed at it , so I joined their table . Here we go , I thought . If it 's all hand signals , I 'll be OK . I never missed a sign in three years in the majors , but this did feel like it might be a new game . I did n't dare turn to check my buddies ; I had taken the plunge . <p> The three were gabbers , excited to be in Motor City . That 's what they kept calling it . Had I been to the Henry Ford Museum ? Had I been on the People Mover ? I think they assumed I was with their conference , which I gathered was about the Junior League and a Charity Ball . I looked at them and they were n't particularly bad looking , just big , sort of , and their hair was too short , but the blond when she smiled had a bright face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought them all a round of Madcap and then another , and while I was figuring out how to get Clare alone , the two others , Jane and Susan , stood up and back-stepping with a flurry of hand signals were gone . <p> Clare looked down at the table , and I watched her face blush , the red emerging oddly the way the crowd in centerfield changes when they all stand up . She looked at me quickly and then away , and the redness doubled . " What is it ? " I asked . <p> " We never meet men , " she said to me . <p> " Come on . Do n't pull my leg , " I said . <p> " No , we talk about it , but we do n't meet any . Everybody 's hoping Jane and I will meet somebody , but we do n't . Susan has a boyfriend in Sacramento , but we ... " <p> " I 'm surprised . " <p> " Susan said that any man we would meet in here would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you married , Dan ? " <p> " No , " I said , and for the first time all day I was glad for that answer . " I am definitely not married . " <p> " Why did you come over to our table ? Susan said that any man who came over to our table would be a married man . " <p> " Actually , " I said , and this was easy because it was true , " I saw you . I 've never come over to a table of ladies before in my life . " I loved being with her and telling the truth . " And , Clare , " I raised my right hand , " I am not married , engaged , or even in a minor dating schedule . " <p> Her smile was pure relief , and it lit up the Blue Garden for me . There was a sliver of water in her eyes . She leaned over and put her hand on my forearm , a touch that also brightened things , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded with empty Madcap bottles . <p> The barman came over and started gathering them up . " Last call , " he said . <p> This , of course , is when Manley came by . He 'd gone out with one of his girlfriends , and when she 'd dropped him back at the Greenbriar , he swung by the bar . When I saw him coming , I looked to the bar for help , but Hazzerly was gone . Corazon and Gadroll had also folded . <p> " Hey , boy , " Manley said , putting his meaty hand on my shoulder . " Looks like you got just a touch more woman here than you can handle . " <p> Clare stood , alarmed . <p> " It 's OK , " I told her . " I know this guy . " <p> " Maybe this gal would like the company of a real man , " he went on . <p> " No , " Clare said , pulling my arm to her and clutching it . " I 'm happy with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out of the Blue Garden ahead of Manley , who was concerned now with getting a last drink before the bar shut down . <p> We found ourselves across the marble lobby of the Greenbriar by the elevators , having pushed the UP button , and we both watched the lighted numbers descend like a ticking clock . I said what was in my idiot mind : " Are you staying here ? " <p> The empty elevator door opened and we stood looking in . " Yes , " she said seriously , " I am . " She stepped first into the elevator and reached back and took my hand and brought me aboard . She pushed the 7 button , and when the door closed , she turned to me and put her strong arms around me and we kissed . She whispered into my shoulder . " I 'm staying here and I have a single room , and we are not going to think about any of this , except you came over to my table and you are not married . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I had n't been kissed for a long time and I never had been kissed in an elevator , but I rode the kiss seven floors . We walked the carpeted hallway to her room and my heart was beating . <p> Inside she lit one lamp and we undressed carefully . I told her I knew a guy who tore every button off his shirt when he took it off , and she said she would n't care to meet such a barbarian . I told her I knew a guy who called marriage matrimony and who spoke so formally that it changed the way you spoke back to him , and she said it must be wonderful to work with resourceful people . By then , in that conversation , I was naked and she was naked , the bed between us like the secret in my heart , and I considered telling Clare about the slump buster and how this started as a dare but now it was something else indeed . But before I could adequately consider this and decide anything at all , I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . <p> Clare was big and she was strong , muscular , in thrilling ways , and I was not interested in sleeping . We must have slept , but I do not remember it . In the gray dawn we drank bottled water from her room fridge and then we readdressed ourselves to our acquaintance , as Corazon would have put it , though I did not think of him or of the team at all . <p> In the true light of morning Clare came out of the bathroom in her robe , her scrubbed face bright , and said she 'd already ordered room service . " I like a big breakfast , Danny , " she said . This made me ridiculously happy . When it arrived , we tore through it like no breakfast I had ever known , until at last I was dunking my rye toast in the coffee and she was getting dressed . She opened the curtains and breathed a deep breath . It felt a lot like something beginning . <p> I told her that I would meet her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have a drink , then go off somewhere to dinner . I told her I had something to tell her . We kissed against the door of her room , and I ran my hand up into her terrific short blond hair . <p> In the clubhouse , everyone was , " What happened ? What happened ? " I just looked them all , even Manley , in the eye , and said , " Let 's go out there and play ball . " Esteban led off that afternoon and hit the first pitch of the ball game into the second level in deep left field . We never looked back , beating Detroit 9 to 0 , no men left on base . <p> The ESPN guy who had n't been in our dugout in three weeks came down for a while and said to Hazzerly , " Its like a new team . " <p> Hazzerly looked at me and said , " It is . " <p> I got clapped on the back quite a bit , and guys were calling out , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Corazon came over and said , " Your efforts in our behalf have created a changing beneficial result . I am pleased to offer you my gigantic congratulations with many more to come . " <p> But that night in the Blue Garden , Clare never showed up . Everybody on the team came by my table there and bought me a drink . I had a line of Rooftop shots that stretched across the table like a train . I had a stack of all the evening papers . We were back in the papers and happy to read about it . At ten I went to the hotel desk and found that Clare had checked out . I asked after her particulars , and of course , they would not give out any information . <p> It was Gadroll who found her . Just before midnight , when I had drunk myself halfway across the table , Gadroll slapped the paper and said , " Look at this . " I thought he was going to show me the nice picture of me half in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . But what he had was on the inside page . <p> It was Clare , and she was on the shoulders of Jane and Susan and five or six other women in white baseball uniforms : the Sacramento Bears . They 'd won the national charity tournament . The article emphasized that their victory was quite a surprise because they had been in a chronic , depressing slump . They quoted Clare at the end . She said , " Slumps are tough . Make no mistake . When you 're in one , you 've got to find a way , any way you can , to bust out of it . " <p> Author Affiliation
