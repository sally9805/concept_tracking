West March , England , 1542 , 60 years later ... The litter , piled high with pillows and blankets , creaked and swayed as the horses made their way inexorably west to Lochnith and Fayth Graham 's betrothed , Lord Ashton Carlisle . It was late September and the weather was mild ; even so , Fayth sweat , stifled by the closed curtains of her litter . But they shielded her from the sight of the heavily armed guard surrounding her . The guards were more than protection . They ensured she 'd not escape her fate . Fayth leaned back against the pillows , loosening the laces of her bodice , untying the throat of the linen shift and spreading it wide . But that brought no relief . The air was thick . The stench of unwashed men and horse sweat permeated the heavy brocaded curtains . She was accustomed to the smell , if not to the elaborate garments her brother dressed her in . Since she was a bairn she 'd dressed as a lad to train with her father and brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and no stays . The tightly laced wooden busks choked her and limited her range of movement . They scraped the healing stripes across her back , courtesy of her oldest brother , Ridley . He 'd tried to flog her into agreeing to wed Carlisle . As of the present , he 'd still not obtained her acquiescence . But apparently it no longer mattered . Unable to bear another moment of inaction , Fayth parted the curtains slightly and peered through . A wall of armor-clad muscle and horseflesh surrounded her . Yet that did not deter her . She must escape . The alternative  --  marriage to a cruel old man  --  was unthinkable . Mona had warned herwhat her life would be like if she was n't able to extricate herself from this marriage . Fayth shook her head , angry , frustrated , refusing to accept her fate , even as she moved toward it . This was not how her life was supposed to be ! Before Papa died there had been love , joy , friendship , family . Now there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing the memories away . Nothing would be gained by dwelling on what could not be changed ... for now . But there was still hope ... there was always hope . Behind her eyelids new images spun . Fire eating through tapestry and flowers , blood spilling , bodies twisting in agony . Fayth 's head jerked , as if to flick away the visions like an insect , but they gripped her . She did n't want to remember what she 'd done  --  the pain and horror she 'd caused . Caroline screamed and screamed . Arms imprisoned Fayth , stifling , suffocating . Fayth fought his embrace , struggled for air as he squeezed . But he was too strong for her . Enough . Jaw clenched with new resolve , she pushed the errant memories away and peered through the slit in the brocade . The guard beside her was preoccupied , his helm-covered head at an anxious tilt , scanning the surrounding trees . Fayth 's gaze tipped upward . Sunlight streamed through the branches like shafts of gold . They were in a forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests and bogs , so she could n't be sure exactly where they were or how much farther until Lord Carlisle 's castle of Lochnith . She searched the trees , looking for a means of quick escape . A glimpse of something in the trees above caught her eye . A glint of metal ? Or her imagination , weaving her desperate hope for rescue into fanciful visions ? She strained her eyes , but could discern nothing . She parted the curtains further , easing her head out . There were men before and behind the litter , but no one paid overmuch attention to her . Fayth wished fervently for a pair of breeches and a tunic . A cap to pull low over her hair and eyes . But alas , she would make do with gem encrusted velvet and ribbons . She would have to be fast , there was no room for hesitation or misstep . Someone shouted at the head of the cavalcade . The guard beside her tapped his horse 's side and the horse stepped it up a bit , prancing forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fayth paid no attention to the yelling  --  the guard was in front of her now . She slid out of the litter , her feet dangling over the ground , and jumped . She rolled away , so the horse bearing the litter from behind did n't trample her , wooden stays digging furrows into her hips , and leaped to her feet . She was spotted immediately . " She 's escaped ! Mistress Graham has escaped ! " The nearest guard yanked on his mount 's reins , trying to turn sharply . The horse fought , rearing onto its haunches . Fayth darted into the trees . The clank of metal followed as her brother 's knights dismounted to give pursuit . Fayth tried not to panic  --  she had no idea where she was going . Well , she did  --  she was returning to England , to the village her father had kidnapped her stepmother , Mona , from  --  but currently , she was lost . Stones and sharp twigs pierced her feet through her delicate silk slippers . Damn , what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding of feet grew distant and Fayth chanced stopping to get her bearings . She leaned against a tree , her breath heaving in her chest . She could barely hear anything over the pounding of her heart , the roar of blood in her ears . She placed a lace-gloved hand over her chest , closed her eyes , and inhaled deeply , willing calm to settle over her . She could n't think in such a panic . After several such deep breaths her heart began to slow . The breaking of a twig and the soft crunch of leaves behind her set it hammering all over again as she whirled around . But it was n't her brother or his knights behind her . It was something far worse . Her throat closed and she could n't speak  --  could only stare into the terrifyingly familiar face . " Red " Alex Maxwell smiled , a cold curve of his lips that did n't reach the frigid blue eyes . " I 've been following ye since ye left Graham Keep , but never did I think ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you following me ? The horrified words formed in her head , but her voice was lodged somewhere in her chest , all tangled up with her furiously beating heart . He wore no helm or cap , his dark reddish brown hair caught at the nape of his neck , holding it away from his face . Her eyes slid over the strong boned face to his temple . The red scar stood out , twisted and ugly . She 'd given him that mark , slammed a jug of whisky over his head . Jesus wept , why had n't she killed him ? He 'd murdered her betrothed ! He 'd ruined her life ! Why had she lost courage ? Had she the daring then , she would n't be standing here , caught between two enemies . She would be racing to freedom . His utter stillness broke and he advanced . Fayth 's paralysis gave way to terror . He would not be tricked again . He would rape and murder her this time  --  and from the grim determination etched on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run  --  forgetting there was a tree at her back . She smacked into it and stumbled backward . He caught her arm , swinging her around . Fayth had n't spent half her life training with men for naught . Before he could catch her other arm , she ducked , grasping the dirk hilt that peeked from the top of his boot . He reacted quickly to stop her , but she wedged the blade between them , pressing the tip to his leather-and mail-clad belly . A foolish act . She had n't the strength to penetrate his armor . The top of her head barely reached his shoulder . But there was little else she could do . He knew it well . He grabbed her other arm with his huge hand and yanked her hard against him . The blade skidded off the leather , pinning her hand and the blade between them . She could taste her own fear as the scent of him surrounded her . Leather , sweat , and the faint fragrance of soap . He would kill her now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to her own sister , whom he now claimed as kin . Her body chilled with abhorrence , wondering if he would kiss her again . Like he did at Annancreag ... " Fayth ! " Fayth 's head jerked around . Her brothers were near . They would rescue her from Red Alex . Then what ? Take her to her old man husband . She looked up at her captor . He stared over her head , in the direction of the voices . His gaze dropped swiftly to hers , his hand sliding between their bodies and grasping her wrist . He forced the dirk from her hand and slid it back into his boot . Securing both her wrists in one hand , he dragged her deeper into the trees . Fayth dug in her heels and fought him . He was so huge and she was so small . An amused smile split his face . " Och , ye want to be carried , eh ? " Fayth shook her head frantically , but it was too late , he tossed her over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire body seemed to be formed from granite . A scream lodged in her throat . Perhaps Ashton Carlisle was n't so bad ? So he was a cruel old man ? So he had sick lusts ? He might die soon , leaving her a rich widow . Compared to whatever abomination Red Alex had planned for her , that seemed quite satisfactory . And suddenly , decision made , she grabbed the long auburn hair trailing down his back and yanked as hard as she could as she let loose a shriek that resounded through the forest . " Help ! Help me ! " Alex growled like an angry bear and dumped her on the ground . Fayth kept hold of his hair , pulling him down with her  --  ready to take a hank of it as a war trophy  --  until she realized he 'd released her . She scrambled to her feet . He was after her immediately , but this time she kept watch for trees and ran , not looking back . She could hear him pursuing her , could practically feel his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending power to her legs and she ran faster . It was her gift in lieu of strength , her father had always said . She was no match for a man , but she was faster than any could hope to be and had the stamina to leave them coughing in her dust . A grim pleasure came over her as she heard him fall behind . She resisted the nearly overwhelming urge to taunt him as she sometimes did her brothers . So intent was she on her escape , that she stumbled when her brother , Wesley , appeared from the trees . " Fayth ! " She veered away , stopping short to find herself confronted by her oldest brother , Lord Ridley Graham . She turned frantically as men-at-arms materialized from the trees to form a circle about her . Red Alex was nowhere in sight . Of course , he was n't stupid . They 'd string him up from a tree if they got their hands on him , no questions , no trial . He was one of the most hated and feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pale blue eyes icy with fury . He 'd removed his helm and sweat plastered the thinning golden brown hair to the sides of his head . " Just where are you off to , little sister ? " Fayth blinked innocently . " I had a female concern . " Her smile was strained . " It is now resolved . Come , we must be on our way . " She lifted her skirts , shaking off the dead leaves and dirt clinging to the fabric , and started back toward the track . Ridley caught her arm , turning her back to examine her . " Look at you ! " Fayth glanced down again , seeing the tear in her skirt and the missing gems . His gaze was on her hair and Fayth patted the plaits self-consciously . Her infernally wavy hair was escaping to bush about her face . " How can I present you to Lord Carlisle like this ? " " Perhaps his eyesight fails . He 's an old man after all . " " Goddamn it , Fayth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders in a resigned sigh , as if she really did n't care . But she did . Papa had never struck her . She 'd taken some blows on the training field , but that was different . Since Papa died six months past , Ridley had taken to slapping her or even flogging her with a strap when she displeased him . She 'd fought back at first . But he was her brother and knew all her tricks . And besides being larger and stronger , he never hit her with an audience  --  appearances were everything . So she 'd taken to clenching her teeth and enduring his abuse . It was over quicker that way . They passed Wesley , who stared at her with a bewildered expression . Poor Wesley , he simply could n't fathom why she refused to accept her fate . Why she could n't be the bootlicking lapdog he was . No , Fayth did n't even know Wesley anymore and that hurt worse than aught else . After giving orders to the men , Wesley joined them . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a wild animal . A boar , I think . " " A boar ? " Wesley 's expression brightened and he turned , hand on sword hilt . " It 's been years since I 've seen a boar . " " Not now , Wesley ! " Ridley barked . Resentment clouded Wesley 's face , but he complied , falling into step beside Fayth , who was being dragged along roughly . Wesley was only a year older than Fayth 's two and twenty years , though at times he seemed much younger . He should be his own man now , not Ridley 's reluctant servant . But Papa had left him nothing and Ridley promised rich rewards . Wesley elbowed her sharply . Fayth frowned at him . He shook his head meaningfully , his mouth a thin , hard line , the scar on his cheek standing out darkly . Fayth knew this was his way of begging her to behave , but she would have none of it . " What 's the matter , Wesley ? You want to chase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need Ridley 's permission ? " Ridley came to an abrupt halt and looked between the two of them . He was not ignorant of Fayth 's games and so he eyed her accusingly . He squeezed Fayth 's arm so hard she gritted her teeth to hold back a groan . Wesley stared incredulously at Ridley 's gloved hand . " Christ , Ridley , are you trying to break her arm ? Let her go ! " Ridley 's hand tightened so Fayth gasped , rising on her tiptoes to somehow contain the pain . Just as Wesley 's eyes narrowed and he stepped forward , Ridley released her . Fayth stumbled against Wesley , who caught her , cradling her abused arm in his hand . They both stared at Ridley 's retreating back . " Move ! " he shouted , not even turning . Wesley led Fayth forward , muttering under his breath . " Help me , Wesley . " Wesley shook his head , avoiding her gaze . He 'd left his helm with his horse and the mass of brown curls shone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake him until he was her Wesley again . " What would Jack think of you now ? " Wesley looked at her then , his face closed in anger . " Much has changed since Papa and Jack died . You 're the only one who does n't understand that . " " I do n't understand why it has to change , " Fayth persisted , praying she was getting through to him . " You promised me I would n't end up like Caroline  --  you promised ! " " You knew what was at risk when you botched the Maxwell raid . Ridley advised you of the consequences . There 's no one to blame but yourself . " Seeing her mutinous expression , he said in a softer tone , " I just do n't understand . What else is there for you ? You must wed . Why not Carlisle ? At least you 'll be rid of him soon . Why must you fight us ? " Fayth shook her head sadly . " You 're no different than Ridley . Do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor . You had honor once . " " Ridley makes things happen . " " Ridley speaks naught but falsehoods . How do you know all he promises you is truth ? " His hand that had been cradling her arm steadily tightened until he squeezed her as tightly as Ridley had . " I know , " he ground out through clenched teeth , as if trying to convince himself.Fayth tried to yank her arm away . " Let go ! You 're hurting me ! Wesley released her abruptly , his face paling as he looked from her arm to his own gloved hands . They reached the dirt where Ridley awaited them . He sent Wesley away with a look and shoved Fayth into the litter so she fell facefirst into the mound of pillows . She lay still , contemplating what she would do next . Should she tell them Red Alex was in the forest ? There was a time when Wesley had wanted to avenge Jack 's death as much as she did . He might still want to hunt Red Alex down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was unlikely they 'd find him . Half the men on the borders were after Red Alex 's hide and none had come close to snagging him . She toyed with the idea of setting Ridley on the outlaw as the cavalcade began its slow snaking journey through the forest . She sighed . Ridley probably would n't believe her anyway . He 'd accuse her of creating yet another diversion to aid her in more escape attempts . And he 'd be right . An unusual sense of hopelessness washed over her . Her whole life since Papa 's death seemed a series of near escapes . All she wanted was for life to return to normal  --  as it had been before Papa died . Fayth 's eyes drifted shut as fatigue filled her in heavy waves . A strange lethargy settled over her and her mind became blissfully blank . No thoughts of her brother , who forced her into this union ; no thoughts of Jack , the man she almost married , or his murderer , the black-hearted Red Alex ; no thoughts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt ... Caroline . No , even in sleep Fayth could not escape what she 'd done . The memories oozed through the thick haze of her mind . The fire again , the screaming . Fayth gasped , forcing her eyes open . Sweat stung them . Icy fingers trailed down her spine , even as her body swelled with an inexplicable restlessness . Bile soured her throat and she pushed a curtain back , securing it open . The cool breeze could n't sweep away the lingering feel of Jack 's murderer , holding her like a lover . And he 'd almost had her again , there in the wood . I 've been following ye since ye left Graham Keep . Why ? Why would he follow her ? Was he bent on revenge for what she 'd done ? The thought that he might possibly want revenge  --  after all he 'd done to ruin her life  --  made her seethe with contempt . The body of an enormous  --  and gaudily arrayed  --  stallion suddenly blocked her field of vision . Fayth 's gaze rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . His plumed helm rested on his knee . He glittered like a jewel . A green velvet surcoat covered his heavy mail sark . A thick gem encrusted chain spanned his chest , holding the ermine lined cloak in a graceful fall off his shoulders . He 'd not forgone his passion for indecently short breeches . The slashed green velvet barely covered the tops of his thighs and an obscenely large codpiece covered his groin . His horse was no less adorned , its mane and tail braided with ribbon . Feathers , tassels , and bells jingled and bobbed with every step . The assessing gaze that raked her found her wanting . He was still furious . " Can you not at least try to do something with that hair ? " " What 's the matter , Brother ? Are you afraid Scratchton Carlisle of Louseland wo n't take me if I 'm not perfectly arrayed ? Surely he 's used to scurvy-ridden women , being a Scot . " Ridley shook his head , sighing . " We 're not so different , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fayth scowled . " And is your betrothed an old hag ? " Ridley laughed . They both knew the earl of Dornock 's daughter was barely seventeen . " I care naught for her , just as you loathe the idea of Carlisle . Oh , it galls you to admit it , but it 's true . You lost your love and now you must make do with what 's left . Just as I lost mine  --  " " Mona was never yours ! She was Papa 's and he 'd beat you to a bloodied pulp if he knew how you pawed at her ! " He looked around , annoyed , to see if anyone overheard . " Enough . " Fayth smiled slightly . Nothing could get to him like the mention of Mona . Everyone loved Mona . She was kind , beautiful , wise . But Ridley loved their stepmother in a most unseemly and incestuous manner . His fury had been immense when she 'd helped his prisoner , Sir Patrick Maxwell , escape  --  and left with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . His face was a rigid mask . She might pay for her words later , but he would not strike her now , not in front of everyone . Never in front of Wesley , who watched them , frowning , several horses behind . Wesley . Once Fayth and Wesley had been inseparable . Fayth 's betrothed , Jack , had been Wesley 's closest friend . It had seemed the three of them were destined to be thick as thieves their whole lives . Ridley smoothed a hand over his beard , visibly trying to compose himself . " When we arrive at Lochnith , you will wed Carlisle . If you stay put and be a good little wife , I promise you , things will turn out well for you in the end . " Fayth knew much of what he planned from listening at closed doors . The Graham host accompanying Ridley was enormous , swollen to several hundred men-at-arms and retainers . It was necessary , as they traversed the lands of many sworn enemies . Although Ridley had obtained safe passage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned a bit of a foray after the wedding . Fayth 's betrothed was gifting Ridley with an estate at the southern end of the Rhins of Galloway  --  Gealach , it was called . Currently , however , Carlisle did not hold it . It had been taken by a band of outlaws several years ago and he had been unable to oust them . Ridley was determined to eradicate the outlaws , or destroy the tower trying . It was all very tiresome to Fayth , being the instrument of men 's doings and yet excluded from even discussing them . She sighed , weary of her brother and his plots . " I want no part in your evil deeds . " " Just like Mona , eh ? Well , do n't think for a minute that she 's free of me . You think she escaped ? " He laughed , an ugly , unpleasant sound . " I let her go . I know precisely where she is  --  she and her dunderhead knight . And when I 'm ready , I 'll have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shriveling up tight . How had he become so powerful ? His reach so far ? Mona must be warned . His words strengthened her resolve to escape . She must find Mona and warn her . Unfortunately she had no idea where her stepmother was , but a plan had been forming for weeks now . She would seek out Mona 's family . They lived in a little hamlet in the English West March . If Mona was n't with them , hiding from Ridley , then surely they would have some clue as to her whereabouts . Ridley believed she was the keeper of the legendary Clachan Fala . It was true Mona was a Musgrave and a healer , but Fayth thought it unlikely there was such a thing as the Blood Stone , so why would there be a keeper ? First , she had to escape . She slid a look at Ridley . He still stared at her with extreme displeasure . Fayth retreated inside the litter and drew the curtains , preferring no view at all to his face . Fayth had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was imprisoned again . She prowled her chambers , her desperation growing . Guards were stationed outside the door . Since Fayth had a proclivity for enlisting the help of servants , she 'd not been allowed any attendants . She was n't even allowed a lady 's maid until after the marriage had been consummated . At the thought of the approaching wedding night , Fayth recalled Mona 's warnings about Carlisle . He 's a cruel man , with evil desires . Your wifely duties will be unbearable  --  and will quite possibly kill you , if you do n't kill yourself first . Should you be forced to go through with this union I will prepare poisons for you that will kill him slowly , make it look as though he succumbed to an ailment . Fayth patted the pocket sewn into the underside of her kirtle . The poison Mona had given her . It was meant for Carlisle . Fayth did n't know if she could do it . If she could n't even kill Jack 's murderer , how could she hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silk of her skirts . The very idea made her ill . She knew her brothers had something dreadful planned for Carlisle , that this marriage and peace were a ruse . She was sickened she 'd been made a pawn in it . Just like Caroline . Only somehow , Caroline had found love and happiness , foiling Ridley in the end . Fayth stared at the door , gripping the vial so hard she was in danger of shattering it . What if Carlisle was n't cruel ? What if Mona was mistaken ? Fayth knew he had a son , several daughters , and an assortment of bastards . Back at home , before she 'd been barred from speaking to the servants , she 'd heard talk of Carlisle and his children  --  of beatings and incest . Of them running away , only to be caught and tied to poles like animals . There was even a rumor he 'd killed one of his bastard sons for fancying lads . Fayth surveyed the room . The gleaming walls were paneled and hung with Turkish carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a raised platform . Fayth shuddered and backed away . She went to the door and opened it . The guards were Grahams , not Carlisles . Damn . The Grahams were well versed in Fayth 's ways and immune to her wiles . " Get back inside , " one said . She ignored him and tried to walk between them , but they crossed their lances , barring her way . She ducked beneath the lances . One of them planted a huge hand on the top of her head . He turned her and shoved her back into the room . The door slammed shut behind her . " By God , you 're a knave ! " she shouted at the door . How dare he handle her so ! Her pride stung from the indignity . She scanned the room , her gaze falling on the narrow window deeply recessed in the wall . Fully aware of the multiple flights of stairs she 'd been forced up , she threw open the shutters and stared down at the people milling about below , worrying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaling the wall . Her shoulder ached with the memory of the last time she 'd attempted that feat , pulling her arm right from the socket . She rubbed her shoulder , grimacing . A sharp knock on the door startled her from her contemplation of the ground . She turned her back to the window , knowing whoever it was would not wait for permission . The door opened and Ridley entered , his insouciant gaze finding her . He was so pleased with himself these days . Fayth 's mouth curled into a sneer that only grew nastier when Wesley entered behind Ridley . Wesley 's gaze bounced off Fayth before wisely looking elsewhere . The angry redness was gone from the wound on his cheek , though it was ugly and twisted where Red Alex had cut him . He 'd not had it tended immediately , so it had festered . When finally lanced and drained it had grown far beyond the original cut . Though it finally healed , the process had left him disfigured . Fayth 's sarcastic greeting died in her throat when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furry dog . He was a formidable man , barrel-chested and stocky  --  solid as a stone wall . His thick iron gray hair waved over his shoulders . He was shorter than both her brothers , though twice as wide . She found herself unable to form a sentence , frozen by the hard gray eyes that inspected her body with possessiveness . She 'd been told he was three score , and though the youthful color had been leeched from his hair and eyebrows , they were as lustrous as a youth 's , shining like highly polished armor . His dark craggy face was lined , but from a hard cruel life , not from the ravages of age . And the lust in his eyes ... he looked perfectly capable of acting on it . " Oh , aye , " he said , his voice rough and abrasive , his Scots broad . " She 'll do . " Deep in her belly , Fayth knew at that moment that everything she 'd heard about Carlisle was truth , felt it so strongly she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing Fayth 's attention away from the soulless eyes . The dog was not a breed she was familiar with , so tall it came nearly to its master 's waist and lean with muscle . With its thick black and white fur , and long narrow snout , it looked part wolf . Its eyes were clear and healthy ; one a dark brown and the other a blue so pale it was almost white . Fayth realized vaguely that Ridley had been making introductions and that she 'd been correct in assuming this was her future husband , Lord Ashton Carlisle . " You fancy her ? " Carlisle asked . " The dog ? " Fayth asked hesitantly . " Aye . Do you like her ? " Fayth nodded . " She 's beautiful . What breed is she ? She looks somewhat like a wolf . " Carlisle contemplated the dog . She sat on her haunches and gazed up at him , whining softly . " I know not her breed , though I believe her too pudding-hearted to hiv wolf in her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that translated to " I stole her . " His smile was smooth , well oiled , exposing a rack of strong , white teeth . " I give her to ye . " He released the leather leash binding the dog to his side . As soon as the tension was relieved from the leash the dog left Carlisle and came to Fayth . Fayth held her hand out for the dog to sniff , then rubbed its ears . " What 's her name ? " " I was told she was the finest sleuth dog on the borders , but thus far she 's proven herself useless . So , that is what I call her  --  useless , worthless mongrel . If ye dinna want her , I 'll probably kill her  --  she eats too much . " Fayth held the dog 's head against her thigh . " Thank you , my lord . I like her very much . " They all stared at her with open suspicion ; even Wesley 's eyes narrowed in disbelief . They 'd been expecting defiance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise them , of that she was thankful . Carlisle crossed the room , coming to stand before her . The scent of ale and peat smoke drifted from him . He wore no beard , only a thick silvery mustache . " Ye promised me a wildcat , Graham . She 's meek as a mouse . " Fayth lowered her eyes submissively , though her hands kneaded the dog 's fur . So he did n't like meek ? It was too much to hope Carlisle would call off the betrothal and wedding because of her " meekness , " but Fayth would keep it up , just in case . Ridley did n't respond immediately , but his footsteps echoed across the wooden planks as he joined them . " ' T is an act , nothing more . " He took her face in his hand , forcing her to look at him . He smiled slightly . " She 'll not be able to keep it up long , mark me . " " Unhand her , " Carlisle said , frowning . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridley dropped his hand and stepped away . " Of course . " A spark of hope ignited in Fayth . Carlisle had given her a gift , however coarse he was about it  --  he was a Scot , after all , and could n't help his poor manners  --  and he appeared to be shielding her from Ridley . Perhaps he only treated his children poorly ? Could it be that he would be a good husband ? On impulse Fayth asked , " You have children here ? I 'm looking forward to meeting them . " Carlisle stared at her a long moment , unblinking . " Dinna get yer hopes up  --  a more worthless , ungrateful , selfish group of brats ye 'll niver meet . Even the bastards think o'er much of themselves . " Fayth 's heart sank . He was estranged from his children . Never a good thing . Carlisle grasped her chin as Ridley had . His fingers were harder , rougher as he turned her face this way and that . He yanked at the ties of her shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover herself , but the hard look he gave her made her lower her hands . Wesley tensed , mouth thinned , hand on his sword hilt . The scar on his cheek darkened above the fine whiskers of his golden brown beard . Ridley put a hand out , calming his younger brother . Fayth gritted her teeth , keeping her eyes averted , as if she deserved no better than this . The idea of killing him was becoming more palatable every second . " What is this ? " Carlisle asked , yanking the collar off her neck , baring her to the shoulder . He gripped her neck , pushing her head awkwardly to the side to reveal the weal marking her skin . She flushed with humiliation . " Oh , that , " Ridley said slowly . " A bit of discipline . " Carlisle turned Fayth so her back was to them , his hands pulling at her shift , shoving her stiff bodice downward . The welts , though healing , were scabbed and swollen , and the rough handling caused her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That this abuse should be exposed  --  that he should handle her like an animal that must be inspected before purchase . There was a long silence , then Carlisle asked , " Did she scream ? " " Not a sound . She glared at me and spat . Had she a dagger she would have cut my heart out . " The sound of rustling fabric . " She gouged my arm  --  see ? " " Indeed ? " Carlisle said in a voice thick with pleasure . Fayth 's breath caught . Her skin crawled from his touch . The door slammed . Wesley . Fayth knew he could n't bear to watch Carlisle handle her in such a fashion . So he left . There was a time when he would have thrashed a man who touched her with such familiarity . Everything had changed . " He 's suffering from the flux , " Ridley said in explanation . " Let 's hope he makes it to the privy . " Carlisle did n't respond . Fayth closed her eyes , her hand curled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God help me . She would throw herself from the window before she married this man . Carlisle turned her around . She kept her gaze on the floor , face hot with anger and desperation . His hands were on her face again , forcing her to look at him . He scrutinized her , as if trying to determine the truth . " I like you , little pretty . I think we 'll get on fine . " He released her and turned to leave . Ridley followed him to the door , but paused after Carlisle passed through . He craned his neck , as if watching the other man disappear along the corridor , then turned back to Fayth , his hand on the door latch . " You 're a lucky one , methinks . Blessed by fairies or some such . " " You 're the only one who believes in childish stories , Brother . " He ignored the bait . For years Papa and Ridley searched for the mysterious Clachan Fala  --  the Blood Stone  --  thought to be thousands of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa had married Mona , hoping to get the Blood Stone for himself . And now Ridley was carrying on the quest with a passion that far exceeded Papa 's . " He 's not quite right in the head , is he ? " Ridley said , still standing in the open doorway . " Mona had said he was sick of mind , but I did n't believe her . I thought it yet another ploy to save your skin . " " At least someone tried . " He made a moue of mock sympathy . " Poor Fayth , even Mona has abandoned you . Freed the big knight and followed her loins , eh ? " Fayth ignored him , wanting him to just go away . Seeing she was n't going to play his game today , he sighed and said , " Oh  --  about the poison hidden in your kirtle , I replaced it with berry juice some time ago , in case you decided to use it on me . " He laughed at her shocked expression . By the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , he was long gone . Fayth went to the bed . The dog climbed up beside her and lay its head in her lap . " What shall I do ? " she asked the dog , stroking her fingers through the silky fur . She could n't give up hope . There had to be a means of escape . No castle was impenetrable , from the inside or out  --  her father had taught her that . And once she was free , she 'd find Mona . Ridley would stop at nothing to get the Blood Stone . And that 's what he believed Mona to be doing  --  fetching the Blood Stone out of hiding to deliver to Caroline and her new husband , Robert Maxwell . If he was truly following Mona 's movements then she must be warned . And besides , Mona was all Fayth had left . Like Fayth 's sister Caroline , Mona had been mother and friend to her . Fayth had lost Caroline , but she would not give Mona up . She chewed at her thumbnail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could overcome this obstacle and find her stepmother .
