Chapter One Nikki stood at the grave of her ex-husband and thought , This is the last way I expected to get custody . Beside her was her fourteen-year-old daughter , April , quietly weeping . On Nikki 's other side , eleven-year-old Jared stared straight ahead , stoic . Nikki could sense her father , Buck , towering behind them . He would be scowling , she knew . Buck had hated Drake Cameron and probably considered his death just one more thing Drake had screwed up . Next to April stood Nikki 's mother , and Buck 's ex-wife , Opal , seriously soaking a hanky . Tucked into the crook of her arm was her fluffy white poodle , Precious , who was not . Opal had liked Drake very much ; she probably thought marrying him had been one of the few things Nikki had done right . Opal was one to appreciate money and pedigree , both of which she believed Drake had . Only forty-seven , Drake had appeared to be at the peak of health . Nikki could n't remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come home from school and found him facedown on the floor in his bathrobe , apparently dead since morning . The medical examiner 's preliminary finding was massive coronary . About fifty mourners gathered at the cemetery in the quickly rising heat of a late May morning in Phoenix . Most were lawyers and secretaries from the firm that had employed Drake , a tax law specialist . The only one of them Nikki knew was his secretary , Mona , who had been with him for at least ten years , long before the divorce . Nikki had to tangle with her every time she tried to make arrangements with Drake regarding the kids . A most unpleasant woman . A couple of teachers from April 's school had also come , as well as Jared 's principal and one of the soccer coaches . A small knot of teenagers - April 's friends - stood slightly off to one side , trying not to get too close to the adults . It was not a big crowd . Like Nikki , Drake was an only child . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant he did n't have a lot of friends . It was hard to cozy up to someone who insisted on control at any price . And then there was that business about grudges . Drake 's anger had great stamina ; he could stay mad forever . Somewhere in the gathering were Nikki 's two closest friends , Dixie McPherson and Carlisle Bartlett . Both were flight attendants at Aries Airlines , where Nikki was a pilot . They had worked together for the past ten years , starting when the company was still fairly new and small , and over the years there had been many times they 'd have been lost without one another . Like now . Although Dixie and Carlisle were both involved in serious relationships , Nikki had been on her own since the divorce . Oddly , as she looked down at the black earth that would cover her dead ex-husband , an arm around each of her children , she felt less alone now . The mourners filed past Nikki and the kids . " So sorry , " they murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , kids . Try to remember the good times you had with your dad . " April excused herself and went to join her friends , who immediately embraced her . Jared 's friends were probably considered too young by their parents to attend . Nikki shook hands and thanked each person , but Opal accepted condolences as though Drake were her son , inviting everyone back to Drake 's house for refreshments . Dixie and Carlisle waited till the last person had left , and April bid her friends goodbye and returned to Nikki 's side . " How 're you holding up ? " Dixie asked , while Carlisle simply filled his arms with April and Jared . " She 's doing very well , are n't you , Nicole ? " Opal replied for her . Precious snarled . " I 'm doing okay . Are you coming over to the house ? " Before Dixie could answer , April pulled herself free of Carlisle 's arms and , tears in her voice , asked , " Do we have to just keep doing this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine her pain . The kids had a hard time with their dad , but they had loved him . The hell of it was , she thought as she looked at Opal , you loved your parents even when you hated them . As for Jared , he just stared out at nothing , his detachment as troubling as April 's tears . " Oh , April , " Opal said . " People are going to be there , sweet . It 's the proper thing to do . Say a few kind words about the departed ... offer sympathy ... And your friends will be there . " " No , they wo n't , Grandma . I told them not to come . " " But we invited - " " So ? Do we have to ? " " It 's your house , April , " Nikki interjected . " I think Grandma 's just trying to do the right thing .... " " What a pain , " Jared muttered , giving the ground a kick . " We do n't want to seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , heading for his car . This whole reception thing her mother had planned was not for Opal , Nikki realized , and certainly not for herself . It was for April and Jared . And if they did n't want to do this ... " Um , guys , " she said to Dixie and Carlisle , " can you take my mother to the house ? We 're going to beg off . I 'll see you later . " " Thatta girl , " Carlisle cheered . " Nicole ! You ca n't do that ! " " Of course I can , Mother . We 'll be along later . Come on , kids . I have an idea . " With an arm around each , she walked them right past the funeral parlor 's limo to her car . ( Continues ... )
