<p> Perdue leads by example <p> As a 21-year Georgia state employee whose career has been dedicated toward addressing public health issues , I am impressed and proud of the example Gov . Sonny Perdue has displayed through his commitment to his own fitness plan ( " Perdue an off-the-wall racquetball opponent , " Metro , March 9 ) . <p> The answers to improving the wellness of Georgians and remedying the financial strains of health care are many and complex , but through his personal dedication and discipline , the governor is displaying outstanding leadership for all to follow . <p> WILLIAM P. KISSEL , Lilburn <p> Poor care for vets simply unpatriotic <p> It appalls me , reading how poorly our service personnel returning from active duty with horrendous injuries are being treated . It is one thing to talk about supporting our troops and another to see that in this very significant and fundamental way , our troops are supported with the very best possible medical and rehabilitative care . Unfortunately , Congress is not seeing that this is done . <p> I find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so taxes could be cut . Wartime is not the time to cut taxes needed to support our troops . A small segment of our citizenry is bearing the brunt for this military action while the rest of us are encouraged to act as if things are normal . The burden should be shouldered by all of us . This is a time when voicing what people want to hear is not as important as saying what needs to be said . That is called leadership . <p> Congress is not showing such leadership . Instead many of our senators and congressmen keep talking about cutting taxes because it sounds good and it gets them votes . Tax cuts to wealthy Americans should not be continued . To fight the war on terrorism properly , we must have financial resources . <p> Tell your senators and representatives that you expect responsible leadership from them , not self-serving , pablum-filled rhetoric . <p> SUSAN JOSEPH , Sandy Springs <p> Halliburton 's all about taking <p> Halliburton is moving to Dubai ( Halliburton moves HQ to Dubai , " News , March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do anything to avoid paying their share of taxes . There are no taxes in Dubai . <p> Here is a company that contributes nothing to the United States . All it does is take . There is no giving back . It uses other companies to get the work done and takes a share of the profits off the top . It is very inefficient at doing this . All you have to do is look at what Halliburton has done in Iraq and here in the United States  --  at the Hurricane Katrina ravaged Gulf Coast . <p> MICHAEL DE GIVE , Atlanta <p> Newt Gingrich due better treatment <p> The " Noted " column on the front page of the @issue section of March 11 said , " ' There are times that I have fallen short of my own standards . ' So said Newt Gingrich , acknowledging that he was having an extramarital affair even as he led the effort to impeach Bill Clinton for , well , doing much the same thing that Gingrich was doing . " <p> Perhaps , like the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth when misleading better suits our purpose . <p> The effort to impeach Clinton was for perjury . Remember Clinton saying , " That all depends on what the meaning of the word ' is ' is ? " That was under oath , as were other misleading statements . Of course , " I did not have sexual relations with that woman , Ms. Lewinsky , " was only under God , and only directly to the American people . <p> Clinton deserved to be impeached for perjury . Georgia 's native son , Newt Gingrich , deserves better treatment from Georgia 's " noted " newspaper . <p> BILL IVEY , Tucker <p> Arbor Place , do n't make every teen suffer <p> I am very concerned about Arbor Place mall 's new rule ( " Arbor Place mall tells teens : Do n't come without your parents , ' Page One , March 10 ) . <p> In my opinion , it makes teenagers feel unwelcome . The rule states that no teen under the age of 18 will be allowed to " hang out " at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For teenagers the mall is the only place you can " hang out . " Arbor Place mall is enforcing this rule due to " immature and disruptive " teens . If the teenagers are acting up , do something about it . Escort them out yourself . Call their parents . <p> It is n't fair to penalize every teenager for the wrongdoings and actions of a few . You should n't stereotype every teenager as " immature and irresponsible . " <p> MEGAN COLE <p> Cole , of Temple , is 14 years old and a regular shopper at Arbor Place mall where , she says , she spends an average of $50 per trip . <p> Why choose sides ? Just do what 's right <p> Given the constant news relating to conflict between sides , it is little wonder that so many people today think more about themselves than about others . It is also little wonder that so many people are apprehensive about the future . <p> Consider the following conflicts : women vs. men , liberal vs. conservative , black vs. white , rich vs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokers vs. nonsmokers , urban vs. rural , Jew vs . Muslim , atheist vs. all deity-based religions , etc . And this list does not include sports rivalries , many of which are passionate . <p> Rather than choosing sides , if each person simply does what is right every day , the world will be a better place , fewer conflicts will occur , stress-related illness will decline , and news outlets will have less negative news to report . <p> MIKE DEAL , Alpharetta <p> On-time arrivals high for commuter rail <p> It 's unfortunate that columnist Jim Wooten does n't know the difference between a transcontinental Amtrak passenger train and local commuter rail ( " Thinking right , " @issue , March 9 ) . <p> It 's very true , as Wooten notes , that long-distance Amtrak trains frequently arrive late after cross-country trips of hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of miles . <p> Commuter trains make much shorter trips and are much less likely to suffer delays . On-time arrival percentages for most U.S. commuter-rail operations are in the 95 percent range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEAGLE / StaffAs the commuter rail debate heats up , the fact remains that freight carriers own many of the tracks , a reality that could create congestion and delays . Amtrak also uses some of the tracks .
