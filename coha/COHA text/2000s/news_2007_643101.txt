<p> Debbie Bancroft 's daughter Serena , a towheaded 11-year old with a tennis tan , had an important announcement one recent Sunday afternoon . " Mom , you know the Southside , that drink they have at National ? " she asked . " Daddy put it in the chicken last night . Like , all of it . " <p> Mrs. Bancroft , an Upper East Side hostess who bears a strong resemblance to the actress Kathleen Turner in her prime , made a face that conveyed more annoyance than incredulity . <p> " You mean , to marinate it ? " she wondered . " He did not . " <p> The two were high-stepping their way in flip-flops through the gravel driveway of the family 's trim house here , en route to their car . They were headed to town to buy provisions . <p> In five hours , 12 guests were scheduled to show up for a barbecue  --  12 whose ranks included several names of the boldface variety : Vera Wang , the bridal-gown designer ; Patricia Duff , the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd singer and bass player ; Robert Wilson , the experimental theater director ; and Sarah Jones , who wrote and starred in the Tony Award-winning play " Bridge and Tunnel . " <p> And in the " possibly " category : Kelsey Grammer ( known for his role as television 's Frasier , he of the tossed salads and scrambled eggs ) and his wife , Camille . " Kelsey has n't told me yes or no for sure yet , " Mrs. Bancroft said with a sigh . " I called him again yesterday to check , and some man answered , and I waited on hold for five minutes . I could try him again , but at a certain point , dignity kind of kicks in . " <p> As for the Southside employed at the National Golf Links in Southampton  --  a semisecret concoction of sugar , mint and lime , typically mixed in a sterling shaker with vodka or rum  --  well , it did not strike Mrs. Bancroft as an appropriate marinade , but she knew it was not up to her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said of her husband , a banker , who is listed in " The Blue Book of the Hamptons " as William Woodward Bancroft Jr . <p> Mr. Bancroft 's willingness to cook at a few dinner parties every summer , even if this consists mainly of monitoring the grill , is a pivot point of their 18-year marriage . <p> For while Mrs. Bancroft , 52 , is about as steady a fixture as one finds on the society circuit  --  involved in charities galore , and a good deal of fashion promotion  --  Mr. Bancroft , also 52 , shows up in the party pages as often as J. Press alters the hemline on its Bermuda shorts , which is to say almost never . <p> " Small dinners like these are about the only times I can get Billy to socialize with other people , " Mrs. Bancroft said . " The party has to come to him . " <p> The Bancrofts of Southampton ( no relation to the Bancrofts of Dow Jones ) may inhabit rarefied territory , but shopping for a cookout on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more quintessentially American experience than the opportunity to gather outside , throw meat ( and maybe a representative from the vegetable family ) on the grill , and eat under the sky as dusk falls ? <p> Mrs. Bancroft and Serena drove first to La Parmigiana to buy fresh mozzarella , then to Tate 's Bake Shop for a chocolate mousse cake . Serena suggested that they get another cake to make sure they did not run out . " Two cakes is obscene , " Mrs. Bancroft said . <p> " We 're at 16 , " Serena said . " If Kelsey comes . " <p> A Marie Antoinette cake  --  a six-layer extravaganza of yellow and chocolate cakes , raspberry jam , raspberry butter cream and chocolate mousse  --  was bought as well . <p> The Bancrofts have been summering in the Hamptons since more or less forever . " Billy 's family had a place here , and I grew up on Long Island , " Mrs. Bancroft said . " Billy 's not really big on change . He grew up on East 72nd Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thing . " <p> Serena and her 16-year-old brother , Will , learned to swim and play tennis at the clubs of Mr. Bancroft 's childhood , the Southampton Bathing Corporation  --  " the Beach Club "  --  and the Meadow Club . <p> The Bancrofts camped in Billy 's godmother 's pool house for some years , then rented , and finally bought their shingled Colonial here three years ago . It 's north of the highway  --  so it goes  --  and , as it 's of new construction , came covered with siding , which they promptly tore off and replaced with wood . It has a big yard and a swimming pool , and a wet bar off the living room . Will christened it " Da Crib . " <p> " And Holly Peterson put it on stationery for us , " Mrs. Bancroft said , referring to the television news producer and author . <p> " You know , like how Pop-Pop has Ocean Grove or whatever ? " Serena said . " And we have Da Crib . " Pop-Pop is A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His stepdaughter , Tiffany Dubin , a style author , is a friend of the Bancrofts . <p> Driving up their block on the way home , Serena counted the cars outside a house the Bancrofts are convinced is being used by a horde of young people as a summer share , violating a local ban on group houses . <p> " Mommy , I see 10 , " she said . <p> " I 'm going to Hampton Bays tomorrow " to take the issue to local officials , Mrs. Bancroft said . <p> Back in the kitchen , she and her daughter set about decorating the cakes . Serena poured half a box of dragees over the tops . Then , after much deliberation , she pressed a big pair of wax lips right in the middle of each . <p> " That 's kind of fantastic , " Mrs. Bancroft declared . <p> Soon Mr. Bancroft appeared in the kitchen in shorts , a pink and green golf shirt and bare feet . He had been playing golf all day in the annual four-ball tournament at National , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconsolately . <p> " We might come in second , " he said . <p> " Well , that 's good , " Mrs. Bancroft said . " Do you get a silver cup for that ? " <p> " No , you get one of these , " Mr. Bancroft said , shaking hands with an imaginary person . <p> Then Mrs. Bancroft and Serena turned their attention to place cards . " We try to come up with a theme every year , and this year I 'm writing them as prescription labels on little pill bottles , " Mrs. Bancroft said . " So , like , for Roger Waters , I 'm writing , ' For the treatment of vertigo , ' because , you know , ' The Wall ? ' " <p> And for the photogenic Ms. Duff , who has been known as something of a man-killer , Mrs. Bancroft dictated to her daughter : " Write ... ' Patricia . Hydrochloric acid . ' " <p> " I do n't get it , " Serena said . <p> " It 's a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , because she 's the kind of woman that you just have to hate her sometimes , she 's so perfect . You really do n't want her seated next to your husband . " <p> Suddenly , Mrs. Bancroft looked up . " Daddy has n't started cooking yet , and I 'm getting nervous , " she said . <p> " I think he 's upstairs watching golf on TV , " Serena said , then went to fetch him . <p> When they returned , Mr. Bancroft got down to business . Out came platters , tongs , bug spray , frozen tacos , arugula mix and plenty of meat : tenderloin , sausages and that Southside-soaked chicken . <p> He even offered to help his wife with the place cards . For one of his golfing buddies , he suggested she prescribe something for the yips , a tendency to seize up when putting . For Steve Colman , a performer and poet , he said , " How about something for ' rhymatism ? ' " <p> " Oh , my God , Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I used to be an ad man , " Mr. Bancroft reminded her . <p> Things were coming together . Mrs. Bancroft went outside , cut a few hydrangeas from a plant , and stuck them in a vase . Ms. Duff , who was staying with the Bancrofts for the weekend , came outside to help with seating arrangements . ( Putting Mr. Wilson near Mr. Waters turned out to yield an introduction , and the remark from Mr. Waters : " I think we met years ago , actually . I believe you were very drunk . " ) <p> Mrs. Bancroft made a quick trip to the Meadow Club to pick up Will , and appointed him to program the evening 's soundtrack on his iPod . <p> Serena threw up her hands in pretend distress : " Mommy , I hope your friends like hip-hop . " <p> Mrs. Bancroft went upstairs to change and insisted that her husband put on long pants . Soon , the gravel crunched outside with the arrival of the evening 's first guests. ##
