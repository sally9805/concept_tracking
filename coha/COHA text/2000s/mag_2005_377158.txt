Our betters religious and ? ? secular ? ? like instruct us on the virtues of universal brotherhood . But it is hard enough to overcome selfishness ; harder still to overcome ties of family and tribe and nation . How are we to feel for all humanity ? <P> Our efforts to institutionalize universalism have been disappointing . The U.N. , intended to be the parliament of man , has instead become a cockpit of rivalries that often sharpen , not lessen , feelings of national and racial hostility . Our other famous attempt , the Olympics , has also fallen short . The opening and closing ceremonies can be sweet celebrations of our oneness . But sandwiched in between are two weeks of doping , cheating , clawing and jousting to earn you a flag-draped victory lap and gold to bring home to the tribe . <P> These noble failures suggest that self-conscious attempts at creating community simply do n't work . Our divisions are too profound . True expressions of our common humanity are more spontaneous , if infrequent . And they generally emerge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It is a particular kind of disaster , however , that moves us to recognize global solidarity . Epidemics are simply too slow . And localized catastrophes , such as the mudslides and floods in the U.S. last week or even the Iranian earthquake of 2003 , are usually too parochial in their victimization to catch the attention of all humanity . It takes a multicontinental cataclysm  --  instantaneous , catastrophic , widely spread  --  to shake the world from its self-absorption . The tsunami that destroyed thousands of lives from Sumatra to Somalia engendered an instant , near-universal outpouring of concern , shared grief and charitable giving . Ronald Reagan once startled the U.N . by suggesting in a speech that humanity would unite and forget its petty divisions if we were attacked from outer space . This elicited widespread head scratching , but the point was unassailable : external threats do exactly that  --  not little green men but forces closer to home , forces we often assume we have tamed . <P> Comes the tsunami and we realize to our horror that Nature has merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hundreds of thousands of us are broken , entire nations thrown into chaos and grief . It is the ultimate reminder of our common fragility , of just how precarious our species ' ridiculously brief sojourn on this earth really is . <P> The other , more ennobling reminder of our common humanity is scientific discovery , which reveals not our vulnerability but our genius , not our weakness but our glory . The most universal of these inspirations have come , literally , from outer space , from our few distant glimpses of the uniqueness of our tiny earthly habitat and the brilliance of the species that could contrive to get up , out and beyond it . Indeed , the birth of our modern " whole earth " consciousness can be traced to a single act of exploration : Apollo 8 's circumnavigation of the moon and the astonishing photo  --  Earthrise , that vision of a little blue planet  --  that it sent back .
