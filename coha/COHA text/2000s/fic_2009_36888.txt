Olivia Cline drew a handful of paintbrushes from a mason jar on the closet shelf and wrapped them in careful folds of newspaper before laying them in a waiting shoe box . <p> A hank of dishwater-blond hair fell into her eyes and she swept it to the side , tucking it behind one ear before loading a second shoe box with crimped tubes of oil paint . <p> " Hey , you . " Derek poked his head through the doorway of the spare room , a cardboard box hefted on one shoulder . He cocked his head . " What are you doing ? " <p> " Just packing up my art stuff . Do n't let the movers take it , though . I 'll bring it in the car when I come down . " <p> Sighing , Derek rolled his eyes . He lowered the box to the floor and came to put his hands on her shoulders . " Olivia . " <p> Her husband 's voice was stern , but she 'd trained herself to discern the twinkle in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green flecks of his hazel eyes . He was n't angry with her . She relaxed a bit . <p> The lines on Derek 's brow smoothed and a crooked smile bloomed on his face . " For the first time in our lives we have the luxury of leaving the packing to professionals . " He slid his hands down her arms , took the shoe box from her and set it back on a shelf in the closet . " Let the movers take care of it . You never use that stuff anyway . Why do n't you get rid of it ? One less thing to haul . " <p> She tried to ignore the lump of resentment inching up her throat . Derek had come a long way in the last year , but there were momentsShe swallowed hard . " Not yet . And I 'd feel better if I at least pack the boxes . Did you see what they did with Grandma 's dishes ? " <p> " These guys know what they 're doing . You can trust them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Aware that she was biting her tongue , Olivia shook away the storm of thoughts clouding her mind and looked past Derek , over the railing to the living room below . She might be learning to trust her husband again , but she definitely did n't trust the crew of clumsy galoots down there lobbing boxes like so many circus jugglers . Oil paints were expensive . And her sable brushes could be too easily crushed  --  if they were n't already in danger of rotting from age and lack of use . <p> Behind her , Derek cleared his throat . " I just thought this might be a good chance to get rid of that stuff . The new house is n't that much bigger than this place . Besides , you have n't done any painting inwhat ? Three years ? Four ? " <p> Six , to be exact . And that hurt . Derek never had understood how much she 'd given up when she put her brushes away to take a " real " job . As he often reminded her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic talents in her work . She owed her success as an interior decorator to her gifts as an artist , and in her eyes , the two years of art school under her belt were far more valuable than her bachelor 's degree in business administration . They 'd certainly been more fun to earn . <p> Oh , she liked her job . It would be hard to say goodbye to her clients and colleagues next week . But she secretly hoped she might get back to her art once they were settled in Missouri . Not that a little burg like Hanover Falls was any artists ' mecca , but at least maybe she 'd have more time for her art . <p> Derek was on a different track , though . He wanted a baby . Babies . She wanted a family , too . But now ? So soon afterafter all they 'd been through ? She was n't sure . Maybe they needed a couple of years to adjust to the new town , practice everything they 'd learned in a year of marriage counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had plenty of time . Some of their friends had n't started their families until they were almost forty . <p> But Derek had wanted children  --  at least four of them  --  for years . It was one of the things they fought about most , from the very beginning , when they were both still in school racking up astronomical student loans and living on macaroni and cheese in a shabby one-bedroom apartment . And not " shabby chic , " either . Just plain shabby . <p> But now Derek had landed this great job , and everything they 'd hoped for was falling into place . He would start work in Hanover Falls in a few days . So why did she literally tremble every time she thought about leaving Chicago and settling down to become the mother of Derek Cline 's children ? <p> Something clanged downstairs and Derek flinched . " I 'd better go see what that was . " <p> " Please do , " she said . She followed him out of the room and looked over the railing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spotted the painting still hanging on the wall in the foyer . With a little gasp , she brushed past Derek and raced down the stairs . This painting was one thing she was not willing to risk to this moving crewmake that wrecking crew , she thought as another crash split the air . <p> She hurried to the foyer and lifted the canvas from its perch on the narrow wall . The oak frame was nothing special and the canvas had buckled slightly . She promised herself she 'd take the time to repair the painting before she hung it in the new house . Something about this piece had always anchored her , had always said " home " like nothing else she owned . <p> She inspected the landscape that had taken her a full month to complete . A wry smile tilted her mouth . One of Derek 's pet peeves about her was that she was not easily impressed . But with this particular work of her own hands , she 'd finally managed to impress herself . <p> All these years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green afternoon shadows in the peaceful pastoral scene . Alongside her asymmetrical trees , three cows contemplated their reflections in a glassy pond . It was odd , when she thought about it , that this painting captivated her so . She was a city girl . Always had been . Usually , neon and stainless steel made her heart beat faster . But something in this bucolic scene spoke to her , touched a tender place inside her . A place she treasured without quite knowing why . <p> Though he 'd never come right out and said so , she suspected Derek did n't even care for the piece . She still remembered his too-casual comment the day they 'd first moved in to this apartment , when he 'd noticed it leaning against the wall waiting to be hung in the foyer . " Are you sure that 's where you want it ? " he 'd asked . " This will be the only part of the place some people see . " <p> She had n't challenged him then to come out and say what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why was the painting still here now ? Her gaze panned the bare walls of the large combination living room and dining room . Derek had orchestrated the packing of all their other paintings and artwork  --  all works of other artisans  --  first thing this morning . Why was this one still here ? Did Derek think this move provided a convenient opportunity to leave her painting behind ? <p> She stared at the artful splotches of sienna and white paint that resembled grazing cows . Her fingers caressed the rough strokes of paint . The piece had an impressionistic quality about it . To Olivia 's embarrassment her friend Jayne had compared it to a Monet . But she 'd been flattered , too . <p> " I do n't care what he thinks , " she whispered . But the defiance in her voice startled her . Obviously , she did care . <p> In the kitchen , Olivia found the roll of heavy brown paper the movers had been using to wrap items . She ripped off a long sheet and let it trail behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulky frame and placed it on the folds of paper , swaddling it tenderly , as though it were a newborn . She taped the wrapping securely in place , then carried the unwieldy bundle out to her car . She propped it carefully on the floor of the backseat . When she packed the car to join Derek in Hanover Falls next week , she would use the last of the towels and bedding from the house as further padding for the fragile painting . <p> And she would hang it in a spot of honor in the house there . Maybe it would somehow make that house feel a little more like home for her . <p> A siren wailed on the streets beyond the cul-de-sac where the Clines ' Chicago town house sat . Olivia filled a disposable coffee cup with water from the kitchen faucet and walked across the shiny oak floor to put it in the microwave . The heels of her pumps clattered on the wood , echoing throughout the small apartment . She would stop by Starbucks on her way to work for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did help ward off the early-March chill of the empty rooms . She 'd turned the furnace up five degrees , but still it felt as if the icy wind was blowing off Lake Michigan and straight through some invisible seam in the walls of this place . <p> She punched in another thirty seconds on the microwave and headed for the front door to retrieve the morning paper . Halfway down the hall , she remembered that Derek had cancelled their subscription as of yesterday . Deep scars in the carpet where their barrister bookcases had sat reminded her that her books , too , were already in Hanover Falls . She felt disoriented and lost in her own home . Everywhere she reached , she ended up grasping empty air . Nothing was where she expected it to be . She 'd lived this way for almost a week now , and it was starting to make her crazy . <p> The microwave turntable groaned to a stop and the timer dinged . She turned over her wrist and glanced at her watch . Seven forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker &amp; Associates this very minute . She pictured him " administrating "  --  or whatever it was Engineering Administrators did  --  in suit and tie . <p> A smile cut through her melancholy . Her husband would be in hog heaven about now . He 'd always been in his element bossing people around . And he was good at it . He knew how to manage people in such a way they didn ' t realize they were being managed . It was his gift . He 'd employed it with her in their decade of marriage more than she cared to admit . But that was all in the past now . The counseling had been good for them . <p> She took the steaming cup from the microwave and measured in a heaping spoonful of instant coffee . As she stirred , the aroma wafted upward to her nostrils , doing a fair impersonation of real coffee . <p> She sighed . As difficult as it had been , she and Derek had both grown through the painful , tearful sessions with Tom and JoAnne Bennett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselors . The Bennetts had weathered some storms of their own and their advice was offered with the authority only experience could bring . Olivia could finally say with conviction , " I 'm glad we stuck it out . It was worth every agonizing minute . " <p> She still was n't sure about the babies part . Oh , sure , she wanted kids . Eventually . When she dared picture herself as a dotty old woman , she definitely envisioned herself a grandmother . But Olivia had been an only child , a much-longed-for baby born when her mother was forty-two and her father almost fifty . She had n't been around children much , and frankly they scared the daylights out of her . <p> She and Derek had married when they were both barely twenty , and the ten years since had been eaten up with earning their degrees and launching careers . Now that Derek had his second master 's degree and a job commensurate with it , they finally had some financial relief and time to enjoy each other . <p> They almost had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip of coffee and grimaced . A wave of nausea swept over her as she thought of the betrayal and anguish of the last two years . Derek 's affair . She still almost could n't make those words be true in her mind . It made her physically ill to consider the thought , the words choking her . She 'd never dreamed something like that could happen to her . To them . <p> No one had been more in love than she and Derek Cline on their perfect wedding day . Sometimes she looked at their wedding album , studying their fresh young faces for a hint of what was to come . <p> She never found it . In the photos , their faces were luminous , their eyes only for each other . She felt she was looking at pictures of strangers . She still loved Derek , maybe more than ever . But she could n't remember that innocent , giddy love they 'd surely felt on that day . That once-upon-a-time fairy-tale day . <p> If there was a hint of the angst to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles worn by Derek 's parents in their wedding portraits . Her own parents had died within a few months of each other while she was in her last year of college , and she had thought she would know the love of parents and family again in Bill and Carolyn Cline . <p> Unfortunately , Olivia Masden was n't what the Clines had in mind for their only son . Derek 's mother had been cold and distant from the first time they met . Olivia learned much later that Carolyn was still angry with her son for breaking up with his high school sweetheart and then daring to get married before he had a college degree . <p> Derek 's father had actually accused Olivia  --  thankfully not to her face  --  of being a gold digger . The Clines had worn plastic smiles and behaved with civility the day of the wedding , but once the ink was dry on the marriage license , they 'd made no bones about the fact they were less than happy with Derek 's choice . <p> Olivia and her mother-in-law maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , Olivia had made a valiant effort to bridge the distance . But she 'd finally given up and learned to be grateful for the occasional tidbits of friendship Carolyn tossed her way . <p> Then five years ago , Carolyn had been diagnosed with breast cancer . Against Derek 's protests , Olivia had reached out to her , even spending days at a time with her in the Clines ' stately Oak Park home while Derek was on the road . By the time her mother-in-law died , barely a year after she was diagnosed , Olivia almost felt as if she 'd lost a friend . <p> Bill Cline remarried less than a year later and retired to Florida to play golf every day . His new wife was even less interested in having a relationship with Olivia  --  or Derek , for that matter . Olivia sent birthday cards to both Bill and Doris , and Father 's Day cards that she signed Derek 's name to , but they had n't spoken since the Christmas before last . <br> Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
