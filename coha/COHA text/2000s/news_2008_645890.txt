Months before he was slain in San Francisco , Supervisor Harvey Milk passionately argued that unless gays and lesbians left the closet , they never would change the attitudes of the straight majority . <p> " Invisible , we remain in limbo - a myth , a person with no parents , no brothers , no sisters , no friends who are straight , no important positions in employment , " Milk proclaimed in his famous " Hope " speech in 1978 . <p> Now , 30 years after the gay leader 's assassination , a national audience will be introduced to his message through Gus Van Sant 's star-studded biopic " Milk , " which opens in the Bay Area tonight . In the wake of national protests and boycotts over California voters passage of Proposition 8 - which bans same-sex marriage - a question arises : Can the dramatized Milk make the same kind of political impact as his real-life counterpart ? <p> At the very least , many activists and media experts say , " Milk " has the potential to engage the politically inert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's more than a biopic of a gay politician - it 's the biopic of a movement coming of age , " said Neil Giuliano , president of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , who used to be the closeted mayor of Tempe , Ariz . " The vast majority of Americans under , say , 35 barely know this story . ... I think , especially for young people , they will learn social justice is worth fighting for , even if they do n't always win . " <p> " What changes any one of our lives ? " asked National Gay and Lesbian Task Force director Rea Carey . " It can be a media image . I certainly hope ' Milk does that . " <p> Former Milk aide and " Milk " consultant Cleve Jones , who recently penned an opinion piece for The Chronicle with " Milk " screenwriter Dustin Lance Black , said : " ' Milk is just the sort of film gay people could take friends and family to see . ... It has real power to inform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of film 's efficacy as an instrument of political change . <p> " I do n't think movies are made , generally , to change political or social behavior , " said award-winning film historian David Thomson . " Gradually , sometimes movies do have an effect ... but my instinct is to be very cautious . <p> " You can point to certain films that , in a very Hollywood-y way - ' The Defiant Ones , ' In the Heat of the Night - take very deliberate , strong attitudes toward racism , but I do n't know whether they had very much effect except preaching to the converted . " <p> Given the uproar over Prop . 8 , the film 's timing is dramatic . <p> Some of the movie 's most memorable moments come as Milk and his advisers work to defeat 1978 's Proposition 6 - a measure promoted by former Florida beauty queen Anita Bryant that would have barred gays and lesbians from teaching in schools . <p> The parallels between the film 's depiction of Prop . 6 and this year 's vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first " Milk " screenings in late October , debate erupted across film blogs about why " Milk " did n't get to general audiences before election day . Some , including Jones , thought it could have made some difference in the outcome of Prop . 8 . <p> " The end decision was not to have the film speaking directly to the election , because if it was seen to be just about the election , that might take away its chance of having a life after the election , " director Van Sant said in an interview with Filmmaker magazine . <p> At the film 's premiere last month in San Francisco , crowds toting anti-Prop. 8 signs lined Castro Street , eager to capitalize on the film 's political message . Now , some are organizing a boycott against Cinemark Theatres , a Texas chain that is showing " Milk " on its screens but whose CEO , Alan Stock , donated $9,999 to the " Yes on 8 " campaign . <p> A YouTube employee , San Franciscan Justin Green , co-created a Facebook group and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fellow Facebook member Mark Rooney were aiming for 1,000 people to commit to avoiding Cinemark 's " Milk " showings . The group has more than 17,000 members . <p> " I thought that the irony that Stock would be indirectly profiting from ' Milk was terrible , " said Green , 28 . He also notes that he 's a political neophyte . " I have never done anything like this before - I was n't even on student council . I had no idea the film would affect me emotionally like this . " <p> Cinemark issued a statement last week denying any companywide stance on Prop . 8 : " Any individual act or contribution is just that , individual acts of personal expression , and do not reflect company positions or policy . " <p> Although it remains unclear what role " Milk " will play in the Prop . 8 issue , experts are quick to point out that in general , positive representations of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender figures , both real and fictional , in television and film help increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that pop culture and media has played a much larger role in advancing gay rights than people give it credit for , " said San Francisco pollster David Binder . " The first mainstream gay roles in the ' 70s were enormously effective at making the general public look at gays and lesbians . ... Before that , when gays were invisible , there was this fear that gays were sordid or overly sexual , a threat to children - all these terrible stereotypes . It was initially through TV and the big screen that those stereotypes were combatted . " <p> Binder said mainstream media representation could be more influential in public opinion of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community than other marginalized minorities because of its ability to be hidden . " Communication methods may go further , " he said . " There 's a greater sense of invisibility for gays than groups that can be identified , say , by the color of skin . " <p> University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee Professor Paul Brewer , author of " Value War : Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent research on the " Virtual Contact Hypothesis " - a theory from the University of Minnesota that holds that " knowing " even fictional gay people from TV or movies reduces hostility of homosexuality as a whole - as evidence that TV and movies can sway opinion . But he says the most powerful effect is in the aggregate collection of pop culture portrayals . <p> " If I had a hunch , I would n't focus too much on any one movie or TV show . One can certainly start debate - like ' Philadelphia or ' Ellen - but what we know about media effects is that exposure to any one medium tends to fade over time . It 's the steady exposure to positive images of gays and lesbians that changes public opinion . " <p> In the end , " Milk " director Van Sant and Focus Features , rather than using the film as a political weapon , chose to release the film in the holiday season to ensure the largest possible audiences and optimal Oscar-grabbing attention . Their movie was a vehicle for storytelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story gets shown in multiplexes around the country , " Milk " might well make good on the famous opening line of the politico 's " Hope " speech - " I 'm Harvey Milk , and I 'm here to recruit you .
