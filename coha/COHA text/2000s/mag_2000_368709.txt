Mohammed Helo sits in the murky shadows inside his pharmacy . He turned the lights off to save electricity when violence engulfed the West Bank in the past month and his customers stopped coming . It is an emblematic darkness . Helo 's village , Bidya , had been a bright symbol of the links that peace had forged between Israelis and Palestinians . Israelis came to Bidya , only a few miles from Tel Aviv 's suburbs , to spend $50 million a year on furniture , clothes and auto parts . Then came the new intifadeh . Four weeks ago , an Israeli was murdered there as he waited for his tires to be changed . And Mohammed Helo flicked the switch . <P> Now Bidya is once more a microcosm of what is being planned by the politicians . Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak 's advisers are sketching out " unilateral separation , " which they will impose on the Palestinians if Yasser Arafat declares statehood , something that could happen as soon as this month . That means choking off the Palestinian economy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Helo . " It is a war of hunger , and it is very dangerous . " <P> Israel is looking for alternatives to the peace process . Separation is the only option it has found . It would break many of the close economic , political and legal links that have grown out of years of occupation , from the Israeli cell phones that Palestinians carry at their hips to the Palestinian sweet potatoes on Israeli dinner tables . Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami says the separation plan will kick in only if Arafat declares his state unilaterally , as he threatens to do after Nov. 15 . That state was supposed to be negotiated with Israel , so , Ben-Ami says , Israel will view a declaration as the end of the peace process . President Bill Clinton , scrambling to keep peace alive , has invited Arafat and Barak to the White House once the violence subsides to talk about resuming those negotiations . But there 's a strong urge among Israelis to turn their backs on the Palestinians , whose leader rejected at Camp David this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95% of the land in the West Bank . " Arafat is leading the Palestinians toward the declaration of a hostile state born in conflict , not from the peace process , " Ben-Ami tells TIME . " Separation is the inevitable response . " <P> Many Israelis have long hankered for separation . Yitzhak Rabin once told Arafat he wanted separation " not out of hatred , but out of respect . " Palestinians , he believed , needed to find a way to stand on their own . Barak 's election campaign last year ran a poster with the slogan US HERE , THEM THERE . But it was supposed to be the result of peace talks . U.S. diplomats fear that separation  --  even if it comes in response to a unilateral move by Arafat  --  will lead only to more violence as Palestinians feel the shock of isolation . " For the peace process , unilateral separation is truly disastrous , " says a U.S. diplomat . " What flows from it is inevitable conflict . " The appeal of separation for Israelis is that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Bank , avoiding the friction points on the edges of Palestinian towns where their troops now face off against rioters . They would also give up enough land to put the onus on Arafat to make his new state work , instead of blaming Israel for its problems .
