PREFACE // She always knew he would come back to her . // He would climb into his helicopter at first light one Nairobi morning // and rise above the screaming madhouse of the city , tilting west over // East Africa ? s largest slum , and flying out into wonder : out over the // Great Rift Valley , the cradle of civilization , a three- thousand- mile- long // seam in the earth that stretches from Syria to Mozambique but is at its // most glorious here in Kenya . As the floor of the world dropped away , // opening into endless sky and a breathtaking vista , he would follow this // corridor straight back to her . // There were things she longed to tell him , things only he would understand . // Everything she ? d been too shy and self- effacing to say before // would now come pouring out , just as it had in all of the letters she had // written him , letters she never sent : // A lifetime has passed since we split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together seem as if they happened only the other // day . There is so much I would like to say and share with you  --  now // I know I am not inferior to you . // She waited for him in her blue house beside the lake , which looked // so perfect and placid from the air . But this was merely another extreme // in a country where great beauty coexists with unimaginable brutality , // where the border between life and death is the thinnest of lines , where // nothing is ever as it seems . // Now in contact with others , I realize how knowledgeable I am // about the natural world . . . . People respect me nowadays . But the // only love of my life is one of the few people I can not communicate // with , even as a friend . // She could leave all that pain behind as soon as he came back into her // life . Flying over the mountains and dormant volcanoes that form a natural // amphitheater around the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its wide , verdant , wildlife- infested expanse . // When you flew over and saw the blue house you were probably // happy you didn ? t live here anymore , but I am really such a different // person , I hardly know myself . I have written you so many letters in // my head but when I try to write I go to pieces . // She imagined him buzzing the house , as playfully as he always had , // then touching down on the grass landing strip and stepping out , as if // returning from only a brief safari instead of half a lifetime . Then at last // she would impress him with her independence and accomplishments // and show him the abiding endurance of her love . // Finally , he did come back to her , flying in with the dawn on January // 13 , 2006 . It was not , however , as she had dreamed for so long . He // hadn ? t come to reunite with the woman who had once been his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? d left to live alone in Africa for // sixteen years . // He had come to collect her remains . //
