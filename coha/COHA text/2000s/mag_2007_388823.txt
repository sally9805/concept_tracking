Headnote If you 've ever wondered why good Black men cheat , these women say they know the answer The Mistress She has dated married men for years but insists she 's not trying to break up anybody s home . They just share a bond the wives will never understand ... MY LOVER AND I MET THROUGH WORK . FIRST WE WENT OUT TO DISCUSS BUSINESS , THEN WE MET FOR DRINKS . One night he came back to my place , and that was it . We 've now been seeing each other for five years . He 's 43 and a very successful businessman , and I 'm sure if people knew we were together they 'd think it was all about the money . It 's not . I take care of myself ; I 'm 42 and pay my own bills . I do n't ask him for anything , and he 's never given me much-just an occasional spa treatment . Our relationship is very pure . It 's about unconditional love . When he 's out in the world , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decisions , be in charge . He does n't have to do that with me . I do n't need him to be a Big Willie . I just accept him . When he comes over , I cook for him , give him a massage , and listen to him . I do n't say , " I think you should do this or that . " I just let him talk about what he 's going through . I love him so much there 's nothing he can ask me to do sexually that I wo n't try . He 'll never , ever get a no . I 'm very submissive and let him feel like The King . We do n't discuss what 's going on with his wife , but he 's indicated that we have a sex life that he 's never experienced before . Not to be graphic , but he 's said that a lot of women do n't swallow during oral sex , which really surprises me . But I enjoy going down on him ; I would never pull away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , and I do n't think a lot of women will do that for their man . He does n't ever need to ask . Obviously he is not getting this stuff at home or he 'd be rushing to get there . It 's not very feminist on my part , and it 's definitely not the way I am in the rest of my life , but it 's our dynamic . We really do n't talk about his wife that much . I do n't know what she does for him . Takes care of the house , I guess . I do n't think she understands that her man is out in the world drowning in work and needs to feel like he has a sanctuary . When he 's with me , he 's fed , warm , loved and safe-like a baby . Not to put everything on his wife , but that 's probably what 's missing at home . - AS TOLD TO JEANNINE AMBER The Woman From Brazil Bruna Surfistinha , once the most popular call girl in Sao Paulo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SENSUALITY IN THE WAY WE DRESS . WE look after our bodies so we 'll be in shape to show off our tiny bikinis at the beach and during carnival . We are comfortable with our bodies . It 's why foreign men think we 're experts in sex . That 's not always the case of course , but we work al the illusion . In Brazil , sex is everywhere . Foreign men have told me we are a lot more liberal than their women back home . Brazilian girls will have oral sex and anal sex and enjoy it . And if we do n't enjoy it , we do n't let it show . Brazilian women want to please their men . We will even fake the orgasm . We do whatever it takes to make a man feel that we are enjoying him . When a man hires a call girl , he wants his ego massaged . He wants to hear that he is good in bed , handsome . And men worry about size . Almost every man has asked me if I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was big . Lying was part of my job . When I was with a man , we 'd start by talking about him , what he liked . I 'd laugh and show him I got pleasure from his company . Then maybe I 'd take a shower with him , so we 'd both be clean . Sometimes I would do a striptease . I 'd take my time , without letting him touch me . I also do that with my boyfriend . I buy nice lingerie or a sexy costume and strip it off slowly . When a man is looking at a woman doing something like that for him , he is completely hers . What counts for a man is the body , to see it , to smell it . Men are voyeurs ; they love to watch . They appreciate that I 'm patient . I never make a man feel rushed during sex , and I always cater to his preferences , so I leave him satisfied . Many of the men who came to me confessed that sex had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their wives were more interested in being mothers than in being women . That kills the atmosphere . Sexual love is shoved aside . Women need to take care to say nice things to a man . You have to be sincere , tell him he smells nice , that his body is hot , simple things that put him at ease . The most important thing you can do for a man is compliment him . And seduce him every day . That works for women , too . A loving relationship must allow daily conquests-the game of seduction is crucial . Even if you have kids or a job and you 're tired , always try to treat your man like he 's the same one who decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life with you . - AS TOLD TO ANDREW DOWNIE " The most important thing you can do for a man is compliment him . Tell him he smells nice , that his body is hot . And seduce him every day . " The White Woman Melody* , who 's been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be good to your man , and he 'll be good to you " DATING A BLACK MAN WAS NOT SOMETHING I THOUGHT ABOUT . IT JUST happened . Then again , I have to be honest with myself . I was looking for the total opposite of my former husband , who is short with that typical Italian build . So I found someone tall and dark and completely different . I feel that my man is very considerate . He is patient and calm-all the things my husband was not . My boyfriend does things like fill my car up with gas . And it 's comforting to me to have someone able to fix the car . In my previous relationship , I did n't have that . He 's fine with us making decisions together . If you asked me , I would say I 'm extremely independent . And yet , I do all the cooking . I have absolutely no problem making meals for him . We have big meals on the weekend . We do n't eat prepared food . I suppose Black men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we all want to feel we are being cared for . One thing I 've learned is that you can get that , but you have to give first . My boyfriend feels I am not afraid to take care of him and finds it attractive that my independence is n't threatened . He says it 's not something he experienced when dating Black women . The first Black man I dated also said I had this way of looking out for him , making him feel cared for . He said he did n't get that from Black women . I do n't like to generalize , but I think Black women may feel they 'd be relinquishing their independence and strength . I do n't think that has to be the case . A friend of mine , a Black woman , has a terrible time with men . We have these debates . I say she never cuts men any slack if they screw up . She does n't believe in wasting timeit 's like , next ! But I think people are more complex , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll lose face . But maybe it 's easier for a White woman to do because the life we experience on a daily basis is different from that of Black women . White women are not dealing with the same difficulties , and so for Black women to be asked to give so much more of themselves-well , that has to be tough . - AS TOLD TO TATSHA ROBERTSON * Name has been changed . The Party Girl Juliana* says the reason men spend money buying her drinks in the dub is she 's just fun to be around I 'M IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY , AND A LONG TIME AGO AN OLDER woman gave me a tip about working a party . She said always act as if you 're having the most fun in the room . Men love the fun girl-the one who 'll dance with them , laugh at their jokes , not ask too many hard questions . When I walk into a room , I plant a big smile on my face and make eye contact with everyone . Sometimes I 'll even wink at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always give him a compliment and ask if he 's having a good time . I 'm all about being friendly and open and flirty . It 's such a simple thing , but most Black women do n't do this . We tend to be really cold and stuck up , hostile even . When a man meets someone like me , he 's so relieved not to get the cold shoulder , he 'll spend the whole night buying me drinks . I 'm not looking for a man who 's already attached , but it turns out that most of these guys have girlfriends ; some of them are even married with kids . Of course , they do n't tell me any of this until later-after they 've gotten my number and started to call me at home . Like this one guy I met through a business contact . We started flirting via E-mail , then he called me and confessed he had a live-in girlfriend and a brand-new baby . He said he wanted to tell me because he 's such an " upfront guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only one . I had a boyfriend who cheated on me , so it 's my policy never to sleep with any of these guys . But I admit I like the attention . I like flirting and talking sexy over the phone . It 's nothing their girlfriends ca n't do , but obviously they 're not doing it or these guys would n't be kicking it with me. - AS TOLD TO JEANNINE AMBER * Name has been changed . The Stripper Brown Sugar , 35 , of Magic City Adult Entertainment Club in Atlanta , studies men for a living SOME PEOPLE SAY WE 'RE SLEAZY , WE 'RE HOS , WE 'RE HOME WRECKBRS , BUT that is so off in left field . This is a job . We entertain high rollers and we know what counts to a man . Yes , we dance naked , but that 's not the only reason men keep coming back . The strip industry is a hustle , so you have to know how to approach a man and know how to read him . Say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know he 's got a work problem , a woman problem or some other problem he either wants to forget about or talk about . The men who want to get their freak on and look at some booty , they get a table . I know how to deal with both . You can see when a man 's self-esteem is riding low . I 'll tell him he 's handsome and say things to boost him up . That 's why he comes back . Men like to feel on top . When he 's having problems at home , he might be missing something that his woman wo n't do in bed . I hear men say all the time they 're afraid to ask their woman to do something because they know she 'll go off . When I 'm working , I 'm old school-I like to booty-shake. see , I can lie on the floor and pull my legs behind my head and put them on the floor . And you can hear men say , " Damn ! " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conversation is good , he is going to come back . A guy will return as long as you do n't have sex with him . If you give that up , the game is over . No , this is a tease . It 's a fantasy . Men like fantasy . The rich ones , the poor ones , they all like a challenge . Nobody wants anything that 's easy , and I 'm a true prize . I know how to keep the mystery around me . Say a dark-skinned brother is standing with a group of his friends ; if I see him smile and he has nice teeth , I 'll tap him on the shoulder and say , " You have a beautiful smile , " but then I 'll keep walking . Next thing you know , he 's following me all night . But I do n't allow guys to grope me because I do n't grope them , and I do n't treat them like tricks because who wants to feel like a trick ? No , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit it , men secretly like for a woman to take control . - AS TOLD TO ROSALIND BENTLEY " Men like fantasy . The rich ones , the poor ones , they all like a challenge .
