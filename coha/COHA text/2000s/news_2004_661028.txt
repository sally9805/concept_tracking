<p> Have you ever watched your father tie a necktie and wondered why men wear these things , anyway ? Ties have been part of the business " uniform " for more than 100 years . This week our thoughts turn to ties because some 4.5 million of them are bought around Father 's Day ( which is Sunday , by the way ) . <p> If you laid all those Father 's Day ties end to end , they would stretch from New York to Rome - about 4,120 miles of ties . And the 90 million ties sold each year in the United States would wrap around the globe 3-1/3 times . That 's quite an investment in neckwear . So let 's take a closer look at the necktie : <p> In 1924 , American tailor Jesse Langsdorf patented a process for making a tie . Until the 1920s , ties were made of silk that was cut " with the grain . " Ties made this way had an annoying habit of curling to one side once they were tied . <p> Langsdorf discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut across the grain , or " on the bias , " the ends of the tie ( they 're called " the aprons " ) would hang straight down . Cutting the silk fabric " on the bias " stopped the curl . <p> Langsdorf introduced some other modifications still used to this day . In addition to cutting out the silk on the bias , Langsdorf sewed a tie together in three sections - the two long ends are connected to a shorter piece that goes around the wearer 's neck . Examine a good-quality tie . The seams connecting the pieces run across the fabric diagonally . See them ? <p> Now look at the back of the tie . Can you look up under where the two sides of the tie are sewn together ? You might see a long black thread with a knot at the end . This is the slip-stitch . If you pull on this thread , the tie will bunch up . ( Ask the owner of the tie first if you intend to try this . ) The slip-stitch gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also helps the tie retain its shape when loosened . <p> Quality ties are made from silk , wool , or linen . One of the more common silk weaves is called " rep " ( sometimes " repp " ) . " Rep " somehow evolved from the word " ribbed . " A rep tie is made from silk that 's woven in such a way as to produce tight diagonal ribs that make for deep , brilliant colors . Often , striped ties for schools , clubs , and regiments are rep ties , leading many to believe that rep is short for " reputation . " Not true . <p> There 's wool in that silk tie <p> Ties today are made of an outer shell and a lining . Years ago , silk ties did n't have linings . They were made of silk that was folded seven times and then hand sewn . Ties made this way used a lot of silk , took a lot of work , and were very expensive . <p> Today , instead of being folded seven times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it if you look up under the back of a tie . Notice any gold bars or stripes on the wool cloth ? The number of bars corresponds to the weight of the wool . The more bars , the heavier the wool . But heavier wool does n't necessarily mean a better tie . <p> Tug gently at the place where the tie is sewn all the way up the back . You 'll probably notice that it 's loosely sewn . If so , it was probably sewn by hand . Machine stitches are very tight . Loose hand stitching allows for more " give " when the tie is tied . <p> Thin is ' in , ' then out <p> Over the past century , the width of a tie at its widest part has grown and shrunk . Ties were really skinny in the 1950s - no more than an inch or so . Ties in the late 1960s and early ' 70s were nearly five inches wide . People who know about these sorts of things say that the width of a tie should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lapels , the collar of the shirt worn with it , and how the jacket fits the wearer . When lapels on coats and shirt collars got really wide in the late 1960s , tie widths ballooned . According to today 's fashion , the " perfect " width for a tie is 3-1/4 inches at its widest point . A properly knotted tie should hang down just to the top of the belt buckle . The narrow end of the tie should be a bit shorter than the wide end - never longer . <p> China keeps a secret for centuries <p> When you hear the phrase " Silk Road , " do n't think of a single highway stretching from southern China to Damascus , Syria . Think of interconnected roads weaving from east to west bringing new ideas and merchandise to all the towns and villages along the way . <p> This important trade route had its beginnings more than 2,000 years ago when a Chinese emperor sent an emissary west in search of better horses . Within a couple of decades , Romans saw their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman intellectual , opined that " silk was obtained by removing the down from the leaves with the help of water . " The silk merchants of China had a valuable commodity . They tried to keep the details of silk production secret . For centuries , they succeeded . Everyone was searched at the borders of towns where silk was made . <p> Eventually , though , the secret got out . One story tells of a princess who was going to marry a prince in a far-off western region . She smuggled silkworm eggs in her hair and mulberry seeds in her medicines . <p> Commerce along the Silk Road reached its height in the Tang dynasty ( AD 618-907 . The Chinese sent silk , furs , spices , jade , bronze , iron , and lacquer objects west in exchange for gold , gems , ivory , glass , perfumes , dyes , and textiles . The Silk Road trade route experienced a sharp decline in the 10th century , but Europe 's demand for Asian goods picked up again in the 1200s . <p> Europeans found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was safer , cheaper , and quicker . By this time , Persians and Italians had perfected the art of sericulture ( raising silkworms and spinning silk ) . That lessened the demand for silk from China . <p> Fabric made by insects <p> Silk is produced by the silkworm ( Bombyx Mori ) . The silkworms - caterpillars , actually - feed exclusively on leaves from the mulberry tree . Silkworms eat mulberry leaves nonstop from the time they hatch until the time they start spinning their cocoons a month later . They shed their skins four times to accommodate the weight they gain - 10,000 times their weight at hatching . A ton of mulberry leaves will feed about 36,000 silkworms . <p> To create their cocoons , silkworms secrete a liquid from two glands on their heads , which hardens into a filament of silk upon contact with the air . They spin this silk around themselves in a figure-eight pattern , creating a cocoon from the outside in . A cocoon is made of a single filament more than a mile long . A gummy substance called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silkworm moth would emerge from the cocoon in 10 days . <p> The cocoons are soaked in very hot water . This dilutes the sericin and loosens the end of the filament . Eight to 10 filaments are combined to make a silk thread that 's strong enough for weaving . It takes hundreds of cocoons to create enough silk thread to make a single tie . <p> How it came to be , and what it 's for <p> We know that some Roman legionnaires wore clothes tied around the neck . But the real history of the tie begins in France in the late 1600s . At the conclusion of the Thirty Years ' War in 1648 ( a long and tangled conflict that included Austria , England , France , Denmark , the Netherlands , Spain , Sweden , and Germany ) , a military regiment of soldiers from Croatia was presented to King Louis XIV of France . The King liked their colorful neckerchiefs and ordered his tailors to create some cravates for him . Cravate ( kruh-VAHT ) is the French word for " tie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CROW-at ) . <p> Soon all of French male royalty were wearing cravates ( cravat , in English ) . Over the next 100 years , the fashion spread throughout Europe and to America . Neckwear included anything from piles of lace at the throat , to long droopy bows , to tightly bound cloth . <p> What we would recognize as a necktie came with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the business class . As the uniform for business developed - coat , shirt , trousers - so did the long tie . With the appearance of shirts with permanent collars ( collars used to be detachable ) , long neckties became easier to wear . <p> Ties have n't changed much in 100 years . They get wider or skinnier , and the length may change , but the idea of something that emphasizes the vertical has been a constant principle . <p> Do ties serve a function ? Well , they cover the buttons of a shirt . <p> A knot from the past <p> The most common tie knot is small and precise - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may refer to how the reins fell when a coachman was driving a four-horse carriage . Or it may be the knot the coachman used on his own tie . All we know is that it has something to do with a four-horse carriage . The Windsor knot ( named for the Duke of Windsor in the 1930s ) is much larger . It looks best with a cut-away suit and a shirt with a wide collar . The half-Windsor knot is smaller than the Windsor and larger than the four-in-hand . <p> Rivalries create bonds - and ties <p> As more and more private schools in Britain began competing against one another in sporting events , students looked for ways to display their school colors . First it was with ribbons around their hats , then with scarves . Finally someone thought of a school tie . School ties show the colors of the school displayed in diagonal stripes . ( A curious fact : In Britain , tie stripes slope downward from right to left , like this : /// . But in America , the stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> Military regiments and other organizations soon followed suit , creating ties with their colors or symbols on them . There are many stories on how the colors were chosen . For example , the Royal Tank Corps tie has colors representing the brown mud , red blood , and green fields of Flanders , a famous battlefield of World War I. <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
