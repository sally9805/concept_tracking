Chapter One Speaking Japanese Badly ( 2002 ) Louis Lum 's father began calling him . He called early in the morning and late at night to say he wanted to run down Hersey Collins with his car , or crush his skull with a brick . His father never called him at work to discuss such matters , and for that measure of decorum Louis was grateful . " Does n't sound like a good idea , " Louis would say . " Have you been riding your exercise bike ? " Day after day his father 's desire remained unchanged . The old man wanted to end Hersey Collins , who five months before had fallen asleep at the wheel and crashed head-on into Louis 's mother 's car on a narrow stretch of Springdale Street . " Man should n't have been driving , " his father said . " Had no business being on the road . " Louis suggested they go to church . " It 'll get you out of the house . " " I 'll have to wake up Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll get to be around people . " The last time he had attended Golden Harvest Baptist was five years ago , and Louis wanted to return with his father now because he remembered how mellow everyone was at church . His mother had been a longstanding member of the congregation . She 'd laughed and poducked with her fellow Baptists , none of whom everexpressed a desire to crack someone 's neck with a hammer . Louis hoped church would calm his father and convince him that physical violence was not the right course of action . The old man continued calling to say , " I ca n't believe he 's still free on the streets . I want to kill him . " Louis stopped picking up the phone . He let his machine answer his father 's threats and then called back to say , " Got your message . Do n't do it . Let 's go to church . " His father eventually agreed to go and Louis picked him up the following Sunday . They did n't talk on the drive over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cul-de-sac in Anaheim . The neighboring buildings housed machine and sewing shops ; anyone who did n't have business on this street would have no reason to be here . They arrived ten minutes late and sat on steel folding chairs near the back exit . In front of them were three rows of chairs facing an old wooden lectern , behind which Pastor Elkin stood . He said , " Do n't be shy , " and motioned for Louis and his father to come forward and sit with the rest of the congregation . Before Louis could respond , his father said , " Thanks , but we 're good here . " Pastor Elkin spoke into a microphone and his voice echoed through two overhead speakers , one of which hung directly above Louis and delivered the sermon with a thumping bass . The cement floor was flecked with sawdust left over from the parties held by the German Association of Orange County and Boy Scout Troops 145 and 167 . During the week , retired Germans clinked steins and chatted here , and boys drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Louis 's father shifted continuously throughout the hour-long service , stretching his legs , pulling them back , the steel joints of the chair whining under his weight . During the closing question-and-answer session that followed the doxology and benediction , his father stood and asked over the mostly gray heads of the twenty-five congregation members : " If someone beat up your brother , would n't you feel obligated to beat him up ? I 've beaten up people on account of my brother . Yeah , we were kids at the time . " If someone stole a hundred dollars from you and you had a chance to see him again , you would n't feel tempted to punch him ? What about a slap ? Because he did you wrong . " If someone slaps you , you would n't slap him back ? It stings , you know , to be slapped . Come on , you know you 'd do it . " Each response that came back from Pastor Elkin was an unequivocal no . No from the pastor . No from the congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis fidgeted in his seat while his father posed so many variations of the same question that Pastor Elkin eventually asked , " Something you want to talk about , Sonny ? " " No , " his father said , " nothing at all . " Louis 's mother had brought him to church because she 'd wanted him to accept Jesus into his heart . She 'd said it was required for getting into Heaven . " It 's like getting a passport , and once you get it you do n't have to worry about going to Hell . " " If I get my passport , why do I have to keep going to church ? " Louis had asked . " Because I 'm not giving you a choice . " He 'd been the only child attending services filled with people in their forties and fifties . " A handsome boy , " they 'd say . " So smart . " " Not so bright , " his mother would respond . " Terrible in geography . Does n't know Cameroon from Ghana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his grandfather . His paternal grand- father . " " Why do you tell them I 'm creepy looking ? " he 'd asked on the drive home . " I was being humble for you , " his mother said , her eyes fixed on the road . " If they want to say I 'm handsome , why do you have to say I look creepy ? " " You do n't look creepy . People will like you more if you do n't accept their praise . If you tell them you 're slow-witted and clumsy , they 'll think you 're the opposite . " " They 'll think I 'm slow-witted and clumsy . " " It 's called humility . " Louis believed church had been like a party for his mother and she had n't wanted to attend alone . She 'd press his Sunday suit Saturday night and slick his hair with gel Sunday morning . His father should have been the one to sacrifice his Sunday mornings to accompany her , but she said , " He decided long ago he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ? He said , ' I 'd go straight to Hell in exchange for sleeping in Sundays for the rest of my life . Do you have any idea how tired I am by the time I get to Sunday ? ' " I said , ' Hey buddy , you 're not the only one who works fifty-plus hours a week . You do n't have to stay up nights prepping for lectures . You do n't have to grade exams on your weekends . ' " He told me to stop nagging him , and I was only trying to do him a favor . " When , as a child , Louis asked his father to go to church , he answered , " Why should I ? " and his mother said , " Do n't nag him . He wants to go to Hell . " Louis had asked his father to go so he himself could sleep in . More important , he had n't wanted his father to go to Hell . He first heard Pastor Elkin 's sermon on damnation when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where eternal flames melted the skin off your body , on which baseball-sized boils swelled and exploded , jetting out thick streams of greasy black pus onto the black streets , where packs of the wild dead-with their eternally melting skin and continuously erupting boils-hunted down and vomited on each other . " Now do n't you want Jesus to come into your heart ? " his mother asked on the drive home . That night he prayed , " Jesus , please come into my heart . " He made the same request every night for six months , and asked Pastor Elkin if there was a limit to how many times he could do it . " I 'm sure once is enough , " Pastor Elkin said . Louis did n't believe him and continued inviting Jesus until the end of the year . Jesus , he believed , was someone who looked like Max von Sydow , who handed out fish and bread to new arrivals , and who said , " See , I told you so , " as they passed through what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver . The day after high school graduation , Louis announced he was finished with church . " I invited Jesus into my heart three hundred and twenty-four times , " he told his mother . " I 'm going to Heaven . " Saturday had been his only day to sleep in and he wanted his Sunday mornings back . " You 're eighteen and I ca n't force you to keep going , " she said . She was upset and disappointed and he felt bad for her . However , the next Sunday he slept in until noon and woke up to one of the most refreshing and happy Sundays he 'd ever had . In the five years since he 'd last attended Golden Harvest with her , no one new had joined the congregation , which now consisted of the same twenty-five people week in and week out . The youngest members looked at least fifty . Many looked sixty and over . Louis felt like he was watching a species in its final years , the last clan of Atlantic seabirds being killed off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not one left and no evidence they 'd ever existed . There were never curious visitors who happened to drop in . There were no children and no one who seemed capable of a short sprint , or even a light jog around the block . Hairs were gray and silver , skin was cracked , and life was always a burst blood vessel away from ending . At the end of each service , Pastor Elkin would say , " Let us continue trying to bring in new sheep , " and the congregation would say , " Amen . " A month into their churchgoing , Louis 's father ran into congregation member Arnold Mannion at an Albertson 's and asked him a question . Arnold said there was no way he 'd ever slap somebody back . " You 're not being honest , " Louis 's father said . " You can slap me if you want . " " Are you serious ? " " Please , " Arnold said . " He told me to , " Louis 's father said on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his groceries down and waited for me to do it . " " What happened ? " Louis asked . " I slapped him . " " Hard ? " " There was a loud pop . His faced turned pink . I did n't hit him that hard . He has delicate skin . " " Was n't he mad ? " " No . He hugged me . He said , ' Good , get your grief out . ' Then he smiled . " Louis 's father looked puzzled . " What kind of a person asks to get slapped and smiles after ? " Louis shrugged and kept his eyes on the road ahead . The church members often related personal testimonies that involved the importance of forgiveness . At each service , some- one stood in front of the congregation and told a story about how he 'd invited for dinner a coworker who 'd " borrowed " his soda from the company fridge , or how he 'd brought apple fritters to a neighbor whose dogs crapped on his front lawn . That morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lum slapped me last week . I was happy to help him vent his frustration . " Pastor Elkin nodded . Louis 's father stood from his seat in the back and shouted , " He asked me to do it ! It was consensual ! " " That 's right , " Arnold said , and cries of " Sweet Jesus ! " and " Yes Lord ! " echoed through the room . " Nobody 's blaming you , " Pastor Elkin told Louis 's father . " Arnold wanted to help you . He asked you to vent your frustration because he hoped it would make you feel better . " " He can slap me back , " Louis 's father said . " He has the right . Come on , Arnold , you know you want to . " Louis pulled his father back down . " What kind of a church is this ? " his father asked on the drive home . He was disappointed to learn that Golden Harvest would not deviate from the forgiveness of the New Testament , the turning-the-other-cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjustifiable formula for present-day life , and because of this Louis 's father decided to stop attending . The next Sunday Louis slept well past noon . Louis was making a living as an editorial assistant at a hot rod magazine based in Mission Viejo , and the salary afforded rent for a studio apartment in Santa Ana , utilities , car insurance , gas , and food , with twenty dollars left over each month . Two years ago , he 'd graduated from college and taken the job mostly because it was all he could get and partly to annoy his mother . " Nineteen a year ? " she 'd asked . " You have a college degree . " She 'd believed having a B.A. meant working for no less than thirty a year . " This is insulting , " she 'd said . He had n't felt insulted , but her resistance to his job had heightened his enjoyment of it . He found satisfaction in doing or saying things she did n't want him to do or say . He would never have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was dead , he felt he should have found something with a higher salary and a more respectable title . He could use the extra money . He could use a vacation . A quiet room in a distant land . A long stay to forget about Hersey , the accident , and his father 's rage . He wanted to sleep on foreign soil , somewhere where nobody knew him and he knew nobody-Auckland , Toronto , Yonkers . He was a fact checker and he did his job well . The copy chief handed him so many EA of the Month awards that he was eventually declared the permanent EA of the Month . His picture hung on the wall in the front lobby under a giant portrait of Percy , the Chihuahua that belonged to the publisher 's wife . In addition , he was assigned a leather reclining chair with oak armrests . It was the most luxurious chair ever given to an EA . All the others had standard-issue rollers with synthetic fabric and poor back support . Louis 's mother had lived by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else who 's doing it , or find something else to do . " A week before the accident , they 'd spoken on the phone and he 'd told her about his chair . " It 's the best chair for someone in your position ? " she 'd asked . " Yes . " " Leather , you said ? " " Yes . " " Better than nothing . " Two weeks after quitting Golden Harvest , Louis 's father called and said , " I 'm driving to his house . I have a knife . I 'm going to stab him in the heart . " It was one in the morning , and the old man was n't being rude by calling because neither of them went to bed before two or three . " You sure you want to do this ? " Louis asked . " Yes . " " Really ? " " Yes . " " You really going to his house ? " " No . But I plan to . " " You 're home ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm really thinking about going there . I can do it . " " I know . Stay right there . " Hersey Collins was a twenty-seven-year-old first-year resident at UCI Medical driving home after a forty-eight-hour shift when he nodded out . The wheel had slipped from his fingers and turned his car directly into her path . The total strength of impact had equaled their velocities combined , eight thousand pounds of steel and glass crashing at one hundred miles an hour . He 'd been lucky . He 'd been driving the much bigger car , a gray Land Cruiser that 'd crushed her Camry . The paramedics had found her body in the backseat , along with the steering wheel and most of the dash . Louis arrived at his father 's house and found him sitting on the driveway , wearing a white T-shirt , gray sweats , and sandals . " I have to do something to him . " His father stood and walked back into the house . Louis followed . " You retiled the hallway . " " Took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks nice . " Louis walked into the living room . " You repainted the walls . " " Yeah . " The carpet had been replaced by dark brown hardwood . " I should n't have called , " his father said . " You can go home . " " You ca n't just call , tell me what you told me , and tell me to go home . " " I 'm fine . " Louis was angry at Hersey 's carelessness , but he had no desire to kill the man . What Hersey should n't have done was wait for Louis 's father at the hospital , offer his apologies , address , and number , and say , " If there 's anything I can do for you , I 'll do it . " He should have gone home . " Sorry I woke you , " Louis 's father said . " Say , ' I wo n't kill Hersey Collins . ' " His father said nothing . " You never said you were driving to his house before , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " " Is my bed still here ? " " Yes . " " I 'll sleep here tonight . " They got up for work the next morning , and Louis came back at four sharp to make sure his father returned soon after . They watched TV that evening , and repeated this pattern of work and TV until the end of the week , when he asked his father , " Do you still want to kill him ? " " Yes . " Another week passed . Each time Louis asked the question , his father said , " Yes . " " If you say you wo n't drive to his house , even if you want to , I 'll leave , " Louis said . " I 'll go back to my place . " " I do n't want to lie . " " Do n't you want this house back to yourself ? " His father did n't answer . " Why do you want to do it ? What good would it do ? " " It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And now I 'm hobbling around and he 's walking fine with two good legs . " ( Continues ... )
