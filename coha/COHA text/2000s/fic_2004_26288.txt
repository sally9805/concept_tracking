Focus Focus Focus Click ! Masklin slid cautiously down an old burger carton . He 'd been watching humans . Hundreds and hundreds of humans . It was beginning to dawn on him that getting on a jet plane was n't like stealing a truck . Angalo and Gurder had nestled deep into the rubbish and were gloomily eating the remains of a cold , greasy french fry . This has come as a shock to all of us , Masklin thought . I mean , take Gurder . Back in the Store he was the Abbot . He believed that Arnold Bros made the Store for nomes . And he still thinks there 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we are important . And now we 're out here , and all we 've found is that nomes are n't important at all . . . . And there 's Angalo . He does n't believe in Arnold Bros , but he likes to think Arnold Bros exists just so that he can go on not believing in him . And there 's me . I never thought it would be this hard . I thought jet planes were just trucks with more wings and less wheels . There 's more humans in this place than I 've ever seen before . How can we find Grandson Richard , 39 , in a place like this ? I hope they 're going to save me some of that potato . . . . Angalo looked up . " Seen him ? " he said , sarcastically . Masklin shrugged . " There 's lots of humans with beards , " he said . " They all look the same to me . " " I told you , " said Angalo . " Blind faith never works . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , " said Masklin . " He could have walked right past me . " " So let 's get back , " said Angalo . " People will be missing us . We 've made the effort , we 've seen the airport , we 've nearly got trodden on dozens of times . Now let 's get back to the real world . " " What do you think , Gurder ? " said Masklin . The Abbot gave him a long , despairing look . " I do n't know , " he said . " I really do n't know . I 'd hoped . . . " His voice trailed off . He looked so downcast that even Angalo patted him on the shoulder . " Do n't take it so hard , " he said . " You did n't really think some sort of Grandson Richard , 39 , was going to swoop down out of the sky and carry us off to Florida , did you ? Look , we 've given it a try . It has n't worked . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think that , " said Gurder irritably . " I just thought that . . . maybe in some way . . . there 'd be a way . " " The world belongs to humans . They built everything . They run everything . We might as well accept it , " said Angalo . Masklin looked at the Thing . He knew it was listening . Even though it was just a small black cube , it somehow always looked more alert when it was listening . The trouble was , it spoke only when it felt like it . It 'd always give you just enough help , and no more . It seemed to be testing him the whole time . Somehow , asking the Thing for help was like admitting that you 'd run out of ideas . But . . . " Thing , " he said , " I know you can hear me , because there must be loads of electricity in this building . We 're at the airport . We ca n't find Grandson Richard , 39 . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Thing stayed silent . " If you do n't help us , " said Masklin quietly , " we 'll go back to the quarry and face the humans , but that wo n't matter to you because we 'll leave you here . We really will . And no nomes will ever find you again . There will never be another chance . We 'll die out , there will be no more nomes anywhere , and it will be because of you . And in years and years to come you 'll be all alone and useless and you 'll think , Perhaps I should have helped Masklin when he asked me , and then you 'll think , If I had my time all over again , I would have helped him . Well , Thing , imagine all that has happened and you 've magically got your wish . Help us . " " It 's a machine ! " snapped Angalo . " You ca n't blackmail a machine ! " One small red light lit up on the Thing 's black surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thinking , " said Masklin . " But can you tell what nomes are thinking ? Read my mind , Thing , if you do n't think I 'm serious . You want nomes to act intelligently . Well , I am acting intelligently . I 'm intelligent enough to know when I need help . I need help now . And you can help . I know you can . If you do n't help us , we 'll leave right now and forget you ever existed . " A second light came on , very faintly .
