Three clusters in Auriga have a connection to 17th-century Sicily and an astronomer who was hunting for nebulae. // FROM MIDNORTHERN LATITUDES , AURIGA , THE CHARIoteer , can be found straight overhead on February evenings . Its distinctive pentagon of bright stars with brilliant Capella - also known as Alpha ( alpha ) Aurigae - at one corner makes this an easy constellation to spot . Auriga is extremely rich in deep-sky treasures , many easily visible through small telescopes . Notice that one of the stars in the pentagon seems to be shared with the neighboring constellation Taurus , the Bull . Long ago it was not uncommon for constellations to share a star , but when the International Astronomical Union set the constellation boundaries in 1929 , this star was placed within Taurus and is now officially Beta ( beta ) Tauri . This month we focus on M36 , M37 , and M38 - three open clusters discovered by the Sicilian Giovanni Hodierna ( 1597  --  1660 ) . A tract containing his observations was published in 1654 and rediscovered only recently . Hodierna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky that appear as small clouds to the naked eye but show themselves to be made of stars close together when seen through a telescope . We 'll start with M38 , buried deep in the heart of the pentagon . It is located 7.2 deg due north of beta Tauri and makes a nearly equilateral triangle with that star and Iota ( t ) Aurigae . M38 is visible through a finder as a small hazy spot . With my 105-millimeter refractor at 68x , I see about 60 stars of 8th magnitude and fainter in an area around 20 ' across , but the boundaries are ill defined . The cluster has a distinctive shape , with a lone 9.7  --  magnitude star centered in a 5 ' hole nearly devoid of stars . Many of the brighter stars radiate from this central dark zone in four arms , making a cross with the longer bar running west-southwest to east-northeast . M38 's brightest member , an 8.4-magnitude yellowish star lying at the eastnortheast edge of the cluster , marks the foot of the cross . Increasing the magnification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star count to about 80 . At 87x my scope has a 53 ' true field , which lets me shoehorn M38 into the same view with neighboring NGC 1907 . This little star cluster lies south-southwest of M38 and is about 6 ' across . Through my refractor I see a rich sprinkling of very faint stars over a hazy background , with one slightly brighter star east of center . A matched pair of 10th-magnitude stars adorns the south-southeast edge . // Left The open clusters M38 ( top ) and NGC 1907 ( bottom ) lie buried in the heart of Auriga . M38 has more than 300 stars , some arranged in chains radiating from the center . NGC 1907 is a compact cluster of fewer than 100 stars about 1/2 deg south-southwest of its companion . // Left : On this chart ( and in all photographs ) north is up and east is left .

It makes a very squat isosceles triangle with beta Tauri and Theta ( theta ) Aurigae and is visible through a finder . My refractor at 87x shows 50 moderately bright to faint stars in a loose group about 15 ' across . Multiple curving arms composed of the brighter stars radiate from the center . You can see a pair of 9th-magnitude stars ( sigma737 ) eastsoutheast of center , and a wider pair of 10th-magnitude stars ( Sei 350 ) south of center . The stars of M36 look as if they were scooped from a spot just south of the cluster where we find a void of about the same size . This is the dark nebula 8226 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our final open cluster , M37 , is 3.7 deg east-southeast of M36 and is the brightest of the bunch . Look for it approximately as far outside Auriga 's pentagon as M36 is inside it . M37 is the stunner of Hodierna 's three Auriga clusters . My refractor at 87x reveals an extremely rich flurry of faint stars gathered in clumps scattered around a central , orangish magnitude-9.1 star . Dark lanes and patches abound , threaded among the teeming swarms of stars . This beautiful confusion of stars is one of my favorite deep-sky sights . Giovanni Hodierna was one of the first astronomers in Sicily to grasp the importance of Galileo 's new ideas . His instruments were simple Galilean refractors , the only known example having a magnification of 20x and a limiting magnitude of about 8 . He systematically swept the sky , planning to publish a sky atlas with 100 maps on which he would include his nebulous objects . Hodierna never completed the work and only a few samples of his observations remain , which nevertheless appear to include 46 objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to identify , but of the " nebulae " he observed , at least 10 seem to be original discoveries . This is quite extraordinary when we consider that during the same youthful era of the telescope , the rest of the astronomical community discovered just one such object , the Orion Nebula . Hodierna believed that " all the admirable objects that can be seen in the sky " could be resolved into stars if it were not for the limitations of his telescope . He speculated that the apparent brightness of these stars could depend not only on their intrinsic brightness but also on their distances . He entertained the idea that the distribution of stars might seem disordered to our view because they were ordered about some other spot in the universe . As a religious man in an era when putting the Sun at the center of the universe was still dangerous , Hodierna was quite daring to discuss , even hypothetically , a center much farther away . Due to Hodierna 's relative isolation and a general lack of interest in stellar astronomy at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's remember them as we gaze at the clusters of Auriga and appreciate the fact that he would have welcomed the humblest of our telescopes as marvelous instruments . // This Month 's Objects // Top : Like its companions in Auriga , the open cluster M36 looks somewhat like a hazy star against the backdrop of the Milky Way . Increased magnification opens up its crowded core . Bottom : The most beautiful and richly populated cluster in Auriga is M37 . Look for an orange star at its heart , surrounded by clumps of stars and dark lanes . Author Affiliation SUE FRENCH gazes at clusters from upstate New York .
