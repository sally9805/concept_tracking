Since then , she has received a number of awards and national praise , including the Kennedy family 's Profile in Courage Lantern . Wills ' story is especially compelling because she managed to turn tragedy into triumph by emphasizing the potentially transforming power of tragedy . In speeches to local and national audiences , the 19year United States Army veteran praises God for sparing her life and the lives of others .

According to published reports , the $20 million man was born Mark Vincent on July 18 , 1967 , to Delora , 58 , an Italian psychologist/astrologer , and a Black or biracial father Diesel says he has never met . But that 's not the end of the story . Diesel 's twin brother has blond hair and blue eyes .

The big question is , how long can Barry Bonds just keep going and going and going and .... ? And how long can the milestones just keep coming and coming and coming ?

The general belief is that the 11-time All-Star is a good bet to have his name etched into another spot in the history books . But there are many fans who are wondering about three important situations that could derail his assault on history . Will pitchers give him anything to hit on a consistent basis ?

The 30-year-old 's tragic and untimely death stunned her fans and raised many questions about her life .

Suzan-Lori Parks , the first African-American female playwright to win a Pulitzer Prize for drama , does n't write to win awards .

Parks , who is married to blues musician Paul Oscher , may be best known for the 1995 original screenplay , Girl 6 , produced and directed by Spike Lee .

" And if they call the police , he once said during an interview , he 'll come back and spank them after he gets out . It 's the way Mac raised his own daughter as well as the two nieces and nephew he took in while his sister recovered from drug abuse , an event the show is partially based on .

He also became the youngest judge in Michigan 's history , and his streetwise style and no-nonsense manner-a legacy of his no-nonsense mother-attracted the cameras to his courtroom and led to his television show . Mathis has authored a book on his life , Inner City Miracle , and his life story has been produced as a play and as a television documentary designed to help troubled youths turn their lives around . He believes that rehabilitation is within everyone 's reach if they receive the right guidance . Married and the father of four children , he and his wife co-founded Young Adults Asserting Themselves , a nonprofit youth agency .

But whatever the outcome , McCall , who ran a brilliant campaign , strengthened his position as a center of initiative in the new Democratic Party .

Irving Rhames grew up on the gritty Harlem neighborhood streets surrounded by drug dealers , pimps and murderers-yet he was a well-spoken A-student who earned a theater scholarship to the prestigious Juilliard School of Drama . And unlike some actors who openly admit to pursuing their career relentlessly , Rhames , who had originally set his sights on a football career , says that his career choice was sanctioned by God .

The prediction is that the record should be his somewhere around the seventh game . Whenever records are broken , the debate starts anew on who is the best in history .

First there were three tenors-Jose Carreras , Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti . Then there were Three Mo ' TenorsThomas Young , Victor Trent Cook and Roderick Dixon-who were expected by some audiences and critics to be the three tenors , in color . But before people could say mia mia , Three Mo ' Tenors reversed the terms of comparison and became a standard themselves . In 2002 , they played major halls across the country , and some critics said out loud that Three Mo ' Tenors had redefined the genre .

The onstage chemistry of the trio can be attributed in part to the unique friendship that the tenors share offstage . Like three siblings , the tenors travel together , shop together , tell jokes together , and complete each other 's sentences . They are very different personalities , however . Young , a widower , lives on the outskirts of New York and is the patriarch of the trio ; Brooklyn native Cook is single and is the lively sparkplug ; and Dixon , a native New Yorker , currently lives in Chicago with his wife and brings a balance between the two extremes .
