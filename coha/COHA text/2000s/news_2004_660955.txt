<p> Julia Mesina , her husband , and their three young children faced a dire situation . He 'd lost his job , and their savings soon dried up . His parents , in Naperville , Ill. , offered to help out . Before long , the young family moved in . <p> Scott McDowell , on the other hand , says he needed a break . The student at the Berklee College of Music also needed to save money - a difficult feat while paying rent in Boston . He decided to move back home in Marin County in California for a year . <p> Melody , a senior at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles , never even left home . She stayed with her mom during college to save on room and board , but it strained their relationship ; Melody suspects her mother still sees her as a teenager . <p> For those who remember adulthood as beginning definitively at 18 , it 's a different world today . Julia , Scott , and Melody are among a growing number of 20-somethings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after they are legally considered adults . <p> Between 1970 and 1990 the number of 20-somethings living at home increased by 50 percent , according to the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan . Today , 63 percent of college students say they plan to live with their parents after graduating , according to JobTrak . <p> Young adults are flocking back to the nest for varying reasons , but the trend is now so pronounced that many sociologists and psychologists no longer define them as full-fledged adults but rather as " emerging adults , " a term coined by sociologist Jeffrey Arnett . <p> " I became convinced that it 's a mistake to just talk about them as making a transition to adulthood , " says Dr. Arnett , at the University of Maryland . " It 's really a separate period in life . They 're not settled into a long-term occupation . They 're not married by and large . Their lives are still very much in flux . " <p> While a lagging job market , unaffordable housing , and modest first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also contributed to what Arnett calls a " quiet revolution . " <p> The shift has more to do with parenting than with money , says Daphne Stevens , a psychotherapist in Macon , Ga . " Speaking as a baby boomer , I think we just wanted to be buddies with our children , " she says . " We did n't want to be old like our parents . " <p> Susan Shaffer , coauthor of the book " Mom , Can I Move Back In With You ? " to be released in May , could n't agree more . " Our generation grew up with very clear expectations - an inevitability of living on our own when we reached our 20s . Our children have grown up with a very close generation , where the parents were highly involved . And that did n't stop at some mythical , magical age . " <p> In many parts of the world , children rely on their parents well into adulthood . In Canada , for instance , 41 percent of 20-somethings live with their parents , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Asian cultures , many children do n't leave the house for college at all . <p> But in America , where previous generations of young people have reached traditional markers of adulthood - a career , a home , a spouse - just out of high school or college , staying close to home is n't always easy - for the parents or their children . <p> When Mrs. Mesina moved in with her husband 's parents , it was one of the most difficult choices she made in her adult life . Not only do she and her husband have less privacy in her parents-in-law 's home , but she also feels a twinge of guilt for taking up their space , cutting into their retirement savings , and simply relying on them at all . <p> " Two families coming together is a hard thing , " says Julia , a stay-at-home mom . " We 'd like to let them have their space and do what they want . They worked their lives , and we want them to use their money in ways they want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mesina says , for the sake of her family as well as her parents-in-law . " People have to learn how to live with what they have as much as possible , " she reminds herself . <p> When Mr. McDowell moved back home , it was not out of necessity but rather the most practical way to save money . The California native had n't yet graduated from Berklee in Boston , but he had to undergo an operation and wanted to do it at home . <p> " I needed a break , " he says , now back in Boston after a year of living with his parents in California 's Marin County . " I had gone to school straight through the summer , so I just needed time away from school ... I also had a lot of different projects and ventures that I wanted to explore , and I did n't have time to do that while working hard to pay an expensive monthly rent . " <p> A large factor - some would say problem - is that many parents do n't teach their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen Gallo , founders of the Gallo Institute and authors of " Silver Spoon Kids . " <p> " Our book is about growing up in an affluent time , even if your family is n't affluent , " Ms. Gallo says . " How do you raise children in this kind of environment ? " <p> Her husband says parents should introduce the concept of money and budgeting to their children at an early age . <p> " We 'd have fewer kids moving back home if they were aware of what the learning curve looks like , " he says . Because parents " do n't teach the rudiments of dealing with money , i.e. , budgeting , cost of credit , " children can remain financially dependent until their mid or late 20s . <p> But Arnett defends the close relationship between 20-somethings and their parents today . " Emerging adults tend to get along better with their parents than adolescents do . It 's less hierarchical . " <p> But moving in with parents is n't always the best option , he says . " It still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get comments on how you 're spending money , what time you 're coming home , why you 're eating that doughnut . Most emerging adults would prefer not to have that sage advice imposed at that point . " <p> Melody , who was once prom queen of her high school in Los Angeles , did n't leave home at all . She avoided costly dormitory rent and grocery bills by staying with her mother . But Melody , who asked that her last name not be used , was missing out on the social aspects of college life . <p> As time passed , her relationship with her mother grew strained . Because she never left home , she worried that her mother saw her as an adolescent . She began to resent her curfew . Eventually , disagreements between Melody and her mother became so fierce that they would n't talk for days . She felt she had to leave . <p> " I 'm scared though , " she says . " I ca n't do things that other people my age can do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't even make pancakes for myself . " <p> Parents , of course , face similar hurdles in learning to handle a young adult who is dependent in some ways and independent in others . <p> Ms. Stevens , a mother of three , one of whom moved back home recently , sympathizes with parents , many of whom struggle to adapt to life with their adult offspring : " I ... tell parents that the story is never written . Children are always doing their work growing , and we 're always doing our work growing , and everything we do , and every way we 've been hurt , can become a way of learning . " <p> In the grand scheme of things , Stevens supposes , this adjustment is the flip side of the empty nest syndrome . Major life changes are always difficult ; kids going , kids coming , the constant need to be flexible . But while leaning on a parent - or even a child - has its advantages , " None of us feels good about ourselves when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " she says . <p> * Sheera Frenkel contributed to this report . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
