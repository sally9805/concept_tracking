<p> Two weeks ago in an Arena Football League game few people cared enough about to watch , a 35-year-old quarterback named John Kaleo called a play for himself and plunged headlong over the goal line for a touchdown . He did this knowing his frame would be pummeled to the ground , perhaps even knocked into the hockey sideboards that line the field and that the hit would be the worst of the night in a brand of football that has proven more violent than even the NFL . <p> His teammate on the Columbus Destroyers , a gargantuan lineman named Kelvin Kinney who once played defensive end for the Washington Redskins , later shook his head and winced at the memory . <p> He figured it might have been the most impressive thing he had seen Kaleo do . But that would be forgetting the running leap into the end zone the quarterback made in the league 's championship game three years ago , when they were teammates in Tampa Bay , as well as the countless other times he called for a bootleg right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " He 's a tough little guy , " Kinney said . <p> Maybe this recklessness in such an unadorned setting would make more sense if Kaleo were destitute or desperate for one last shot at the NFL . But those dreams ended the moment his career at Maryland was over in 1992 . He now has a wife and two sons waiting for him at home , which is in a gated community in a fashionable part of Tampa . He also has a degree in criminology from Maryland and a lucrative real estate career in Florida should he want to pursue it . <p> So why spend year after year risking his neck in a sport that barely registers on the national consciousness ? <p> " It 's a good question , " Kaleo said . <p> And yet just moments into a conversation with him the answer is obvious . His eyes flash , his jaw sets and the memories of all the football men who summed him up with a cursory glance and deemed him too tiny to play welled up inside . <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NFL scouts all shook their heads and told him no , he still has to show them how silly they were . How they should n't have been so quick to judge the body and not the heart of John Kaleo . <p> " Let me say this , " he said . " I 've always been told I ca n't , I was too small , too short to play Division I football , that I did n't have the arm to play professional , that I did n't do this or could n't do that . And that 's always driven me from high school all the way through and that 's what keeps driving me  --  that people , despite all the service I put in , say , ' Ah you know , Kaleo 's not this or Kaleo ca n't throw the deep ball or Kaleo is just an average quarterback . ' <p> " I keep proving them wrong every year . " <p> And , now at 6 feet and 205 pounds , he 's spent 13-plus seasons in a league with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ceiling trying to prove it . <p> " I think it 's a pride thing that keeps me going , " Kaleo said . <p> One could say this league in which he has chosen to live out his athletic life is one of underdogs , still very much a minor league . Occasionally , a player will emerge and attain NFL stardom  --  the two most celebrated being Kurt Warner and Tommy Maddox . Most , however , seem to live in a professional sports vacuum , playing nationally televised games that few people watch and whose results rarely make the papers outside of the cities where they play . <p> Columbus 's workouts are held in an indoor soccer facility on the north side of town . After every practice the players have to pull down the giant pads that offer their only protection from the sideboards and lug the padding to a storage area on the other side of the building . <p> Players do this with a fair amount of grumbling , yet a shared sense of duty . For most of them it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . <p> " If you talk to a rookie just out of college , they tell you they play for love , " said Destroyers linebacker Leroy Thompson , who is in his 11th season . " You talk to a 35-year-old man and it 's all about the money . I would have a nine-to-five job right now if I was n't doing this . " <p> Kaleo seems to fall somewhere in the middle . He loves the game but admits that the salary  --  more than $100,000 in his case as a star quarterback  --  makes for a nice part-time job . <p> But he has paid for his devotion . In his career , five teams have folded , including one that declared bankruptcy the last week of the season , denying players their final paychecks . He 's on his 10th club  --  almost all of them rebuilding projects . He said he 's proud to have a winning lifetime record as a quarterback , which is probably a challenge given the teams he has been a part of . Columbus , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the season , the Destroyers are a win away from tying the franchise record for victories , which is six . <p> The longest he has played for one team was four years , that was when he won the league championship with Tampa Bay in 2003 . It was probably his greatest memory  --  until he discovered that the championship ring he had been presented was made of cubic zirconia . Still , he remains loyal to the only league that gave him an opportunity , laughing about the days when teams traveled to road games in vans , which players then tried to commandeer for late-night excursions . He notes with pride that teams now fly and stay in nice hotels rather than just jump on buses and have pizza and beer on all-night drives home after games . <p> " If there is a consummate Arena League player , John is probably it , " Columbus Coach Doug Kay said . " John may not feel that is a compliment , but he 's really dedicated himself to the game . " <p> It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his AFL career  --  he has been benched , won starting jobs , demanded a trade ( once ) and tore his anterior cruciate ligament ( twice ) , causing him to miss the 1998 season and most of 2002 . He even watched in horror as one of his teammates  --  Al Lucas  --  a friend who used to play with his sons , died in a game in Los Angeles last year . <p> Still , he has endured . <p> In 13-plus seasons he has thrown for more than 30,000 yards and more than 500 touchdowns . While it is a league designed to produce great offensive numbers , his nonetheless are among the league 's best . <p> " The fact of the matter is if two years were n't taken away from me because of injuries or whatever I would be number one in every passing category , in touchdown yards and everything , " he said . <p> Then he shrugs . He is n't complaining , just stating a fact . What can he do ? <p> His father was a fighter , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Kaleo Sr. lied about his age to enter his first boxing match in Baltimore and proceeded to fight some 65 more times over the next several years . Nine of those fights were as a professional . When asked for his father 's record , he is vague , eventually saying he thinks he lost about 17 of those fights . <p> Still , boxing gave John Sr. dedication to a task , something he passed down when his son expressed a desire to play football in their home town of Davidsonville in Anne Arundel County . In the evenings he took John Jr . to the local school and said they would work out  --  together . <p> They ran a hill behind the football field , racing up as many as 15 times to a water tower at the top . Then they would race up and down the steps of the football field 's stands with John Sr. always shouting to his boy , " You 've got to pay the price if you want to make it . " <p> So John pushed , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback of a football team that ran the option . He spent his senior year at Bowie High , where he had transferred , thinking that a more traditional passing attack would showcase his skills . <p> But it was n't until he came into contact with Mike Hohensee , a former quarterback for the USFL 's Washington Federals who became Kaleo 's position coach at Montgomery College in Rockville , that the young passer blossomed . <p> Where taller , stronger quarterbacks struggled with the complexities of offenses , Kaleo thrived at Montgomery , taking the school to the junior college national championship game . This earned him a scholarship to Maryland , where he set school records for passing and touchdowns his senior year , leading the ACC in total offense . <p> And none of it mattered . The NFL did n't care . Scouts came to work out Kaleo , then looked at his size , saw he could n't throw deep and shrugged disinterestedly . He should go to the Canadian Football League , they said . But when he did , he was cut a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Hohensee , by then coaching the Albany franchise in the AFL , and asked if he could work out with the team for a few weeks to stay in shape . Then the starting quarterback got hurt and , right after that , his backup went down and Kaleo was thrust into the starting role and has been in the league ever since . <p> " It 's ironic , you know , " Hohensee said . " We go through life and we 're all looking for that niche , something you can call your own and be good at and he found that here . " <p> Kaleo figures he ca n't go on much longer and has a plan to play only two more years . He wo n't say this . Rather it is his wife , Jamie , who reveals this bit of information . <p> Yet strangely , even though she is left behind in Tampa with their sons Parker and Carson , ages 7 and 6 , she is not the one pushing the accelerated timetable . She loves watching her husband play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's his dream since he was eight years old and now that he 's getting paid to do it , why stop ? " she said . " You really are recognized when we are in these towns where he plays . I 'm just floored by it . I 'm still shocked that someone will wait so long for his autograph . " <p> They met in 1997 when he played in Anaheim , Calif . One of her friends introduced them and , three months later , they were married . <p> " We just knew , " Jamie said . <p> She never had time to absorb what it meant to be married to a professional football player . The next thing she knew , he was off to Hartford , Conn. , where he again would only stay a season . In 2000 , when he signed a four-year contract with Tampa Bay , she agreed to move to Florida full time . A couple of years later , her parents moved , too . <p> Kaleo figures he has several job options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Service agent , even going so far as to make contacts and study for the tests . But then football took off and the Secret Service was forgotten . <p> In Anaheim , after he tore his ACL in 1997 and missed the 1998 season , he joined up with a friend who was a sports agent in the Los Angeles area . The friend handled baseball players and Kaleo tried to build a football client list . He had a handful of players , none of whom made a mark in pro football . <p> He seemed to enjoy being an agent . Jamie thought he was very good at it and marveled at how he landed meetings with several top draft prospects . Ultimately , the tiny agency had no money and Kaleo had no way to promise the up-front money that the big agents can give first-rounders . Without any big names , the business dissolved . <p> A few years ago , Kaleo was introduced to real estate by a friend who had become a successful home seller . He joined the friend 's firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy to keep up when he was playing in town , but once he left in 2004 to play for a season in Austin , real estate became a part-time job . <p> Right now he 's in the process of deciding whether this is his future or whether he wants to pursue something else . <p> " John will be successful at what he does , let me put it that way , " Jamie said . " He puts 110 percent into everything he does . " <p> He has set up interviews in June to discuss business opportunities that might not come about for another two years . <p> " He will not let his family take a step down , " Jamie said . <p> Still , as he sat in a meeting room next to the indoor soccer field where the Columbus Destroyers practice , the end looked like a distant horizon . Kaleo leaned back in a chair , wearing a Destroyers cap and a Destroyers golf shirt , and smiled as his teammates filed past on their way to lunch . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " I think it 's the ' want to , ' you know ? The want to keep playing , to feel you can contribute at a high level . It 's like I 'm scared there 's nothing else out there to do because there 's a part of me that says , ' When that time comes I 'm ready for it to come , I 'm ready to take on a new adventure . ' <p> " But I do n't think I 'm done with this adventure . It 's still exciting to me. "
