Mr. Williamson 's latest story has a bit in common with " Afterlife " ( from our February issue ) , but that 's mostly because both stories are set in the same universe and both consider questions of mortality . Here the tale 's focus is less on spirituality and more on action , but the results are no less thought-provoking . <p> THE PLANET WAS A LEGEND of the starways . As old spacemen told the story , it was the perfect world , totally terraformed , free of polar ice and tropic heat , densely forested , and richly productive . Its people were never ill , never aged , never died . None of the tellers had been there , however , nor known anyone who had . When asked why it was missing from the charts , they said no traders ever called . It was far out toward the galactic rim , located at the edge of a great star cluster . Endowed with everything , its happy citizens made nothing to sell and had no need to buy . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word of truth in it , until an aging space-breaker pilot named LeZarr came to the office and sat till I had time to see him . He gave me a package wrapped in bright gold foil . An old paper book when I opened it , gone brittle and yellow with age . " The secret of life ! " He was a hard-nosed veteran of the skyways by his looks , his mouth stained purple-red by the starkiss nuts he chewed . They gave him a faint bitter scent , and I saw a glint of madness in his eyes . " Read it , " he said . " Show it to Mr. McDervik . A chance I think he 'll take . " I 'd seen so many scams I should have thrown him out , but he held me fixed with that crazy stare till I skimmed through the book . It was the life story of an All Souls missionary who claimed his church had sent him to the Planet of Youth to carry his own message of the life eternal . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a Sol-type sun . I found the people godless . They claim they live forever and swear they never sin . I preached to them , prayed with them , tried to warn them of the dire peril to their immortal souls . They laughed at salvation . " I was about to laugh at him , till he opened the book and showed me a note on the flyleaf , written in faded red ink . " Read this . " He pointed with a stubby finger . " Galactic coordinates that locate a star known to have planets . It 's off the trade routes , but I 've plotted a five-skip route to take us there . Tell Mr. McDervik it 's a business opportunity . " I hesitated . An interstellar tycoon , head of McDervik Pan-Galactic , he had no time for cranks . " Tell him Fawn sent it . " He paused for a wistful smile . " A girl you 'd love . She claims to be his granddaughter , but I do n't know . She works as a nurse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She would n't be , I thought . " Vultures ! " I 'd heard him call his heirs . " All of you vultures ! Swarming overhead and perched all around , hungry for the flesh on my bones . " He was my great-uncle and I knew his ways . He paid me peanuts , called me a stupid jerk , and worked me like a slave . " You 'll get it when I die , " he used to say when I hinted for a raise . " I 'm leaving you the planet Grand Bonanza . It 's just opened for settlement and rich in everything . As proprietor , you can tax it for trillions . " Nobody loved him , but that promise had always tempted me to endure his ugly ways and hang on as his general factotum and favorite punching bag . " Please sir , " LeZarr begged me now . " If you knew my wife- " Pain twisted his purple lips . " A martyr and a saint ! She stayed here on Earth and raised three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galaxy . Now I 'm okay and she 's sick and dying of a rare mutation the medics ca n't reverse . If that planet has something that could save her- " He looked so woeful that I took him up to McDervik 's top-floor office . Physically , McDervik was zero . Twisted and totally hairless from a nameless malady his space-going father had picked up out toward the rim , he wore a sleek black wig . His back was bent with age , his left arm shriveled . He hobbled about on a silver cane . Yet he owned half a thousand planets . He 'd hunted for sport as long as he was able . His huge desk , at the center of a high spire room in the Pan-Galactic tower , was surrounded with his off-Earth trophies , monsters apt to startle unwarned visitors . Wide windows all around the room looked down upon the city roofs . At McDervik Starport , out in the distance , a sleek silver space-breaker was just lifting to skip a hundred light-years in no time at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unlucky flunky . He left us standing until the quivering victim had scuttled off to the elevator , then turned at last to stab LeZarr with a dagger stare . " Who the hell are you ? " " Space-breaker pilot Jean LeZarr , sir . License Number Q7B , Polaris Sector Nine . Rating First Class , Range Unlimited . " He laid his license and the missionary 's book on the desk . " Sir , here is a gift from your granddaughter Fawn- " " What the hell does she want ? " " Nothing , sir . But a note on the flyleaf tells the way to the fabulous Planet of Youth . " " A fabulous con ! " McDervik gave him a yellow-fanged snarl . " Invented to milk the fools who believe it . " " Look at the book . " LeZarr held his ground . " It contains plausible evidence that it actually exists . " " Why the devil should you care ? " " I care for her . " He laid a holo card on the desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air above it , feebly smiling . She might have been beautiful once , but her pale features looked wasted , her blonde hair thin and dull . " She 's dying , sir , unless something off that planet can save her . " " What 's that to me ? " " Sir , you 'll forgive me- " LeZarr took a moment to scan McDervik 's damaged body . " Suppose the planet 's real ? Suppose we could all be young again ? Just think about it . " I saw a flash of anger , but McDervik caught himself to squint at the holo image , scrutinize the license again , riffle through the book . He finally scowled at the ancient date and tossed the book back at LeZarr with a grimace from some chronic ache . " I think it 's a trap for greedy idiots . " LeZarr caught the book and held it to his heart . " Only five skips , sir . Be there in a day . Back in another if it 's just a mirage . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a nose for luck . " What 's to lose ? " He squinted at the book . " You lead the way . I 'll pay your charter fees . Leave your flight plan with my pilot . Signal him if you find the planet , which ai n't likely . Wait in orbit if you do , till I can join you for the landing . " He paid the charter fees and we waited for the signal . " Planet reached , " it ran . " Fits description . Waiting in polar orbit for your arrival . " We followed in his star yacht and found LeZarr safe in orbit . He docked with us and came aboard . McDervik greeted him with a doubtful scowl . " So what have we got ? " " A perfect planet ! " LeZarr gestured at the planet , a great blue globe , splashed with green continents and bright cloud spirals , spinning lazily beneath us . " But people ? " He frowned and shook his head . " No cities I can see . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called to identify myself . Asked for a landing permit . Got no reply . " " Permit or not , I 'm going down . " We launched a lander and glided down . Skimming the forests on the continent , we saw no marks of civilization . LeZarr set us down on a wide meadow between a ridge of sandstone cliffs and a tall wall of trees . He unsealed the lock and cycled out to test the air . " As fresh as a Terran spring , " he reported . " I heard a trilling like a lark in the sky . " McDervik limped off the lander armed for battle , a wrinkled warrior gnome in a camouflage-dyed safari suit , weighed down with a leather ammunition harness , a long-barreled projectile launcher hung at one hip and a wicked-looking knife sheathed at the other . A holocam was slung around his skinny neck . We found no foes . Animals I took for Terran zebras were grazing peacefully across the meadow , but the enormous bird standing in a waterhole was nothing imported from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a graceful body that caught the morning sun like burnished silver . Long  --  legged and long-necked , it was feeding , stabbing at something in the water with a needle-keen beak . It ignored us at first , but took flight when McDervik unslung the holocam , spreading great wings in an explosion of crimson and gold and flapping off across the treetops . LeZarr caught my arm , pointing to a monster striding out of the forest . Lizard-like and long-tailed , it came stalking on two massive legs . Its towering body was armored with wide green plates , its great-jawed head topped with a saw-toothed crimson crest . McDervik snatched for his gun . " Sir , do n't shoot ! " LeZarr warned him sharply . " Not unless you have to . " The monster stalked past us and on through the little herd of grazing zebras . Some of them moved to give it room , but they showed no alarm . A flight of tiny , bright blue birds came to whirl around us , singing like canaries , and followed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LeZarr whispered . " Like the missionary said . I 've seen a hundred worlds , and still I ca n't believe it ! " " If it 's Eden , show me the angels . " McDervik scowled at the empty meadow and stopped to point with a shriveled arm . " What 's that ? " I caught a silver flash , where the sun struck a dome of something like polished silver , almost lost in a grove of blue-blooming trees . " A dwelling ? " LeZarr shaded his eyes . " And people ! " A woman in something red came walking toward us from beyond the waterhole . McDervik raised his binoculars to watch a dozen others following out of the forest . They were gaily clad in rainbow-colored saris , their arms and heads uncovered . Some of them carried baskets . " They look young enough . " He lowered the glasses , frowning . " But where are any children ? " " They would n't have children , " LeZarr said . " Not if they 're actually immortal . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " McDervik muttered . " We 're here on business . " We had moved to meet them , but they trooped on beyond us to crowd like children around the lander , pointing at the skip engines , fingering the bright silver trim . I caught scraps of carefree talk , the accents oddly soft but our own English . LeZarr sighed . " I wish my wife could be that happy . " THE WOMAN IN RED came back to us . Well revealed by the tight sari , she was vigorous and attractive , with long , ginger-colored hair that fell free behind her back . " You come from the stars ? " She frowned sharply at McDervik and his weapons . " We want no conflict here . " " Neither do we . " He had a wolfish charm when he chose to use it . He turned it on her now , and got a childish smile . " We are only students touring the galaxy . We came here in search of the famous Planet of Youth . Have we found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled frown . " We are not young . " " You look young . And very lovely . " He waited for her to smile again . " If I may ask - " His yellow eyes narrowed shrewdly . " Are you immortal ? " " Immor- " The word seemed to baffle her . " What is that ? " " Do people die ? " " Die ? " She was still bewildered . McDervik shook his head and turned to LeZarr for help . " They stop breathing , " LeZarr said . " Stop moving . Fall down . Decay . " " Animals do , sometimes . " She nodded . " Unless doc Scott is there to fix them . " " Ho ! " McDervik nudged LeZarr in the ribs . " I think we 're in business . " Eagerly , he turned back to her . " Can you tell what he does for animals ? " " How would I know ? " Vaguely , she shrugged . " I 'm not a doctor . " " We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tomorrow , perhaps . " McDervik scowled . " Why not right now ? " " We 're on our way to the songfest . " " May we come with you ? " Uncertainly , she turned to look at her companions . He warmed his voice and used his charm . " Please ! " That captured her . Her name was Aranda . She called her friends away from the ship and told them we were guests from the stars . They smiled politely and shook our hands in the way of Earth , but seemed to care nothing for the stars . LeZarr refused to leave the lander unguarded , but McDervik and I went on with Aranda , following a footpath toward the cliffs . We found a gathering crowd below a sort of natural stage outside a shallow cave eroded into a wall of red sandstone . Groups were spreading mats on the grass , opening baskets filled with food and bottled wine . They were vegetarians , the dishes strange to us . There were huge crimson mushrooms with almost the flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of freshly buttered toast , tart green fruits , bowls of honey-sweet purple berries . McDervik unslung the holocam and thrust it at me . " Get it all . A vision of paradise ! I want it for promotion and sales . " He had me shoot a panorama of our ship and the waterhole and the forest around us , then the singers on their natural stage . He wanted closeups of the food baskets and Aranda in her red sari . He posed with his stringy arm around her . " Evidence ! " He was exultant . " Evidence to convince the universe . " He was ignoring the songs . I caught few of the words , but I began to hear emotion in the voices , tension and triumph , finally a sense of calm contentment . Aranda opened a bottle of wine . His doctors on Earth had forbidden alcohol , and at first he refused it . " It ca n't hurt you , " she urged him . " Not if Doc Scott can fix you the way he does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the songs . He drank a glass , asked for another , and finally went to sleep lying beside her on the grass . The afternoon sun had sunk low before the songfest ended and people began gathering their baskets and rolling the mats . McDervik roused himself to ask when we could see the doctor . " Tomorrow morning , " Aranda promised . " I 'll come to take you . " We slept on the lander , and woke to a songbird serenade . A warm sun was climbing into a clear blue sky , the fresh air fragrant from the many  --  colored blooms that spangled the meadow . LeZarr took a deep breath when we came outside , and borrowed the holocam to shoot a little herd of African impala drinking at the waterhole . " It looks too perfect ! " He shook his head . " Too perfect to be true . " Aranda was late . McDervik fumed all morning , hobbling around the lander and watching for her . The sun was almost overhead before she arrived in a sleek golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close embrace , kissed both his wrinkled cheeks , and asked if he was ready to see the doctor . LeZarr stayed again to guard the lander . She led us into the forest , along a gravel footpath neatly curbed with colored stones . The trees were spaced well apart , bright with flowering vines that draped the lower branches . When we saw a dozen antelope grazing across a sun-dappled glade , Aranda stopped to call out as if she knew them by name . They raised graceful heads to look for a moment , and grazed again . The doctor 's house stood in an open clearing , a small stone building roofed with red tile . A faded sign above the door read CARTER SCOTT , M. D. We found him spading a vegetable garden behind it . Lean , dark-haired , and tall , he wore a T-shirt and faded jeans . He greeted Aranda with a kiss and turned to smile at us . " Guests from outside . " She gave him our names . " They seem worn and broken , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDervik 's bent and shrunken frame . " Can you repair them ? " " A nanorob transfer ? It should be possible . " He beckoned us toward wicker chairs on a veranda that looked out across the clearing to a solitary tree , dead but aflame with flowering vines . " We seldom see outsiders . Tell me about yourselves . " " Dirk McDervik . I own McDervik Pan-Galactic . " Expansively , he gestured at the sky . " You may have heard of it . " The doctor looked blank . McDervik shrugged and asked about nanorob transfers . " The nanorobs are microscopic robots , " he said . " Expert physicians , really , that replicate themselves and circulate through the body . They function to heal or replace damaged cells . The technology was developed back on Earth a thousand years ago , but outlawed by a backward government . " " Outlawed ? What went wrong ? " " The rulers . " Scott sighed and sat for a moment staring off into the cloudless sky . " They tried to exterminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill . We were finally allowed to charter ships and migrate to this planet , remote from everywhere . There was only one condition , that we never leave . " He shrugged and grinned at McDervik . " So here we 'll be forever . " " You are a doctor ? " " Trained back on Earth , before the nanorobs . Internist and cardiac surgeon . I was good at it . " I thought he looked wistful . " There 's no need for surgery here . I do bandage up a few accidental flesh wounds until the nanorobs can close them , or set an occasional broken bone . Most of my patients are the native creatures or the few terrestrial animals we brought with us . I let the nanorobs do the actual healing . " McDervik leaned eagerly forward . " Can they heal me ? " " If you like . They do n't fail . " " Then I 'm your patient . just name your fee . " " We 've no use for money here . " He waved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to play back on Earth . Here I 've found a more rewarding sport . Higher math . That 's a world of infinite complexities that can challenge you forever , with no loss or pain to anybody else . " He led us into his house , through a long , sparsely furnished room with a fireplace at one end and bookshelves at the other , the walls painted with mural landscapes of ancient Earth . We came into a smaller room that was evidently both kitchen and office . Pots and pans hung around a big ceramic stove at one end . Shelves of bottles , glassware , and bright metal instruments surrounded a high table at the other . McDervik stopped to squint at them doubtfully . " Low-tech . " Scott shrugged a vague apology . " Creating the nanorobs took the best technology we had , but here we can be content with simpler things . " He washed his hands at the kitchen sink and came back to light a little lamp and sterilize a needle . Aranda and McDervik sat on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew a drop of her blood on a glass slide , and pressed it against a scratch on his , and said that was all . " All ? " McDervik was incredulous . " The nanorobs will multiply , " Scott said . " Come back if you have questions . " McDervik was jubilant when we got back to the lander . " The secret of eternity ! " he greeted LeZarr . " I 'll own the universe ! As soon as my attorneys can lock up the patent rights ! Men will stand in line to mortgage their souls for immortality . " Feeling high through the afternoon , he made a big meal from a basket that Aranda had left for us . He drank most of a bottle of wine , expanding great schemes to franchise the nanorobs on every settled planet . Generously , he offered to make LeZarr a franchisee , with free immortality for his wife . We went to sleep on the lander . He woke me about midnight , hunched over the controls and screaming at LeZarr . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were wide and wild . " That scheming quack ! He 's poisoned me ! Coming now to steal the ship ! " " Sir , please ! " LeZarr tried to calm him . " The lock 's sealed . We 're safe inside . I 'm afraid you 're out of your head . " McDervik swung back to the controls . LeZarr tried to pull him away . He struck back and sent LeZarr staggering . I tried to help . He fought us off with a strength that seemed superhuman , till suddenly he crumpled to the deck and lay there gasping , his eyes rolling back in his head . We lifted him into a berth . Hot with fever , he lay there the rest of the night , sometimes limply lifeless , sometimes tossing , striking blindly out at nothing , moaning , screaming that he was dying . " Stop - stop the bugs ! " He sat up once , yelling hoarsely . " They 're in my blood ! Burning - burning my skin ! Crawling in my veins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , begged for water and seemed to sleep , hoarsely snoring . Once again he woke in a better mood , laughing at nothing , shouting in a strange voice , trying to sing a song we had heard . He sank at last into a coma so deep we could n't rouse him , still hot and drenched with sweat . Aranda came at dawn . She felt his forehead and promised to send for Dr. Scott . Some of her friends brought food he could n't eat , and carried him off the lander to a cot under a little tent , where they hoped the fresh air would help him . Scott came that afternoon , put a stethoscope to his heart , and told us not to worry . " A strong reaction to the nanorobs , " he said . " A lot of physical abuse and decay to be repaired , but they 're taking hold . His future health should be perfect . Call me if you need me . " WE WERE THERE another week . Aranda came every day to bathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his hand when he moaned in distress . On the third day he woke from his coma . Weak at first , he soon had a ravenous appetite for the fruits and mushroom she brought us , though he wanted nothing from the ship 's supplies . His blighted arm was suddenly strong again , his wrinkles smoothed into a youthful smile . He walked without his cane to watch the zebras coming to the waterhole . Aranda brought food and wine to celebrate his recovery , and we sat around folding tables set up beside the ship . Dr. Scott took his pulse and called him fit as a kid . " And free to go if the nanorobs will let you . " " Why should we go ? " Grinning with elation , he glanced at me . " We 've found all we ever longed for . The perfect life on the perfect planet ! We 're immortal as the gods we used to imagine , free of pain , immune to trouble . Why throw it all away ? " " There 's Pan-Galactic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pan-Galactic ? " He squinted off into the empty sky . " Why bother ? " He grinned at Aranda and turned to me . " Tell LeZarr he can go . Unless he wants to stay here with us . " I found LeZarr on the ship , checking his star charts . " The hell with " em ! " he exploded . " I 'm getting back to my wife , but not to murder her with bugs in her brain . You want to know why these zombies never die ? They 're already dead . Meat machines , run by those little devils swarming in their blood . No wonder they were shipped way out here . " He offered me a starkiss nut . " My own poison of choice . Let McDervik pick his own . But tell him I ca n't take off without a signed release from his charter contract . Proof for the authorities that I did n't abandon him to die on some airless rock . " McDervik was in no hurry to sign anything . Aranda had opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you want , " Scott told him . " No headaches here . " McDervik sat beside Aranda and let her feed him tidbits . We sat there till dusk with the feast and wine , learning her folksongs . The planet is deep in the star cluster , and the night sky was suddenly ablaze with more stars and brighter stars than I had ever seen . When I marveled at them , Aranda left McDervik with another bottle of wine and caught my hand . " Come along , " she whispered . " I 've something else to show you . " Down at the waterhole , we found its surface brighter than the sky , shimmering with reflections of the luminous night flowers in bloom all around it . Their heavy fragrance was more intoxicating than the wine . A night bird was singing somewhere , and she was lovely in the magical starlight . She sighed and drew me closer . I slid my arm around her waist . She let her body melt against me and gave me a kiss I wo n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ear . " Please ! You 're somebody new and you 'll love it here ! " Her own sweet odor is the last thing I remember . LeZarr got me back on the ship . He woke me next morning , and stuck a pen and paper in my face . " The charter contract . " He was crunching a starkiss nut , and my stomach roiled from its burnt-toast scent . " Sign the release if you want to stay here . " My head was splitting , and my vision blurred the pen , but I felt glad to have no nanorobs in my blood . I pushed the contract away . An hour later , we were taking off . Looking back , I saw McDervik and Aranda standing by the waterhole , holding hands as they waved farewell . The planet shrank behind us till LeZarr cut the jets and I saw the coupled ships shining in the sun . We left McDervik 's yacht still safe in polar orbit , its robot crew left there to wait for him forever . We skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth was greeted with disbelief that turned to consternation . McDervik had never named a successor to head Pan-Galactic . His heirs sued the company , demanding an immediate reading of his will . He had left no will . The company attorneys produced his signature on the charter contract as proof that he was still alive . They set up a trust to administer his affairs , and the trustees seem likely to control the company forever . They have let me go , with a platinum-cased multiplanet timepiece and a certificate of recognition for faithful service to McDervik PanGalactic . I 'll never inherit the planet he promised me , but LeZarr introduced me to Fawn , McDervik 's granddaughter , who is lovelier than Aranda and totally alive . She 's no heiress now , but seems not to care . We are migrating from Earth to find a new home on Grand Bonanza . <p>
