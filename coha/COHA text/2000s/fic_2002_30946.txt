Chapter Three She 'd been his wife for nearly three days , but Van der Vries had n't touched her . " I will not claim my marital rights until after you 're rid of your ... embarrassment , " he told her . " I 'm sure you will appreciate my consideration and act accordingly . " Sally was n't sure what acting accordingly meant until he showed her the room at the front of the house . " Prepared especially for you , my dear . If there 's anything you need that you do not have , tell me . " Crocks , vials , jugs , jars  --  a few even of rare and precious glass  --  dosing spoons and scales , a brazier for heating small quantities and a fireplace for large ones ... there was nothing lacking in the manner of equipment . " I have need of plants to simple with . " Sally had made no attempt to keep the scorn from her voice . " Perhaps you have forgotten that , mijnheer . " " No , mevrouw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave came in carrying a bushel basket filled to the brim with the seed capsules of poppies . " I wish you to make as much laudanum as you can , but be sure and save enough seed for further planting . I 'm thinking of buying a field at the end of the road for the purpose . If that is not possible , we will uproot the orchard . " Laudanum . That 's what this was all about . Her skill in making it and Jacob Van der Vries 's lust for the strange and compelling dreams it induced . As long ago as Roman times herbalists such as Pliny had written of the dangers of sipping the juice of the poppy . Sweet pleasure that leaves pain and destruction behind ... Laudanum had set them on this road to hell , but Sally saw no choice except to follow it . At least until the child was born . Sally knew Van der Vries 's mind as she 'd known Lucas 's . Her husband , God help her , intended to kill the baby the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would defeat them both . Her child would live . The answer lay in the practice of her craft . The room at the front of the house on Pearl Street would be her refuge . * Lucas tried three times to see her . He picked his moments , watching until he saw Van der Vries leave the house , but twice his knock went unanswered . He was sure Sally was inside and that she knew it was him , but short of breaking in there was nothing he could do . The third time , Hetje came to the door . " Hetje , thank God . I wish to speak with my sister . Tell her I 'm here . " The slave shook her head . " Mevrouw tell me no , barber . Mevrouw say you ca n't come in . " " She 's got to see me , Hetje . I have to explain . " " Mevrouw told me to tell you she 's the physician 's wife now . Does n't matter to her what a barber thinks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop dead this very minute and it means nothing to her . " " Indeed . Well , you can tell her the message is clear . How is she , Hetje ? " " Mevrouw be a little tired , barber . She got the ague . " " So that 's the story Van der Vries is putting about , is it ? She has the ague . " " Mevrouw be well soon . See everybody then . " Hetje spoke the words as if by rote . Lucas leaned toward the black girl . " Hetje , you and I , I believe we understand each other . We both know that sometimes you have to do things you hate . Tell my sister for me this was one of those times . Say I 'm sorry . That I 'll do anything I can to make amends . Swear you 'll tell her . " Hetje nodded . " I be  --  " " Hetje ! Shut the door and come inside . " Sally 's voice . She was probably sitting on the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave , but she was ready for him , stiffened against his assault . " Mevrouw say you ca n't come in , barber . She say I 'm not to let you in . " Although Hetje was strong , Lucas could easily have overpowered her . But he saw no point . Not until Sally 's attitude softened . After she was rid of the savage 's child . " You 're sure she 's all right ? That sod 's not abusing her in any way ? If he ever does , Hetje , you must tell me immed  --  " " Mevrouw a little tired from the ague . " Hetje was staring past him , looking at some point in the air over his left shoulder . Lucas turned to go . He was halfway down the path when he turned back . The black girl was still standing in the door , but this time she was looking directly at him . " Hetje , the poppies that grew on my land , near my cabin ... After the petals dropped , the seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was a few days after my sister married your master . You would n't know anything about that , would you ? " " Mevrouw be a little tired from the ague . " " Very well , " Lucas said softly . " Tell her what I said . Tell her I 'm sorry . " He walked down the long path between the apple trees and let himself out Van der Vries 's front gate and onto Pearl Street . * Hetje watched until the gate closed behind the barber , then turned to look for her mistress . Mevrouw Turner was no longer in the hall . The slave went to the simpling room . " The barber be gone , mevrouw . He told me to tell you he  --  " " I know what he told you . I heard every word . And believed not one of them . Pass me that ladle . " The laudanum was almost ready . The poppy seeds had been steeping fifteen days with ripe apples and dried currants . The brew was semi-liquid and covered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crock and lifted a bit of the mixture to her nose . The smell was perfect , rich and heady , with the distinct odor of yeast . " It 's ready for straining . You 'll have to help me with this part . Carry the crock over there to that table . Hetje , where do you buy the doctor 's meat ? " " At the shambles market on the Brede Wegh , mevrouw . I be going early in the morning . Get the very best . You want me to pour this stuff into that cloth ? " " Into the straining muslin , yes . Carefully , so you disturb the sediment as little as possible . From now on you are to buy meat in the afternoon . From the butcher on Hall Place , Hetje . And tell me everything you observe when you 're there . " * Sally had never before made such a quantity of laudanum at one time . When she finished decanting it she had four crockery jugs of the pale gold liquid . And one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hidden beneath a loose board in the floor of the simpling room . She was careful to put it there when she was sure none could see her , not even Hetje . From the first day she 'd arrived at this place as Jacob Van der Vries 's lawful wife , she 'd known that the young slave was prepared to be her ally . But if there was one thing the last few months had taught her , it was to trust no one . Not the Indians she 'd thought were her friends . Not the minister who said he served Almighty God . Not the brother who had protected her all her life , until he sold her for sixty guilders . But you , my darling child , can trust me . I will not fail you . Jacob Van der Vries had no reason to look for a hidden supply of laudanum . He looked instead at the jugs lined up on the counter in the simpling room he 'd prepared for his new wife and trembled with delight . " Excellent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to your standards ? " " I 've made none better . " " Excellent , " Van der Vries repeated softly . " Perhaps after the midday meal I will sample a bit . Just to be sure it is fit for my patients . " They ate early , at Van der Vries 's insistence ; it was just past two when Sally took her place opposite him at the table . The meal was silent . Sally had initiated no conversation with Jacob Van der Vries since the moment the minister pronounced them man and wife . When he spoke , she answered ; otherwise she kept her lips clamped shut . Mostly , he was silent , too , except to inquire after the laudanum . Now that it was made neither had anything to say to the other . Hetje brought the food and set the dishes in front of them . They ate . Sally took only as much as she needed to keep the baby healthy and strong , and gagged even on that . She had to force each mouthful past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart and her throat . Normally Van der Vries was a hearty eater . Today he had a few mouthfuls of venison and pumpkin and beans , then jumped to his feet . " I have eaten more than enough . I believe it is a good moment to test your laudanum , wife . Bring me some . " " A spoonful ? " She made herself sound chastened and compliant . " In some hot water perhaps ? " " Two spoonfuls . " Van der Vries smiled . " And I require no water . A fair test . " She went to the simpling room and came back with a small tin cup containing the viscous yellow liquid . He grabbed it from her and gulped it down . Ten minutes later he was sitting in his study , puffing dreamily on his pipe , staring into the empty fireplace and smiling a vacant , happy smile . Sally stood in the door and watched him for a bit , keeping her hands clasped over her belly all the while . Finally she turned away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by the fireplace and the bake oven built into the wall beside it . Hetje was there , cleaning up after the meal . Sally sat down on the stool beside the table in the middle of the room . " The venison you served for dinner was excellent , Hetje . Did you get it at the butcher shop in Hall Place as I told you to ? " " Yes , mevrouw . I always be doing everything you and the master tell me to . " " I think not , " Sally said softly . " Only when it suits you . " " Hetje be a good slave . " The girl set to wiping the table with long sweeps of her strong arms . " Mijnheer and mevrouw never have no cause to beat Hetje . " " I will never beat you , " Sally said quietly . " You have my sworn oath on it . And I will do everything I can to see that "  --  she could not bring herself to say " my husband "  --  " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hetje , will you help me ? " " Hetje be a good slave . Hetje do everything mevrouw tells  --  " " Enough , Hetje . I am in this place because I have no choice . Exactly as you are . And I am going to have a child . " Hetje stopped cleaning the table . She carried the crumbs to the wooden barrel in the corner and disposed of them . Finally she turned around . " What you be wanting me to do , mevrouw ? " " Tell me what you discovered at the butcher shop . " " There be a lot of talk in that place , mevrouw . " " What kind of talk ? Is my brother  --  " " I hear nothing about the barber . It be the butcher they talk about . He went away last month and no one seen him since . His poor wife be doing everything by herself . And her eyes be all red from weeping . " " Weeping ? Marit Graumann ? Over Ankel Jannssen ? I do n't believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her abominably . " " I do n't know nothing about that , mevrouw . But her eyes be half closed with crying . That 's plain enough . And she look ill . " " And no one truly knows where her husband has gone ? " " That 's what I be hearing in the town , mevrouw . No one knows . Two of the burgomasters and the sheriff search the whole house up and down and find nothing . They say the butcher 's clothes be gone as well . And that he be saying for years he be going to sail away on a rum ship . Going to the islands , maybe . " " And my brother , the barber ? What do they say of him ? " " Nothing , mevrouw . I do n't be hearing nothing about the barber . " Sally drew invisible lines on the table with one finger . She did n't look at the other woman . " Shall I tell you something , Hetje ? A secret ? I think I shall . My brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have been lovers for well over a year . I thought it for a time , but I was n't sure . Then one day , before the siege , I followed Lucas to a secret place in the woods up near the Collect Pond , Hetje . I saw the things they did to each other , my brother and the butcher 's wife . You would not believe them . " Sally stopped speaking . Hetje was staring at Sally with her great black eyes and it was as if she could see into her soul . " You be poisoning your heart with what you watched , " she whispered . " You watch another couple loving and it poisons  --  " A loud and insistent pounding cut off Hetje 's words . The two women rushed to the hall . " It must be him , " Sally said breathlessly . " The laudanum 's made him mad . " " Not the master , " Hetje said . " Somebody be beating on the front door . " " Dear God , maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer it , Hetje . Tell whoever it is the physician is not here . Say he wo n't return until this evening . " Sally stepped back into the shadows near the kitchen . " Very well , now , Hetje . Open the door . " A man stood on the stoop , back lit by the late afternoon sun . Sally had to squint to see him , but she could hear him plain enough . " English warships ! " he shouted . " Four of them . Just sailed into the harbor . Tell your master . And stay inside with your doors well bolted . " * Colonel Richard Nicolls demanded the town in the name of Charles II , King of England . Stuyvesant presented him with a letter reviewing the Dutch claim to the territory . Nicolls refused to read it . " You may write what you wish , sir . If the town is not surrendered in two days ' time it will be shelled . " The fort was crumbling . After the latest Indian war , there were fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a reasonable amount of ammunition for the soldiers ' muskets , but almost none for the town 's cannon . The English terms were generous . The residents of the town could retain their property and worship as they chose . The governor hesitated , tormented by his fierce loyalty to the Dutch West India Company . The colonists had no such scruples . They demanded capitulation . There were well over two thousand people in Nieuw Netherland . Not even Peter Stuyvesant could stand against the will of so many . He signed the terms of surrender on the eighth day of September , 1664 , then retired to his extensive bouwerie beyond the Voorstadt , north of the wall . Nearly everyone else stayed where they were and went on with their lives , the only differences being that now they were ruled by the brother of the English king , James , Duke of York ; Fort Orange had become Albany ; and Nieuw Amsterdam was New York . And being English was suddenly an advantage . Of sorts . Under some circumstances . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you , barber ? " " Three and a half years here in the colony . Since June of 1661 . Before that I was in Rotterdam . " " I see . Get on with them , do you ? Speak the language ? " " Well enough . " The Englishman turned a few more of the papers on his desk . The two men were in the former Stadt Huys . It was now called the City Hall , but the window at the far end of the room still looked out toward Hall Place . Not close enough for Lucas to see anything , but he kept gazing over the other man 's shoulder nonetheless , in the direction of Marit 's shop . " They tell me you 're a surgeon as well as a barber . " Witherspoon , the man asking the questions , wore the latest fashion  --  a powdered wig and a pale blue satin waistcoat and dark blue velvet breeches . Called himself secretary to Nicolls , who was now the governor of New York . " I hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well , adept at setting broken bones and cutting away tumors . " " I am well trained in my craft , Mr. Witherspoon . And you seem to know a good deal about us for a man who 's been here less than a week . " " The value of taking a census , Mr. Turner . One hears so much . " " Yes , I suppose that 's so . Now , if that is all , I 'll  --  " " Of course , must n't keep you . Just one last thing . Did you learn your trade in Rotterdam ? Among the Dutch ? " " No , sir . In London . With the English Barbers ' Company . " There was no doubt in Lucas 's mind that Witherspoon already knew as much . The Company published lists of its members every year , had been doing so for nearly a century . Men who became secretaries to colonial governors were the sort who made themselves familiar with such lists . Witherspoon smiled . " Rare in these modern times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a surgeon ? I mean , if one is apprenticed to the English Company ? " " Extremely rare . " " Then New York is indeed fortunate , " Witherspoon said softly . " One barber who is also a surgeon , and a physician as well . Who , as luck would have it , is married to the barber 's sister . That 's correct , is n't it ? " " It is . " " And you , sir  --  as yet , you are unmarried ? " " As yet . " " I see . " Witherspoon put down his pen . " Very well , you may leave . " Lucas turned to go . " There 's just one other thing , Mr. Turner . Since you 're an Englishman by blood and birth ... In some ways Governor Nicolls finds this a strange place . One would expect the Dutch church to hold sway , but it appears there are , as well , Sabbatarians , Antisabbatarians , Singing Quakers , Ranting Quakers , Jews ... It boggles a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Papists . " " I believe that 's true . " " But Stuyvesant ... The word is that he 's as stubborn a believer in his own religion as any you 'll meet . Do you not , barber , find that a strange combination of circumstances ? " Lucas took a few steps toward the other man 's desk and pointed at the window . " Out there you have a town founded with one intent : the earning of money . If whatever God you pray to assists you in that aim "  --  Lucas shrugged  --  " then the Dutch West India Company made you welcome . Believe what you like , and keep quiet about it . More important , get on with business . " " And you find that acceptable ? " " I find it less unacceptable than some other creeds . There are none starving in this place . And in general , the peace is kept . " Witherspoon smiled . " A fair measure . The general peace . You are intelligent , barber . And as I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you will not mistake my meaning when I ask you to keep your eyes open . And to have a quiet word with me if any here in New York seem to be particularly unhappy about His Grace 's rule . " " What I have been trying to explain , sir , is that the people of New Ams  --  New York are not much interested in who rules back in Europe . They will be content if you can keep the savages in their place , do not tax them unduly , and let them get on with their lives . " " Which , according to you , involve largely the creation of wealth . " " Yes . " " Fair enough . But if you should note anything else  --  anything you judge untoward  --  you will find Governor Nicolls to be most accommodating to his friends , Mr. Turner . " Lucas calculated rapidly . Seize the opportunity when it presents itself ; the concept had served him well before . " There is one man you might wish to keep an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back he was suggesting the Dutch colonists declare war on the English . " " Thank you . We shall be wary of Mr. Doncke . " Fair enough . It was something to keep them occupied until they found out Doncke was a doddering old fool and no one paid him any mind . " One other thing as well , Mr. Witherspoon . A question about English legal practice . " The man behind the desk nodded , waiting . " If a man deserts his wife , " Lucas said softly , " disappears with no warning , and no provision made for her well-being , how long must it be before the woman is declared a widow and free to marry again ? The Dutch say seven years . Is English law the same ? " Witherspoon made a tent of his fingers and peered at Lucas over the top of them . " An interesting question , Mr. Turner . Personally , not being schooled in the law , I have no idea what the answer might be back in London . Of course , Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law is what he says it is. " * The sweat poured off Sally . The contractions were still quite far apart , but when the sharpest of them came she gritted her teeth to keep back the screams . In between she swallowed her moans and clung to Hetje 's hand . The slave never moved from her side . She wiped Sally 's brow and murmured comfort . " You doing just fine , mevrouw . That baby going to be just fine . " " What about him ? " She looked toward the hall . " I keep telling you , mevrouw . Master not be back yet . He say he not be back until it be time for his dinner . " " That 's two hours from now , " Sally whispered . " Maybe the baby will be born before then . " " No , " Hetje said . " You be just at the beginning , mevrouw . A first baby takes a while to get itself born . But you do n't be worrying . Hetje be doing everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie ? The way I told you ? " The other woman chuckled . " I made a beautiful pie , mevrouw . With pigeon and apples and currants . And good and plenty of mevrouw 's special sauce . The master going to enjoy his dinner today . Oh , yes . " Sally squeezed Hetje 's hand . " And sleep for hours after it . Enough time to ... " Sally could n't speak the words . Her eyes filled with tears . Hetje stroked her forehead with a damp cloth . " Do n't worry , mevrouw . Everything going to be fine . This baby 's going to be fine . " " Hetje , have you ... have you ever had a child ? " " Three , mevrouw . I be eleven first time they put me with a man . " " They put you . Did you care for him , Hetje ? " " Never saw him except for that one week up in the slave compound . He did it to me , and then they took him off someplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months after , I be having me a little girl . " " Where is she ? What did  --  " Another contraction took Sally 's breath away . She clung to Hetje 's hand and bit her lips to keep back any sound . " You got to breathe , mevrouw . Breathe deep each time the pain comes . " Sally gulped air . Twice , three times . The pain ebbed . " What about your little girl ? " she asked . " Where is she , Hetje ? " " Never saw her after she was four , " Hetje said . " That be when they sold her . I never knew where . " " Oh , God . Hetje , I 'm so sorry . " " Had two little boys , too . One died of the cholera when he be two . The other one got sold when he be five . " " And each time ... The fathers ... You did n't ... " " It always be like the first time . They put me with men when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it be in the compound , mevrouw . Men and women live separate . Everyone do their work by day , and by night  --  " Hetje broke off . The two women looked at each other . " ' Course , it might have been different with me , " Hetje added . " I be born to free folk . " " Truly ? " The black woman nodded . " My mama and papa be having a little farm up in the woods . In them swamplands around Minetta Brook . Governor before this one , Kieft , he wanted folks not be Indians to be living between the town and the trouble . Kieft gave my mama and papa a little ground to work and build a cabin on . Gave ' em papers , too . Said they could live free long as they gave the governor a fat pig once a year . And came into town to work whenever he needed them . " The slave wiped Sally 's face with a cool cloth . " Thank you , Hetje . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " The papers do n't say nothing about children , mevrouw . A man and a woman living free with old Governor Kieft 's papers , their children got to go to the slave compound if that 's where they be needed . That 's what happened to me . I be needed . They said eleven was time enough . They said they needed more stock , so I could n't just be let stay fallow . " Sally squeezed the black woman 's hand . " I 'm sorry for all your troubles , Hetje  --  " She gasped at the next contraction . " Hetje , what if my baby is  --  " " You stop worrying yourself , mevrouw . Your baby going to be fine . Sure to be a woman with enough milk for your baby in the compound . They wo n't let your baby die . Babies in the slave compound be valuable . Worth a lot of money once they got a few years behind ' em . That be the important thing , mevrouw . You keep thinking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At four A.M.  --  after Hetje tied a sheet to the head of the bed so her mistress could cling to it and scream only silently , after Sally had labored nearly seventeen hours  --  she pushed her child into the world . " Be a little boy , mevrouw ! " Hetje put the infant on his mother 's stomach . " A beautiful little boy ! " Sally struggled to raise her head . " A boy ... Is he all right , Hetje ? " " He be perfect , mevrouw . " The child gave one sharp cry as she spoke . Sally struggled to sit up . " Hetje , do n't let him make any noise . He must n't  --  " " You quiet yourself , mevrouw . Everything be exactly how it should be . This baby be fine . Got everything he 's supposed to have , and he can shout besides . " Hetje was tying off the cord in two places as she spoke . " I be going to cut this thing now , but do n't you worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heavy shears between the two knots and snipped . " There , that be done . You did n't feel nothing , did you ? " " Nothing . " Sally 's voice was weak with exhaustion . She put her hand on the infant 's back . " A boy , " she whispered . " My son . Hetje , where is the master ? Maybe he heard the child cry . Run out to the hall and check . " " I be out to the hall ten times in the past hour , mevrouw . Mijnheer be sleeping before and he be sleeping now . I told you , he ate that whole pie all by hisself . Did n't leave even one crumb on the plate . " " Yes , yes , you told me . " Sally laid her head back . She knew she would n't be able to fight the exhaustion much longer . Hetje reached for the child . " Got to take him now , mevrouw . Got to get him cleaned up and wrapped up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . Too frightened to trust her judgment . " What color is his skin , Hetje ? " " Nice dark little boy , mevrouw . Blackest hair you ever saw . " " Good , " Sally whispered . " That 's good . Dark . It will be better for him . " A few moments later Hetje placed the swaddled child in Sally 's arms . Sally pressed him to her . She could feel his heartbeat against her heart . The way it had been for these nine months . " My sweet baby son , " she whispered . " My darling boy . " The baby was tightly wrapped . Only his face showed , red and wrinkled , and a fringe of straight black hair . Sally kissed his forehead . She hugged him close . Hetje peered into the dark beyond the window . " Mevrouw , the watchman passed this way a little while past . He be coming again soon . Better if I go before it starts getting to be morning . " " Yes , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child close . Dear God , how could she let him be taken away ? Hetje went to the door of the bedroom and cracked it open . The only sound was that of the snores coming from the study . " He still be sleeping , mevrouw . This be the best time for Hetje to leave . " " Yes , " Sally whispered . " The best time . " She kissed her son once more . " Have your life , little one . I can not raise you , but I swore I would not let them kill you and I have kept my promise . " Then , without another word , weeping silent tears , she gave the boy to Hetje. * " Well now , " Hetje whispered to the child she had hidden beneath her shawl , standing on Pearl Street as the muffled dark gathered itself to fight off the dawn . " Looks like you and me be all alone out here . Only thing has to happen now be for Hetje to decide where to take you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her shawl a bit and peeked at the face of the infant . The redness of birth was already starting to fade . " A little white boy , " she whispered . " I be telling mevrouw you were a dark baby , because that be what she wants to hear . That be what we were counting on , the mistress and me . Since you had a white mama and a red papa , you were going to be a dark baby and I could slip you into the slave compound and no one ever be sure where you came from . But now ... What Hetje be doing with this little boy nobody be wanting ? You got any answers for me , little white baby ? " The child continued to sleep . * Lucas stared at the infant in Marit 's arms . " He 's what ? " " A foundling . Sent to us by God . I 'm sure of it . I 've never conceived , Lucas . I doubt if I  --  " " Where did you get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baby cried . Marit leaned forward and kissed the tiny face . She held the child close and began rocking back and forth . " Hush , " she whispered . " Your voice is too loud , Lucas . You are making him cry . " " Marit , I have to know what  --  " " I opened the door and there he was . First thing this morning . It was barely dawn . And I am feeding him with milk from my neighbor 's cow . Look , I 'll show you . " Marit dipped a corner of a piece of cloth into the bowl of milk on the table beside her . She put the cloth to the infant 's lips . He sucked eagerly . " See , he is a smart boy , our Nicholas . He knows  --  " " Our Ni  --  Marit , listen to me . We are to be married this afternoon , less than three months since ... since you are without a husband . That is already a huge concession . Since no minister will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preside . That is a second huge concession . " " You told me Governor Nicolls has made it legal anywhere in New York for a couple to be married by a justice of the peace . " " Yes , he has . That does n't mean the people are going to accept it . " " The English are in charge now . " She dipped the cloth in milk a second time and gave it to the baby . " The people have to accept what the English say . " " They have to act as if they accept it , but they do n't  --  " " Look , Lucas , at his eyes . Wide apart like yours . And his forehead is like yours . I think he looks like  --  " " Marit , what are we going to do if people stop coming to me for treatment ? " " You are the only real surgeon in New York , the only one people trust . " " There will be many more now that we are an English colony . Marit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is madness . " Marit held the baby closer . When she looked up at Lucas her large blue eyes were shiny with tears . " Whatever Ankel did to me , " she whispered , " whatever he threatened to do to me , I would not stop loving you . I risked everything because I love you so completely , Lucas . Now I love this child the same way . He is the only son I will ever have . How can you ask me to give him up ? " Lucas knelt beside her . " Only because it 's so dangerous , my love . Because it will put us in so much peril . " Marit reached for his hand and placed it on the baby 's chest . The infant was entirely swaddled in flannel ; only his tiny face showed . Lucas could feel the small heart beating beneath the soft cloth . The child seemed strong , healthy . " Your son , " Marit whispered . " Sent to you by God . " Lucas knew what she wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for him nothing but risk in this tiny creature Marit had so quickly come to love . " No , " he whispered . " Not my son , Marit .

And I do not care , Lucas . God placed him on the doorstep for me to find . He is to be our son . Nicholas Turner . " Lucas sighed . " I see God told you the boy 's name as well . " Marit shook her head . " Do not mock me , Lucas . Listen to me : if we do not keep him , we will be turning our back on God 's gift . Terrible things will happen to us . We have been fortunate so far . We have ... We have done everything we had to do and suffered no ill consequences . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything will change . " " Marit , how are we to explain a newborn ? What are people to think ? " " That Ankel left me with child , " she said calmly . " And who can prove differently ? " " But no one saw you with child . No one  --  " " No one noticed . They noticed only my constant weeping these months since  --  " " The onion wife , " he said softly . He 'd been teasing her with the phrase since she began keeping a peeled onion in the storeroom , inhaling the fumes until tears streamed down her cheeks and she looked like a grieving widow . " Yes , " she said , smiling at him . " The onion wife . But no longer , Lucas . After today , the joyful , contented wife of the barber . And the mother of Nicholas . " " Ankel Jannssen 's legacy , " Lucas whispered . " Very well , so be it . " * Van der Vries searched the entire house , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went again to stand at the foot of Sally 's bed . " Tell me once more what happened . " " My labor began . Hetje helped me . The child was born dead . This morning at four of the clock . I did not wish to look at the corpse . Hetje got rid of it for me . " The slave was kneeling beside the fireplace meanwhile , laying the logs for a new fire . Van der Vries walked over to her . " What did you do with the child ? " Hetje looked up at him . " Mevrouw said she do n't want it be buried anywhere around here . So I be tying a rock to that baby and go down by the wharf and throw it in the sea . No one never going to see that dead baby , Master . You do n't have to worry about that . Only the fishes be going to  --  " Van der Vries began unbuckling his belt . " Let 's just see if you tell the same story after  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bed . " You must not beat her . The baby is dead . You wanted it gone and it 's gone . What else can you want to know ? " " That I 'm not being duped , " Van der Vries said softly . " That my wife and my slave are not taking me for a fool . " " We are not . " Sally looked directly at him . " And beating Hetje , or me for that matter , will do nothing to sweeten the atmosphere in your household , Jacob Van der Vries . It will not make your simpling room more productive . " " Ah yes , my simpling room . That raises another question . Why I slept so soundly for so long . Not even in my own bed , but in my chair . How did that happen , mevrouw ? Have you any notion ? " " Hetje knows that you enjoy the brew I make from poppies . She did not know it was not for use in cooking . I have explained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der Vries looked from one woman to the other . " See it does not , " he said finally . Then : " Hetje , leave us . I wish to speak privately with the mevrouw . " Van der Vries waited until the door closed ; then he approached the bed and suddenly , without warning , threw back the quilt . Sally cowered . " Stay where you are , " Van der Vries commanded . She half raised herself on her elbows , staring up at him . Van der Vries spent some time looking at her , though he did not disturb her nightdress . Finally he put his hand on her belly . It was still swollen , though considerably smaller than it had been , and soft and flabby where before it had been hard . " I feel no heartbeat , " he admitted . " In God 's name , how could you ? I told you , the child was born dead some nine hours past . " " Yes , you told me . " He took his hand away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will discuss it no further . Governor Nicolls is giving a reception for the townspeople next week . I wish you to attend with me . It does a man no harm to have an English wife in these times . You have turned out to be a greater asset than I ever imagined , mevrouw . Well worth sixty guilders . " Sally did n't see him for two days . Then , on the third night after her child had been born , as she lay staring at the ceiling , trying to imagine how she was going to bear the rest of her life , her door opened . Van der Vries stood there , carrying a candle . " Ah , you 're awake . " " Yes . What do you want ? " He came into the room , closed the door behind him , then walked to the bed . " I want what it is your duty to give me , " he said softly . " My marital rights . " He set the candle on the night table , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mevrouw , lift your linen . I wish to see exactly what it is I have bought . " This time Sally did n't cower . She pulled the hem of her nightdress to her neck . Hetje had wrapped her breasts to keep the milk back . Van der Vries looked at the bindings and nodded . He examined the rest of her . " Skinny , " he muttered under his breath . " No bargain for looks . But there are other advantages . " He leaned over , blew out the candle , and climbed on top of her .
