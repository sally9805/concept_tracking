Chapter One In the desert I saw a creature , naked , bestial , Who , squatting upon the ground , Held his heart in his hands , And ate of it .... - Stephen Crane , " The Black Riders and Other Lines " Long before the ancient Aztecs and Egyptians ever dreamed of making mummies , nature had perfected her technique . First take a corpse-a human 's , for example-and protect it from the ravages of predators and weather . Then find a quick way to strip the body 's tissues of all water content . Dry winds do a fine job , providing the unfortunate 's final resting place is cold enough to discourage hungry insects . But even in a hot locale-say the arid country of West Texas-certain natural compounds serve the purpose quite as well . One of the most effective substances is common salt , including the white crystals surrounding a body in a cavern so far beneath the desert 's surface , the coyotes and the turkey vultures never sense its presence . And neither do the searchers , whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt for one missing woman amid the hundreds of square miles where rattlesnakes outnumber humans and scorpions have outlasted every species since the dinosaurs . Could she speak , our modern mummy might beg the searchers to look longer and look deeper . But , of course , she 's been beyond that for some time . * * * Dana Vanover stopped dead in the middle of the hallway of Texas Children 's Hospital in Houston . Her head was already shaking as her mother turned . " I 'm not doing this , " Dana told her . " I 'm sorry for these people , Mom . Truly sorry their daughter 's condition is so serious . But I do n't want to get to know them . I do n't want to feel ... " Her mother arched an elegantly sculpted blond brow and folded arms both tanned and toned from tennis . Her latest cosmetic procedures might have smoothed the lines from her face , but they did nothing to erase the disapproval . " Feel what , Dana ? Sympathy for the only grandchild I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormed toward the elevator , her long strides easily outdistancing her mother 's . The staccato click-click of high-heeled sandals trailed her . " Please , Dana , let 's not dwell on- " Isabel 's voice rose to a squeak . Dana turned in time to see her mother toppling forward and reacted reflexively to save her from a fall . " You all right , Mom ? " She scanned quickly , her gaze sliding from her mother 's sleek blond pageboy haircut to the summery green-and-white dress . " I ... I 'm fine , " she said , then pointed down at the pretty pear green sandals to indicate a broken strap . " The price of vanity , I guess . " As she extricated herself from Dana 's grip , her mother shuddered at the unexpected touch . Isabel Smith-Vanover Huffington tried to hide it , but Dana knew very well that she loathed all forms of physical contact , particularly those that took her by surprise . Dana had once heard whispers of abuse in her mother 's childhood , but no one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . " One day you 're going to break your neck in those things . " " If I do , at least I wo n't be caught dead in those abominations you insist on wearing . " Dana frowned at her . " Right . " But it was n't the insult to her Birkenstocks that grated . " Oh , for heaven 's sake . You must know I was joking . " Her mother took a deep breath , then reached for Dana 's elbow . At the last instant she dropped her hand instead and kicked off the broken sandal , then bent to pick it up . " We 've come this far . Please . " She bobbed along a step or two before Dana stopped again beside a brightly colored mural of cheerful cartoon animals . " She 's really not your grandchild , or my niece either . Angie saw to that when she put her up for adoption . Nikki belongs to the Harrisons . We were never even meant to know about her . And we never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tears welled in her mother 's green eyes . " They 've asked for our help . To save that dear child 's life . " Isabel had learned of the " dear child " only when a private investigator had landed on her doorstep three weeks earlier , yet here she stood , playing the queen of empathy , though she had never shown more than ill-disguised revulsion for her own two daughters ' illnesses . Had Nikki Harrison and her parents really won Isabel over during her first , brief visit to the cancer center , or was she merely trying on the role of distraught grandmother to see how well it suited ? " We 've both been tested , " Dana told her , " and if the match had been good I would have gladly donated bone marrow for a transplant . But it 's not a possibility , and I ca n't afford to get any more involved in this- " " You used to be such a caring girl . And you still do so much good . For animals , at least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about her canine and feline patients than about people . " I told you , I am sorry . But I ca n't bleed for everybody , Mom . I do n't have the energy right now . I have a veterinary clinic operating at a loss , thanks to the time I took off after my surgery . And I still have a ton of wedding gifts to send back , along with some pretty damned awkward notes to go with them- " " You have n't finished that yet ? " Her mother 's eyes shot wide . " Oh , Dana . It 's been more than three months now . What on earth are people going to think ? " Dana did n't have an answer . She felt guilty enough without Isabel hammering the nail in deeper . After passing a nurses ' station , her mother paused to check the room numbers on a sign before she turned a corner . Still hobbling , she made careful progress while Dana followed in her wake , helpless as a leaf drawn by the current . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom . Sorry I wo n't be giving you a grandchild . Sorry I have n't been able to write your friends to tell them , ' Here 's your Waterford dust catcher back ; thanks anyway . Alex , the rat bastard fianc , thought the whole **26;700;TOOLONG thing was too much of a downer . ' " She wanted to deck the sniveling coward every time she thought about how he had dumped her by text message and then ducked the resulting shit storm with a quick transfer to the New York office of his brokerage firm . " And I 'm especially sorry I ca n't get sucked into another of my big sister 's dramas right now . " People were giving her a wide berth as she passed them : a frail-looking young mother towing a small boy by the hand , a round-faced woman in raspberry-bright scrubs pushing a cart of trays that stank of steamed broccoli and heart-healthy chicken . Poor , sick kids were going to love that . " You 're making a scene , " her mother whispered as she hobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to save that sweet child . When you see how hard her parents are praying for a miracle , how totally devoted they are to- " Still following , Dana cut her off . " There 's no guarantee Angie 's going to be a match , even if we did know where to find her . She still has n't cashed those checks , right ? " Dana and her sister each received a modest monthly stipend from a trust fund set up after their father 's death . Neither would come into the full amount until she turned thirty-five . For Angie that was less than a year away . Then she 'd be free to blow $2.4 million on her various addictions . Until then , however , she depended on the monthly payments . But Dana was n't too worried just because Angie had put off cashing the last two mailed to her . It probably meant she 'd drifted into a relationship with a man content to pay the bills for as long as the ride lasted . Or possibly she was so into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs-or even food . Or maybe she 'd hooked up with some commune and given over all her cares to Jesus . Where Angie was concerned , almost anything could happen-except another rescue from her sister . That ship had sailed-and sunk-already . " She has n't cashed them , " Isabel confirmed , " and when I called , the sheriff told me no one 's seen her in at least two months . But she ca n't have gone far . He found her car out by the house where she was living . Apparently the engine 's gone bad . Something about a cracked block , maybe ? " Dana felt the first frisson of unease then . " What about her loom ? " " He says as far as he can tell , all her things are still there . And I asked especially about the loom . " It 's not my problem , not my problem , not my problem . Dana repeated the words until they blended like a mantra . Angie had sworn at her for rushing to the rescue the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before that . And if I have to fight with her now , on top of everything else ... Dana rubbed her temples , but she could n't hold back her concern . Troubled though she might be , Angie would n't leave her loom behind . Not that one thing , not ever . Once , during a rare calm visit while Angie was in rehab , she had described it to Dana as her only constant : the shuttle that married the varied strands of warp to weft and wove scant snatches of peace out of her chaos . She could become almost poetic when she talked about it . Angelina Morningstar , she called her weaver self , the artist . Other people called her that , too , and during her more stable periods , " Angelina " made good money selling work inspired by years of cultural anthropology courses that had never quite translated into a degree . " Maybe you should fly out there and check on her . " Dana 's suggestion slipped out before she could stop herself , though she already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a closed door . " Heaven knows I 'd like to . But you know very well she 'll head for the hills if she hears I 'm within a hundred miles . Besides , Jerome has put his foot down this time . " Although her mother 's husband of six years loved nothing more than seeing his name listed among the big-time benefactors of well-publicized charitable endeavors , the real estate developer had never approved of his wife " enabling " Angie 's irresponsible behavior . But Dana suspected Isabel was using him as an excuse , that she would far rather send her younger daughter as an emissary and throw money at the trouble than risk yet another heartbreak . It was tough to fault her mother , since Dana wished that she could do the same thing , wished that the buck did n't always stop , inevitably , with her . " I 'm not doing it this time , " she insisted . " And I 'm not going to make the Harrison family 's tragedy mine . " Her mother raised her knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the intersection of Shrewd and Appraising . " Come inside for just a minute . We 'll need to wash and put on masks and gowns . Then we can meet the Harrisons . Do that much for me , and I swear I 'll never bring up this subject again . " Not my problem , not my problem , not my problem , went the mantra . But the moment Nikki Harrison looked up at her through Angie 's brown eyes , Dana 's resolution shattered , along with her vow to stay out of her sister 's life and get her own on track .
