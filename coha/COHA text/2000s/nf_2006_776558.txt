Foreword // // In August 2004 , Julia Child and I sat in her small , lush garden in Montecito , California , talking about her life . She was thin and a bit stooped , but more vigorous than she ? d been in weeks . We were in the midst of writing this book together . When I asked her what she remembered about Paris in the 1950s , she recalled that she had learned to cook everything from snails to wild boar at the Cordon Bleu ; that marketing in France had taught her the value of " les human relations " ; she lamented that in her day the American housewife had to juggle cooking the soup and boiling the diapers  --  adding , " if she mixed the two together , imagine what a lovely combination that would make ! " // The idea for My Life in France had been gestating since 1969 , when her husband , Paul , sifted through hundreds of letters that he and Julia had written his twin brother , Charles Child ( my grandfather ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the letters about their favorite , formative years together . But for one reason or another , the book never got written . Paul died in 1994 , aged ninety-two . // Yet Julia never gave up on the idea , and would often talk about her intention to write " the France book . " She saw it , in part , as a tribute to her husband , the man who had swept her off to Paris in the first place . // I was a professional writer , and had long wanted to work on a collaborative project with Julia . But she was self-reliant , and for years had politely resisted the idea . In December 2003 , she once again mentioned " the France book , " in a wistful tone , and I again offered to assist her . She was ninety-one , and her health had been waxing and waning . This time she said , " All right , dearie , maybe we should work on it together . " // My job was simply to help Julia tell her story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a natural performer , she was essentially a private person who didn ? t like to reveal herself . We started slowly , began to work in sync , and eventually built a wonderfully productive routine . For a few days every month , I ? d sit in her living room asking questions , reading from family letters , and listening to her stories . At first I taped our conversations , but when she began to poke my tape recorder with her long fingers , I realized it was distracting her , and took notes instead . The longer we talked about " little old France , " the more she remembered , often with vivid intensity  --  " Ooh , those lovely roasted , buttery French chickens , they were so good and chickeny ! " // Many of our best conversations took place over a meal , on a car ride , or during a visit to a farmers ? market . Something would trigger a memory , and she ? d suddenly tell me about how she learned to make baguettes in Paris , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner party  --  " Just speak very loudly and quickly , and state your position with utter conviction , as the French do , and you ? ll have a marvelous time ! " // Almost all of the words in these pages are Julia ? s or Paul ? s . But this is not a scholarly work , and at times I have blended their voices . Julia encouraged this approach , pointing out that she and Paul often signed their letters " PJ " or " Pulia , " as if they were two halves of one person . I wrote some of the exposition and transitions , and in so doing tried to emulate Julia ? s idiosyncratic word choices  --  " Plop ! , " " Yuck ! , " " Woe ! , " " Hooray ! " Once I had gathered enough material , I would write up a vignette ; she would avidly read it , correct my French , and add things as they occurred to her in small , rightward-slanting handwriting . She loved this process , and was an exacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared . // Julia and I shared a sense of humor , and appetite , and she thought I looked like Paul , which probably helped our collaboration . As for me , I was grateful for the chance to reconnect with her and to be part of such an interesting project . Some writers find that the more they learn about their co-authors the less they like them , but I had the opposite experience : the more I learned about Julia Child , the more I came to respect her . What impressed me most was how hard she worked , how devoted she was to the " rules " of la cuisine fran ? aise while keeping herself open to creative exploration , and how determined she was to persevere in the face of setbacks . Julia never lost her sense of wonder and inquisitiveness . She was , and is , a great inspiration . // Another great inspiration has been our editor , Judith Jones , who worked with Julia for more than forty years . With patience and a deep understanding of our subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judith ? s assistant , Ken Schneider , was also a great help . // On August 13 , 2004  --  just after our conversation in her garden , and only two days before her ninety-second birthday  --  Julia died of kidney failure in her sleep . Over the next year , I finished My Life in France , but every day wished I could call her up and ask her to clarify a story , or to share a bit of news , or just to talk . I miss her . But through her words in these pages , Julia ? s voice remains as lively , wise , and encouraging as ever . As she would say , " We had such fun ! " // Alex Prud ? homme // August 2005 // Introduction // This is a book about some of the things I have loved most in life : my husband , Paul Child ; la belle France ; and the many pleasures of cooking and eating . It is also something new for me . Rather than a collection of recipes , I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly focused on the years 1948 through 1954 , when we lived in Paris and Marseille , and also a few of our later adventures in Provence . Those early years in France were among the best of my life . They marked a crucial period of transformation in which I found my true calling , experienced an awakening of the senses , and had such fun that I hardly stopped moving long enough to catch my breath . // Before I moved to France , my life had not prepared me for what I would discover there . I was raised in a comfortable , WASPy , uppermiddle- class family in sunny and non-intellectual Pasadena , California . My father , John McWilliams , was a conservative businessman who managed family real-estate holdings ; my mother , Carolyn , whom we called Caro , was a very warm and social person . But , like most of her peers , she didn ? t spend much time in the kitchen . She occasionally sallied forth to whip up baking-powder biscuits , or a cheese dish , or finnan haddie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // As a girl I had zero interest in the stove . I ? ve always had a healthy appetite , especially for the wonderful meat and the fresh produce of California , but I was never encouraged to cook and just didn ? t see the point in it . Our family had a series of hired cooks , and they ? d produce heaping portions of typical American fare  --  fat roasted chicken with buttery mashed potatoes and creamed spinach ; or well-marbled porterhouse steaks ; or aged leg of lamb cooked medium gray  --  not pinky-red rare , as the French do  --  and always accompanied by brown gravy and green mint sauce . It was delicious but not refined food . // Paul , on the other hand , had been raised in Boston by a rather bohemian mother who had lived in Paris and was an excellent cook . He was a cultured man , ten years older than I was , and by the time we met , during World War II , he had already traveled the world . Paul was a natty dresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wine . He knew about dishes like moules marini ? res and boeuf bourguignon and canard ? l ? orange  --  things that seemed hopelessly exotic to my untrained ear and tongue . I was lucky to marry Paul . He was a great inspiration , his enthusiasm about wine and food helped to shape my tastes , and his encouragement saw me through discouraging moments . I would never have had my career without Paul Child . // We ? d first met in Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) during the Second World War and were married in September 1946 . In preparation for living with a new husband on a limited government income , I decided I ? d better learn how to cook . Before our wedding , I took a bride-to-be ? s cooking course from two Englishwomen in Los Angeles , who taught me to make things like pancakes . But the first meal I ever cooked for Paul was a bit more ambitious : brains simmered in red wine ! I ? m not quite sure why I picked that particular dish , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to impress my new husband . I skimmed over the recipe , and figured it wouldn ? t be too hard to make . But the results , alas , were messy to look at and not very good to eat . In fact , the dinner was a disaster . Paul laughed it off , and we scrounged up something else that night . But deep down I was annoyed with myself , and I grew more determined than ever to learn how to cook well . // In our first year as young marrieds , we lived in Georgetown , in Washington , D.C. , in a small white clapboard house on Olive Avenue . While Paul worked on mounting exhibits for the State Department , I worked as a file clerk . In the evening , I would approach the stove armed with lofty intentions , the Joy of Cooking or Gourmet magazine tucked under my arm , and little kitchen sense . My meals were satisfactory , but they took hours of laborious effort to produce . I ? d usually plop something on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse into bed . Paul was unfailingly patient . But years later he ? d admit to an interviewer : " Her first attempts were not altogether successful . . . . I was brave because I wanted to marry Julia . I trust I did not betray my point of view . " ( He did not. ) // In the winter of 1948 , Paul was offered a job running the Visual Presentation Department for the United States Information Service ( USIS ) in Paris , and I tagged along . I had never been to Europe , but once we had settled in Paris , it was clear that , out of sheer luck , I had landed in a magical city  --  one that is still my favorite place on earth . Starting slowly , and then with a growing enthusiasm , I devoted myself to learning the language and the customs of my new home . // In Paris and later in Marseille , I was surrounded by some of the best food in the world , and I had an enthusiastic audience in my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to cook la cuisine bourgeoise  --  good , traditional French home cooking . It was a revelation . I simply fell in love with that glorious food and those marvelous chefs . The longer we stayed there , the deeper my commitment became . // In collaborating on this book , Alex Prud ? homme and I have been fortunate indeed to have spent hours together telling stories , reminiscing , and thinking out loud . Memory is selective , and we have not attempted to be encyclopedic here , but have focused on some of the large and small moments that stuck with me for over fifty years . // Alex was born in 1961 , the year that our first book , Mastering the Art of French Cooking , which I wrote with Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle , was published . How appropriate , then , that he and I should work together on this volume , which recounts the making of that book . // Our research has been aided immeasurably by a thick trove of family letters and datebooks kept from those days , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Valentine ? s Day cards . Paul and his twin brother , Charlie Child , a painter who lived in Bucks County , Pennsylvania , wrote to each other every week or so . Paul took letter writing seriously : he ? d set aside time for it , tried to document our day-to-day lives in a journalistic way , and usually wrote three to six pages a week in a beautiful flowing hand with a special fountain pen ; often he included little sketches of places we ? d visited , or photos ( some of which we have used in these pages ) , or made mini-collages out of ticket stubs or newsprint . My letters were usually one or two pages , typed , and full of spelling mistakes , bad grammar , and exclamation points ; I tended to focus on what I was cooking at the time , or the human dramas boiling around us . Written on thin pale-blue or white airmail paper , those hundreds of letters have survived the years in very good shape . // When I reread them now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great immediacy : Paul noticing the brilliant sparkle of autumn light on the dark Seine , his daily battles with Washington bureaucrats , the smell of Montmartre at dusk , or the night we spied wild-haired Colette eating at that wonderful Old World restaurant Le Grand V ? four . In my letters , I enthuse over my first taste of a toothsome French duck roasted before an open fire , or the gossip I ? d heard from the vegetable lady in the Rue de Bourgogne marketplace , or the latest mischief of our cat , Minette , or the failures and triumphs of our years of cookbook work . It is remarkable that our family had the foresight to save those letters  --  it ? s almost as if they knew Alex and I were going to sit down and write this book together one day . // We tip our hats in gratitude to the many people and institutions who have helped us with My Life in France , especially to my dear friend and lifelong editor at Knopf , Judith Jones , she of the gimlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French " sisters , " Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle , with whom I collaborated ; to my sister , Dorothy , my enthusiastic niece , Phila Cousins , and her brother , Sam ; to my invaluable assistant , Stephanie Hersh , and my attorney Bill Truslow . We also sing the praises of the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute , which has graciously housed the bulk of my papers and Paul ? s photographs ; the Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution , which has been kind enough to display artifacts from my career , including my entire kitchen from our house in Cambridge , Massachusetts ; to WGBH , Boston ? s public television station ; to my alma mater , Smith College ; also to the many family members and friends who have aided us with memories , photos , good company , and fine meals as we pieced together this volume . // What fun and good fortune I had living in France with Paul , and again in writing about our experiences with Alex . I hope that this book is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to put together  --  bon app ? tit ! // Julia Child // Montecito , California // August 2004 //
