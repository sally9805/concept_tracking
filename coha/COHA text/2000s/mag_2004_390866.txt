Insights create a new order for disordered sleep <p> Early last December , an 8-year-old boy showed up in Sameer Zuberi 's pediatric neurology clinic in Glasgow , Scotland . Previously healthy and active , the child had suddenly become unable to stay awake , and he described vivid , dreamlike hallucinations . His mother told the physicians at Glasgow 's Royal Hospital for Sick Children that her son was no longer attending school and had dropped all outside activities , including his favorite and most successful one , tae kwon do . <p> For Zuberi and his colleagues , the diagnosis was easy : The boy had experienced a dramatic onset of severe narcolepsy . After standard narcolepsy drugs failed to relieve his symptoms , however , the medical team realized that his treatment would be a challenge . <p> Acting on a tip from other researchers , the doctors offered their patient a novel therapy . With his parents ' permission , they gave the boy a large intravenous dose of molecules called immune globulins . Physicians use these components of donated blood to treat several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system . Zuberi was betting on a hypothesis that narcolepsy results from an immune attack that impairs the brain 's control of wakefulness , dreaming , and sleep . <p> The bet paid off , at least for a time . By Christmas , the boy 's mother reported to the researchers that her son was up and about . <p> " The benefit lasted for about 3 months , " Zuberi says . When the boy 's narcolepsy returned , another dose of the blood components again alleviated some of his symptoms temporarily . The boy has since returned to the hospital for a third round of immune-globulin treatment . <p> Encouraged by the therapy 's modest success , Zuberi subsequently gave immune globulins to a teenage patient who 'd had narcolepsy since she was a toddler . She showed no improvement , he says . <p> " If you act very quickly at the onset of the disease , immune therapy may be useful , " infers Mehdi Tafti of Geneva University Hospitals in Switzerland . He and his colleagues were the first to use immune globulins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential treatments for the young martial-arts champ , Zuberi read a prepublication copy of Tafti 's case report , which described two other cases and appeared in the December 2003 Journal of Sleep Research . <p> The recent cases highlight current options and challenges in dealing with narcolepsy . More than a century has passed since physicians first observed and labeled the syndrome , which consists of excessive daytime sleepiness and , typically , several other symptoms , including hallucinations and episodes of paralysis and muscle weakness . <p> Until just a few years ago , however , scientists knew next to nothing about what causes narcolepsy . They did devise some diagnostic tests and develop symptom-suppressing drugs , but those innovations are n't always effective . <p> Recent advances in understanding the disorder 's biological underpinnings-in particular , the importance of a hormone called orexin-have created a new diagnostic tool and point toward more successful therapies . By illuminating how the brain regulates sleep , moreover , these new findings may eventually yield drugs that give healthy people unprecedented control over sleep and alertness . Disordered sleep <p> Narcolepsy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stay awake . The complex disorder features sleep-related brain activities that , at night , occur out of their normal sequence and , during the day , intrude into wakefulness . Narcolepsy is a " completely disordered sleep process , " says Emmanuel Mignot of Stanford University School of Medicine . <p> Symptoms can include dreamlike visions and sensations of momentary paralysis , both of which strike most often as narcoleptic people are falling asleep or waking up . Also , when they doze , they often fall immediately into a stage of sleep called rapid eye movement , or REM , which in other people does n't begin until more than an hour after they 've fallen asleep . Another common sign of narcolepsy is complete loss of muscle tone , a condition that healthy people experience only during REM sleep . <p> During waking attacks of this condition , called cataplexy , a person remains alert but become limp and can fall . " It 's a very unique symptom that 's only observed in patients with narcolepsy , " says Seiji Nishino , a Stanford colleague of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions , such as surprise , anguish , or elation . <p> In a similar but much milder way , those strong feelings might make healthy people drop their jaw or feel weak at the knees , Nishino says . <p> Drugs such as modafinil ( Provigil ) reduce daytime sleepiness in some people with narcolepsy . Certain antidepressants and a newly available drug called sodium oxybate ( Xyrem ) can mitigate cataplexy . But no standard therapy repairs the broken structure of sleep that defines narcolepsy , the researchers say . <p> People acquire narcolepsy at various ages . Genetics appears to play a role in some instances of the disorder , but most cases show no trail of inherited risk . Tafti reported in the April 10 Lancet a case in which one of a pair of identical twins had orexin deficiency and narcolepsy ; the other had normal orexin concentrations and was healthy . <p> Researchers suspect that something in people 's surroundings must ultimately determine who develops the disorder . " We 've scratched our heads quite a bit about what that environmental factor could be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hattiesburg . He and other researchers propose that exposure to some chemical or microbe during fetal development or early in life may predispose a genetically susceptible person 's immune system to attack sleep-controlling areas of the brain . <p> One clue is that a person 's risk for narcolepsy appears to depend on the month of his or her birth . People born in March are 45 percent more likely than the general population to develop narcolepsy , while September babies have 37 percent less risk for narcolepsy than the overall population . Other months of birth have no apparent influence . An international team of researchers reported those findings in the Sept. 15 , 2003 Sleep . <p> The study included nearly 900 patients from any one of three narcolepsy clinics in Canada , France , and the United States . Since all three populations exhibited the same seasonal pattern , it 's unlikely that the finding is a fluke , contends Tafti , who worked on the study . <p> Using data on the birthdays of 530 U.S. residents with narcolepsy , Harsh recently replicated the finding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a March surplus and a September falloff " in risk , Harsh says . " It 's uncanny how specific the peak is to March . " <p> Colds caught by women during the second trimester of pregnancy could be a factor in narcolepsy , Harsh speculates . Maternal infections can upset the fetal immune system , which is particularly sensitive during that developmental period . An infant born in March enters its second trimester the previous September , and that 's when cold infections are most common , he says . <p> Tafti notes that birth in March has previously been linked to elevated risk for multiple sclerosis , an autoimmune disease of the nervous system that is associated with viral infections . <p> The seasonality of narcolepsy risk offers circumstantial evidence for a longstanding hypothesis that the disorder is tied to autoimmunity . Two decades ago , researchers observed a link between the sleep disorder and a particular variant for a gene called HLA-DQB1 . This is one of several genes that provide important instructions to the immune system , and defects in them can contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success-for evidence that people with narcolepsy suffer from an autoimmune attack . " Although that 's still our leading hypothesis , we do n't really have anything positive to hang it on , " says Michael Thorpy of Montefiore Medical Center in New York City . Orexin revolution <p> While the trigger for narcolepsy remains uncertain , a string of recent discoveries has improved scientists ' grasp of the biological flaw . <p> The progress began in 1998 , when scientists described previously unrecognized molecules that transmit certain signals between neurons in the brain . Masashi Yanagisawa and his colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas were among the hormone 's discoverers . They dubbed it orexin , after the Greek word for hunger , because they found that injections of it stimulate appetite in mice . Other researchers called the novel hormone hypocretin , and the terms remain interchangeable . <p> After the discovery of orexin , Yanagisawa 's team created mice with a gene alteration that left the animals without the hormone . The researchers had hoped to use orexin to manipulate hunger . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At nearly the same time , Mignot and several of his colleagues at Stanford discovered that a rare genetic mutation in dogs blocks the brain 's response to orexin . That mutation produces a canine form of narcolepsy ( SN : 8/14/99 , p. 100 ) . <p> Mignot 's team and an independent group of researchers led by Jerome Siegel of the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) subsequently autopsied narcoleptic patients and examined the small area that normally contains orexin-making neurons in the brain region known as the hippocampus . Most people with narcolepsy had somehow lost these cells , the researchers found ( SN : 9/2/00 , p. 148 ) . Consequently , orexin was nearly or entirely missing from the fluid bathing the brain and spinal cord . <p> This series of discoveries suggests that the neurons that make orexin are probably a target of an autoimmune attack that leads to narcolepsy , Mignot says . <p> The findings represent " stunning progress " and a " big step forward to understanding " the disorder , says Harsh . <p> Since implicating orexin deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in animals to see whether it might work as a drug in people . The approach is conceptually similar to giving injections of insulin to people who have diabetes . <p> Yanagisawa and his colleagues in Texas recently genetically engineered mice so that , although they have no orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus , they produce orexin elsewhere in brain regions that do n't normally make the hormone . Unlike orexin-deficient mice , which are narcoleptic and cataplectic , the new mice sleep and act normally . <p> In other experiments , the researchers injected orexin into the brains of orexin-deficient mice and found that the treatment briefly increased wakefulness and suppressed cataplexy . The findings appear in the March 30 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . <p> " Replacement therapy is very promising , " Nishino says , but it faces practical obstacles . For one thing , orexin molecules break down rapidly in the body , so long-term treatment is likely to depend on frequent doses . That makes it impractical to inject the hormone directly into the brain . Yet orexin molecules do n't normally enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to introduce the chemicals , Nishino says . <p> Several years ago , Siegel and his UCLA colleagues reported improvements in the symptoms of Doberman pinschers with narcolepsy and cataplexy when they injected a form of orexin into the dogs ' bloodstreams . Other researchers , however , say they do n't understand how the compound could work in the dogs , which have a genetic mutation that impedes neurons from recognizing or responding to orexin . <p> In an attempt to reproduce the UCLA findings , Nishino , Mignot , and their Stanford colleagues injected the same form of orexin intravenously into Dobermans with narcolepsy but saw no effect . Administering the hormone directly into the brain briefly increased wakefulness in nonnarcoleptic dogs , but the animals showed no other change in symptoms , the researchers reported in the Dec. 15 , 2003 Sleep . <p> " Most likely , using orexin itself is not going to work , " says Mignot . What 's needed , he says , is an agonist-a molecule that mimics the hormone 's activity-that can make its way into the brain after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company will be lucky and will hit on this , " he predicts . <p> Yanagisawa agrees that such an agonist will provide the " fundamental cure " for narcolepsy . Such a drug might serve other purposes too , he says . <p> " An orexin agonist may well make you leaner , " Yanagisawa says . He and his colleagues have conducted preliminary studies of healthy , nonnarcoleptic mice that indicate that both alertness and metabolism pick up when animals receive the hormone . <p> Pharmaceutical companies do n't typically regard narcolepsy drugs as potential blockbusters . But orexin agonists could see enormous demand if they can also treat other sleep problems or , as Yanagisawa suggests , facilitate weight loss by accelerating metabolism . <p> Understanding orexin 's role in narcolepsy can also aid physicians in diagnosing the disease . In standard tests , patients are asked to try either to fall asleep or stay awake while physicians monitor certain brain activities . The results rule narcolepsy in or out in most cases . <p> Orexin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid offer the first biological test for narcolepsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by spinal tap , can provide a quick , clear diagnosis . " It 's the best test , the most definitive you can get , " he says , adding that many cases of narcolepsy have gone unrecognized for years . <p> Mignot 's group performs the orexin test for some physicians because , as yet , there 's no commercial version . Zuberi , for instance , sometimes sends samples from Scotland to California to confirm a diagnosis . <p> In contrast , Thorpy says that he rarely recommends testing the orexin concentration in a patient 's cerebrospinal fluid . He says that a normal reading , in that test do n't completely rule out narcolepsy , and any spinal tap carries some risk . Turn back the attack <p> While waiting for research on orexin-based pharmacology to bear fruit , physicians are applying their expanded understanding of narcolepsy . Some are acting on the collective hunch that narcolepsy results from an autoimmune attack . <p> " It may be that the attack is ongoing for a period , and then the process burns out , " Nishino says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orexin-producing neurons are already gone " by the time symptoms become noticeable , he says . <p> But prompt suppression of the immune attack might prevent the full manifestation of the disorder . That logic motivated Tafti 's and Zuberi 's groups to give immune globulins to the young patients last year . <p> " We 're probably going to be trying this treatment in a few other children in the next few months , " Zuberi recently told Science News . He adds , " There 's no reason it should n't work in adults as well . " <p> Tafti 's team has now given immune globulins to several other patients with recent onset of narcolepsy . While immune-globulin therapy reduced cataplexy , " it does n't seem to have much effect on sleepiness , " Tafti notes . Although his patients report that they feel less sleepiness , they show little improvement on objective tests of their propensity to fall asleep against their will . Perhaps immune globulins deflect a prong of the autoimmune attack that 's responsible for cataplexy but do n't avert the process that impairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented or reversed orexin deficiency , which could be a clue to the limited effectiveness of the therapy , Tafti notes . <p> Zuberi says , " Its principal role may well be in individuals who are diagnosed soon after onset of narcolepsy , which means it 's going to be more important that we diagnose it early . Perhaps by treating them quickly , we can alter their long-term outlook . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : PLAYING DEAD ? A narcolepsy symptom called cataplexy causes some dogs to collapse when they get excited , as they have here during a tussle . The dogs have a genetic defect that affects a brain hormone that 's missing in people with the sleep disorder . <p> By Ben Harder <p>
