<p> Several years ago , during the kind of rain delay that plagued the Masters Saturday afternoon , Curtis Strange and Jay Haas were killing time in the locker room , talking about how much they enjoyed coming to Augusta to play every year . <p> " You know we need to get moving here , " Haas said to his friend and former college teammate . " If we do n't win here pretty soon , they 're going to kick us out of here someday . " <p> He was only half-joking . Strange and Haas had each come close to winning the Masters  --  Strange tied for second in 1985 and Haas tied for third 10 years later  --  but they had never won . The rules at the Masters are simple : Win a green jacket and you can come back forever ; if you do n't , no matter how close you may have come , the invitations someday stop arriving . <p> Haas , who has played in 21 Masters , is n't here this year . Strange , who played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course they are n't alone . The most famous non-winner of the Masters , Greg Norman , has n't been here since 2002 . Norman could have won in 1986 but lost out to Jack Nicklaus 's historic 65 on the final day . He probably should have won in 1987 but watched in disbelief while Larry Mize holed his 140-foot chip shot on No. 11 , the second playoff hole , to beat him . In 1996 , he led by six strokes after 54 holes only to suffer perhaps the most stunning collapse in golf history , losing by five to Nick Faldo . He even had one more chance in 1999 before Jose Maria Olazabal simply outplayed him on the back nine Sunday . <p> Mize , who is now 47 and has n't won on the PGA Tour since 1993 , not only played this week but made the cut for the first time since 2000 . Mize is only a partially exempt player on the PGA Tour these days , meaning he likely wo n't get into more than a dozen events this year . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has failed to regain full status . But , whatever else happens in his career , he knows he can come back here every April , hang out in the champions locker room with all the other Masters champions and play in the tournament . <p> " There are a lot of great things that come with being a Masters champion , " he said . " But the best of them all may be knowing you get to come back to Augusta and play every year for as long as you can walk the golf course . " <p> Tom Lehman , this year 's U.S. Ryder Cup captain , has played in 13 Masters . In 1993 , he finished third in his first Masters . The next year he finished second . Robert Wrenn , a longtime tour player-turned-TV announcer , shook his head when those performances came up . <p> " At the very least , " he said , " they ought to give Tom a green shirt . " <p> Lehman did n't even get a green tie , and even though he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit an invitation if he wants to play again , after missing the cut Friday by shooting 76-75 . The Masters is an invitational ; there is no qualifying like in the U.S. Open and the British Open . You either meet one of the criteria  --  which include a top 16 finish in the previous Masters ; top 40 on the U.S. money list ; top 50 in the world rankings and various amateur titles  --  or you do n't . <p> The Masters is the only one of the four majors that gives its champions a lifetime exemption . The U.S. Open grants a 10-year exemption ; the British Open and PGA Championship allow players to come back until they are 65 . Here , there are no expiration dates . <p> " I do n't think any of us want to play when we ca n't play anymore , " Charles Coody , the 1971 champion , said Friday . At 68 , he had just shot a second-round 74 and announced it was his last at the Masters . <p> " I think people enjoy seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think it 's one of the things that makes the tournament unique . Of course everyone wishes that Arnie and Jack would play forever because people will always want to see them , but you ca n't say that Arnie and Jack can always play but the other guys ca n't . " He smiled . " I 'd like to be one of those old guys someday . " <p> Love has finished second here twice  --  in 1995 to Ben Crenshaw ; in 1999 to Olazabal . Because he is a major champion  --  he won the 1997 PGA Championship  --  he will always have the right to come here and take part in the pre-tournament festivities even if he never wins the Masters . <p> " I might do it once or twice , " he said . " But I do n't think I 'd do it on a regular basis . It would be too hard to be here and not play . Of course I 'm hoping it wo n't come to that . " <p> Love started Saturday at 145  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 on Thursday and ca n't help but think about friends who are n't here this year : Strange , Norman , Jeff Sluman , Lee Janzen , Paul Azinger , Hal Sutton . All are major champions who could be here taking part in the nontournament activities . The only one who put in an appearance was Sutton , who received an award here Wednesday night for his work in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina . <p> " It 's just too tough , " said Sluman , who played here 16 times and finished tied for fourth in 1992 . " I remember one year I missed the cut and hung around for the weekend because I 'd invited friends down to watch the tournament . I was miserable . I stood near the first tee and watched the guys go off and felt like the little kid who was n't picked to play in a ballgame . I just wanted to go home . " <p> Many players who are n't eligible will schedule vacations out of the country during Masters week so they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't turn the on the television because seeing shots of the holes they once played is too difficult . When Phil Mickelson finally won his first major title here in 2004 , his first comment was about being able to come back to Augusta for the rest of his life . <p> " It 's great knowing no matter what happens to me in golf , I 'll be able to come back here and play every year , " he said . " It 's almost a relief . " <p> One of the other perks of victory is getting to move upstairs to the champions locker room , which is off-limits to everyone else  --  including the media . When David Duval , who has also finished second here twice , finished playing Friday , he was n't really in the mood to talk about his rounds of 84-75 , even if he did shoot 32 on the back nine Friday . When Duval came out of the scorer 's tent and declined to talk , several reporters followed him back into the locker room , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It has n't happened often , but there have been rare occasions in recent years when Tiger Woods has played poorly enough that he has n't wanted to talk to the media . The difference between Woods and Duval is that Woods can go straight to the champions locker room and not have to worry about anyone following him . <p> Several years ago , after Norman had shot a 77 on Saturday to remove himself from contention , he patiently answered questions under the famous Augusta tree and then headed into the locker room . A writer from a non-sports magazine trailed Norman into the locker room . He introduced himself to Norman and said he wanted to sit down with Norman and talk in detail about his life on tour . <p> " Now ? " Norman said incredulously . " Now ? Do you know what I shot today ? " <p> The writer slinked away , no doubt to go check on Norman 's score . Norman looked at several players and shook his head in disbelief . <p> " Boy , do I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , forcing a smile . <p> He never got there . And now , like many others , he 's no longer here at all .
