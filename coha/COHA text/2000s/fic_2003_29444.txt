FRANCE NATIONALE CHARLES DE GAULLE 2 A 421 FRANCE For the third time tonight , Daisy Lewis steers her car along Church Street . The crowd lined up for the Harvard Square Movie Theater snakes into her lane . A shredded-blue-jeaned couple stops in the middle of the street , gesturing wildly . They both sport ponytails . Silver hoops thread through at least three of their ears . Daisy sighs . It 's so hard to tell anything these days , to sort people , sexes , even beliefs . She feels like plowing them down , this pair who are now hugging on the yellow line like some permanently inserted traffic cone . She honks her horn ; they do n't move . Pedestrians seem to be reproducing at the same rate as Mildred and Stanley , the guppies Sammy had when he was five . Taking over the Square like the infestation of lice that once ran rampant through the first grade . Her Square , she thinks . " My life , " she says . Daisy checks the doorway of the Unitarian church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounded under a pile of what must have once been quilts of many colors but have all aged into an indeterminate gray . Age and change , the two enemies she 's sleeping with . And Henry , she adds , though lately there has n't been a whole lot of that . She pulls into the spot marked for clergy only and tries to tamp down her guilt . Will God get her for taking the place of a man of the cloth ? She is , after all , the half-Jewish daughter of a bacon-addicted mother and an atheist father whose last visit to a house of God was at his own christening in the one-room schoolhouse-cum-church in Benkelman , Nebraska . Besides , she believes in theseparation of Church and State . How can you have a parking space designated For Clergy Only and not for a forty-two-year-old North Cambridge ex-food bank organizer now community relations manager slash ombudsman for the Star Market chain ? She looks at her watch . What 's more , no clergy would want her to be late for the awards ceremony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good works . She hurries toward Brattle Street , hobbled by the unaccustomed high heels and her new tapered skirt . These days , since she sometimes freelances from home and since her office next to the meat freezer requires her to dress less for success than to pad herself for warmth , she is not the fashion plate she might choose to be . She will , of course , be late . Henry is coming from French class , five minutes across the Yard , five minutes more to the Loeb . She hopes he 's not wearing that ridiculous beret he affects on Extension School nights . But that 's not her worry , she reminds herself . What Henry wears , says , or looks like does not reflect on her . She wishes she believed that . She passes the Yin and Yang Restaurant and breathes in the smells of soy and sesame oil . As usual , the dining room , except for a clueless tourist , is empty . Twenty-five years ago , she had eaten chop suey in one of these tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her roommate had ended up in the infirmary . There , their fluids were replenished by Cokes laced with sugar to get out the bubbles , their underarms packed in ice to bring down the fevers of food poisoning . By now , Henry will have started on the white wine and food-from-many-nations , each platter crested with a paper-flagged toothpick denoting country of origin . She pictures him talking up a sultry beauty in Kente cloth or a vision of health in dirndl and clogs . He will have already leapfrogged over the group of Japanese business students , a navy-suited mass of male solidarity . He will skirt the Latin American Kennedy students , men , older than the others , sent to Cambridge by their governments . She should have walked . " Why did n't you walk ? " Henry would ask with a nod at her hips . " Beautiful night . We all can use the exercise . " Daisy pulls in her stomach . It 's not that she 's fat . But something happened when she turned forty . Along with the cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought it was funnyto Modern Maturity , she also found herself the recipient of pounds that frosted themselves onto her hips , her knees , unnipped her once nipped-in waist , cushioned her once chiseled chin . She 'd always been pretty : Miss Latin Club in seventh grade , Miss Stonehouse Road Junior High first semester in eighth . She still was , in a forty-two-year-old way . Daisy pats her hips , the mounds that have n't seemed to dislodge despite the five free aerobics classes she 'd been enticed into from a flyer tucked under her windshield wiper . " I 'm not sure this is for me , " she told Heidi , whose purple spandex circled a thigh the width of Daisy 's wrist . Heidi lowered her eyes to Daisy 's problem area . " You 'll live to regret this , " she warned . Now Daisy pushes open the heavy glass doors of the Loeb Theater and thinks that there are many things she has probably lived to regret : that she has only one child , that that child is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of extra-long sheets that will probably never be washed and changed , let alone washed and changed by a mother 's loving hands . She remembers her great-uncle Herbert , whose parents emigrated to Cambridge for the four years he was at Harvard and re-created in their rental an exact replica of Herbert 's childhood room down to the green-shaded desk lamp and the doily snowflaked across the maple bureau top . She can identify . She pictures Sammy one mile away in Pennypacker Hall . They moved him in two weeks ago . Since then , they 've heard very little . She 's taken to hanging out in the Squareat the Coop where at some point he has to line up to buy four syllabi 's worth of books , at the sandwich shops and pizza joints where she 's run into scores of his old high school chums . " Oh , Mrs. Lewis , " they 'll say , " I 've just bumped into Sammy at the Kiosk . " Or , " Hi , Mrs. Lewis , Sammy was in front of me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander to the bank or the magazine stand , where sightings of Elvis seemed more likely occurrences than sightings of her here-on-earth and geographically proximate son . He might as well be at Stanford , where he would have been if he 'd gotten in . " So count Harvard as your safety , " Henry had said . " And be tainted as a legacy ? " Sammy was indignant , vowing until the last moment to seek the egalitarianism of UMass . Daisy looks around her . The lobby of the Loeb is thronged with a United Nations worth of costumes and multicultural faces . There are saris from India and sweaters from Vogue , pleats from Talbots and plaids from the Highlands , ripped jeans from Camden Lock and pressed jeans from Place de la Concorde . Daisy lingers at the edge of the crowd , searching for Henry , but before she can find him , Elizabeth Malcolm , the head of the Harvard International Office , spots her and hurries over with the businesslike tat-a-tat of her sensible pumps . " Oh , Daisy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Daisy had had rotator cuff problems she 'd be scheduled for surgery . " I 've been waiting for you . I thought we 'd have the ceremony before everybody gets too tipsy hanging out at the bar . " Daisy looks toward the bar , where three young men in elbow-patched tweed and mufflers with stripes of three different universities she ca n't identify are talking quietly . What seems like a stingy supply of half-gallons of generic reds and whites lines a folding table covered by a paper cloth . Two trays carry plastic cups the size of shot glasses . Cocktail napkins with Veritases on them are shaped to form an H and a U. It would probably take a trayful of glasses even to begin to get tipsy , Daisy decides . She wonders if UMass with its lack of endowments might have a less Puritan , less miserly approach to celebration . " Have you seen Henry ? " Daisy asks Elizabeth , who is writing Daisy Lewis Host Family Honoree on a Hello , I 'm . . . sticker . " Over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table laden with foil lasagna pans , each boasting , as she 'd predicted , a flag signifying country of casserole . " He found the French contingent immediately . He 's doing so well , has made such strides with the language " she giggles " that I could n't resist putting Henri on his name tag . " " I 'm sure he 's thrilled , " Daisy says . " Not that I 'd really know , " Elizabeth goes on , " even though I had three years at Winsor . My ear . " She points to her lobe , on which is clipped a pearl the size of a ladybug . " Besides , in college , Spanish was considered more important for social work . " Daisy is about to ask whether heading up the office for international students at Harvard can be even loosely interpreted as social work , but thinks better of it . She notices a Chinese woman sitting in a corner looking both bewildered and sad . Elizabeth notices too . " Let me rescue Wang Ling , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth puts her hand on the Chinese woman 's shoulder and nods energetically . Daisy looks back over to Henryor , rather , Henri . The French contingent must consist only of women , since the ring-a-rosy around Henry is entire female . She is relieved to see he is not wearing the beret , though she detects an inch of blue wool peeking out from his breast pocket . Even at this distance she recognizes the smug turn of his mouth and his index finger raised to its most pontifical . She waves in his direction , but Henry , so intent on conversation , does n't notice her . She 's sure he 's speaking French from the way his lips are pursed in the exact position high school teachers instruct you to use when making the French u . He looks like he 's sucking lemons . But though his face is vastly disapproving , his hands loop through the air as if he 's spinning worlds of sugar plums in front of the uplifted faces of his adoring audience . A waterfall of charm , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on like a garden hose . Daisy is about to make her way toward him when Elizabeth Malcolm , one hand pulling the Chinese girl , grabs her elbow and leads her over to the microphone . " Will Henry Lewis come over here , " she announces in a burst of static that accelerates into a high-pitched hum . In seconds , Henry is at Daisy 's side , smiling like an ad for Colgate . She smells something suspiciously like Old Spice , though she assumes that whatever it is comes in a bottle reading made in France and costs three times as much . " You 're late , " he whispers through the pearly whites . " Parking , " Daisy says . " You should have walked . " His hand , which he 's placed at the small of her back , moves a little lower , where he does the pincer test for fat . Up close she notices that his beret is arranged with the kind of care waiters use to fan a napkin across a serving plate on the tables of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , " she hisses under her breath . In spite of the beret and the Henri name tag stuck to his lapel , it delights her to realize that his straight and healthy teeth are a blatant giveaway of made-in-America orthodontia , a comforting world of retainers and rubber bands , of tumblers of milk and bowls of vitamin-enriched cornflakes . Not a nation of muddy coffee , filthy Gauloises , red wine rubbed on the gums of infants in their bassinets . " Students and their host families , may I have your attention , please ? " announces Elizabeth Malcolm . She is enunciating carefully with pauses between words for those for whom English is not a second language but maybe a third or sixth . The room quiets down . All multinationed faces are raised toward Daisy and Henry Lewis , who stand shoulder to shoulder , their big American smiles a testament to their even larger , more bountiful , more all-encompassing big American hearts . " Darling , " Henry says . " Honey , " Daisy says . Elizabeth Malcolm claps her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis , dedicated host family for twenty years . " There is a round of polite applause . " Here , here , " say the British guys over at the bar in the voices of bored MPs during those sessions of Parliament you sometimes see screened on C-SPAN . Elizabeth Malcolm clears her throat . She pulls the microphone out of its socket . She 's the spitting image of a talk-show host about to wander out into the audience . " Twenty years ago , " she begins , " as students themselves , they hosted their first international student . And every year , another one . And now their son is a freshman at the college , almost the age of many of you here . " Elizabeth stops , an ear cocked for a chorus of Wows ! Though none are forthcoming , she is not at all deflated but proceeds with even more enthusiasm . " They are an exemplary family , " she says . " A Harvard family , " she emphasizes . " An American family . " She holds the microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of shifting relationships , " Elizabeth goes on , " alternative lifestyles , they are the rock of stability , the very model of a model family . " She reaches behind her and whips forward a folder of padded crimson leatherette embossed with a Harvard seal , a replica of Daisy 's and Henry 's old diplomas , now tucked away in an attic cabinet . " So without further ado . . . " Next to Daisy , Henry shifts , fidgets with his sleeve . To his credit , he looks as uncomfortable as Daisy feels . Or maybe it 's just disappointment that he 's not singled out as the model of a model French family . Though the award is for the two of them , joint property for joint hosts , Henry takes it . Daisy stretches up on tiptoes to read over Henry 's shoulder : To Daisy and Henry Lewis , Host Family In Grateful Appreciation for Many Years of Welcoming Harvard University International Students With Generous Hospitality and Caring Friendship " A few words . " Elizabeth twirls the microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . " Thank you very much , " says Henry . " Quite an honor . " His head bobbles over clusters of countries lined up like contiguous states until it alights on France . " Merci bien , " he adds with a slight Gallic-looking salute . " Merci trs bien . " " Daisy ? " Elizabeth asks . Daisy shakes her head . Undaunted , Elizabeth slides the microphone under Henry 's chin . " You two , tell us about your first host-family experience , " she gushes . Henry turns to Daisy . " Dear , " he says in his most unctuous , for-the-public-tone , " ladies first . " " Pilombaya , " Daisy says . And it comes to her without any thought . As if it 's been poised all these years on the springboard of her tongue , waiting only for the gun to go off . " Pilombaya , " she says again .
