Twenty-five-year-old Kayce Casner and her younger sister Karri were travel buddies and best friends . Then Karri was brutally murdered in a terrorist attack ... and Kayce had to search for her body . // When Karri , my younger sister , decided to come to Thailand with me and my boyfriend , Clark , last fall , I was thrilled . She had just graduated from the University of Colorado and was trying to figure out her next step in life . I was scheduled to be in Cambodia by mid-October for a two-month project to study crocodiles for Conservation International . Clark was coming along , and we had decided to do some exploring beforehand in other parts of Southeast Asia . To be honest , I was looking forward to getting out of the United States for a while . Ever since 9/11 , terrorism has become a horrific reality in America . But I never imagined that it would follow us around the globe . from rivals to best friends Karri and I were only 18 months apart-I 'm 25 and she was 23-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up in Irving , Texas , and were very different as kids . Karri was a tomboy , while I wore bows in my hair . By high school , we had moved to a Dallas suburb , and our roles began reversing . Karri became more feminine , and I discovered sports . We did not get along well and were competitive-it always irked me that she would want to hang out with my friends and worse , that they inevitably liked her . But all that changed in college , when we became best friends . I transferred from the University of Oklahoma , which I did n't like , to the University of Colorado , where Karri was a freshman . We were still different-she joined a sorority and I joined the triathlon team-but we went out together all the time and also became running partners . I decided to major in environmental biology , and in the fall of 1998 , I went on Semester at Sea , a program in which you study on a ship while touring parts of the world . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same program , even though she was a business major . Although we both loved to travel , going to Thailand would be our first big trip together . On September 25 , 2002 , we flew to Bangkok and went straight to Koh Tao , an island famous for scuba diving . From the moment we arrived , Karri said that she wanted to extend her two-week trip-she was having the best time hanging out on beautiful beaches and meeting travelers from all over the world . I invited her to come to Cambodia , but she had met several people who were heading to Bali-an island in Indonesia and popular backpackers ' destination-which inspired her to follow suit . Still , Clark and I were a bit surprised when she announced she wanted to go alone . Karri was confident , but she clearly had some reservations . She asked Clark , who has traveled on his own , a million questions , like " What do you do when you get off the plane ? " and " Where do you meet people ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month and then buying an airplane ticket to Bali . Her plan was to start in Kuta , Bali 's most popular beach town , before exploring the rest of the island . She would then return to Thailand before heading back to Texas , where she thought she might start a career in pharmaceutical sales . She left Thailand on October 10 , the day before my birthday . She had wanted to stay and celebrate with me but could n't get the right flights . On the 11th , I received an E-mail from her saying that traveling alone was 10 times better than she had ever expected . She had met some Australians in Kuta and spent the day on a gorgeous beach . That afternoon , Clark and I took a bus to the Cambodian border town of Koh Kong . We planned to stay there several days before traveling three hours by car to the field station where I would be conducting my research . On October 12 , we hiked to a waterfall and bought supplies for our two-month stint . But then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed in a club in Bali . I was bathing with a bucket of water at the house where we were staying when he ran to tell me . I assumed that Karri was okay , but I was worried that she was all by herself and scared . Since I was stranded in rural Cambodia with a satellite phone that only worked 1 in 10 times , Clark and I went to Conservation International 's office so we could watch the BBC ( the British news station ) . The program kept flashing an awful picture of a pile of smoking rubble that was once the Sari Club . When I heard it was Bali 's hot nightspot , I grew worried : If there was a party somewhere , Karri would be in the middle of it . Still , I never thought for a minute that she was dead-I thought , if anything , she was in the midst of the mayhem pulling other people from the rubble . the search begins I immediately packed my bags to leave for Bangkok , where we could catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border between Cambodia and Thailand had closed for the evening , so we had to stay put . That night was the longest of my life . The next morning , we paid someone to take us to Bangkok . The drive usually takes five hours ; we made it in three and a half , but every minute felt like an eternity . In the car , I was joking that once I found Karri , I was going to make her pay me back for the cab fare . When we arrived in Bangkok , I was able to get through to my parents , who were in Hawaii on a layover en route to Bali . They told me that when Karri had n't called , they had become worried-she had called home everyday from Thailand-and decided they had to go find her . Before I left Bangkok , I went to an Internet cafe and checked Karri 's E-mail account to see if she had sent any messages since the bombing . She had n't , but there were many messages for her . One was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bombing after having dinner with her and his friends . He wrote , " Karri , we 're really worried about you . We know you were going to the Sari Club after dinner . Write us back as soon as possible . " My heart sank when I realized that meant that she had almost definitely been at the Sari Club that night . I responded , explaining that I was her sister and asking if he could tell me anything that would help me find her . By the next day , Clark and I and my parents had all landed in Bali . Kuta is 20 miles from the airport , and I had imagined that I would literally be digging through debris searching for Karri . But by the time we got there , the area had been cordoned off and all the bodies had been retrieved and placed in body bags that filled the hospitals . My parents had arrived before we did and already looked through some photographs of the deceased , which were posted in the hospitals , but none of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman was being flown to Australia for medical treatment , so we held out hope that the young woman was her . That night , we found out the woman was n't Karri , so we started to assume she might be among the unidentifiable dead . My mom called our dentist in Texas , who E-mailed Karri 's dental records to us at the hotel , and we pulled hair from her brush for DNA testing . The U.S. consulate told us it could take up to four months to find her body . This was hard news , as none of us wanted to leave Bali without Karri , dead or alive . My mother kept saying , " What if we never , ever find her ? " piecing it all together The next day , Clark and I went to Karri 's hotel , which was two blocks from the club . Oddly enough , her room 's window was the only one in the whole hotel that had been shattered by the blast . My dad had been there earlier and found her travel journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm so scared to be doing this-I felt like crying when I left Clark and Kayee behind . " I hated the thought of her being afraid , but then in the next entry , she wrote about a crush she had on this " cute Aussie " whom she had met her first night in Bali and who had asked her to meet him at the Sari Club on October 12 . Meanwhile , I received an E-mail response from the other Australian with an exact description of what Karri had had on the night of the bombing-a green tank top , blue jeans , and an oversize turquoise ring she 'd bought that morning . We gave the description to the hospital , and within a couple of hours , we got a call saying that one of the caseworkers remembered seeing the ring . At that point , I lost it . I became so upset that I could n't even stand up . The little piece of hope I 'd been clinging to for those few brutal days disappeared as the cold hard reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . My dad rushed to the hospital , but the caseworker had left and no one could find Karri 's file . It took two hours just to figure out which body bag Karri was in . Once they found it , a friend of my father 's who had come to Bali with him for support went to identify her . No one in our family could face the gruesome task , especially considering we had no idea what state she 'd be in . But he said it looked as if she had died instantaneously , that there were no burns , and that she was beautiful . So one second , she was having the time of her life talking to some Australian boy , and the next second , she was gone . I took small comfort in the fact that at least she felt no pain or fear . Karri was cremated in Bali the next day , and my parents brought her ashes with them back to Texas . Clark and I flow back as well , having E-mailed Conservation International to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following week , we had a memorial service and more than 300 people came . Karri was special to many people , but I feel her loss in a particularly profound way . She was my biggest cheerleader-figuratively and literally . When I ran my first marathon last year , she ran the final leg with me to get me over the finish line . When I got back to Texas after leaving Bali , I went on a run and I swear she was there . I could feel the leaves shuffle behind me , like she wanted me to know she 's still looking out for me. the aftermath of a tragedy About a month after the bombing , Balinese officials arrested Imam Samudra , a 35-year-old man with al Qaeda connections , whom they believe masterminded the attack , which wound up killing more than 190 people , including my sister . Everyonce in a while , I get mad and think that if he had just met Karri once , he never would have done this . But there 's too much anger in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of that . Of course , I 've thought a million times , Why did n't I make Karri stay another day in Thailand ? Or come with me to Cambodia ? I have moments of guilt , but I fight them . I do n't want to torture myself in that way . I still cry whenever I think about Karri being gone , but I 'd rather focus on the good things she taught me . She was endlessly hopeful and lived every day to its fullest . At the memorial service , I read an anonymous Native American poem that a friend had given me , which sums up my feelings about Karri . It begins , " Do not stand at my grave and weep . I am not there , I do not sleep . I am the thousand winds that blow . I am the diamond glint in the snow .

But the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss to recover from . " Losing a sibling , especially when you are young , is skin to having a limb ripped off , " says Pleasant Gill White , Ph.D. , a psychologist in Saint Louis . Here are three major hurdles that often arise : * Much of one 's identity is developed through sibling relationships-one child is always the youngest , the other deemed the most academic , etc. - so when a brother or sister dies , that identity is disrupted . " Sometimes the remaining sibling tries to take on the role of the dead sibling , " adds White . * They 're often haunted by the thought that they could have somehow prevented the death , which can have long-term complications . " Because of their guilt , they often feel like they have to be punished , they may fall into difficult relationships or alcohol and drug abuse , " notes White . * Finally , grieving siblings become much more fearful of their mortality and the circumstances surrounding the sibling 's death .
