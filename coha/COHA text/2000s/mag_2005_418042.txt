THE TRIP Headnote The Long Trail offers steep climbs and solitude-and a whiff of border intrigue . // FOR A HIKER UNINITIATED to the Long Trail 's rigors , the climb up the backside of 3,858-foot Jay Peak is an hour-long baptism of fire : nearly 1,700 feet up in under 2 miles . It 's as if the Yankee adventurers who blazed this stretch of trail were selling the Calvinist notion that hard work is a virtue . I do n't count myself among the converted , but at least the climb has me focused on hiking . Before we started this weekend-long trek 15 trail miles short of Canada , we 'd spent all our time discussing this loopy post-9/11 era we live in-and wondering how far in we 'd get before the Feds swooped in to search our sleeping bags or confiscate our bratwurst . But we make the summit without seeing another person , and all we can do is speculate , between gasps , about how these trailblazers could have been so oblivious to the notion of gentle switchbacks . My brother Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northernmost section of the Long Trail-a 272-miler that begins on Vermont 's southern border and yo-yos over more than 40 Green Mountain peaks ( including 4,393-foot Mount Mansfield , the state 's highest ) before ending on Canada 's border-with more on our minds than hiking . We 're here because we 'd heard of fears that the drug smugglers once rumored to ply this trail have been replaced by dirty-bomb-carrying terrorists-and by the body-armored border-patrol teams fanning out to find them . No one 's ever paid much attention to this patchwork of ski hills , farms , and tiny towns . After all , there are 800 miles of open border in New England , and only three interstate crossings . But after 9/11 , and Iraq , and the look-under-every-rock paranoia that followed , this dense , piney wilderness apparently-to Tom Ridge and his ilk-resembled a gaping hole in the homeland 's perimeter . When 80-year-old thru-hiker Bob Northrup recently held a party at trail 's end to celebrate his seventh finish , a border-patrol chopper buzzed the group to make sure nobody was up to any funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by agents . Even folksy Yankee magazine published a piece in which an official reminisced about the relative innocence of the days when they only worried about a few ragged cigarette and dope runners . " Now , " he told the magazine , " we 're looking for terrorists . " My brother Jim and I figured we 'd check it out . We grew up in El Paso , TX , across the Rio Grande from Jurez , Mexico , so we know border tensions . But the unrelenting climb yielded little fodder for the Homeland Security hotline . The view is huge : We can see the Adirondacks in the southwest and the White Mountains to the southeast , but except for a few carpets of green dairy pasture , much of the terrain is buried under conifers and hardwoods down the spine of the Greens to 4,083-foot Camel 's Hump and beyond . To the north is big-sky Canada , and an isolated wilderness that makes Vermont 's rural villages seem almost cosmopolitan-and makes us realize how utterly indefensible this border really is . We 're wrapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles , and over the horizon comes a scraggly college student with barely an ounce of body fat . He goes by the trail name Master Splinter , and he 's one of the 150 people who bag the whole trail annually . Blazed between 1910 and 1930 , the Long Trail inspired the creation of its famous cousin , the Appalachian , and the two merge for 100 miles . The Splinter tells us he 's doing 15 miles a day , which is clearly faster than we 're moving . But he insists he wants to walk with us to the Laura Woodward Shelter , tonight 's destination . He has n't seen any obvious terror candidates , the Splinter reports as we chug down Jay Peak 's grassy slopes and back under the canopy . If he does further on , we 'll never know . After a chilly late-summer night at the shelter-where the kid inhales one of our cold bratwursts in three bites-he slathers his last ration of peanut butter on a Clif bar , and clicks off down the trail . Maybe we should 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common knowledge that the path has long had its share of nonrecreational users . During the War of 1812 , profiteers used an early , primitive version of the trail to smuggle in embargoed British goods . In the 1920s and early ' 30s , bootleggers purportedly used it to keep the States wet through Prohibition . Today , border agents will tell you that a few area families are still smuggling after 80 years , though now the contraband is more likely to be $3,000-a-pound hydroponic marijuana called Quebec Gold , or illegal aliens-usually from Asia , Africa , and Eastern Europe-searching for opportunity . Last year , a University of Vermont student was busted selling Canadian " hydro " out of his dorm-and later confessed to carrying it in on the Long Trail , inspiring some to rename the path " The Bong Trail . " The border here has always had a sort of quirky charm . In several places , a road starts in the U.S. , pokes into Canada , and ducks back into the States . The border runs right through the town of Derby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the shelter , the path again pushes straight uphill , covering a fast 600 vertical feet up 3,409-foot Doll Peak . We break through the thick woods near the summit , and from a west-facing outcrop a half-mile farther on , we again drop the packs in front of the empty expanse . There may be treachery afoot somewhere , but for now our only whiff of intrigue comes from the trail itself . The Long Trail Guide warns that the path from Doll involves " a steady and sometimes steep descent . " This is a near-criminal understatement . Not only is it precipitous , but the six or so inches of topsoil on the trail have washed away to reveal a slippery slate bedrock channel . Unlike the indomitable Master Splinter , we are n't outfitted with handy poles , and we both take a few pinwheeling tumbles onto our packs . We heard that this is the third wettest year in state history , and my mud-shellacked shoes are proof . " This is like hiking down a river , " Jim says , hauling himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , must already be in the mind-altering grip of their contraband-or seriously fit , or owners of the world 's grippiest shoes . Or all of the above . We pick our way for 3.4 miles to the Shooting Star Shelter , where we eat the remaining bratwurst and discuss the literal allure of the shelter 's name , given that pine houghs obscure the sky almost everywhere else . It 's pretty in here , and quiet-the sort of place that draws people into the woods . If I already saw cracks in the notion that the LT deserves Code-Orange vigilance , Brian DeBrita opened them into a full-blown crevasse . DeBrita , a muscular 35-year-old , is a 9-year border-patrol veteran and member of the elite Border Patrol National Tactical Team ( BORTAC ) , which tracks terrorists and intercepts smuggling operations , among other duties . His station patrols 16 miles of wilderness border , including this stretch of trail . We 'd arranged a meeting at the VT 105 crossing . As we hike north , DeBrita , who sports a pistol , telescoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills-like determining the age of a shoeprint , and whether a person was running or walking-that he honed " down South . " All agents start out along the Mexican border , and for 7 years DeBrita patrolled the El Paso Sector , which has miles of chain-link-fenced border and unmanned surveillance blimps . When he learns we grew up in El Paso , he looks shocked . " It 's a different world down there , " the Vermont native says . " I 'm sure there was a day I did n't have at least one apprehension , but I ca n't remember it . " Here on the trail ? He waves dismissively . In a 12-month period ending in October 2004 , agents arrested 2,701 illegal aliens and seized 5,661 pounds of pot-but that was along a 300-mile span of border between New York and the Maine-New Hampshire line , and almost entirely at road crossings . " You just ca n't carry that much on this kind of hike , " DeBrita says . By late afternoon , we poke out of the forest at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty modest : Just a small metal obelisk and a swath cleared of brush mark the border-although there is reportedly some form of electronic detection in place . The wilds of Quebec loom invitingly in front of us . DeBrita scans the emptiness , eventually fixing his gaze on what looks like an abandoned tractor-trailer abutting the border in the valley below . As he takes mental notes , we sit by the obelisk and conclude that the Long Trail experience has n't changed much , complex geopolitics notwithstanding . It 's still a hiker 's dream : a chance to pound your glutes into submission amid classic Green Mountain scenery and solitude . And it 's mostly protected by the same rugged terrain that makes it a great place to hike . If you go , bring extra bratwurst . Not because your food could get confiscated , but because The Splinter might try for a repeat-and bring his friends . ( THE TRIP ) PLAN IT The Hike To hike the entire Long Trail the usual way-south to north-pick up the AT where it intersects with MA 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From there it 's a 4-mile uphill hike to the Vermont border and the Long Trail 's southern terminus . Thruhikers typically complete the 272-mile path in 26 to 30 days , averaging 8-10 miles per . It 's a modest pace by long-trail standards , but that 's a by-product of the steep , rocky relief .
