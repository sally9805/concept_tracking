The Saint of Dragons Chapter One Simon St. George It was autumn . October . It was the edge of a wicked season , and Christmas was a far-off thought . The amber-crimson colors of fall , and its pumpkin-spice smells , surrounded Simon St. George like a vast , bewitching fire . There had never been an October that felt so perfectly suited to Halloween . There was a chill in the air that was worse than normal for this time of year , and a fog hung around the Bay , and the houses in the Bay , with a cruel persistence . The trees seemed to hunch over in sadness and wish for their leaves back to keep them warm . All the pumpkins in Ebony Hollow 's fields seemed rotten , and to ache from their own rottenness . The factory smoke from over the hill swept down into town , and the gray daylight seemed to give way after only a few hours to a deep , intense nightfall . No one wanted to be out much . And no one could sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . The idea that something was n't quite right just skittered over his mind between thoughts of tomorrow 's Halloween masquerade and a girl in town whose name he did not know . For him , Halloween was more than just fun and games . The masquerade was something everyone had to go to at his school , a tradition , and everyone had to be in costume . Simon was n't sure why he needed a costume ; he seemed to disappear in a crowd easily enough without one . No matter what he did , no one seemed to notice him or take him very seriously . He was an average kid , a bit smallish , which made him easy to ignore . He had an upturned pug-nose , and blond , wiry , slept-in hair that made him look even younger . But he often kept his head down , so you never got a really good look at him ; to the other boys , if they thought of him at all , he was something of a mystery . Simon went to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it was just for boys and it was made from a giant old lighthouse . It was a boarding school , where children slept and ate and lived , at least for most of the year . It was perfect if your parents wanted you to be strong and independent , or if they did n't have time for you . Simon St. George had parents who did n't have time for him . They paid for his school , but he did n't know who they were , had n't seen them since he was two years old , and he did n't like to talk about it , if it was all the same to you . At this moment , it was hard to see the Lighthouse School . There was just its shining light , laboring to cut through the mist . On most days the Lighthouse School could be seen from almost anywhere in town , because it was on a high promontory cliff and it was huge . In this same way , the school had dominated Simon 's life . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner of the misty street and stared at the little novelty shop on the opposite corner . He could just make out the shop window filled with strange , hand-painted masks , and the daughter of the shop owner at the counter . Simon had hardly ever said a word to her , but she kept his secret , that he liked to collect toys and marbles , because her shop was where he bought them . He was thirteen . She was maybe two years older . Simon watched the girl adjust the masks hanging in the window . He gathered up his nerve and stepped off to cross the street . As he did , the foghorn bellowed at the edge of the bay with a low moan . And something else happened . Simon turned to look for traffic , and saw at the next corner , crossing the street going the other way , a very tall figure , hunched over as if from a deformity or sickness . He wore a long trench coat with the collar pulled up tight around his neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face could be seen . It was just a quick moment , but as Simon looked , the wind picked up and blew the man 's coat open . Although the man quickly tightened it around him , Simon could swear he saw a clawlike foot and a thick tail slapping the ground , a tail like the largest snake on earth . It was hard for Simon to get a good look through the fog . The man was no more than a shadowy profile . In the next second , the figure had moved on , around a corner , and could n't be seen , and the idea that some sort of creature was roaming the streets of Ebony Hollow was too ridiculous to investigate . So Simon caught his breath and went inside the novelty shop , feeling around in his pocket for money and feeling around in his head for something to say to the girl behind the counter . He stood at the doorway and managed to catch her gaze for about a second , and that was it . His eyes scanned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of metal , a kind Simon collected . He did n't know why he liked them , but he did . No one else his age ever wanted these . He bought a little black knight and a Halloween mask that matched it , and he was just starting to talk to the girl about the masquerade when he was interrupted . With a bang the shop door opened , and a group of boys from his school herded in , noisily , arrogantly pushing Simon aside as they argued over costumes . The girl almost instantly forgot about him , and after trying to be heard over their voices , Simon left the boys and the shop behind . Today just was n't his day .
