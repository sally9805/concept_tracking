The rainstorm was blinding , and Sally was way behind schedule . She had n't intended to be late , fashionably or otherwise . She just was n't good with directions , and this was n't exactly her neck of the woods . Sheets of water pelted the windshield , sounding like marbles bouncing off glass . She adjusted the wipers , but they were already working at full speed . She could n't remember rain like this in years , not since she and her first husband lost their restaurant to that no-name tropical storm . Orange taillights flashed ahead . A stream of cars was inching down the highway at the speed of cooling lava . She slowed to somewhere below the school-zone limit , then checked her watch . Eleven twenty-five . Damn . He 'd just have to wait . She 'd get there , eventually . Their meeting had been arranged by telephone . They 'd spoken only once , and his instructions were simple enough . Thursday , 11 P.M. Do n't be late . She did n't dare reschedule , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sure of it . Just ahead , a neon sign blinked erratically , as if shaken by the storm . It was like trying to read an eye chart at the bottom of a lake , and she could only make out part of it : **40;0;TOOLONG . " Sparky 's , " she readaloud . This was the place . She steered off the highway and pulled into the flooded parking lot . Under all this water , she could only guess as to the exact location of the parking spot . She killed the engine and checked her face in the rearview mirror . Lightning flashed - a close one . It lit up the inside of her car and unleashed a crack of thunder that sent shivers down her spine . It frightened her , then triggered a bemused smile . How ironic would that have been ? After all this planning , to get hit by lightning . She took a deep breath and exhaled . No turning back now . Just go for it . She jumped down from the car and started her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost immediately a blast of wind snatched her umbrella from her hand and pitched it somewhere into the next county . Wearing no coat , she covered her head with her hands and just kept running , splashing with each footfall . In a matter of seconds she reached the door , soaked to her undergarments , her wet jeans and white blouse pasted to her body . A muscle-bound guy wearing a Gold 's Gym T-shirt was standing at the entrance , and he opened the door for her . " Wet T-shirt contest 's not till tomorrow , lady . " " You wish , " she said , then headed straight to the restroom to see if she could dry off . She looked in the mirror and gasped . Her nipples were staring back at her , right through her bra and wet blouse . Good God ! She punched the hand dryer , hoping for hot air . Nothing . She tried again , and again , but to no avail . She reached for a paper towel , but the dispenser was empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stall , found a loose roll atop the tank , and proceeded to dab furiously from head to foot . It was single-ply paper , not terribly absorbent . She went through the entire roll . She exited the stall , took another look at her reflection in the mirror , and gasped even louder this time . Her entire body was covered with shredded remnants of cheap toilet paper . You look like a milkweed . She started laughing , not sure why . She laughed so hard it almost hurt . Then , with her hands braced on the edge of the sink , she leaned forward and hung her head . She could feel her emotional energy drifting up to that ever-present knot of tension at the base of her skull . Her shoulders started to heave , and the laughter turned to tears . She fought it off and quickly regained her composure . " You are a total wreck , " she said to her reflection . She brushed off as much of the toilet paper as she could , fixed her makeup , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop this meeting from happening . She took a deep breath for courage and exited into the bar . The crowd surprised her , not so much its makeup , which was about what she 'd expected , but more the simple fact that there was such a big crowd on a nasty night like this . A group of truckers was playing black-jack by the jukebox . Leather-clad bikers and their bleached-blond girlfriends had a monopoly on the pool table , as if waiting out the storm . T-shirts , jeans , and flannel shirts seemed to be the dress code for a seat at the bar . These folks were hard-core , and this was clearly a place that depended on its regulars . " Can I help you , miss ? " the bartender asked . " Not just yet , thanks . I 'm looking for someone . " " Yeah ? Who ? " Sally hesitated , not exactly sure how to answer that . " Just , uh , sort of a blind date . " " That must be Jimmy , " said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sally smiled awkwardly , the inside joke completely lost on her . The bartender explained , " Jimmy 's the umpire in our softball league . They do n't come any blinder . " " Ah , I get it , " she said . They laughed again at this Jimmy 's expense . Sally broke away and continued across the bar before their interest could return to the lost girl in the wet clothes . Her gaze fixed on the third booth from the back , near the broken air-hockey table . A black guy with penetrating eyes and no smile was staring back at her . He was wearing a dark blue shirt with black pants , which made Sally smile to herself . Never before had she laid eyes on him , but his look and those clothes were exactly what he 'd described over the telephone . It was him ... ( Continues ... )
