<p> As a member of the districtwide student council her sophomore year , Monique Harrington , who is now a junior at the Philadelphia High School for Girls , stood before 300 classmates and sailed through the speech that she had prepared . <p> Remembering that day , she says , " It was nothing . These are my people . I can talk to them . " She did n't stumble later that summer either , when she addressed a room packed with professors . <p> " There are a number of miracle stories to tell , " says Leonard Sax , a psychologist and the director of the National Association for Single Sex Public Education ( NASSPE ) . And these stories , of confident young women like Monique , are being offered by advocates as a reason to continue expanding single-sex education into public schools and classrooms . <p> First there was Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 , the decision that outlawed racial segregation in America 's public schools . Then came Title IX in 1972 - the landmark law that declared discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both decisions affirmed a steady march toward integrated public schools in the United States . <p> In the past decade , however , single-sex schools have surged in popularity . Today , there are 25 same-sex public schools in the nation , almost all formed after 1996 , according to NASSPE . Another 72 schools offer single-sex classes . And a dozen more are slated to open in the fall . Some experts predict this trend will only continue , giving 2005 the potential to become a banner year for same-sex education . <p> Because of success stories like that of Girls High , and the desire to present parents with more education options for their children , in 2001 the Bush administration set out to make it easier to form such schools . <p> This March , the US Department of Education unveiled a proposal to change Title IX . Whereas in the past , only limited subjects like gym or sex education could be held in single-sex classrooms , under the new regulations , a school may create an all-girls physics class , for example , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys in a coeducational setting . <p> This also holds true for single-sex schools . To establish a boys ' school , a district must show only that equal offerings are available at a nearby coed school . A parallel girls ' school will no longer be required . <p> Reactions to the proposal have been mixed . Those opposed to tinkering with Title IX point out that what little research there is on single-sex public schools has been inconclusive , while civil rights groups fear the new plan could reverse 30 years of gains in gender equality . <p> Established in 1848 atop a hill overlooking row houses , Girls High is the second-oldest single-sex public school in the country . Each year , more than 3,000 students apply for fewer than 350 spots . <p> About 60 percent of the girls are African-American . Half come from families below the national poverty line . Yet upon graduating , about 96 percent of Girls High students continue on to college - many to prestigious schools . <p> It 's all part of a larger Girls High legacy . A history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for young people whose family life might be a bit disjointed or unconventional , " says Rosemary Salomone , author of " Same , Different , Equal : Rethinking Single-Sex Schooling " and a professor at St. John 's University School of Law in New York . <p> Many girls here insist that without the consuming distraction of boys , they are free to focus on school , and to develop their relationships with one another . They feel less competitive , more like a family . <p> " You do n't worry about your boyfriend - who he 's talking to , " says Monique . " You worry about that after school . " <p> Girls High students are also conscious of the value of their education , and they embrace the expectations that accompany it . " It would be a waste of time if you did n't go to college after going to Girls High , " explains sophomore Adikaira Martinez . <p> Studies have shown that teachers tend to call on boys more often than girls , and that girls , in turn , often fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls High , there is no such intimidation , they say . <p> Dr. Sax , director of NASSPE , says that Monique and her classmates are more comfortable in a same-sex environment due to biological differences between boys and girls that should not be ignored . <p> Research indicates that girls learn best in a friendly environment , says Sax . At the Young Women 's Leadership School in New York , an East Harlem public school founded in 1996 that last year sent 100 percent of its students to college , everyone - from the principal to the person who cleans the restroom - is on a first-name basis . <p> " Girls watch the teacher and then they do what the teacher does , " he says . <p> Not so in a boys ' setting , which Sax says requires a different approach altogether and works best when boys are addressed formally . Boys as young as the second grade thrive when a teacher demands : Mr. Jefferson , what 's your answer ? " If you teach them as men , they 're more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone agrees with this assessment . Kim Gandy , president of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) , believes that children may have distinct learning styles - one may learn by hearing , another by seeing , and a third by doing - but she takes exception at the notion that these differences break down strictly along gender lines . Gender is " not a monolith when it comes to learning style or ability , " says Ms. Gandy . <p> She worries that without the collegial relationships boys and girls form in school , they will not develop into men and women who understand and respect one another . <p> The American Civil Liberties Union shares NOW 's concern that the proposed changes to Title IX lack adequate safeguards and could lead down a " slippery slope " to sex discrimination . <p> Both groups argue that without better research on same-sex public education , Title IX should be left alone . <p> Even single-sex education advocates agree that the lack of conclusive research is a problem . <p> Ms. Salomone , the law professor , acknowledges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds that because these programs have been outside the legal bounds for 30 years , there has never been a field for conducting research . She says lower standards of evidence should be accepted , at least for the time being . <p> Cornelius Riordan , a professor of sociology at Providence College in Rhode Island , was recently commissioned by the Department of Education to examine research on single-sex education in both the public and private sectors in the US and other English-speaking countries , with a particular eye to how it may benefit at-risk students . <p> Studies that he conducted on Catholic schools in the ' 70s and ' 80s showed that African-American students made gains in same-sex schools . In particular , he says that the single-sex setting offers them a sense of power and control they may otherwise lack . <p> David Sadker , an education professor at American University in Washington , has found that single-sex education has positive effects on girls , as he documented in " Failing at Fairness : How Our Schools Cheat Girls , " the 1995 book he wrote with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supporter of the Department of Education 's proposal to change Title IX . <p> It is " a perverse anniversary of the Brown decision , " Mr. Sadker says . " Here , 50 years after Brown , we 're actually codifying segregation . " He adds , " The problem is fixing the coed classroom , not escaping from it . " <p> Students at Girls High do n't suggest that single-sex education is the answer for everyone . But what she does know , says Monique , is that she 's very glad Girls High exists for girls like her " who want to get a good education . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
