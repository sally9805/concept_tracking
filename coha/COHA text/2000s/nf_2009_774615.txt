Saving a Child // On your way to work , you pass a small pond . On hot days , children sometimes play in the pond , which is only about knee-deep . The weather ? s cool today , though , and the hour is early , so you are surprised to see a child splashing about in the pond . As you get closer , you see that it is a very young child , just a toddler , who is flailing about , unable to stay upright or walk out of the pond . You look for the parents or babysitter , but there is no one else around . The child is unable to keep his head above the water for more than a few seconds at a time . If you don ? t wade in and pull him out , he seems likely to drown . Wading in is easy and safe , but you will ruin the new shoes you bought only a few days ago , and get your suit wet and muddy . By the time you hand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clothes , you ? ll be late for work . What should you do ? // I teach a course called Practical Ethics . When we start talking about global poverty , I ask my students what they think you should do in this situation . Predictably , they respond that you should save the child . " What about your shoes ? And being late for work ? " I ask them . They brush that aside . How could anyone consider a pair of shoes , or missing an hour or two at work , a good reason for not saving a child ? s life ? // In 2007 , something resembling this hypothetical situation actually occurred near Manchester , England . Jordon Lyon , a ten-year-old boy , leaped into a pond after his stepsister Bethany slipped in . He struggled to support her but went under himself . Anglers managed to pull Bethany out , but by then Jordon could no longer be seen . They raised the alarm , and two auxiliary policemen soon arrived ; they refused to enter the pond to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at resuscitation failed . At the inquest on Jordon ? s death , the policemen ? s inaction was defended on the grounds that they had not been trained to deal with such situations . The mother responded : " If you ? re walking down the street and you see a child drowning you automatically go in that water . . . You don ? t have to be trained to jump in after a drowning child . " 1 // I think it ? s safe to assume that most people would agree with the mother ? s statement . But consider that , according to UNICEF , nearly 10 million children under five years old die each year from causes related to poverty . Here is just one case , described by a man in Ghana to a researcher from the World Bank : // Take the death of this small boy this morning , for example . The boy died of measles . We all know he could have been cured at the hospital . But the parents had no money and so the boy died a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poverty.2 // Think about something like that happening 27,000 times every day . Some children die because they don ? t have enough to eat . More die , like that small boy in Ghana , from measles , malaria , diarrhea , and pneumonia , conditions that either don ? t exist in developed nations , or , if they do , are almost never fatal . The children are vulnerable to these diseases because they have no safe drinking water , or no sanitation , and because when they do fall ill , their parents can ? t afford any medical treatment . UNICEF , Oxfam , and many other organizations are working to reduce poverty and provide clean water and basic health care , and these efforts are reducing the toll . If the relief organizations had more money , they could do more , and more lives would be saved . // Now think about your own situation . By donating a relatively small amount of money , you could save a child ? s life . Maybe it takes more than the amount needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on things we don ? t really need , whether on drinks , meals out , clothing , movies , concerts , vacations , new cars , or house renovation . Is it possible that by choosing to spend your money on such things rather than contributing to an aid agency , you are leaving a child to die , a child you could have saved ? // Poverty Today // A few years ago , the World Bank asked researchers to listen to what the poor are saying . They were able to document the experiences of 60,000 women and men in seventy-three countries . Over and over , in different languages and on different continents , poor people said that poverty meant these things : // *You are short of food for all or part of the year , often eating only one meal per day , sometimes having to choose between stilling your child ? s hunger or your own , and sometimes being able to do neither . // *You can ? t save money . If a family member falls ill and you need money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have nothing to eat , you have to borrow from a local moneylender and he will charge you so much interest at the debt continues to mount and you may never be free of it . // *You can ? t afford to send your children to school , or if they do start school , you have to take them out again if the harvest is poor . // *You live in an unstable house , made with mud or thatch that you need to rebuild every two or three years , or after severe weather . // *You have no nearby source of safe drinking water . You have to carry your water a long way , and even then , it can make you ill unless you boil it . // But extreme poverty is not only a condition of unsatisfied material needs . It is often accompanied by a degrading state of powerlessness . Even in countries that are democracies and are relatively well governed , respondents to the World Bank survey described a range of situations in which they had to accept humiliation without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you complain to the police , they may not listen to you . Nor will the law necessarily protect you from rape or sexual harassment . You have a pervading sense of shame and failure because you can not provide for your children . Your poverty traps you , and you lose hope of ever escaping from a life of hard work for which , at the end , you will have nothing to show beyond bare survival.3 // The World Bank defines extreme poverty as not having enough income to meet the most basic human needs for adequate food , water , shelter , clothing , sanitation , health care , and education . Many people are familiar with the statistic that one billion people are living on less than one dollar per day . That was the World Bank ? s poverty line until 2008 , when better data on international price comparisons enabled it to make a more accurate calculation of the amount people need to meet their basic needs . On the basis of this calculation , the World Bank set the poverty line at $1.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them under this line is not 1 billion but 1.4 billion . That there are more people living in extreme poverty than we thought is , of course , bad news , but the news is not all bad . On the same basis , in 1981 there were 1.9 billion people living in extreme poverty . That was about four in every ten people on the planet , whereas now fewer than one in four are extremely poor . // South Asia is still the region with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty , a total of 600 million , including 455 million in India . Economic growth has , however , reduced the proportion of South Asians living in extreme poverty from 60 percent in 1981 to 42 percent in 2005 . There are another 380 million extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa , where half the population is extremely poor  --  and that is the same percentage as in 1981 . The most dramatic reduction in poverty has been in East Asia , although there are still more than 200 million extremely poor Chinese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely poor people are distributed around the world , in Latin America and the Caribbean , the Pacific , the Middle East , North Africa , Eastern Europe , and Central Asia.4 // In response to the " $1.25 a day " figure , the thought may cross your mind that in many developing countries , it is possible to live much more cheaply than in the industrialized nations . Perhaps you have even done it yourself , backpacking around the world , living on less than you would have believed possible . So you may imagine that this level of poverty is less extreme than it would be if you had to live on that amount of money in the United States , or any industrialized nation . If such thoughts did occur to you , you should banish them now , because the World Bank has already made the adjustment in purchasing power : Its figures refer to the number of people existing on a daily total consumption of goods and services  --  whether earned or home-grown  --  comparable to the amount of goods and services that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies , most poverty is relative . People feel poor because many of the good things they see advertised on television are beyond their budget  --  but they do have a television . In the United States , 97 percent of those classified by the Census Bureau as poor own a color TV . Three quarters of them own a car . Three quarters of them have air conditioning . Three quarters of them have a VCR or DVD player . All have access to health care.5 I am not quoting these figures in order to deny that the poor in the United States face genuine difficulties . Nevertheless , for most , these difficulties are of a different order than those of the world ? s poorest people . The 1.4 billion people living in extreme poverty are poor by an absolute standard tied to the most basic human needs . They are likely to be hungry for at least part of each year . Even if they can get enough food to fill their stomachs , they will probably be malnourished because their diet lacks essential nutrients . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . The poor may not be able to afford to send their children to school . Even minimal health care services are usually beyond their means . //
