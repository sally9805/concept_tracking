Trying to predict what will be funny in 25 years is as hard as trying to figure out what will be funny five minutes from now . In fact , I would be hard pressed to identify what it is we all laugh at today . <P> Computer scientists , bioresearchers and gagmeisters are all in agreement that the face of comedy will change drastically in the next quarter-century . But what will that face look like ? Will it have good skin and aquiline features , or will it be pockmarked and disfigured ? No one knows , not even our most respected comedic minds . I time , Star Wars : Episode I  --  The Phantom Menace . But he did n't return my calls . <P> So here are several speculations , based on a fair amount of fact , as to what we have in store . <P> Breeding New Comedians While there has been much ballyhoo in the past decade over progress in cinematic special effects with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) , no one has been talking , at least publicly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedic gene engineering ( CGE ) . Manipulating genes to alter the makeup of a human 's looks and personality has been in the realm of possibility for years . But the prospect of doing it for comedic effect is just starting to take shape . Scientists are working to isolate the specific genetic code responsible for what makes us laugh  --  the " funny-bone gene , " if you will . By breaking down the DNA of such comedic greats of the past as W.C. Fields , researchers are hoping that they can learn what it was in these classic funnymen that made them funny . While the research has yet to hit pay dirt , an unexpected side benefit has been the discovery of a new " alcoholism gene . " <P> Once scientists succeed , the possibilities for comedic breeding are unlimited . By scraping cells from the fingernail of Lucille Ball , say , and from one of Ed Asner 's eyebrows , a geneticist would have the tools necessary to fertilize the embryo of a child with specific kinds of comedic potential . Though testing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate gauge , since it is hard to distinguish their laugh from an oink-snort  --  results are promising . Some studios and networks are toying with the idea of " development nurseries " that would venture to create the optimal candidates for sitcom stardom through gene manipulation . <P> Serious moral and legal questions are already being raised by these gene experiments . For example , if a clone of comedian Don Rickles were to grow up and entertain a whole new generation of audiences by insulting them with the term hockey puck , would the Rickles estate be entitled to royalties ? Or could Ricklebaby claim them as his own , since it was his natural instinct to use the term ? And for that matter , can anyone at all claim ownership of the term hockey puck , including the National Hockey League ? <P> Fast Is Funny
