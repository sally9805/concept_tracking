<p> Look What I Found <p> <p> Though he was filthy from head to toe , bloodied , and his skin shredded as thoroughly as a cat 's scratching post , Omad could n't suppress a grin . He was a miner with a knack for finding veins of valuable material even in old , worked-out quarries , and he felt in his bones that today was his day . Today he 'd find something valuable enough to achieve his dream , and achieve it at the respectably early age of sixty-nine . His stock was selling for 183 credits a share , and all he needed was one more good find and GCI would owe him enough credits to enable him to buy a majority of himself . Even if his stock price rose , as was often the case with personal success , he could still make majority . He 'd just have to pray that his personal valuation would n't go over 200 credits a share , and that he 'd take home at least 20,000 credits from this venture . Yes , Omad was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The thought of being able to choose his own vacation times and consume what ever substance he wanted , when he wanted , almost made him too excited to work . But he quelled his feelings of joy and concentrated on the task at hand . <p> <p> He was walking into a mine on GCI 's property that had n't been worked in centuries , and he was walking in without a corporation mine car or drill-bot . The less of GCI 's equipment he used , the less of a percentage they 'd be able to claim of his profits . It was n't the norm , and he 'd never have been as successful without corporate sponsorship and equipment , but this was different . Though it might take a little longer , this excavation would have to be done carefully and in person . Maximum allowable risk for maximum profit , and the risks were real . <p> <p> Still , it was in these old mines that sometimes one got lucky . The technology of mineral extraction had improved greatly in the four centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the science of mineral transmutation had been born , and some metals were easier to transform from one into another . Many a decrepit lead mine had been reopened to turn its once worthless innards into a marketable commodity . And when this one was closed and forgotten in the late 1800s , it was done so out of prudence . It had been stripped bare , and there was simply no point in keeping it open any longer . What ever possible riches lay in waiting now , Omad was sure of one thing  --  he would be the first to find them . <p> <p> He took his time with the mine scan . Impatience might make him miss something , and even walls as old as these left hundreds of chemical and structural clues . Know before you go , he reminded himself . The first part of the morning was spent insuring that the caverns were sound . He need not have worried . The mountain was formed of igneous rock  --  a type of hardened molten lava that had lasted eons and would last for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was convinced the dig was stable . His safety assured , he now began looking for the telltale clues of wealth  --  wealth that could be shared with his investors , his employers , and himself . If he was right about this place , all would benefit from the investment that individuals and society had made in him  --  as it should be . Omad would also be pleased to gain 51 percent of himself , which was also as it should be . <p> <p> His thoughts were interrupted and his dreams almost shattered by what appeared before him  --  a tunnel shaft in abject disarray . It was blocked by a few large boulders among hundreds of smaller shards in all shapes and sizes . What had he missed ? The sight of such instability alone almost made him turn back and choose a new mine . He had just conjectured that this one would last eons , and now here was proof that it was coming down a lot sooner than expected . Clearly a malfunction on the part of his hardware , he reasoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him what he already knew : The type of rock he 'd ventured into did n't need a reader to give up its history  --  only to verify it . He would exchange the mine-reader when he returned . But against his better judgment , or perhaps because of it , he decided to venture a little farther . <p> <p> There was something here and he knew it . Plus , he was driven by his personal mantra , " Little risk , little profit , " so he bent to examine the crumbled evidence before him . Explosives , he realized , upon examining the shards . Not a " natural " cave in after all . More evidence lay in Omad 's path . What ever , or more precisely , whoever had made this mess had left the detonator , some primitive blasting caps , and humorously , an instruction manual on how to set off explosives in a mine . Since no skeleton or evidence of a body was visible , the perpetrator had obviously read the manual well , done the deed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something called " Twinkies . " Omad picked it up and examined it carefully . Aside from its unique and unusual artwork , he was able to discern its key ingredients as well as something called an " EXP " date , which was marked from an eleventh month in what appeared to be the early twenty-first century . This was starting to get interesting . He gathered all the wrappers and placed them in an airtight container , along with the manual and blasting caps he had so far collected . Omad loved a mystery , and judging from the leftover wrappers , whoever blasted this tunnel had time to eat at least twenty-eight of these Twinkie things and walk out in one piece . Must have been some kind of nutritional energy snack , he thought , as he cracked his knuckles and continued on deeper into the shaft . The dry , consistent atmosphere had preserved the scene almost as if the long-gone blaster had left just before Omad had arrived . Even if he could n't make a profit out of what was buried in the tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just discovered outside of it . The nutritional wrappers and blaster manual alone would fetch a very good price on the open relic market . No , even if he found nothing else , today would not be a loss by any stretch of the imagination . <p> <p> Neela Harper was not a country girl . In fact , she 'd always preferred the big city . Anything with only a million and a half people in it just did n't seem natural . If she had had any inkling that the career she had chosen for herself would dump her in this remote part of the world she probably would n't have chosen it . Then again , being a minority shareholder in herself , she would have had little or no say whatsoever about her place of employ . Luck of the draw , she thought somberly to herself . And this year I 'm clearly down on my luck . Anybody looking at her would not be displeased . She was five feet eleven inches  --  about average for a woman . A very healthy thirty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nano-medicine ; positively everyone was healthy , and everyone looked great . Still , if everybody was a giant health-wise , then Neela , by her rigorous adherence to exercise , stood on the shoulders of those giants . Her appearance was 97 percent original , with only minor changes to control her hair growth and the removal of some facial bone damage suffered in a childhood accident . She had n't had a sex change or so much as a boob job by her eighteenth birthday , something that was practically a rite of passage for her generation . Nope , just chestnut hair , green eyes , a tiny nose , freckles , and a supremely athletic body . Her problem was not so much physical as it was economic . <p> <p> Not knowing what she wanted to do with her life , she spent all of high school and most of college studying the basics . Nothing wrong with that . And she did well with all the courses she took . In some ways it was helping her now , but not in terms of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned 35 percent of themselves , she only owned a paltry 30.5 percent . It had nothing to do with gambling or expensive trips . Her debt was an investment . Those who knew they were going to go into an expensive or prestigious field prepared themselves by maintaining a stellar GPA . Further , they specialized in a chosen field all through high school and university . Thus , by the time they got to the advanced , and therefore expensive , part of their training , they were better able to bargain for lower percentages . And so the university-cum-investor was held to grabbing only 7 to 9 percent of that student 's self-equity , as opposed to the standard 12 to 15 percent . Rumor even had it that one top-fight student had received her education from San Francisco State University , the top Pacific League school , for an amazingly low 4 percent . But Neela was n't prepared to commit to a major she did n't feel strongly about , and it was n't until her junior year that she felt such passion . And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was now turning out to be a costly virtue indeed . As far as majors went , she 'd picked a doozy . Neela was going to be a reanimation psychologist with a subspecialty in social integration . Since reanimation psychology was considered a prestigious field , what institution of higher learning would risk educating a latecomer when they could get more valuable stock in a better prospect ? <p> <p> The answer was a not-so-great institution of higher learning , Harvard , and the loss of more personal stock than she would have preferred  --  14 percent , to be exact . That , combined with what her parents , the government , and various other organizations held , gave her what in this day and age amounted to a measly 30.5 percent of herself . This also meant she had very little bargaining power as to where she was going to start her glorious career . If she had realized her dream , or just a better percentage of it , she would have been working in the famed Vegas reanimation clinics . They had suspendees yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suspension , rumored to be close to two hundred years old . Those suspendees would be from the early days of the incorporation movement and might even have personal memories of the Grand Collapse . Any one of them would make a great thesis subject . Yes , Vegas had it all : interesting patients , great bonuses , and the chance to publish . And with that kind of clout , Neela would have been able to negotiate a vertical position for a better percentage on the slow and steady climb to 51 percent . And that , she believed , was what it was all about . <p> <p> At 51 percent she 'd have almost absolute control over her life . The only drawback would be a lack of insurance . One percent was only a hair-thin margin should , heaven forbid , she find herself needing extra funds . The further she could move her own percentage up , the better she 'd sleep at night . <p> <p> With GCI controlling her outright majority through a proxy agreement with Harvard ( bastards ! ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Union for as long as they deemed profitable . Neela gained little solace from the one dubious distinction her location had as part of its claim to fame . It was , in fact , the smallest reanimation clinic in the world . Miners and ranchers who got into bad accidents were frozen and sent here . At most they would be bathed in liquid nitrogen for six months while some body parts were regrown or memory networks painfully restructured . They did n't need a reanimation specialist at all beyond some standard death trauma issues and , to be honest , not much social integration either . After all , how out of touch was a suspendee going to be if down for only six months ? Oh , there were the little things of course . She knew how to sympathetically impart bad news regarding a suspendee 's family , whether it be an untimely and permanent death or , as was often the case , spousal abandonment . She knew to keep up with the latest trends and , much to her chagrin , the latest sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suspendee awoke asking , " How 'd the Broncos do ? " she 'd have gotten her majority eons ago . <p> <p> Out here she would never meet what she affectionately referred to as " the time travelers . " They were Vegas 's unopened treasures waiting for the precise technology to ensure their successful reanimation . And at the pace technology was evolving , it would n't take long . By the time she got out of her current locale , or rather , if she ever got out of her current locale , the time travelers would all have been reanimated by others , who would have published their findings to a fascinated world and retired at the impossibly young age of seventy . Neela , on the other hand , would get typecast as a " short-term specialist " and would probably never leave Boulder in her working life again . <p> <p> Neela 's phone vibrated , and she held her thumbnail to her ear . She squinted her eyes , trying to bring her retro wall clock with the phosphorus tips into focus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general direction of her pinkie . <p> <p> " Whoever died , I do n't care , " she said with her eyes closed . " Just freeze them and call me in the morning . " The voice on the other end answered her so clearly it was as if he were in the bed next to her . <p> <p> " Neela , sorry to wake you , but you are the primary revive specialist on call for this week , and we have something that needs a sign-off . " <p> <p> Neela sighed . <p> <p> " Watanabe , this had better be good . " <p> <p> " Neela , I do n't know what it is . " The genuine confusion in the voice of her contact made her sit up . The emergency rescue ser vice always knew what was going on . That they now did n't shook her out of her daze . <p> <p> " All right , Ben , I 'm on my way . " <p> <p> " Do n't bother , Neela , we 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> <p> " I know how to get to center , Ben , " she answered , with no small amount of disdain . <p> <p> " That 's good , but you 're not going to center . " <p> <p> " Ben , I 'm no good at the medical end of suspension . I get them after they 're thawed , remember ? " <p> <p> " Trust me , Neela , you 'll want to see this . " Neela heard the soft pop that told her the phone was disconnected . She managed to prop herself up . In her semicomatose state she laid out in her mind what she 'd wear . She decided on an all-weather outfit . It would be a little more cumbersome but would come in handy just in case this call led her up into the mountains . This day was becoming very out of the ordinary , and for someone with a daily routine as rote as hers , any chance to shake things up was certainly worth the extra effort required to drag herself out of bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly about the mountains , and was certainly not surprised to see evidence of a mine being cleared of rock . It was still dark as the flyer landed , but she could make out the entrance to the shaft only because it had been painted with Daylight , an amazing substance , she thought , that lived up to its brand name . About twenty rescue workers were operating heavy machinery , and she could see that a few more were spraying a fresh line of Daylight down the mine entrance leading into the tunnel . The pile of freshly cut logs stacked fifty yards away told her that this area had been heavily wooded until the crew got here . <p> <p> Whoever 's in there must be important , she thought . That would explain why they wanted her here  --  the expert witness lined up neatly with the rest of the bureaucratic pawns so necessary to make sure the paperwork . owed smoothly . It was only after the flyer landed near the log pileup that Neela realized what was missing . There were no emergency medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind , just a cleanup crew . <p> <p> As she got out of the flyer she saw Ben coming forward to meet her . They exchanged formal waves . <p> <p> " What 's going on , Ben ? " <p> <p> " It started when a company prospector was researching abandoned mines . He found this one by chance . All records of it had been removed from the official databases . " <p> <p> " But that 's not possible , " she answered , scratching her chin . " No record of this mine means this site 's got ta be at least . . . " <p> <p> " . . . three , maybe four centuries old , " continued Ben , " at least , according to the prospector we talked to . " Why 'd they haul a reanimationist out here ? Wondered Neela . Her heart skipped a beat . No , she thought . Do n't even go there . <p> <p> " So , " she continued , trying to contain her trepidation , " how did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " <p> <p> Watanabe smirked , knowing full well what Neela was really asking , but he decided to play along . " His name 's Omad  --  a grade 7-B prospector . And , according to him , he found it because it was mentioned in the old mining reports of two other mines . " <p> <p> They walked hurriedly into the now well-lit mine . After a few hundred yards Neela found herself at the point where the roof had caved in . She waved at some of the rescue team members she recognized , including Rita , a woman she 'd helped with a revival trauma about three months earlier . Fortunately for Rita , hers had been a particularly mild death , requiring only a two-day suspension . At the end of the cleared tunnel Neela saw a circular chamber about forty feet in diameter with a ceiling of about seven feet . It was what she saw in the middle of the space that stopped her cold  --  a large rectangular box measuring roughly ten feet by five feet by six feet encased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible section of the box was covered with inscriptions that were carved into the surface and filled in with a red ceramic material . This gave the box an ethereal appearance that reminded Neela of a sarcophagus . She slowly circled the coffer , absorbing its every detail . <p> <p> " Like something out of a legend , " whispered Neela . <p> <p> " I know what you mean , " replied Ben . " Normally I 'm not suspicious , but may my stock drop if I said that that , " he pointed to a specific inscription , " did n't freak me out . " <p> <p> Neela looked closer . <p> <p> Some of the writing was in English , some in Chinese , some in Hebrew ; there was even something that seemed to be a series of elevated dots and dashes . On what she now ascertained to be the lid of the case were a series of large characters with a very simple message : <p> <p> THIS IS A LIFE POD . A MAN LIES SUSPENDED WITHIN . <p> <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped over Ben in the process . <p> <p> " Holy shit , " she whispered . <p> <p> Ben smiled and nodded . <p> <p> " Holy , holy shit , Ben , " she repeated . Ask it , Neela . Ask the damned question ! she prodded herself . <p> <p> " Is . . . is it operational ? " she asked , barely able to utter the words . <p> <p> " Seems to be , " Ben replied , still smiling . " You still with us ? " <p> <p> " Uh . . . yeah . . . sorry , Ben . " <p> <p> " You can see why we called you . And that 's not all , " he continued , pointing to the surrounding walls . " We ran a groundar to see if anything was stuck in the walls . " He waited a moment . <p> <p> " Well ? " Neela demanded . <p> <p> " We found six hollowed-out chambers , spaced equidistantly around this main one . Get this  --  they were shielded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking her eyes off the unit to look around the cavern , " you do n't know what 's inside , then ? " <p> <p> Ben hesitated for a moment . " Well , not exactly , " he answered , keeping his head low as he kicked one foot in the dirt . " We did open the one . " <p> <p> Neela 's face lit up . " You did what ? Are you nuts ! ? They could have been booby-trapped for all we know , or you could have destroyed precious artifacts ! " <p> <p> " Hey , take it easy , Neela , " answered Ben , " we only opened one , and entirely by accident , I can assure you . " Neela gave him a disapproving look . <p> <p> " But you 'll never guess what we found inside , " he continued , knowing she 'd soon forgive him in all the excitement of the find . " Gold bullion . Can you believe that ? Imagine going through all that trouble just to store a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there for all it 's worth . " <p> <p> " Ben , " Neela asked , " how long do you think it 's been since gold was used as a commodity ? " <p> <p> " I du n no . I 'm not good at history ; maybe five hundred years ? " <p> <p> " You 're right . You 're not good at history , " she replied with a smirk . " It 's less than two hundred and . fty . And I 'm willing to bet this man has been here for at least that long . " <p> <p> " Long time to be down , " Ben replied . <p> <p> " Did you get a doctor in here ? " <p> <p> " First thing we did . He did n't know what it was . . . and neither did his Dij - Assist ! He 's back at his lab running a search for info on a secure Neuro uplink . " <p> <p> " And that 's when you decided to call me ? " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus , I know you , and I do n't know anyone at the university , though that would have been my next call . So anyways , the billion-credit question is , can we move it ? " <p> <p> Before Neela could respond , Rita spoke up from the corner of the box nearest the door . " Uh , boss , I 'm pretty sure we can . " <p> <p> " And how do you know that ? " asked Ben , as he glared at Rita . " Do you have a degree in Unheard-of Technology I do n't know about ? " <p> <p> Rita returned Ben 's glare by pointing to the corner of the unit . " No , I do n't , Mr. Smart Guy . I know it because it says so right here . " They all gathered around to see what she 'd pointed at : <p> <p> THIS UNIT CAN BE MOVED WITHOUT DAMAGING THE MAN INSIDE . <p> <p> FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS WRITTEN BELOW . <p> <p> The group started laughing at how simple yet ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . The tension that had made the place seem haunted was gone . <p> <p> One of the rescue workers , a short , bearded man with a starburst tattoo on his nose , spoke up . " That 's definitely an operational suspension unit . " <p> <p> " I know . I read the inscription , too . But I got ta tell you , it does n't look like any suspension unit I 've ever seen , " Neela answered . <p> <p> " It 's not like any you 've seen , " he continued . " I do n't think it 's like anything anyone 's seen . But that 's a suspension unit , and I 'd be willing to bet my next dividend that there 's a man inside waiting to be revived . What shape he 's in I could n't say , but he 's in there all right ! " <p> <p> " Well , " Ben chimed in , " he 'd better hope that his insurance company survived the GC and still has a policy on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the starburst tattoo . <p> <p> " This revive and extraction is going to cost him a credit or two , and if his insurance does n't kick in , he 's going to lose a good percentage come his quarterly report . " <p> <p> " I do n't think so , " Neela cautioned , something beginning to form in the pit of her stomach . <p> <p> " Why not ? " Ben asked . " Everyone gets an incorporation report . He 's no different . " <p> <p> " Actually , he is , Ben . If we 're to believe the inscription , and if in fact there is a man still in viable stasis , then he 'll be , providing we do our jobs right , the oldest man ever to be revived . " <p> <p> " So ? " Ben asked . <p> <p> " So , " Neela continued , " he 's not going to get a quarterly report . . . " <p> <p> " . . . because he 's never been incorporated , " Rita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted air returned . <p> <p> Ferdinand had reached that stage in life where the dust was beginning to settle . He was n't about to start his own corporation , nor would he retire early . His self-percentage would be a lot better but for a wife who was a sucker for the frivolous little extras that were constantly being offered . But if she was happy , he was happy , right ? After seventy-five years of working the same job , the only silver lining he managed to garner was that he could do basic background work slightly more economically than a computer . What was the old saying ? You could lead a computer to data , but you could n't make it glean . <p> <p> It was a simple job , really . All he had to do was process revives . Boring , routine , safe work . Every once in a while he 'd get an interesting one . Perhaps a complication concerning religious scruples , or maybe even a conflicting liability . Joy . But most of the time raising the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd process the name and occupation of the revival subject , determine who was paying for the procedure , and then inform Legal of any outstanding debts or stock options due . All credit on the account would then be reactivated by the upper echelons at a later date . The trickiest part was informing current stockholders about the reactivation of potential stock in the revived , but that was handled by another department . He had enough on his plate , thank you . The programs for this type of operation had been in place for de cades , and short of the rare " breakthrough " upgrade that entailed a little more learning , it was almost automatic . Ferdinand 's job was only to initiate the process and see that the procedures were followed . In this way he was able to facilitate the smooth flow of the frozen revive 's reentry into the corporate world . <p> <p> He rubbed his eyes . It was only 11:00 a.m. and he 'd already processed forty-two corpsicles . " Next , " he said to the holodisplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> No response . <p> <p> He repeated his request , but this time more irritably : " Computer , next revive . " <p> <p> " Sending information now , " the computer chirped back . <p> <p> Ferdinand looked up . " I did n't ask you to send me information . Just tell me the revive 's name , please . " <p> <p> " Unable to comply . " <p> <p> Ferdinand , figuring the system was in prefritz mode , attempted an end around . <p> <p> " Fine , " he said , rising to the challenge , " can you at least tell me who insured him ? " <p> <p> " Unable to comply . " <p> <p> OK , a real challenge then , he thought . I 'm game . <p> <p> " Computer , access the subject 's genetic code for ID . " <p> <p> Four seconds passed  --  an eternity . <p> <p> " Unable to comply . " <p> <p> " You did n't get a sample of the DNA ? " <p> <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no known correlation in any database available . " <p> <p> Impossible . <p> <p> Though Ferdinand prided himself on being able to solve problems before they became real problems , he knew when he was licked . <p> <p> " Computer , " he said , letting out a sigh , " get me technical support . " <p> <p> " Contacting technical support now , " the machine chirped back . " Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received . " <p> <p> Ten minutes later Ferdinand was interrupted by a bored-looking fellow staring straight at him from the holodisplay . <p> <p> " Tech support , whadyaneed ? " <p> <p> " Are you guys running a beta test on the revive data procurement program and forgot to mention it to us poor slobs in Adjusting ? " <p> <p> " If we are , it 's news to me . Let me check . " The face dissolved into the background . <p> <p> Ferdinand continued working . <p> <p> After another fifteen minutes the tech support fellow 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " was all he said , and before Ferdinand could ask another question the face disappeared . <p> <p> Begrudgingly , Ferdinand returned to the task at hand . " OK , computer , let 's try this again . You 're telling me we have a revive ? " <p> <p> " Correct . " <p> <p> " Do we know where this revive is ? " <p> <p> " The revive is located at the Colorado Mining Hospital in the city of Boulder . " <p> <p> " Good , that 's a start . What 's the make of the suspension unit ? " Sometimes in large disasters with many bodies , information could get lost temporarily . A good way of finding out who the person was would be to track the suspension unit itself . <p> <p> " Unable to comply . " <p> <p> " Computer , is this information restricted or unavailable due to prior command or restraint ? " <p> <p> " Negative . Unable to comply because the information is unavailable to all known databases . If you check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unit as well as all known data . " <p> <p> With a sigh of exasperation , Ferdinand called up the data . After ten minutes of scanning , he nervously keyed the button asking for his supervisor . <p> <p> " What do you mean I 'm going on vacation ? ! " fumed Neela . <p> <p> Before her sat an impeccably dressed man seemingly impervious to the steely glare emanating from Neela 's eyes . <p> <p> " Your passage to Luna City has already been arranged , " the man answered , too stoically for her taste . <p> <p> " Luna City ? ! First of all , in case you have n't noticed , I 'm not exactly in control of my own portfolio here , and I do n't have the kind of equity to give up to go to a place like that . " <p> <p> " Do n't worry , " the man said , not bothering to look up from his holodisplay . <p> <p> " It 's all paid for by GCI . Consider it a bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , if you do n't mind , I 've got work to do . " <p> <p> Neela stood quietly for a moment . <p> <p> " I do n't want the vacation , " she blurted . <p> <p> This got the man 's attention . He stopped staring into the holodisplay , shifted some papers aside , and looked at her intently . <p> <p> " You like your work that much that you 'd give up an all-expenses-paid vacation to a place most people only dream about ? " Neela shifted uncomfortably in her place . " There 's the one-sixth-gravity waterfalls , wing nanites for the Galileo fly-through . The sex alone is worth the trip . Trust me , that I know . " <p> <p> " It 's not the work , " she answered . " It 's this work . This find . . . right now . I never expected to be the primary reanimationist . I knew you 'd bring in a Bronstein or a Gillette . But there 's never going to be another find like this . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You 're really dedicated to this , are n't you ? " <p> <p> " Completely . " <p> <p> The man dived back into his holodisplay and typed in some commands . After a minute or so he looked up . <p> <p> " I may live to regret this , but I 've just bought a thousand shares of your personal stock . " <p> <p> " Why 'd you do that ? " she exclaimed . <p> <p> " I 'm sorry . Most people would find it complimentary . " <p> <p> " Well , I 'm not most people . And I intend to buy back enough of my shares to make majority . " <p> <p> The man let out a guffaw . <p> <p> " Oh . You 're one of those . Well , look , I 'm worth five times your value , and I 'll probably never see majority . Furthermore , why would you even try ? All you 'd get is some additional income  --  and a lot of headache . " He was starting to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you want to or not . It 's already been decided . " <p> <p> Neela stood her ground . " I do n't mean to be a pain , and I know the company owns my ass , but I just do n't understand why I ca n't take this damned vacation after the patient 's already been revived and socially integrated . " <p> <p> This time the man stood up from his desk and looked her right in the eye . As he did this she heard the sounds of corridor traffic in the background  --  the door had opened behind her . <p> <p> " Unless you 're willing to wait five years , " he spat , " that ai n't gon na happen , lady . This conversation is over . Good day . " <p> <p> " Five years ? Did he really say five years ? " <p> <p> Neela was in the director 's office . His name was Mosh McKenzie , and he was the first superior Neela had ever really liked  --  not that she 'd had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand him . He 'd achieved self-majority , which , while commendable , was n't particularly extraordinary . Plus , she 'd met enough of those . Smug bastards most of them . No , Mosh was different . He was the first person she knew who 'd achieved his goals  --  which in his case meant becoming a powerful member of the GCI board of directors  --  and then had himself transferred to this tiny little enclave located somewhere in the bowels of Colorado . Most assumed he 'd screwed up somewhere on his steady climb up the golden ladder and that this was his punishment , but Neela suspected differently . She was a good judge of character , a must in her line of work , and Mosh was not a man who seemed incompetent , and  --  even more telling  --  not upset with his current situation . In fact , Neela would have to say that this was a man supremely content with himself and his place in life . It was true that he was 175 years old and could easily retire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have let him . Of average height at six feet two inches , he was confident enough in himself that when he started to bald he simply let it happen rather than spend the thirty credits it would have cost to prevent the process . Neela had to admit that , although his appearance had shocked her at first , she could n't imagine him looking any other way . <p> <p> " Mosh , " said Neela , " is there any problem medically that I was n't informed of ? " <p> <p> " Actually , " he answered , " now that you mention it , no . " <p> <p> " Do we know why he was suspended ? " Neela continued . <p> <p> Mosh checked his holodisplay . <p> <p> " Says here , lymphatic cancer  --  apparently late stage . Happened back then . " <p> <p> " Hard to believe that was once fatal , " answered Neela , shaking her head . " It would be like allowing a toothache to kill someone . " <p> <p> " Do n't laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , too . " <p> <p> " Just curious , Mosh , how long would it take to cure him ? " <p> <p> He checked the display again . " According to Dr. Wang , six hours to cure , twelve to revive . " <p> <p> Neela thought about it . <p> <p> " So why on Earth would that corporate goon have said five years ? That 's not only unconstitutional , it 's unethical . " She paused . " Barbaric , even . " <p> <p> Mosh called up the accused 's . le on his holodisplay . " Our goon 's name is Hektor . Hektor Sambianco . And you 'd better watch your back with that one . I know the type . They 're like pit bulls ; once they lock on to something it 's hard to get ' em to let go . " <p> <p> " Duly noted , " she answered . " But I do n't get it , Mosh . What exactly is he locked on to ? " <p> <p> Mosh chuckled at the innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear . He wants to incorporate him , and he does n't want to share , if you get my drift . " <p> <p> " Which , " she continued , lightbulbs going off , " explains why everyone around here 's getting paid leave . But it does n't explain five years , Mosh . Keeping anyone down that long when it 's unnecessary is not only illegal , it 's unconstitutional  --  corporation or no corporation . " <p> <p> " True enough , " Mosh said , leaning back into his state-of-the-art Nomic chair . <p> <p> They both knew what was at stake . The " right of return " with regard to reanimation was sacrosanct . And it made sense that it would be . After all , who would willingly suspend themselves knowing their reanimation might not happen due to litigation , corporate interference , or any other manner of legality that might leave someone suspended involuntarily for centuries ? Therefore , the right of return had been enacted into constitutional law almost as soon as reanimation had become technically viable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immediate revival pursuant to the ability to do so safely , without causing any realistic undue hardship to society or the individual in question . <p> <p> " Alright , Neela , " Mosh said , brows cinched tightly , " you 've got my ear . Let me do a little fact-checking and I 'll get back to you . " <p> <p> Ever the perfectionist , Hektor Sambianco was in the transport bay overseeing the final details for shipment . He was also marveling at the beauty of the suspension unit itself . The huge black rectangle inscribed with the fiery red letters had a compelling presence all its own , unlike the simple and economical teardrop units currently in use . Hektor saw right away that the unit would be worth untold credits  --  regardless of the prize within . But the prize within , if successfully revived , could be worth quite a bit as well  --  a man from preincorporation America . There was no telling how much profit would be in it for GCI  --  and even better , what kind of bonus share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled , remembering his recent conversation with that ornery revivalist . I might just make majority after all . <p> <p> Hektor 's musings were rudely interrupted by the sound of confrontation . He turned around to see Director McKenzie and the revivalist woman being denied access to the bay by one of the guards he 'd stationed as a precautionary mea sure . <p> <p> " The last time I checked , " Mosh said to the newly stationed guard , " I was still the director here , and this is still my transport bay . " <p> <p> " Actually , " proclaimed Hektor from across the bay , " the hospital  --  transport bay included  --  still belongs to GCI , unless , of course , you 've made some large purchases I 'm not aware of . Nevertheless . . . " Hektor signaled the guard to let them pass . <p> <p> Mosh and Neela quickly traversed the bay to where Hektor was working . <p> <p> " Make it quick , please , " Hektor said , " I do n't have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-eight minutes , and twenty-two seconds to be exact , " the director answered , consulting his DijAssist . <p> <p> " You 've been checking up on me , I see . " <p> <p> Mosh was about to answer but was beat out by Neela . <p> <p> " Who do you think you are ? ! " <p> <p> " Hektor Sambianco , " he replied casually . " No need for you to introduce yourself , thank you . " <p> <p> " I think , " Mosh offered , " my overwrought employee is upset with what you 're planning to do . " <p> <p> " No , " interjected Neela . " I 'm upset with what he 's planning not to do ! " Turning her wrath again toward Hektor , " How can you leave him suspended ? " <p> <p> " Do n't you worry your little head , " Hektor answered condescendingly . " We 'll revive him , all in good time . Yes , anyways , thank you for sharing your feelings . I 'll make sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to . " He then turned his back on them , continuing his preparations . <p> <p> Neela and Mosh remained in place . <p> <p> " I may have a difficult time signing the clearance order to move this unit , " said Mosh . " You know , busy schedule and all . My assistant could do it , but , oh my , " he said as he pressed a button on his DijAssist , " I just gave her the rest of the day off . " <p> <p> With a sigh , Hektor turned around . <p> <p> " Perhaps I was a bit single-minded in pursuit of completing my job . What is it you need , Director ? " <p> <p> Good , Mosh thought , he 's got his eyes on the ball . <p> <p> " An explanation would be a start . " <p> <p> " An explanation about what ? " Hektor asked , feigning innocence . <p> <p> " About why you seem to be denying this man his civil rights , " challenged Neela . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his civil rights ? " <p> <p> " The Constitution . . . , " began Neela . <p> <p> " . . . does not apply here , " finished Hektor . <p> <p> " And who gave you the right to say that the Constitution does not apply ? " Neela retorted . <p> <p> Hektor smirked . " Actually , I 'm a constitutional lawyer . Who gave you the right to say that it does ? " Chew on that one , bitch . <p> <p> " Lawyer or not , " Neela continued unfazed , " this man has to be revived immediately . It 's the law , and every citizen knows that . " <p> <p> " OK , Miss . . . Harper , was it ? " Hektor began . " Let 's just see about that law that every citizen knows about . First of all , how do you even know this man is a citizen ? If he 's not , constitutional law does n't apply , does it ? Did n't think about that , did you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some horrific act or acts he committed . Constitution or no , do you want to take responsibility for rereleasing him into our society ? Would it not be prudent to wait and run some tests , and then perhaps let the courts decide ? " <p> <p> " We ran all the tests needed , " answered Neela . " He 's curable and poses no medical danger to society . Under the criteria of the Constitution and the Supreme Court 's interpretation of it , no other consideration is needed  --  citizen or not . All crimes or debts will be dealt with upon revival . " <p> <p> " Bravo , " Hektor chided , clapping his hands slowly . " I see you know the legal aspects of your profession well . But you 're forgetting one thing . " <p> <p> " He 's curable and he 's here , " she spat back . " That 's the only criteria . I 'm forgetting nothing . " <p> <p> " Payment , " the director said , choosing the moment to step in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal him on payment .
