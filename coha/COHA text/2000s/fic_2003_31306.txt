My first conscious memory is of being three years old and looking down at my new baby brother with a mixture of curiosity and distress . His crib had not been delivered on time , and he was sleeping in my doll carriage , thereby displacing my favorite doll , who was ready for her nap . Luke and Nora , my father and mother , had kept company for seven years , a typical Irish courtship . He was forty-two and she pushing forty when they finally tied the knot . They had Joseph within the year ; me , Mary , nineteen months later ; and Mother celebrated her forty-fifth birthday by giving birth to Johnny . The story is that when the doctor went into her room , saw the newborn in her arms and the rosary entwined in her fingers , he observed , " I assume this one is Jesus . " Since we were n't Hispanic , in which culture Jesus is a common name , John , the first cousin of the Holy Family , was the closest Mother could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School and instructed to write J.M.J. , which stood for Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , on the top of our test papers , I thought it was a tribute to Joe and me and Johnny . The year 1931 , when Johnny made his appearance , was a good one in our modest world . My father 's Irish pub was flourishing . In anticipation of the new arrival , my parents had purchased a home in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx . At that time more rural than suburban , it was only two streets away from Angelina 's farm . Angelina , a wizened elderly lady , would show up every afternoon on the street outside our house , pushing a cart with fresh fruit and vegetables . " God blessa your momma , your poppa , tella them I got ta lotsa nicea stringabeans today , " she would say . Our house , 1913 Tenbroeck Avenue , was a semidetached six-room brick-and-stucco structure with a second half bath in a particularly chilly section of the basement . My mother 's joy in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she and my father had paid ten thousand five for it , while Anne and Charlie Potters , who bought the other side , had only paid ten thousand dollars for the identical space . " It 's because your father has his own business , and we were driving an expensive new car , " she lamented . But the expensive new car , a Nash , had sprung an oil leak as they drove it out of the showroom . " It was the beginning of our luck going sour , " she would later reminisce . The Depression had set in with grim reality . I remember as a small child regularly watching Mother answering the door to find a man standing there , his clothes clean but frayed , his manner courteous . He was looking for work , any kind of work . Did anything need repairing or painting ? And if not , could we possibly help him out with a cup of coffee , and maybe something to eat . Mother never turned away anyone . She left a card table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest . Juice , coffee , a soft-boiled egg and toast in the morning , sandwiches and tea for lunch . I do n't remember anyone ringing the bell after midafternoon . By then , God help them , they were probably on their way home , if they had a home to go to , with the disheartening news that there was no work to be had . I loved our house and our neighborhood . Mine was the little room , its window over the front door . I would wake in the morning to the clipclop of the horses pulling the milk and bread wagons . Borden 's milk . Dugan 's bread and cake . Sights that have passed into oblivion as surely as the patient horses and creaking wagons that teased me awake and comforted me with their familiarity all those years ago . A box was in permanent residence on the front steps of our house to hold the milk bottles . In the winter , I used to gauge the temperature by checking to see if the cream at the top of the bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the summer , in midafternoon , we 'd all be alert for the sound of jingling bells that meant that Eddy , the Good Humor Man , was wheeling his heavy bicycle around the corner . Looking back , I realize he could n't have been more than in his early thirties . With a genuine smile and the patience of Job , he waited while the kids gathered around him , agonizing over their choice of flavor . All of us had the same routine : a nickle on weekdays for a Dixie cup ; a dime on Sunday for a Good Humor on a stick . That was the hardest day for making up my mind . I loved burnt almond over vanilla ice cream . On the other hand , I also loved chocolate over chocolate . Once the choice had been made , the trick for Joe and John and me was to see who could make the ice cream last the longest so that the other guys ' tongues would be hanging out as they watched the winner enjoy those final licks . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was n't unusual for the one who made it last the longest to see half the Good Humor slide off the stick and land on the ground . Then the howls of anguish from the afflicted delighted the other two , who now had the satisfaction of chanting , " Ha , ha . Thought you were so smart . " Eddy the Good Humor Man had lost the thumb and index finger of his left hand up to the knuckle . He explained that there had been something wrong with the spring of the heavy refrigerator lid , and it had smashed down on those fingers . " But it was a good accident , " he explained . " The company gave me forty-two dollars , and I was able to buy a winter coat for my wife . She really needed one . " The Depression did n't really hit our family until I was in the third or fourth grade . We had a cleaning woman , German Mary , whom we called " Lally " because she would come up the block singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model for Lally in my second book , A Stranger Is Watching . Back then , she was the first perk to go . We always had two copies of the Times delivered each day . One copy was saved , and I delivered it to the convent on my way to school the next morning . In those days the nuns were not allowed to read the current day 's paper . But as times got increasingly tough , they were out of luck . Mother had to cancel the delivery of both papers . I guess when you think about it , the delivery guy was out of luck , too . I wrote my first poem when I was six . I still have it because Mother saved everything I wrote . She also insisted that I recite everything I wrote for the benefit of anyone who happened to be visiting . Since she had four sisters and many cousins , all of whom visited frequently , I am sure there must have been regular if silent groans when she would announce , " Mary has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recite it for us . Mary , stand on the landing and recite your lovely new poem . " When I was finished thrilling everyone with my latest gem , my mother led the applause . " Mary is very gifted , " she would announce . " Mary is going to be a successful writer when she grows up . " Looking back , I am sure that the captive audience was ready to strangle me , but I am intensely grateful for that early vote of absolute confidence I received . When I started sending out short stories and getting them back by return mail , I never got discouraged . Mother 's voice always rang in my subconscious . Someday I was going to be a successful writer . I was going to make it . That 's why , if I may , I 'd like to direct a few words to parents and teachers : When a child comes to you wanting to share something he or she has written or sketched , be generous with your praise . If it 's a written piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the creativity and applaud it . The flame of inspiration needs to be encouraged . Put a glass around that small candle and protect it from discouragement or ridicule . I also started writing skits , which I bullied Joe and John into performing with me . I served as writer , director , producer , and star . I remember Johnny 's plaintive request , " Ca n't I ever be the star ? " " No , I wrote it , " I explained . " When you write it , you get to be the star . " Mother 's unmarried sisters , May and Agnes , were our most frequent visitors and therefore the longest suffering witnesses to my developing talent . May was eleven months older than Mother and , like her , had been a buyer in a Fifth Avenue department store . Ag , the second youngest in the family , fell in love at twenty-four with Bill Barrett , a good-looking , affable detective , fourteen years her senior . There was one fly in the ointment : old Mrs. Barrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with her feet on the couch , had begged Bill not to marry until God called her . She was sure her death was imminent and wanted him under her roof when her time came . Months became years . Everyone loved Bill , but from time to time I could hear Mother urging Agnes to ask him about his intentions . They had been keeping company for twenty-four years when God finally beckoned a Barrett , but it was Bill , not his mother , who died . At ninety-five she was still going strong . Her other son , who 'd been smart enough to marry young , shipped her to a nursing home . Guess who visited her regularly ? Agnes . At seven I was given a five-year diary , one of those leather-bound jobs with four lines allotted for each day and a tiny gold key which , of course , locks nothing . The first entry did n't show much promise . Here it is , in its entirety : " Nothing much happened today . " But then the pages began to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and family . When Mother 's sisters and cousins and courtesy cousins came to visit , the stories would begin around the dining room table , over the teacups . Nora , remember Cousin Fred showing up for your wedding ? ... Mother had sent an invitation to some remote cousins in Pennsylvania , forgetting that Cousin Fred had a lifetime railroad pass . He and his wife showed up on her doorstep the morning of the wedding , their nine-year-old grandson in tow . The lifetime pass included the family . Mother ended up cooking breakfast for them and having the kid running around the house while she and May dressed . Nora , remember how that fellow you were seeing invited Agnes to the formal dance and Poppa was in a rage ? " No man comes into my house and chooses between my daughters , " he said . I loved the old stories . The boys had no patience for them , but I drank them in with the tea . As long as I did n't fidget , I was always welcome to stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . Charlie , a chubby policeman , was Annie 's second husband . She 'd been widowed during the flu epidemic of 1917 , when she was twenty years old . That husband , Bill O'Keefe , rested in her memory as " my Bill . " Charlie was " my Charlie . " They married when both were in their late thirties . " I was so lonesome , " Annie would reminisce . " Every night I 'd cry in my bed for my Bill . But nobody wants to hear your troubles , so I always kept a smile on my face . They called me the Merry Widow . Then I met my Charlie . " Charlie died many years later , at the age of seventy , and two years after that Annie married " my Joe . " When God called him to join his predecessors , Annie began looking around but had n't connected by the time she was reunited with her spouses . A woman with a jutting jaw and dyed red hair , Annie had one of the first permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy metal coils were removed , 60 percent of her hair permanently disappeared with them . Nevertheless , when she looked in the mirror , she saw Helen of Troy and conducted herself accordingly . Annie was the model for my continuing character , Alvirah , the Lottery Winner . At home , the money situation grew tighter , and my father was looking more and more exhausted . His routine had been to sleep until eleven , have brunch , go to " the place , " as he called the pub , come home at five o'clock for a family dinner , then go back to the place until three in the morning . As he had to let one bartender go , then a waiter , and finally the extra bartender , he began to get up earlier and earlier to take over the ordering of supplies and the other details that his employees had formerly handled . The problem was that in those days people ran tabs . They charged drinks , they charged their dinners , and then they could n't pay their bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where new credit was easily granted in the hope that payment eventually would be made . Mother said that the people who were lucky were the ones who worked for the government  --  teachers , firemen , policemen . Maybe that was the reason that when I reached dating age , her prayer for me was that I 'd marry an Irish Catholic with a city job , so I 'd always have a pension . But things were tight even in the city government . Mayor LaGuardia disbanded the Policemen 's Glee Club , of which Charlie Potters was a charter member . That meant that Charlie was back directing traffic and could be heard muttering about how " the fat little midget bastard in City Hall was destroying the city 's culture . " Annie 's father , Mr. Fitzgerald , lived with his daughter and her husband . Known on the block as Old Man Fitz , he 'd sit by the hour on the divider between our stoops , puffing on a pipe , his skinny behind protected by a thick pillow . Every so often he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which if you happened to be passing by was a touch unnerving . Mother decided that if she rented the little room , my room , it would bring in extra money , and so we took in a boarder . We could not know then that our first roomer was but a preview of coming attractions . She was a slender lady of uncertain age , with pale skin , limpid eyes , and wispy hair that she wrapped in a loose chignon . Her wardrobe was sufficient to clothe a convention of similarly sized women . Her effects began to arrive the week before she joined us : a steamer trunk , suitcases , hat boxes . I wondered if she thought she had rented the whole house . Then she arrived , and a problem soon became evident . She began her morning toilette at 5:30 A.M. Back and forth from the little room to the bathroom she flip-flopped on backless high-heeled sandals . The tub roared . The sink gushed . She flushed the toilet at two minute intervals . It was Joe 's theory that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewer system . The bathroom shared a common wall with my father 's bedroom . Daddy was already sleep-deprived , so the last thing he needed was our new tenant . She lasted only one week , so I got my little room back again , at least temporarily . Saturdays we went to the movies . Ten cents bought an afternoon 's entertainment consisting of a double feature , previews of coming attractions , a cartoon , Movietone News ( " The eyes and ears of the world " ) and a Lone Ranger serial . On the way home , we went to confession , hoping to avoid Father Campbell , who could have headed the Spanish Inquisition . I remember trembling as I confessed that I had looked up a bad word in the dictionary . The word was " damn , " and my curiosity had been aroused by the difference between the damned who were going to hell , and Mother telling Daddy to " give up the damn place before it kills you . " Father Campbell did n't ask what word I 'd looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinful purposes . Johnny fared a lot better . When he was mad at me and sprinkled sugar over my baked potato , Mother told him to confess because it was a sin to waste food . He was smart . He went to Father Breen , who was a doll . " What did Father say when you told him what you had done ? " Mother demanded . " He laughed . " There were three girls on the block who were my constant companions : Mary Catherine , Caroline , and Jackie . One day we decided to start a club . Mary Catherine was elected president , Caroline vice-president , and I became secretary . That meant that by default Jackie was the only nonofficer . Seeing the disappointment on her face , I suggested we hold a new election . Unfortunately I did n't present my full plan , which was that we elect Jackie treasurer and then recruit two younger girls , Joan Murphy and Cookie Hilmer , as dues-paying members . We had the new election , and I became the only member without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that sometimes we can be too altruistic . In the meantime , the money situation worsened . The generous household allowance my father gave my mother had to be tightened , and then tightened again . I do n't remember a single night of my childhood that my father was home for an entire evening , except for the Friday evening in May when he did n't go back to work . He said he was n't feeling well . The month of May was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin . The nuns suggested that it would be nice if good Catholic children , especially the girls , made the sacrifice of going to Mass on Saturday morning . That was why on Saturday , May 6 , 1939 , I was returning from the seven o'clock Mass when I turned the corner on Tenbroeck Avenue and saw a police car outside our house . My father had died in his sleep . He was scheduled to go into court on Monday . A judgment had been issued against him for an overdue liquor bill . My mother had begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explain that no one was paying him . His answer had been , " Nora , a gentleman pays his bills . " He was fifty-four years old . I 'd always been a " Daddy 's girl . " On Cape Cod , the early settlers called it the " tortience , " that special bond which often exists between a father and daughter . My father had been born in Roscommon , Ireland , and came to the United States in 1905 when he was twenty-one . I have the record of his arrival at Ellis Island that states he had five pounds in his pocket . Ten years later he became an American citizen . In those days he had to swear that he was neither an anarchist nor a polygamist and that he renounced his loyalty to George V , king of England . The time I had with him was all too limited . Looking back , I 'm glad that I had severe childhood asthma and frequently missed school . When the attacks came , I 'd spend a good part of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asthma would ease off , and I 'd go downstairs to share brunch with him . A certain scent still reminds me of his shaving lotion . Phrases of songs he sang to me , off-key if my aunt Agnes was to be believed , still run through my mind . " Sunday night is my delight ... " That 's all I can remember . The rest of the words are gone . My memory of his physical appearance remains vivid , as I see a man just under six feet tall with thinning hair and a strong face . He had a quiet voice . " ' T is , dear , " was the way he would answer my questions in the affirmative . Like the brother and sister who came to the United States within a year or two of him , he did not have a brogue , just a few expressions and a lilt in his voice that was the gift of his Irish ancestry . Years ago I met an elderly cousin in London who had been raised in Ireland . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked like Luke when I was growing up , " he explained . " And as your granddad got older , he would call me Luke . Your dad was his favorite . " My father always intended to go back to Ireland , but he never made it . There was never that much time to get away from the bar and grill . On Sunday afternoons , he would come home to take us for a drive , and , further proof of our relative early prosperity , we had a summer cottage in Silver Beach Gardens , a small enclave on Long Island Sound at the tip of the east Bronx . The way to Silver Beach passed St. Raymond 's Cemetery . He would point out the flower shop adjacent to the cemetery . It had a small porch with an outdoor table . " And there , my dear , " he would remind me , " is the place where the ransom note for the baby was left . " The Crime of the Century . The kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath that table . We did have one memorable outing when I was five years old . My cousin Veronica had decided to become a nun , and we went to visit her in Tarrytown at the convent where she was a postulant . It was a snowy day , and the convent was at the top of a steep hill . The road was slick with ice , and the car started to slide backwards , weaving from side to side as it meandered with increasing speed down toward the busy road . Joseph and I were in the back seat , my mother in front . As my father frantically tried to regain control of the automobile , Mother cried , " Luke . Luke . Stop the car . Think of the children ! " " God almighty , Nora , " he barked . " Do you think this is my idea of driving ? " I remember standing in the backyard with him , shortly before he died , as he pointed to a dirigible floating overhead . It was the Hindenberg , and my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long distances . It exploded minutes later in one of the most famous disasters of the twentieth century , and I always claimed that I heard the explosion . But probably it was the sound of it on the radio report that became seared in my mind . " Sunday night is my delight ... " The rest of the song is gone . Just as I knew in those first moments as I raced up the stairs , ran down the hall into the bedroom , sank to my knees , and reached for his hand that Daddy was gone . Three days later , Eddy came down the block , the Good Humor bells jingling . He asked me why I was dressed up . I explained that we had been at my father 's funeral . He was shocked . " If I had known , I would n't have rung my bells on this block , " he said apologetically . Ask not for whom the bells toll  --  or do n't toll . My father had paid Social Security for his employees , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include employers . Mother tried to get a job , but she was sent home by the employment agencies . " We ca n't get work for college graduates , " they told her . " You 're fifty-two and have n't held a job in fourteen years . Go home and save your carfare . " That was when she put on her " thinking cap , " as she called it , and decided that the solution would be to rent rooms . Once more , I gave up my little room , and we all moved downstairs . The dining room was turned into a bedroom , and a divan was put in the living room . Mother reasoned that by renting the two big bedrooms for five dollars a week each , and my room for three dollars , we 'd make enough to cover the interest on the mortgage and taxes on the house . At that time so many people could no longer afford to amortize their mortgages that the banks had suspended their demand for payments . They did n't want all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since the car had been sold , she figured that we might be able to rent the garage for five dollars a month . In the meantime she would stretch the two thousand dollars in insurance money as far as possible . Joe turned thirteen the week after my father died . He took a newspaper route . Mother began baby-sitting , and so did I. There was a neighbor whose infant I happily minded as I tried to puzzle out the gossip I had heard that the neighbor had been " caught during the change . " Johnny volunteered to help clean out the garage to get it ready for a potential renter and ended up setting fire to it . It turned out to be a good fire . We got insurance money for the screens that were stored on the shelves in the back of the garage , along with several carpets and other odds and ends . Mother never would take a penny that was n't hers , but she believed passionately in the beauty and value of everything she owned . The results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-appreciated cash , which compensated her for her " good rugs . " She put a discreet sign next to the front door : FURNISHED ROOMS . KITCHEN PRIVILEGES . The neighbors did n't mind " Furnished Rooms . " But " Kitchen Privileges , " they hinted , brought down the tone of the neighborhood . Ever obliging , Mother cut the bottom half off the sign , thankful that she had n't wasted money on a metal sign that would have proved unalterable . She also put an ad in the Bronx Home News . The next day we waited for the phone to ring .
