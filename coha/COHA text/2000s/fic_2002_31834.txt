Chapter 17 Dark clouds stared down at me when I left the house this morning , but I got to school before the thunderstorm hit . Ms. Bobson brought in chocolate donuts and apple cider for a treat . " I thought this might help cheer up a gloomy fall morning , " she said . I think everyone knew the treats were also in honor of Buddy picking up a pencil for the first time yesterday . In art class Buddy painted a picture of a soccer field covered with giant soccer balls . If it was n't for the goalposts at each end of the field , I would have said it was a herd of cows in a pasture . Ms. Moberley made a big deal over it . " Buddy , your colors are wonderful , " she said . She must have patted him on the back ten times . Buddy did n't say anything , but I saw him smile a little . It was his first project in art class . The rain finally stopped by the end of school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for soccer practice . Buddy was standing on the sidewalk in his hunched over way when I came out of the building . I reached into my pocket for my keys . As I unlocked my bike , I felt a tap on the shoulder . " Well ? " Buddy 's voice was deeper than I expected , and it sounded baked and dry , just like his dad 's . When I turned to look at him , he had a funny expression on his face . I could n't tell if he was trying to smile or struggling not to . Either way , his lips were crooked . His eyes reminded me of Martha 's when she 's asking for a special favor . " Okay , " I said . " Let 's go . " Buddy did n't have a bike , so I walked mine back to his house to see his quartz collection . Buddy kept looking at my bike out of the corner of his eye . It 's a pretty cool saffron yellow mountain bike with left- and right-handed grip shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a ride ? " I asked . He smiled and climbed on . The bike was two sizes too big for him , but he did okay , except when he got to the corner of Broom Street . Buddy was trying so hard to keep his balance that he did n't see the traffic light change . " Watch out ! " I cried . The bike skidded to a stop with the help of a city mailbox . Buddy got up from the accident without a scratch , but my bike frame wound up with a blue streak that was not part of the paint job . " Sorry , " he said . " Do n't worry about it . " I shrugged . " The blue looks good , like a lightning bolt . " Buddy thought about it for a while , then nodded . Mr. White was sewing new soles on a pair of penny loafers when we walked into his shop . His hands were black with polish . A mound of shoes lay on a long table beside him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wiped his right hand across his apron and offered it to me . " Welcome . " " Thanks , " I said as we shook . " There 's a snack upstairs , " he said , then went back to what he was doing . With only Buddy and his dad around to take care of it , I expected the upstairs apartment to be sloppy , but it was the exact opposite . The living room carpet looked like it had just been vacuumed . The windows were spotless , and the magazines on the coffee table were stacked perfectly . The walls were bright yellow , a cheerful color that reminded me of Laura 's hellos . Two caramel apples waited on a square piece of wax paper in the kitchen . We sat at the table to eat them . My apple was humongous , and the caramel was so thick , it took me four bites to eat through it . I made a fish face when I bit into the tart fruit . Buddy smiled and did the same thing . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of our love for God . I thought the Whites would have crosses hanging on every wall , but I did n't see any . I wanted to ask Buddy why . I also wanted to ask him what it feels like to never celebrate holidays or birthdays , but I did n't think it would be a good idea . As soon as we finished eating the caramel apples , Buddy threw the sticks and wax paper away . " You ready to see my collection now ? " he asked . " Sure . " " Come on . " Buddy led me to his room , which was as neat as the rest of the house . His quartz collection had everything from rock crystal and milky quartz to agate , opal , and jasper , and I ca n't remember what else . There were more than a hundred different rocks and minerals . All of them were carefully mounted on shelves in egg cartons and shoe boxes that were open like books so I could see inside . Every specimen had a piece of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched file cards that had information about each specimen , like its color , its luster , its hardness , where Buddy found it , and when . Some of the handwriting looked like a kid 's , and some of it looked like an adult 's . " This is great , " I said . " Just like the geology museum downtown . " " My mom helped . " Buddy picked up a purple amethyst and held it in front of a lamp . Little specks of light glittered all over it like fireflies . " This was her favorite , " he said . " I knew your mom . " " I know . " Buddy put the amethyst back in its carton . I thought I 'd said something wrong . While Buddy straightened all the boxes on his shelves , even the ones that were already perfect , I pretended to study a piece of rose-colored onyx shaped like a half-moon . Suddenly , Buddy stopped what he was doing and looked at me . " After the accident , I thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself she was in Minnesota on vacation . " " Where do you think she is now ? " " With God . " " Up in heaven ? " " I do n't believe in heaven . " " Then where could she be ? " " In God 's memory . " " Where 's that ? " He shrugged . I tried to imagine God 's memory . The best picture I could come up with was the biggest computer in the universe , but I knew that was wrong . It was like trying to imagine eternity . How can you describe a place beyond space and time ? Mr. White came upstairs . He puttered around the kitchen before he called to us . We found him by the sink slicing onions . " I 'm making tuna casserole for dinner , " he said . " You want to join us , Sam ? " " I have to bike home before dark , " I said . " I can drive you . " " Thanks , but my mom 's expecting me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I did n't want to hurt his feelings , but I did n't feel like eating dinner with him and his dad . The three of us were still mostly strangers . I was relieved when Mr. White dropped the subject . A few minutes later Buddy walked me downstairs . " Thanks for the tour , " I said as I , " he said . " Do n't worry about it , " I told him . He sighed . " You were smart not to stay . " " Why ? " " Because we 'd only make you sad . " Then he shrugged and went back upstairs without saying good-bye .
