You can take the actor out of the movies , but you ca n't take the movies out of the actor . So when I ask Kiefer Sutherland how long his TV drama , 24 , can keep its edge , he reaches to the pictures for an analogy . " I thought Die Hard worked , and I thought Die Hard 2 worked , " he says carefully . " And I think they should have stopped it there . " <P> Sutherland 's worries are a reflection of the high bar the show set last year . It chronicled " the longest day " in the life of counterterrorist agent Jack Bauer ( Sutherland )  --  24 hours in which he had to foil the assassination of a presidential candidate while also trying to save his own wife and daughter from kidnappers . The show combined popcorn-movie thrills with a complicated and innovative narrative ( each episode was one hour in real time ) . And it confounded expectations right up to the end , when Bauer , after saving his daughter and the candidate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague . <P> Now Bauer  --  never the Kumbaya-singing type to begin with  --  is in a far darker place , which is right where Sutherland , 35 , wants him . Over an Atkins-y lunch at New York City 's W Union Square Hotel ( burger , medium rare ; hold the bun ) , he says , " I wanted him to be very cold . I wanted him to be very hard . I wanted him to be mean . " <P> Bauer is a good guy who carries himself like a bad guy , and Sutherland  --  known for playing heavies in movies like Stand By Me and The Lost Boys  --  plays him cold yet fiery , like a quart of vodka from the freezer . But 24 had to reintroduce Sutherland to an audience that remembered him as an ' 80s teen star who a decade later was better known for having been dumped by Julia Roberts . In the late ' 90s he even dropped out of acting to compete on the professional rodeo circuit ( he had learned roping for 1994 's The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " The first year was on purpose . The second year was to remind people who the f I was . " <P> 24 changed that quickly , as Sutherland brought home a Golden Globe award and an Emmy nomination for his first year 's work . The second season ( Fox , Tuesdays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) will put Bauer through another longest day of his life . How ? Last year I wrote that because of post-9/11 sensitivities , " one doubts that the second season might involve ... a nuclear bomb in New York City . " I 'm proud to say I was correct . The second season involves a nuclear bomb threat in Los Angeles . " Once you posit that the show is set in the world of antiterrorism , " says executive producer Robert Cochran , " you ca n't shy away from the things that people are afraid of . It 'd be like a cop show with no murders . " ( Also , 24 has gutsily kept its real-time format , which Fox feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
