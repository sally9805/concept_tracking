<p> In 1985 , investigators trying to learn why a Japan Air Lines 747 slammed into a mountain faced similar problems to those now afflicting the probe of the space shuttle Columbia disaster . <p> Despite reams of flight data , nothing could explain an explosion and sudden loss of control aboard the jet . As each day passed without an explanation , fears grew that the 747 had a hidden safety problem . Pressure mounted to ground all of the jets . <p> Then , in a pile of twisted metal at the bottom of a hill , an investigator found a ripped piece of sheet metal . This key piece of evidence became known as the " golden nugget . " To the forensics experts who ply the scorched wreckage of crash sites , the tears and cracks in the metal told the story . A botched repair job had triggered the crash , not an inherent flaw on the jet . <p> After nearly two weeks without a definitive explanation for why Columbia broke apart Feb. 1 , the investigation is turning to techniques pioneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detectives who tease clues from mangled bits of metal . <p> " Here we 've got the best telemetry vehicle in the world , the NASA shuttle . You 'd think the answer would be on a ( computer ) disk somewhere . But they do n't have it , " said Ronald Schleede , the U.S. accident investigator who found the torn piece of wreckage on that Japanese mountainside . Telemetry refers to the stream of data the shuttle sends to Earth stations that are monitoring its flight . <p> " They are not going to be able to solve it on a computer . They 've going to have to solve it by picking up the pieces , " Schleede said . <p> The task is unprecedented . Investigators have never had to assemble the wreckage of a vehicle that broke up at the upper reaches of the atmosphere . Already , 12,000 chunks of debris have been picked up in Texas and western Louisiana , and many thousands more remain . The wreckage is being brought to a hangar at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as 3,000 degrees may have burned or melted pieces of the shuttle . <p> But several senior accident investigators say they are confident that somewhere in the debris lie the clues that will explain what happened to Columbia . <p> One member of the board investigating the shuttle accident said Tuesday that many of the pieces appear recognizable . Few if any are burned or melted beyond recognition , said James Hallock , chief of the Transportation Department 's aviation safety division . <p> " There are pieces there that look surprisingly pristine , as well as pieces I have no idea what it would be , " Hallock said . <p> Inventive investigations <p> During the first decades of flight , there were no data recorders or computers . Witnesses were unreliable  --  if they did n't die in the accident . All investigators had was the wreckage on the ground . By necessity , the wreckage had to tell them what happened . <p> Accident investigators learned first to make sure that all pieces of the aircraft were present in a wreckage field . If pieces were missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that the plane had broken apart in flight . <p> They also figured out how to tell whether the engine was working when a plane crashed . If an engine had stopped and the propeller was n't moving , the propeller would bend differently than it would if it was spinning when it hit the ground . <p> At the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) in Washington , the types of innovation that drove the early accident investigators continue in a spare lab decorated with photos of burnt wreckage and enlargements of microscopic metal cracks . <p> Though such tasks as examining cracks in a jet engine have become routine , the metallurgists and structural engineers here are constantly inventing new tricks to solve riddles . <p> They can tell whether a light bulb was on or off at the instant a plane struck the ground . A bulb that has hot filament with electrical power running through it breaks differently than one with a cold filament . Investigators can see the difference under a microscope . <p> Even when a crash impact destroys cockpit gauges , clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the crash . In some cases , the needle on an altitude gauge leaves almost imperceptible indentations that indicate what it was reading at the time of impact . <p> Many modern aircraft now have electronic gauges that disintegrate on impact , but investigators can sometimes draw data from computer memory chips after a crash . <p> Tiny pieces , big conclusions <p> Putting together clues such as these has allowed accident investigators to solve some of the most mysterious crashes in history . <p> After TWA Flight 800 exploded shortly after takeoff and fell into the ocean off Long Island , N.Y. , in 1996 , investigators initially suspected that it had been bombed . But when crews started hauling the wreckage ashore , none of the pieces had the microscopic pitting that occurs with high explosives . <p> The wreckage told another story . Even though the 747 had blown up at 19,000 feet , descended in a ball of fire and slammed into the water , most pieces of the fuselage and aircraft skin were recognizable . <p> From the pattern of wreckage on the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the jet came from a fuel tank at the center of the fuselage . When they reassembled the tank , the dents and scratches on the frame showed how it broke apart . The NTSB concluded that fuel in the center tank had exploded and destroyed the jet . <p> Sometimes it has taken months to find the key piece of wreckage . In 1989 , a jet engine on United Airlines Flight 232 exploded over Iowa . The blast severed the hydraulics , which rendered the regular flight controls useless . By adjusting power in the two remaining engines , pilots nursed the DC-10 to Sioux Gateway Airport near Sioux City , Iowa , and crash-landed . The impact and fire killed 111 of the 296 people aboard . <p> Investigators knew that an engine failure had caused the accident , but without the broken engine pieces , they could not determine why . For months , they searched to no avail . <p> Three months after the accident , a farmer in Alta , Iowa , discovered the broken fan blades from the engine while plowing a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing that had allowed a crack to develop . Fan blades made years earlier from the same chunk of metal were replaced on other jets . <p> NTSB officials declined to comment on the shuttle accident because so many are assisting the investigation . About 20 NTSB employees are helping NASA in Texas , Florida and other locations , and several more are working on the investigation from Washington , spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said . <p> Whether the mystery of Columbia 's destruction can be solved is unclear . <p> Michael Marx , a former NTSB investigator who headed its materials lab , said the breakup in a fireball at 207,000 feet is something traditional aviation investigators have never seen before . <p> If heat melted metal components , that would have destroyed the clues investigators need . But if those parts survived and investigators can locate enough of them , they may be able to figure out what broke first and why , Marx said . <p> Encouraging signs <p> Though NASA 's collection of debris has proceeded fitfully at times , investigators familiar with the material say they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the keys in the TWA 800 investigation  --  could help pinpoint what broke first . Reconstructing the wreckage can help investigators visualize how structures broke apart . <p> Other data from the investigation , such as the report released Thursday indicating that superheated gas apparently penetrated the shuttle 's left wing on re-entry , will help tell forensics experts where to look . <p> John Purvis , who has spent 21 years investigating crashes with Boeing and as a consultant , said it may take months to locate a majority of the wreckage , but he 's betting that investigators will find out what happened . " You do a million things , you look at thousands of parts , and eventually one of them is the ' eureka ' piece , " he said . <p> Schleede , the former NTSB investigator who helped solve the Japan Air Lines crash , said , " I feel confident that the ' tin kickers ' can solve this thing .
