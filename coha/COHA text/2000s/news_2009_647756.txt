Lorraine Washington left her still-wrecked house in New Orleans East on Tuesday to seek the answer to a question that has plagued her every day since hurricane Katrina sank the Crescent City under a wall of water : Why ? <p> Her destination : Federal district court , where six plaintiffs are suing the US Army Corps of Engineers over the creation and maintenance of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet ( " Mr. GO " ) , a shipping channel that they say introduced fatal risk to a fragile levee-protection system . The government argues that the magnitude of the storm , by itself , caused the flooding of New Orleans , the deaths of more than 700 city residents , and $90 billion of damage across the region . <p> " I have to believe that justice is going to be received , that we 're going to be made whole again , " says Ms. Washington , an unemployed government clerk . She says she attended the trial in an attempt to finally understand the physical , geological , and political forces that created not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the plaintiffs - six hurricane survivors , including a local TV news anchor and his wife - in this " first real Katrina trial " could pave the way for a class-action lawsuit against the Corps , as well as set the tone for future US coastal policy . <p> But for many New Orleanians - especially those in the hard-hit St. Bernard Parish , New Orleans East , and the Lower Ninth Ward - the Mr. GO trial represents their own form of truth commission : It 's a chance not just to lay blame , but also to bridge what has been called a " deep gorge of distrust " between residents and the US agency charged with protecting them from the sea . <p> " Someone has to take responsibility , if only to make sure processes and policy are improved and grievances are addressed , " says Silas Lee , a sociologist at Xavier University in New Orleans , who adds that uncertainty over the city 's flood control has stymied the return of a third of the city 's residents . " People want closure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrina tore through New Orleans on a Monday morning . On Tuesday , as the sun shone and residents began to relax , water came pouring through the streets as high waters broke and overtopped levees . <p> In the Lower Ninth Ward , Jimmy Braxton 's sister climbed with her two small kids into the attic . Holding the kids , she craned for air as the water rose . Another relative swam to the house and busted through the roof . She had to let go of one of the kids to reach through the hole . Only one child survived . <p> Today , Mr. Braxton lives with that image - and his sister 's choice - every day . The fact that a favorable verdict in the Mr. GO case could mean a future class-action lawsuit - possibly with cash damages for residents - does n't assuage him . <p> " How can you pay us for my family 's loss or put a price on these scars ? " said Braxton , a graying , lanky black man standing on a deserted street in the Lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world can heal the pain and suffering " of watching the storm 's devastation . <p> At the same time , he adds , " If the Corps did n't do its job , somebody should be held responsible . Somebody 's got to answer to something . " <p> At stake in the trial is between $10 billion and $100 billion in possible damages , on top of the $107 billion that US taxpayers have already poured into the rebuilding of New Orleans and the devastated Mississippi Gulf Coast . <p> The federal Flood Control Act gives the Corps broad immunity and discretion , acknowledging the unforeseen risks that are implicit when people carve into the natural environment . But by allowing the case to go to court , the judge in the Mr. GO case rejected the Corps assertions of " sovereign immunity " from lawsuits involving floods . <p> " If successful , this case will set the tone for the future and enable people in St. Bernard Parish , New Orleans East , and the Lower Ninth Ward to seek redress for damages for what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attorneys for the plaintiffs . <p> Created in the 1960s - a decade , according to testimony , when the motto was " build anything " - the Mr. GO canal provided an alternate and shorter route for cargo ships from New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico . <p> But the channel , coastal geologists have testified in this case , also increased salinity in the storm-slowing swamps , marshes , and tupelo stands that protected New Orleans east side , killing much of the vegetation . And it created a " great pipe " to move storm surges straight into the city . After 30 years of warnings , the Corps in the late 1990s began moving to close Mr. GO but " dragged its heels , " according to Sherwood Gagliano , an expert witness . <p> Duke geologist Orrin Pilkey , who has written several books about the Corps , says the Mr. GO trial could determine Washington 's liability for a piecemeal coastal policy - and serve notice to Congress that a " major societal debate " needs to take place about the Corps role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the effects of sea-level rise . <p> " For me , the best outcome would not be monetary , but forcing a change " in the Corps unusual funding arrangement with Congress , says Mr. Pilkey . The Corps is the only US agency that relies entirely on earmarks - or " pork-barrel " funding - for its budgetary survival , creating , in Pilkey 's view , an unhealthy relationship that undermines the Corps ability to plan and make sensible recommendations . <p> Nationally , the Mr. GO case could inspire a bevy of lawsuits against the government and the Corps , also forcing Congress to get involved , says Erich Rapp , a Baton Rouge-based lawyer who blogs on coastal issues . A middle position would be for Congress to ask the US Court of Federal Claims " to look at the federal government 's culpability " in preventing disasters like Katrina , Mr. Rapp says . <p> Then 79 years old , Harold Brehmer traversed the worst-flooded parts of St. Bernard Parish for three days after Katrina , at one point getting lost and climbing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how huge water spouts came out of the sewers and " water came down the streets at 100 miles per hour . " For three days , his family thought he was dead . <p> Today , Mr. Brehmer is one of tens , perhaps hundreds , of thousands of people who could be eligible for damages if federal district judge Stanwood Duval finds the Corps exhibited clear negligence in the building and maintenance of Mr. GO . Brehmer had to spend more than $20,000 of his own money to fix his small house in Chalmette , not counting heaps of charity help . <p> Though he plans to join a class-action lawsuit , his worldview remains sanguine . <p> " I 'm not angry , " he says .
