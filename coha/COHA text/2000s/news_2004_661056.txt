<p> If it 's Mexican art , it must depict strong , noble peasants at work in the fields . Or , perhaps Australian art - surely , that will mean Aboriginal handiwork . Native American art means clay pots and elegant rugs . Right ? These are just a few of the hoary stereotypes that artists from emerging countries find themselves stubbornly fighting , even today , in an era of lightning-swift communication between distant countries and cultures . <p> Artists have always struggled to be seen as individuals rather than stereotypes . But now this desire is receiving increased institutional support . As a result of cultural and economic shifts in the art world , exploding globalism , and the high costs of more traditional shows , a growing number of exhibitions both in the US and abroad are devoted to replacing cliched preconceptions with the vital , modern work of contemporary artists from a wide variety of cultures . <p> " Artists in every country have always tried to tell their own story , " says Russell Ferguson , curator at the UCLA Hammer Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition showcasing the work of contemporary Mexican art . " The question has always been : ' What do people in the more dominant countries want to receive from that country ? ' " <p> The changing economics of museums have opened the door of opportunity , say some observers . " It 's getting more popular to do traveling shows that are more indigenous in nature , " says Arthur Brooks , associate professor of public administration at Syracuse University 's Maxwell School . The arts and culture specialist says that as security costs , as well as loan and travel costs , have made blockbuster shows prohibitively expensive , museums have been searching out the smaller , more unusual shows to attract audiences . <p> " One way to do that is to look at developing countries . If you have a population that 's interested in coming to the museums , you can get a high-quality traveling exhibition for a fraction of the cost of a Monet , " says Professor Brooks . <p> The title of the Hammer show is intentionally ironic . It aims to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs of Daniela Rossell , depicting a decadent upper class at play in its luxurious mansions , or the sculptures of Damian Ortega , created from industrial materials , reveal a vital , modern art world south of the US border that shatters traditional stereotypes about " native art . " <p> Artists have always struggled to balance cultural identity with personal vision , says Gilbert Vicario , curator of " Made in Mexico . " Now , that impulse has only become more difficult as free trade and instant global communications have eroded the concept of an insular , national identity . <p> The show also explores the effect of Mexican artists on other cultures . <p> " I decided to play with the notion of art and nationalism and nationality , " says Mr. Vicario , pointing to his inclusion of nonMexicans such as Japanese artist Yasumasa Morimura , whose career has been devoted to exploring the images of Frida Kahlo . His work , as well as that of others , explores what happens when artists from all sorts of backgrounds and nationalities make art that is inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real message behind the exhibition is that everything in the art world is much more complicated than anyone wants to think , but there are lots of people who do n't want to take the time to sort it out , " says Vicario . " These ideas from each country are up for grabs , " he adds , " and the works become more powerful because they transcend geographic and cultural borders . " <p> ' Our little neighbor to the south ' <p> Even smaller museums with permanent collections devoted to niches such as Latin , native American , or African-American art find themselves fighting similar cultural battles . <p> Gregorio Luke , now director of the Museum of Latin American Art ( MoLAA ) in Long Beach , Calif. , used to work as a promoter of a Mexican dance troupe . " Everybody expected us to do folklorica . It was very hard to do Bach . We did n't want to just go out and do another hat dance , " he says . " This is true for everyone , not just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means that if you 're from Argentina , you have to tango ; or from Spain you have to do flamenco ; or Australians have to pull out a crocodile and Africans have to do some sort of banana dance . " <p> Americans , despite their proximity to Mexico , are constantly being " reintroduced to more modern ideas of Mexican art , " says Vicario . This desire to push through that limited notion was yet another motivation for assembling the show , which originated in Boston . Even in that sophisticated city , Vicario faced familiar biases . " All I kept hearing from my director in Boston , a supposedly very liberal person , was ' The show 's not colorful enough ; give me more colors , ' and also , ' No video . ' " It shakes your foundation , he says , " to consider a broad range of works such as these , when what you 're comfortable with is the idea of the ' noble savage ' or ' our little neighbor to the south . ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen in any country . " I also encountered just as much resistance in Mexico City . People said to me , ' You have to get rid of that title . ' They did n't grasp the ironic intent . " <p> But Mr. Luke says people are receptive to a more complex vision . <p> " There is a growing interest in a more sophisticated Mexican culture , " he says . " We 've brought in sophisticated art and dance , we do n't even have any folk art , and people are coming in droves . " <p> Mexican artists surge forward <p> If the clusters of attendees for the Hammer show are any indication , the art is opening more than a few eyes . " I always thought of Mexico being backward in the art department , " says Stephanie Young , sitting with her friends . She says she came from El Segundo , a town southwest of L.A. , to see the show . " But I 'm really impressed by how forward-thinking they all seem to be , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolly mammoth , covered in plastic Hostess cupcakes , " both in their techniques and their concerns , " she adds , and her friends nod in agreement . <p> " I learned all about the Cinco de Mayo from that sign , " says Willy , an elderly African-American , touring the works with his Spanish teacher . He takes a language class for seniors at a local high school . The group has come to the show in hopes of learning some Spanish as well as something about Mexican culture . The teacher appears frustrated at the contemporary , conceptual nature of the works , having hoped for more traditional pieces . <p> But Willy is happy . He says he sees the metaphor for the artists ' struggle in more than a few of the works and points to a series of photos of a man being fenced in with glass partitions , separated from cultural artifacts in a natural history museum . <p> " See the guy there ? " he points to the man who is crouching inside the glass barrier , " he 's behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up by the museum . " <p> He smiles at his own understanding of the art , looks around for his class which has moved on . " Excuse me , " he says , politely , " but I do n't want to miss any of the art . " <p> * Current exhibitions of indigenous art around the US and internationally that move beyond folk images include : " Our Place : Indigenous Australia Now " at the Benaki Contemporary Art Museum in Athens , part of the cultural Olympiad through August ; " African American Masters " at the Delaware Art Museum in Wilmington through Sept. 5 ; and " Art of the Americas : Latin America and the United States , 1800 to Now !
