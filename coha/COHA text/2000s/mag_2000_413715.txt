// In early August , Bert Ammons of Stuart , Florida pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act when he attempted to smuggle ninety 30-pound cylinders of CFC-12 , also known by its trade name , Freon , in false compartments on his 41-foot boat , Sierra . According to Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) officials , not only did Ammons plan to distribute the chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) to auto repair shops around Fort Lauderdale , but his ozone-depleting cargo also had a street value of approximately $68,000 . If convicted , Ammons faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines . With millions of dollars in evaded taxes and illegal contraband , not to mention multi-agency federal initiatives with names like " Operation Cool Breeze , " its a wonder no one has written a Hollywood thriller about refrigerant and fire-suppressant smugglers . But what illegal CFCs lack in cultural cachet , they make up for in volume and profitability . Between 1994 and 1997 , 6,367 tons of CFC- 12 and 24 tons of CFC- 113 ( used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That comes to $43 million in attempted tax evasion alone . According to an unnamed official in the EPAs Criminal Enforcement Division , illegal CFCs rank close to cocaine as some of the most profitable contraband coming across the U.S. border . The public may not be aware of it , but " black market CFC smuggling is considered a serious problem , " says Jack McQuade , an officer with the U.S. Customs Service . Over the past 10 years , 173 countries including the U.S. have signed the landmark Montreal Protocol of 1987 , a global agreement to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals . But the persistent trade in illegal CFCs is only one sign that ozone recovery is far from a sure thing . Recent scientific findings link global warming to ozone depletion , challenging prevailing assumptions that the ozone hole will begin to recover by the year 2050 . In October , a major ozone hole opened for the first time over a populated city , Punta Arenas , Chile . " Policy makers on down say : We solved the ozone layer problem . What 's next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ozone Action , a Washington D.C.-based public interest group . " We did the easy thing : We got rid of the CFCs . But when you try to get people to talk about methyl bromide and ozone depletion , about global warming and ozone depletion , it 's like pulling teeth . " DECLARING VICTORY ? No one disputes that stratospheric ozone recovery is one of the environmental movement 's great success stories . In the 1970s , scientists first discovered that CFCs and other chemicals could damage the Earth 's protective ozone layer , which shields life on Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation . These concerns were substantiated in the 1980s by the discovery of the " ozone hole , " a thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica . Additional studies showed that ozone depletion and the corresponding increase in UNI radiation hitting the Earth 's surface , can have serious consequences for human health and the environment . Incorporating science , technology and economics , the Montreal Protocol laid out timetables for every country to phase out production of CFCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act to comply with treaty goals . The scientific community was also charged with re-evaluating the treaty and making amendments accordingly . In 1987 , for example , the Protocol called only for a partial phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals . But re-evaluations in 1989 resulted in a total phase-out of CFCs . Additional assessments in the 1990s led to a dramatic acceleration of the phase-out of the new chemicals , hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) and methyl bromide . " The ozone depletion issue is a good example of the no-net  --  harm principle combined with the precautionary principle-acting on our knowledge when we have the presumption of a problem , " says Davies . " We discovered this hole , we thought there was a link to CFCs and we started moving . " The time it takes to get the ball rolling on an international treaty is so great , says Davies , that by the time the Protocol was in place , scientists knew even more about ozone depletion and were able to act accordingly . At the beginning of the 21st century , experts agree that a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the Protocol 's latest scientific assessment , the world in 2050 , absent the global agreement , would look like this : Ozone depletion would be at least 50 percent at mid latitudes . Surface ultraviolet radiation would double at mid latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and quadruple at mid latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere . By the year 2060 , there would be 19 million more cases of non-melanoma skin cancer and 1.5 million more cases of melanoma skin cancer . And then there would be the numerous unquantifiable effects , such as loss of immunity , lower productivity of crops and damage to aquatic ecosystems . " The kind of global disaster we averted ... is indescribable , " says John Passacantando , the former executive director of Ozone Action , now head of Greenpeace USA . " Had we not phased out this stuff , there would be so much chlorine in the stratosphere it would be like the scene of a bad movie . " But temporarily thwarting apocalypse , experts caution , is no cause for complacency . According to the World Meteorological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antarctica was larger and deeper than ever before measured ; at 27 million square miles , it covered a surface area larger than North America . The ozone hole over the Arctic also deepened this year , with potentially far more damaging effects on human health . Photograph The thinning of the ozone layer , as graphically depicted at left , has led to an abrupt rise in skin cancer cases in affected areas , spurring sales of umbrellas and sunblock. // The continued threat to the ozone layer can be explained in both political and scientific terms . Under the Montreal Protocol , developing countries have delayed timetables for ending production of ozone-depleting chemicals . Although industrialized countries were required to phase out CFCs by 1996 and methyl bromide by 2005 , developing countries have until 2010 to phase out CFCs and until 2015 to phase out methyl bromide . " The consumption of these chemicals in developing countries is still somewhere around 200,000 tons , " says Dr. Omar ElArini , chief officer of the United Nations Multilateral Fund Secretariat in Montreal , which was established in 1990 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ozone layer will not recover without the participation of developing nations , he says . " There is only one sky and one ozone layer , which can not be partitioned . " PSST , WAN NA BUY SOME ... OZONE ? Here 's where the flourishing trade in illegal refrigerant comes in : CFC production not only continues in developing countries , it is dirt cheap to buy . Sources in the EPA 's criminal enforcement division say that in Mexico and China ( among other developing nations ) , CFC- 12 can be bought for $1 or $2 a pound and resold in the U.S for $20 or $25 a pound . Why the huge domestic markup ? It 's a simple matter of supply and demand . With some exceptions for medical use , and use in space shuttle equipment , the United States banned the import of CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals in 1996 . However , millions of pieces of equipment that use CFCs are still in service , including most automobiles built before 1994 , air conditioners and other refrigeration equipment . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be serviced with ozone-friendly alternatives , costs can run anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of dollars . Contributing to the problem , the U.S. and other industrialized countries allow the trade and use of recycled CFCs to maintain existing machinery . Because it 's almost impossible to distinguish between new and recycled Freon , traders illegally bring CFCs into industrialized countries in the guise of recycled substances or exports to developing countries . A high excise tax on the sale or use of CFCs in the U.S. ( $5.35 per pound ) also abets the illegal trade . EPA and Customs Service officers say it 's impossible to estimate the quantity of illegal CFCs crossing the border . Nonetheless , the scope of the black market is startling . From Russia to Australia , federal officials paint a picture of worldwide CFC smuggling operations that run the gamut from small-time entrepreneurs to sophisticated money laundering conspiracies . Photograph Scientists study Antarctic water samples to measure the effects of increased ultraviolet light exposure . A negative effect on plankton growth is already apparent . Photograph India is one source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and air conditioners . Smugglers can buy CFC-12 for $1 a pound and sell it illegally in the U.S. for $20 to $25 a pound . // Since the launch of a nationwide CFC enforcement initiative in 1995 , which involves the United States Customs Service , the EPA , the FBI and the IRS , over 100 individuals have been convicted for violation of customs law and the federal Clean Air Act . Defendants included Richard Schmolke , who was convicted last year for a scheme to illegally import 75,000 pounds of CFC- 12 from Venezuela into Texas . Agents said that Schmolke was part of one of the largest Freon smuggling rings they had ever encountered . Federal officials anticipate an increase in smuggling activity as the supply of legal CFCs is depleted by the end of this year , said Jack McQuade of the U.S. Customs Service . As of last July , a total of 5,438 pounds of CFC- 12 had been seized along the southern border and 2,700 pounds of CFC- 12 had been taken in the south Florida area , he says . The reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , the U.S. Customs Service regularly intercepted " frio banditos " coming across the Rio Grande , all with cylinders of CFCs strapped to their backs . Geographically , this is the frontline for new smuggling rings . " There are indications that consolidation of individually smuggled CFCs is now occurring along the U.S./Mexican border , " says McQuade . Until older cars get off the road , and until developing countries stop producing CFCs , say EPA officials , CFC smuggling will continue . A related problem , according to EI-Arini , is that industrialized countries are dumping CFC-containing products and equipment on developing nations . This will further complicate efforts by developing countries to comply with the Montreal Protocol , he says . Despite widespread " cheating " and smuggling , the global effort to restore the ozone layer is a remarkable achievement , especially when viewed from an international political perspective . The Multilateral Fund , for example , helped the majority of developing countries freeze production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances at 1999 levels-the first Protocol obligation for these countries . Since 1991 , the Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption of 142,000 tons of ozone-depleting chemicals in over 110 developing countries . " This is the first real-life endeavor of mankind to join hands to solve environmental damage that threatens our common habitat , the Earth , " says El-Arini . " It proves that once the political commitment is there , national borders can be crossed to overcome a problem of a global dimension . " TROUBLE AT HOME Back at home , those familiar with the political scene are n't quite so sanguine . This year , the U.S. is headed for a showdown over methyl bromide , a toxic ozone-depleting chemical used in this country primarily by California strawberry and Florida tomato growers . Introduced last spring by California Congressman Richard Pombo , the un-ironically titled Methyl Bromide Fairness Act would push back the U.S. phase-out date to 2015-the year developing countries are required to stop production and consumption of the chemical . Due to its acute toxicity , methyl bromide is already banned in several countries , including the Netherlands and Canada . For years , environmentalists and health officials in the U.S. ( which uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for stricter regulation of the pesticide , especially in agricultural areas such as California 's Ventura County , where children and farm workers are at risk . Since 1982 , nearly 500 poisonings linked to methyl bromide have occurred in California , 19 of them fatal . The best account of methyl bromide 's tarnished history in American politics can be found in a report published by the Transnational Resource and Action Center ( TRAC ) and the Political Ecology Group ( PEG ) in 1997 . Titled " Bromide Barons : Methyl Bromide , Corporate Power and Environmental Justice , " the report meticulously documents how the Big Three methyl bromide corporations , Albemarle , Great Lakes Chemical and Dead Sea Bromine , as well as California-based TriCal , the largest applicator of methyl bromide in the state , have systematically worked to roll back environmental regulations that threaten profit margins . " Through various industry groups , " the report states , " including the Methyl Bromide Global Coalition and the Methyl Bromide Working Group , the bromide barons have hindered the development of alternatives to methyl bromide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributes to ozone depletion , and influenced the political process through lobbying . " Photograph U.S. Senator John McCain 's skin cancer was treated during his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination . Without a CFC treaty , the world would experience 1.5 million new cases of melanoma by 2060. // Ozone Hole Size ( Sept. 7-Oct. 13 avg. ) // In 1998 , industry-backed congressional representatives tried - and failed-to pass a bill that would push back the phase-out date of methyl bromide . With an environmental rider to the 1999 budget , they succeeded : the date was bumped four years to 2005 . Now it 's round three . At a House Agriculture Subcommittee hearing last July on the Methyl Bromide Fairness Act ( which now has more than 20 sponsors ) , efforts to undermine the methyl bromide ban were relentless . " While methyl bromide has been placed in the position of public enemy number one by the radical environmental community , we have lost sight of the fact that this may truly be a silver bullet compound , " excoriated Jim Culbertson , executive manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not falling and agricultural methyl bromide is not the cause of the ozone hole . " Claims that methyl bromide has a negligible effect on ozone depletion are simply not true , counters Azadeh Tabazadeh , an atmospheric chemist at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View , California . " In fact , the bromine in methyl bromide is a much better catalyst for ozone destruction than chlorine , " she says . " And just because we 've reduced the amount of chlorine in the atmosphere does n't mean that the level of bromine is also going down . That 's why compounds like methyl bromide need to be regulated . " The government and scientific community agree . The EPA identifies methyl bromide as a Class I ozone-depleting substance that will be phased out under the Clean Air Act . A 1994 paper , coauthored by several federal agencies and the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , warns that with the phase-out of CFCs underway , the elimination of methyl bromide emissions " from agricultural , structural , and industrial activities " is the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce future levels of ozone depletion . Case studies listed by the EPA demonstrate that viable chemical and organic substitutes for methyl bromide do exist . " Farmers are reluctant to change because their crop production systems have been developed around methyl bromide , " says Bill Thomas of the EPAs Stratospheric Protection Division . " But a number of good alternatives to methyl bromide are now available , which should allow most growers to continue to produce their crops in a way they 're used to " FEEDING THE LOOP As U.S. special interests backpedal on methyl bromide , recent discoveries about ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere are forcing scientists to revise earlier claims that the ozone layer will begin to recover by 2050 . Although satellites have detected an ozone " cavity " over the Arctic for several years , the phenomenon is growing worse . From November 1999 through March 2000 , seasonal ozone concentrations in some parts of the Arctic declined as much as 60 percent . From a human health perspective , Arctic ozone thinning is more worrisome than comparable reductions over Antarctica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each spring toward highly populated areas in North America , Europe and Russia . Last year , a European Space Agency 's satellite revealed that ozone levels in Great Britain , Belgium , Netherlands and Scandinavia were nearly as low as those normally found in the Antarctic . There 's another reason why the ozone hole over the Arctic is attracting attention . Scientists have known for some time that ozone lows are often associated with extremely low temperatures in the stratosphere and the presence of polar stratospheric clouds , which provide the template for the chemical reactions that destroy ozone . Polar clouds are also a common presence in the Antarctic , where temperatures are colder than the Arctic . Here 's the key finding : Over the past couple of decades , the Arctic has become more like the Antarctic ; in other words , it 's getting a lot colder . And as recent studies published in the journal Science suggest , global warming may be the culprit . " It 's ironic because people have always been confused about ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect- the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And now it turns out they are . " Photograph ENVIRONMENTALISTS WANT TO FORCE A SHOWDOWN OVER AGRICULTURAL USE OF THE OZONE DEPLETER METHYL BROMIDE . // The feedback loop between global warming and ozone depletion works like this : The warming of the lower atmosphere known as the greenhouse effect traps warm air at the surface . This in turn leads to cooling in the upper atmosphere , which creates the conditions for ozone depletion to take place . CFCs , which deplete ozone , are also a culprit in global warming . Scientists used to believe that as chlorine levels declined in the upper atmosphere , the ozone layer would start to recover , says Tabazadeh , who co-authored a recent study on the role polar clouds assume in ozone depletion . " That would be true only if the climate was persistently the same , " she says . " But if the climate is getting colder due to surface warming , the upper atmosphere is primed for massive destruction of ozone . Things are going to get worse before they get better . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political problems-namely , what to do about hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) . HFCs were originally introduced as an ozone-friendly alternative to CFCs ; however , they are now recognized as a powerful greenhouse gas , with as much as 4,000 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide ( COz ) . So far , the HFC issue has underscored tensions between groups concerned about global warming and groups working toward ozone recovery . For example , this year Coca-Cola announced plans to phase out the use of HFCs in its cold-drink equipment . The move was applauded by environmental groups like Greenpeace but criticized by industry groups such as the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy , which said it would threaten the ozone layer as well as the economic competitiveness of companies that have invested millions in HFC technology . The fight to protect the ozone layer has become a model for global environmental protection . But as the continuing battle over methyl bromide , the illegal trade in CFCs and now the controversy over HFCs suggest , environmental memory is not only short term-it can also be short-circuited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to be seen . " The atmosphere has the potential to be the big wake-up call on the environment , " says Davies . " Because the more we look , the more we see that all these issues are connected . The atmosphere is the ultimate global commons . " <p>
