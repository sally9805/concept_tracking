Headnote MIND YOUR BODY ) AN ANCIENT TRADITION , YOGA GAINS SOME MODERN MUSCLE . BY PAUL TULLIS AFTER THE TSUNAMI ripped through Southeast Asia in 2004 came a tidal wave of psychic devastation . The depression and posttraumatic stress that ravaged many residents of coastal villages from India to Indonesia provided a living laboratory for testing the most powerful cures available . What wound up providing the best help to some of the most afflicted refugees ? Yoga . Yoga is an age-old practice with roots in India-bas-reliefs depicting yoga asanas , or poses , have been found on 5,000-year-old archeological artifacts-but yoga as most Americans know it is only part of the picture . The hatha yoga popular here emphasizes the exercise element There are many forms of yoga and all share an attempt to create a state of blissful enlightenment , called ananda . En route , specific forms of breathing and exercises encourage physical purification . As a professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College who studies the effects of yoga on posttraumatic stress , Patricia Gerbarg seized the opportunity to test whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of 60 victims she gave a four-day yoga breathing course . Another group of 60 survivors was given the yoga course along with psychological counseling . A third group served as controls . All the yoga users experienced a huge drop in scores for posttraumatic stress disorder and depression after just four days . And the effect was so persistent that Gerbarg and her team introduced yoga to those in the control group too . Counseling provided no added benefits over the yoga training alone . While some forms of yoga have long been shown to reduce hypertension , cholesterol levels , and other signs of physiological stress , the effects of the ancient practice on psychological stress have been less studied . But a slew of recent research published in peer-reviewed journals in the U.S. , Europe , and India is documenting the ability of yoga to decrease mood disturbance , reduce psychic stress and anxiety , and reduce PTSD symptoms . Effects have been seen within days of initiating instruction , and have been documented up to six months after a course of yoga training . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical diagnosis to benefit from yoga , says Lorenzo Cohen , director of the Integrative Medicine Program at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston . Calling it " the quintessential mind-body practice , " Cohen predicts that yoga " can and will be shown to be helpful for managing the stress and mild anxiety we all experience in daily living . " A group of healthy senior citizens in Oregon embodies Cohen 's claims . They experienced improved energy and a greater sense of well-being after six months of yoga training . The study was particularly valuable because it compared the yoga group with seniors engaging in walking exercise classes . The non-yoga exercisers reported no such benefit . In heryoga course , Gerbarg trains trauma sufferers in four types of yogic breathing that range from focusing on slow , complete exhalation to taking 30 breaths a minute . She and her husband , psychopharmacologist P.L. Brown of Columbia University , have found that yogic breathing physiologically affects the nervous system to produce profound changes in emotional states . It acts via the vagus nerve-the " rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomic nervous system extending from brain stem to abdomen ; when activated , it slows down breathing and heart rate and increases intestinal activity . It not only carries signals from brain to body but ferries signals from the body back to the brain . " Your breathing pattern changes with emotional reactions to things , " Gerbarg says . " Well , it goes both ways : If you change your breathing pattern , you can change your emotions . " Lynn Waelde , a psychologist at Stanford University and a yoga teacher , explains yoga 's mind-body benefits in more metaphorical terms . " When we teach yoga , we teach people to let go of physical tensions , " she says . " When you sit them in a chair in meditation , they get it . It 's an easy step to see how you can breathe and focus on emotional or mental tension and let it go . " Could yoga save the world ? It improves fitness , it does n't cost anything , it has minimal side effects , it acts quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied on a large scale to impoverished people . Gerbarg and Cohen believe the value of yoga is just beginning to be documented . " We 're in the early phases of something very exciting , and there 's a lot more to learn about it , " Gerbarg says . " This is not something you need to religiously incorporate into your daily life and do for years before you start to feel the benefits . " Sidebar SELF-HEALER Seane Corn , a California-based yoga instructor who gives workshops around the world , credits yoga for saving her from her obsessive compulsive disorder . " It took a couple of years and a lot of yoga , but I was able to free myself , " Corn says . " There 's a yoga out there for everyone , and thank God for it .
