He was n't her first lover , or her best lover , or even her lover at first . He was too gangly , for one thing . There was nothing but leg connecting his chin to his shoes , so it was awkward for her always to be craning up to look at him . Except when he sat down ; then , because he tended to slouch , and because his limbs were so long , he seemed shorter . That was how she preferred being with him , and for a while , whenever he visited her at her woodsy home on the edge of town , she immediately sat him down someplace , so they could be at equal eye level . First she took his coat and hung it up neatly on a hanger , because he was fastidious in the extreme about his clothes , even going so far as to pack tissue in the sleeves of his shirts when he traveled . Then she would offer him a glass of white wine , which he invariably declined , It bothered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flamboyance or novelty of the name , not because she knew anything whatsoever about wine . At that point , she always led him over to the orange corduroy couch which he found oddly professorial , like one of her ex-husband 's old jackets minus the suede patch on the elbow , sat him down and simply threw herself at him , kissing him with such fury that it surprised both of them . I love how hungry you get , he would say , as she ran her hands through his hair and felt the muscles through his shirt and kept kissing him as if she were falling down a well . If it were possible to leave her own body and post herself into his just by pressing hard enough against his chest , she would have . That was how close she wanted to be to him . <p> " They 'd find us stuck together like two postage stamps somebody spilled coffee on , " she once said . <p> " Sounds romantic , " he said flatly . <p> " Let me change the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air " They would find us like two Siamese twins joined forever at the hips " ' <p> " Kinky , but better . Do n't you ever do things simply ? " <p> She never did do things simply , especially think simply , and there were times when living by Technicolor even wore her out . What he could n't figure was why her house was so boring when her mind was so busy . Some of her artworks were up on the walls , like the rya rugs she hooked after patterns she had seen through a scanning electron microscope , and an abstract black and white wash of milk bottles that hung in the kitchen , but mainly the walls were bare . Her furniture was academic and bland  --  all earth tones and corduroys . This he attributed to her ex-husband , a professor , He knew she had a very frilly interior , which she showed him among other ways in the lace garter belts and underwear she always wore when she expected him . I love that you wore that for me , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavender stockings without running them . But secretly he feared that part of her must be as oblivious to her surroundings as her house suggested . Otherwise how could she live like that , with a loud mangy green shag rug that needed repair in two places , and hallway linoleum that still bore the initial of the previous tenant ? After eight years , you never changed the " L " ? he had asked her . But she had never gotten round to it , and her husband had n't cared really . He just covered it up with a brown throw rug ; out of sight was out of mind . Her lover , on the other hand , was as meticulous in his choice of furnishings as he was in his dress or in the way he signed his name or in his pronunciation of French with just the right amount of nasal disdain and roaming saliva . Haft the time , she was like that , too : disciplined , self-willed , a workaholic , brimming with tidiness and self-mastery . But the other half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions and senses , and really quite oblivious to time and place as she devoured life sensation by sensation . She was n't sure which side of her he found attractive . But there he was , often when his colleagues thought he was off doing fieldwork , as did his wife in Manhattan . There were his calls at odd moments of each day . I bet you tend fires well , too , she once said to him . And there were days when there was nothing that did n't remind her of him , of their secret language together , of the sensual stampede of their lovemaking . <p> Altogether , they 'd been heavily involved for ten weeks , which did n't seem like a very long time , when she thought about it . She remembered how they 'd first met by telephone , when he 'd phoned her about a surprise fortieth birthday party for a mutual friend , and how talking into the small perforations of the receiver , they were instantly on the same wavelength , at once so open and rompy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they met for lunch soon afterwards , they stayed talking until every other person in the restaurant had left , long into the afternoon , talking about nothing , about everything . <p> One day , after the birthday party , he asked if he could stop by with a video of a musical she 'd wished to see but could n't find at any of the outlets in the city . My neighbors are home , people will talk , she 'd said to him almost the second the door opened . They talk , anyway , it 's one of the things people do , like breathe , he said . Then , in an excess of nervousness , because she still was n't sure what was going to happen , or what she wished to happen , she gave him a tour of the house , from the lackluster professorial living room with its corduroy furniture to the laundry room and kitchen , discreetly omitting the bedroom , but including almost every book in the bookcase , every knickknack and record . When he finally could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large photographic diary of Leni Riefenstahl 's sojourn among the Bantu out of her hands , put it down on a table , and kissed her with exquisite tenderness for what seemed ages . That was how the brushfire of their romance began , and for ten weeks it blazed daily in one way or another , depending on whether they could get together , through the mail or by telephone or in each other 's arms . She was always cheerful and full of excitement about life , so he called her his little hummingbird , even though she was much too zaftig for such an image . She had n't chosen a totemic animal for him yet , but she promised that when she did , she would meet him at the Bronx Zoo and celebrate with kisses and animal crackers . <p> He was considerably older than she was , which she often told herself ; although she never mentioned it when she was with him . This bothered her for two reasons : First , he only ever seemed to have experienced what she was experiencing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done . Only more so . Where were you in 1949 ? she once asked him . When he answered New York , she explained that she 'd asked because there was a little-known musical by Heitor Villa-Lobos , her favorite composer , on Broadway at that time , and she wondered what the score was like . Magdalena , he had said , knowing at once the title of the musical , and even adding that Bloomingdale 's windows were full of Rio wares during its brief run . There was nothing more irritating than trying to show one 's esoteric cultural knowledge only to be sucker-punched by someone with better trivia . But she also loved his having lived so much more than she . Second , she knew he would not leave his wife for her or anyone , and furthermore that he would die long before her , as morbid as that thought was , and as previous . After all , he was n't her lover at all at first , only a serious infatuation ; and she could get run over by a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger man was n't protected from life , either . So she never mentioned her lover 's age to him except restoratively , complimenting him elaborately when they made love , or telling him on his birthday : Pablo Casals is twenty years older than you are , Just think about how much mischief you could get up to in the next twenty years . <p> By that time she had already fallen for him hook , line , sinker , fire truck , and Mercator projection . She longed for their intimate times together , when they gazed into each other 's eyes like teenagers and could n't keep their hands off of each other when they were dining out . He was as real a fact in her life as the sun . Her days began and ended thinking tenderly about him . Though she knew that , in a sense , it was just a college romance , they enjoyed each other with such relish , joked , loved , and talked like long-lost friends . There was no telling where it would lead . Or need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as the other woman . After dinner one day , they returned to his apartment , and spent all evening making love until they were both too exhausted to do anything but sleep . Because there would be a call from his wife , he got up weakly from bed and began getting back into his crisp , tidy clothes , which included socks with garters , cufflinks , and a suit . The telephone rang , as it invariably did when they were together , and she suggested they might be in training for a prize-fighting match . You can answer that , she said , which is what she always said , because he looked terror-struck as a spotted deer when it rang , and then she would pretend not to be paying attention ; she would busy herself combing her hair or showering . But there was no way he could sound normal on the phone with his wife calling from Manhattan and his lover standing at the bathroom sink . He and his wife had a private language she would expect him to use , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover , something too cruel about making her eavesdrop on their tenderness . Not a chance , he said resolutely , and waited rigidly until the ringing stopped . Then he relaxed again , and she kissed him as he tried to button his shirt , kissed him as he pulled on his boxer shorts , which she found wildly sexy , kissed him as he sat on the bed trying to put on his socks and shoes , kissed him at the door . It was Friday . He was catching the night flight to New York . A long weekend like windswept tundra lay ahead of them . I 'll miss you , he said sleepily . It was the last she heard from him for weeks . <p> When he phoned at last , it was to make an excuse for not being in touch  --  he had a virus and had to stay home in bed  --  and then to explain that he would be out of town for a while , he had interviews in New York , and his wife was adamant about going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-of-fact , instead of playful , and there was none of the intimacy that had been such a sweet glue between them . He talked to her about neutral subjects , as if she were an acquaintance , and when she hung up the phone , she flit like a live list was turning in her chest . After that , they occasionally bumped into each other , buying a morning paper or once at a reception , and each time he would be sweet and festive , as if nothing at all was wrong , but also distant and distracted and unwilling to touch her too much , where before their hands were drawn to each other as if by magnets . Occasionally , when she invited him , they would meet out for lunch , and they would exchange news or talk about the world 's mishaps , but whenever she brought up his sudden chilliness he would deny it or change the subject . I was beginning to think your heart was a weathervane blowing in another direction , she said , which he flatly denied . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Should I invite you to meet me there ? she asked in a voice small and fragile as porcelain . It filled him with tenderness , it broke his heart . Yes ! I 'll call you next Monday to make the arrangements . But , as the time drew nearer , he changed his mind at tile last minute , and that told her everything , everything but the details . The small , heartfelt , spine-wrenching details of a lover 's disengagement . Silence . Over the next few months the silence was like an invisible bell clanging in every room of her house in every hour of the day until her bones ached . It made her crazy to think of the wonderful little habit he had of idly flicking his fingernails against each other . Though he was suave and urbane , he had a prankish sense of humor , a rolling laugh , and a zealous fondness for jokes , regular jokes with all elaborate build up and a punch line . He particularly liked sick or cynical jokes . She could n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him , probably she would n't be held at gunpoint and asked to produce one . Often he retold the same stories , and she encouraged him , and she frequently asked him to repent her favorite jokes , some of which she 'd heard him tell twelve or thirteen times , because they never failed to make her laugh  --  cynical humor is a vintage that never sours  --  and because she loved the way he became animated when he told them , swinging his hands and gesturing with such enthusiasm . She once noticed that his hands were large enough to hold a live , beating heart . It made her crazy to think of what she became when she was with him  --  his tenderness towards her was like fossil fuel and made her radiant and perfectly lovable and safe . <p> Although he had made her feel that way , she was not perfectly lovable . Slightly pear-shaped , she was too asymmetrical to be conventionally pretty . Her need to give and receive affection was bottomless . She tended to speak in a whispery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone , and wear her long brown hair falling all over her shoulders and face . Sometimes the hair fell into her food when she was eating , which he found off-putting ( why did n't she just tie it back ? ) , it always whipped him across the face at some point when they were making love , and on sultry days in the summer , she looked sweaty and hot as an unshorn sheep in a sauna . The unruly weather system of hair protected her from her fears , and it gave her cascades for the little girl to hide behind if need be , or the enthusiastically sensuous woman to smolder through . It was the cataract on the Nile of her insecurity . Cutting it or taming it was out of the question . Furthermore , she was always at half-rev , even when sitting still . She had a mind that tended to bustle and taste , and she had the terrible habit of fidgeting . Her idea of hell was a double feature . This , she knew , was in part why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than discovering that all that joie de vivre and friskiness did n't quit , was n't containable by a man , even if he could , if she trusted him , focus it for a little while . Not only was she an incorrigible punster , there was a level of verbal vandalism she just could n't resist . To be able to think something savagely witty was to have to say it , even if it was in bad taste or poorly timed . She could n't cook to save her or anyone else 's life . If at gunpoint she had to both tell a joke and cook , she would be dead twice over . Although she had plenty of what her mother used to call " inner resources , " she put her self-esteem in other people 's hands , took rejection badly , and got nervous in disarming but unattractive ways . One : she got witty the way other people got uneasy . Two : she went into adrenal overdrive and appeared to be a spinning Catherine wheel of energy , confidence , and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty minutes , revealing the small , vulnerable flame inside her , and want just to nap and let life 's well fill up . She drank Pepsi for breakfast , a particularly nasty habit that made her lover sick . She was so addicted to chocolate , with its cauldron of nicotine , beta-blockers , and enzymes , that she suggested he buy her a chocolate alert medal : In case of emergency , first administer chocolate , it would say . Worst of all , she was enormously passionate about life , passionate in her pleasure and , unfortunately , passionate in her pain . <p> So her lover 's sudden emotional retreat , with no explanation , swelled up inside of her like a balloon trapped in her ribs . At first , she tried to distract herself with other men . In Boston , she went out on a date with an unusual man she met and , under other circumstances , would have been wildly attracted to . But the missing ingredient was the man with tissue paper in his shirts who could at one moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antlers with his fingers held up to his ears . <p> He left for good , without saying goodbye , when the semester ended , and she did n't hear from him again . Arriving in New York a year later , she had no wish to phone him . So much time had passed , and to her surprise she still hurt so much . If it had only been the rejection that would be manageable . But she still missed him . That was the problem . Still missed the casual finesse of being together , and even passing his floor on an elevator made her sad . Should she stop by , say she was in the building and just thought she 'd look in on him ? A glance at her watch . 12:30 . He would be at lunch . At a favorite Northern Italian reaturant , unless he had changed his eating habits , too . On a whim , she walked two blocks west and went into it . If he was n't there , she would go over her briefing sheets and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " One for lunch ? " the maitre d ' asked . <p> " Yes , one . Wait a moment . I see a friend . " <p> How could she mistake his tall , neatly suited form at a corner table with two other , slightly younger and more casually dressed men ? He had let his hair grow a little longer at the sides , and he looked tanned from some recent assignment to Uganda to write about hunger or to the Madre de Dios to write about the disappearance of the rainforest . For him , a tan was like travel stickers on a suitcase . The tan said he had been somewhere to listen to the heartbeat of the planet ; his weekly Times articles said where . On the plate in front of him Jay a piece of extremely rare steak . <p> Standing right behind him , she said by way of greeting : " I 've seen animals die from worse wounds . " <p> When he laughed it was the laugh she knew and felt warm from all down her spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look who it is . " He introduced her to his colleagues and insisted that she join them . " We 're just talking about the African green monkey . " <p> " I read your article on its links to AIDS in last week 's Science Times . Is there more news ? " <p> " Well , apparently so . Anyway , the World Health Organization thinks so . " <p> She listened intently as he summarized the latest lowdown on what had become a modern-day plague , the source of so much fear and misery , so many witch-hunts . But in truth she was just enjoying the sheer spectacle of him , the sensory pleasure of seeing his face again and taking part in that verbal dance one dances with a friend whose facial expressions one knows line by line . Still , they were so public there could n't be any real conversation . She wanted to say : " But how are you really ? " Only she knew he would n't give her a straight answer . She could tell that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected appearance . There were lulls in the conversation , when they could speak quietly together , but he did n't fill them with any real interest in her doings beyond what etiquette decreed . He was appropriate . They talked about books to take along for vacation reading over Christmas , and he mentioned one  --  about a young woman having an affair with an older man  --  that she made a mental note to pick up after lunch at the bookstore just around the corner . She could n't have said what it was about his voice or his look , but something about the book nagged at hen and when she bought it and took it back to her apartment and sat down to read it , she understood why . <p> Reading the first pages felt like rasping cells off her arms and legs one by one . There in a charming , tender novel were all the daily passions and turmoils of his love affair with an old flame , an affair that had history , that had begun years before when he met the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the habits of his attention , the daily phone calls , the desperate brief meetings just for stolen kisses , the cheerful nature and urbanity and home life that were transparently his . It was a book drenched with his quirkiness , his ex-lover 's quirkiness , and their undeniable love for each other . It was agony to read . Now she understood what he had n't been able to tell her , that he had met his old flame again , and it was a fire that was consuming his vacant moments and the empty pockets in his life as it had before . There was nothing left over . Worst of all , she could n't help liking the woman , who was sensitive and funny , even if by her own admission she was usually cranky and a bit of a slob . She could see how their relationship had evolved , meshed beautifully , since both were happily married and both drawn preternaturally to each other . She read about their romantic getaways to New England when their spouses were out of town at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resolved , and then developed again when her husband found out and divorced her , leaving her suddenly single and available but in love with a strictly unavailable man . She looked at the dust jacket where a cheeky blonde stared back winningly . They were about the same age . Now , the biographical note explained , she lived with her husband and a child . She had remarried . The odds were even again . The scales of their affair that had been out of balance for a while were in business . Looking back , she knew it could n't have been easy for him , meeting her when he was still carrying a torch for his old girlfriend , only to bump into that girlfriend after years , take up with her again , and then have to find a way to withdraw from his more recent romance . <p> Sitting on her black couch , wearing an old lavender sweatsuit and no makeup , as he had never seen her , with her hair tied back in a ponytail and held by two clips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past year , and she was torn . When it came to love , her ethics were those of a time traveler . If he had managed to find an ecological niche that did n't include her , it was n't for her to tamper with the flora and fauna , it was n't for her to disturb that equilibrium . She wanted him to be happy . But she also ached to be with him . She wanted at the very least to fit tenderly into his life and he into hers , to be intimate , affectionate friends . She thought : love is such torture it should be turned loose on the enemy . <p> When she stood up , slowly , as if she were unraveling in reverse , she looked for a place to put the novel among the mosaic of books lining the walls , but there was nowhere she could think of that would n't sadden her . Life would be acceptable if it were n't for thinking , she observed . And , because she had n't cooked , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner , where she went most nights , and to write her landlord about the possibility of planting a theme garden on his fire escape . Nothing large . Maybe a garden of flowers all chosen for their smells  --  geraniums , rosemary , lilac , sweet peas , roses  --  or perhaps a garden that bloomed only at night , or even a Shakespearean garden . <p> She knew in time the ingot in her chest would lighten up . What she really wanted was to plant a garden that attracted only hummingbirds  --  a garden full of delphiniums and Canterbury bells and foxgloves and columbine  --  and she knew that was possible somewhere , but she realized with a sigh that there were no hummingbirds left in Manhattan , to search lifelong for sweetness , with their small urgent hearts and their strong ever-beating wings . <p> <p> By Diane Ackerman <p>
