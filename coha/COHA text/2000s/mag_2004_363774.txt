Every 45 seconds , someone in America has a stroke ; every three minutes , someone dies of one . That translates into 700,000 strokes and 165,000 deaths each year , making ischemia ( the technical term for the most common type of stroke ) the nation 's No. 3 killer . Even among survivors , strokes can exact a terrible toll : aftereffects range from difficulty walking , speaking and carrying out the everyday activities of life to depression and paralysis . <P> The key to treatment is speed . As the American Stroke Association 's slogan puts it : " Time lost is brain lost . " The clot-busting drug TPA , for example , has to be delivered within a critical treatment window that closes about three hours after symptoms first appear . The most exciting research presented at the 29th International Stroke Conference in San Diego last week was advances aimed at opening that window a little wider . Among them : <P> COOLER HEADS Researchers know lower temperatures protect the brain from injury , but cooling the brain usually cools the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . A Japanese study presented last week reported that a helmet using a liquid-cooling technology developed by NASA and designed to cool only the head shows great promise as a way to reduce the severity of neural damage . The researchers hope such a helmet may someday be used by emergency personnel to slow the progression of a stroke and lengthen the time a patient is eligible for clot-busting therapy . <P> VAMPIRE BATS There 's a chemical in the saliva of blood-sucking bats that resists clotting and helps keep a victim 's blood flowing . The same chemical can be used to dissolve clots , and researchers have developed a synthetic version of the compound that 's so effective it can extend the time window for treatment in some patients from three hours to as many as nine . <P> The corkscrew The most direct approach to fighting stroke is to break up the blood clot that is causing it ; the risk is that the clot will break into smaller particles that then lodge deeper in the brain . At the meeting last week , researchers reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can snag clots and pull them out without disrupting them  --  stopping the stroke damage almost instantly . The mechanical embolus removal in cerebral ischemia ( MERCI ) system restored blood flow in 54% of patients as long as eight hours after initial stroke symptoms appeared . <P> The best treatment of all , of course , is to prevent strokes from happening in the first place . The steps doctors recommend are pretty straightforward . If you have high blood pressure , reduce it . If your cholesterol level is high , lower it . If you smoke , stop . If you drink , do it moderately . If you 're overweight , reduce . And if you are sedentary , exercise . <P> Sound hard ? Look at it this way : if you do these things to reduce your risk of stroke , you 'll also reduce your risk of a heart attack .
