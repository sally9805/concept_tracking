SCOUTS-VIEWS COLTS Everyone knows Peyton Manning has a great arm and great command of the offense , but the work he puts in between Monday and Saturday is the key to his success . ... Reggie Wayne has kind of been their unsung hero the last few years . He has n't been the game breaker everyone sees in Marvin Harrison , but he makes big plays and he 's a guy you need to account for . ... Having a guy like Adam Vinatieri , who has kicked under pressure and won under pressure , is a big plus . That one element could be the difference in them going to the Super Bowl . JAGUARS Marcus Stroud and John Henderson are disruptive in the middle of their defensive line . They push the pocket and make runners go east and west instead of north and south . ... They could start their own basketball team with their wide receivers . Obviously , losing Jimmy Smith was a blow , but they have big targets , guys who are bigger than most defensive backs . ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical year , but they 're at the point where they feel they need to step up to that next level to be the type of playoff team they hope to be . TITANS I really like Kyle Vanden Bosch . A lot of guys can harass the passer and force other guys to make sacks . I want the guy who 's a sacker-and that 's what he does . ... The stage is set for Vince Young to step in at some point . I think they 're in a rebuilding stage , and they might as well start rebuilding with the guy they drafted . ... Their corners are just adequate , including Pacman Jones . TEXANS They wanted to make sure they got a potential Pro Bowl-type player for the defense , and Mario Williams fits the bill . Was he a popular choice over Reggie Bush ? No , but he was probably the right choice . ... In Dunta Robinson , they have a corner they can put on the other team 's best receiver . If you do n't have that type of guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big name some of his teammates do , but he makes big plays . Predicted finish : 1 Colts 13-3* 2 Jaguars 9-7 3 Titans 5-11 4 Texans 4-12 1 Indianapolis COLTS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : As long as QB Peyton Manning is under center , the Colts will be legitimate Super Bowl contenders . Management wo n't allow the offensive talent around him to drop off . The team did n't re-sign RB Edgerrin James because it believed James will be an elite player for only another year or two and was unwilling to give him the four-year deal he was seeking . The running game will at least be respectable with Dominic Rhodes and/or first-round pick Joseph Addai carrying the load . The passing game will be as productive as ever . WR Marvin Harrison shows no signs of slowing down , and WR Reggie Wayne continues to get better . If it is relatively healthy , a young defense led by Es Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis will only improve . Those two spearhead one of the league 's most aggressive and disruptive lines . Management replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Patriots star Adam Vinatieri . Vanderjagt had two critical misses in the postseason , including his errant attempt against the Steelers . Vinatieri simply does n't miss money kicks . REASONS FOR CONCERN : Injuries to SS Bob Sanders ( shoulder ) , FS Mike Doss ( calf ) , CB Jason David ( groin ) and Ts Corey Simon ( knee ) and Montae Reagor ( knee ) have prevented the defense from becoming cohesive this summer . Most of those five are expected to be ready for the opener . Simon is coming off arthroscopic surgery ; if he 's limited early , second-year players Darrell Reid and Sweet Pea Burns will need to contribute . Doss is solid in run support but can be a liability in coverage . If he falters , rookie Antoine Bethea could challenge him for a starting spot . Bethea is raw but has good ability and instincts . Until Rhodes and Addai prove themselves , defenses will focus on stopping the pass . Manning will need to be as patient and disciplined as he was during the team 's 13-0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Colts to win their fourth straight division championship and join the 1992-95 Cowboys as the only teams to win at least 12 games in four consecutive seasons . But the season ultimately will be measured by postseason success , and anything short of a trip to the AFC title game would be a disappointment . The window of opportunity is n't necessarily closing on the Colts , but it wo n't stay open forever . - Mike Chappell STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Reggie Wayne 4 LT Tarik Glenn 5 LG Ryan Lilja 3 C Jeff Saturday 4 RG Jake Scott 3 RT Ryan Diem 3 TE Dallas Clark 3 WR Marvin Harrison 5 WR Brandon Stokley 2 QB Peyton Manning 5 RB Dominic Rhodes 3 DEFENSE LE Robert Mathis 4 DT Montae Reagor 3 DT Raheem Brock 3 RE Dwight Freeney 5 OLB Gilber Gardner 2 MLB Gary Brackett 3 OLB Cato June 4 CB Nick Harper 3 CB Jason David 3 SS Bob Sanders 4 FS Mike Doss 3 SPECIALISTS K Adam Vinatieri 5 P Hunter Smith 4 KR T.J.

For some reason , he gets under everybody 's skin and everybody wants to fight him come the second quarter . Worst ride : Mike Doss has got an " old school , " one of those things you try to fix up . He 's got a laptop computer in the front . It just looks terrible . It 's right there-steering wheel , laptop , glove compartment . It 's like a Monte Carlo or something . Best thing about our training room : The training staff . They keep it light in there . Anything goes . We call it the barbershop . Rookie dues : They take us out to a big dinner . DBs , they really do them dirty . Big , expensive dinners . Same with the linemen . They make them get limos , things like that . Beware of this guy in the locker room : We do n't have a big prankster in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corey ( Simon ) is a big kid .

Man , you talk about walking out on tabs and all that . That 's a Freeney move . 2 Jacksonville JAGUARS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : The defense is a tough , disciplined unit built around DTs Marcus Stroud and John Henderson and MLB Mike Peterson , though the unit would be dealt a blow if the knee injury Peterson suffered last week becomes a lingering problem . Assuming hard-hitting SS Donovln Darius makes a strong comeback from knee surgery , the secondary also will be an asset . CBs Rashean Mathis and Brian Williams have good size and playmaking skills . The special teams will be solid if K Josh Scobee overcomes a preseason leg injury .

The team also has shown that it can win on the road . REASONS FOR CONCERN : WR Jimmy Smith 's retirement in May left a void in the offense . Second-year pro Matt Jones was hurt much of the preseason and does n't look ready for the No. 1 role ; Ernest Wilford and Reggie Williams were inconsistent and inspired little confidence that they can be the game-breaking receivers the team needs , " me offensive line also has sputtered , opening few holes for the running game and allowing defenses to pressure the quarterbacks . The sluggish running game has left some to wonder whether the club will jettison the frequently injured Fred Taylor in favor of the bruising Greg Jones and the explosive Jones-Drew , though that plan could be affected by Jones ' recent knee injury , which bears watching .

Not too many people are going to ride around with that . People might think you 're talking about a real hen or something . Cheapest teammate : Rob Meier , hands down . He wo n't spend a dime . He 's very conservative-let 's put it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road trip I like most : Phoenix . Great scenery , good restaurants and a lot to do . I 'm from Florida , so it was neat to see the mountains they have out there . Huddle moment : When we 're at home , the defense is on the field and the songs start playing . The guys start dancing , and it gets everybody into it . Weirdest pregame ritual : Donovin Darius always makes me laugh with the way he lines his helmet , jersey and pants up in front of his locker before he puts it on . As if that 's going to make a difference . Worst ride : Ernest Wilford still has his old Camry , and the guys get on him about that . There 's nothing wrong with it , but it 's a Camry . That 's all you have to say . Player I most hate to play against : Marvin Harrison . He 's a great athlete , and you have to respect his abilities . Plus , he does n't talk . He just does his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TITANS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : The Titans signed four veterans to provide leadership for a team that was the NFL 's youngest in 2005 . C Kevin Mawae , WR David Givens , FS Chris Hope and OLB David Thornton will make a difference on the field and in the locker room . If the team struggles early , it wo n't crumble as it did last season . RBs Chris Brown , Travis Henry and rookie LenDale White all are solid options as the team attempts to establish the running game . Brown is injury-prone , but he hopes 10 extra pounds will help him hold up better . Henry is 10 pounds lighter and clearly faster because of it . White brings quick feet and toughness to the mix . Second-year CB Pacman Jones has improved his technique considerably . He 's a big threat in the return game , where he 'll handle punts and perhaps kickoffs . REASONS FOR CONCERN : Career backup Billy Volek has plenty to prove as he takes over for QB Steve McNair . Volek has a strong arm but tends to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's raw and not ready to contribute . The addition of Mawae helps , but the offensive line is dealing with plenty of change-including the loss of free-agent C Justin Hartwig to the Panthers . T Michael Roos has moved to the left side , with T Jacob Bell taking over on the right side . Gs Zach Piller and Benji Olson do n't move as well as they once did . There is little depth in the secondary , and S Vincent Fuller is an unproven nickel back . Some of these backups are going to have to play . WYATT 'S BOTTOM LINE : The Titans made upgrades , but they are not ready for a postseason run . The offense lacks playmakers , the defense has little depth , and injuries in the preseason have left the team even thinner . Young and White are important building blocks , and salary cap problems now are a thing of the past . Look for the team to be more competitive , but with a tough schedule the record might not improve . - Jim Wyatt STARTING LINEUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zach Piller 2 C Kevin Mawae 3 RG Benji Olson 3 RT Jacob Bell 3 TE Erron Kinney 3 WR Drew Bennett 3 QB Billy Volek 2 FB Troy Fleming 2 RB Chris Brown 3 DEFENSE LE Kyle Vanden Bosch 5 DT Albert Haynesworth 4 DT Randy Starks 2 RE Travis LaBoy 2 OLB David Thornton 4 MLB Peter Sirmon 3 OLB Keith Bulluck 5 CB Reynaldo Hill 3 CB Pacman Jones 3 SS Lamont Thompson 3 FS Chris Hope 4 SPECIALISTS K Rob Bironas 3 P Craig Hentrich 4 KR Bobby Wade 3 PR Pacman Jones 4 LS Ken Amato 3 Players rated 1-5 , with 5 highest SNAPSHOT with MLB Peter Sirmon Funniest trash-talker : Pacman Jones . I 'm not sure there is a filter from the brain to the mouth , so that 's what makes his trash-talking so entertaining . He lets everything fly . Bet you did n't know this about Jeff Fisher : He loves to go fly-fishing in Montana . Most wired : Kyle Vanden Bosch does n't give high-fives ; he gives head slaps . I have to put the mouthpiece in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to slap my head . I have n't told him to stop it , though . Most memorable slobberknocker : Against the Eagles in my third year , Donovan McNabb pump-faked , I jumped up and Duce Staley caught me in the air and slammed me into the ground . I thought my chest was going through my spine . Player I most hate to play against : Edgerrin James . He is just so strong . Sometimes you try and tackle him and you feel like you are a calf wrestler in the rodeo . Road trip I like most : Houston . We usually have pretty good steaks , and the stadium is nice , too . You do n't have to dress in high school locker rooms . Rookie dues : A $13,000 dinner tab . That 's what Pacman 's was , and it 's going to be better this year with Vince ( Young ) . It could be in the 20s . We all saw what he got for guaranteed money . 4 Houston TEXANS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : The players quickly bought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a track record of success as offensive coordinator in Denver for 10 years and injected a much-needed fresh attitude into a locker room that had been drained of confidence.The offensive line has been overhauled , and QB David Carr has newfound trust in the players protecting him . With former Packers coach Mike Sherman supervising the line and the Broncos ' successful zone-blocking scheme as the base , the Texans no longer will have the worst pass protection in the league . The defensive players have embraced the switch from a 3-4 to a 4-3 . The line is by far the Texans ' strongest and deepest unit , and Es Maria Williams and Anthony Weaver will give the team an aggressive outside pass rush . REASONS FOR CONCERN : There will be a transition period-and some bumps along the way-as the players adjust to a new coaching staff and new offensive and defensive schemes . There are no guarantees when it comes to RB Domanick Davis ' health , so the team will count on one of its youngsters-likely rookie Wali Lundy or Vernand Morency-to step up at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a concern at most positions , and injuries already have hit the secondary , linebackers and running backs . The Texans could start as many as seven first- or second-year players , so much will depend on how fast they emerge . That includes Williams , who will have to attract double-teams to free up other defenders . Seth Wand , 27 , beat promising rookie Charles Spencer for the starting left tackle job because Wand is more reliable , but blind-side protection still could be an issue . MANFULL 'S BOTTOM LINE : Expect the Texans to show significant progress and improve upon last season 's 2-14 record . But given all the changes , a turnaround wo n't happen overnight . - Megan Manfull STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Andre Jonhson 4 LT Seth Wand 2 LG Chester Pitts 3 C Mike Flanagan 4 RG Steve McKinney 3 RT Zach Wiegert 3 TE Mark Bruener 3 WR Eric Moulds 3 QB David Carr 3 FB Jameel Cook 2 RB Domanic Davis 3 DEFENSE LE Anthony Weaver 3 DT Travis Johnson 2 DT Robaire Smith 3 RE Mario Williams 3 OLB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 CB Dunta Robinson 4 CB Lewis Sanders 2 SS Glenn Earl 3 FS C.C.

He likes to eat his pregame meal in the bathroom . Huddle moment : We were in a " 4-minute offense " a couple years ago , and we were trying to run time off the clock to win the game . David ( Carr ) called a play that I had never heard before . He was just joking . I said , " Wait a minute , we do n't have that play ! " Everyone laughed . Basically , it was just a prank on me . Rookie dues : Coach Kubiak is real good at providing entertainment for us . He has rookies get up and sing before big team meetings . My body on Monday morning : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of miles and then the car backed up and ran over you . Getting out of bed can take a very long time . Bet you did n't know this about Gary Kubiak : One of the unique things about coach Kubiak is he knows where everybody went to school and their stats . He 'll be in the middle of practice , and you 'll do something . He 'll say , " You rushed for 1,100 yards your senior year in high school-why ca n't you perform better now ? " He 'll actually name the high school . It 's crazy . <p>
