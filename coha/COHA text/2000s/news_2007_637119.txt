<p> Despite a magnificent view from her office , Rita Sheffey seems awfully concerned about how things look on the street . <p> Sheffey , a partner with Hunton &; Williams , has clients who need help with environmental , patent and trademark law who pay the firm 's corporate-level fees . But she spends well over a thousand hours a year on pro bono projects  --  work for which she does not charge . <p> She and the lawyers she supervises have helped couples get divorced , handled the legal side of adoption and negotiated the labyrinths of FEMA so that New Orleans evacuees could get the benefits they deserved . <p> The clients , generally , are just poor enough so they ca n't afford an attorney but not quite impoverished enough to qualify for Legal Aid . <p> Those projects do n't pay the bills , but they are a crucial part of the firm 's self-image  --  and one of the benchmarks for measuring performance , she said . <p> " Yes , of course , it 's about economics . But the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Commitment to service is one of the core values in the firm . <p> " We have billable goals that we are all expected to meet . We are evaluated . What you do to contribute to business development  --  we think about that with young lawyers from the beginning , but also there 's a pro bono expectation of every lawyer in the firm . " <p> Most members of the firm do some pro bono work , she said . " I 've done more than most . " <p> A less-than-complete list of her involvement : She coordinates the firm 's pro bono work in Atlanta , which includes the Southside Legal Center and the firm 's guardian ad litem project in Fulton County . She is also vice chair of Atlanta Victim Assistance Inc. , a member of the executive committee of the Atlanta Legal Aid Society Inc. and of the Supreme Court of Georgia Committee on Civil Justice . <p> The route to pro bono legal work was somewhat unusual : Leaving her Virginia high school , she meant to be a doctor . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chemistry degree from the University of Virginia and headed to Duke University and studied for a doctorate . <p> She was a researcher for a professor attached to Harvard Medical School when the wind shifted . She enrolled at Boston College Law School . <p> " I have three ACC schools , " she said , and chuckled . " Although that may not always be such a good thing in Georgia . " <p> The newly minted attorney went back to Virginia , working in the Richmond office of Hunton &; Williams . A few years later , she moved into an opening the firm had in Atlanta . <p> Sheffey had done pro bono work in Richmond and kept it up in Atlanta . Now , roughly half her work is pro bono . <p> " I did pro bono maybe 100 hours a year ... but you are going back 20 years now . Last year , I probably did about 270 hours on pro bono and maybe 1,200 or 1,300 hours on other unpaid things . I am on nonprofit boards and the bar association board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's about half my practice now . <p> " I did n't set out to do this , " she said . " I just turned around one day and it was there . " <p> Q : How did you become so committed to pro bono work ? <p> A : I 've always been involved in lots of activities  --  in high school , in college . I think it 's one of those natural things . When I started with Hunton &; Williams in Richmond , it was clear the firm had a history of involvement and offered support for being involved . I did mostly divorces for a couple years . <p> I did it A , because it was something I was interested in ; and B , because it was something the firm encouraged . What you got from it was the satisfaction of helping people untangle a marriage , which they could n't have done without a lawyer . And it was a good experience . <p> Q : Do you really think there 's a value in the work  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned how to interview a client , how to relate to a client . Some of the things were pretty simple , but it 's so important to have that direct client interaction , the basic lawyering skills  --  like listening . I think listening is important . <p> Q : But what about the firm  --  obviously , every hour you are working pro bono is an hour that you can not be billing clients . ... How can the firm be so comfortable about pro bono ? <p> A : Obviously profits are important . But there is also an emphasis on people being well-rounded . I ca n't say my being on a board or doing pro bono is worth ' X ' amount of dollars , but it obviously has multiple benefits . <p> I think it 's good for the law firm . And a lot of people can work up the business case for pro bono . I have to say that I have n't added up that business case . But I think it 's good in several ways . <p> It 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill development , for the firm 's visibility . <p> Q : No conflict with the other work you do ? <p> A : Obviously we take it with the same professionalism as we do everything else . You could be doing a complicated motion for a Fortune 100 client , too  --  and one of those things has got to move . But the goal is to make sure every client is taken care of . <p> Q : And your clients  --  your paying clients  --  are all right with it , too ? Is that ever a problem ? <p> A : My billable clients know that I do work for them , too . Most of them have a culture that supports pro bono work , too . But you occasionally do have one of them say , ' Can you do something for me pro bono ? ' <p> Q : I still need to ask the obvious question . Why would someone who had a perfectly good career in chemistry decide to become a lawyer ? <p> A : Everybody always wants to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not a typical researcher . I felt too isolated . I need something more people-oriented . And I always had a latent interest in government and politics . And I thought if I was going to do this , now is the time . Was it what I expected ? From a people perspective , absolutely . This is a very service-oriented people business . That is what I like about it . " <p> Q : Are any of these cases enjoyable ? And what is the flip side ? <p> A : Adoption cases are fun . They are not generally acrimonious and confrontational . <p> But sometimes I just ca n't do something , and I just do n't know who to send someone to . I had one this morning . He is divorced . ... The father is paying child support and has a visitation order . He wants to enforce the order . His wife left the state . But he makes too much money for our pro bono services . I do n't like to say no , but you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> I am interested in a lot of different things from a lot of different aspects and I have a hard time saying no . I want to do everything , and you ca n't do everything . <p> THE RITA A.
