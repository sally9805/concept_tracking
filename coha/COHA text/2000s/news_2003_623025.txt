<p> Against the backdrop of long-standing resistance from the San Francisco Police Department , the civilian agency charged with monitoring the department has begun its own investigation into whether top commanders blocked the probe of a street fight involving the assistant chief 's son . <p> The Office of Citizen Complaints , established by voters 20 years ago to look into outside accusations of police misconduct , will investigate allegations that three off-duty patrol officers assaulted two civilians and whether members of the department 's command staff conspired to cover up the incident . <p> But in what the OCC has called an " epidemic " of defiance , increasing numbers of rank and file police are simply ignoring the agency 's investigations . And in some cases , the department has sat on complaints forwarded for disciplinary action for so long that time limits have expired and the complaints ca n't be acted on . <p> Officers refused to cooperate with OCC investigations in 63 cases last year and 88 in 2001 , an increase from the 27 cases in 2000 . In 29 cases last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The public has spoken , yet 20 years later we still have a Police Department that fundamentally <p> <p> is not cooperating with the OCC , " said John Crew , the American Civil Liberties Union 's police practices expert here for 15 years until 2001 . <p> " You have officers who not only just do n't cooperate , they do n't respond and they do n't respect the basic authority of the OCC . It 's a huge scandal . " <p> To the panel 's critics , the scandal is the OCC itself . <p> " If San Francisco police officers treated people on the street like the OCC treats officers , the OCC would fire those officers , " said Jim Collins , a former cop and a defense attorney whose clients include Officer Alex Fagan Jr. , charged with assault in the Nov. 20 street fight . <p> " They 're rude , they have an agenda , especially if the case is at all political , " Collins said . " If it is a political-appearing case , they ignore all the exculpating facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of 100 or so agencies charged with civilian police oversight , San Francisco 's OCC has a reputation as one of the best staffed and most powerful . It has a staff of 30 and a strong mandate from the City Charter to investigate any complaint a citizen lodges against police . <p> In the five-year period ending in 2001 , the OCC found evidence of serious misconduct in 1,083 citizen allegations , nearly all of which involved excessive force , conduct unbecoming an officer , unauthorized actions or neglect of duty . <p> Most of those cases went to the Police Department , which can order counseling or suspensions of 10 days or less . A small fraction went before the Police Commission , which can impose more lengthy suspensions up to dismissal . <p> In the case of the Nov. 20 street fight , OCC officials said last week that they had launched the probe in response to a citizen 's complaint . The investigation comes as eight officers face criminal charges , and as the Police Commission turns to an outside investigator to look into how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the OCC has a lot of power , said Samuel Walker , a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha . " But if the department does n't enforce the rules , the whole thing collapses . " <p> LACK OF DIRECTION <p> The OCC is facing other problems . Even its supporters said the agency is ill-equipped to take on the department without its most effective leader , Mary Dunlap , who ran the office from 1996 until her death from cancer in January . <p> The OCC is now run by three co-directors , none of whom has jumped at the chance to fill Dunlap 's spot permanently . Mayor Willie Brown said the search is on for a new director , and hopes to have someone in place soon . <p> Two months after her death , Dunlap 's presence is still very much felt at the agency . Her office remains much as it was when she went on leave to battle pancreatic cancer , complete with her name plate on the door , her neatly arrayed desk and her bird-chirping clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agency is rudderless . <p> " I think they need another Mary , " said Susan Rutberg , a former public defender turned Golden Gate University law professor . <p> " This would have have been a moment where she would have had something to say , " Rutberg said . " She would have talked about how really wonderful it would be to have a police department that was above reproach , and when something like this happens , for it to behave like other police departments would behave . " <p> The OCC 's stature , however , started deteriorating even when Dunlap was still on the job , thanks to a series of legal rulings that forced police disciplinary cases to be dealt with quickly or not at all . <p> ONE YEAR RULE <p> The rulings blocked the OCC from acting on its own to notify officers they face charges  --  that job went to the police chief . In most cases , allegations of misconduct now have to be handled within a year or dropped . <p> In January , Jean Field , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department had gone more than three months without acting on two dozen cases of police misconduct forwarded by the OCC . <p> Field told Chief Earl Sanders that the department 's internal affairs arm " has failed in its duty to process OCC complaints in a timely and efficient manner . " <p> But Assistant Chief Alex Fagan Sr. wrote in a letter that the OCC 's numbers were " grossly misleading . " In 17 of the cases , he said , the department had meted out discipline or was in the process of doing so . <p> However , the assistant chief acknowledged that five of the cases had died because the statute of limitations had expired without the department acting . He said the department had never gotten two of the cases that Field cited . <p> Even when the department has taken action , the results have n't often been to the OCC 's liking . <p> In 2001 , the department lodged four misconduct charges against Officer Steven Hutzler after seven witnesses backed a claim that he had thrown bike messenger Nathaniel Stein to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcade for the king and queen of Jordan . <p> OFFICER CLEARED BY FAGAN <p> The disciplinary hearing was eventually sent to Fagan , and last year he cleared Hutzler of wrongdoing . <p> " For anyone to see this as anything other than a clear-cut case of excessive force really defies logic and the evidence , " said Jim Chanin , Stein 's attorney . " The issue is preventing this from happening in the first place  --  the only way is to make examples of the officers . . . . Otherwise , it is only going to serve as an incentive for it to happen again . " <p> Stein said , " I was n't naive enough to think that this guy would be disciplined and fired . But I did n't want to let it go . That guy needs to know he ca n't just do that . " <p> The city paid $6,000 to Stein in an out-of-court settlement . <p> Fagan Sr. declined to comment for this story . <p> Walker said the OCC has to assert itself to address the crisis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They need to figure out ways to ensure that misconduct is reported and acted upon , " he said , adding that officer compliance is also a major issue . <p> " It looks like a big breakdown when there is serious erosion in officers cooperating  --  someone allowed this to happen , somebody has failed , somebody is responsible for that . " <p> LACK OF DISCRETION <p> But Steve Johnson , a retired police lieutenant who now handles misconduct issues for the police union , said the OCC 's biggest problem is its " lack of quality control . " <p> He said most of the OCC complaints deal with minor accusations , such as making unnecessary traffic stops , and they should be dismissed from the get-go . Instead , he said , the agency conducts a full investigation , leaving a mark on the officer 's record , regardless of whether the complaint is upheld . <p> Far from encouraging noncompliance , he said , the union goes out of its way to make sure the officers show up for interviews . But , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get sick  --  their kid can get sick , . . . they can have a court date , work a midnight shift . " <p> Chris Cunnie , the Police Officers Association 's president , said the OCC tends to get bogged down " in the minutiae " of even minor cases . He prefers mediation to resolve differences . <p> " Sometimes all a citizen wants is an apology or an explanation from an officer , " Cunnie said.E-mail the writers at **28;10130;TOOLONG and rgordon@sfchronicle.com.
