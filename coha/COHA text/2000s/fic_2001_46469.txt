Far down the aisles of the forest the enchantment held its wonderful sway , and she felt in her own ignorant fashion how beautiful is the accustomed light . When the horse 's stumbling feet had ceased to sound among the stones , the wilderness without was as lonely and unsuggestive of human occupation or human existence as when the Great Smoky Mountains first rose from the sea . Charles Egbert Craddock , American novelist , 1885 <p> One , traveler . AN OLD WOMAN WALKED SLOWLY through the woods . She stopped and stared at a waterfall . She was dressed in her black , handmade clothes , with a goat-wool blanket over one shoulder , to lie down on . Straw-white old hair , unbound and unkempt , stuck up and out . She carried a thick wooden stick , had a leather bag tied around her waist , and that was her . She stopped and looked at the waterfall gushing . With her stick she pushed aside brush , hacked down some brier . No mistake . Carson 's Falls . She was upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped , poked around with her stick . The brush was thin , cut recently . Who did that ? She found the ruts of an abandoned trail . She shook her head , poked her way through thicker brush that had overgrown the hidden trail . Then she stopped , staring ahead at empty air . She had walked herself into a mountaintop meadow . It was a windswept bald . She was waist-high in timothy grass . Before her was a boulder and a bluff , a sudden , sheer end of the mountain and a drop-off that made her dizzy now as it had , she knew , made her dizzy before . The setting sun bathed her black dress in gold . She peered over the edge , then stamped around the boulder 's edge until she kicked up two rotted planks , and looked at what was under them . Then she dropped them , turned around , and went away from the bald . Was there surely a house , off behind that range of sycamores that was n't there ? More brush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large cornfield . She knew if the house was there , and if she could find ruts again , she could find the tree . It took her a while , but she did . It was a maple tree . It had many knobs and burls on it . Afternoon sunlight , leaf-dappled , poured down on her . The light hurt her eyes . She put her hands high on the tree . She found a burl , above her head . Something stuck out of it . She opened her leather bag , took out a barlow knife , reached up and cut into the burl . Something there . It was an old piece of glass . From a mirror . She rubbed it . She could see her face , old and lined , behind the scum . Two , family . A man and his son , tired and dirty , axes on their shoulders , were going home . A woman on a porch nursed her baby . She called out , Yoohoo ! The old woman heard that , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration . Maybe they are over there . She moved off through the brush , but away from the cabin . Supper , said the wife . Take a seat , said her husband . He flipped a crate on end for his son , shoved up a slat chair on rockers for his wife . He stood on his porch looking out over his land . Tell your mother what we did today . And his son said , Girdled trees . The old woman walked away from the maple tree . She stumbled , sank to one knee , bent over , one hand on the ground . An old cowbell . She picked it up . She jiggled it . She staggered to her feet and rang it . It clanked , peaceably . Ordinary thing . She clanged it louder and listened to it , shaking her head , astonished . This ca n't be . Daddy , we ai n't got no cows near the bluff . Some stray . Now sit down . They did . This here is our estate . The cowbell sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house . Yours one day , son , if you want it and can stand me . Your babies and then more babies plain after them . By God , I aim to build out this porch half again this wide . Cut that brush , we 'll be looking out over 159 acres ! All of it cleared ! All of it ours ! Son , when you can go , you can go . But if you stay , you stay . Understand that ? The old woman clanked her bell . She had moved in a circle and now stood again by the edge of the bald , one foot on one of the rotten planks . Above her was a drift of darkening clouds , bellies hairy with dark vapor , but through them the sun came down in one shot of straight light . Beyond her were steel-blue mountains , one behind another , vast in their own company . It was only a view . There were many such . She left it , as if suddenly hurt , holding out one hand behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Split me some wood , I got to heat ever'thing up again . The husband said he 'd get the damn wood , and he wanted his son to sit on that porch and think about what he wanted in this life . He went around back . The wife went inside . The boy sat there . How do you know what you want in this life ? Three , arrival . The boy shaded his face with his hand . He saw a shadow move just beyond the yard . It was the old woman . She held the piece of mirror in her hand . It caught the sun 's last light , which off a slant played on the boy 's face . He got up quickly . The dark figure walked out of the shadows of the brush . Hidy . Who 're you ? Where 's ever'body else ? What ? Let me figure this out . You 're some boy I never seen before . You live here ? Since one year ago when my Daddy he bought this place . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man living here , but he died . Name ? Larman , I think it was . I know that . I mean his first name . Abner , I think it was . Ask my Daddy . The boy jumped off the porch and ran around back . The old woman looked around the place . Ab ? The wife came out of the house . The boy and the husband came around the back . They all saw the old woman . Hidy . This your boy ? Yes . Said you bought this place from a man named Abner Larman . I bought this house and one hundred fifty-nine acre , but I bought it from the county . Mr. Larman died here , all alone . There was two hundred . And the old woman walked away . Hershel , it 's getting dark . She 'll fall down . The husband went off his steps , caught up with the old woman . It 's near dark . You live hereabouts ? About seven mile , over that west ridge . Seven mile ? Three-day walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? Nobody waiting for me nowhere . The husband led her back to the porch . The wife pushed the slat chair forward . They helped her sit . The wife tried to take her cowbell , but the old woman held on to it . Then with a sigh she closed her eyes , sat very still . The husband hunkered down next to her . You say you live seven mile from here ? In Tennessee . Tennessee border 's a good forty mile over the mountain . Thought so . Walked forty mile , from Tennessee ? " Bout seven . Three days " bout seven mile . A bird squawked . Her eyes came open , then closed again . Ravens still pester a man plowing ? Do . Where 'd you stay last night ? There was a creek I knowed from somewhere . It comes down the mountain , undercuts the rock . Sandy and dry there a ways underneath the ledge . Made me a gig out of my barlow knife and a stick . Gigged two frogs . Keep my matches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was last night . Where you heading ? Here . She opened her eyes . New post beams . Some of this floor is all different . Not much of a job ; you do it ? Beams , not the flooring . Ab would n't . Billy maybe . All gone now . The old woman laughed , sudden and harsh . She got up , with energy . Place ai n't rightfully yours at all . It 's mine . A raven , on the updrafts above those people , could see a split-log house and four people on its porch . It could see a white-haired old woman , dressed in black , begin to walk up and down while a family watched her . And another raven on those same drafts , sixty years before , could have seen that same woman . Four , courtship . When she was nineteen , she walked right there , on that porch . Her name was Samantha Larman , called Sassy . And to her came a man named Yawls Ridley . Rooster Ridley , men called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of satisfaction . Will you marry me ? If you will take me to Tennessee . I wo n't . We will live here in Carolina . Then you are a damn shit hog . And you are a woman powerful bitchy . Yawls Ridley went . Hensley Edwards came . Tennessee . He went , cursing her powerful bitchy . More the same . Alone with her refusals she was then , having to listen to other voices on that porch . Wild , said her mother . No way to talk to no man , said her father . Got to settle down , said one brother . Nineteen years old , said her sister . Who 's gon na want you after you hit twenty ? said another brother . Nobody , said a third . Be reasonable , said her mother . Her father saw someone coming . Griswold Plankman , said the sister . See , Sassy , what you 'll get ? said a brother . Griswold Barrel  --  Bottom Plankman , said another brother . That 's who , said the third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sister . All them Plankmans are crazy , said the father . Hello there , Griswold . Griswold Plankman came into the yard . He stepped carefully , a dirt farmer toward a clean house . He took off his hat . He gravely addressed them all . He had his hesitating courtliness , but a pockmarked face lopsided from bad teeth and a body twisted by farming . He coupled each name with a bow . Mr. Larman . Mizzes Larman . Billy . Morgan . Ab . Rachael . Sassy . Hello , Griswold . This here is a pleasant day . Dead-dog silence . It is , said the mother . Dead-dog silence . Dogwoods out , said Griswold . Gums , too , said the mother . Cherries bright red and dogwood too . Fire-red in the gum trees , said Griswold . Das n't forget that , said the mother , and Griswold said , With your sourwoods at color , no , indeed . What would we do if we could n't have a birch maple ? Get this tree-talking fool out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will talk squirrel , Griswold said . She 'll be pleased to , said her mother . Just do n't do it here , said her father . Five , Proposal . They walked down a road . Two ruts , dug by wagons . You are as welcome here as the bastard at the family reunion . They walked up from the road onto the bald . Moved near waisthigh in timothy grass . You know what made the river angry ? It got crossed so many times . When is a door not a door ? Jesus Christ , Griswold . When it 's ajar . Why is a pig the strangest thing ? I do n't know ! I do n't care ! A pig gets killed before he gets cured . Why is life the hardest riddle ? Ever'body has to give it up . They reached the bluff , timothy grass around a big outcropping of rock on the mountain 's edge . The sharp ridge dropped away , became miles and miles of air and blue distance . You wanting to be took to Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Tennessee . Forty mile over hard mountain , and nobody much in them . But I am taking you at your word . If that is what you want , I will give it to you . What could she say ? Her word . He took her back to her family on the porch of the cabin , and as formally as he came , he left . Wo n't happen , Sassy said . No man 'll sell Carolina bottomland for Tennessee slopes . He was talking to hear hisself think . Wo n't be back . Six , wedding . Griswold wore a threadbare black wool coat and a string tie off a collar sticking north and south . He held a little bunch of trailside wildflowers in one hand . He handed them to Sassy . She stared at him and took them in disgust . Then they turned to the preacher . Well ? said Sassy . Do you take this man for your lawful wedded husband ? said the preacher . God damn it , said Sassy . Man and wife , said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chalk line for bass fiddles , four sticks for rhythm . Planks on sawhorses ; eating the goat barbecue , the slaw , swiss chard , and the rhubarb pie . Men with pipes passing raw do-for-your-body corn , women sipping dainty plum brandy , do it for yours , too . Sassy sat stiffly in the family 's best mohair chair , Griswold standing deadpan beside her . Sassy for the first time fearful . Never left to go more than five miles away , not in all that young and scornful life . Then it all stopped . Like some signal , a sign given . Sassy shuddered . Her brothers brought up a wagon with a high-handed roan in front and a slouchy mule in back . Wedding presents . Griswold picked Sassy up and carried her to the wagon and set her in its seat . Then he climbed up next to his wife . Momma ? Poppa ? Billy ? Morgan ? Ab ? Rachael ? Bye , Sassy . Eight , wedding night . They got a little ways off from the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed off the back of the wagon . She went to a painted wooden box lying in the trail , broke open . Kneeling in the dirt , she picked over the spilled contents . My box of dressing things . Look ! My mirror 's busted ! You ai n't going to need mirrors in Tennessee . Sassy looked in the piece of glass . She saw her face , for the last time thinking , I am beautiful . My hair 's messed up . Wo n't be noticed from a galloping horse . Stick it in that burl yonder . Griswold got down . He took the broke-off glass from Sassy , went to a maple tree , and stuck the mirror into the burl so she could use it . Sassy fixed her hair . Then they got back in the wagon . There was a little sunlight still coming through the leaves . It caught the glass , and the mirror reflected it . They had n't gone five minutes more when Griswold stopped the , wagon again . He got off , said Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a big drop-off , waist-high in timothy grass . The sun was setting , and Sassy saw what she 'd always seen , where she 'd played as a child . Beyond the drop-off , mountains . Griswold walked with her to the gray boulder . He brushed a place with his hand and sat her there , then sat beside her . Dig with your feet . Do what ? Slide them back and forth . Make places . So we will always have been here . Sassy watched Griswold slide his feet back and forth . She had to do it too . The two of them pushed their feet back and forth like children . Long , narrow ridgebacks slid away , one behind another . Now outcroppings of rock and earth , inside bones all stone . Now swirls of pine and balsam . Glittering lakes and dead gorges . Forest and brush fell away as the rock they sat on shoved them into the sky . Silent air , with that huge , gaping hole below . But quiet they were too , above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its throat ? Feel big or little in the dusk , depends . Mountains change a body . So yes , make footprints . Then say it later . There I was , once . Know hard mountains , like all must . Live here , and accept death before it comes . Do n't see the black bat against a pale moon . Study no sign . Of good , or bad . Or both together , all at oncet , or now . Call life mountain gloom and mountain glory , and death will take care of itself . Live here like birds , from ravens to finches . Look here , look there , fly here , fly there , into the brush , the maple tree , and finally the sky , to come no more . Our miseries no different from anybody else 's , just higher up . Try hard but not too hard ; birds wo n't . Do n't give a damn , and soon you wo n't . Slide your feet , and leave your trace , and let the mind alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard but , God damn you , piss-elegant mountains . Think kindly of men and women who live on them for a little while before they get old and die . Z is for Zack . He climbed up a tree . His good Lord to see . The tree was tall , he had a fall . And never seen his Lord at all . If you require no abundance , you can squander all opinion . And accept death before it comes . Sassy and Griswold , two shadows , sitting on a rock . That black mountain night swallowed them like a frog does bugs . They got down from the rock . Their hands met . In the darkness Griswold pointed to the footprints they made . You and me . In the wagon , on a bridal bed made from her two best sheets , Sassy first submitted with teeth gritted . Then she realized she was not unhappy about this man . He took his time . But she was having the thoughts women have with men . Something to do with the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the act of pleasure is done half with someone else , somewhere else . No , it was you , and your husband or your wife , and yourself . Thinking about what , while breeding ? If I ca n't be a tablecloth I wo n't be a dishrag if I 'm too poor to paint I 'll be too proud to whitewash tell me you love me so I wo n't allow I hear it I 'm too proud to fancy you too vain to deny you but I am married now all that is over let it go all my pride all my days times I recall when if it happen you pass while enduring my time I wonder me if over your ridge and down far lands across meeting who under a green shaddergum tree all that is over I made a bargain I 'll keep it whar all to Then , for awhile , a river ran through their wedding night . It was deep , and Sassy was content with it . But there was that something else . She heard , jumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she saw her mother and father looking at her . Then it got late and very cold . Sassy and Griswold pressed themselves together and slept . Nine , honeymoon . Yiiiiii ! said Sassy . They traveled . How long is this going to last ? We 've been on these godforsaken trails past six weeks now . Ai n't we done forty mile yet ? Then there was a store . No sign , just a never-painted , one-window shack maybe ten feet wider and deeper than a cabin . You do n't go in there . Women do n't go in the store . I did at home . With your daddy and brothers . Here it 's me and you . Good-looking woman . Think you 're mean . Kind of man hereabout take after you , wish you 'd never been born . When Griswold came out , helping him load was the benastiest  --  looking man Sassy had ever seen . She shivered . A day after that , Griswold stopped the wagon . This is our place . Hundred two acre , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six lindens somewhere yonder . There 's a triple oak beyond where I see the top of that rise we own , and twenty acres over . We 'll walk the boundaries tomorrow . Lay some fencing . I can commence clearing . Hush , hear the creek ? It 's over there . No , over there . Ten , house . Salt . Seed . Flour . Flour sacks . Hemp . Tar . Kerosene . Wicks . Lamp . Matches . Pipe tobacco . Strip leather . Nails . Broadcloth . Needles . Thread . Cord . The first thing you do , with strip leather , is make a sling . You take it to the creek and drag rocks with it . That makes a chimney . And that makes a fire . Sassy and Griswold sat by their rock chimney with firelit faces . For a strange man , your husband , plant corn and beans . Build a sled , hitch it to your mule . Slide it ever'where . Girdle trees , axe notched through the bark so they die . Cut them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't warp . Build your cabin , one room , but a big one , center-beamed even , notched corners , a piece of porch wide enough to rock a slat chair on . Make your bed with the dry wood , some rope , your mattress with a flour-sack tick packed with wildflowers and pine straw until the first crop of corn , then husks . Later you 'll have ducks , can sleep on feathers . Clear your land . Split-rail fence it . Plant more corn and beans . With a strange man , your husband , endure the rain . Treasure the sun . Fear the snow . Griswold ! My daddy delivered my momma . Me and my sister and my brother . We lived . Eleven . birth . Sassy was in labor . Griswold knelt before her , holding her legs apart . He moved her hip sockets , to soften the bones . How will you cut the cord ? With my knife . Wipe it off , for Christ 's sake ? I 'll bum the blade . Cut the cord with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep it covered with burned cloth . Cord will rot off , leaving a belly button clean and shapely , so I was told . You do n't know what you 're doing . A midwife at least , or a granny woman , somebody ! Trouble is midwives do n't keep things clean . I knowed one grabbing for the afterbirth herself with grimy hands , and the mother died . You ai n't a-going to die . Baby 's head 's coming first , I can feel it . I mean , if you take about four crates and stack them , knock them together , and take out their bottoms and tops , and if you just slant them this way and that , then , my Daddy showed me how , you can push a rag dolly through it , and it comes out right . I been told it . Agony came , in her shoulder of all places , and then the birth pain contracted her . It took her bottom and top , then went away slow , like rain stopping . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Sassy swept out and clean , Griswold calculated , like a clean , empty farmhouse on land good for an early crop . Griswold did cut the cord with his pocketknife , his eyeballs falling out of his head , but he did cut it , tied it off both times in the right place , so you have to say this much for the man-not only were his hands clean , but his rags were washed out and scorched black over the fire he kept going like a furnace . There was a shallow pine bowl he had whittled out , and ready he was to wash the baby in warmed-up water , and dress it himself . Men here go to pieces , slip , slide , cut and run . It is like having a baby while your husband has a nap , and they have done that , too , terrified and unconscious . But Griswold went about midwifery calm and smiling . He held up their bloody creature , jiggled then whopped it alive . It was a girl . He washed her off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dressed her in more clean rags , not scorched , just warm . He gave the baby a spoonful of ginger-root tea , to clear that throat . Finally , the baby got to suck . Griswold Plankman would not let his wife work for three whole days . Unheard of here , where most are up and washing in one . Sassy said , Plain luck . Anything at all bad happened , a breech , or the afterbirth growing on her insides , what would he have done ? She 'd be dead , baby dead . She swore she would never again let him do this to her . But what she could not say was that there was n't the living child in her arms , at her breasts sucking strong , a fat infant improperly but functionally born as if it really did slide down Griswold 's stacked wooden crates , his harebrained idea of a woman 's insides , bumping down and out slick and mannerly in a carpenter-smooth notion of the muckslide-bloodslide of birth . Not only that , the baby grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their one happy child . Twelve , four days . About three months later , her husband in the field , she lay down naked on a cornhusk mattress , gave Rachael Ann her milk . Belched her , then laid the baby facedown betwixt her breasts , aspraddle , naked mother naked baby breathing smooth , blood thumping , asleep together . Sassy woke to see Griswold standing above them . She thought she would tell her husband he could go to hell , she was n't getting up , they were sleeping . But Griswold , before she could say it , turned without a word and went back to his field . That night he came wordless to his corn and coffee , got up from it , and sat the evening away on the footstep of the house , one hand clutching each knee , staring at something he had never suspected . The second day he was worse . Not only did he not go that morning to the field , but he asked , asked , if he could sit quiet and just watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning away . Sassy said , Yes , sir , he could , and he did . This was not manly mountain behavior . Griswold worked in the afternoon but got home way before dusk . He asked her to sit on the front step and not say anything while he cooked supper . After they ate , he went into the dark woods , came back an hour later with a piece of gum log he had bark-shaved and hollowed into a cradle . He put Rachael Ann in it , where she turned over once , and gone she was into that sleep that favored her as long as they could keep her . The third day got worse . Griswold came home at noon , said something confused , took Rachael Ann in his arms , walked out the door and off into the brush . Sassy looked after him , exasperated and anxious , until she saw it . It was a lunatic showing the world to a baby . That whole afternoon , taking a three-month-old baby here and taking her there , explaining in swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man talking , all sorts of things no baby could comprehend but maybe could feel . This here is your leaf mold , Griswold said aloud , bending over and showing Rachael Ann some dirt . Up as high as we are , best stay below waterfalls with plenty of leaf mold or you 'll grow one crop of bad corn , eat it , get sick , and have to move . Sometimes a fire 'll do it , burn down through the leaf mold , and it 's ruination . Ca n't have that . God almighty , Sassy said . Griswold explained in detail to Rachael Ann how his plow , harrow , scythe , great ax , and hoe all functioned , one different from the next . Then he went from tools to trees . Rachael , this here is hickory . That there is oak . Your hickory is tougher . Locust over here , and it do n't rot , so use it close to the ground . Careful what you cut . Some stumps are the devil , others come out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . She ai n't going to build no cabin , said Sassy . She 's a baby and a woman , not a man . It was as if he heard nothing , so intent was he on being , it finally occurred to Sassy , not so much a man being manly with a daughter instead of a son , but , well , a lordly , goodly , hostly man , generous in **25;1549;TOOLONG . But this was with their infant daughter , for Christ 's sweet sake , who lived there anyhow . Griswold named every last tree on his land , in a mad obsession of fatherhood . Up one side of his property and down the other Griswold took that baby , it drowsy part of the time but big-eyed awake some of it , too , and even intent in her father 's arms , as if listening closely to what he had to say . Sassy did not know whether to smile or worry . Finally he took Rachael Ann into the house , to tell her where everything was . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Rachael Ann in her gum-tree cradle . Welcome . Then he went out to plow . The fourth day ended it . There was a sudden gust of dawn rain . After it came wind and a bright day , with all their trees blown sideways and back . Griswold had done nothing all that day . He had , it seemed , passed into some back of beyond in his own head and sat again on the porch steps , not moving except for both his hands , twitching , turning over and back , as if letting things go . Have you given up farming ? Four days , said Griswold , and went back to the plow . Thirteen , Malcom . Go on , yell ! I 'll die ! And a boy lay in her arms , clean , washed by Griswold in the wooden basin he 'd carved for Rachael . Griswold cleaned his knife again , after he had cut her cord . Sassy nursed their son . They named him Malcom . Fourteen , time . Slow . Fast . Fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Husband . Babies . Farm . Fifteen , visitor . Sassy heard Griswold from the field , a noise that never came out of him before . When she got to him , he was on his knees , one hand holding himself off the ground , the other pressing guts and blood back inside his stomach . Get me rags Sassy ran to the cabin , tore up some clothes , and came back fast as she could . Blood was streaming through Griswold 's fingers . Tearing cloth , Sassy packed the wound . I turned my back on my mule . Kicked me onto the harrow . Stuff that in ! Griswold and Sassy stanched the blood by packing the cloth in and around the wound , but it did " not hold . Could he walk ? Griswold tried to get up . His eyes shut , and he fainted . Sassy held her husband , a dead weight . She could n't lift him . Blood seeped out around the . rags . She tried to.haul him and could n't . The wound was wide open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She had not heard him coming . It was as if he dropped from the sky . Griswold tried to see who was there and could n't . But he heard the man 's voice . He said nothing . The man helped Sassy get Griswold on his feet . His arms gripped Griswold around the side , holding him upright , elbows packing in the rags at the same time . He walked Griswold into the cabin , where Sassy boiled water . Griswold drank some corn whiskey , and they washed the would . Where 's his saw ? The man went outside , sawed wood , came back with a contraption . It was like a big clothespin . They washed then clamped the wound shut with two slabs of wood and two bent nails . It was like a pair of pliers . They waited for one hour . Together they opened the clamp , stitched the wound with needle and thread like any sackcloth dress , and clamped it shut again . The wound was deep but clean . Griswold opened his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't say nothing about it . Griswold closed his eyes and seemed to faint again . Now Sassy could look at this man , dropped out of the sky . Who was he ? Griswold moaned and twisted about . Then he was still , as if unconscious again , but he was n't . She was more aware of this man now . He was looking about her like a polite gentleman will when he wants a woman . Sassy wiped sweat from Griswold 's face . That night , when Sassy was asleep , Griswold and that man crept out of the cabin together . Feverish , aching every step , Griswold still got down to the river with that man , and in the moonlight by the creek they faced each other . What are you doing here ? What are you ? Now , you 'd think she'd'a seen . That something else . But she was charmed . Glad her husband was alive , and another man in the world to smile at her . You never know how close you are . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , the man was gone . Sixteen , neighbors . There was the call from the edge of their yard , and the powerful exchange of Hidys . They could see Griswold ponder them and decide if it was sooner or later , it might as well be now . Spencer Shook said , Spencer Shook . Wife Abby , daughter Hester . This here is the Bladen family , this here the Wilders , and that there Mullins people . Live maybe three mile off . Plankman , Griswold and Sassy . Babies Rachael and Malcom . Another'n on the way . Calculate we are the closest souls anywhere near you . Got a poke for you in the wagon . Peaches , bee-gum honey , molasses , salted deer , and a few helpfuls . Griswold Plankman jumped on that . He plain herded them out to their wagon , leaving Sassy behind , and told them the way it was , the way he wanted it to stay . The men agreed , and that was that . The women did n't like it , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Sassy . Seventeen , friend . It was some time later Hester Shook had a frank talk with Sassy Plankman . She was not your walleyed , spindly-legged , thirty-year-old castoff , where men low-rate women the day they hit sixteen . She was just twenty , and a better-looking woman you never saw . But there was bad trouble to it , disgraceful . I ca n't be wild . I can not abide a man naked . Coming at me looking like a tree with a stump sticking out of it that close to the ground . I live at home , and will forever . But I 'd treasure a good neighbor . Hester , give me your hand . Hester did , and the two women stood there like men buying and selling , but that is not what those women were doing . So we ai n't alone now , Sassy said . Hester swallowed and said no . Eighteen , Giasticus bones . This was when Rachael and Malcom were about eight and six , Sarah three . Sarah was n't in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachael and Malcom , playing , brought two old crates , covered with canvas , to their mother and father . Spring rains had undermined the creek-bank . They 'd put what they 'd found in the crates . Sassy laughed . Giasticus bones-that 's the bird with a ten-foot tooth and the fifty  --  foot wingspread , what carries off cows , she said . Then a head they pulled out of one crate . Jesus Lord , said Sassy . Chilluns , said Griswold , what you found was some man who likely fell on creek rocks years ago , washed down in the spring rains , and got buried in the clay . This year 's rush uncovered him . What 's in the other crate ? Bones with clay still on them . And black stuff , said the children . Cover his face , said Griswold . Go back down to the creek and dig a hole . Away from the water this time . Shovel 's back of the house . Go on . The children got the shovel and went to dig the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a bitch . His name was Goudy , killed a man named Pringle , I think it was . Would have us . I got him down to the creek , where my sickle lay upside the " simmon tree . You cut off his head . And chopped him in pieces , and stuck him six feet down in clay . These rains dug him up . Why ? He would have told you things before he killed you . The children had dug the hole . Younguns . You take these bones back down to the creek and shovel him in , ten feet this time , and let him be . Take the Bible out of the house , hold it , and say him something . And the children did that while Sassy stared slack-jawed at Griswold and him at her . She 'd once thought him just simple . He 'd thought her just wild . But he was hard under his jokes . She was soft under her feistiness . Things move , in marriage . She was astonished at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No you did n't . Yes I did . Nineteen , summertime . It was sunup . Griswold and Sassy stood on their porch . Griswold had just hayed his fields . There was the smell of fresh grass around them . Griswold put his arm around Sassy 's shoulders . They were at peace . And God made the roads of this world so crooked , a man and his wife ca n't always tell if their life is going somewheres grand or jest coming back home . Weather is changeable , and marrieds ca n't always tell wet from windy . Back home now , sunshine in the morning , breezy and pleasant . There is always a squirrel in a tree somewheres . They stood together , looking at the morning sun . Dog days came later , but right then it was summertime pleasant , and so were they to each other . Stretch , get warm , find sun . But Sassy felt , in her husband 's arm around her , a hard hold , making her uneasy . Twenty , rattlesnakes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sassy yelled for Griswold . They laid Malcom down on a quilt on the porch . Keep him on his stomach , said Spencer Shook . On his back , the poison moves faster . Sassy did what was told . Griswold came running , as did Rachael behind him . He 'd had her on his shoulders , plowing . They all gathered around Malcom . He had to fight for his breath ; it was that bad . He had been playing with the Shook boys on the Shook place , in plain sight of Spencer Shook and Ab Mullins , who happened by . In his shoulder , said Ab Mullins . Another'n in his jaw , jest over his throat . Twicet at once . I want to say copperhead , but diamondbacks is what they was . Tell by the marks . Around here , big as your arm . Snakes ? said Sassy . Cut and suck him , said Griswold . No good to it , said Spencer Shook . Griswold had out his barlow knife . He found the bites . He cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sucked those wounds , first one then the other . Spencer Shook watched him do it . Mr. Plankman . Griswold paid him no mind . And in deed and truth , two diamondback rattlesnakes came off a waist-high ledge at Malcom . Both bit him the same split second . One hung long enough for Ab Mullins , on the run the minute he saw it happen , to knock the serpent down . Griswold tried to turn Malcom over , on his back . Ab Mullins and Spencer Shook helped , shaking their heads . Griswold cut and sucked the wound on Malcom 's jaw , spitting blood and poison . They stood there , watching what would be , and worse to come . Ca n't hardly breathe atall now , said Ab Mullins . Spencer Shook said , Griswold . Cutting and sucking for the diamondback wo n't do . Copperheads , adders even , but not.diamondbacks . That venom 's inside him . He 's black in places , see , said Ab Mullins . You 'll jest disfigure the boy , said Spencer Shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , deep now , above and below the neck and then again into his shoulder . Malcom screamed , bit his lip till blood came there too . Griswold sucked the cuts , spit , sucked again and again , then cut again . More screams , more sucking . It was like something awful in a whorehouse . Sassy said , Griswold , no more ! He 's commencing to swell up , said Ab Mullins . If he 's lucky , what went into his leg and jaw will bust his heart . If not , take longer . That venom scalds open the veins . Fills your body with blood . That 's what 's black , said Spencer Shook . Painfullest way any soul leaves this earth , said Ab Mullins . Griswold wanted to kill them both , talking like they were buying horses . But Sassy saw they were right . Stop , Griswold . And then that boy looked at his mother with the most peculiar look she had ever seen . Can I tell her ? It was an argument they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want , said Griswold . No , the boy said , but he said it like a man . I 'll need to witness some kind of a yes from him , said Spencer Shook . It 's the law . Son ? said Griswold . Understand ? Yes , sir , Malcom said . That 'll do , said Spencer Shook . Kiss him , said Griswold , and Sassy did . Ca n't be no bullets in him , said Spencer Shook . It 's the law . Make it a crime , said Ab Mullins . Do what you was doing with your knife , said Spencer Shook . Only way my brother got freed from it . Malcom screamed . Venom , said Ab Mullins , is breaking down his veins . Griswold hit Malcom hard on the head with the butt of the knife . Malcom 's eyes closed . Griswold cut his son 's throat . Push on him , said Spencer Shook . Griswold pushed down on Malcom 's body , and a great gush of black blood poured out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty-one , grief . For many days , Griswold worked himself near death , ate hardly a mouthful of anything , then just sat sleepless . He would n't move . He would n't talk . Who could blame the man , had to do a thing like that ? Watch over him , see he do n't do the same to hisself . Say , My God , this life , and get some tea . Until Griswold said , God damn this , and went on like he 'd never had a son , leaving Sassy to grieve alone , for the longest time . Twenty-two , Rachael . Time came . Momma ? Sassy kissed her daughter , who went off to marry the Carson boy at what was said to be a Carson family celebration too far for her and Griswold to go to . Peculiar thing , that a woman so feisty when young did n't just get worse , grow old more of the same , but turned around and became so quiet and calm she 'd said yes to a thing like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what Sassy always believed a far-off family . Rachael died young , a worn-out wife . Nobody told her mother . Some tried to , but could n't . Sassy wondered and even asked a time or two why her daughter never came home . Then Sarah , the same . There it was , and it stayed that way . Neighbors said nothing . They got old , died , some of them . Others would see Griswold come to the store for nails and coffee . Sassy stayed home , as always . Twenty-three , anniversary . Forty-five year in Tennessee , said Griswold . And you did bring me here . Yes , I did . They both outlived their children . Griswold was eighty-one when he fell and cut himself on a sickle . Twenty-four , widow . When Old Man Griswold Plankman died , his wife , Sassy Layman Plankman , stayed up two nights sewing by her own hand a thick winding sheet of some quality . Then neighbors helped her bury him , in one of his fields . And how could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man was dead . But it had just gone on too long , and they could n't . Old Maid Hester Shook went lots to keep Sassy company . I 'm powerful uneasy . You 're grieving . Got the fidgets , bad . Go where ? What for ? I do n't know . Do n't try to leave Tennessee . You could get lost. , But something is eating at me . Stay where you are . Right here . Twenty-five , joke . So now you can see it all again like when they started , from where black ravens slide down updrafts , the two ridges , one from where the old woman came , the other where the family farms , where she tells them this life of hers , holding on to that cowbell , wheezing , coughing , ca n't stop talking because whilst they are listening and wondering , she is still traveling , this time in her own head , where , slow and cold as ice , comprehension comes slowly aborning . I commenced little walks , said Sassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was loose in country she 'd never seen before that she had seen before . She was wandering in her pitiful old age , at the same time finding real places of powerful remembrance . I was coming here , said Sassy . That ca n't be , said the husband . Tennessee is forty mile off . But they were all around her , in the woods and clearings . In mountain dusk , with the farm family on that porch , she saw them all again . Momma , Poppa , Billy , Ab , my sister Rachael and my daughters Rachael and Sarah , my son Malcom and my Griswold . I found this cowbell . On some cow , two days " walk , not hardly seven mile . I heared the waterfall ) Carson 's Falls . Where I played as a child . My daughter married a boy named Carson and left home to go far away and I never laid eyes on her again . Then the tree . Sassy held up that piece of broken mirror . That tree , she recollected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maple , with a piece of mirror stuck in a burl grown all around it . Where her husband put it , broken , on their wedding day . She had looked at her face in it . Young bride , old woman . Two flashes of one mirror . Great God a'mighty . She 's loony , said the wife . One day in Tennessee , and the next Carson 's Falls ? And the same road all overgrown . A road she ran down every day of her young life ? Then she come out of the brush , into the clearing right over yonder . The house . The boy . That man , said Sassy . That damn man . They did n't see it . They were just watching her ring her bell and stamp her feet . They heard her say scoundrel and Goddamned bastard all in aL pouring-out of hard feelings mixed up before them in whoops and a raging comprehension . It was the boy , the boy , who said it , before his father and mother , and said it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee at all . God . He put you in a wagon . God . And drove you around in circles , in these same mountains . And settled where he meant to all along ? said the wife . On his own land ? said the husband . Seven mile off , said the boy . You never got to Tennessee at all . Sassy looked at each of them in turn , seeing behind them her own husband and children , and her mother and father and her brothers and sisters . You thought you were in Tennessee , but you was n't , said the boy . God . Were they all in on it ? My dead son , when he was dying ? My daughters , who walked off from me without hardly one word ? My Momma , Poppa , seven mile away for fifty years ? Getting me married , getting me gone I Griswold , you never told me what you done to me . You never would have told mel By God , you died without telling meI She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her breath . Whoo , said Sassy . Shoo . She looked at the family , on its estate . She looked at the cowbell and the mirror in her hands . She dropped the mirror and the cowbell at her feet and started off . Give me the baby , said the husband . I 'm hungry now . The husband took the baby and went into his house . His wife followed and shut the door . The boy picked up the cowbell and the mirror and followed Sassy . Twenty-six , powerful remembrance . He was fearful of getting caught by darkness in the mountains alone , but it was almost a full moon , so he kept on , since he just wanted to . She went to the bald . She sat there in dusk turning to night , on an outcropping of ridge rock on the edge of the bluff , surrounded by timothy grass gray in the moonlight . Under the shadow of falling night , the terraces of land spread in darkness beyond her for miles and miles , not in blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was moving her feet back and forth . He sat next to her , and she let him . He set his feet to the ground with hers and pushed them back and forth . He knew about footprints ; boys do . They make trails through the brush , saying , See , I am here too . In the dusk the boy could see his face in the piece of mirror . If I ca n't be a tablecloth , I wo n't be a dishrag . If I 'm too poor to paint I 'll be too proud to whitewash . If it happen you pass . Whar all to ? Mountains do n't answer such as that . The boy saw his face dark in the mirror . Something like a raven flew across the moon .
