Chapter One How can I be a widow ? Widows wear horn-rimmed glasses and cardigan sweaters that smell like mothballs and have crepe-paper skin and names like Gladys or Midge and meet with their other widow friends once a week to play pinochle . I 'm only thirty-six . I just got used to the idea of being married , only test-drove the words my husband for three years : My husband and I , my husband and I ... after all that time being single ! As we go around the room introducing ourselves at the grief group , my heart drums in my chest . No wonder people fear public speaking more than death or heights or spiders . I rehearse a few lines in my head : My name is Sophie and I live in San Jose and my husband died . No . My name is Sophie and my husband passed away of Hodgkin 's disease , which is a type of cancer young adults get . Oh , but they probably already know that . This group seems up on its diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now when he gets up in the morning he does n't have to poach his wife 's egg or run her bath , and he does n't see the point in getting out of bed . He weeps without making a sound , tears quivering in his eyes , then escaping down his unshaven cheeks . He looks at the floor and kneads his sweater in his hands , which are pink and spotted like luncheon meat . We sit in a circle of folding chairs in a conference room at the hospital , everyone sipping coffee out of Styrofoam cups and hugging their coats in their laps . Fluorescent lights buzz overhead . They are bright and cruel , exposing the group 's despair : the puffy faces , circles under the eyes like bruised fruit , dampened spirits that no longer want to sing along with the radio . There should be a rule for grief groups : forty-watt bulbs only . The social worker who leads the group balances a clipboard on her knees and takes notes . She has one tooth that is grayer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , hollow ? I want to leap up and tap it with my fingernail . Surely she 's got dental insurance . Why does n't she fix that tooth ? My name is Sophie and I 've joined the grief group because ... well , because I sort of did a crazy thing . I drove my Honda through our garage door . I was coming home from work one night and- even though my husband has been dead for three months-I honestly thought I would run inside and tell him to turn on the radio because they were playing an old recording of Flip Wilson , whom he just loves . Loved . Ethan had been trying to find a copy of this skit for years , and now here it was on the radio . If I hurried , we could tape it . Then I had the sudden realization that my husband was gone , dead , and the next thing I knew the car was lurching through the door . The wood creaked and crunched as I worked the car into reverse and backed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , " And maybe we have a banana for your monkey ! " and the audience roared . My shrink , Dr. Rupert , pointed out later that I could have hurt myself or someone else and insisted I join this group . The Indian woman sitting next to me lost her twin sister , who was hit and killed by a drunk driver . Her long black braids hang like elegant tassels down the back of her pumpkin-colored sari . She says she and her sister shared a room until they left home , and after that they talked to each other every day on the telephone . Now she dreams that the phone is ringing in the middle of the night . But when she awakens the house is silent ; she picks up the phone and no one is there and she ca n't fall back to sleep and she 's exhausted during the day . She hears phones ringing everywhere , in the car , at work , at the store . Now , she shudders and cups her ears with her slender brown fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when she picks up someone will be on the other end . Suddenly everyone in the circle is looking at me expectantly , and I wish I 'd had a little more time to prepare for the meeting before racing here from work . I can feel my uncooperative curly brown hair puffing in crazy directions , as if it wants to leave the room . On some days it forms silky ringlets , on others Roseanne Roseanna-danna frizz . " My name is Sophie Stanton and my husband died of cancer three months ago ... , " I stammer , tucking my fingers into the curls . My voice sounds loud and warbly in the too bright room . I try to talk and hold in my stomach at the same time , because my slacks are unbuttoned under my sweater to accommodate a waistline swollen from overmedicating with frozen waffles ; I think I feel the zipper creeping down my former size six belly . That seems like enough for now , anyway . " Thank you , " I add , not wanting to seem unfriendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Her voice is as high and sweet as a Mouseketeer 's . Maybe later I 'll tell the group how I dream about Ethan every night . That he 's still alive in the eastern standard time zone and if I fly to New York , I can see him for another three hours . That I 'm mixing chocolate and strawberry Ensure into a muddy potion that will restore his hemoglobin . When I wake at three or four in the morning , my nightgown is soaked and stuck to my back and the walls pulse around me . But by the time I get to Dr. Rupert 's office , I 've sunk into a zombie calm . It 's sort of like when you bring your car into the shop and it stops making that troublesome noise . Dr. Rupert says to keep busy . For the past three months I 've been rushing from work to various activities : a book club , a pottery class , volunteer outings for the Audubon Society . We rescued a flock of sandpipers on the beach . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the birds reared and stumbled and flapped their wings as we scooped them into crates . I rented a Rototiller and turned over the hard , dry earth at the very back of our yard and planted sunflowers and cosmos that shot straight through the September heat toward the sky . Everyone said how well I was doing , how brave I was . Then I drove my car through the garage door . " Screw the birds ! " I yelled at Dr. Rupert in my session that afternoon . " Screw the books , screw the sunflowers ! " He scribbled on his little pad , then told me about this group . There are fifteen of us in the circle . My eyes scan the sets of feet , counting : two , four , six , eight , ten . Two , four , six , eight , ten . Two , four , six , eight , ten . Thirty feet . Fifteen people . Hush Puppies and Reeboks and penny loafers . The group meets at the hospital where Ethan died . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything about this place . How Ethan lay in bed , gray and speckly as a trout . The smells of rubbing alcohol and canned peas and souring flower arrangements . The patients , wrapped like mummies , being wheeled on gurneys through the halls . The monotone pages over the PA , the operator saying things like " Code five hundred " and " Dr. So-and-So to surgery " as calmly as if she were reporting a spill in aisle six . Great idea ! Let 's go back to the hospital once a week . You remember the hospital . Now everyone is looking at me again , and the social worker is saying something . " Pardon ? " " What did your husband do , Sophie ? " I push my glasses up on my nose ( a little problem with oversleeping prevents me from wearing my contact lenses these days ) and peer out at the circle of forlorn faces . " He was a software engineer . " " I see . " She adds that to her yellow pad . How odd to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like sweets , he did eat sugared cereals , I want to tell her . His feet were goofy . A couple of those toes looked like peanuts , really . And what a slob . You would not want to ride in his car , because it smelled like sour milk and you 'd be ankle-deep in take-out wrappers and dirty coffee mugs . He loved Jerry Lewis movies . One movie made him laugh so hard that beer shot out of his nose . I fight to suppress a giggle as I think of this . Or maybe it 's a scream . A dangerous tickle lurks in the back of my throat , and I check to see how close the door is , in case I need to escape . " And how did you two meet ? " Unfortunately I am clear on the other side of the room from the door , stranded in this circle of feet . A pair of laid-back Birkenstocks scoffs at my uptight career pumps . I clear my throat . " While I was visiting college friends here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me at dinner , moving someone else 's plate to another spot while the person was in the kitchen and wedging himself in beside me . Geez , I thought . Strangely overconfident software geek . " How nice . Did you date from afar at first , then ? " " Yes , we had a long-distance relationship for a year , then I moved here and we lived together for a year and then we married . " " Very good . " I feel as if I could have said we were embezzlers and the social worker would have thought that was nice . A few of the other women are widows , too , but they 're older than me . One has white hair and glasses with lenses as big as coasters that magnify her eyes , making them look like pale blue stones underwater . There 's a man whose wife was killed in a car accident on Highway 1 , and his ten-year-old daughter is having her first sleep-over party this weekend . She told him this morning that she hated him because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted Mad Libs at her party , and why did her mother have to die and not him since he 's so stupid ? The man 's voice speeds up and his Styrofoam cup cracks as he squeezes it . A dribble of coffee leaks onto his khakis . He tells us about the dozen girls coming to sleep in his family room this Saturday night and how he wants to surprise his daughter with an ice-cream cake ; he 's pretty sure that 's what she wants , but his wife did n't leave any notes about the party and he 's afraid to ask his daughter because he does n't want to upset her any more . " I think she likes mint chocolate chip , " he says , looking down , his pink double chin folding over the stiff collar of his white work-shirt , which looks impossibly tight . I want to squeeze his plump hand and tell him it 's going to be all right . I know , because I was thirteen when my mother died in a car accident on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fend for ourselves . That was my first experience with death , and I wished then that I 'd gotten a dress rehearsal with a distant , elderly relative . A great-aunt Dolores whose whiskery kisses I dreaded . The only death experience before my mother was my hamster , George , who somehow got confused and ate all of the cedar chips in his cage . I came home from school to find him lying still as a stuffed animal , his water bottle dripping on his head . But there was a new hamster by that weekend who performed all of the old hamster 's tricks : running in his wheel and fidgeting with his apple slice and popping his head through a toilet paper roll . " The death of a loved one is n't really something you ever get over , " the group leader explains , leaning forward in her chair . She wears a fluffy white angora sweater with a cowl neck reaching to her chin , so it looks as though her head is resting on a cloud . " Instead , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you think of . " While I know she 's right , I ca n't imagine that this morning will ever come to my house . By now , everyone in the group is sniffling and honking , and a box of Kleenex is making the rounds . As the gold foil box comes my way , I pull out several tissues and hold the wad in my hand like a bouquet . But I 'm the only one in the circle who is n't crying . You do n't cry at a scary movie , do you ? Dr. Rupert thinks the group will help me move from denial to anger to bargaining to depression to acceptance to hope to lingerie to housewares to gift wrap . But it seems the elevator is stuck . For the past three months I 've been lodged in the staring-out- **28;1262;TOOLONG stage of grief . Now my cuticles demand my attention . Pick at us , they insist . Yank away . Do n't mind the blood . Keep going . At last , a use for Kleenex . As I blot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says you have to find ways to release your anger . " Keep a box of garage-sale dishes you do n't care about , " she suggests . " And break them when you 're upset . " She says you can lay down a blanket and throw the dishes at the garage , then roll the whole thing up when you 're done . She 's enthusiastic about how easy this is , as if she 's relaying a remarkably simple recipe . It 's hard to imagine her stepping on an ant , let alone breaking a service for twelve . Would it be all right if I threw dishes at my former mother-in-law ? I want to ask the counselor . Marion , Ethan 's mother , calls every other day now to insist that she come over and help me pack up Ethan 's stuff for Goodwill . I dread the thought of her snoopy paws all over his Frank Zappa CDs and Lakers T-shirts . She 'd probably want to chuck his frayed flannel shirts , which I 've started sleeping in because they 're as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house is as neat as a museum . The only trace of the past is one family photo on the baby grand piano . It was taken the day of Ethan 's college graduation , and he stands between Marion and Charlie , his father , who died a few months later of a heart attack . Ethan 's smiling and the tassel on his graduation cap is airborne , as if it might propel him through the future . Marion looks up at him , bursting with awe . Marion 's always needling me to get ahold of myself . " You have to get back on the horse , dear ! " she 'll chirp . " Chin up , chin up ! " Get-your-act-together euphemisms that say , Look , I 'm a widow , too , and now I 've lost my only son , but you do n't see me driving through my garage door or inhaling pralines and cream out of the carton for break-fast . I would like to bean Marion with a gravy boat . Now , even the men are weeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress here . I 'll bet tears are to a grief counselor what straight teeth are to an orthodontist . Still , dry eyes for me . Maybe I need the remedial grief group . Maybe there 's a book , The Idiot 's Guide to Grief . Or Denial for Dummies . Maybe this is going to be like ice-skating backward , which I never got the hang of . Or like Girl Scouts , which I got kicked out of for having a poor attitude . I did n't have any badges and was n't enthusiastic about making my coffee-can camp stove and would n't wear that Patty Hearst beret while selling cookies . ( It was hot and made your ears itch ! ) The troop leader , Mrs. Swensen , called my mother to say that I should find an after-school activity I was more enthusiastic about . She did n't know that I had been working on the cooking badge . Continues ...
