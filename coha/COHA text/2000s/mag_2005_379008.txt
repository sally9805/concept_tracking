AMERICA 'S HOUSE PARTY <P> The cover report on the U.S. 's real estate bonanza and the way record home prices are changing people 's lives drew responses from happy homeowners , worried prospective buyers and those dismayed by the rampant speculation . Some said the housing market is a bubble that 's bound to break <P> Your article on the country 's love affair with the housing market did a fantastic job of pointing out those who played the speculation game and won June 13 . Such booms , unfortunately , are often followed by busts . Real estate may be safer than stocks or other investments , but to assume that this gold rush will continue forever is naive . <P> BRIAN M. STARNS - Portland , Ore . <P> As a real estate appraiser for nearly 30 years , I consider the housing market so bizarrely bent that it 's seriously Enron-esque . When banks start loaning money to anybody who can sign his or her name , the end of the boom is rapidly approaching . All the greedy little lenders want every available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sorry to say I am disgusted by what a thoroughly dishonest nation of money-hungry fools we Americans have become . <P> SUZANNE MURPHY - Southampton , N.Y . <P> Your story on rising property values on a block of Chicago 's North Wood Street reminded me of my grandfather , a Polish-Lithuanian immigrant who lived on North Wood and kept his money in the walls of his house rather than bank it . If he were alive , I 'm sure he would be scolding my Uncle Adam for selling the property for a mere $22,000 a few years back . Who would have thought that reading an article about real estate would awaken such a flood of memories ? <P> PENELOPE HELENICK ADDY - Van Nuys , Calif . <P> Until I read about the crazy housing market , I thought I was the only one living in a place where people make real estate deals with money they do n't have . Unless I become a movie star or join a drug ring , I will probably never have enough money to own a house in a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Americans ' greed is pitiful . People who speculate on housing while others remain homeless are shallow in the extreme . Tearing down perfectly good houses to build huge , gaudy mansions is wasteful , immoral and counterproductive . People must understand that the only difference between a homeless person and a person who inhabits the largest house in Beverly Hills is four walls . <P> RICHARD REBHUN - Los Angeles <P> You reported on the teardown craze in Brentwood Flats , Calif . We live next door to an 11,000-sq. - ft. mansion being built on a 16,000-sq. - ft. lot . The only thing more massive than the structure is the owner 's ego . <P> BARBARA KLASKIN SILBERG - Los Angeles <P> Not a day goes by that my wife and I , proud parents of a new baby boy , do n't relish the fact that we bought our house before its value made it too expensive . <P> JOHN POLAGRUTO - West Sacramento , Calif . <P> Out of the Shadows                 @ @ @ @
