THOUGH A daily siesta can increase productivity and relieve stress  --  " If I do n't nap , I 'll have a horrible game , " says Warriors guard Jason Richardson  --  not everyone enjoys the practice . " That 's like stuff you do when you 're a little kid , " says Richardson 's teammate , for ward Ike Diogu . Still , for many professional athletes ( especially NBA and NHL players ) dozing for a spell between morning practices and evening games is part of their daily regimen . Says Kings defenseman Aaron Miller ( who wears jersey number 3 and tends to set his afternoon alarm for 3:33 ) , " I think about all the time I 'd have if I did n't nap , but , then , everyone does it . It 's a nice part of this profession . " // HOOPSTERS AND pucksters agree that there is an art to napping  --  especially those who do n't nod off quite so easily as SI PLAYERS 's First Person subject Joe Johnson ( headshot above soda cans ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trick is to " cave it up . You want to get it as dark as possible as fast as possible . You get the drapes closed , bring tape from the rink to tape up the blinds , take a chair and push it up against the blinds to seal it , put your bags along the bottom of the window to make sure no light comes in . " ( Mair also avoids soda because caffeine interferes with his nap . ) ... Presnooze labor sometimes needs to be divided . Says Los Angeles 's Miller , " When you have a roommate there are ground rules . Someone is in charge of the remote control . Someone is in charge of the drapes . Someone is in charge of the wake-up call . The longer you 're with the guy , the easier it gets . " Flyers defenseman Derian Hatcher ( below ) , a proponent of " mandatory naps " who sleeps between 2:00 and 4:00 on game days , says that " on the road finding the right pillow is tough . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like hard pillows , and I do n't like the kind that sink all around you when you bury your head in them . " Golden State 's Richardson ( below , number 23 ) is one of the few players who naps longer on the road ( " I get like four or five hours , " he says ) than at home ( about three hours ) . // HOW DO you get to sleep quickly in broad daylight ? It helps , says Trail Blazers forward Raef LaFrentz , to have a routine . " I eat a quick second breakfast or lunch , watch a little TV , read the newspaper and lie down for an hour and a half at 1:30 . " Minnesota Wild defenseman Brent Burns buys DVDs of Beverly Hills 90210 to put himself to sleep . L.A. Kings forward Mike Cammalleri surfs the channels for golf . " I just fall asleep . I watch it , watch it , watch it and , then , in my mind , I 'm putting somewhere . " Bobcats forward Sean May 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been sleeping with since he got it from his mother , Debbie , as a child . May ( above , on couch ) is also precise in schedule . " You 're trying to be out between one and three , " he says . " If you sleep too much or too late , you 'll act tired during the game . On the mornings of game days I 'll make myself get up at eight or nine , force myself up so that I 'm ready for a nap when it 's time . " // THE GREATEST obstacle to napping , of course , is noise . A snoring roommate is the most common source . Hatcher has some less-than-fond memories of former Stars teammate Shawn Chambers , who " never stopped snoring , " except , presumably , when he was awake . " I threw pillows at him , " says Hatcher . " Or I 'd yell at him while hitting him with a pillow . " ... Another of the NHL 's star snorers is Wild enforcer Derek Boogaard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have to get to bed before he does because once he tries to go to sleep , he 's asleep in two minutes and snoring in three . It 's like lying next to a train station . " Sighs Boogaard ( above , head shot ) , who has been in six of Minnesota 's seven fights this season , " That 's what four or five broken noses will do . " ... Defenseman Kurtis Foster understands . " You do n't want a roommate who snores , " says Foster , " and I 'm that person . I 've woken up to pillows over the head , to a remote control being thrown at me . I 've woken up to guys opening the drawer and closing it as hard as they can , almost like a shotgun sound . " // BUT EVEN worse than snoring is the phone calls some players get in their hotel rooms from fans of opposing teams determined to wreak havoc on their naps . " When I played for the Rangers , " says Kings goalie Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islanders in 1998 . Every time we went to Long Island after that , during the pregame sleep at the hotel I 'd get death threats on the phone . " ... Sabres goalie Martin Biron says French-Canadian players visiting in Montreal are particularly vulnerable to unwanted wake-up calls  --  " Everybody knows you 're there and knows your name . " ... Minnesota forward Mark Parrish recalls an afternoon nap when " my phone rang and I woke up like it was a fire alarm . I did n't know what was going on . It was a fan wanting to screw up our routine . The worst is when you wake up and you think you 're late . You shoot out of bed , your heart 's racing , you start throwing your shoes on , thinking you 're late for the bus . And you look at the clock and it 's only 2:45 . It takes awhile to settle back down . " ... For all the challenges to successful napping , however , Biron says that once you get the knack , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap and learn how to do it good . Then when the season ends , you 'll have a two-week period where , from 1:30 until four every afternoon , you 'll hit a wall because your body is so used to taking a nap . "
