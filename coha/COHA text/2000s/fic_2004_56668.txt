preBOOK OF THE THREE DRAGONS , BY KENNETH MORRIS ( 1930 ) THE sourcebook of Welsh myth is the Mabinogion , a mass of Celtic fragments whose unpolished state fascinates authors . Evangeline Walton retold the stories ; Lloyd Alexander 's " Prydain " echoes them ; Alan Garner brillantly transmuted one episode as The Owl Service . <p> All these wrote in modern idiom . But Kenneth Moms embellished the tattered myths like a true Welsh bard , shaping an overarching Story whose characters always seem a little drunk with their own magniloquence . <p> Following the earlier The Fates of the Princes of Dyfed ( 1914 ) , Book of the Three Dragons recaps the history of Prince Pwyll from the Mabinogion 's first section or " branch , " links to the second-branch legend of the Wonderful ( disembodied ) Head of Bran the Blessed , and boldly reincarnates Pwyll  --  now tested to destruction by Welsh gods  --  as third-branch hero Manawyddan . <p> Manawyddan 's much-changed story has the new goal of recovering stolen treasures of Britain 's Three Primitive Bards , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mabinogion asides about earning a living by craftsmanship become an elaborately witty trio of apprenticeships as Manawyddan learns " Subtle Shoemaking , of the Esoteric Craft " ... then shieldmaking , then swordmaking . Swords that " would think little of shaving the beard from the gnat in mid air . " <p> Thus schooled , he tackles such silver-tongued villains as Gwiawn Llygad Cath the Sea-Thief ( " Whether that be the famous breastplate or no , it would be imprudent to leave it unstolen. " )  --  a pursuit which leads to the harrowing of a very Welsh hell . <p> Morris writes with all Lord Dunsany 's richness , though his cadences are Celtic rather than biblical . This one should be read aloud . <p> <p> By David Langford <p>
