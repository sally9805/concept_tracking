It 's a bird ! It 's a plane ! No , it 's Superman Returns , the new installment of the man of steel 's big-screen story , out this week . Does he still stand for truth , justice and box-office brawn ? At 50 , SUPERMAN was soaring high <P> It was a heroic scenario : the explosion of the doomed planet Krypton , the miraculous escape of the infant son of a Kryptonian scientist , the discovery of the baby 's spaceship by an elderly couple near the Midwestern town of Smallville . And the gradual revelations of the child 's superhuman strength , the foster parents ' exhortation that he " must use it to assist humanity , " the youth 's adoption of a dual identity  --  the mild-mannered , blue-suited newspaper reporter , Clark Kent , and the red-caped , blue-haired Superman , the man of steel ... He is a figure who somehow manages to embody the best qualities in that nebulous thing known as the American character . He is honest , he tells the truth , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only is he good , he is also innocent , in a kind and guileless way that Americans have sometimes been but more often have only imagined themselves to be .
