She stood in Purgatory and studied death . The blood and the gore of it , the ferocity of its glee . It had come to this place with the willful temper of a child , full of heat and passion and careless brutality . Murder was rarely a tidy business . Whether it was craftily calculated or wildly impulsive , it tended to leave a mess for others to clean up . It was her job to wade through the debris of murder , to pick up the pieces , see where they fit , and put together a picture of the life that had been stolen . And through that picture to find the image of a killer . Now , in the early hours of morning , in the hesitant spring of 2059 , her boots crunched over a jagged sea of broken glass . Her eyes , brown and cool , scanned the scene : shattered mirrors , broken bottles , splintered wood . Wall screens were smashed , privacy booths scarred and dented . Pricey leather and cloth that had covered stools or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What had once been an upscale strip club was now a jumbled pile of expensive garbage . What had once been a man lay behind the wide curve of the bar . Now a victim , sprawled in his own blood . Lieutenant Eve Dallas crouched beside him . She was a cop , and that made him hers . " Male . Black . Late thirties . Massive trauma , head and body . Multiple broken bones . " She took a gauge from her field kit to take the body and ambient temperatures . " Looks like the fractured skull would have done the job , but it did n't stop there . " " He was beaten to pieces . " Eve acknowledged her aide 's comment with a grunt . She was looking at what was left of a well-built man in his prime , a good six-two and two hundred and thirty pounds of what had been toned muscle . " What do you see , Peabody ? " Automatically , Peabody shifted her stance , focused her vision . " The victim ... well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first blow probably took him down , or at least dazed him . The killer followed through , with repeated strikes . From the pattern of the blood splatter , and brain matter , he was taken out with head shots , then beaten while down , likely unconscious . Some of the injuries were certainly delivered postmortem . The metal bat is the probable murder weapon and was used by someone of considerable strength , possibly chemically induced , as the scene indicates excessive violence often demonstrated by users of Zeus . " " Time of death , oh four hundred , " Eve stated , then turned her head to look up at Peabody . Her aide was starched and pressed and as official as they came , with her uniform cap set precisely on her dark chin-length hair . She had good eyes , Eve thought , clear and dark . And though the sheer vileness of the scene had leached some of the color from her cheeks , she was holding . " Motive ? " Eve asked . " It appears to be robbery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer 's open and empty . The credit machine 's broken . " " Mmm-hmm . Snazzy place like this would be heavier in credits , but they 'd do some cash business . " " Zeus addicts kill for spare change . " " True enough . But what would our victim have been doing alone , in a closed club , with an addict ? Why would he let anyone hopped on Zeus behind the bar ? And ... " With her sealed fingers she picked up a small silver credit chip from the river of blood . " Why would our addict leave these behind ? A number of them are scattered here around the body . " " He could have dropped them . " But Peabody began to think she was n't seeing something Eve did . " Could have . " She counted the coins as she picked them up , thirty in all , sealed them in an evidence bag , and handed it to Peabody . Then she picked up the bat . It was fouled with blood and brain . About two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean business . Mean business . " It 's good , solid metal , not something an addict would pick up in some abandoned building . We 're going to find this belonged here , behind the bar . We 're going to find , Peabody , that our victim knew his killer . Maybe they were having an after-hours drink . " Her eyes narrowed as she pictured it . " Maybe they had words , and the words escalated . More likely , our killer already had an edge on . He knew where the bat was . Came behind the bar . Something he 'd done before , so our friend here does n't think anything of it . He 's not concerned , does n't worry about turning his back . " She did so herself , measuring the position of the body , of the splatter . " The first blow rams him face first into the glass on the back wall . Look at the cuts on his face . Those are n't nicks from flying glass . They 're too long , too deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killer takes the next swing here , across the jaw . That spins him around again . He grabs the shelves there , brings them down . Bottles crashing . That 's when he took the killing blow . This one that cracked his skull like an egg . " She crouched again , sat back on her heels . " After that , the killer just beat the hell out of him , then wrecked the place . Maybe in temper , maybe as cover . But he had enough control to come back here , to look at his handiwork before he left . He dropped the bat here when he was done . " " He wanted it to look like a robbery ? Like an illegals overkill ? " " Yeah . Or our victim was a moron and I 'm giving him too much credit . You got the body and immediate scene recorded ? All angles ? " " Yes , sir . " " Let 's turn him over . " The shattered bones shifted like a sack of broken crockery as Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamn it . " She reached down to lift the smeared ID from the cool , congealing pool of blood . With her sealed thumb , she wiped at the photo and the shield . " He was on the job . " " He was a cop ? " Peabody stepped forward . She heard the sudden silence . The crime scene team and the sweepers working on the other side of the bar stopped talking . Stopped moving . A half dozen faces turned . Waited . " Kohli , Detective Taj . " Eve 's face was grim as she got to her feet . " He was one of us . " Peabody crossed the littered floor to where Eve stood watching the remains of Detective Taj Kohli being bagged for transferal to the morgue . " I got his basics , Dallas . He 's out of the One twenty-eight , assigned to Illegals . Been on the job for eight years . Came out of the military . He was thirty-seven . Married . Two kids . " " Anything pop on his record ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Let 's find out if he was working undercover here or just moonlighting . Elliott ? I want those security discs . " " There are n't any . " One of the crime scene team hurried over . His face was folded into angry lines . " Cleaned out . Every one of them . The place had full scope , and this son of a bitch snagged every one . We got nothing . " " Covered his tracks . " With her hands on her hips , Eve turned a circle . The club was triple-leveled , with a stage on the main , dance floors on one and two . Privacy rooms ringed the top . For full scope , she estimated it would need a dozen cameras , probably more . To snag all the record discs would have taken time and care . " He knew the place , " she decided . " Or he 's a fucking security whiz . Window dressing , " she muttered . " All this destruction 's just window dressing . He knew what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who owns the place , who runs it . I want to know everybody who works here . I want to know the setup . " " Lieutenant ? " A harassed-looking sweeper trudged through the chaos . " There 's a civilian outside . " " There are a lot of civilians outside . Let 's keep them there . " " Yes , sir , but this one insists on speaking to you . He says this is his place . And , ah ... " " And , ah ' what ? " " And that you 're his wife . " " Roarke Entertainment , " Peabody announced as she read off the data from her palm PC . She sent Eve a cautious smile .. " Guess who owns Purgatory ? " " I should 've figured it . " Resigned , Eve strode to the entrance door . He looked very much as he 'd looked two hours before when they 'd parted ways to go about their individual business . Sleek and gorgeous . The light topcoat he wore over his dark suit fluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugged at the mane of black hair that framed his poetically sinful face . The dark glasses he wore against the glare of the sun only added to the look of slick elegance . And when he slipped them off as she stepped out , the brilliant blue of his eyes met hers . He tucked the glasses in his pocket , lifted an eyebrow . " Good morning , Lieutenant . " " I had a bad feeling when I walked in here . It 's just your kind of place , is n't it ? Why do you have to own every damn thing ? " " It was a boyhood dream . " His voice cruised over Ireland , picked up the music of it . He glanced past her to the police seal . " It appears we 've both been inconvenienced . " " Did you have to tell the sweeper I was your wife ? " " You are my wife , " he said easily and shifted his gaze back to her face . " A fact which pleases me daily . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring before she could tug it free again . " No touching , " she hissed at him , which made him smile . " That 's not what you said a few hours ago . In fact " " Shut up , Roarke . " She glanced around , though none of the cops working the scene was outside or close enough to hear . " This is a police investigation . " " So I 'm told . " " And who told you ? " " The head of the maintenance team who found the body . He did call the police first ; ' he pointed out . " But it 's natural he 'd report the incident to me . What happened ? " There was no point in griping because his business had tangled around hers . Again . She tried to console herself that he could and would help her cut through some of the muck of paperwork . " Do you have a bartender by the name of Kohli ? Taj Kohli ? " " I have no idea . But I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his breast pocket , keyed in a request for data . " Is he dead ? " " As dead gets . " " Yes , he was mine , " Roarke confirmed , and the Irish in his voice had taken on a cold note . " For the past three months . Part time . Four nights a week . He had a family . " " Yes , I know . " Such things mattered to him , and it always touched her heart . " He was a cop , " Eve said . This time his brows lifted . " Did n't have that data in your little scan , did you ? " " No . It seems my personnel director was careless . That will be fixed . Am I allowed inside ? " " Yeah , in a minute . How long have you owned the place ? " " Four years , more or less . " " How many employees , full- and part-time ? " " I 'll get you all the data , Lieutenant , and answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he reached for the door himself . " But now , I 'd like to see my place . " He pushed inside , scanned the destruction , then focused in on the thick black bag being loaded on what the death attendants called a stroller . " How was he killed ? " " Thoroughly , " Eve said , then sighed when Roarke simply turned and stared at her . " It was ugly , okay ? Metal bat . " She watched Roarke look toward the bar and the spray of blood sparkling on glass like an incomprehensible painting . " After the first few hits , he would n't have felt anything . " " Ever had a bat laid into you ? I have , " he said before she could answer . " It 's not pleasant . It seems far-fetched to think it 's robbery , even one that got well out of hand . " " Why ? " " There 'd have been enough prime liquor , easily fenced , to keep anyone cozily fixed for some time . Why break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a place like this , it 's not for the bit of cash that might be copped , but for the inventory and perhaps some of the equipment . " " Is that the voice of experience ? " She teased a grin out of him . " Naturally . My experience , that is , as a property owner and a law-abiding citizen . " " Right . " " Security discs ? " " Gone . He got all of them . " " Then it follows he 'd cased the place carefully beforehand . " " How many cameras ? " Once again , Roarke took out his pad , checked data . " Eighteen . Nine on this floor , six on two , and the other two on the top level for full scope . Before you ask , closing is at three , which would have staff out by half past . The last show , and we 've live ones here , ends at two . The musicians and the entertainers " " Strippers . " " As you like , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll have names and schedules for you within the hour . " " Appreciate it . Why Purgatory ? " " The name ? " The ghost of a smile flirted with his mouth . " I liked it . The priests will tell you Purgatory 's a place for atonement , rehabilitation perhaps . A bit like prison . I 've always seen it as a last chance to be human " he decided . " Before you strap on your wings and halo or face the fire . " " Which would you rather ? " she wondered . " The wings or the fire ? " " That 's the point , you see . I prefer being human . " As the stroller wheeled by , he ran a hand over her short brown hair . " I 'm sorry for this . " " So am I. Any reason a New York City detective would have been working undercover in Purgatory ? " " I could n't say . It 's certainly likely that some of the clientele might dabble in areas not strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed of anything overt . Some illegals might change hands in privacy rooms or under tables , but there 's been no large transactions here . I would have known . The strippers do n't turn tricks unless they 're licensed , which some are . No one under age is allowed through the doorsas client or staff . I have my own standards , Lieutenant , such as they are . " " I 'm not coming down on you . I need a picture . " " You 're pissed that I 'm here at all . " She waited a minute , her short , choppy hair disordered from its dance outside in the early breeze . As the morgue techs opened the door to transfer Kohli , the sounds of the day punched into the club . Traffic was already thickening . Cars crammed irritably on the street , air commuters swarmed the skies . She heard the call of an early-bird glide-cart operator call to the techs and ask : " What da fuck ' ? " " Okay , I 'm pissed that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When 's the last time you were in here ? " " Months . It ran well and did n't need my direct attention . " " Who manages it for you ? " " Rue MacLean . I 'll get her information to you as well . " " Sooner than later . Do you want to go through the place now ? " " No point in it until I 've refreshed myself on how it was . I 'll want to be let back in once I 've done that . " " I 'll take care of it . Yes , Peabody ' ? " she said , turning as her aide inched forward and cleared her throat . " Sorry , sir , but I thought you 'd want to know I reached the victim 's squad captain . They 're sending a member of his unit and a counselor to inform next of kin . They need to know if they should wait for you or see the wife alone . " " Tell them to wait . We 'll head over now and meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Roarke . " I do n't envy you your job , Lieutenant . " Because he needed it , he took her hand , linked their fingers firmly . " But I 'll let you get back to it . I 'll have the information you wanted to you as soon as I can . " " Roarke ? " she called as he started for the door . " I 'm sorry about your place . " " Wood and glass . There 's plenty more , " he replied as he looked at her over his shoulder . " He does n't mean it " Eve murmured when he 'd shut the door behind him . " Sir ? " " They messed with him . He wo n't let it go " Eve heaved out a breath . " Come on , Peabody , let 's go see the wife and get this particular hell over with . " The Kohlis lived in a decent , midlevel building on the East Side . The kind of place , Eve mused , where you found young families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , not cheap enough for the struggling . It was a simple multiunit , pleasantly if not elegantly rehabbed post-Urban Wars . Door security was a basic code entry . Eve spotted the cops before she 'd double-parked and flipped her On Duty light to active . The woman was well turned out , with gilt-edged hair that curved up to her cheeks in two stiletto points . She wore sun shades and an inexpensive business suit in navy . The shoes with their thin , two-inch heels told Eve she worked a desk . Brass . Eve was sure of it . The man had good shoulders and a bit of pudge at the middle . He 'd let his hair go gray , and there was a lot of it . Currently , it was dancing in the breeze around his quiet , composed face . He wore cop shoeshard-soled and buffed to a gleam . His suit jacket was a little small in the body and starting to fray at the cuffs . A long-timer , Eve judged , who 'd moved from beat to street to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward but did n't offer her hand for a polite shake . " I recognized you . You get a lot of play in the media . " It was n't said with rebuke , but there was a hint of it in the air , nonetheless . " I 'm Captain Roth , from the One twenty-eight . This is Sergeant Clooney out of my house . He 's here as grief counselor . " " Thanks for waiting . Officer Peabody , my aide . " " What is the status of your investigation , Lieutenant ? " " Detective Kohli 's body is with the ME and will have priority . My report will be written and filed subsequent to notification of next of kin . " She paused to avoid shouting over the sudden blast of a maxibus that pulled to the curb half a block down . " At this point , Captain Roth , I have a dead police officer who was the apparent victim of a particularly brutal beating in the early hours of this morning while he was in a club , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part-time bartender . " " Robbery ? " " Unlikely . " " Then what is the motive , in your opinion ? " A little seed of resentment planted itself in Eve 's gut . It would , she knew , fester there if she was n't careful . " I 've formed no opinion as to motive at this stage of my investigation . Captain Roth , do you want to stand on the street and question me , or would you prefer to read my report when it 's filed ? " Roth opened her mouth , then sucked in a breath . " Point taken , Lieutenant . Detective Kohli worked under me for five years . I 'll be straight with you . I want this investigation handled out of my house . " " I appreciate your feelings in this matter , Captain Roth . I can only assure you that as long as I 'm primary , the investigation into the death of Detective Kohli will receive my complete focus . " Take off the damn shades , Eve thought . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority , " Eve continued . " But I 'll be straight with you . I wo n't give it up easy . I stood over him this morning . I saw what was done to him . You could n't want his killer any more than I do . " " Captain . " Clooney stepped forward , laying a hand lightly on Roth 's arm at the elbow . There were lines fanning out from his pale blue eyes . They made him look tired and somehow trustworthy . " Lieutenant . Emotions are running pretty high right now . For all of us . But we 've got a job to do here and now . " He glanced up , homing in on a window four stories above . " Whatever we 're feeling does n't come close to what 's going to be felt upstairs . " " You 're right . You 're right , Art . Let 's get this done . " Roth turned to the entrance , bypassed the code with her master . " Lieutenant ? " Clooney hung back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Taj 's wife . I have to ask if you could go a little easy just now . I know what she 's about to go through . I lost a son in the line of duty a few months back . It rips a hole in you . " " I 'm not going to kick her while she 's down , Clooney . " Eve shoved through the doors , caught herself , turned back . " I did n't know him , " she said more calmly , " but he was murdered , and he was a cop . That 's enough for me . Okay ? " " Yeah . Yeah , okay . " " Christ , I hate this . " She followed Roth to the elevator . " How do you do it ? " she asked Clooney . " The counseling thing . How do you stand it ? " " To tell you the truth , they tapped me for it because I have a way with keeping the peace . Mediation " he added with a quick smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a try , and found I could do some good . You know what they feelevery stage of it . " He pressed his lips together as they stepped onto the elevator . The smile was long gone . " You stand it because maybe you can help ... just a little . It makes a difference if the counselor 's a cop . And I 've discovered in the last few months it makes a bigger one if the counselor 's a cop who experienced a loss . You ever lose a family member , Lieutenant ? " Eve flashed on a dingy room , the bloody husk of a man , and the child she 'd been , huddled broken in a corner . " I do n't have any family . " " Well ... " was all Clooney said as they stepped off on the fourth floor . She would know , and they were all aware of it . A cop 's spouse would know the minute she opened the door . How the words were spoken varied little , and it did n't matter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrevocably changed . They did n't have the chance to knock before it began . Patsy Kohli was a pretty woman with smooth , ebony skin and a closely cropped thatch of black curls . She was dressed to go out , a baby sling strapped across her breasts . The small boy at her side had his hand clasped in hers as he danced frantically in place . " Let 's go swing ! Let 's go swing ! " But his mother had frozen in place , the laughter that had been in her eyes dying away . She lifted one hand , pressing it to the baby , and the baby to her heart . " Taj . " Roth had taken off her sunshades . Her eyes were coldly blue , rigidly blank . " Patsy . We need to come in . " " Taj . " Patsy stood where she was , slowly shaking her head . " Taj . " " Here now , Patsy . " Clooney moved in , sliding an arm around her shoulders . " Why do n't we sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The little boy began to cry , wailing yelps as he tugged on his mother 's unresponsive hand . Both Roth and Eve looked down at him with stares of sheer , hot panic . Peabody eased inside , crouched down to his level . " Hi , pal . " " Going swing , " he said pitifully , while great tears spilled down his chubby cheeks . " Yeah . Lieutenant , why do n't I take the boy out ? " " Good idea . Good thinking " Her stomach was busily tying itself into knots at the rising sobs . " Mrs. Kohli , with your permission , my officer will take your son outside for awhile . I think that would be best " " Chad " Patsy stared down as if coming out of a dream . " We 're going to the park . Two blocks over . The swings " " I 'll take him , Mrs. Kohli . We 'll be fine . " With an ease that had Eve frowning , Peabody lifted the boy , set him on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ? " " Patsy , why do n't you give me your little girl there . " Gently , Clooney unhooked the sling , slipped the baby free . Then , to Eve 's shock , he passed the bundle to her . " Oh listen , I ca n't " But Clooney was already guiding Pasty to the sofa , and Eve was left holding the bag . Or so she thought of it . Wincing , she looked down , and when big , black eyes stared curiously up at her , her palms went damp . And when the baby said , " Coo " she lost all the spit in her mouth . She searched the room for help . Clooney and Roth were already flanking Pasty , and Clooney 's voice was a quiet murmur . The room was small and lived-in , with a scatter of toys on the rug and a scentone she did n't recognizethat was talc and crayons and sugar . The scent of children . But she spotted a basket of neatly folded laundry on the floor by a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman handling a homemade boomer , laid the baby on top . " Stay " she whispered , awkwardly patting the dark , downy head . And started to breathe again . She tuned back into the room , saw the woman on the sofa gathered into herself , rocking , rocking , with her hands gripped in Clooney 's . She made no sound , and her tears fell like rain . Eve stayed out of the way , watched Clooney work , watched the unity of support stand on either side of the widow . This , she thought , was family . For what it was worth . And in times like this , it was all there could be . Grief settled into the room like fog . It would , she knew , be a long time before it burned away again . " It 's my fault . It 's my fault . " They were the first words Patsy spoke since she 'd sat on the sofa . " No . " Clooney squeezed her hands until she lifted her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To believe you , to take comfort , they needed to see it all in your eyes . " Of course it 's not . " " He 'd never have been working there if not for me . I did n't want to go back to work after Jilly was born . I wanted to stay home . The money , the professional mother 's salary was so much less than " " Patsy , Taj was happy you were content to stay home with the children . He was so proud of them and of you . " " I can't -- -Chad : ' She pulled her hands free , pressed them to her face . " How can I tell him ? How can we live without Taj ? Where is he ? " She dropped her hands , looked around blindly . " I have to go see him . Maybe there 's a mistake . " It was , Eve knew , her time . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Kohli , there 's no mistake . I 'm Lieutenant Dallas . I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Patsy got shakily to her feet . " Yes . I 'm sorry , very sorry for your loss . Can you talk to me , Mrs. Kohli ? Help me find the person who did this ? " " Lieutenant Dallas , " Roth began , but Patsy shook her head . " No , no . I want to talk . Taj would want me to . He 'd want ... Where 's Jilly ? Where 's my baby ? " " I , ah ... " Feeling sticky again , Eve gestured to the hamper . " Oh " Patsy wiped tears from her face , smiled . " She 's so good . Such a love . She hardly ever cries . I should put her in her crib . " " I 'll do that for you , Patsy . " Clooney rose . " You talk to the lieutenant . " He gave Eve a quiet look , full of sorrow and understanding . " That 's what Taj would want . Do you want us to call someone for you ? Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath . " Yes , please . If you 'd call Carla for me . " " Captain Roth will do that for you , wo n't you , Captain ? While I put the baby down . " Roth struggled , set her teeth . It did n't surprise Eve to see the annoyance . Clooney had essentially taken over , gently , And this was n't a woman who liked taking orders from her sergeant . " Yes , of course . " With a final warning look at Eve , she walked into the next room . " Are you with Taj 's squad ? " " No , I 'm not . " " No , no , of course . " Patsy rubbed her temple . " You 'd be with Homicide . " She started to break , the sound coming through her lips like a whimper . And Eve watched with admiration as she toughened up . " What do you want to know ? " " Your husband did n't come home this morning . You were n't concerned ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the arm of the couch , and lowered herself down . " He 'd told me he 'd probably go into the station from the club . He sometimes did that . And he said he was meeting someone after closing . " " Who ? " " He did n't say , just that he had someone to see after closing . " " Do you know of anyone who wished him harm , Mrs. Kohli ? " " He was a cop , " she said simply . " Do you know anyone who wishes you harm , Lieutenant ? " Fair enough , Eve thought and nodded . " Anyone specific ? Someone he mentioned to you . " " No . Taj did n't bring work home . It was a point of honor for him , I think . He did n't want anything to touch his family . I do n't even know what cases he was working on . He did n't like to talk about it . But he was worried . " She folded her hands tightly in her lap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gold band on her finger . " I could tell he was worried about something . I asked him about it , but he brushed it off . That was Taj , " she managed with a trembling smile . " He had , well some people would say it was a male dominant thing , but it was just Taj . He was old-fashioned about some things . He was a good man . A wonderful father . He loved his job . " She pressed her lips together . " He would have been proud to die in the line of duty . But not like this . Not like this . Whoever did this to him took that away from him . Took him away from me and from his babies . How can that be ? Lieutenant , how can that be ? " And as there was no answer to it ; all Eve could do was ask more questions .
