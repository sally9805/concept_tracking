Drive Lamborghini 's latest fantasy car , the Murcilago roadster , and you 'd be wise to leave the roof at home . For starters , you 'll want to be seen in a vehicle that looks like a Cubist sculpture : a cross between a B-2 Stealth bomber and the Batmobile . And you do n't want to be seen wrestling with the roof , since it 's little more than an erector set with a fabric tarp and may require an engineering degree to dismantle . If you hit 100 m.p.h. , Lamborghini warns , the roof might blow off  --  and how embarrassing would that be , losing your top in a $320,000 car ? <P> Lamborghini may be owned by Volkswagen AG , but do n't let the fact that Germans hold the purse strings fool you : the Italians are still making blissfully impractical transport . Since 1998 , VW has pumped $155 million into the brand , with Lambo currently producing two models ( the Gallardo is the other ) for the first time in its 41-year history . One feature the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll bars that pop up within milliseconds in a rollover . But the Murcilago , named for a legendary Spanish bull so fierce it was spared by a matador , is as outrageous as Lambo 's prior exotica , cars like the Countach and Diablo . <P> You want doors that open vertically , like a pair of steel scissors ? Check . A 580-h.p. , 6.2-liter V-12 engine ? Yup . A spoiler that pops up when you reach 85 m.p.h. , for aerodynamic stability ? You got it . Lambo designed the cockpit to be asymmetrical , orienting it toward the driver with touches like perforated leather upholstery on the left side and a smooth finish on the passenger side . The interior is race-car minimalist , with metallic trim and analog dials . <P> The Murcilago shoots from 0 to 60 in 3.8 sec. and has a top speed of 200 m.p.h . I 'll take Lambo 's word for it . Unless you 're on a closed course or have a death wish , it 's tough to push it to the max . On New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth gear to feel like a human cannonball and pull all the Le Mans moves I could safely muster . With four-wheel drive and Pirelli 18-in. tires , the car never felt unstable . But here 's the rub : it takes every ounce of restraint not to break the speed limit in this bull , yet the sound of the engine behind you is so overwhelming you may not notice the state trooper until he 's on your tail . Your only hope : that he 's content to hover and snap pictures with his cell-phone camera with the rest of the traffic . <P> Lambo plans to make about 200 Murcilago roadsters annually and will customize the interior , dyeing the leather fuchsia , for instance , should that be your desire . Radar detector is sold separately .
