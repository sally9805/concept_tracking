SHOW OF THE YEAR 1 The Sopranos ( HBO ) Sopranos creator David Chase spent the first season of his dysfunctional Mob-family series designing a finely detailed world ; he spent the second season raising it to operatic grandness and exaggeration ( remember the talking-fish season ender ? ) ; and he spent the past season bringing it back down to earth . The first two seasons brought him raves and TV-industry power ; in the third he used those rewards to do his best to subvert what he had created . Chase knew that James Gandolfini 's Jersey crime boss Tony Soprano had become , to too many viewers , a huggy bear . ( How cutehe 's henpecked ! How conflicted-he kills people , but he so loves his wife and kids ! ) * And this year , Chase exploded The Sopranos . He allowed the therapist , . Lorraine Bracco 's Dr. Melfi , to be raped , and then defied our TV-ingrained expectation that she would be revenged . And he had the faithless Tony finally snag a girlfriend ( Annabella Sciorra ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Chase , who knows commercial TV from years on The Rockford Files and Northern Exposure , denied us the comforts of television 's conventions . In doing so , he advanced his medium 's art once again . 2 BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER ( UPN ) In a calendar year 's worth of emotional episodes that saw the death of Buffy 's mother , the death and resurrection of Buffy herself , and a musical production that put most contemporary Broadway efforts to shame , the Slayer 's fiercest battle continues to be against that old TV shibboleth , Industry Respect . No matter ; wise , stern creator Joss Whedon still forces us to go where we may not want to venture , but are ultimately always glad we did : Alyson Hannigan 's Willow gone witchcraft-crazy ; James Marsters ' Spike gone soft for Buffy ; Nicholas Brendon 's Xander and Emma Caulfield 's Anya picking out wedding china patterns . Oh , the horror , the exquisite horror ! 3 THE BERNIE MAC SHOW ( FOX ) Self-proclaimed " strong , healthy black man " Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In starting nearly every episode by revitalizing a trite claim-that " we 're all family " - Mac taps into the feelings Bill Cosby did 15 years before ( that family transcends race ; that race determines social perceptions ; that all kids need to be firmly disciplined ) . Yet Mac also takes preCosby , old-school TV strategies-staring directly into the camera and talking like George Burns ; doing long slow-burns like Jack Benny-and adds heartfelt funk. 4 THE SIMPSONS ( FOX ) With each year , the consensus builds that this is one of the greatest sustained-quality acts on television . True but it reQuires a grunt-work TV critic to keep track and point out that this was a slightly uneven season ( witness the aimless Thanksgiving episode : That joke about Bart digging a hole to China-as if plotting an escape-went nowhere , did n't it ? ) . But regular broadcasts of brilliance like the one featuring Lisa 's ecologically minded decision to live in an imperiled redwood tree ( which incorporated everything from slapstick humor to pointed political satire ) are what keep this the only show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising adroitness. 5 BOYCOTT HBO ) The year 's most disgracefully underrated TV movie was this startlingly fresh , swift biopic about Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . ' s 1955 Montgomery , Ala. , bus boycotts . ( Ignored at the Emmys , Boycott was recently nominated for several NAACP Image Awards . ) In the lead role , Jeffrey Wright proved fearless in making King a brazen , brainy man with no tolerance for passive piety . Director Clark Johnson ( former cast member of NBC 's Homicide : Life on the Street ) staged and shot King 's political protests and private Photograph // <p>
