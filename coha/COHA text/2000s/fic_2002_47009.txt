David Prill 's three novels , Serial Killer Days , The Unnatural , and Second Coming Attractions , have earned him favorable comparisons to Howard Waldrop and R. A. Lafferty for his odd blend of surrealism , humor , and Americana ( a blend you 'll certainly find in evidence here ) . He is a native Minnesotan who lives in the Twin Cities vicinity with his wife Lily and their dog Nicky . His infrequent forays into the realm of short fiction are due to be published soon in a limited edition from Subterranean Press . His first F &SF; story is a foray into a realm that 's frequented often  --  Morpheus 's realm-but rarely with such sweet , good-natured humor . <p> HEY , JERRY , THERE 'S THAT new girl . Oh , yes . Her name 's Caroline May Ames . She 's a swell kid . Why ? Do you know her ? Not very well , Bud . I wish I did . I do n't know what it is , but there 's something about her you like . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all look nice , at first ... Jerry had n't had a date in an eternity . He did n't know why . They had dressed him so stylishly . His black dress shoes had such a sheen to them . His wispy brown hair was trimmed and combed . His cheeks had a ruddy , outdoorsy hue . His fingernails had once been nicely manicured - now they had grown long . Too long . Maybe that was it . Maybe his uncut fingernails were turning off the girls . No , it had to be more than that . All in all , I look pretty sharp , he thought . Then maybe it 's my personality or personal habits . I 'm soft-spoken - my breath would hardly fog a mirror . Polite . To a fault . Interesting experiences to share . Absolutely . My life review was a gripping melodrama . Jerry did n't want to face rejection again , but he did like that new girl , Caroline May Ames . They had exchanged small talk once before , the day she arrived . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so pretty . Her white dress had ivory beads and lace . Her blonde hair cascaded comfortably over her shoulders . She had such a peaceful look on her face . He called for her . Hi , Caroline . This is Jerry . Oh hi , Jerry . I was wondering , Caroline , if you want to go out with me tonight ? Tonight ? I 'm sorry , I ca n't , Jerry . I already have a date for tonight . Why do n't you call some other tithe ? Oh , okay . Thanks anyway , Caroline . Bye . Goodbye , Jerry . Strike out , Jerry thought , feeling dejected . Did n't she like him ? She acted like she did . Then why did n't she want to go out with him ? He decided to ask Bud about it . Bud had been around longer than Jerry , and always seemed to have good advice to share . ... so I do n't know what happened . I asked Caroline for a date , and she turned me down flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A minute or so . That 's good . Your call should n't go on for hours . That 's a pretty sensible attitude . When did you ask her to go out with you ? Tonight . There 's your problem . Be sure not to wait until the last minute to ask a girl for a date . It 's no compliment to any girl to call her so late that she thinks she 's the last resort . I never thought of that . Thanks a lot , Bud . Clad to help , fella . Jerry tried again the next day . Hi , Caroline , this is Jerzy . Hi , Jerry . Caroline , uh , I do n't suppose you 'd want to go out with me sometime , Oh , I suppose we could . Call me sometime . That was better . A real step in the right direction . He told Bud about his success . That 's great , Jerry . When are you two going out , then ? Uh , we did n't exactly set a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't ask a girl out in a backhanded way that makes her feel uncomfortable . It 's a mark of your insecurity , too . And one other tip : Do n't ask a girl if she is busy on a certain night . That puts her on the spot . Boy , this is more complicated than I thought , Jerry mused . So how should I ask her then ? Think of something to do that she might like . Do n't leave it entirely up to her . Suggest two or three activities , and see how she responds . Perhaps go out with a group of friends . There 's a skating party on Friday . Maybe Caroline would want to do that . Now you 've got the hang of it . He called for Caroline again . Hi , Jerry . Hi , Caroline . Say , the gang is going to a skating party on Friday . I was wondering if you 'd want to go with me . We 'd have to leave early , but we 'd get back by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh rot off our bones . We 'd get back later if we did that . Gee , Jerry , the skating party sounds like loads of fun . I 'd love to go . Great . I 'll come for you around six . Jerry was smart . He kept a date calendar , and checked it before asking Caroline to the party . Not a bad idea . Good boy ! Bud congratulated Jerry when told of his success with Caroline . I wish I could go to the skating party but I told my folks I 'd spend the evening with them . They do n't get out much anymore . I really appreciate your help , said Jerry . I just wish I could take you with me ! Jerry was joshing Bud , but it was true . His friend knew the proper habit patterns , and what it took to be popular . The days leading up to his date with Caroline seemed to crawl and creep . Throughout the week Jerry quizzed Bud on how he should behave on his date , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekend rolled in , and Jerry grew stiff with anticipation . Wardrobe . Jerry decided to wear what he had on . His dark suit . It made him look more mature . A few holes , hardly noticeable , some mild staining in the crotch area , but Caroline would understand . She was that kind of girl . A few minutes before six Jerry showed up where Caroline lived . He did n't need Bud to tell him the importance of promptness . He wanted to make a good impression on her folks , too . Her parents were side by side when he arrived . Good evening , Mr. and Mrs. Ames . I 'm Jerry Weathers , Caroline 's friend . Even though they were Midwestern stoic , Jerry felt at ease with her mom and dad . There was n't enough left of them to make trouble . Jerry , how nice to see you . Caroline . She looked wonderful . White dress . Beads . Blonde hair . Shoulders . A portrayal of peace on her face . Hi , Caroline . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice . She addressed her parents . We should be back from the skating party by eleven . There is no magic formula about when to come home from a date . The hour Jerry and Caroline would return was decided by where they were going on their date , whether tomorrow was a school day , how many dates she had had recently , and so forth . I 'll take good care of her , Mr. and Mrs. Ames , said Jerry . Good night . " Night , Mom and Dad . Do n't wait up for us . As they met up with the gang for the skating party , Jerry felt relaxed and sociable . It had helped knowing Caroline , even just a little , before they went on their first date . Jerry had been on blind dates before . Most of them were dumb and deaf , too , and then there was that headless girl . A midway  --  ride mishap , he had overheard during her interment . She was fun , but not really Jerry 's type . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entranced he was with Caroline . He felt light on his feet , Dead Astaire , his skate blades cutting into the dark sheet on the pond . They skated in a long loop , hand in hand . Caroline 's hand was colder than Hell . He tried warming it up with his own , but it did n't seem to help much . As they skated beneath the festering full moon , they seemed to get into a rhythm with each other , carried away with the dance . Jerry would release Caroline , just the tips of their fingers touching , then he would draw her back in , and they would spin around , laughing inside , and skate on down the ice . Caroline seemed to be enjoying herself a lot . She was a good kid . Jerry had been concentrating on Caroline so much that he was surprised when he looked away and saw that the whole gang was watching them waltz across the pond . We 're a big hit , he said , nodding to the onlookers . When Caroline realized they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blade catching a ridge on the ice . She lost her balance , and they fell in time , too . The gang rushed over . Are you guys all right ? I think so , said Jerry . Caroline , are you hurt ? I 'm fine . Just a little bump . We should probably sit and watch the others skate for a while . No , do n't stop , the gang said . You two were skating so beautifully . Yes , how long have you been skating together ? Well , actually this is our first date , Jerry explained . You 're kidding ! Wow . Talk about a perfect match . Caroline got a blushing expression on her face , although no blood filled her cheeks . It was pretty cold out there on the pond . I think we 'll catch our breaths , Jerry said , helping Caroline back up onto her feet . They skated carefully over to the edge of the pond , stepping through the snowbank to a concrete bench . A weather-worn angel watched over them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call up the advice Bud had passed on to him . What did he say to talk about ? A popular movie , friends they have in common , anything that is of mutual interest . Movies were out . He had n't seen one in ages . Friends ? She was new in his neighborhood . Anything they were both interested in . That was the solution , but what did they share other than their place of residence ? He did n't know . Say something .... Uh , Caroline .... Yes , Jerry ? That 's a lovely dress you 're wearing . Why , thank you . You look very nice , too . Do I really ? I mean , it 's my only suit .... It looks fine . And my skin . The flaking ... the bugs .... She took both of his hands in hers . Jerry , I like you . For yourself . I do n't care about the bugs . Forget about the bugs . You 'd have to be looking for them to see them . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I 'm having a fun time . I really am . Gosh , Caroline , you 're really a neat person . Silence , and then Jerry began to feel awkward . Think of something . Then it struck him . How could I have missed it ? The perfect topic for first date small talk . He knew Bud would be proud . I like the smell of ... dirt . Do you ? I did n't at first . But I think I 'm getting used to it . Me , too . I mean , I did n't like it at first either . But after a while , it kind of , you know , gets under your skin . Yes , I suppose it does . In the springtime , they bring flowers . I love flowers . Sometimes , you can smell the rain . I always liked rain . Rain makes the whole world fresh and new . Sometimes , there are leaks . I suppose so . They chatted for a while longer , swapping death stories - she and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he succumbing to an inoperable brain tumor - then returned to the pond . The skating party broke up as the moon went down . Things were going so well with Caroline that he did n't want to break the spell . Caroline 's mom and dad were inert when they got back . It was only a quarter to eleven . I had a swell time tonight , said Caroline . I 'm glad you enjoyed the skating , Jerry said . I 'm glad you were n't hurt when you fell on the ice . I was more surprised than anything . All those people staring at us . It was like a dream . They were having a good time together . But all good things , like life itself , must eventually come to an end . Thank you for our date , Jerry said . I had fun , too . I hope we can see each other again . So do I , Caroline said . Please call for me anytime . In many communities , a good night kiss is expected as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any number of things . A token of friendship , a simple way of saying thank you for the evening , a sign of affection . What it means depends on the two people and their definition of their relationship and themselves . Jerry took the safe route . When Caroline rose , he squeezed her hand and searched for a smile . The look on her face said she had a smile inside her . And the date was over . The next day , he told Bud about his evening with Caroline . Not in too much detail , because he did n't want to be one of those boys who does n't respect a girl 's privacy and reputation , and most importantly her personal feelings . Your advice really helped me a lot , he told Bud . Glad to be of service , guy . I 'm not sure what to do next . Should I wait a few days before calling her again ? I do n't feel like waiting . But I do n't want her to think I 'm too pushy either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the two people and their definition of their relationship and themselves . Gosh , I do n't know , Bud . It all sounds pretty complicated . It 's the easiest thing in the world . You could call her today just to thank her for going with you to the skating party . That 's a common courtesy . A girl would appreciate the gesture . Remember , though , to have a sensible attitude . Your call should n't go on for hours . Should I ask her out again when I call ? After your courtesy call , I would wait a couple of days . By then it will be mid-week , and it will still give her several days notice . Remember , though , not to call her so late that she thinks she 's the last resort . So Jerry did call Caroline later that day , and handled it just the way Bud suggested . Although he yearned to talk to Caroline for hours , he kept it short . She seemed to genuinely appreciate his thoughtfulness . Her receptive attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's Jerry . Hi , Jerry . How are you ? I 'm doing very well , thank you . And yourself ? Just fine , thanks . I was wondering , Caroline , if you would like to go on a hay ride this Saturday ? The whole gang is going . Oh , I 'd love to , Jerry . Great . I 'll come for you around six , if that 's okay . That would be perfect . I 'll see you then , Jerry . Thank you , Caroline . Good-bye . Jerry passed the week-in a daze . A wonderful new world was opening up for him . He thought about Caroline constantly , and eagerly anticipated their next engagement . A hay ride would be the ideal second date . You do n't ask just anyone to go on a hayride . Skating is something you do separately , but a hayride is something you do .. together . There could be several opportunities for floating his arm around her shoulder . Sweet . Bud strongly approved , too . Everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster turned his social life on its ear . Actually , more toward the front of his head . One moment his left eyeball was tucked snugly into its socket where it belonged ; the next moment it had migrated down his cheek , like a mouse peeking out of its hole . The rotting must have progressed further than he realized . Jerry knew it was inevitable , although he had n't cared to dwell on it , but why did it have to happen now ? This week ? So close to the hayride ? He tried to look on the bright side . The eye was still attached . That was worth something . Jerry tried to recall anatomy . Was it the optic nerve that secured the eyeball to the socket ? And when that disintegrated .... What a fix . Jerry immediately sought out Bud . He had to help . He just had to . Both of his eyes had long since vacated the premises . He must know what to do . After hearing his dilemma , Bud said , Well heck , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't we just pop it back in ? Afraid not . The normal rotting of tissue , plus the bugs , plus .... Okay , okay . So what am I going to do ? I have a date with Caroline on Saturday . We 're going on a hayride . I ca n't let her see me like this . Do n't call attention to it and she 'll hardly notice . How could she not notice ? My eye is hanging halfway down my face for gosh sake . Try to keep her on the side of your good eye . I do n't think that 's going to solve much . Listen , Jerry . This is just in the nature of things . You ca n't stop it . I ca n't stop it . We just do the best we can with what we have left of ourselves . Death goes on . But Caroline .... You think she really likes you ? Yes . I do . Then it wo n't matter . Consider this : if one of her eyes fell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , no ... There , you see ? She probably feels exactly the same way . But she 's so pretty . They 're always pretty , in the beginning . But what should I say to her ? Be straightforward . Girls appreciate that . There 's no need to get graphic , of course . Avoid the temptation to seek sympathy . Have a positive , accepting attitude . You still have one good eye , do n't you ? Well , yes .... If you let her know you 're disturbed by it , then you 'll just end up making her feel uncomfortable . She 'll be glad to follow your lead . Once you explain the situation , do n't bring it up again . Soon , you wo n't even remember that your eye is out of its socket , dangling there . I do n't know , Bud .... It will work , Jerry . Trust me . I have n't steered you wrong so far , have I ? Bud was right . His advice had been invaluable . He had common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any surprises on Caroline , so on Saturday morning he called for her . Hi , Caroline . This is Jerry . Well hi , Jerry . How are you ? I 'm fine , Caroline . And yourself ? Fine , thank you . We 're still on for tonight , are n't we ? Yes , of course . But , uh , there 's a little problem . A problem ? I 'm just having some trouble with my eye . Nothing too serious , I hope . Oh , no , no .... It 's just , well , not exactly in the socket anymore . It 's sort of ... hanging down . My goodness . I mean , it 's still attached . No doubt about that . Yes , of course . Silence . I 'm sorry , Jerry said . It 's okay . I understand , I really do . You do ? I sure do . You still have one good eye , do n't you ? Yes . Well , there you go . You mean you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? Yes , I 'll still go on the hayride with you , silly . You 're still the same person I went skating with , are n't you ? Gosh , Caroline , you 're really a swell girl . So I 'll see you this evening and I do n't want to hear another word about it . So long , Caroline . And thank you . Jerry put the eye out of his mind . A few minutes before six he came to Caroline . It 's wise to leave a little early for a date . That way , there 's no need to rush when you arrive at your date 's residence . Makes for a more relaxed and enjoyable experience for everyone . Hi , Jerry . Hi , Caroline . Good evening , Mr. and Mrs. Ames . He felt a warm greeting . Apparently he met with their approval . Caroline looked beautiful . White dress , beads , peace , etc . You look just like yourself , said Jerry . Thank you , Jerry . That 's sweet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry asked . ALI set . " Night mom and dad . We 'll be back by ten-thirty . Good night , Mr. and Mrs. Ames . Do n't worry , I 'll take good care of Caroline . When they arrived at the hayride , the gang was already piling into the rotting hay wagon . Jerry had a few kernels of uneasiness as they approached the wagon . Someone was hooking a chestnut mare into its bridle . Large chunks of flesh were missing from the horse 's flanks . Much of its head was eaten away , a part of the jawbone showing . Nobody was making a fuss about it . Jerry felt his self-confidence soar . When they reached the business end of the wagon , Jerry stepped up first , and offered Caroline a hand . She took it and he pulled her up . Hi , gang ! Jerry said . Hi , Jerry ! the gang replied . Nice to see you , Caroline ! Hi , everybody ! Caroline said . Jerry found a spot for them in the hay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his good eye . No sense drawing attention to the flaw if it could be easily avoided . In a short time the driver hopped up on the front of the wagon , and gently shook the frayed reins . The skeletal horse broke into a trot , its sleigh bells sounding like a death rattle , the wagon rocking forward with the motion . The driver guided the horse along the narrow trail that wound around the frozen pond and through the snowy field . Pine trees , statuary , and ornate white buildings passed by . What a wonderful idea this was , Caroline said . This is really fun . I 'm glad you came along . Caroline patted Jerry on the forearm , then her fingers began to slide down toward his wrist , a clear sign that she was interested in holding hands . Fortunately , Jerry first glanced down at her hand , then saw his own .... Immediately , he brought his arm across his chest and thrust his hand into the hay . Then , he reached across with his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliver , he explained . Oh , let me see . I can take it out . Well it 's in pretty deep . I 'll remove it later . It does n't hurt much at all , really . This seemed to satisfy her . Her fingers were cold , and his were gone . Not all of them , perhaps two , possibly three . All he saw were black , rotted stumps . The digits must have fallen off after he hoisted her up onto the wagon . He had n't even felt their departure . Were they in the wagon ? He scanned the bed in the vicinity of where he had been standing , but he could n't spot them amid the hay and snow . They must have fallen into the snow back on the trail . He 'd never find them . And even if he did , what good would they do him now ? The rest of the hayride Jerry spent in nervous preoccupation with his missing appendages . The eye was bad enough . He did n't want Caroline to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why all of a sudden ? It was almost like the more he tried to have a social life , the more his body rebelled . When the hay wagon returned to their point of departure , the horse collapsing into dust , Jerry helped Caroline down to the ground with his left hand , keeping his right tucked into the pocket of his best suit . He did n't dare search the vicinity for his fingers now . The gang hung out afterward , gossiping and cracking wise like dead teenagers do . Jerry struggled to keep in good spirits . When they got back to her place , it was later than he expected . Say , look at the time , said Jerry . I told your folks I 'd get you home by ten-thirty and here it is , almost eleven . I 'm sure they 'd understand . We are n't very late at all . There was nothing we could do about it , really . I do n't want your parents to think I 'm taking advantage of you . They wo n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it . Thank you for the offer , Caroline . I would just feel better if I took a rain check . You understand , do n't you ! Oh , of course . You 're such a gentleman , Jerry . Next time , I wo n't let you off the hook so easily . Good night , Caroline . Good night , Jerry . She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek , deftly avoiding his droopy eye . Her lips were still chilly from the hayride . Jerry told Bud the rotten news when he returned to his plot . Fingers falling off , eh ? join the club . But what can I do about it ? I ca n't keep company with Caroline like this . She was okay with my eye , but I ca n't expect her to pretend forever . How are we supposed to hold hands ? Doit spiritually . Girls like a boy who has a kind heart . It makes them feel special . I want to feel Caroline , touch her . Use your other hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm surprised it 's still attached . There 's no turning back , Jerry . There 's an old saying around here : If you do n't rest in peace , you 'll come apart in pieces . Look , my prospects are n't too good anyway . I appreciate your willingness to help me , Bud . I 'll think of something . Maybe if we can keep going on group dates I can hide it from her . And then what ? I do n't know . I do n't know . I 'll come up with something . Jerry knew he had to apologize to Caroline , after his behavior on the hayride . The next day he called for her , trying to inject sunshine into his voice . He remembered sunshine , wistfully . Hi , Caroline , this is Jerry . Hello , Jerry . How are you ? Very well , thanks . That 's good . I had a really fun time on the hayride , Jerry . Thank you for taking me . I enjoyed it , too . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize for my behavior at your place . I should n't have run off like that . You said it was okay if I hung around , and I should have trusted you . Oh , gosh Jerry , there 's no need to apologize . I understand . You were just trying to be sweet . You 're not mad at me then ! Of course not . Wow , that 's great to hear , Caroline . I was n't sure . I mean , I did n't know . My eye .... You 're fine , Jerry . How about if I make it up to you anyway ? The gang is going sledding this afternoon . Do you want to go ? Well , to be honest , Jerry , I was hoping we could do something by ourselves once . Oh no .... Uh , what did you have in mind ? Why do n't we just go for a walk ? What do-you say ? Jerry knew what he had to say . Sure , Caroline , that sounds swell . What time do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three it is . Terrific . I 'll see you then . Good-bye , Caroline . Jerry spent the rest of the day wringing his hand . He could n't keep his problem in his pocket all afternoon . He had to be honest with Caroline . If only they had given me gloves , he thought with high melancholy . Three o'clock came like it could n't wait to see him humiliated . Jerry hated the fact that he felt trepidation about seeing Caroline . He wanted to feel excitement , anticipation , affection . Not this squeamish , nervous feeling . On the way over to Caroline 's , Jerry felt an odd sensation and it had nothing to do with his interior life . Something in the region of his feet . Suddenly he had trouble walking . And he did n't have to look to know that his toes had been eaten away by time or worms or some burrowing creature . Jerry did n't get upset , just philosophical . He had hit some kind of plateau , gone from a being with one foot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a decaying corpse with both feet on the verge of rotting off his legs . When his deterioration had been easy to hide , it had been possible to keep up appearances , pass as something he was not . But now , with a dangling eye , stumps instead of fingers , a lot of extra space down at the end of his polished black shoes , there was only one path to take . Jerry presented himself to Caroline as he was , a young man on the downside of his death . He hobbled the rest of the way to her place . She was waiting for him , smelling the plastic flowers . An ice-crusted bouquet of pale purples , reds and yellows . Hi , Caroline . Oh hi , Jerry . I did n't hear you coming . She looked at him with concern . Are you okay ? You 're walking so strangely . This was it . Well , Caroline , you see , my feet are rotting away . And my hand . He displayed it for her . And tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a real mess , are n't I ? Maybe we should just stay here today . We could talk or something . I want to walk , said Jerry . Please walk with me , Caroline . Sure , Jerry . I 'll walk with you . They slowly strolled among the monuments and trees , stark oaks coated with ice , evergreens hanging heavy with snow . The moon was circled by a pale orange halo . Why is it happening now , so fast ? Caroline gently asked him . Just the other day you were fine . Bud says it 's because I wo n't rest in peace . Have I met Bud ? I 'm not sure . Bud Pollard . 1959-1976 . Loving son devoted student friend of the community . Oh , yes , I remember seeing him . He 's a good guy . He 's always given me helpful advice . I 'm so sorry , Jerry . What are you going to do ? They had reached a bench sheltered by a hedge planted in an arc . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His gait was a rolling , teetering travesty . Let 's sit down , Jerry said , and she helped him do that . She was seated on his left , so he was able to hold her hand properly . Caroline put her head on his shoulder . The decay had n't hit there yet . We need to have a talk , Jerry said . Okay . They looked at each other , his dangling eye trying to get into the act , too . You know , Caroline , you 're the first girl I 've kept company with since I came here . And even ifI would have known that dating you would make me decompose to beat the band , I would n't have changed a thing , that 's how much I 've treasured our time together . I feel the same way . Listen , Jerry , pretty soon what 's happening to you will overtake me , too . My eyeballs will go pop , toes and fingers fall off , bits and pieces eaten away . And the bugs .... We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before all that happens . Yes , is n't it wonderful ? Yes , but I 'm withering away so quickly , said Jerry . I do n't know how long I 've got before I wo n't be able to go for walks , or ice skating , or anything . Your suit still looks sharp . I do n't want to rush us , Caroline , but those are the facts . If we let the days go by thinking things will always be the way they are now , one day we 'll wake up and I 'll just be a pile of sludge you used to call a friend . Oh , Jerry , please , do n't talk like that . We have to face it , Caroline . We ca n't deny this . He reached out for her with his rotting stump . She drew her hand away . He gazed grimly at her . This is our future , Caroline . In a few days you 're going to be afraid to even look at me . A few remnant tears squeezed themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry . I promise . Jerry hesitated for a moment . What I 'm saying , Caroline , is that if you want us to have any sort of .. physical relationship , we ca n't wait . Caroline 's peaceful , natural face was clouded with sadness . I 'm sorry it has to be like this , said Jerry . I know this is n't considered good dating etiquette . It 's not proper to pressure a girl into intimate relations . If there was another way .... No , you 're right , she said . We have to face this . I do n't want death to be denial , too . They sat in quiet spaces for a time , holding hands . A nuthatch lit on an evergreen branch , then flew off when it realized it was n't alone . Its weight disturbed the branch , sending a dusting of snow down upon the heads of the dead . So , Caroline , Jerry said shyly , do you want to go back to my place ? I 'd love to . JERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not much , he said , but it 's home . I like it . It 's cozy . Are you comfortable ? he asked her . I 'm just fine . It 's nice to be so close to you . Do n't worry about hurting me . I wo n't . Can we do something about that eye ? It 's sort of in the way . Oh , sure . Hang on ... got it . Is that better ? Much better . Now I can touch your face all over . He began to touch her , too . You do n't think I 'm easy , Jerry , do you ? No , of course not . Have there been other girls ... like me ? No , only the living . That makes me feel good . As they began to probe and pet , and then proceed to the most private of realms , Jerry felt parts of himself break away , disintegrate . His fine suit slowly collapsed in upon itself , soaking up what remained of his bodily fluids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know why . I have very strong feelings for you , Caroline whispered to him . I feel the same about you . What 's wrong with me ? he wondered . This should be the crowning moment of my death . Why do I feel so terrible , so guilt-wracked , so ... wrong ? Caroline sensed it , too . What 's going on ? Are you okay ? I 'm okay , he said . I 'm okay . But he was n't . This felt so illicit , so ... immoral . At the very moment they consummated their deaths , as his body rotted away to utter uselessness , a shock of awareness hit him , as he understood what had disturbed him , why everything had felt so wrong . And why now everything was feeling so right . The final dating secret . Jerry realized , as both , of Caroline 's eyes popped out upon her climax , and their precious ooze commingled , that if a living person has intimate relations with a dead body , it 's called necrophilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be love .
