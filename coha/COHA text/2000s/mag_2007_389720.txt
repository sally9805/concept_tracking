It may be better to give than to receive , but being a benefactor can also be exhausting . A FEW YEARS AGO , I was walking through Philadelphia 's Rittenhouse Square on a summer afternoon with my oldest sister , Deborah . Up ahead , we spotted a shirtless and suntanned panhandler who was a fixture in this neighborhood back then . As usual , he was cheerfully inebriated and loudly seeking donations for what he called his " buy me a beer " fund . Deborah is a charitable soul who 's worked in nonprofit organizations for most of her career and regularly donates time and money to a variety of causes . I knew , however , that this begging for booze really bothered her ; she felt it was an insult to those who were truly needy . As the vagrant stretched out his hand , I expected my sister to glide serenely past , ignoring him . Instead , she suddenly blurted out : " Leave me alone ! I wo n't buy you a beer now or ever . Never ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so upset . Today , as I sometimes hesitate to answer the telephone for fear of yet another heartrending solicitation ( my alma mater ! Greenpeace ! Hillary ! ) , I 'll think of my sister . And when it seems that at nearly every dinner party I attend , someone will corner me with an urgent plea that I help stop global warming or encourage modern dance , I 'll recall her frustrated outburst . As Deborah was , I 'm sometimes ready to snap from donor 's fatigue . According to the Chicago-based American Institute of Philanthropy ( AIP ) , there are more than 1.8 million nonprofit organizations in this country . As the government continues to cut social-service budgets , appeals from the private sector are becoming increasingly clamorous . Donate to any , though , and you can soon expect to hear from many more , as lists compiled by one organization are soon sold to others . Contrary to the anguished speech Portia makes to Shylock in Shakespeare 's Merchant of Venice , sometimes the quality of mercy is strained . Typical , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives in Santa Fe , New Mexico . " Santa Fe is a small town , but I get invitations to probably four to six events a month , " she says . " It 's because I used to use the " shotgun " approach to charity and give small amounts of money to all the local causes . I thought this would be a great way to spread the wealth , but it ended up creating a whole lot more invitations to a whole lot more benefits . Some of them now come from causes I 'd never support , places that even make me angry . " Once you 're visible as someone who gives , it 's also often assumed that you have access to the purse strings of others . Gillian Miniter , who is a vice president of the Women 's Committee for the Central Park Conservancy , in New York City , knows this only too well . " When they see you 're effective in one group , people target you and want you to get involved in their organizations , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at raising money and that I could make a difference , I realized it was better to be fully committed to only a few things and that I needed to focus . " The cure for donor 's fatigue is not to stop giving but to give more carefully , believes Daniel Borochoff , AIP president . " People are far too passive with regard to their charitable donations , " he says . " They give because the phone rings or a gala invitation arrives in the mail . Instead , they should be introspective , reflect upon what their goals and ideals are and then come up with a plan . If you have more confidence in what you want to support , you can more easily tell others that their proposals do n't fit your priorities . " Trent Stamp , head of Charity Navigator , America 's largest independent charity evaluator , based in Mahwah , New Jersey , agrees . " I am amazed by the number of wealthy , powerful people who have highly organized plans for their businesses , investments and retirement but leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . Stamp advises that it is much better to thank callers for contacting you but explain that you ca n't give to charity A , since you are aggressively supporting charity B. Be polite , but only to a point . " No one wants to look stingy or selfish , but it 's okay to reject people , " he says . Gracefully rebuffing a stranger 's pitch is one thing , but what about when it 's your next-door neighbor , nephew or client who wants you to support a pet project ? In these situations , it 's important to distinguish between different forms of benefaction . There is true altruism , whereby you give from the heart , because you want to do something good , or " repair the world , " in Borochoff 's phrase . Also important , though , are more self-interested ways of giving , what Stamp calls " charitable quid pro quo . " This phenomenon is especially prevalent among the very affluent , or in smaller communities where involvement in a fundraising campaign for the local university or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everybody wants to get in good with other people , " Stamp explains . " Even Donald Trump needs backers and investors . So he will give to their causes in order to curry favor . There is nothing wrong with this ; it is an important part of philanthropy . " " Charity can be about connections and whom you know , " admits Laughlin , who now focuses her philanthropy on the Farmers ' Market Institute in Santa Fe . " If somebody buys a ticket to my benefit , I feel that I have to buy one for hers . " Maybe . Maybe not . This is where it takes some soul-searching and intestinal fortitude . Ask yourself : does your social standing or future business success depend on your making a donation or lending your name , time or influence to a particular organization ? If so , write the check for as much as you can afford . ( " When the boss 's daughter is a Girl Scout , even if you 're on a diet , you buy the cookies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then have the courage of your convictions . Just because your best friend wants you to support PETA or the ballet , it does n't mean that you have to . Develop the strength to tell him you 've decided to put your money elsewhere . And guess what ? You may actually gain some respect in the process . " As a fundraiser , I much prefer it when someone tells me , " I ca n't do it right now ; I am overcommitted . ' This is far better than if they say yes or maybe , and then ultimately do n't come through , " concludes Miniter . " Someone told me once that the people who give the most money are also the best at saying no . " When You Have to Decline Gird yourself . People often regard their favorite charities with great affection and can become offended when others do n't support them . Prepare yourself for that reaction . Be realistic . It 's preferable to risk alienating an acquaintance you encounter twice a year rather than a friend you see twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated , you can still express concern and curiosity . Give elsewhere . You are not a miser when you decline to support a particular organization . Instead , you have an opportunity to say a more wholehearted yes to another . Do n't forget . Keep track of the requests you reject . You should not seek a contribution from someone whose own cause you declined to support . Make an effort . Not being able to write a check does n't automatically prevent you from giving in another way : volunteer your time instead .
