Prizefighter en Mi Casa By e . E. Charlton-Trujillo Random House e . E. Charlton-Trujillo 1 A gutted pumpkin glowed from across the street . The streetlight closest to the house got shot out almost one whole year ago so I could barely see nothing . Nothing but that glowing orange head without a body . I sat on the porch swing hoping to stay outta Mama 's way . She was in one of those moods again where she cursed the saints she 'd be praying to later . Being Mexican and Catholic requires a lotta prayers . Even if they never seem to be answered you 're still supposed to make ' em . But I 'd quit that after all the glass . The latch on the gate banged shut only I could n't see nothing but a shape , a moving shadow with footsteps . Footsteps that made the porch stairs cry and moan . It walked right past me sitting on the swing and knocked on the screen door . I sat there all quiet but the swing squeaked . The Shape turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was big . Really , really , really all kinds of big . The porch light flicked on and the Shape winced and fell back a step . Like when you go out into the sun after being somewhere really dark . Mama opened the screen door saying " Hector " over her shoulder to my father . Mama and I kinda stared . I could n't believe that was the man my father believed was our family 's gold . The wheels of Pape 's chair grinded againstour wood floor . " Come in , come in , " Pape said from inside the doorway . Mama held the door open and took the Dark One 's suitcase as he slipped inside . " Chula , " Mama said . " Get off the swing and get in here . " I started shaking my head . " Andale , " she said . " I 'm not telling you again . " I pushed off the swing and went to the door . " What did you say to him ? " she asked me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like it or not , that is all we have . God help us , " Mama said . " So do n't do anything to upset him . Bueno ? " I stood there not saying nothing . " What ? I do n't have all night , " said Mama . " Get in here . " I ducked under her arm and followed her into the kitchen . " Get the iced tea , " said Mama . " Hello , Abuela , " I said to my grandmother . Abuela leaned back in a chair at the kitchen table . Smiling , with her hands crossed in her lap . Her eyes half-open , half-closed like cats when they go to sleeping . Only she was n't sleeping . Not really . " The tray , Chula , " said Mama . " Come on . " Mama poured a bag of Tostitos into our sort of fancy lime-colored plastic bowl . She stepped around me and grabbed the homemade picante sauce out of the fridge . " It 's staying with To Tony , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is El Jefe and that is what you and your brother are to call him , " said Mama . " Or he might do worse than kill us , " my dumb older brother Richie said , strutting into the kitchen all tough-like . " He might box our ears off so we ca n't hear nothing . " " Shut up , " I said . Richie grinned , chomping into a chip . " No sir , " Mama said , pulling the bowl away . " This is for El Jefe . " " Pues , you see the size of that guy ? " Richie asked Mama . " He 's like the Mexican Hulk . " Richie stuck his hand back in the bowl and she slapped it . " Qu pas ? " asked Richie . " No jokes . No nothing , " said Mama . " This man has come a long way to help this family . " Then she looked at me . " And he 's staying here . " I looked at her like she 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mama walked over to Abuela and squeezed her hands . Abuela did n't do nothing . Not even blink . If her chest was n't moving up and down , I would 've thought she done died . Done died right there in South Texas dreaming of Mexico . Mama turned on the radio . We only had one in the house and it played only for Abuela . Sometimes she 'd get to looking too distant from us and closer to God , and Pape did n't like seeing his mama like that . The music seemed to return part of her to us , even if it was only for a while . But one thing I learned about a while in my family , it was never very long but it was longer than never and you always have to aim for that . Never means nada and nada means nothing and we want more than that , Mama always says . You must always want more than your history . Mama weighted me down with the tray of cups and iced tea . Richie scooped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pape was smiling and happier than I 'd seen him in like forever when we came into the living room . Mama stacked the magazines and free TV guide from the neighbor 's Sunday newspaper under the coffee table so she 'd have a place to put tea and chips . " I 'm sorry , " said Mama to the Dark One . " We were n't expecting you until tomorrow morning . " He nodded but did n't take his eyes off the floor . Really his eye ' cause he only had one . The other was under a dusty patch with clawlike scars that went up all high on his head and spread outta the bottom like crooked fingers . I wondered if they hurt as much as the one on the side of my head . Mama took the tray and chips from me and Richie and I stood there still looking at the creature out of the corner of our eyes . No way could it be true that Pape useta stick up for El Jefe when he was little . How could that Cyclops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
