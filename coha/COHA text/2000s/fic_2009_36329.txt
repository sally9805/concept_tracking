1 <p> It was the persistent sense of impending doom , not the nor'easter , that made Natalie flee from Cape Cod back to New Jersey in the predawn hours of Monday morning . She had expected to find sanctuary in the cozy Cape house that had once been her grandmother 's and now was hers , but the icy sleet beating against the windows only increased the terror she was experiencing . Then , when a power failure plunged the house into darkness , she lay awake , sure that every sound was caused by an intruder . <p> After fifteen years , she was certain that she had accidentally stumbled upon the knowledge of who had strangled her roommate , Jamie , when they were both struggling young actresses . And he knows that I know , she thought  --  I could see it in his eyes . <p> On Friday night , he had come with a group to the closing night of A Streetcar Named Desire at the Omega Playhouse . She had played Blanche DuBois , the most demanding and satisfying role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the role had taken its emotional toll on her . That was why , after the performance , when someone knocked on the door of her dressing room , she had been tempted not to answer . But she had , and they all crowded in to congratulate her , and out of nowhere she recognized him . In his late forties now , his face had filled out , but he was undoubtedly the person whose picture was missing from Jamie 's wallet after her body was found . Jamie had been so secretive about him , only referring to him as Jess , " my pet name for him , " as she put it . <p> I was so shocked that when we were introduced , I called him " Jess , " Natalie thought . Everyone was talking so much that I am sure no one else noticed . But he heard me say his name . <p> Who do I tell ? Who would believe me ? My word against his ? My memory of a small picture that Jamie had hidden in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her my Visa card and I needed it back . She was in the shower and called to me to get it out of her wallet . That was when I saw the picture , tucked in one of the compartments , behind a couple of business cards . <p> All Jamie ever told me about him was that he 'd tried his hand at acting and was n't good enough , and that he was in the middle of a divorce . I tried to tell her that was the oldest story in the world , Natalie thought , but she would n't listen . She and Jamie had been sharing an apartment on the West Side until that terrible morning when Jamie was strangled while jogging early in Central Park . Her wallet was on the ground , her money and watch were missing . And so wasthe picture of " Jess . " I told the cops that , she thought , but they did n't take it seriously . There had been a number of early-morning muggings in the park and they were sure Jamie just happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim , as it turned out . <p> It had been pouring through Rhode Island and Connecticut , but as Natalie drove down the Palisades Parkway the rain steadily lessened . As she drove farther down , she could see that the roads were already drying . <p> Would she feel safe at home ? She was n't sure . Twenty years ago , after being widowed , her mother , born and raised in Manhattan , had been happy to sell the house and buy a small apartment near Lincoln Center . Last year , when Natalie and Gregg separated , she heard that the modest house in northern New Jersey where she 'd been raised was for sale again . <p> " Natalie , " her mother warned , " you 're making a terrible mistake . I think you 're crazy not to try to make a go of your marriage . Running back home is never the answer for anyone . You ca n't recreate the past . " <p> Natalie knew it was impossible to make her mother understand that the kind of wife Gregg wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . " I was unfair to Gregg when I married him , " she said . " He needed a wife who would be a real mother to Katie . I ca n't be . Last year I was away a total of six months in all . It just is n't working . I honestly think that when I move out of Manhattan , he 'll understand that the marriage is really over . " <p> " You 're still in love with him , " her mother insisted . " And he is with you . " <p> " That does n't mean we 're good for each other . " <p> I 'm right about that , Natalie thought , as she swallowed the lump in her throat that was always there when she allowed herself to think about Gregg . She wished she could talk to him about what had happened Friday evening . What would she say ? " Gregg , what do I do about having the certain knowledge that I know who killed my friend Jamie , without a shred of proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him . There was too much of a chance that she 'd be unable to resist his begging her to try again . Even though she 'd lied and told him she was interested in someone else , it had n't stopped Gregg 's phone calls . <p> As she turned off the parkway onto Walnut Street , Natalie realized she was longing for a cup of coffee . She had driven straight through and it was quarter of eight . By this time , on a normal day , she would already have had at least two cups . <p> Most of the houses on Walnut Street in Closter had been torn down to make way for new luxury homes . It was her joke that now she had seven-foot hedges on either side of her house , giving her complete privacy from either neighbor . Years ago , the Keenes had been on one side and the Foleys on the other . Today , she hardly knew who her neighbors were . <p> The sense of something hostile hit her as she turned in to her driveway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door began to rise , she shook her head . Gregg had been right when he said that she became every character she played . Even before the stress of meeting Jess , her nerves had been unraveling , like those of Blanche DuBois . <p> She drove into the garage , stopped , but for some reason did not immediately push the clicker to close the garage door behind her . Instead , she opened the driver 's door of the car , pushed open the kitchen door , and stepped inside . <p> She felt gloved hands dragging her in , twirling her around , and throwing her down . The crack of her head on the hardwood floor sent waves of pain radiating through her skull , but she could still see that he was wearing a plastic raincoat and plastic over his shoes . <p> " Please , " she said , " please . " She held up her hands to protect herself from the pistol he was pointing at her chest . <p> The click as he pushed down the safety catch was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continues ...
