Today the Elan School in Poland Spring , Maine , is just that  --  a school . But in the years from 1978 to 1980 , it was something else  --  an exclusive drug and alcohol clinic for children of the rich and famous . This was where Michael Skakel , 19 , a nephew of Ethel Kennedy 's and a son of wealth and privilege , spent two years drying out . And according to a book proposal circulated briefly last year by the now 39-year-old Skakel and writer Richard Hoffman , Elan was the scene of a flamboyant  --  and possibly fateful  --  therapy . Those who have seen the proposal for Dead Man Talking : A Kennedy Cousin Comes Clean say that in it Skakel describes being made to wear a sign around his neck . It read : I AM AN ARROGANT RICH BRAT . CONFRONT ME ON WHY I KILLED MY FRIEND MARTHA . <P> The book proposal was eventually withdrawn . But the document circulated , and last week , 25 years after the bludgeoning of Martha Moxley in Greenwich , Conn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indicted for her murder . Police showed up to arrest Skakel at the half-million-dollar Florida home he shares with his golf-pro wife and child , but he was already on a plane north . He turned himself in to Connecticut police , pleaded not guilty and was released on $500,000 bail . <P> Once an accomplished speed skier , Skakel is amiable , a faithful member of Alcoholics Anonymous and an increasingly devout Catholic . He worked as a driver in Ted Kennedy 's re-election campaign in 1994 , then took a similar job with cousin Michael Kennedy 's nonprofit Citizens Energy Corp . In 1997 , however , Skakel talked to police about his cousin 's affair with a 15-year-old babysitter . ( Michael died in a 1997 skiing accident . ) Soon after , Skakel moved from Massachusetts into the Florida house owned by his father in an expensive gated community . Still , Robert Kennedy Jr . told the New York Times last week that Skakel " is as honest as daylight ... a genuinely good and decent soul . " <P> He may yet defeat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and a quarter-century of sloppy detective work . And last week 's drama notwithstanding , there may be no earthly penalty sufficient for whoever left a 15-year-old girl lying in her own blood . <P> Martha Moxley 's mother Dorthy last saw her daughter alive on Halloween Eve 1975 . Martha wore a blue parka and was skipping out the door of the sumptuous house the family had settled into just the year before , joining a group that included two across-the-lane neighbors , Thomas Skakel , 17 , and his 15-year-old brother Michael . If the Moxleys were well off , the Skakels were Greenwich royalty . Rushton Skakel was chairman of Great Lakes Carbon , one of the world 's largest privately held companies . In a union of money , power and more money , Skakel 's sister Ethel had married Bobby Kennedy in 1950 , making Rushton 's seven children Kennedy cousins . Martha Moxley , pretty , vivacious and popular , became part of their crowd . ( Later Dorthy found a diary entry in which Martha recounted fending off Tommy 's attempts to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Halloween Eve , and Martha , though officially grounded for an earlier infraction , begged her mother to let her go out for pranks . Dorthy gave in.
