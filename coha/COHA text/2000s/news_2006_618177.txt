<p> TROY ( 1-1 ) AT GEORGIA TECH ( 1-1 ) * 1:30 P.M. * NO TV * 790 AM <p> DO N'T BLINK : Anything can happen <p> This game should be fun . <p> Troy plays five-receiver sets in a no-huddle offense , and Georgia Tech plays a **29;8848;TOOLONG defense . <p> Tech plays a Calvin Johnson-Reggie Ball-Tashard Choice offense , and Troy plays an aggressive , high-speed defense . <p> There will be speed all over the field . <p> Expect a lot of things to happen . Fast . <p> Troy has completed passes to 13 receivers , including quarterback Omar Haugabook . The Trojans throw a lot of short passes  --  average completion 8.2 yards  --  and hope to get a big gain now and then from a missed tackle or blown coverage . They do n't need to run the ball well to be successful ; they scored 17 points against Florida State despite running for 24 yards . <p> Tech keeps adding new dimensions to its offense . After showing spread formations and shotgun looks in the opener against Notre Dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Yellow Jackets also can run wide with an option look , and Ball always is a threat to keep it on a bootleg or a quarterback draw . <p> " You do n't see many offenses that can go three wide and then come back and run it up the middle , " Troy linebacker Ryan Babb said . " We have to be on our toes . " <p> Tech has to be on its toes , too . <p> " What jumps out at you is their speed , " Tech coach Chan Gailey said . " That 's the one thing on both sides of the ball and the kicking game , they have great speed . They 're not the biggest team out there , but they can all run , they hit you on defense , they swarm to the ball . They make big hits and knock balls loose . " <p> WINNING TRADITION <p> Troy is 29-31 since joining Division I-A for the 2001 season but was 92-29-1 under coach Larry Blakeney before that . Here are the most victories by an Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> School ... Wins <p> Troy ... 121 <p> Auburn ... 121 <p> N. Alabama .. 120 <p> Alabama ... 118 <p> Tuskegee ... 110 <p> Samford ... 93 <p> MULTIPLE TARGETS : WRs to lend a hand <p> Other guys out to prove it 's not a one-man corps <p> It 's likely to be an ongoing story as long as Calvin Johnson wears a Georgia Tech uniform . <p> On the one hand , there 's the " Get the ball to Calvin " argument , the idea that however many passes you throw his way , it can never be enough . Why not take advantage of having one of the best receivers in college football ? <p> On the other hand , there 's the " Take what the defense gives you " argument , the idea that throwing too often to Johnson , even when he 's double-covered , will lead to more interceptions and more incompletions . Why not have quarterback Reggie Ball take advantage of the talented receivers left open when the defense focuses on Johnson ? <p> There 's truth in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Tech 's " other " receivers are out to prove they can deliver when called upon . Games such as today 's  --  and last week 's against Samford  --  are crucial for them to make their case . <p> " The receivers want to let Reggie know that there 's more than just Calvin . There 's all of us out there , " said James Johnson , who , like Calvin Johnson , caught four passes from Ball in last week 's 38-6 victory . <p> Redshirt freshman Greg Smith started in Tech 's three-receiver set and also caught a pass from Ball . <p> James Johnson 's formula for winning Ball 's confidence : " Keep doing what we 're doing in practice and in games keep showing up , making the big catches every time he throws us the ball , not even drop one , so we let him know that , ' OK , I can throw it to him . I can trust him . ' <p> " You do n't want to lose sight of Calvin . You want Calvin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reggie know when Calvin 's double-covered , he can throw it to someone else . " <p> A BIG PLAY IS COMING : McGuire has been sniffing out a block <p> It has been more than a season since Georgia Tech blocked a punt , but Xavier McGuire is likely to block another . Soon . <p> McGuire , who got Tech 's last block in the 2004 Champs Sports Bowl against Syracuse , has been close to blocking three punts in the first two games . McGuire does n't always rush from the same spot . Did the coaches spot a weakness in Notre Dame and Samford 's punt protection ? <p> " Mostly it 's been Xavier really giving great effort , " Tech coach Chan Gailey said . " We talk about where to go and get everybody , try to get them on the edge , but he 's got a knack for slicing through there and finding a crease . " <p> " Every time you get close to one , you see that it 's possible that you can get it , " McGuire said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like you might as well not have come close . <p> " It 's good to get pressure . There 's really no secret . You just rush . You 're just like a defensive lineman rushing upfield . You just try to get a good jump on the ball and rush upfield and maybe affect the punt or tip the ball or even block it . " <p> STRANGE LINE : Oddsmakers short on respect for Troy <p> Reconcile these three facts : <p> * Georgia Tech has scored fewer than 17 points in five of its past six games . <p> * Tech is a 17-point favorite . <p> * Today 's opponent , Troy , led Florida State midway through the fourth quarter last week at Tallahassee . <p> The only logical conclusion : A lot of people who bet think Tech is on the way up and Troy is due for a letdown . <p> The Trojans benefited from an interception , three fumbles and a muffed punt . <p> " Florida State went into that game looking like they were thinking they were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had nothing to lose , they just played hard and got in Florida State 's face , and it looked like they got Florida State a little shaken , " Tech receiver James Johnson said . <p> " Troy played like they had nothing to lose , and they 've got that again against us . We 've got to make sure we do n't underestimate them , or we 'll be in the same boat Florida State was . " <p> Tech 's starters had plenty of time to watch the scoreboard while sitting out most of the second half of last week 's 38-6 victory over Samford . They saw the FSU-Troy game was scoreless through the first quarter . That got their attention . And then they heard how hard the Seminoles had to work for a 24-17 victory . <p> " If Florida State would have blown them out , we probably would have looked at them like it 's just another game , " Johnson said . " I 'm glad that happened so we can say , ' Hey , this team is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> HARD ROAD <p> Since moving up to Division I-A , Troy is 1-17 in away games against teams from Bowl Championship Series conferences : <p> Year ...

FSU ... L , 24-17 <p> FAST-PACED OFFENSE : With no huddle , little time to adjust <p> Georgia Tech 's defense makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and personnel groupings changing from a base of three linebackers and four defensive backs to a nickel package of two linebackers and five defensive backs to a third grouping of three linemen , three linebackers and five defensive backs . Tech might not be able to switch so much today . <p> That 's because Troy runs a no-huddle offense . <p> Coaches signal instructions to two players ; quarterback Omar Haugabook gets the play , and center Zach Yenser gets the offensive line assignments . <p> " Everything 's off wristbands , " said Yenser , who wears one just like many college quarterbacks . " It 's a blast . It 's fast-paced . Things are just really intense . Our offensive line coach always tells us to play hard and play fast . " <p> NO ROOM TO RUN : Little LBs pack pretty big hit <p> Neither of Troy 's first two opponents managed 2 yards per carry . Alabama State ran 33 times for 65 yards ; Florida State ran 28 times for 45 . <p> The most amazing thing about that defense is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 5 feet 11 and 198 pounds of him , switched from running back for his senior season and leads the team in tackles , shares the team lead in sacks and has forced three fumbles in two games . <p> " I was excited about the move , " Babb said . " It meant coaches had faith in me and wanted to put me in a position where I could help the team out . Reading offenses was n't too hard for me . It was really just getting formations down , where to line up . " <p> Troy 's little linebackers  --  Babb plays alongside 204-pound middle linebacker Josh Maxwell and 214-pound strongside linebacker Marcus Richardson  --  get the job done with their speed , and a pair of 280-pounders in the middle of the defensive line keep the Trojans from being overpowered by bigger opponents . <p> CAN TROY CHALLENGE AGAIN ? Back-to-back ACC contests <p> Troy players say their strong showing against Florida State last week was a beginning , not an end in itself . They reject the notion they ca n't rebound emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's vitally important that we do get as high as we did for last week , " linebacker Ryan Babb said . " To have two games back-to-back like this is great for our program , to see where we are , to see how we stack up against ' big-name teams . ' I put quotes around it because I think we are a big-name team . " <p> Said center Zach Yenser , a senior from Marietta 's Harrison High School , " Going into the Florida State game , I thought we had a chance . We just did n't finish . That 's something we 've got to work on for the rest of the year . <p> " I think we 're up for the challenge of Georgia Tech .
