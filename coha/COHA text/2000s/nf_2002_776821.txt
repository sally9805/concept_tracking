Part One // Zion // 1842-1860 // Walk about Zion , and go round about her ; tell the towers thereof . Mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces , that ye may tell it to the generation following . // - Psalms 48:12-13 // The Preacher // In the blind man 's memory , the river ran west . It was in the spring of 1846 when young Francis Parkman had first looked on the Missouri , and he had seen clearly that its wide and silty waters flowed east to the Mississippi . But when he closed his faltering eyes in a clinic on Staten Island in 1847 and began to dictate the story of his adventure of the previous year , he had already begun to think like the great historian he would soon become . As he scanned in his mind the lines of passengers and clots of wagons and piles of goods crowding the St. Louis levee , as he recalled the sound of steamboat paddles slapping and churning against the Missouri 's current , he could see the life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an artery . In the most important sense , the river ran west.1 // Parkman did not record how he arrived in St. Louis from his home in Boston , but he undoubtedly spent most of his trip on the water . It was virtually his only choice . Most roads amounted to little more than muddy ravines-in Missouri , it was said that roads were worn , not made-and the first , pioneering railways had yet to cover much territory . So , whenever possible , Americans set out in schooners and square-rigged ships , paddlewheel steamboats , or mule-drawn canal barges . He might have taken a ship to New Orleans , then a riverboat north ; or he could have sailed up the Hudson , been towed down the Erie Canal , then shipped through the Great Lakes before crossing to descend the Mississippi , or taking another canal to reach the mighty Ohio.2 // North and south , east and west , these flowing highways met at the metropolis of St. Louis . One of Parkman 's contemporaries , a farm woman named Elizabeth Carter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like bees . " The water off the city 's tightly packed levee presented a breathtaking spectacle , as dozens of teetering , wedding-cake paddlewheelers pressed in to find a landing . " The steamboats were strung up and down the river for miles as close as they could stand , " she wrote to her family in Kentucky.3 // Some fifty of those vessels regularly plied the Missouri River , hauling passengers and goods between St. Louis and the state 's inner river towns . But the twenty-two-year-old Parkman 's imagination was captured by the immense throng of settlers and traders bound for Oregon , California , and Santa Fe . " The hotels were crowded , " he wrote , " and the gunsmiths and saddlers were kept constantly at work in providing arms and equipments for the different parties of travellers . " 4 // On April 28 , 1846 , Parkman left St. Louis on a Missouri steamer named the Radnor . " The boat was loaded until the water broke alternately over the guards , " he recalled . " Her upper-deck was covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fe trade , and her hold was crammed with goods for the same destination . There were also equipments and provisions of a party of Oregon emigrants , a band of mules and horses , piles of saddles and harness . " // For the next week , the heavily laden steamboat chugged up the winding river , forcing its way against the swift current . The Missouri ran high in the spring , making the pilot 's job simpler-but not simple . The channel constantly shifted back and forth across the soft-soiled floodplain ; sandbars swelled into islands and then dissolved ; snags of drifting dead trees came and went , threatening to spear the hull of a poorly guided boat . Everything rested on the pilot 's knowledge and skill . He had to learn and relearn the river , read the water for shoals and snags , know how to time a burst of steam to carry the boat through a shallow chute . It was a dangerous career . Between boiler explosions and the river 's own obstacles , an average of three boats each year sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lives at a time . The pilot , Mark Twain later wrote , ruled over his vessel " in glory , " trumping even the captain in pay and authority.5 // During that week , the Radnor existed as a floating town , piled high and trailing a cloud of smoke . The average boat was a sidewheeler , some 165 feet long and 28 feet wide-though they often reached 250 feet with a 40-foot beam-and some could hold as many as 400 passengers . " In her cabin were Santa Fe traders , gamblers , speculators , and adventurers of various descriptions , " Parkman observed , " and her steerage was crowded with Oregon emigrants , ' mountain men , ' negroes , and a party of Kanzas Indians , who had been on a visit to St. Louis . " Also on board , unmentioned by the young Bostonian , would have been country lawyers , frontier merchants , and farmers returning home , along with dozens of women , children , and teenagers . " The young people seemed to enjoy themselves very well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and dancing every night . " 6 // " In five or six days we began to see signs of the great western movement that was then taking place , " Parkman recalled . Tents and wagons began to appear on the bank as the boat drew near Independence . When the Radnor steamed in to the landing , he gaped at the wild diversity of the scene : dozens of Mexicans , " gazing stupidly out from beneath their broad hats " ; clusters of Native Americans , gathered silently around campfires ; a few long-haired , buckskin-clad French hunters , fresh from the mountains ; and crowds of Anglo-Saxon pioneers.7 // There was probably no other place in the country like Missouri 's western border . The aptly named town of Westport served as the access point between the settled states and the Great Plains , the Rocky Mountains , and the Pacific coast . Traders came and went , spending the Spanish silver coins they acquired in Santa Fe ; Native Americans of countless nations and cultures visited and passed through ; and settlers departed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emigrants had departed for Oregon just three years before , starting a steady flow to that distant territory ; and now the Mormons were gathering for a long trek west that would end at Great Salt Lake , deep in Mexican territory . Westport 's shops were filled with the sounds of English , Spanish , French , along with the occasional German and various Indian languages . // And yet , as wild as the region might have seemed to the eye , it was hardly a raw , untamed frontier . A full decade before Parkman 's arrival , one writer thought that many of the towns " would lead the visitor to believe , were he governed by appearances , that he was in the heart of the best settlements of one of the older states . " A few years afterward , another visitor made a telling observation : Missouri 's western border , he wrote , " is fenced up all on one side with old and well improved farms as far east as we could see , while on the right . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard against this boundary-next to the vast plains that President Andrew Jackson had set aside as the " permanent Indian frontier " - sat this long-settled , thriving community , bustling with commerce . Hemp and tobacco fields abounded ; river towns rang with noise from carriage workshops , tobacco stemmeries , and leaf-prizing houses , as well as ropewalks , where hemp 's rough fibers were turned into twine . Both farmers and merchants prospered by selling supplies to the migrants marching by . Passing wagon trains kept cobblers , saddle makers , and blacksmiths busy ; they also provided a major market for locally raised food and livestock . In May 1848 , for example , outfitter Edward M. Samuel in the town of Liberty announced that he needed at least two thousand pounds of bacon to keep up with demand.9 // When Parkman looked over these Missourians , he found them " yellow-visaged , " with " lank angular proportions , enveloped in brown homespun , evidently cut and adjusted by the hands of a domestic female tailor . " Though his description seems at odds with this general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything had a handmade look out here , on the far end of the bending limb of the Missouri River . " From all I have seen , " Elizabeth Carter wrote from Clay County , " I would judge that the people are very plain . " Even residents whose homes dated back to the early 1820s sometimes lived in log cabins , though well-improved ones ; many used walnut or butternut oil to die their homespun clothes a distinctive brown , earning these people the nickname " butternuts. " 10 // Butternuts could be found all across Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , and Ohio , where they had moved from the upper South-especially from Kentucky , the great fountain of settlers that flooded the Ohio and Mississippi valleys in the early nineteenth century . They went by other nicknames as well , such as crackers , hoosiers , pukes , and rednecks-terms that originated in Ulster , Scotland , and northern England , where this long movement of peoples began a century earlier . Even the wealthiest among them-those who could afford fine wool and cotton clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resort to violence , for example , to resolve private disputes or keep public order.11 // Parkman continued on into the vast expanse of the Great Plains , where he joined a wandering Oglala band of the Lakota people ; but when he turned in his saddle to glance over his shoulder , settled Missouri itself looked like an alien land to his Harvard-bred , Bostonian eyes . How different it must have seemed to another passenger who stepped off a steamboat that spring ; to him , Missouri 's western reaches would have been little less than Zion . // This man had also spent a slow week in early 1846 on a paddlewheeler from St. Louis , as it churned toward the setting sun . If he had been aboard the Radnor , Parkman would have noticed him : he was a commanding figure , a tall man with a long , thin face , his hair parted on one side and combed across to leave his high forehead bare . Perhaps he carried a Bible when he appeared in the dining room for his meals ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better known to his Baptist neighbors as brother or Preacher James.12 // He probably disembarked at Liberty landing , in Clay County , across the river from Independence . There he would have hired a horse or a wagon for the long ride home along those rutted tracks that Missourians called roads , across a landscape that resembled a rug pushed into a corner : rumpled , wrinkled , rippled with ravines and dusted with timber . His route would have carried him through the town of Liberty , the prosperous but modest county seat , and a dozen miles farther into the northern reaches of Clay . There he would have ridden over a low rise and caught sight of a humble three-room house with a narrow porch stretching across its single story , perched with a barn and a few outbuildings above a deep streambed . It was home.13 // James had clearly given careful thought to the timing of the extended trip he had just completed . The month of January , though the deepest trough of winter , overflowed with labor for the typical Missouri farmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily lightened . The river , too , would finally be free of ice , as the first paddlewheelers puffed into the landings along Clay County 's long waterfront . After selling his annual harvest of hemp , he would have had several weeks free before new seed had to go into the ground . So church member Jane W. Gill expressed little surprise when she noted in a letter that " Preacher James " had departed in late March to visit his native Kentucky.14 // But there was something odd about that journey . He apparently went alone , leaving behind his wife of five years , Zerelda Cole James , and their two-year-old son . Robert looked uncertain and uneasy when he left , a condition that his neighbors kept in mind as they welcomed him home . " Preacher James , " Gill wrote on June 15 , 1846 , " was here with his wife a few days after his return , and seems better contented to live in Mo . " 15 // Better contented . These modest words suggest a disquiet not quite dispelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any measure , he had already come far from his humble beginnings . Born on July 7 , 1818 , he became an orphan at the age of nine and went to live with his sister Mary Mimms ( eighteen years old and already married ) . In 1838 , he enrolled at Georgetown College , Kentucky , a rare distinction at a time when primary education was haphazard , secondary education rare , and illiteracy all too common . There he met Zerelda E. Cole , a strikingly tall girl who attended a Roman Catholic school in town . And she was indeed a girl . Born on January 29 , 1825 , she was only sixteen when she engaged to marry the devout college student.16 // Zerelda , too , was a native of Kentucky , and she , too , had lost a parent at an early age . Her father had died when she was just two , and she was left by her mother with her grandfather , Robert Cole . After he died , her mother married Robert Thomason-reportedly ignoring Zerelda 's disapproval-and moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl found herself packed off to live with relatives , this time with her uncle James M. Lindsay in Scott County , Kentucky . Though a Protestant , she entered the Catholic school in Georgetown , the community where she met her future husband . On December 20 , 1841 , they said their vows at Lindsay 's home . The wedding of such a young girl was not an ordinary event in antebellum Kentucky : Lindsay had to give county officials his written permission for the minor to marry . Once Robert James received his diploma , in the spring of 1842 , the pair packed their things and traveled to Clay County , where they moved in with Zerelda 's mother and Thomason . The child bride soon showed signs of pregnancy . Nine days before her eighteenth birthday , on January 10 , 1843 , she delivered a boy . They named him Alexander Franklin James , or Frank , for short.17 // All in all , Robert James found himself in a seemingly blissful domestic setting , with a young , attractive wife and a newborn son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short order , he found a forum for his ambition at the New Hope Baptist Church . Founded in 1828 , it was a humble affair : a log structure twenty feet square , with a haphazard stone chimney that opened into a gaping fireplace . Even in this cramped space , worshippers had plenty of room during Sunday meetings . Their recently departed preacher had driven away most members with heated doctrinal disputes over communion . When James first arrived , a mere fifteen people gathered for services.18 // In that dim , gritty church , James discovered his own inner light ; and in him , the tiny church found its salvation , in both the spiritual and the worldly sense . Baptist congregations ordained their own preachers from among their membership ; nothing more was required than a mutual agreement that a man had received a divine calling to speak the word of God . And the pious , charismatic , well-educated young fellow from Kentucky inspired immediate consensus among these " very plain " people . One neighbor recalled how he had attended the ordination service @ @ @ @
