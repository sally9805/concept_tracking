" Her publisher swears that she was born in a horse-drawn carriage at the corner of Chicago 's Michigan Avenue and 12th Street . " If all unhappy families are unhappy in their own fashion , then the lack of parental role models in Georgiana Craig 's family set them apart . To understand Georgiana 's demons ( and canon ) , one must understand her family as well . The impact is obvious . While the debate of nature vs. nurture in the development of personality continues , young Georgiana 's family history most definitely played a part in her later writing . Georgiana 's mother , Mary Walker Randolph , had been born into a doctor 's family in 1882 . Her own mother , Mary Aglae Keen Randolph , died of typhoid just a month after the birth of her second child ( also named Mary ) . Doctor and Mrs. Robert Innes Randolph lived in Manhattan , where Randolph had a successful medical practice as a general practitioner .

Randolph , born in 1852 in Washington , D.C. , was descended from the Virginia Randolphs ( from which Thomas Jefferson hailed ) . Fifty years after his death , Georgiana 's mother still fondly remembered stories that her father had told about his efforts for the South in the Civil War , alongside three of his four brothers . Randolph 's part in the war could have only been minimal due to his young age , but the family maintained a sense of history through the stories . Theirgrandmother , yet another Mary , had considerable financial means , and raised Mary Randolph and her older sister , Ethel . Dr. Randolph moved his practice to Chicago after a period of time , and continued to treat patients there until 1889 , when at the age of thirty-seven he died of a heart attack . Mary Randolph was only seven at the time of his death . By all accounts , Mary never missed her parents or showed emotion regarding their early passing . She took well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give birth to one of the funniest crime novelists of the twentieth century considered herself a serious artist . At the tender age of sixteen , Mary Randolph enrolled in the Art Institute of Chicago . The Art Institute ( which resides with the Chicago Art Museum ) offered a single course of study while allowing for areas of artistic concentration , ensuring that each student became well versed in all areas of the arts . While studying sculpting at the institute , Randolph met another young artist , Harry Moshiem Craig . Throughout 1897 and 1898 , the pair studied the classical arts curriculum of the school . Craig ( whom Randolph nicknamed Bosco for an unknown reason ) was studying to be a painter . With his dark curly hair and boyish face , Craig appeared the likable rogue who did n't take life too seriously . Randolph was striking even as a young woman , with beautiful cheekbones and a slender , striking figure . She became a favorite subject of Craig 's . The pair hit it off immediately , and were known to court off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig dropped out of the Institute , most likely for lack of funds . His departure turned Randolph 's romantic attention in other directions . A few months later , at the age of eighteen Mary married Joseph Davoll . Little is known of Randolph 's first husband beyond his name . The marriage was not a success and ended in divorce in less than a year , a shocking occurrence at the turn of the century in polite society . It is known that Randolph left school to become the dutiful housewife , which most likely did n't sit well with the well-to-do artist . The couple did n't remain in contact after the split . Randolph was not the kind of woman who looked back after making decisions . She rarely spoke of him again . Randolph soon re-enrolled in the Art Institute , having missed the artistic outlet and the association with people of similar interests . The domestic demands of nineteenth century matrimony were not for her . Randolph found a second home at the Institute when she returned . She also resumed seeing Bosco Craig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited a substantial sum from the wealthy grandmother who had raised her , and so the Craigs decided to travel Europe to practice their respective arts . Young , in love , and well-to-do-what better combination for open-ended travel ? They made no plans to return to the States when they took off . The Craigs ' itinerary included the great art capitals of Europe , including London , Paris and Munich . Van Gogh , Gauguin , and Cezanne all lived in Paris , and the pull of the artistic capital drew in the Craigs . The art world had changed dramatically in the decade before the Craigs ' descent on Europe . Picasso left behind the work of his " Blue Period " to start painting what would later be called Cubism . Chagall and others transformed the art world , heralding the age of modern art . Europe offered more than could be hoped for in the Midwest , even Chicago . Mary Craig basked in the creative genius of Europe . Living amongst these artists encouraged her to strive to better her work and be more critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , though she often destroyed a work that she did n't like . Working with clay and granite made her relatively stationary , as it was nearly impossible to lug the oversized art around the world . Bosco Craig 's painting supplies were much more mobile . Hence , Mary Craig trashed many of the less-than-stellar works for ease of travel . After two years of studying art in Europe , Mary Craig found herself pregnant , and returned to Chicago in early 1908 to have her first child . She traveled alone . Bosco Craig remained in Europe , painting and enjoying life . He trusted that the independent Mrs. Craig would be fine on a long ship journey home while pregnant . Though no correspondence exists between the couple , solitary travel was not a good sign for the relationship . The serious Mary Craig and carefree Bosco Craig were not well suited for living together . Mary Craig had n't yet forsaken her family duties , though . She divided her time between her sister and Craig 's mother in Fort Atkinson , Wisconsin . Georgiana Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke 's Hospital in Chicago . Contrary to her daughter 's publicist 's later stories of birth in a horse-drawn carriage and a mother unwilling to leave the Art Institute , Mary Craig made it to the hospital for the birth of her daughter . Hospitals were still a luxury for childbirth at the turn of the century , but Craig expected and received the very best in medical care . Georgiana Craig 's story only underscores the rift between the generations , and the hard feelings over Mary Craig having put her career before her first-born child . Wanting to rejoin her new husband in Europe as soon as possible , Mary Craig returned to the continent as soon as she medically could . Alone . She left the baby with Bosco Craig 's mother , Mary Church Young Craig , in Fort Atkinson . A baby would slow her progress and interfere with the couple 's travel and pursuit of the arts . Having no parents of her own , the new mother seemed unconcerned about the maternal role in childrearing . After all , she had been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been raised in a household of women , Mary Craig had wanted a boy , a male heir . The reasons for this are not clear , but interviews with her make the preference for men apparent . Her quick departure from Chicago underscored this disappointment in little Georgiana 's gender . Like many traditional families of the day , Bosco Craig 's mother did n't live alone . Also living at her home in Fort Atkinson were Craig 's half-sister and her husband , Nan and Elton Rice . Bosco Craig had been the only child of Mary Church Young Craig 's second marriage ( to Samuel Craig ) ; however , her previous marriage to James Young had produced three daughters : Mary Eloise Young , known as Mame ; Nancy Church Young , known as Nan ; and Jessica Young , called Jesse . Although Bosco Craig 's half-sisters were a generation older than he was , all three remained close to home and watched him as he grew up . The sisters spoiled their younger brother terribly , being more like aunts than sisters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceive a child of their own , and started raising their half-niece as the daughter they could n't have . In their forties , the pair had given up hope of having a child . The couple poured out their love on this pseudo-orphan , quickly spoiling her . Nan Rice was a small , slight woman who had been called Chip by her father because of her diminutive stature . She and Elton Rice made an unusual couple for their day-extremely well-educated and independent-minded . Nan Rice had been a Montessori-type schoolteacher long before women worked prior to marriage , and Elton Rice had retired from the white-collar world of banking . In addition , Nan Rice was an ardent feminist , teaching Georgiana that she could be anything a man could be . Mrs. Rice marched as a suffragette and followed politics closely . The couple were also devout Democrats , who kept a picture of FDR enshrined in the living room during the 1930s . They did n't participate in organized religion , which made them even more unique in the small town of Fort Atkinson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her birth . Quite an unusual set of circumstances for the first years of the century . Despite some difficulties in caring for a newborn without the birth mother , Nan and Elton Rice adapted well to the situation . Mary and Bosco Craig would not visit Georgiana until she turned three . When the Craigs returned to the U.S. in 1911 , they reclaimed their daughter on a quick trip to Fort Atkinson and moved to Chicago , where they continued to pursue their interests in painting and sculpture . Mary Craig enrolled once more at the Art Institute , to apply some of the techniques she had learned in Europe . While legally the birth parents could take their child wherever they chose , uprooting the three-year old from the only home she knew had a tremendous psychological impact on Georgiana . The loss of security and sense of home traumatized her in an emotional upheaval akin to losing one 's parents . Even as an adult , she would mention the abandonment , and it was the major theme in her fiction . She did n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nan and Elton Rice were heart-broken over the loss of the child they now considered their own . Despite this domestic instability , Georgiana remained a precocious child and learned to read by the age of four . The little girl questioned everything , and possessed a vivid imagination . She was a bookish child , hampered by a number of allergies and illnesses . Photos taken at the tine show a thin and gangly Georgiana with thick dark hair like her father , and chubby cheeks that dimpled when she smiled . Living in Chicago did n't suit Georgiana 's parents , either . After three years in the United States , they decided to return to Europe to paint and sculpt-again without their daughter . They left Georgiana with the Rices for a second time . They assumed that the couple would be willing to take the child back on the same terms as before : raise her until we want her back . By age six , in effect , Georgiana had been orphaned three times , and in the process left with absolutely no sense of belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she returned to them , afraid of losing them again . Despite an inquisitive nature that presumed a certain independence , Georgiana was extremely needy emotionally , and demanded a great deal of attention from the Rices . As an only child , she was able to receive most of the family 's focus . Nan and Elton Rice were happy to take back Georgiana . Shortly after , the Rices left retirement for a more bucolic existence . They moved to Washington state ( near the Canadian border ) to run a commercial apple orchard . Records do not make clear whether the Rices owned or merely tenanted the farm , but they were responsible for the crop of apples grown there . The couple dabbled in horticultural science as they farmed . The farm life agreed with Georgiana ; she was a sickly child who needed a great deal of medical attention . She had contracted a number of respiratory infections . The girl had suffered from a number of allergies to foods including strawberries , which made her break out in hives . The quiet atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rices without outside influences . Mary and Bosco Craig 's timing for leaving America could n't have been worse . They arrived in Europe in early 1914 . Secret alliances conceived by the heads of state in Europe , and the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand , began a chain of events that led to the outbreak of fighting in the Balkans , quickly engulfing the continent . When war broke out in Europe in August , 1914 , the Craigs hurriedly decided to move to Bombay , India . They had spent just a few months on the continent that had afforded them so much pleasure before the start of World War I and a forever-changed Europe . In Asia , they continued their artistic pursuits , but the challenge of their life , along with the lack of artistic outlets , took a toll on the couple . In 1918 , Mary Craig returned to the United States when she became pregnant for a second time . A deadly flu epidemic had swept the Far East , killing millions of people globally . Craig wanted to be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , traveling with Bosco Craig had lost its appeal , and she started making plans to remain in the United States after the birth of her second child . Bosco Craig decided to stay in the Far East , and continued to travel extensively in the Orient . Without his wife 's money , the charming rogue had to make a living on his own . In order to support the lifestyle Mary Craig had provided , he gave up his painting career to become a land broker . He had never been very serious about his art . Mary Craig considered herself a sculptress above all else , including mother . Later in life , she reflected that Bosco Craig could have been a good painter if he had bothered to apply himself , but no one can really verify that assumption . The only known remaining work by Craig is a striking portrait of his wife , presently held by Craig 's son-in-law , Howard Metcalfe . Mary and Bosco Craig 's son , Christopher , was born in February of 1919 . Without seeing each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Georgiana was almost eleven and had little memory of her birth parents . Her life was with the Rices , who took care of her scraped knees and colds . However , on her way to live in Santa Fe , Mary Craig stopped in Washington to retrieve her daughter . With the birth of her second child , the long-awaited son , Craig had decided to settle down and raise both children by herself . Whatever reception she was expecting , it certainly was n't the outburst that young Georgiana provided . " Go to hell , " she told her mother . While few stories of Georgiana Craig 's youth remain , the family was clear that she adamantly refused to move again . Georgiana 's decision to stay was the opening salvo in what would be a lifelong battle between mother and daughter , played out over decades , across continents , and in the news media . Georgiana had been raised to think independently , and the child harbored extreme bitterness over being left by her birth parents . Raising her voice and cursing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the exception of the few years in Chicago , Nan and Elton Rice had raised Georgiana from a few days old . She gave her undivided love to these people , not the Craigs . Mary Craig left the farm with only baby Christopher . Scorned , she took her daughter 's words seriously and did n't maintain maternal relations with the girl after that fight . Even in later years , she barely acknowledged the fact that she 'd had a first-born daughter . Mary Craig did n't forgive Georgiana for choosing to remain with her half-aunt and uncle , and took a malicious pleasure in spurning her in public at every opportunity . Georgiana , however , tried to forge a relationship with Craig despite wanting to remain with the Rices . She referred to Nan and Elton Rice as her foster-parents , and still called Mary " Mother . " Craig , in return , rejected her daughter when she could , to punish her for choosing the Rices over her . On one occasion , she embarrassed Georgiana by turning away from a kiss in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking about her sons , and not " that girl " as she referred to Georgiana . Even when she was interviewed for Time in 1946 , Craig was still hostile about the rejection , referring to her daughter as " George , " and saying that she did n't have time to read her daughter 's books . After this episode with Mary Craig , Nan and Elton Rice formalized their relationship with Georgiana by adopting her in 1921 . Mary signed the paperwork approving the adoption , and the girl was now officially named Georgiana Craig Rice , called Anna by her adoptive parents . One more name for the child . They continued to live on the small farm , in the Okanogan Valley in Washington State , only a few miles south of the Canadian border . Nan Rice taught herself to graft the apple trees , and experimented with the orchard while raising Anna . The family enjoyed a quiet , bucolic existence . The small town did n't offer a lot in the way of social activities , and kept the family close to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional needs . Without the distractions , Georgiana was able to grasp a number of subjects and receive the attention and love she needed . Living in Washington , Georgiana was taught mainly by private tutors who emphasized history , music , and languages . Her sharp intelligence and artistic nature began to show . By the time she reached twelve , Georgiana had a rough knowledge of Latin and Greek . There seemed to be no end to her range of interests or her ability to pick up a subject quickly if she was interested . Attempts at a more formal education did n't work as well . Georgiana 's neediness and desire to cling to Nan and Elton Rice made separation nearly impossible . She wanted to stay at home at all costs . On several occasions , when Georgiana was sent to a boarding school , she ran away or behaved so badly that she was returned home-the end result she desired . Georgiana Rice could n't stand to be away from her loved ones , not even for short periods of time . Until almost the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion to Georgiana . She was happiest as a child in the company of Nan and Elton Rice , and while creating . Georgiana began writing poetry when she was nine years old . When she was only ten , one of her poems won a contest for a Chicago newspaper . Even these poems show a twinkle of the humor and wit that she would use in later years-a play on words , an image to make the reader smile . It 's very hard to think of The way men do these days ; The way they try to kill each other In ten thousand different ways . I do n't think God intended That His children all should fight And have to keep sentries on guard Whether its sic day or night . The kaiser wants to rule the world I think he is a pig ; Or else he 's made of sausages , And they are awfully big . Nan and Elton Rice exhibited no gifts for the creative arts , but they encouraged their daughter at every opportunity , trying to mold her artistic nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound into small books with pictures to accompany the verse . Georgiana also studied piano , and in those early years hoped to train as a concert pianist . The Rices helped by providing her with lessons and sheet music . Georgiana 's real mother continued to pursue her own creative arts . When she left Georgiana with the Rices , Mary Craig moved to the Chama Valley ( about one hundred miles from Santa Fe ) . She soon met an artist in New Mexico who went by the name Sacha Finklestein . With his penchant for stories and confusing names , the man could have easily posed as Georgiana 's father . A Russian by birth , Alexander Illytch Patraeff , he was said to have been in turn a count and a prince in Bessarabia ; however , the number of Finklesteins in the royal court was slim . More likely the ethnic surname marked him as being of Jewish heritage , and thus targeted for a pogrom . Many Russian refugees claimed a noble heritage , since the Communists had destroyed any records that might refute such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royals . Finklestein left the country at the onset of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1919 and moved to Paris , where he studied art . Many of the so-called White Russians , the elite of the czarist society , fled the country at this time and sought shelter elsewhere . After a short stay in Western Europe , Finklestein immigrated to the United States . Finklestein arrived in Santa Fe at the same time as Mary Craig . Like Bosco Craig , he painted and exhibited his work , under the name of F.I . Sacha . Mary Craig enjoyed the time at the artists ' community in New Mexico , as she put on two exhibitions of her own sculptures . She felt fulfilled in the company of others artists , as she had been at the Institute and in Europe . Again , she began courting an artist . Finklestein and Mary Craig married in or about 1922 . Because of his dislike of his own surname at that time , Finklestein adopted the surname Randolph , Mary 's maiden name . Mary Walker Randolph Davoll Craig Finklestein became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's adoption added to the confusion regarding Georgiana 's real name . The stories surrounding her name became almost as convoluted as a Craig Rice plot . Critical works in later years would assume that Rice 's maiden name was the same as her mother 's married name ; hence , almost all of the articles about the mystery writer would label her Georgiana Randolph or even Georgiana Walker Randolph . She found this confusion amusing and did n't bother to correct misunderstandings . Instead , she fueled them . Private jokes amused her most , especially when they resulted in public confusion . Later , Rice would add to the doubts by giving out variations of her real name , delighting in fooling people . By the 1980s the subject was so murky that researchers confidently stated that no indication remained of how the author had selected the pseudonym " Craig Rice . " They labeled her penname a mystery . How ironic that in fact it was her full , adopted name . Shortly after the Randolph 's wedding , the couple and Christopher set off for Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1924 , Mary Randolph gave birth to a third child , another son , named Alexander after his father . The growing family bought a home overlooking the Grand Canal in Venice , where Christopher and Alexander were raised . Georgiana Rice had little contact with her birth family at this point . She did n't know of the birth of her second brother until much later in life . About the same time , the Rices sold the commercial orchard and decided to travel . Georgiana Rice had graduated from Oroville High School in May 1924 , and soon the family migrated south to move in with Nan Rice 's sister , Mame Young , in San Diego . Young was much older than her sister , and large compared to the diminutive Nan Rice . She had been a schoolteacher , and had moved to La Jolla many years prior . Her efforts on behalf of young Georgiana Rice were needed . Attempts to educate the Rices ' daughter were proving futile . Georgiana had grown into a very headstrong young woman , bright and lively , charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elton Rice doted on her , not reproaching her behavior , which did n't help the situation . While living with Mame Young , Georgiana Rice attended the State Teacher 's College ( later San Diego State University ) , majoring in letters and science . The Rices and Mame Young all encouraged Georgiana in her studies . By this time , she was showing traces of being the funny young woman remembered by her schoolmates as the class clown . She made more of an impression on the boys in her class with her glamorous looks . Georgiana was still the slender young woman with dark hair of earlier photos , but her cheeks had thinned out , leaving her with the beautiful bone structure of her mother . The attractive brunette wore her hair short to keep the curls under control . She was quite a beauty . By the mid-1920s , Rice enjoyed the looser , less studious mentality of the flappers on campus , not bothering to spend time on her class work . The post-war years had allowed women a bit more freedom in their actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , Rice became a cut-up in class . Schoolrooms became a theater for her antics . Rice only lasted a year at the school , mostly because of her failing grades . Not a surprise for a woman who was more interested in entertaining than matriculating . She had tasted the fruits of what her quick wit could get her-unlimited attention and laughter . Grades were secondary at that point . Ironically , Rice received her worst grades in the subjects directly relating to her natural parents : History of Modern Europe and Art Structure . Although Georgiana Rice did n't fare well in her studies , she blossomed in her creative efforts . She tried any number of the arts before settling down to one . Unsure of her own talents and interests , Rice attempted several artistic endeavors before she discovered her passion for writing . Although she tickled the ivories informally at the parties she was learning to love , Rice had given up hope of becoming a concert pianist . She joined The State College Players at State Teacher 's College and participated in the dramas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in a performance for a local school , acting the part of beauty in The Prince who Learned Everything out of Books . Finally , Rice worked for a reform newspaper while she was in college , earning a salary of $6 a week . She found that she enjoyed the daily change of work brought on by the news and the excitement of unfolding events , re-creating the scenes for her readers . " I unwittingly uncovered the wrong scandal , got fired , took the scandalous information to a rival paper , got hired at twice the salary , " she told Fred Dannay years later . By the time she left , Rice worked as a police reporter for the newspaper at the wage of $22.50 . These days of crime , courts , and lawyers made a big impression on her , and she remembered them often in her letters and essays . She regaled friends with the story of this trial or another , using the court cases , which seemed to be burned into her mind as well as the court record . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any other creative art , and applied herself solely to writing . After watching their daughter 's disastrous freshman year at State Teacher 's College , Nan and Elton Rice chose to return to Fort Atkinson . Georgiana Rice followed them to start her career as a journalist .
