<p> Han Wenzhen lives alone in a one-room apartment with no heat , no hot water and no indoor bathroom . A separate kitchen , shared by three families , is hard to reach using her crutches . <p> But this is home , and the 75-year-old retired textile worker ca n't imagine living here without frequent visits from her neighbor . He Min , also 75 , has no physical ailments and plenty of time on her hands . She delights in bringing Han extra food from her own table and juicy gossip from the outside world . <p> What appears to be an ordinary arrangement between two grandmothers , however , is a potentially groundbreaking program for a country facing the monumental task of caring for the world 's largest elderly population . <p> Han and He are participants in an unusual experiment in Shanghai called Time Bank . It is the first program in China to use able-bodied retirees to help other elderly people in need and to do it without relying on government money , expensive nursing homes or the children of those it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hours spent helping others are logged in a book and monitored by the government 's neighborhood committees . Those hours can be exchanged , one for one , for the labor of a new generation of helpers when the current caregivers are in need . <p> " This old couple 's today is my tomorrow , " said Xue Xiuzhen , 61 , who recently started working with Bao Linzhen and her husband , both 84 . She also cares for her own 90-year-old mother . " If we do n't care about them now , we do n't care about our own future . " <p> Shanghai is eager to make the program work because this city is graying faster than any other in China . About 2.4 million people here are older than 60 . That 's 18 percent of the city 's population , compared with the national average of 10 percent , according to the Institute of Population and Development Studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences . <p> On average , people in Shanghai live six years longer than those elsewhere in China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of living . The life expectancy here , at 75 years , is one year shy of the U.S. average . In 2030 , Shanghai 's elderly population is expected to soar to 4.6 million . By then , China as a whole will have an estimated 275 million elderly people  --  more than the current total U.S. population . <p> " The society 's burden is getting heavier and heavier , " said the population institute 's director , Sun Changmin . " The Time Bank concept is very unusual and has the potential to be a breakthrough idea in this country . " <p> In the United States , similar volunteer projects have operated at various times in Florida , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Illinois , New York , Delaware and Michigan . <p> The efforts have been experimental , and none has involved a large share of the local elderly population . The initial participants have been enthusiastic , but organizers say it is difficult to find enough people willing to join the program and stay in it long enough to make the services available on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirees . Zhang Landi , at 46 one of the youngest Time Bank helpers , was laid off from her factory job last year . Her daughter is away at college , and her husband is a sailor who touches land only a few times a year . Aiding 85-year-old Wang Shouxing is a way for Zhang to keep busy and feel useful . <p> " I saw that she is always by herself . I wondered if she gets bored and lonely , so I volunteered to sit with her and talk to her about her health or nutrition needs , " Zhang said . " When I am 70 or 80 , I 'm sure someone else will come help me . " <p> Traditionally , China 's young cared for its old . But the country 's strictly enforced one-child policy reduced the size of the typical Chinese family and shrank the ranks of those able to care for the elderly . <p> In addition , while work units provided cradle-to-cremation protection for Chinese laborers before the beginning of market reforms in the late 1970s , overburdened state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employees fired before their prime survive on meager allowances as they seek new jobs . Older retirees sometimes must wait years before getting reimbursed for medical expenses . A new universal social security system has yet to take shape . <p> Meanwhile , people like Han are grateful to collect what they can from their former jobs . She gets the equivalent of about $ 70 a month  --  not enough to pay for a nursing home , which costs about $ 115 a month . Even if they can afford it , most elderly shy away from such facilities because of the shameful implication that their children have abandoned them . <p> Han does n't like to admit it , but it would be nice if her 51-year-old daughter could visit more often . At the very least she could then help Han wash her hair , which requires heating a big pot of water , carrying it to a plastic wash basin and mixing it with cold water from the faucet . Even with help , the grandmother can tolerate the difficult task only once a month . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-in-law can spare the time to cut it . <p> " Big families must break into smaller families ; you have to change with the times , " said Han , stressing that she is a longtime Communist Party member and can tough out anything . <p> In many ways , her helper , He , is her new family . The straight-shooting former nurse with a booming voice often comes knocking at 6 a.m. and spends an average of four hours a day with the soft-spoken Han . While Han can warm up her own breakfast of powdered milk and leftover rice in the microwave her daughter bought her , she counts on He to empty her bedpan , read the newspaper aloud and go to the post office once a month for her retirement money . The rest of their time together , the two enjoy sewing bedroom slippers to give away as gifts . <p> " It makes me happy to help . It enriches my life . If I sit there and do nothing , I would be wasting my life anyway , " said He , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , which easily could top 1,000 for the last year . She also brushes aside the suggestion that someone else might not be able to return the favor with the same gusto . <p> " When I get old , " the 75-year-old He said , " I hope I die suddenly . I do n't need anybody 's help . " <p> The growing number of people drawn to Time Bank are interested not just in giving but also in receiving . So the program needs to provide all participants with an adequate sense of security , the population institute 's Sun said . <p> " The potential volunteers will want to know : What if I move ? What if my children move ? There is no legal certainty I 'll get my time back , " Sun said . <p> Organizers stress that the program is only a supplement to the country 's overall social security system , which is in need of revamping . Until then , they count on the government to expand Time Bank 's reach , so volunteers who move can tap into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working to formalize the contract with the volunteers rather than continue to rely on handwritten pieces of paper . <p> " But the fact that people are responding to the program is very interesting , " Sun said . " Whether it will continue to expand depends on how the government is willing to support and protect this new idea . "
