Ambassador Pete Peterson and his wife , Vietnamese emigre Vi Le , forge new ties with an old foe in Hanoi Photograph " People still stop us on the street to congratulate us , " says Peterson ( with Vi in the U.S. ambassador 's official residence in Hanoi ) . // At a 1997 dinner hosted by the Israeli ambassador to Hanoi , two of the guests felt an attraction utterly unrelated to the demands of diplomacy . They stayed by each other 's side all that evening and were married the following year-an unremarkable though delightful scenario but for the identities of the couple involved . He is Douglas " Pete " Peterson , 64 , a former Vietnam POW who in 1997 became the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam since the fall of Saigon 25 years ago . And she is Vi Le Peterson , 43 , a Vietnam native who left her homeland before she was a year old and lived in Laos , Thailand and Australia before returning to Vietnam in 1993 as an international banker . Together , they are one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the resonances of their marriage go far beyond the walls of the beautifully restored four-story French villa that serves as the ambassador 's residence . " It has been poetry that the two of them are together , " says Virginia Foote , president of the U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council . " Pete 's experience in Vietnam initially was among the worst in his life , and now he has found something quite wonderful there . " The couple 's surprise courtship thrilled their friends and captured the imagination of the Vietnamese people . Whether hosting diplomatic soirees or visiting rural villages to forge ties with the Communist government , the Petersons have become a popular team . " The two of us are sort of the epitome of the renewal of the international relationship , " says Peterson . " It helps give people a new look at what 's happening in Vietnam . " Neither Peterson nor Vi expected to find love after their different paths led them back to Vietnam . Though Vi 's merchant father , Vinh Mau Le , and her mother , Frances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1954 , when the Communists defeated the French in the colonial war that preceded the Vietnam War . Three years later the family moved to Vientiane , Laos , and later to Bangkok , where they established a chain of bakeries . In 1977 they settled in Australia , where Vi 's parents retired . Vi , by all accounts , inherited her parents ' drive . " She was a very high achiever , " says her younger sister Natalie , a pharmacist in Melbourne . ( Vi also has two older siblings , sister Christine and brother Khai . ) " She got into Melbourne University , which is very competitive . " After earning her bachelor 's degree in economics in 1981 and a graduate diploma in corporate finance three years later , Vi joined the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group . In 1993 she returned to Vietnam to set up the bank 's operations there , and three years later the Australian government appointed her its trade representative to Vietnam . Peterson 's upbringing was more prosaic . The ninth of ten children of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family first to Missouri and then on to Iowa . In 1954 he dropped out of Iowa Wesleyan College to join the Air Force , completing his degree in the service many years later . In 1956 , Peterson met and married flight dispatcher Carlotta Neal , mother of their son Michael , now 42 , and daughter Paula , 41 . In 1966 , Carlotta was eight months pregnant with their son Douglas when Peterson , by then a jet pilot , was sent to Vietnam . He had racked up 66 bombing missions when , on Sept. 10 , 1966 , his F-4 Phantom was shot down over North Vietnam . He spent the next of years in Hoa Lo prison , known as the Hanoi Hilton , where Sen. John McCain was also held for a time . There Peterson was subjected to frequent interrogation and torture . Freed in 1973 , he has shown an extraordinary ability to put the past behind him and rarely speaks of his imprisonment . " Being a POW is not my thing , " he said in 1997 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph " My faith tells me we all have a mission , said Peterson ( in the Air Force in 1963 ) . // But fate was not finished with him . In 1983 , two years after the family had moved to Tampa , where Peterson ran a construction business , Douglas , the son he had n't seen until the boy was 7 , was killed in a car crash . Then , in 1995 , five years after Peterson was elected to Congress from Florida , Carlotta died of breast cancer . The loss of his son , says Peterson , " virtually paralyzed me . " And his wife 's death , he says , " caused a similar sense of despair and emptiness . " When offered the ambassadorship two years later , he saw it as a chance to mend himself-and help two nations heal as well . " I think maybe I can be the bridge , " he said of the job in ' ' 97 , " the catalyst to make reconciliation work . " Photograph Peterson ( with son Mike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' 97. // Making the relationship with Vi work was far easier . When they met at the Israeli ambassador 's , there was no doubting the magnetism . " It was a buffet , and we made sure we sat together , " she says . " It felt so natural . There were no problems that you have in other relationships . We felt that , yes , this was the way it was meant to be . " A month later the pair began dating . They have been virtually inseparable ever since . In May 1998 , after negotiating a mile or two of the governmental red tape that foreigners marrying in Vietnam must untangle , the Roman Catholic couple were wed in Hanoi 's St. Joseph 's Cathedral . While a cadre of international press swarmed outside , some 700 guests sweltered in 104-degree heat inside . The groom 's coat was soaked . " Even the candles melted , " he recalls . Still , says Peterson 's son Mike , a manager for an aviation support-services firm who flew over from Florida to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful event . Vi 's a ball of fire , and it 's nice to see him have a life again . " That life is a full one . Peterson spends his days at the embassy , and Vi , who became a U.S. citizen in February , runs her own consulting business for companies planning to set up shop in Vietnam . When Peterson visits a village or attends a school or hospital dedication without his wife at his side , the disappointment is palpable . " They make a formidable team , " says Andrew Steer , director of the World Bank 's operations in Vietnam . " At a dinner , you 'll see Vi speaking on behalf of the private sector and Pete on behalf of the diplomatic sector , making complementary points . " When they have time , the couple love to stroll through Hanoi 's colorful Old Quarter . Sometimes they explore the city on motorbikes , setting an example by wearing helmets , symbolizing the public-safety campaign that is one of their pet projects . In Vietnam , Peterson points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 will die this year due to preventable accidents-drowning , electrocution and road mishaps . " It 's just appalling , " he says . Both Petersons think themselves fortunate that they met and fell in love in Vietnam . " Coming back here was renewing my roots , " says Vi , who has met several relatives for the first time . For Peterson , the passage may be even more poignant . A week after he became engaged to Vi , a friend who knew of his years as a POW and about the deaths of his son and wife told him , " Pete , you 're a lucky man . " Peterson paused a moment and said , " Yes , nowadays that 's true . Today I can say that . " J.D.
