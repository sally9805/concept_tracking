A Kiss in the Dark Chapter One London , 1819 " Blast the girl ! " Tristan Knight , the fifth Earl of Ellington , raked his fingers back through his hair and began to pace the area in front of the fireplace , his movements agitated . " I tell you , Archer , if I can not rein in Emily 's antics , and soon , I shall be a suitable candidate for Bedlam ! " Standing just outside the circle of firelight , the elderly butler shook his head , his rheumy blue eyes full of concern . " She is young yet , my lord , and she has had little guidance in the past several years . I 'm afraid your father allowed her to run a bit wild . " " I am well aware of what my father allowed . " Tristan came to an abrupt halt , his hands going to his hips as he pivoted to face his servant . " The man wrought a bloody mess with his ambivalence and neglect and has left it to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could say in reply , Archer remained silent . Tristan 's brow lowered as his gaze traveled about the study , taking in its masculine dcor . On the surface , nothing much seemed to have changed in the eight years he 'd been gone . The massive mahogany furniture was as grand and imposing as ever , the vast collection of books lining the shelves as awe-inspiring . Only an extremely discerning eye would have noticed the fraying edges of the Axminster carpet or the faded hue of the heavy brocade draperies hanging at the windows . " His lordship was never the same after your mother 's death , " Archer finally spoke again , shifting the weight of his spare frame from one foot to the other . " I 'm afraid he spent most of his evenings at his club and in the gambling halls , and when he did come home , he was usually a trifle too ... inebriated to attend to any of the household affairs . " The mention of the late countess made Tristan 's heart squeeze painfully in his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank into an armchair close to the hearth , reaching up to rub wearily at his temples . " I know . And I apologize for snapping at you , Archer . None of this is your fault . I 'm afraid I let my temper get the better of me . Again . " " I understand , my lord . The Lady Emily can be a bit trying at times . " That was putting it mildly . " How many governesses is it now ? Three ? Four ? " " Five at last count , I believe . " Five in less than four months ! Bloody hell , was his sister intent on going through every available governess in London ? " To be fair , " Archer ventured , " the Mrs. Eversley incident was n't entirely Lady Emily 's fault . That cruet of vinegar did look rather amazingly like the woman 's flask of nightly restorative in the right light . " " I doubt Mrs. Eversleyw ould agree with that assessment , especiallyaft er swallowing a mouthful of vinegar . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes or the garter snake in Mrs. Petersham 's bedclothes . Why , if Mrs. Petersham had been a few years older , the poor woman might have had a fit of apoplexy . As it was , she was hysterical . " The butler 's lined face flushed a dull red . " Lady Emily is rather high-spirited , my lord , but as I 'm sure you can appreciate , the last few months have been quite an adjustment for her . What with his lordship 's death and then your arrival ... well , I 'm certain all she needs is some time to accept the changes in her life . " " I have given her time . I 've given her four months , but the situation seems to be getting worse instead of better , and I am fast running out of options , not to mention suitable governesses . Mrs. Petersham came very highly recommended , and this latest debacle of Emily 's has sent her packing in less than a week . " " Why , my lord , I d o believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last tutor in less than twenty-four hours . " Tristan could n't restrain the slight smile that curled the corners of his mouth at Archer 's words . It was true . He had been far from the model son and heir . In fact , after years of trying to please a father who could n't be pleased , he 'd rebelled rather shamefully . Tristan 's stare went to the large writing desk in the far corner of the room , and in his mind 's eye he could envision Sinclair Knight seated behind it , his expression stern as he once again lectured Tristan on the error of his rakehell ways . He and his father had never seen eye to eye on anything , and on many occasions it had only been the calming presence of Lady Ellington that had kept them from each other 's throats . As always , thoughts of his gentle mother sent a shaft of anguish piercing deep within him , and his smile instantly vanished . Images flashed across his vision . A man 's scarred face . The flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold stones of a dark alleyway . Unable to face the tormenting memories , Tristan forcefully pushed them away and glanced up at Archer . " Emily hates me , " he murmured aloud , " and I ca n't say that I blame her . I abandoned her , left her alone with a man who was so caught up in his own pain he could n't even take care of himself , much less a daughter . " The butler shuffled forward to lay a gnarled hand on his arm . " She does n't hate you , my lord . She simply is n't used to having someone in her life who cares what she does . " Pushing himself to his feet , Tristan strode over to the windows and pulled aside the curtain to look down on the street below . Dusk was just starting to fall over the stately town houses on Berkeley Square , and except for a lone lamplighter making his solitary rounds , all was peaceful and still ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
