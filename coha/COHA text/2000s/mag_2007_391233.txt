BECAUSE MIDWESTERNERS NEED A DEATH ZONE TOO , DO N'T YAH KNOW . It 's nearly dusk by the time the snowcat lurches to a stop atop Everest . The weather window has held all day  --  light winds , occasional flurries , and a steady barometer  --  but a mechanical issue kept us pinned down at Advance Base Camp until late this afternoon . This is my first time on Everest and the technical difficulties sent me into an emotional tailspin . I spent the bulk of my day fidgeting with gear , obsessing about the cat 's repair , and worrying about the weather . But that 's all behind us now . Cat-skiing in the Death Zone ! Unlike all the double amputees , geriatric Japanese dudes , and blind guys , I 'm going to log a real accomplishment , a true mechanical first . Sure , a few years ago a French guy " landed " a helicopter on the Roof of the World . But he did what 's called a " hover landing , " which means his rotors were continuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the summit . Puh-leeze , he did n't even drop a load of skiers . French whirlybirds do n't even compare to a snowcat full of rippers driving straight up the gut of the world 's largest snow-covered chunk of rock . It 's eerily calm at the top as we disgorge from the cat , but we know we 're in the right spot because a hand-painted sign nailed to a tree clearly reads EVEREST . The signage also features a cartoon drawing of a polar bear . Wait ... polar bears do n't live in the Himalayas . And what 's with that ocean-size lake in front of us , and the red-and-white radio tower behind us ? I 'm also not the slightest bit winded . Nor are any of my catmates  --  one of whom is casually smoking a Marlboro Light . Odd happenings indeed . But then , this Everest is a gently sloped ridge of hardwoods in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , and our snowcat departed from adjacent Porcupine Mountain Ski Area , known locally as the Porkies . OK , so this Everest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire seat-of-the-pants cat-skiing operation is the brainchild of Lonie Glieberman , the resort 's impish and perpetually disheveled owner , who , despite being just 39 , has already run three Canadian Football League teams into the ground . " So what ? " I ask you . Screw Kit DesLauriers and all those fancy-pants ski mountaineers . Bottled oxygen be damned . I intend to schralp Everest , ride the cat , and then schralp Everest some more . If you drive far enough north in Wisconsin , you end up in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula . This confuses most non-Midwesterners , who think of Michigan only as the oven mitt across from the Badger State , not above it . To further confuse things , Yoopers , from " U.P.-ers , " have more in common with Wisconsinites ( they 're Packer fans ) and Canadians ( whom they sound like ) than they do with " trolls , " the 97 percent of Michigan 's residents who live " under " ( or south of ) the Mackinac Bridge in the Lower Peninsula . Which is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional identity . The majority of residents are of Finnish descent . Old-timers wear Kromers , woolen Elmer Fudd-style baseball caps with pull-down earflaps . Pasties ( pronounced pass-tees , not pace-tees ) , the hearty , softball-size meat bombs filled with rutabaga , mystery meat , potatoes , and onions , are the home-cooked fast food of choice . And not what strippers put on their nipples . In wintertime , snowmobilers and ice fishermen outnumber skiers 20 to 1 around here , which is why I 'm not surprised to find the base lodge locked when I arrive at the resort at 9:30 in the morning . A few minutes later , the first customers of the day arrive when a beat-up minivan pulls up and unloads a skinny teenage boy in bright-red rear-entry ski boots . He trudges , half-asleep , across the parking lot carrying his ski poles and a Crock-Pot , the cord dragging in the dirty snow . A few minutes later , his mother walks up carrying a white insulated pot of coffee . The plan is to get going around 11 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been experiencing a low-snow year . It 's the middle of February , but there was n't enough coverage to re up the cat until last week . And the cat 's a beauty : a retro , royal-blue 18-seater with two fully articulated cabs , tan upholstery , and bench seats . " It 's a Swedish military something , " Lonie informed me earlier , " and supposedly amphibious . " After just a few hours of operation on opening day last Friday , the cat 's transmission blew , a fact that Lonie , like a not-so-crafty used-car salesman , tried to downplay on the phone when I called to make sure we were still on . Meanwhile Nathan Maki , the Porkies ' sensible and stocky 30-year-old mountain manager , furiously rebuilt the transmission with his dad . " It was a rush job , " he tells me , " We pulled it out on Tuesday , rebuilt it on Wednesday , and slapped it back in yesterday . " Today , the transmission is apparently running fine , Lonie tells me as he glad-hands around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Nathan and the mechanic are on the way to Everest , the driveshaft seizes up and busts . " The mechanic should be able to fix it in a few hours , " Nathan assures me , explaining how the front car 's tracks are running fine , but the rear car is n't getting any power . And then , perhaps sensing my mechanically disinclined nature , he adds , " Right now , the rear car is like a broken dick on a dog . Useless . " Got it . " Cat-skiing ... in the U.P. ? " Whenever I told friends what I was up to , the response was the same : mild disbelief and major amusement . Explaining the particulars grew wearisome rather quickly . But if you want to know how the Porkies , one of the Upper Midwest 's lesser-known resorts , became home to the world 's unlikeliest cat-skiing operation , all explanations start and end with Lonie Glieberman . With financial backing from his dad , Bernie , a real estate and construction mogul from Detroit , Lonie opened Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a bold move . Most of the ski areas in the economically depressed peninsula are struggling . But with no grooming , no snowmaking , and no beginner runs ( the resort 's de facto motto is NO BEGINNERS ALLOWED ) , Bohemia slowly carved out its own grassroots niche . Today , thanks to legitimately challenging terrain and a series of plucky marketing gimmicks , including dubbing moderately steep runs " triple black diamonds , " a three-year-long women-ski-free-every-day promotion , and a controversial Mardi Gras-inspired , **38;3373;TOOLONG spring break event , Bohemia is the region 's most buzzed-about resort . Lonie 's Mount Bohemia venture was also the first time the father-son partnership produced any positive business results , despite similar ploys with Mardi Gras beads . Beginning in 1991 , when Lonie was just 23 , he and his dad embarked on a string of short-lived and spectacularly unsuccessful attempts at owning and operating CFL football teams : the Ottawa Rough Riders ( 1991-93 ) , the Shreveport Pirates ( 94-95 ) , and then back to Ottawa with the Renegades ( 2005-06 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The results were always the same : the implosion of the franchise . A highlight reel of the Gliebermans ' miscalculations and blunders includes Lonie 's habitual courtship of cheerleaders , the recruitment of a linebacker with a nasty cocaine habit , and a comical attempt to hire Mike Ditka as coach . And beads for breasts  --  that 's been a constant . But unlike the football misadventures , Bohemia has been a hit , if not financially , since the resort did n't turn a profit last season , then with Midwestern expert skiers unsatisfied with the region 's flatter , groomed terrain . Buoyed by this approximation of success , in 2003 Lonie leased the Porkies , a struggling , state-owned resort 100 miles west of Bohemia . The resort itself was the mellow yin to Bohemia 's unruly yang . But it needed something to attract new skiers and distinguish it from all the other low-angle , family-friendly resorts in the area . That 's where the snowcat comes in . " We decided that because it 's in a wilderness park , we 'd promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Porkies ' two double chairs , waiting for the cat to get fixed . In keeping with the wilderness motif , he promptly hired a local tree trimmer named Denny to clear out 150 acres of gently sloped hardwood forest and paid a company in Colorado $38,000 for the diesel-powered cat . Which was indeed designed for the Swedish military . And actually is waterproof . Thanks to its lightweight design and watertight undercarriage , the vehicle purportedly has a top water speed of 2.5 miles per hour . To promote the Everest experience , Lonie slapped a snapshot his girlfriend took of Keystone , Colorado 's resort-based cat-skiing operation on his website , hoping it would be enough to entice people to the Porkies for the first time  --  and pay an additional $15 a day for unlimited cat rides . Although normally forthcoming and outspoken to a fault , Lonie squirms a bit when I chide him about the picture . And then I ask what inspired him to name his latest enterprise after the world 's tallest peak . " I 've learned that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , you got ta go over the top . " His Marketing 101 lecture continues the rest of the chairlift ride , and at one point he starts citing what to those of lesser wit would appear to be completely unrelated examples . " Take a company like FastSigns . What do you think the company FastSigns does ? " he asks me . They make signs quickly , I offer . " Exactly , they make signs fast . " Got it . Day two begins on a decidedly brighter note . It 's Saturday . The parking lot is full , and a group of skiers partying in an RV have already broken out the Jgermeister . The driveshaft is fixed , and the cat is sold out . Wait a minute . " The cat is sold out ? " " Yup , all thirty-five spots , gone in about an hour , " Randy , the Porkies " roundish ticket seller tells me proudly . Maybe this thing 's going to fly after all , I think . Maybe Lonie is n't nuts to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest . Maybe it 's enough of an attraction to put the Porkies on the map . We 're a motley crew of cat-skiers : no women or core telemark types , mostly regular , down-to-earth guys from Wisconsin , including an electrician , a carpenter , and a couple of masons . A few gangly students from nearby Michigan Tech made it out , as did a group of goofy Russian-speaking men  --  a Latvian , a Ukrainian , and two brothers from Belarus ( walk into a bar )  --  who live in Chicago . Lonie 's marketing push has worked . Most of the clients read about Everest on the website and are here today specifically for the cat-skiing . Encompassing about 100-plus acres just west of the resort , Everest is 787 vertical feet of undulating , 25-degree glades . The cat 's uptrack  --  a jostling six-minute ride  --  is a green run that 's roped off when the cat 's running . Besides a large ravine and a few big rocks , there are n't too many distinguishing features . Officially , there are 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or signs . You might be on Sir Edmund Hillary , Golden Monkey , or Yeti  --  or any of the other Everest-themed names that Lonie , being Lonie , randomly plucked from online articles about the Himalayan Everest . The handful of mostly freeheeled locals , who have been skiing back here for years , still refer to the area as The Radio Tower . Almost everyone overshoots the unmarked traverse his first time , arriving back at the cat sweaty and pissed off after a 15-minute boot-pack/shuffle . But besides a few snowboarders and first-time powder skiers , who either flail in the untracked snow or ca n't keep enough speed through the flat section , everyone 's spirits are high . Eric , a young mason from Oconomowoc , Wisconsin , is so excited about the prospect of cat-skiing that he brings along a bag lunch . " I 'm not leaving the cat all day , " he tells me . The enthusiasm is contagious . I straightline a run just to see if I can beat the cat back down . I do . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no ski rack on the vehicle , but we eventually wise up and start shoving our skis through the cat 's moonroof , their tips peeking out of the top of the cat . As we unload I try to convince a few people to explore farther skier 's left , but most everybody gets funneled into the ravine that spits you out right above the traverse . Just as we fall into a rhythm , the cat overheats . To lessen the strain on the engine  --  a Chrysler 318 , which one of the masons identifies just by listening to it idle  --  Nathan informs us that he 'll take nine at a time for the rest of the afternoon . There are a dozen of us . Two Michigan Tech engineering students and I volunteer to hang back and catch the next one . As the cat roars off , we grimace as it drizzles a stream of neon-green coolant in its wake . My first instinct is to alert Nathan , and I get up to do so , but I hesitate  --  it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . While we wait for our turn , the engineering students tell me they hope the kinks get worked out . " Michigan has never had any good tree skiing , " says one , " and now we do . " We keep waiting . Fifteen minutes pass with no sign of the cat ... and no skiers . A snowmobile whizzes by . A little while later the cat limps down Everest with smoke pouring out . The day is over . It 's late April , and I 'm following the blogs from Nepal as the real Everest Base Camp swells with high-profile funhogs and risk-dependent ego-trippers . As part of the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , a Chinese team prepares to test-run the torch to the top , while over on the north side four Americans are arrested at Base Camp for staging ( and filming ) a Free Tibet protest that later appears on YouTube . There 's the typical chaos , but it 's not as impressive as last year , when Martyna Wojciechowska became the first Playboy playmate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood atop the summit for three minutes  --  naked  --  setting a Guinness World Record for " highest naked person . " Still , the reports get me thinking about my Everest . I call up Nathan , who informs me that by cutting out the belly pan , putting in an auxiliary fan , and installing a lower-temperature thermostat , they figured out how to keep the cat from overheating . I also catch up with Lonie , who is pleased with how the inaugural season ended up . " The last two weekends we did n't have any breakdowns or delays , " he says . In total , he estimates that about 370 men , women , and children cat-skied Everest . Which , given all the mechanical issues and the crappy snow year , is pretty impressive  --  until you consider that 491 people summited the actual Everest last year . But that 's not what this story is about . Sure , the cat may be on the fritz and Everest it 's not , but do n't overanalyze it . Cough up the extra 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get it ? Got it .
