THE ULTIMATE GIFT : Organ Donation Hats off to two people who know first-hand the value of giving , or receiving , something more precious than money . Thirteen years ago , Donald Arthur , of New York City , had a heart transplant . His donor was a twenty-five-year-old father of two who was shot in the head . Through tragedy came one blessing : the victim 's organs saved five lives in all . Arthur began competing in marathons with his new heart , and in 1999 his donor 's brother and he raced together in the New York City marathon . He 's since done thirty-nine more marathons ( walking now instead of running ) around the country . Today Arthur is retired and devotes his time to Transplant Speakers International ( transplant-speakers.org ) , through which he spreads the word about organ donation . " Nationwide , about 100,000 people need transplants . This year 6,000 to 7,000 will die waiting for an organ , " says Arthur . " My donor gave me the opportunity to know my grandchildren . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , donated one of her kidneys to her best friend 's husband , who was dying , at forty-seven , of kidney failure . " I 'm delighted to report that we are both doing great , " she says . Weisband , a publicist with Crystal Cruises , praises community message boards on sites like Kidney.org . When she underwent testing and prepared to be a donor , Weisband adds , " the site was invaluable to me , and now it 's tops on my philanthropy list .
