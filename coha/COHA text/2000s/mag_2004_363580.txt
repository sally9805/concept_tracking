You do n't have to pay hundreds of dollars to get digital video on the go . The Zvue from Handheld Entertainment is just a little larger than a deck of cards and lets you play both its own 20-minute videos and your own MP3s and videos , which you can copy onto blank memory cards that slide into the unit . Targeted at the video-game crowd , ages 8 to 25 , the Zvue has a bright color screen and 20 different videos  --  mostly hip-hop performances , street car races and extreme sports like snowboarding . With videos priced at $15 for a 20minute clip , however , we would like content from more popular names like 50 Cent or ESPN Sports . And transferring your music and videos to the unit is more complicated than it should be . Available now for $99 at
