AIDS research is filled with Holy Grails  --  developing a vaccine , creating drugs that can cure the disease and , for both historical as well as treatment reasons , finding out how and when the virus emerged in the first place . The earliest sample of HIV-infected human blood dates back to 1959 , but before that , the HIV family tree is bare . <P> Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory turned computers to the task , and last week they came up with what they hope is the very bottom of that tree . By measuring the rate at which the virus has mutated since the epidemic began , they calculated that HIV made its first appearance sometime around 1930 . The work does not establish whether the virus showed up first in humans or in chimps , but the prevailing theory is that infected animals passed the virus on to people . <P> If true , the earlier date casts serious doubt on several controversial theories that purport to trace the beginning of the epidemic to the 1950s  --  specifically to experimental polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . A more likely scenario : the virus passed from animal to man during hunting and butchering when human and infected chimp blood intermingled . <P> While a computer model is not as persuasive as a real virus , it may be  --  given the lack of reliable blood samples from earlier decades  --  the closest researchers will ever get to the roots of the AIDS epidemic . <P>  --  By Alice Park
