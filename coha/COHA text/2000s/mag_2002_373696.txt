Gary Winnick , the flamboyant chairman of Global Crossing , is expected to be the next embattled executive to take the Fifth Amendment on Capitol Hill , when he appears this week before Representative Billy Tauzin 's House Energy and Commerce Committee . " We want to know what Mr. Winnick knew about the shaky state of company finances when he cashed in , " says Investigations Subcommittee chairman James Greenwood . But what it does n't get from Winnick , the committee may learn from documents that suggest Winnick was well aware of Global 's financial troubles even as the company  --  stop us if you 've heard this before  --  was presenting a rosy picture to Wall Street . At a Feb. 26 , 2001 , meeting in his office , according to documents obtained by TIME , Winnick learned that Global was $200 million short of the first-quarter target set by Wall Street . Yet as Global got ready to publicly report its performance two months later , CEO Tom Casey cited " record results in cash revenue " in a conference call with top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again the company has exceeded the consensus estimate of analysts for the first quarter , " he said . The analysts promptly urged investors to buy heavily in Global , a worldwide network of fiber-optic cable . The stock briefly spiked , luring more capital from everyone but Global insiders . On May 23 , Winnick sold shares worth $123 million . <P> House investigators believe Global used legally questionable methods to inflate its revenue  --  " capacity swaps , " in which Global and other firms sold each other access to their networks and booked the sales as revenue . These deals added $375 million to Global 's bottom line in the first quarter of 2001 , sources say , and Winnick approved one just hours before the quarter ended . These deals are now under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission . <P> Winnick 's lawyer , Gary Naftalis , says Global did not mislead investors but believed it would make its first-quarter target legitimately . He says Winnick 's stock sale was proper and approved by Global 's counsel . The committee has yet to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman Ken Johnson , " or did he steal from the church 's collection plate ? "  --  By Michael Weisskopf
