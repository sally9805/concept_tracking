The whitetail rut is one of the most studied phenomena in hunting , so you 'd think we 'd have had it all figured out long ago . But no  --  only recently , with the boom in deer populations and the growing popularity of trophy deer hunting , have many of the finer points of the whitetail breeding season been closely examined by biologists and observed by hardcore hunters . We may not have it all worked out yet , but we understand the rut much better today than we did only a couple of decades ago . Just like old habits , though , traditional ideas about the rut are hard to break away from . Here are five persistent misconceptions about the whitetail 's breeding season . Understanding the real facts can help you fill your tag now . Myth #1 The peak rut is the best time to take a buck . It 's easy to have a Pavlovian response to the words peak rut . We ca n't help it . Decades of magazine articles and deer-camp conversations have created a conditioned response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whitetail breeding season . Instead , we should be taking off a little earlier . Bucks are actually most mobile and vulnerable just prior to the most intense breeding activity , during a seven-to 10-day period called the " seeking " or " chasing " phase of the rut . By contrast , the very heart of the whitetail breeding season can bring some pretty lousy hunting because a large percentage of bucks are likely to be holed up with receptive does . According to noted biologist and whitetail expert Grant Woods , the seeking and chasing phase is a time when bucks are raring to go but few does are yet in estrus . As a result , anxious bucks can be found on their feet at almost any time of day  --  checking scrapes , making rubs , and seeking and chasing does . " For anyone who knows their hunting area and its deer well , " Woods says , " this is the best time to take a buck . " My own experience has certainly confirmed this : The last four trophy bucks I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chasing phase . I 'd choose that period to hunt instead of the peak rut every time . Myth #2 Rutting bucks are impossible to pattern . Deer hunters rarely complain about the rut , but when they do , this is usually their gripe . It happens because once does begin coming into estrus , bucks do indeed leave their home areas , abandon their rub lines and scrapes , and begin traipsing over the countryside in search of ready mates . But bucks do n't wander haphazardly . Rather , they move quite predictably from one doe family group to another . Larger bucks especially , which travel less than immature ones , will almost never be far from the females . So , just as you might set up near a rub line during the early season , now you need to find the does and stay close by . Stephen F. Austin State University researcher and noted whitetail expert James Kroll does just that . " I try to work out the movement patterns of as many does as possible during the preseason . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will be in attendance for the next day or so , and there will be other bucks in the vicinity as well . " In other words , Kroll patterns the bucks by patterning the does . Myth #3 When the action is over , the rut is over . Just about every serious whitetail hunter has spent days watching deerless woods in mid-November and thought , The rut must be over . More likely , it is at its apex . Today 's expert hunters refer to this peak-rut lull as the " lockdown , " and it 's one of the most difficult times to fill your tag . When a buck senses that a doe is coming into estrus , he chases her into an area of remote or rugged cover where other bucks are less likely to find her . Once there , he 'll " tend " the doe-that is , mate with and stay near her-until she no longer accepts him . In the meantime , the pair moves very little . The result is an overall slowdown in the action . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , can pay off very handsomely because some bucks will resume actively seeking does soon . Myth #4 You might as well stay home during the post-rut . Not if you want to tag a trophy . Although it 's almost certain that you 'll see fewer bucks immediately after peak breeding than you would during the seeking and chasing phase , recent research by Mickey Hellickson , chief biologist at Texas ' renowned King Ranch , has revealed an excellent reason to keep hunting-and to bring a set of rattling horns with you . " We rattled to deer during three specific periods : just prior to peak breeding , during peak breeding , and for several weeks after , " Hellickson says . " While the number of responses in the post-breeding period was n't as high , the deer that responded were much more likely to be mature . These bucks are still actively seeking does . " This study mirrors the experience of Iowa whitetail expert and videographer Don Kisky , who has shot some of his best bucks during the post-rut . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown period , it 's usually a nice one , " he says . " And in each case , the big deer I 've killed then were moving from 10:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. If you can stay on stand all day , or at least through the midday period , you can definitely kill a monster whitetail . " Myth #5 The primary rut lasts about a month . This is Nature 's plan , as whitetail does have a roughly 28-day estrous cycle . But when doe numbers get out of control , which is a problem in many areas , the rut can last far longer than that . Biologist Grant Woods studied a property in New York 's Adirondacks where hunters had harvested almost no does for years . " The rut there lasted nearly four months , " he says . " In contrast , we studied a more balanced deer herd in Georgia and found that 95 percent of does were bred within a four-week period , with 50 to 60 percent of that breeding occurring during a 10-day spike . " Why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for deer and hunters , when the rut is intense and concentrated , as it usually is in a balanced herd , " Woods says . " A short rut is less stressful on bucks , for example , allowing them to recover and survive the winter better . Hunters benefit because they see much more intense rutting behavior , which makes most modern rut tactics-including rattling , calling , and using scents-more effective . " On the other hand , if your area has a low buck-todoe ratio , the rut will probably last longer , but aggressive tactics are less likely to work . Instead , still-hunt the fringes of doe feeding areas or sit all day on a funnel leading to these spots . Patience is the key-and the belief that during the rut , your luck can turn at any second . Illustration <p>                     @x Bar 1 <br> Hold Love Strong I <p> The first pain came at noon but she did n't tell anybody about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon being every part of such a precarious age . She watched TV . She popped pimples and studied her face in the bathroom mirror . She listened to the radio , sang along with songs , and laughed along with the afternoon DJs . She wrote in her diary . I still ca n't Beleve ! I 'm pregnant , she scribbled in bulbous letters that began and ended in curls . I ca n't beleve my belly is soooo big ! At five , she took a nap and awoke three hours later , home alone and in a wet bed . She thought it was pee , balled the sheets , put them in the trash , and told herself she was disgusting . Then it was midnight and the pain became a fiery Cinderella banging to flee her guts . Still , she ignored it . Twenty minutes later , another pain came like the previous one but angrier , and so along with the banging it tore at her , buckled her knees , and left her coiled and crying on the floor . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or something to distract her from the increasing frequency of such mercilessness ; or some kind of pliers to rip and wrench the pain out of her . She went to her best friend Cherrie 's apartment one floor below ours . It was a Friday night and she knew Cherrie would be awake watching TV . <p> " It 's just gas , " Cherrie decided , pouring my mother a glass of ginger ale in the kitchen . " What you eat ? " <p> " Some Ring Dings and a bag of Doritos , " said my mother . <p> " A whole bag , damn ! " Cherrie forced her surprise to fit into a whisper because her mother was asleep in one room , her big sister Candy was asleep in the other , and the walls in the apartment , like the walls in every Ever Park Project apartment , amplified even the slightest sound . <p> Although Cherrie had a way of convincing my mother that what was major was minor , and although my mother hoped that what was going on inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thirteen , so she was scared , maybe even desperate . <p> " Should I call James ? " she asked . <p> The year was 1982 . There were no cell phones or pagers so there was no way to get in touch with people unless you knew where they were or left a message where they would soon arrive . My grandmother and my mother 's sister , my Aunt Rhonda , would have been my mother 's first and second choices , but they had taken my Uncle Roosevelt and my cousins Donnel and Eric to see E.T . , so there was no way of speaking to them , and calling where they would arrive meant calling where she had just left . As for James , he was my father . That is , James Llewelyn Arthur sowed the seed that became me . He was twenty . The last time my mother and he spoke they fought over a retractable Bic pen . He wanted it . She would n't give it to him . He punched her breast . She stabbed him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since then he was gone and never found ; never found a phone ; never found another pen and paper to write a letter ; never found two twigs to rub together to make a small fire so a smoke signal would drift into the sky and prove he knew we were alive . <p> " James ? " said Cherrie , wiping her mouth after swigging straight from the two-liter bottle of ginger ale . " What 's he gon na do ? " <p> Although the answer could only be nothing , my mother used Cherrie 's phone to call James . Of course , there was no James to speak to . He was out said his grandmother , an old woman with a wobbly , frayed voice who was too lonely to even wonder , let alone ask , why my mother was calling so late . " You know , " she said , " come to think , I ai n't seen him since yesterday . I hope he comes home tonight . " <p> " Tell him Angela called , " blurted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " OK , Angela , that 's such a pretty name . I once had a dear friend named Anita . That 's a pretty name too . " <p> " Tell him I need to see him , that it 's real , real important . Tell him to call as soon as he comes in . It do n't matter what time it is . " <p> " He has your phone number ? " <p> " Yeah , " my mother answered , trying to sound confident yet wondering if he remembered it . <p> Because my mother had n't left a note nor trace of where she went and why she left , she and Cherrie ascended the stairs from the third floor to the fourth floor and returned to my grandma 's apartment . There , they sat on the plaid , mustard-colored couch and watched TV as if late night reruns of the Three Stooges could refute my mother 's pregnancy and pains and transport them to who they should have been at this time in their lives , nascent teenage girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidantes whose essential aims had yet to be developed and so needed to be discussed in that mighty gabbing and giggling best thirteen-year-old girlfriends do when awake after midnight . <p> Just as suddenly as each pain before , another crash tried to split my mother in half . She slammed herself into the back of the couch , and breathed so hard and fast snot flew from her nose . <p> " What 's it feel like ? " asked Cherrie , touching my mother 's round belly with both hands . <p> " God damn , fuck ! " said my mother , sweating and shaking her head no . " It 's like I got lightning inside me . " <p> When the pain dissipated , Cherrie got my mother a glass of water from the kitchen . Then there was the sound of keys opening the door , a click and clack and then two clacks more . Locks were being unlocked . Someone was about to be home . <p> " Ma ! " my mother shouted as if she had fallen down a dark hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> But it was n't my grandma . The door opened and my Aunt Rhonda walked in holding Eric in her arms , his legs dangling around her waist as he slept with his head burrowed in the crook of her neck . Eric was two and he was afflicted with a particular idiosyncrasy that made him somewhat of a spectacle . He was born with Sjgren 's syndrome so he could howl and shout , and he could screech and scream until every vein in his head seemed as if it might explode , but he could not cry . Never . Not once had there ever been nor would there ever be a tear in or falling from his eyes . <p> " Sorry we so late , " my Aunt Rhonda said , taking her keys out of the door so not yet looking at my mother . " The first movie was sold out , so we had to see the later one . " <p> My Aunt Rhonda was seventeen . She was five foot three inches tall , one hundred and ten peanut-butter-brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesson my mother was learning . That is , she only knew loving herself through seeking , finding , and being hurt by men who did not love themselves nor comprehend the value of being someone cherished . She said hello to Cherrie . Then she looked at my mother and her eyes got stuck . <p> " Jelly , what 's wrong ? " she asked , calling my mother by the nickname she had given her when she was a little girl . <p> " She got gas , " said Cherrie . " I made her drink some ginger ale . She 'll be all right soon . " <p> " See , " my Aunt Rhonda scolded . " I told you to stop fucking with all that junk food . " <p> Through the open door my Uncle Roosevelt strode into the apartment , dragging my Aunt Rhonda 's eldest son , my cousin , weary-eyed , half-asleep four-year-old Donnel by the hand behind him . <p> " Damn , Jelly , " Roosevelt said . " Why you look so crazy ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-year-old who already owned the kingly disposition only the world 's most blessed men approach possessing . His grace was astounding . No season , situation ; no rage , pain , or suffering touched him . He let go of Donnel 's hand , crossed in front of my Aunt Rhonda , and came to the couch . <p> " How 's the baby ? " he asked . <p> " Where 's Ma ? " my mother said . <p> " She 's coming , " my Aunt Rhonda answered . " She got stuck talking to Mr. Goines outside . " <p> " He loves her , " added my Uncle Roosevelt , stating what everyone knew to be truth . <p> He leaned over my mother and put his ear against her belly . Suddenly my mother winced and moaned and was racked with a wave of pain that made her nostrils flare , lips quiver , and her body shudder as if her ribs were pounding her organs to pieces . My Aunt Rhonda ran to her , seamlessly handing Eric to my Uncle Roosevelt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tucked the boy 's head beneath his chin without waking him . <p> " Jelly , " said Rhonda wiping the sweat from my mother 's forehead with her hand . " Jelly , your water break ? " <p> " I do n't know , " my mother moaned . " It just hurts . " <p> When the contraction ended my Aunt Rhonda told Cherrie to call an ambulance . <p> " No , " said my mother . <p> " What you mean , ' No ' ? " my Aunt Rhonda asked . She stood tall , planted her hands on her hips , and looked down at my mother . " We got to get you to the hospital . " <p> " James is gon na call , " said my mother . <p> My Aunt Rhonda sucked her teeth and rolled her eyes as if making a red circle around an incorrect answer in the air . " Jelly , you about to burst ! " she scolded . " We do n't got time for James . " <p> " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the type of man who gave a damn or sacrificed in the name of what was necessary , just , and good . My mother was impulsive and headstrong . We were going to be a family is all she believed . That 's it , that seventh-grade cusp of pubescent confusion , that dream trumped all truth . That conviction was her head and heart and the construction of her vital organs . James would come around . He would realize it was only a pen and she did n't mean to stab him . It was only a matter of time . They would raise me together . She paid no mind to my Aunt Rhonda 's history , the other young histories pushing strollers in the neighborhood , nor what anyone warned her . James Llewelyn Arthur loved her infinity . That 's what he told her just before the first times but never after , just before she gave him her virginity , just before the first time she gave him head , just before she let him go down on her , bury his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of her body she had never studied in the mirror nor had the courage to touch herself . <p> My grandma came into the apartment . " What are you all crazy or something ? " she scolded . " Why is this door open ? " <p> " Ma , " my mother whimpered . <p> My grandma did n't speak . She did n't blink or breathe . A passionately constructed woman of only thirty , she swiftly studied the scene . She looked at my mother . She looked at Cherrie . She looked at Rhonda . All of my grandma 's features possessed a depth and delicacy that made her and everything within ten feet of her beautiful . Her body and being were balance . Her arms were long and muscular as were her legs , fingers , neck , earlobes , and the length of time her laughter lasted . <p> " When was the last one ? " she asked . <p> " Just before . Maybe not even two minutes , " said my Aunt Rhonda . She slammed her eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the fuck I say ? " <p> Cherrie sprinted into the kitchen , where our phone sat on the counter , and my grandma and my Aunt Rhonda led my mother into the bathroom because the couch was my grandma 's first and only couch and even though she bought it used she refused for it to be ruined or even slightly stained by anyone or anything , even birth , no matter how divine an occasion it was . <p> " Mind your nephews ! " my grandma told Roosevelt . <p> " I got them , " he said , taking Donnel 's hand , leading him and his wide eyes to sit on the couch , and then sitting beside him with Eric , still sleeping , balanced against him . <p> In the kitchen , Cherrie turned the rotary dial , held the phone to her ear , and listened . Nothing . She tapped the switch-hooks hoping that there was some kind of short , or that one of the buttons was stuck . Still , nothing . She slammed the phone into the cradle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Nothing . She slammed the handset down . <p> " It 's dead ! " she cried out . There ai n't even a dial tone ! " <p> My grandma closed her eyes and cursed everything under her breath , Queens and the state of New York , the phone company and Ever Park , life , herself , America . The phone could have been dead for one of any number of reasons : the phone bill had n't been paid ; the phone company did n't do the proper upkeep ; someone in our building cut a wire thinking splicing it would give them phone service . <p> " Go downstairs , " shouted my grandma . " Do n't act like you ai n't got no sense ! Use yours . And if that do n't work go use a pay phone ! Shit , Cherrie , do n't just give up ! " <p> Cherrie bolted out of our apartment like my grandma 's voice was fire and the drum of Cherrie 's heavy feet could be heard thumping down the stairs until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it opened then boomed when it closed . <p> In the bathroom , my grandma and my Aunt Rhonda helped my mother take off her clothes . <p> " My shirt too ? " asked my mother . <p> " Shirt too , " ordered my grandma . " Unless you got the money to pay for a new one if it gets bloody . " <p> So off came my mother 's shirt and for a moment my grandma , my aunt , and my mother just stood there , three proximate shades of black women , autumnal hues in a small , plain bathroom with white walls , a white porcelain sink , a white bathtub , and a white toilet with a broken black plastic seat . My grandma and my Aunt Rhonda looked at my mother , who , looking in the bathroom mirror , looked at herself as well . In addition to the disposition and body type of my grandma , my mother was the color of an old penny at the bottom of a wishing well . Equally , she reflected and absorbed sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her , then cast her off . Her eyes and lips , her nose , shoulders and breasts , even her thighs and hips were shaped like new leaves , full yet still timid , still approaching their eventual lustrous peak . <p> My grandma snatched the red bath towel from the back of the bathroom door and put it on the floor . " Here , " she decided . " Lay down on this . And Rhonda , get behind and hold her . That baby is coming . I can feel it . We ai n't got much time . " <p> My mother lay down . The bathroom was so small her head crossed the threshold of its doorway . Behind my mother , on her knees , wrapping her arms around her and wedging her thighs against my mother 's back , my Aunt Rhonda kneeled on the coarse , grey carpet of the living room . My grandma stepped into the bathtub . She hiked her skirt up over her knees , squatted , and put my mother 's ankles on her shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lord have some motherfucking mercy on me . " <p> My mother sweated , shivered , and writhed from the pain and the fright . Another contraction came and went . Then she cursed and screamed and told my grandma she did n't want to live no more . <p> " Jelly , shut your mouth ! " demanded my grandma . " Stop thinking about yourself ! You about to be a mother ! " <p> On the couch , Donnel asked question after question and Eric awoke and hollered for my Aunt Rhonda . He reached for her . He fought to get out of my Uncle Roosevelt 's arms . My uncle tried to keep them calm . He hushed them . He softly sang verses of spontaneously composed lullabies . He tried to remind my cousins about the movie they just saw , how ET had a magic finger and loved Reese 's Pieces candy . <p> My mother quaked with another contraction and she moaned and rolled her head from side to side as if her neck and spine were suddenly severed . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly , her eyes so wide it seemed she was surprised by the sight . She put her hands on it , and with her fingers spread as wide as they could stretch , my mother began to weep . But it was not weeping caused by physical pain , or by ignorance , or even a weeping caused by fear . My mother wept because although she was still a child she had enough sense to understand that she was not prepared to shape my life . She could n't multiply or divide . She did n't know north , south , east , or west . She could n't tell time on a regular clock . This is not to say she was dumb . In fact , my mother was brilliant , so smart she could remember all of the words in a song after hearing it just once . What my mother was then was the product of low expectations . She had been failed so she had failed . And yet , social promotion : she had just graduated the seventh grade . <p> But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begged my grandma to make the pain stop , to let her quit , my grandma said , " No ! " My mother could n't stop , not even if great God Almighty Himself said she could quit . And so , because my grandma was not the type of woman anyone could disregard , my mother pushed with her life . She clenched the air in her fists . She gritted her teeth . She closed her eyes so tightly she saw everything she 'd ever wished to see , every mountain and ocean , every sandy beach , tropical waterfall ; elephants and lions and giraffes in Africa ; she saw Jesus , she shook President Reagan 's hand ; she saw the Statue of Liberty ; herself with a car , a fur coat ; a collie like Lassie ; she saw herself as a movie star . Her toes curled . Her calves cramped . Her heart became a volcano bursting blood . She saw her dreams . She felt their temperature . She smelled them . <p> My grandma saw my head . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , holding one hand up as if halting a train , she shouted : " STOP ! " <p> Every muscle in my mother 's body went limp . My umbilical cord was wrapped twice around my neck . My mother 's pushing combined with my twisting and turning was killing me . I was being lynched and I was hanging myself . My face was the color of an electric blue bruise . One more push or pull , one more twist , and I was dead . My mother begged to understand what was happening . <p> " Momma , " she said , propping herself on her elbows . " Momma , please . " <p> " What 's wrong ? " asked Rhonda . " Ma , what is it ? " <p> My grandma breathed deep . " Shh , both of you , let me think . " <p> Outside of the bathroom , Eric stopped hollering , Donnel stopped asking questions , and my Uncle Roosevelt stopped hushing and singing lullabies . All of Ever Park , all of Queens went silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They coming ! " she shouted . " A ambulance is on the way ! " <p> My Aunt Rhonda looked over her shoulder at Cherrie , her eyes demanding silence . <p> Cherrie stopped in the middle of the living room . " What 's going on ? " Cherrie said , her voice a fraction of its preceding size . <p> In the bathroom , my grandma looked up at the ceiling . " God , " she whispered . " Jesus . Somebody , please help me save this child . " <p> My grandma took one deep breath , closed her eyes , and made the same prayer silently . Then she opened her eyes , gently held my head and slowly drew my shoulders free . She paused to think . What next ? What could she possibly do ? The umbilical cord was taut . She cupped her hand beneath me , breathed , then cautiously guiding me in an unhurried somersault , she turned me upside down , freed my legs , and unwound the umbilical cord from my neck . My grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first nine months of my life . She cleared my nostrils and mouth with her pinky . Then she wiped the blood from me with the palm of her hand . <p> " Roosevelt ! " she called out . " Get me a knife ! A sharp one . One of the ones with the wooden handles . " <p> But it was n't my uncle who brought my grandma the knife . It was Donnel . Like a miniature Mercury , he burst into the bathroom and held the knife out to her . Then he stood on his tiptoes and looked at the new life my grandma cradled to her chest . <p> " This your baby cousin , " she said . She pushed me into his arms . " Now , hold love strong . " <p> Donnel held me against his chest like a ball of loose yarn and my grandma cut my umbilical cord and left me the ugliest outie the world has ever seen . She washed me in the sink and handed me to my mother . And as my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wept and dealt with the awe of my making , Rhonda asked what my name should be because my mother had not yet been able to settle on one . <p> " Abraham , " my grandma announced . <p> " Like the president ?

Maybe the various manifestations of her physical , emotional , spiritual , and intellectual immaturity pervaded me , infected me with the particulars of my nature . <p> My grandmother told her not to worry . She shrugged off all fears and doubts . She said I was Job ; Jonah in the belly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert . It was my great patience that would help me overcome everything the world , this life , gave me . <p> Of course , my mother did n't believe her . She could n't . She did n't have the capability . She was a teenager . How she felt , not facts or biblical stories , burned inside of her , mingled with her desire to dance and flirt and the fantasy that there was a brother who was her prince , who would soon arrive , ride into Ever on his horse , his magic carpet , in a car , a boat , a plane , and whisk her away , take us to a land where she was queen . <p> Yet , because she was the only parent of a black boy from the projects she also knew herself as the sole remaining partner of a creation that would not only outgrow her but also live in a land that , if it did not despise me , certainly made it difficult for my soul to achieve a human level of peace . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so long , that her role as the center , the cause , and the solution of what occurred in my life was a fleeting post . The summation of these facts caused her to doubt herself , perhaps even hate herself . That she was already a mother at thirteen , and what motherhood meant for the remainder of her life , was often , if not always , too tremendous a weight for her to bear . So , although she did no greater wrong than what both my Aunt Rhonda and my grandma had done before her , having a child while still children themselves , my mother was fraught with self-abasement , and eventually , mortal defeat . In her diary , she cursed herself . She cried at night . She was ornery . She acted out , threw tantrums and doled out silent treatment as if extreme action would both reverse her life and provide her control over it . Some days she could n't bring herself to pick me up , to hold me , to feed me or change my diaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not hers . She could leave me outside , put me on the stoop of a church , leave me on the bus or train with a note . Maybe the pawnshop would take me . Maybe some rich white woman in Long Island needed a small , brown novelty . Maybe she could take me to an ocean , a river , lay me down , sail me away . <p> While my mother struggled with how tremendously my arrival into the world had changed her life , Donnel , encouraged by my grandmother , propelled by both curiosity and an already intact sense of paternal responsibility that belied his age , slowly assumed more and more responsibility over me . He loved to hold me , to feed me , to proclaim that I , Abraham , was his baby cousin . He , when my mother could n't , owned my well-being . At the park , in the waiting room of the sulfurous city health clinic with the failing fluorescent lights , in the Laundromat , on the bus , through summer 's hottest days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went shopping along the avenue , Donnel carried me , moored me upon his narrow hip . According to my grandmother , never had a brother so young walked with such pride ; never had a boy emanated a holy power of unconquerable manhood . <p> Donnel taught me how to speak . He taught me how to hold a bottle . He reveled in making me giggle and smile . And like a puppeteer , he taught me how to walk . He stood in front of me , held me by my hands and helped me balance , then walked backward as I walked forward . I moved where his hands , his eyes , his smile led me . I lifted and dragged my feet according to his desire . By the time he was five , Donnel , with limited supervision and later no supervision at all , determined if and when I soiled myself , then changed me , gently laid me on a kitchen chair or the couch or , when need be , utilizing the dexterity and balance only available to fearless children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , pressed me against his body , nestled me in the crux between his rib , arm , and abdomen . <p> The bond Donnel and I had , the bond he was unconsciously but purposefully building was , in its essence , the fundamental mooring and foundation of my family . We were not grandmother , daughters , sisters , or sons . We were not uncle , aunts , and cousins . We were brothers . Our love was unwavering , unflappable , greater than anything presented by the Bible , the Torah , and the Qur'an combined . That is , where we 'd go , what would occur , what we lost and gained together , what we suffered and championed through , what we sometimes wished to recall and force ourselves to forget , our lives , the occasions and circumstances , were more than everything , more than forever , more than even the truth.Copyright 2009 by Matthew Goodman <br> Continues ...
