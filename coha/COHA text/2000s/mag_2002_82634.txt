In a perfect Ryder Cup , a ) Sergio Garc ? a would drink decaf , b ) the home team would n't make the rules and c ) Curtis Strange would be given the wrong dates . // But last week 's Ryder Cup at the Belfry in The Place Charm Forgot  --  Birmingham , England  --  was anything but perfect . // Start with Captain Strange , who has given more gifts to Europe than the Marshall Plan . As a player in 1995 he bogeyed the last three holes when a par on any of them would 've kept the Cup in the U.S. This time he drew up the dumbest starting lineup since the 1962 Mets , sabotaging an American team that was as heavily favored as a hurricane over a ladybug. // Strange placed his three guns  --  Tiger Woods , Phil Mickelson and Davis Love ( Nos. 1 , 2 and 7 in the world )  --  at the end of his Sunday singles order . // Meanwhile , Europe captain Sam Torrance brained him by loading his six best players at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused the crowd and inspired the six mediocre Euro golfers playing behind them to greatness . Woods and Love played matches that did n't mean anything . They could 've been jetting home Sunday morning . // " We could n't have handpicked a draw better for us today , " said Euro Jesper Parnevik . " When we saw the draw , everyone knew we were going to win . " // Strange was dumbfounded . " I 've never seen somebody front-load like this , " he said . // Uh , hello ? Curtis ? Loading the front is exactly how Ben Crenshaw pulled off the Miracle at Brookline in 1999 . Trailing by four points , Crenshaw put his six best players at the top , painted the leader board red early and shocked the world . Where was Strange living then , Iceland ? // The 2004 Ryder Cup at Oakland Hills could also do without Garc ? a , the Little Engine that Would n't Stop Jumping Up and Down Annoyingly Until You Wanted to Beat Him Senseless with a Two-Iron . His 10-meter dives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three-foot par putt ? Garc ? a acted as if he 'd just cured cancer . But when he lost a team match on Saturday night , he was no longer so cute , kicking his bag and his driver over and over . // " He does n't win with class , " Love 's caddie , John Burke , fumed , " and he does n't lose with class . " // When the Euros wrapped up the Cup , despite Garc ? a 's singles loss to David Toms , Surge-io was hap-hap-happy again , charging 200 yards down the 18th fairway , jumping into the arms of anybody who 'd catch him and then making imaginary snow angels in the fairway  --  all while Love was trying to hit into 18 . Love 's opponent , Pierre Fulke , sheepishly offered Love a halve on the hole , and Love took it , nearly stepping on Garc ? a 's neck as he left . // " Sergio is Sergio , " Love said , teeth clenched , " and that 's all I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played his shot anyway . About 100 Euros were dancing , leaping and cartwheeling on the 18th green , pushing the excessive-celebration envelope . " But we 're poor sports when we do it , " Hal Sutton grumbled . // Then there was the Swede , Niclas Fasth , who was slightly more intense than a bottle of Ephedra . " I wanted to fight him all day , " said Paul Azinger , who tied him by holing a stunning bunker shot at 18 . " He was pumping his fist from the first hole . I told his caddie , ' What is that crap ? ' I mean , what 's he trying to do , incite me ? " // Finally , is there any competition in the world as stupidly run as a Ryder Cup ? To combat U.S. strengths , Torrance got to set the speed of the greens ( slow ) , the width of the fairways ( he pinched them at 290 yards ) and the length of the holes ( he ruined the greatest match-play hole in the world , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the green )  --  everything but the order of Strange 's singles lineup , and Strange wound up doing that/or him . Do the Los Angeles Dodgers get to move the fences back when they play Barry Bonds ? // So , until the U.S. and British PGAs do the right thing and turn the match setup over to an independent body  --  say , the PGA of Australia  --  may we suggest the following for 2004 : // a ) Open the fairways wider than the Santa Monica Freeway . b ) Overnight , secretly mow some greens short and only tell U.S. players . c ) Arm marshals with tranquilizer darts , just in case you-know-who bounces by .
