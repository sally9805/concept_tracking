SETTING THE STAGE Opposite page : Zaha Hadid transcended traditional architecture when she designed a set for the Pet Shop Boys , top . Bottom : The top of Hadid 's Vitra Fire Station in Weil am Rhein , Germany . // INSPIRED BY THE RUNWAYS , ROCK &; ROLL , AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB , A NEW BREED OF ARCHITECTS IS PRODUCING WORK THAT EXPLODES OLD-FASHIONED IDEAS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BUILD . BY BRADFORD MCKEE Architect Zaha Hadid has designed all kinds of buildings , some that have been built to great acclaim and others that have been deemed too radical , but none of her past work led her to expect that she would end up collaborating with the Pet Shop Boys . One day in early 1999 , Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe arrived at Hadid 's offices to talk about their upcoming world tour . They wanted her to design the stage sets . " I had met them once before , " recalls Hadid , 49 , who made her reputation with a dangerous-looking fire station for the campus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked their work , particularly their videos . They seemed to have a great sense of space . " The resulting stage design-complete with swooping trapezoidal platforms for the band , kinetic lights , and video projections-became nothing less than a performer in the show and garnered Hadid what was perhaps her widest and most unlikely audience yet . Architecture , often called the " mother art " but more often relegated to the mother-in-law apartment of our minds , is learning to play the pop-culture game . After sitting on the sidelines for much of the ' ' 70s and ' ' 80s , architecture has suddenly gone from stuffy to sexy , from obscurity to full-on popular fascination . " Architects have a new identity , " says Hadid . " Now people are looking to them to interpret ideas going on in society , not just to design a kitchen or something . " Thanks to such architects as Hadid , Frank Gehry ( whose sexy , shape-shifting design for the Guggenheim Museum , Bilbao , turned the 71-year-old into something of a media celebrity ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been designing stores for Prada ) , people are once again recognizing that architecture can create high drama in the workaday world . And a new generation of architects is rising to prominence-a generation convinced that postmodern pastiche has grown old , as have the dogmas of pure modernism and classicism . This new breed of designer eagerly embraces multimedia toys and the Internet , frequently crosses over into the fine arts and performance , and is likely to be as influenced by fashion as by Frank Lloyd Wright . New York architects Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio do not represent anybody 's familiar version of an architect . Their firm , Diller + Scofidio , has built an impressive range of projects-from the dramatic , subterranean Brasserie restaurant in New York 's historic Seagram Building to an austere , ultramodern apartment house in Gifu , Japan . But more intriguingly , they 've positioned themselves as social agitators , connecting architecture with the broader culture by fusing it with the visual and performing arts . This month , the team is unveiling the first phase of an unusual new project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York 's John F Kennedy International Airport . The installation , closer to conceptual art than to architecture , consists of a series of storytelling panels positioned along the corridors between the gates and customs . The panels are made of a lenticular material , which , like a Cracker Jack toy , changes appearance depending on the viewer 's angle , forming a kind of moving picture as passengers walk by . There will be several installations of the Travelogues panels throughout the concourse . Each tells a different story , but each narrative is based upon its main character 's suitcase . " The suitcase is the object that links the space of home with the space of travel , " explains Diller , a slight , pixieish woman who seems forever absorbed in her thoughts . " The unpacking of a suitcase is the telling of a personal story , a journey . " In Diller + Scofidio 's work , the idea of architecture as a passive container for human beings yields to a much more challenging notion of how outside objects and interior spaces affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for architecture to survive the booming voice of media , it has to redefine itself within the context of a complex culture , " Diller insists . She and Scofidio make their living largely by capturing the ephemera of the digital age . In that vein , their first major building will barely look like a building at all . The Blur Building , as it 's called , will be built offshore on Switzerland 's Lake Neuchatel for the National Expo 2002 , a kind of miniature world 's fair . The building will be 300 feet wide but will look like a cloud floating 75 feet above the lake 's surface . Its weblike frame will hold thousands of high-pressure nozzles that spray a continuous dense mist . Diller and Scofidio refer to it as " immaterial architecture , " a real building whose substance appears to constantly dissolve . It 's been years since such provocative design arrived on the scene so conspicuously , which is probably the reason the MacArthur Foundation awarded Diller + Scofidio its first-ever fellowship to architects in 1999 . Thanks to firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide audience at the moment , " notes Terence Riley , chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York . People who follow fine art or film as a social barometer are now realizing that architecture , too , has much to say . " To the extent that architecture is taking a serious cultural interest , people are following it , " says Riley . That function , he adds , " used to be the province of art . " Architects have been quick to examine what the new-media explosion means to their work as they reassess our most basic needs for space . Some , like Giuseppe Lignano and Ada Tolla , the Italian expat founders of a small New York architecture firm called LOT/EK ( pronounced " low tech " ) , welcome the onslaught of new technology . LOT/EK specializes in small-scale designs such as condominiums , retail stores , and galleries but also devotes a lot of time to installation art . Last month , Lignano and Tolla unveiled their latest project , an installation called Mixer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOT/EK recently expanded and redesigned . Mixer is an actual cement mixer that the firm has transformed into a kind of media-saturated sweat lodge . Upon climbing inside the small space , the viewer is assaulted by a battery of stimuli : VCRs , DVD players , cable TV , and a Sony PlayStation . Lignano and Tolla conceived of Mixer as a place to meditate to the barrage of media images . " Generally , people feel that it 's okay to be enchanted by a sunset but that it 's not okay to be hypnotized by the Internet , " Lignano says . " For us , it 's the opposite : What if we said , Technology can be a good aid to spiritual activities ' ' ? " It 's a similar openness to other disciplines that drives the work of Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos , founders of the UN Studio in Amsterdam , which has emerged in the past few years as one of the architecture world 's most provocative new firms . " We 've learned a lot from industrial design , fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says van Berkel . Their work is quite cerebral but also rivetingly sensual . The new Museum Het Valkhof in the Dutch city of Nijmegen is an aquamarine block that hugs the ground ; the electrical substation they 've designed in Innsbruck , Austria , is a mute black cube embellished by luminous glass panels ; and their Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam is a pure , white suspension structure that simply screams sex appeal . Van Berkel and Bos describe their explorations in breathless , brave-new-world tones : They speak of the architect acting as a " public scientist , " making new discoveries in the juxtapositions of real and virtual spaces . To judge by UN Studio 's Mobius house near Amsterdam , homes of the future will be wildly different . The plan for the house adapts the form of the theoretical infinite loop after which it 's named , allowing the occupants to move fluidly from living room to bedrooms to studio . " Living , working , and sleeping can be achieved in one gesture , " says van Berkel . The house , he adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And here we were thinking we 'd spend the rest of our lives in dull little boxes .

' s Melrose Avenue ; Ron Radziner ( left ) and Leo Marmot. // Last year , the duo published a three-volume , graphic-rich manifesto , Move ( Goose Press ) , to outline what van Berkel calls their " public and political " agenda . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , " the authors announce boldly in the first volume . " Learning from designers such as Calvin Klein , the architect will be concerned with dressing the future , speculating , anticipating coming events , and holding up a mirror to the world . " Fashion design and architecture have engaged in a kind of mutual thievery for years in their endless search for sublime materials and new structural expressions . But , lately , the ante has risen notably as every major fashion house seems to want a stunning building to call its own-which has helped as much as anything to put architecture back in the public eye . In the past few years alone , Helmut Lang has hired New York architect Richard Gluckman to redesign its retail stores . LVMH commissioned the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Christian de Portzamparc to put up a slinky , 23-story tower on East 57th Street in Manhattan . And Prada has hired Rem Koolhaas to design new stores in New York and Los Angeles , as well as an 11  --  story West Coast headquarters near San Francisco 's Union Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limestone , transparency and light . Whereas in the past , " serious " architects scoffed at the idea of heeding fashion 's call , today there 's a kind of exuberant freedom about exploiting the possibilities of offbeat forms , colors , and textures in architecture . Among the elite designers , the old rules of respect for the cityscapes around their buildings have become a given , and for firms like London 's Future Systems , it 's time to find out how they can have fun within those bounds . Future Systems was founded in 1979 , but its current principals , Jan Kaplicky and Amanda Levete , began working together 10 years later , turning out flamboyant designs for everything from houses-like their extraordinary glass structure built into a cliff in Wales-to massproduced aluminum and stainless-steel dining tables . Recently , Future Systems entered the fashion world in full when Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons , drawn by the firm 's serious sense of funk , hired it to design stores in Tokyo , Paris , and New York . The celebrated designs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves : The New York store features a polished-aluminum tube that delivers you to the boutique 's main space , while the outer facade of the Tokyo store is a wavy wall of spotted glass-every bit as formfitting as Kawakubo 's own designs . Future Systems has also built Marni stores in London and Tokyo , and finished designs for a voluptuous , shimmering Selfridges department store in Birmingham , England , slated for construction in 2003 . " It 's about presenting a label in a lifestyle way , " Levete muses . " Shopping is n't just about buying a dress . It 's about the theater of shopping . " Architecture 's most important work , however , still lies not on the stage or in the store , but at home . Which is why Karl Lagerfeld has hired architect Tadao Ando of Osaka to design a new retreat in the French seaside resort of Biarritz . And why Gucci 's Tom Ford has hired the Santa Monica firm of Marmol and Radziner to design houses for him in Southern California , London , and Santa Fe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early California modernism of Richard Neutra , Albert Frey ( whose coveted Palm Springs abode they brought back to life ) , and Charles and Ray Eames , midcentury heroes who championed the Southern California indoor-outdoor way of life . Yet , as classically contemporary as they seem , Marmol and Radziner maintain an old-fashioned ethic in that they are both licensed contractors-a rare credential among architects . They typically design and build their projects themselves with an exacting sense of craft . Ford found his nirvana in a Bel Air house designed by the master Neutra , who was revered for his basic but beguiling geometries and his palette of pure , spare surfaces and rich daylighting . The designer hired Marmol and Radziner to restore his house after seeing the firm 's preservation work on another Neutra house in Palm Springs , which garnered numerous awards . Recently , Marmol and Radziner completed the new Melrose outpost of Costume National and are now busy designing the San Francisco offices of the advertising firm TBWA/Chiat/Day , which is known for commissioning work spaces with a futuristic appeal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community-minded projects like the nonprofit Mark Taper Center , an inner-city arts school in downtown Los Angeles , and the new child-care center at the city 's airport . But they seem most at home with early modernism . " In these kinds of homes , there is truly a great quality of space , " remarks Radziner . " They 're really of our time . They 're not referring back to some 18th-century ideal that never existed . " Architecture owes its new allure to the rediscovery of the idea that the spaces in which we live , work , and play can be thrilling , engrossing , and surprisingly sensual , and that each waking moment can be a transcendent one . So far , architects have only scratched the surface of the ways digital media make it seemingly possible to build anything . Lignano of LOT/EK puts it best : Architecture may be the oldest art form , he says , but in our newly wired , image-conscious society , it 's " the last virgin beach .
