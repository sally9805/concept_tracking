COMPETING FRANCHISES ought to encourage civic stereotyping . As in , White Sox fans order Brie , Cubs brats . Whatever . We actually are n't sure what they order . ( We dine in the press box  --  on truffles . ) The point is , the fun of baseball rivalries should go beyond the game , which , after all , is always vulnerable to dulling homogenization . Attitudes are distinct , and they are forever . // What to say about Southern California , then ? One of the few remaining urban sprawls that can afford two baseball teams , one per league , the Los Angeles metroplex is eternally untroubled by opposing loyalties . The problem goes back to 1961 , when the Angels were invented . Whereas Walter O'Malley had performed a land grab and situated his transplanted Dodgers close to an actual downtown that you can find on a map , Gene Autry , the Singing Cowboy who owned radio stations and ought to have known better , eventually settled on a suburban outpost 40 miles away , in a land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbia ) and theme parks ( that would give way to more theme parks ) . In the process he surrendered a huge market and the possibility of a truly bitter rivalry . Have you ever driven L.A. 's freeway system ? There is nothing crosstown about it . // Sure , the Angels have played some pretty good baseball , paraded their share of Hall of Famers  --  Carew , Ryan , Reggie  --  around the field , even won a World Series . But they never acquired much of an identity or otherwise surmounted their suburban status . The Dodgers , on the other hand , were at least the Big Blue , always an attendance and standings powerhouse , five World Series championships , lots of celebs in the house . Their skipper , Tommy Lasorda , hobnobbed with Frank and did Carson , and just generally established a cult of personality . By location and choice , the Dodgers represented not only excellence but the entertainment culture . The Angels ? Were n't they down by Knott 's Berry Farm ? // But take a look now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they regularly draw three million fans and have the kind of consistent leadership that the Dodgers used to be known for . Is that an identity ? Is it a rivalry yet ? Well , probably not . The Dodgers still dominate the market by the standard metrics of sizzle . But that 's changing , however slowly , no question . Angels manager Mike Scioscia , who often commutes from Los Angeles to Anaheim for home games , has been blurring the distinction ever since he left the Dodgers organization in 2000 to manage the Angels . A sturdy catcher for Lasorda in the 1980s and ' 90s , Scioscia was presumed to be on the way to a job filling in the Dodgers lineup card in his organizational afterlife . After a couple of seasons as roving instructor , he was managing the Dodgers ' Triple A team in Albuquerque , as groomed as you could be . // Scioscia says now that he never expected to take over the Dodgers ' job . " There was no line of succession , if that 's what you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being held at bay until the Angels ' offer came , the Dodgers picking first Bill Russell , then Glenn Hoffman and Davey Johnson over him . The idea that he nurses his revenge on the 1 1/2-hour drive from his home in Thousand Oaks to Anaheim ( not that he 'd get to Dodger Stadium all that more quickly , let 's be real ) is delicious but not true . // What Scioscia has done , with the help of owner Arte Moreno , who rescued the franchise from an awful Disney synergy in 2003 , is raising a few eyebrows . Borrowing heavily from Dodgers tradition , Scioscia has introduced stability throughout the Angels ' organization and established new benchmarks for success . Four of his starting pitchers are homegrown , as are 26 players on his 40-man roster . And more to come , evidently , as six of the Angels ' seven minor league teams have made it to the playoffs. // " We have n't reinvented the wheel here , " Scioscia insists . In fact , he admits he 's pretty much copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's adopted the Dodgers ' longtime inclination toward base-path mayhem . " That always struck a chord with me , " he says , " the way they 'd teach getting from first to third . Especially all those years when they had no scoring and had to win 1 -- 0 . There 's an old saying : Do n't make your last out at third . We 're tearing that one up . " // That aggressiveness is just part of his philosophy , which prods players beyond their comfort zones . " We 'll get ugly outs , " he says , " but it 's all part of pushing the envelope . " This is a vague way of saying  --  manager-speak  --  that the Angels intend to irritate the opposition to death . They have a run-differential of just +68 , but their 100 -- 62 record was the best in baseball this year . // That alone , though , has not elevated the Angels to the same realm of consciousness that the Dodgers enjoy . It 's true , winning counts for a lot , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league way . Moreno , who came out of the outdoor-advertising business , is a shrewd owner . His first move , aside from cutting beer prices , was to change the team name to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim . " We had to break out of that box , the small , midsize market , " he says . " I took a lawsuit on that one . " Anaheim sued ( and lost ) , but Moreno was firm in turning this roadside attraction of passing interest into a regional force , leveraging the influx of young families into a favorable demographic . " We 're part of the metro area , part of the party . " // Moreno has revealed good sense elsewhere too . When he asked for an owner 's suite to be built , workers wondered where he wanted the clubhouse phone . " Are you serious ? " Moreno asked . " Have you ever seen the size of Mike Scioscia ? " His refusal to meddle is rooted in more than fear of Scioscia 's wrath . It reflects his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was ridiculed when I extended his contract so early , " Moreno says . And he plans to extend it at every opportunity . " When Mike leaves , I 'll probably leave , " he says . // The community gets to decide on its love affairs , and it seems that Moreno 's and Scioscia 's efforts are now being somewhat requited . About 40,000 people materialize every night , and at least some of them used to go to Dodgers games . As far as we know , they 're going just for the baseball . You get the same Farmer John dogs either place .
