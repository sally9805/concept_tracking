Section : #1 Company If Dan Weinfurter , founder of America 's fastest-growing private company , seems unfazed by what he 's up against , there 's a good reason . He 's spent a long time preparing for it <p> On the surface , it 's not immediately clear what makes Dan Weinfurter the ideal person to be running Parson Group LLC . <p> Even though he founded the Chicago-based business , which supplies high-level financial acumen to big companies , he 's not especially keen on crunching numbers . " I ca n't even balance my checkbook , " claims Weinfurter , 43 . And though he serves as CEO , he 's not a pushy , pumped-up type . Mindy Meade , the company 's marketing director , says a mutual acquaintance summed up her boss best . " He said , ' He 's the only type B CEO you 'll ever meet , ' " she recalls . <p> Yet Weinfurter , the nonfrenetic nonaccountant , feels perfectly suited to lead his employees , who now number 800 . That 's because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he is in how Parson does it  --  namely , grow at a supersonic rate . In the past five years , the company 's revenues have swelled a staggering 27,992% , with sales skyrocketing from $200,000 to $56 million . That puts Parson Group , which until 1998 was known as Current Assets LLC , at the head of this year 's Inc. 500 class . <p> Weinfurter , in fact , likely knows as much as there is to know about all-out , full-throttle growth . Seven years ago he served as vice-president of operations at a company that cracked the top 20 on Inc. ' s annual list . Alternative Resources Corp. , an information-technology staffing company , ranked #13 on the 1993 Inc. 500 . ( In 1994 it slid to the 140th spot . ) At Alternative Resources he spotted a wide-open niche for a staffing business focused on accounting . He knew enough to move in fast , and he 's never stopped moving . Geographically , Parson Group has already expanded to serve 15 cities . Strategically , Weinfurter has worked decisively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-end staffing and operations support to more sophisticated ( and higher-margin ) consulting services . " There are tons of opportunities out there , " declares the Milwaukee-born Weinfurter in his signature understated fashion . " What we 've done well is pick the right ones . " <p> DAN WEINFURTER KNEW JUST WHAT TO DO when he faced a clogged-up accounting system : he sat down and wrote a one-page outline for a business plan . <p> At the time Weinfurter was four years into his five-year stint at Alternative Resources . He had joined the staffing company in October 1989 , a year after its launch . Working at a breakneck clip , Weinfurter supervised the opening of offices in 30 new markets during the next five years and established himself as an effective leader . " He 's got a quiet leadership style that makes people intuitively trust him , " recalls Wayne Bock , a former vice-president at Alternative Resources . <p> He also inspires productivity . By 1994 , when the company went public , revenues had soared to more than $94 million . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system was n't equipped to handle the stringent new reporting requirements . Weinfurter watched as staffers scrambled to meet the deadlines . " I could see the struggles , " he says . " It really impacted the operation . " It also spurred his imagination . <p> At the time there were dozens of IT companies that were offering general systems staffing and consulting support , Weinfurter recalls . There were also companies , like Accountemps , whose main specialty was supplying clerical staffing help for accounting departments . But when it came to offering sophisticated assistance with budget analysis or a quick stand-in for a departing controller or  --  as in Alternative Resources ' case  --  someone who could overhaul an entire accounting system , Weinfurter found few places to turn . He saw an opening in the middle of the market between Accountemps and the then &shy; Big Six accounting firms . His strategy would be to offer seasoned professionals who could provide sophisticated accounting and finance operations support and project management to large companies . <p> The timing , he could see , was right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments with severely stripped-down staffs . By the mid-1990s , chief financial officers were fast warming up to the idea of bringing in outside accountants and other professionals to help ease the strain . As the economy gathered steam , their need for outside help only grew . " The market was out there for it , " says Tim Molloy , founder of Integrated Financial Temporaries Inc. , a six-year-old Chicago company that places accounting and financial professionals . " They could n't get people fast enough . " <p> Weinfurter got a quick boost for his start-up plan in the fall of 1994 , just as he was preparing to leave Alternative Resources . The husband of one of his salespeople introduced him to two venture capitalists , Samuel P. Chapman and J. Jeffry Louis . And in January 1995 the pair met Weinfurter for breakfast at Mitchell 's Original , a venerable North Side diner , to hear his business strategy . <p> Chapman and Louis took an instant liking to Weinfurter 's rsum : a proven track record at Alternative Resources , plus an additional 11 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw real potential in his plan . " What was interesting was that we were talking about carving out a whole new niche , " recalls Louis . " When we looked to see who else was doing it , there was no one out there . " <p> Chapman and Louis , who had started a venture-capital boutique called Parson Capital Corp. , wound up supplying $7.2 million during the company 's first two years . Weinfurter himself put up another $800,000 for a total start-up fund of $8 million . But the investors supplied much more than just capital . They spent several weeks vetting Weinfurter 's strategy with area executives . They then helped Weinfurter lay out a detailed business plan . <p> What 's more , once it became clear that the plan was a go , Louis and Chapman drew on a wide network of contacts in the local business community and assembled an outside board of directors . Among the high-profile members : Jerry Pearlman , the former chairman and CEO of Zenith Electronics Corp. ; Donald Perkins , the former chairman of Jewel Cos. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Chapman 's father , Alger , vice-chairman of global-banking giant ABN AMRO . <p> The board operates much as it would at a public company : it convenes to hear quarterly reports from Weinfurter , and it has the power to remove him if the company 's performance flags . In Weinfurter 's view the discipline of having to report to the board has actually helped him keep the company focused . Plus , he says , the board has supplied lots of valuable advice . <p> When Current Assets was officially launched , in July 1995 , competition was beginning to stir in the high-end accounting-staffing market . But Weinfurter took a couple of critical steps to differentiate the company . For one , unlike many other staffing firms , Current Assets decided not to pitch its employees as potential permanent hires . " If you 're trying to build a professional-services firm , you want to keep your best people , " says Weinfurter . " Why encourage clients to hire them away ? " <p> In addition , Current Assets consciously steered clear of handling tax returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company into more direct competition with the top accounting firms and would have required paying far steeper costs for professional-liability insurance . Keeping overhead down would , in turn , allow the company to offer its customers more competitive pricing . Current Assets , however , still had to sell that proposition to the accounting world . <p> One primitive prospecting tool was a list of CFOs at Chicago-area Fortune 1,000 companies . Roberta Hancock , an account manager who was one of Weinfurter 's first hires , vividly remembers working her way down that list , making cold call after cold call to try to set up introductory meetings . " It was really a lot of perseverance , " she recalls . <p> Of course , the company also had its high-profile board of directors , and from the start it leveraged board members ' contacts and reputations to woo customers . Louis recalls that at early sales meetings he and Weinfurter always brought along the brochure that listed the board of directors . " It really gave us instant credibility , " Louis says . <p> Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of the Chicago area 's biggest companies . Plus , the company 's efforts to build on connections that Chapman and a handful of company employees had with partners at major accounting firms were starting to pay off . It began landing referrals for work that the then &shy; Big Six firms were precluded from handling because of auditor independence issues . Big Five referrals now account for roughly 10% of the company 's revenues . " For any firm that 's trying to grow , " Weinfurter says , " partnerships have to be a huge part of the strategy . " <p> JUST AS CRITICAL , THE CEO BELIEVED from the start , was the company 's ability to expand quickly . Having identified a relatively wide-open niche , he wanted to get off the ground in Chicago and then quickly establish a national presence . " Ultimately , what we do is not rocket science , " says Nelson Head , senior vice-president of operations . Soon others in the industry " would have decided that we have a really cool strategy , so we pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , Weinfurter chose Minneapolis , a relatively small market that had the added advantage of being fairly close to Chicago , as the company 's second office . But from the start " we had real struggles , " recalls Weinfurter . Part of the trouble , he says , was that Minneapolis " tends to be a little more parochial " than Chicago . <p> In hindsight , though , the bigger problem was that the new office manager was " the wrong person for the job , " he says . That manager , whom Weinfurter had hired through a newspaper ad , was replaced in late 1995 . Minneapolis is now the company 's seventh-largest market , behind Chicago , Boston , Dallas , New York City , Atlanta , and Stamford , Conn . <p> The problems in Minneapolis taught Weinfurter a valuable lesson . From the start he wanted to expand into the top 20 markets in the country . After Minneapolis , he decided that the order in which offices opened did n't matter . When the company found the right leader in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled out . Thus in March 1996 , when an account manager at Alternative Resources agreed to open an office in Dallas , the company was launched there . Likewise , in August of that year , when Weinfurter found a good candidate in Boston , he opened an office there . <p> Weinfurter still counts recruiting as his chief priority . Both he and VP Head typically travel at least two days a week , talking to top managerial candidates at the various Parson offices . " Getting on a plane every week gets old , " says Weinfurter . " But for now , anyway , it 's crucial . One weak link can hurt you in a pretty big way . You 'd absolutely better find good people . " <p> To do that , he and other managers like to tout the idea that Parson Group offers an appealing alternative career path . At Big Five firms and large corporations , they note , accountants typically have to wait years before being made a partner or rising up the corporate ladder . At Parson Group , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all kinds of chances to move up quickly in the ranks  --  from working on increasingly complex consulting projects to heading up Parson 's offices . ( And , Weinfurter says , employees also do n't have to travel constantly since most of the company 's work is local . ) <p> Weinfurter has done everything he can think of to identify potential job candidates in new markets . This year the company even held a raffle as an extra reward for staffers who 'd brought in employees . The winner got a Mazda Miata . <p> Of course , the fact that Parson Group now offers the vast majority of its new employees a full-time salary , instead of hourly rates for projects , as well as equity in the company , also helps with recruiting . And the company can now point to a long list of blue-chip clients , as well as a dazzling growth rate . Indeed , Weinfurter chuckles as he recounts what one recent job candidate in the company 's new San Francisco office told him about why she wanted to work there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable company , " he says . <p> But to Weinfurter , Parson Group still feels like a start-up . <p> AND IN AT LEAST ONE FUNDAMENTAL WAY , it still is a start-up . After all , the staffing company that was launched only five years ago as Current Assets has since adopted a new strategy and a new name . <p> The moment of decision came three years ago . It started , in part , with the discovery that a staffing business in California was using the term current assets in its marketing materials . At the same time , Weinfurter and other company execs were looking out on a more crowded accounting-staffing field . With the entry of new players , including staffing giant Robert Half International Inc. , and the rise of Internet headhunting sites , the battle for market share was bound to get fiercer . <p> Weinfurter , among others , concluded that it made no sense to continue investing in a model focused on staffing . " We felt like we should be moving in the opposite direction , " recalls Head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step up its efforts to attract higher-end consulting projects . By then Weinfurter had also made up his mind that it was n't worth battling over the company 's name and opted for Parson Group . ( Weinfurter says the name , borrowed from the venture capitalists , sounds more like a consulting business anyway . ) <p> Since then , the company has raised a fresh $6-million infusion of capital from Chicago-based Banc One Equity Capital and has been investing heavily in developing higher-end practice areas , including mergers-and-acquisitions integration , risk management , and enterprise resource planning . And though Parson says it 's committed to maintaining a healthy staffing business , it 's billing itself as a consulting-services company in new markets like Houston and San Francisco . <p> It 's a risky strategy . Overhead , for instance , has shot up , now that the company  --  in its bid to build a stable , high-quality consulting force  --  is bringing in most new hires as full-time employees . Moreover , it 's not entirely certain that all the service areas Parson Group is investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to predict the exact mix of what clients will need , " says Weinfurter . <p> Even so , he insists that the repositioning is actually " a very natural evolution . " From the very start , he says , customers had been asking Parson employees to handle more complicated projects . Already about half the company 's revenues come from consulting work , according to Weinfurter . And he expects that consulting will account for at least three-quarters of its revenues by the end of 2001 . <p> In the meantime , Weinfurter has been meeting with investment bankers who are hungry to take the company public . That could happen , he assures them  --  just not right now . " Lots of firms get hurt by going public too soon , " says the man who lived through the IPO at Alternative Resources . " Right now we 're not ready . We 're not of a size where we think it makes sense . " <p> But it will be , if Weinfurter 's projections pan out . By 2001 he 's forecasting revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parson Group wants to earn as much as $500 million in revenues . All in all , it 's shaping up to be a much more massive operation than even Weinfurter envisioned . But as a " type B CEO , " he 's taking the growth in stride . " You think it 's going to work , but yoFu really do n't know , " he says . " This has worked far better and faster than anyone anticipated .
