<p> Death Row at San Quentin State Prison is an antiseptic form of hell , nearly devoid of the things , like intimacy and love , that give life value . <p> Living here is a numbing gray slog for the 647 condemned killers who sit , year after year , waiting to die on the nation 's most populous death row . <p> Behind the prison 's granite walls , quarried by inmates more than 150 years ago , is a stark environment of concrete floors and clanging cell doors . It is a monotonous , controlled , alternately boring and spooky place that echoes with the shouts of lost souls . <p> This world , with its lime green execution chamber looming in everyone 's consciousness , is the destination for those deemed unsuitable to ever again step foot in the civilized world . Yet , there is a civilization inside San Quentin , where hopes still survive amid the hopelessness . <p> " Human beings will always make the best situation that they can for themselves in any kind of situation , " said prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer at San Quentin . <p> The scheduled execution of Stanley " Tookie " Williams on Dec. 13 has focused international attention on San Quentin 's Death Row and the battle over its replacement . The California Department of Corrections wants to spend $233 million on a new facility with 768 cells , a project death penalty opponents and Marin County officials would like to prevent . <p> Williams , 51 , a co-founder of the Crips gang in Los Angeles , was sentenced to death for murdering a convenience store clerk in Whittier ( Los Angeles County ) and two motel owners and their daughter during robberies in 1979 . <p> After eight years on Death Row , he renounced gangs and wrote the first of nine books warning children against the gang life . He has been nominated repeatedly by supporters for Nobel Prizes . <p> His case has become a rallying cry for those who believe rehabilitation should count for something , preferably a commutation of his sentence . <p> Williams is one of three Death Row inmates whose executions are anticipated this winter . Fresno County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the oldest condemned prisoner , has a tentative execution date of Jan. 17 , the day after his 76th birthday . Michael Morales , a convicted murderer from Lodi , is expected to be given an execution date soon . <p> Execution is not the usual fate of Death Row inmates . On average , those who are executed spend 16 years in prison before they get a date with " the needle . " So far , there have been 11 executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1978 . Twelve condemned inmates have committed suicide and some 30 have died of natural causes during that time . <p> " I 've found that living a life of inactivity and non-productivity makes some inmates desire the sweet taste of death , " Crittendon said . " I 've talked with several who have said they would not appeal their death sentences . " <p> The Death Row population is increasing by about 30 inmates a year . The quality of their lives is dictated by a prison caste system unique to San Quentin . <p> There are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates are housed in the original Death Row , built in 1934 . Called North-Segregation , this quiet cell block houses the privileged class , those inmates who get along with other prisoners and do n't cause trouble . <p> Williams is a North-Seg resident . So is Richard Wade Farley , the bespectacled 57-year-old convicted killer of seven people during a 1988 rampage in Sunnyvale . <p> " This is my retirement plan , " Farley said wryly , as he sat behind a wire mesh fence playing chess in the cell block hallway with another inmate last year . <p> About 415 less fortunate condemned inmates live in the East Block , a crumbling , leaky maze of a place built in 1927 . It is a giant five-story cage , echoing with the incessant chatter and shrieking cacophony of prison . <p> David Carpenter , the infamous " Trailside Killer , " is an East Block inhabitant . At 75 , Carpenter , a convicted serial killer who terrorized hiking trails in Marin and Santa Cruz counties in the early 1980s , is the second-oldest prisoner on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children 's throats , banged their kids ' heads against the wall and killed them , " Crittendon said , describing the types of people who inhabit the cells . <p> But even among the condemned , moral distinctions are made . <p> When Robert Alton Harris was being led away to his execution in 1992 , Crittendon said , the inmates yelled " baby killer , " and taunted him with references to his decision to eat the unfinished hamburgers left behind by his murder victims . <p> The prison code exists even in the Adjustment Center , where the " worst of the worst " are held under heavy guard and in isolation . These inmates get their exercise in 8-by-10-foot cages watched over by gun-wielding guards . <p> The Adjustment Center is where Richard Allen Davis has lived since he was convicted for the kidnap and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas in Petaluma in 1993 . Davis has been assaulted and spat upon by other inmates at least three times . Besides killing a child , many inmates blame Davis for the three strikes law . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they get a chance , will attempt to kill him , " said Lt. Michael Barker , who is in charge of the unit . <p> Richard Ramirez , the satanic killer known as the " Night Stalker , " is also in the Adjustment Center , where he has continued to receive fan mail from adoring women even while exposing himself to children in the prison 's visiting area , according to Barker . <p> Details like that quickly spread among the inmates on Death Row , where there are few secrets . Prison officials marvel at the ability of inmates to pass on even the tiniest bits of overheard conversation from guards , prisoners and guests . <p> " The inmate network system is incredible , " Barker said . " They are ingenious in the way they get information . " <p> Despite the bleakness , humanity is still evident on Death Row . The inmates spend most of their time reading , playing chess or basketball , going to church or taking college courses . <p> " I have a lot of hope , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death Row last year . " They could abolish the death penalty . " <p> Many condemned inmates actually have Web sites from which they solicit pen pals , including Moon , who claims on his Web site to have found God and been forgiven . <p> San Quentin was completed in 1854 as California 's first penitentiary . It was built on land purchased for $10,000 just 30 years after a Licatuit Indian chief named Quentin was defeated there by Mexican soldiers . <p> The rudimentary prison , complete with a dungeon and whipping post , was soon overcrowded with 300 swindlers and cutthroats drawn to San Francisco by the Gold Rush . <p> In 1891 , San Quentin and Folsom prisons were officially declared the state 's designated execution sites . <p> The first hanging at San Quentin was in 1893 . A total of 215 people were hanged there until 1937 , when the Legislature approved lethal gas in place of the noose as the state 's official method of execution . From then on , San Quentin was the only place in California where executions could occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gassed . That unfortunate group includes one of the inmates who helped weld the gas chamber together when it arrived in pieces from the manufacturer 68 years ago . <p> The inmate , who welded the chamber 's roof and side walls , was released and eventually got himself arrested for murder . In 1945 , he was marched into the chamber he had helped build , his expert welds plainly visible as he took his final breath , Crittendon said . <p> It was n't long after that execution that a double-jointed inmate wriggled free of his restraints inside the gas chamber . Crittendon said the warden , fearing what might happen next , ordered the execution to continue . As horrified witnesses watched , the man ran around frantically inside the chamber trying to escape the lethal fog before he finally collapsed and died , curled up in a corner , Crittendon said . <p> Nine people have been executed by lethal injection since 1995 , when the gas chamber was ruled cruel and unusual punishment . But " the big jab , " as the inmates call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its infamous welds visible to this day . <p> Many of San Quentin 's original buildings are still in use , including the old dungeon , where the torturous isolation cells are now used for storing evidence . <p> Corrections officials insist the prison is so dilapidated and overcrowded that a new Death Row must be built if California is going to continue holding condemned inmates at San Quentin . <p> As it is , the inmates are so dispersed around the prison that double or triple escorts are sometimes needed to move inmates from one place to another , often around blind corners and through less-secure areas , increasing the likelihood of trouble . <p> A few years ago , gang members were foiled in an elaborate plan to take over the Adjustment Center . One of the leaders , Paul " Roscoe " Tuilaepa , reportedly told prison officials after he was captured that the intent was never to escape . " We just wanted to kill every guard we could get our hands on , " he said . <p> Safety measures have been taken since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a program that places prisoners in compatible groups during exercise . <p> Although the prison is safer than it was in the 1970s and 1980s , according to Crittendon , death is always lurking . <p> " Human life is very fragile , " he said , defining the one overriding fact of life on Death Row .
