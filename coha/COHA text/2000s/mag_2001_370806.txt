In this sub-ordinary sequel to the entertaining 1998 hit , a don't-invite-'em pair of cops  --  the serious one ( Jackie Chan ) from Hong Kong , the shrill one ( Chris Tucker ) from L.A.  --  do battle against malefactors of nearly every race . It 's good to see Zhang Ziyi , the high-flying ingenue from Crouching Tiger , in a dragon-lady role , and fetching Roselyn Sanchez as a woman of uncertain loyalties . But until a vigorous climax , the action scenes have little punch . The film seems content to rely on the formula that could ( small sigh ) extend for a few more sequels : Jackie kicks butt ; Chris kicks sass . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
