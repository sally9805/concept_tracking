Cool Revolution kate talkingtree sat meditating in a large hall that was surrounded by redwood trees . Although the deep shade of the trees usually kept the room quite cool , today was unseasonably warm and Kate , with everybody else , was beginning to perspire . They had been meditating , on and off their cushions , for most of the morning , beginning at five-thirty when they roused themselves , at the sound of the bell , from their beds . When they broke from meditating inside , they quietly made their way outside and into the courtyard . Up and down the path that led to the front door of the hall they did a walking meditation that had been taught them by a lot of different Buddhist teachers , some from America and some from Asia . It was a slow , graceful meditation that she liked ; she enjoyed the feeling of a heel touching the earth long before a toe followed it . Meditating this way made her feel almost as slow as vegetation ; it went well with her new name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever since she was small shed felt a wary futility about talking . At the same time she realized it was something that , in order for the world to understand itself at all , had to be done . Her old last name had been Nelson , and for a time shed thought of calling herself Kate Nelson-Fir . She loved fir trees , especially the magnificent , towering ones that grew on the Northwest coast . When it was time for the dharma talk to begin Kate made her way to a spot close enough to see and hear the teacher very easily . He was a middle-aged man of southern European descent , with an ecru complexion and a shining bald head . His brown eyes twinkled as he talked . Every once in a while he reached up and stroked the silver earring in his left ear . Because of the earring and because he seemed spotless in his flowing robes , she mentally dubbed him Mr. Clean . She had been coming to his talks every day for more than a week , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the misguided notion that a hot revolution , with guns and violence , such as the ones attempted in Africa , Cuba , and the Caribbean , could ever succeed . He seemed unaware that these revolutions had been undermined not only by their own shortcomings but also by military interference from the United States . The only revolution that could possibly succeed , he maintained , smiling , was the cool one introduced to the world by the Lord Buddha , twenty-five hundred years ago . Something about this statement did not sit well with Kate . She looked at him carefully . He was certainly a well-fed-looking soul , she thought . Not many meals missed by that one , except by accident . Quietly glancing down at the program on the floor beside her , she saw he had grown up in an upper-middle-class home , had had educated and cultured people as parents and as grandparents , had studied and lived in Europe as well as in the East . Was now a prominent professor at one of the countrys most famous universities . Easy enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor white people all over the globe who worried constantly where their next meal was coming from , she thought . How they would feed , clothe , and educate their children . Who , if they did sit down to meditate , would probably be driven up again by the lash . Or by military death squads , or by hunger , or by . . . the list was long . Looking around her she noticed most of the meditators shared the teachers somewhat smug , well-fed look . They were overwhelmingly white and middle- to upper-middle-class and had the money and leisure time to be at a retreat . In fact , she noted , she seemed to be the only person of color there . What was wrong with this picture ? Her mind , which had been clear as a reflecting pool just minutes before , now became cloudy . This was exactly what meditation was meant to prevent . She took a deep breath , labeled her thoughts thinking , as shed been instructed to do if her mind wandered during meditation , and settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this teacher , whom she indeed respected very much , and she would not be critical . Besides , she knew what he meant . There was a way in which all hot revolutions defeated themselves , because they spawned enemies . Look at those crazy ex-Cubans in Miami , for instance , who never recovered from having some of their power taken away , and the endless amount of confusion , pain , and suffering they caused . After the talk she began to think in earnest . She felt she had reached an impasse on the Buddhist road . That evening and the next day and the next she found herself unable to meditate . She kept looking out the window instead , just as she had looked out of the window of the Church of God and Christ , as a child , when she had been unable to believe human beings , simply by being born , had sinned . The redwood trees looked so restful , their long branches hanging down to the earth . Each tree created a little house , a shelter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit . She had nt realized this before , how thoughtful this was . But on her very next walking meditation she slowly , slowly , made her way to the largest redwood tree and sat under it , becoming invisible to the dozens of people who continued their walking meditation and slowly walked all around her . When everybody else returned to the meditation hall , she did not . From the Hardcover edition .
