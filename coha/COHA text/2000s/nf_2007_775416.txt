Introduction // The narrative sections of this book document a journey to a remarkable place : an isolated Middle Eastern village whose inhabitants " speak " sign language  --  a language unlike any other in the world , witnessed by few outsiders and never before described . For the last several years , a team of four linguists , two from the United States and two from Israel , has been working in the village , documenting this extraordinary language and , little by little , deciphering it . In the summer of 2003 , I was granted the immense privilege of accompanying the team on a three-day research trip to the village . To my knowledge , I am the only journalist from outside the region who has ever been there . // From the time the linguists first set foot in the village , they have striven ferociously to protect the privacy of the people they are studying . That is their job . Before they could even begin their fieldwork , the team spent many painstaking months earning the trust of the villagers . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of this book , the linguists felt , with ample justification , that the presence of any newcomer , much less a journalist , had the potential to capsize their entire endeavor . Because of this , I acceded to more constraints on my reporting than I normally would . These were arrived at in the course of nearly a year of transatlantic negotiations with the team 's leader , Dr. Wendy Sandler of the University of Haifa , as I sought permission to make the trip . // During my time in the village I was , by prearrangement , a mostly silent observer of the linguists as they went about their work ; at no time was I allowed to interview the villagers independently . ( Given the breathtaking gulf between their native language and mine , this would have been no small trick anyhow . ) Although the linguists continue to make regular research trips to the village , I was permitted to go along only this once . All of the scenes described in the narrative , and all of the dialogue , I saw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only exception is the tale of the larcenous mice , which I have reconstructed based on an interview with the victim . My descriptions of the history and daily life of Al-Sayyid are based on my own observations , and on interviews with members of the research team . // There were other conditions . In exchange for permission to accompany the team , I agreed to show Dr. Sandler all portions of my manuscript pertaining to Al-Sayyid . Because of the exquisite cross-cultural sensitivity their work demands , the linguists are ethically obliged  --  and , by extension , so am I  --  not to disclose certain personal details about the life and inhabitants of Al-Sayyid that they have learned in the course of their visits . In the end , I chose to show the entire manuscript to Dr. Sandler as well as to the three other linguists on her team , Drs . Irit Meir , Carol Padden and Mark Aronoff . I have welcomed their corrections on matters of fact , their clarifications of technical material , and their suggestions for avenues of further inquiry . Matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as do any residual errors . // Dr. Sandler also expressed deep concern that with the publication of my book , this insular , traditional community might be overrun with curiosity-seekers and members of the news media . In keeping with the linguists ' own practice , standard for this type of anthropological research , I have changed the name of every villager mentioned in the narrative . I have also disguised the precise location of the village , along with certain other identifying details . Consider Al-Sayyid a kind of signing Brigadoon ( although it is very real , and I have seen it ) , a place utterly impossible for any outsider to find . I trust strongly that none will try . // In one other instance in the narrative , the brief account in Chapter 7 of a scholar who is said to make scientific generalizations about a language that " only he speaks , " certain identifying details have been changed to protect the individual 's privacy . // In recent decades , the field of sign-language linguistics has established itself as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As such , it is awash in competing scholarly opinions . In a book written for a general readership , it is impossible to give an exhaustive account of either the historical development of the discipline or its present state of affairs . What this book offers is an introduction to the linguistic study of sign language in the form of a representative cross section of the field and its preoccupations from its beginnings in the 1960s to the present day . It is a slice  --  one of many possible slices  --  of sign-language linguistics at the start of the twenty-first century , and is by no means intended to represent the field in toto . A bibliographic essay at the end of the book offers suggestions for further reading . // Some notes on usage : Anyone who writes about deafness quickly discovers that worlds of meaning , politics and identity hang on the capitalization of a single letter : the initial " d " of the word " deaf . " In the United States , it is often customary to capitalize " Deaf " when referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united by common language and traditions , of people who can not hear . ( The word is lowercased when it refers strictly to the audiological condition . ) After much deliberation , I have chosen to keep the word " deaf " lowercased throughout the pages of this book . My only motivation is typographic consistency , in particular as it applies to the discussions of Al-Sayyid , where capital-D concepts like " Deaf culture " and " Deaf power " are unknown by virtue of the fact that it is so utterly ordinary to be deaf there . I have , however , retained the original capitalization of the word in all quoted matter . // When one is writing about sign language , verbs of attribution also grow thorny . On a physiological level , no one " speaks " sign language , or ever " says " anything in sign . Sign languages have users . They have signers . But , technically , do n't have speakers . A work of this length , however , begs for stylistic variety , and as a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " say , " " talk "  --  along with their derivatives , to refer to the act of signed communication , as in the title of the book itself . These words are meant purely as loose , colloquial metaphors , to be understood much as " spoke " is in the title of the anthropologist Nora Groce 's lovely book , Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language . // In a book about cognitive science , the terms " mind " and " brain " also pose a challenge to smooth usage . I have in general adopted the familiar " hardware-versus-software " analogy , using " brain " to refer to the physical structure within the cranial cavity and " mind " to denote the range of operations this physical structure can perform . // Talking Hands is organized into seventeen chapters . The odd-numbered chapters form the narrative of the linguists ' visit to Al-Sayyid and their subsequent work deciphering its language . The even-numbered chapters chart the course of sign-language linguistics : Chapters 2 and 4 offer an introduction to the signed languages of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 and 8 chronicle the birth of the scientific study of sign language , and examine the very special conditions that give rise to " signing villages " like Al-Sayyid . Chapters 10 and 12 describe the grammar of signed languages , focusing on the unusual means by which they build words and sentences . Chapters 14 and 16 explore the psychology of sign language  --  memory for signs , " slips of the hand , " and so on  --  and what sign language has to tell us about the neurological workings of human language in the brain . // Finally , a note on sign-language transcription . Following the convention of sign-language linguistics , the English glosses for signs are printed in small capital letters : FATHER , ROOSTER , THINK . Where a single sign is glossed using two or more English words , they are linked with hyphens : YOUNGER-BROTHER , TAKE-CARE-OF , LEFT-SIDE . Compound signs are glossed with a ligature mark : THRILLINFORM . Words spelled out by means of the manual alphabet are capitalized and hyphenated : W-A-T-E-R. // Text copyright ? 2007 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
