Once upon a time , There was a little boy named Christopher who lived with his parents and his sister in a beautiful green valley in some very tall mountains . They were poor but very happy . Christopher loved to read fantasy stories about knights and wizards and dragons , and one day he decided to write a fantasy story of his own . People loved Christopher 's story , so much that everyone wanted a copy . Suddenly Christopher 's family was n't so poor anymore . <P> Strange as it sounds , that particular fantasy story happened . Its hero is Christopher Paolini , a real-life home-schooled kid who lives with his family in a remote valley in the Absaroka Mountains of Montana . When he was 15 , Paolini wrote a fantasy novel called Eragon , which has sold 2.5 million copies . And it was n't a fluke : Paolini , who is now a ripe old 21 , has written a sequel to Eragon called Eldest ( Knopf ; 681 pages ) , due out this week . The adventure continues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Paolini is  --  just a little . He 's handsome and slight of build , with messy dark hair and glasses ; people say he looks like Harry Potter . His voice is on the high side , and he tends to overarticulate . It would be only slightly unfair to compare him with the Simpsons character Martin Prince . His hobbies include making his own medieval weaponry . " I 've been working on a chain-mail hauberk , " he says , walking in the mountains above his parents ' house . ( He carries a wooden stick in case he runs into a rattlesnake . ) " I need to get back on that . " He weighs in on the virtues of alternating welded and riveted links in chain mail . He 's the kind of Christopher you ca n't really imagine ever calling Chris . <P> Eragon is your basic boy-meets-dragon story . The titular hero is a teenage boy who finds a strange blue stone that turns out to be an egg . The egg hatches into a beautiful , powerful and somewhat sassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond . It 's an irresistible premise : she 's exactly the kind of perfect friend a smart , lonely mountain boy would invent for himself , although Paolini does n't feel as though he missed out on anything growing up in Montana . " I do n't think I 'd have written anything like I did if I did n't live here , if I 'd been engaged in a lot of other , scripted activities  --  soccer and football and whatever else the case might be , " he says . Take that , all you smug promgoers . <P> Being a prodigy is n't always easy . When Paolini 's parents realized they had a teen Tolkien on their hands , they quit their jobs , published Eragon themselves and put Paolini on a grueling tour schedule , from junior high to junior high , library to library . He became the family breadwinner . " As the saying goes , we really bet the farm , " Paolini says . " It was down to the point where if we did n't sell enough books , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that a lot of pressure for a teenager ? " You have no idea , " Paolini says . " Even though I was home schooled , I have been in more schools now than any person should ever be forced to go into . And I did do most of those events in medieval costume . It will take some extraordinary event to ever get me back in that thing . "
