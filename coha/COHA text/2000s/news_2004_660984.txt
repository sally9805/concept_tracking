<p> An ill wind is blowing through the Pechanga tribe . Sure , there have been problems before . A land dispute here , a water crisis there . But nothing like what 's happening now . Elders nod coldly when they see one another at tribal gatherings . Certain kids are ostracized at the reservation playground , and housewives shuffle quickly down the aisles at Albertsons supermarket without as much as a howdy . <p> It all started sometime in late 2002 . Rumors were heard , allegations were made , lineages were scrutinized , voices were raised , and , at the end of it all , the enrollment committee moved to throw some 130 members out of the 1,200-strong tribe . <p> The members targeted are hopping mad . " They did it to our face , " says John Gomez Jr. , one of the plaintiffs in the suit filed two months ago against members of the tribal enrollment committee . " They presented a memo saying there are ' issues ' about our ancestor Manuela Miranda . False and absurd ! We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , full membership requires proof of lineal descent from an original Pechanga member and a family line contained in the official enrollment book . Mr. Gomez and other plaintiffs trace their lineage to Manuela Miranda - granddaughter of undisputed Pechanga headman Pablo Apish . Most of the plaintiffs have enjoyed full membership rights and lived on or around the reservation - in Temecula , Calif. - for more than 25 years . <p> But now , committee members say they have found that Ms. Miranda , who was , to begin with , only half Pechanga ( according to the US Bureau of Indian Affairs ) - moved off the reservation and cut her ties to the tribe 80 years ago . <p> " Cut her ties ? No . No and no , " insists Gomez , a paralegal who was fired from his job as legal assistant for the tribe when the debate flared . " At show-and-tell at elementary school I would bring in pictures of my Pechanga ancestors , " he says . Gomez grew up in northern California and moved to Temecula in 1997 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my dad and his cousins and their ' Indian tricks and games ' ... To have someone suddenly tell you , ' You are not Pechanga and you never were , ' is very hurtful . " <p> The threat of disenrollment is a grave insult , contend the aggrieved : It 's an insult to old family traditions , to ancient heritage , and to Pechanga pride . It 's also a major hit to the pocketbook . The members in question stand to lose more than $ 120,000 each a year in casino profits and bonuses , as well as health insurance and other benefits . <p> There have been membership disputes for as long as there have been members of tribes , say experts , but in recent years , with more money to fight over , and more funds with which to finance legal suits , such disputes - which would have played out quietly 10 years ago - are increasing : in number , in acrimony , and in the attention they grab . <p> Five years after California approved the law giving tribes exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some $ 4 billion a year , and more casinos are being planned all the time . The Pechanga tribe has a lavish resort and 2,000 slot-machine casino and nets an estimated $ 184 million annually . That money goes toward health , social , education , and housing programs , with a certain amount parceled out as individual stipends to every member . <p> Before the casino opened , the Pechanga tribe received about 15 to 30 applications a year from people seeking enrollment , according to tribal documents . These days , they are overwhelmed by more than 450 applications a year . The same story is repeated across the country . In response , many tribes are freezing their membership lists , or proceeding very carefully when it comes to those who seem to have suddenly " discovered " their heritage . <p> Facing disenrollment from the tribe <p> On the flip side of this story , hundreds of Indians - many of whom have for years considered themselves part of a tribe - have been ejected or are being disenrolled from their tribes since gambling began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Indian Movement , says that , today , about 2,000 Indians in California alone face disenrollment action . <p> " People are being voted out of their tribe and losing their identity so others can benefit from monies , " accuses Jon Velie , an attorney representing some of the disenrolled Pechanga . He charges that individuals on the enrollment committee are trying to consolidate political power , control the key leadership jobs , and then illegally increase their wealth by reducing the total number of tribal members eligible for shares of casino profits . <p> Mr. Velie 's defense of his clients ' Pechanga bloodline is to launch an offense - he charges that the enrollment committee members , many of whom are from the same extended family , are themselves the " iffy " members of the tribe . Their ancestors , he says , were adopted into the tribe and so have no right to call the kettle black . " It 's a classic case of non-Indians trying to kick the real Indians out , " he says , solemnly . <p> Tribal attorney Alex Baghdassarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterallegations . <p> So far , the California courts have followed the law that says tribes , as sovereign nations , are shielded from lawsuits filed against them in state or federal courts - and have refused to rule on the case or order a restraining order on the enrollment committee , as plaintiffs had demanded . But Riverside Superior Court Judge Charles Field did not throw out the case , as the tribe had demanded , indicating to some that he might take jurisdiction in the future , and raising eyebrows . <p> Gomez knows how hard it will be for an outside judge to interfere in tribal membership issues , but he holds out that this case might be an exception . The enrollment committee , he explains , has " acted outside the authority granted to them by the tribe , " and thus can no longer be protected by sovereign immunity . <p> " It 's just like saying - I do n't have to serve a black man because it 's my restaurant , " chimes in Velie . " States would argue that these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the enrollment committee members are also acting outside the law and illegally . So we can not rely on them to judge the case themselves . " Velie calls the judge 's decision to keep the case open a " significant , precedent-setting victory " for his clients . <p> Who decides tribal membership ? <p> But most Indian law experts are skeptical that in the long run the California court will step further into such swirling waters . <p> " Membership disputes go to the core of a tribe 's status and sovereignty , " says Colin Cloud Hampson , a San Diego lawyer specializing in federal Indian law . " The tribe should be the sole determiner of membership and the Supreme Court has upheld this setup . Californian courts are not well positioned to get involved . " <p> Carole Goldberg , an Indian law professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , agrees : " This is a case worth watching , " she says . " But I do n't see how a judge is going to legally interfere here . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an internal matter . " <p> Telling the tribe who to allow in would be like the United Nations dictating who should be considered American citizens , argues Pechanga Tribal Chairman Mark Macarro in a statement released last month . Mr. Macarro 's own cousin , Arlene Macarro Lloyd , incidentally , has been refused membership for years . " Decades of jurisprudence hold that enrollment matters ... are determined by tribal law and tradition , " says Macarro . <p> Meanwhile , as the dispute plays out , many in Temecula wonder if the tribe will ever be able to live peacefully together again . <p> When Gomez 's first son was born two years ago , he received flowers from the tribal council , he recalls . When his second son was born a month ago , there was nothing of the sort . He was fired from his tribal job while on paternity leave , he says . <p> " Money corrupts , " he concludes . " There are things which have occurred that I do n't think can heal . No matter how it ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
