<p> CONCERT PREVIEW <p> Atlanta Baroque Orchestra conducted by John Hsu. 3 p.m. today . Peachtree Road United Methodist Church , 3180 Peachtree Road N.E. , Atlanta . $15-$25 ; under 12 free . 770-537-3974 , www.atlantabaroque.org . <p> The boyish grin seems a permanent feature , but suddenly John Hsu looks nervous . He sits with his delicate hands folded neatly on his lap . Talking between a rehearsal and a fund-raising dinner , he 's sheepish about recounting the events of his life . <p> He 'd rather talk about his favorite violinist : an intense , poetic young woman named Ginette Neveu who made only a few extraordinary recordings and died , at age 30 , in a plane crash . <p> " She understood the ghost voices , " he says , a term he uses to describe the deepest of artistry . <p> He 'd rather talk of his uncle who studied in Paris in the 1930s and who knew Neveu , and was the first Chinese violinist to win the conservatory 's career-launching Premiere Prix . And he 's a chatterbox when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular 1991 French film " Tous Les Matins du Monde , " a fictionalized drama on the relationship between 17th-century viola da gamba virtuosos Jean de Sainte-Colombe and Marin Marais , an artist who has been Hsu 's scholarly focus . ( He found the film enjoyable but  --  long story  --  aesthetically flawed . ) <p> But when Hsu is pressed to reveal the decisive events that made him first a cellist , then a teacher , then an early-music scholar and , finally , a conductor of few frills but commanding insight and authority , he reaches for an understatement . <p> " I learned to do these things before I knew they were difficult , " he shrugs , and his grin relaxes . <p> At 75 , John Hsu ( pronounced shew ) is a full-time conductor , and he 's devoting himself to the Atlanta Baroque Orchestra . This afternoon , the period-instrument group performs at Peachtree Road United Methodist Church in Buckhead . <p> In award-winning CDs and intensely vital concerts , Hsu has proven himself one of the leading , if unheralded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magician , " says Nina Falk , a well-traveled violist who played in Hsu 's acclaimed Apollo Ensemble in the 1990s , a 15-member group dedicated strictly to middle-period Haydn symphonies . " It was pure John , " Falk recalls . " He picked an area where he could do his absolute best work and concentrate with a mixture of intense love , scholarly detachment and a joy in communicating . " <p> Falk adds that Hsu is " humble as a gentleman but a very strong , decisive leader  --  a rare combination . " <p> Finding a home <p> Loath to assess himself , Hsu mentions his youth , embedded in the extreme political turbulence of pre-Communist China . Born Hsu Tseng-Hsin in 1931 in Shantou , the country 's southernmost seaport , he calls his hometown a Chinese parallel to New Orleans , " a wild city , " rich in " diverse cultures and good food . " As Japanese troops forced Chinese slave laborers to construct the infamous Burma Road during the Sino-Japanese War , Hsu 's family fled the city , first to Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been peasants , " the poorest of the poor , " who were taken in by Presbyterian missionaries and converted to Christianity . Western influences gripped the family . Hsu 's father , with a booming musical voice and charisma , found his calling as a preacher . <p> " That 's where the music started , " Hsu says of weekly choir rehearsals in their home , giggling at the memory of European hymns sung in the Swatao dialect of Chinese . " When I was 7 or 8 , I 'd wait all week for Thursdays . That was my attraction to music . " <p> Shanghai proved a unique spot . After the Nazis barred public employment of Jews , many fled Germany . Most had no traveling papers and no passports ; those who could afford it boarded boats headed for America . When U.S. quotas of Jewish emigres filled up , these boats roamed the high seas , looking for a place to dock . <p> Shanghai , an open city , accepted the refugees . They were free to roam during the day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jews of Shanghai found security but no freedom , " as Hsu puts it . <p> Among them was a tiny man from Vienna known to Hsu 's family only as Herr Wolff . He accompanied the church choir and became Hsu 's first music theory teacher . " He barely spoke English , no Chinese , and he taught me advanced counterpoint using two words : ' good ' and ' bad , ' " Hsu recalls . " He could play and transcribe anything on the spot . He was magic . " <p> Another was Wolfgang Frankel , who 'd been a judge in Berlin . In Shanghai , unable to practice law , he redirected his sophisticated musical training to teach children . Hsu relates how " Frankel was a very profound man , on many subjects . He 'd talk about ' ghost voices ' in music , and how essential it was to first draw a skeleton  --  the harmonic and rhythmic structure embedded within a piece of music  --  and then draw the flesh around that skeleton . " <p> It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a life philosophy on priorities and values . " I hung onto that lesson , " Hsu says . <p> A third influence was Johan Kraus , who 'd been a cellist in the Berlin State Opera and later joined the San Francisco Symphony . In Shanghai , he taught Hsu and other beginning cellists . <p> In the maternal genes <p> On Hsu 's mother 's side , music had long flourished . Six of her siblings were musicians ; the eldest received a scholarship to study economics in Paris . He took two others in tow , including Ma Si-Tson , a violinist who was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire , won its top student prize and later returned to China as a leading virtuoso . <p> After the war , Hsu 's teachers recommended him to study in America . Carroll College in Waukesha , Wis. , was the only school to offer him a full scholarship . He entered the freshman class in 1949 . Within a year he was studying at Massachusetts ' Tanglewood Music Center , then as now an intensive summer boot camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exacting musician was taking shape . Back then , Arnold Schoenberg 's bitter and disorienting Third String Quartet was regarded as a pinnacle of abstract modernism ; few students had the chops to play it . <p> " Everyone wanted to know it , but no one could count it , it was rough going . But I could count it , " Hsu remembers , chuckling at the memory . " I did n't know how well Judge Frankel had prepared me ; I thought what I knew was basic . " <p> His training gave him a leg up . Entering the New England Conservatory the next year , he tested out of many classes , which gave him time to earn a living and gain experience as a freelance cellist  --  logging 700 miles a week across the Northeast . By 1955 , he beat out dozens of applicants for a professorship at Cornell ; he remained there until last year , marking a half-century of service . <p> Asian pioneers <p> Among Hsu 's students at Cornell was Paul Chihara , now a TV composer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier this season , arranged music for the Atlanta Ballet 's " The Great Gatsby . " As a music-theory student at Cornell in the 1960s , the pupil was just a few years younger than his teacher . <p> " Cornell was then a very gentlemanly place and race was never discussed , although as Asian-Americans there was a blatant  --  what we 'd consider patronizing  --  attitude toward us , " Chihara says . " It made us both uncomfortable . We 'd make jokes , not about white vs . Asian but Chinese vs . Japanese . We knew to keep it to ourselves . " <p> Times change : " Fifty years ago , I was the only Chinese teaching Western music at a major university in the U.S. , " Hsu offers . " At Cornell now , the whole violin section is Chinese or Korean . You 're looking at the future of classical music . " <p> Hsu had been at the university just a few years when Donald Grout , the most distinguished musicologist of his generation and Hsu 's department head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumental group to accompany madrigals . The early-music movement  --  playing music from before 1700 on authentically styled instruments and deploying the latest scholarship to help shape technique and interpretations  --  was then gaining momentum in the United States . <p> Grout offered to purchase a chest of viols  --  antiquated stringed instruments with frets  --  if Hsu would learn to play them . " I said , ' Sure . ' That 's how my life 's work got started , " Hsu says , recounting how he discovered the " fantastic " music of Marin Marais ( 1656-1728 ) . " As a scholar and a performer , I made him my business . " <p> It 's work that 's not gone unnoticed . The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians puts it this way : " A player of great refinement and masterly technique , Hsu is considered a leading exponent of the French solo viol literature . " Hsu also became the definitive player of an even more obscure instrument , the low-voiced baryton . <p> Atlanta focus <p> With his wife , Martha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , N.C. , on a waiting list for a retirement community . Although he gave his last baryton performance a decade ago , his energy has n't diminished . <p> He became Atlanta Baroque 's artistic director in 2004 , after vying with three other guest conductors who auditioned for the job . <p> His ABO debut was a knockout . " As soon as he conducted us , I was sold on him , " says Eckhart Richter , a founding cellist in the group and currently its president . The ensemble had been " floundering " in its attempts to replace founder Lyle Nordstrom , Richter admits . <p> " We had four strong candidates and though our interest in John Hsu was overwhelming , he put up a roadblock : He wanted to just work on musical matters , no administration . <p> " Doing both sides is a recipe for burnout , so we changed our bylaws , and that opened up the chance to get John . The board vote was unanimous . " <p> Since his debut , more than one musician in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , more energized , more musical . <p> That seems to be the audience consensus , too . When Hsu is conducting , says Gray Crouse , an avid concertgoer and Emory University biology professor , " the music has much more character and seems more alive than usual . You can tell from the sound , and also from the musicians ' faces . It 's quite impressive . " <p> ON ACCESSATLANTA.COM <p> What exactly is early music ?
