Tim Kincaid , an analyst at American Airlines , was tired of hearing about the wedding plans of the woman in the next cubicle . " You would have thought it was the Von Trapp wedding from The Sound of Music , " he recalls . But it rankled for reasons other than gossip overload . Kincaid was a closeted gay man , living under a " self-imposed silence . My assumption was , ' Do n't ask , do n't tell . ' " Although he was openly gay in the rest of his life , he was afraid to let anyone in hisoffice know . " I had worked a long time to get to this dream job , " he says . " I thought , Do I want to risk it ? I was really unsure of the atmosphere . " But Kincaid finally felt that he needed to come out to his boss . " I went in and said , ' I need to tell you something : I 'm gay . ' He was a busy guy , and multitasking while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listened . It was a powerful moment .
