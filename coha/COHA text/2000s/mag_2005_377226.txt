While Iowa may be a top destination for presidential candidates , the state has n't had as much luck wooing twentysomethings . In a 2000 Census study of which states attract the most young , single college grads , Iowa ranked 49th , flanked by the Dakotas ( with the northern one coming in dead last ) . Since then , Iowa has spent millions courting businesses and sprucing up communities with arenas , museums and river walks , but Hawkeye Republicans think they have come up with a more effective inducement for young college grads : exempting residents under the age of 30 from state income taxes . An economic plan unveiled by G.O.P. state senators to do just that would reduce state coffers by an estimated $200 million a year while saving the average 25-year-old about $600 . <P> Although senate Republican co-president Jeff Lamberti says he ca n't think of a " better way to send the message to young people that we want them , " his constituents are skeptical . Older voters complain that the proposed tax reprieve smacks of ageism , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice but ineffective . " As a taxpayer , yeah , I 'd like to save $1,000 or more , " says Adam Cooley , 23 , a recent grad working in Cedar Rapids . " But the job opportunities need to be there . " Voters in North Dakota agreed in 2002 , rejecting 2 to 1 a ballot initiative that would have offered young adults $2,000 a year in tax breaks and help with student loans . That outcome was inevitable , says North Dakota Republican Lieutenant Governor Jack Dalrymple . " Ask a 22-year-old , ' Are you interested in sticking around for our new tax break , or are you interested in a good job ? ' "
