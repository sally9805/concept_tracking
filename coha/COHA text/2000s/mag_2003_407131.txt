Three icons who 've changed the fashion landscape-Kate , Audrey and Madonna-and why they will always inspire us // In some ways , Katharine and Audrey Hepburn could n't be more different , except when it comes to their influence on fashion . For me , this was never more apparent than when I was putting this issue together . Audrey Hepburn was the first celebrity interview I ever published as an editor in chief , back in 1988 . I had always been in awe of her grace , compassion and her remarkable style , which embodied both European sophistication and American practicality . Fifteen years later , I found myself overcome with Audrey admiration once again , getting carried away at a charity auction in New York City in April for the Audrey Hepburn Children 's Fund . In a fit of excitement , I outbid Matt Lauer from the Today show for the late actress 's brown crocodile Kelly bag . Anyone who has a Kelly bag can relate to the joy you get just from owning it . And on top of it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of opera-length brown suede gloves sitting inside . " If the glove fits ... " as they say . This surprise could n't have come at a more appropriate time . Fashion is suddenly back to Audrey 's way of dressing : elegant and refined . I will certainly not keep my Kelly-or my gloves-under lock and key . Katharine Hepburn , who passed away as this issue was going to press , was also a great icon of style . She was my personal favorite-so empowering in her signature menswear looks . I never had the joy of meeting her , but I almost moved into her townhouse in Manhattan 's Turtle Bay neighborhood when I first arrived in New York from London . The house was so filled with her spirit , you could easily lose yourself in it , but , eventually , I decided not to take the place . Sometimes a dream is best left as just that . This season , I felt her menswear influence all over the runways-in shows that took place almost five months before her death and were conceived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know that her rule-breaking dressing will continue to inspire others for years to come . Neither of these women ever let trends get in the way of style and ease-Audrey was rarely seen without her signature ballet flats , and Katharine once dared men to wear skirts , citing that pants were a million times more comfortable . They never allowed themselves to suffer for fashion , unlike the women featured on page 296 who willingly put appearance before comfort , enduring tight corsets and towering stilettos in the name of glamour . Both stars wore designer labels but neither could ever be accused of looking like a fashion victim . On page 204 , we discuss how being overly enthusiastic about the latest trends can lead to a fashion faux pas , a misstep virtually unheard of for either Hepburn . There are few other modern women who define their time the way these actresses did , yet this month , we have one of them on our cover : Madonna . She is a pioneer of a different kind , never sticking to one look , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she first appeared on the fashion radar , and she continues to ignite trends . We highlight her greatest fashion hits on page 304 . I think you 'll agree with Jean Paul Gaultier who says , " Even when she rebels against fashion , it becomes fashion . " What 's more iconic than that ? Sidebar I 'd love to hear your thoughts on Harper 's Bazaar .
