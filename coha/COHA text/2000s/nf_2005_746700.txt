Section : Sociopolitical and Cultural Contexts <p> Healthy liberal democracies provide strong support for the agency of gifted and talented individuals . Agency entails the development of lofty aspirations , strong talents , and self-fulfillment over the long term . In contrast , totalitarian sociopolitical environments strongly suppress the agency of most citizens while supporting the ethically warped development of a few privileged insiders . A model of democratic growth and erosion , drawn from syntheses of scholarship from history , political theory , economics , sociology , and ethical philosophy , reveals some dynamics of large-scale contextual influences on the gifted and talented . Current trends toward ideological polarization and mass deception suggest that democratic erosion is jeopardizing the development of high ability individuals , particularly among disadvantaged populations . Educators of the gifted must become aware of discrepancies in epistemic power and the impact of empathy gulfs while striving to support the development of creative , ethical leadership . <p> More comprehensive understanding of giftedness and talent growth will be accessible once we explore the large-scale contexts that surround and shape the development of high ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classrooms and schools , currently enrich the gifted education literature . More in-depth explorations of the larger political , economic , and cultural worlds that support or suppress the development of individual abilities will lead to more accurate definitions of giftedness and talent , more defensible identification and selection processes for programming , and more efficient educational practices . <p> The nature of socioeconomic governance in a nation or region is a crucial target for contextual analyses because it strongly supports or constrains the development of individual aspirations and talents toward various forms of self-fulfillment . Socioeconomic contexts can provide enormous advantages for the talent development of some children and crushingly oppressive barriers hampering the development of others , depending on the ideological nature of the nations or regions in which they reside ( Ambrose , 2002 , 2003 ) . <p> This paper employs theory and research from the fields of political theory , history , economics , sociology , and ethical philosophy in the development of a model representing the large-scale sociopolitical contexts for talent development . The model integrates an ideological continuum with scholarly interpretations of political systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions of power in societies . It portrays optimal liberal democracy , which is a not-yet-attained ideal , as the best context for children 's talent development , and totalitarian systems as the worst contexts . It also reveals the dangers of democratic erosion , which occurs when citizens and policymakers are insufficiently diligent about maintaining widespread , deliberative participation . Aspiration Development Within Sociopolitical Contexts <p> The optimal development of an individual 's talents largely emerges from a motivating sense of the possible that persists over the long term . Aspirations provide the long-term motivational fuel for talent development , which in turn provides the basis for self-fulfillment over the course of a lifetime ( Gewirth , 1998 ) . Interdisciplinary syntheses of research and theory pertaining to aspiration development and self-fulfillment reveal barriers that can thwart the talent development of individuals ( Ambrose , 2003 ) . The most serious of these barriers derive from severe socioeconomic deprivation , which in turn derives from pressures toward increasing socioeconomic inequality in today 's globalized world . The forces of economic and sociopolitical globalization are increasing the already large rift between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , segregation , and stigmatization ( Hodgson , 2004 ; McLaren &; Farahmandpur , 2001 ) face much more daunting and growing barriers than do those who are born into affluence and the supportive networks of privilege . Consequently , underprivileged gifted and talented children are much more likely than their affluent peers to suffer from stunted aspirations that suppress their talent development and self-fulfillment . <p> While economic inequality presents serious barriers to aspiration development , the suppression of aspirations , talents , and self-fulfillment goes beyond economics into the realm of politics and ethics . The intricate intertwining of economic and political forces in today 's world brings to the forefront the ways in which liberal democracies operate , and the influences of economic and ideological actors on the maintenance or erosion of those democracies . Based on widespread scholarly recognition that vibrant liberal democracies provide the healthiest contexts for the agency of individuals ( Gutmann , 2003 ; Krugman , 2003 ; Posner , 2003 ; Shapiro , 2003 ; Wolin , 2004 ) , the forthcoming subsections address the political , economic , communicative , and ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The political and economic influences on the vibrancy of democracies are explored , including the influence of the media as an agent for transparency or deception in society . Some concepts developed by the eminent philosopher Hannah Arendt illuminate the ethical aspects of these contextual elements that influence democracies . All of these considerations are synthesized in the form of a conceptual model that portrays the dynamics of democratic growth and erosion , as well as the effects of these dynamics on aspiration and talent development toward self-fulfillment . Finally , implications for the education of the gifted and talented are drawn from the model . The Nature of Democracy <p> A common misconception is that nations are either democratic or they are not . Those who hold such beliefs fall prey to the fallacy of false dichotomy because they simplistically assume that the political world falls into two opposing , black and white , good versus evil categories  --  democratic or totalitarian . In actuality , there are shades of grey between the two political extremes , and the democratic status of a nation , once achieved , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation can strengthen its democratic fiber or allow its democracy to erode . Characteristics of Democracies <p> Political theorists have established some basic principles that characterize healthy liberal democracies . In a synopsis of these principles , Gutmann ( 2003 ) delineated the concepts of equal freedom , equal opportunity , and civic equality as three essentials for democratic legitimacy . The principle of equal freedom enjoins the government to respect the freedom of individuals to live their lives as they see fit as long as they respect the equal freedom of others . Basic democratic liberties include freedom from forms of subordination such as serfdom and forced labor along with freedom of expression , assembly , and association . Equal opportunity implies the provision of avenues through which individuals can live decent lives . Examples of basic opportunities include nondiscrimination in the distribution of educational and career opportunities . Civic equality implies the equal standing of all citizens as informed participants in the democratic process . It requires political rights that ensure a fair competitive democratic decision-making process as well as civil rights that provide due process and equal protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracies provide ample opportunity for citizens to participate in deliberation with others over the nature of governance and the provision of justice in the social order . <p> A society is undemocratic to the extent that it does not establish or preserve these principles . A nation aspiring to democracy fails if it ( a ) imposes laws that excessively constrain freedom of choice , ( b ) imposes political , legal , or economic barriers to opportunity that prevent people from leading decent lives , and ( c ) strongly favors the decision-making and participation of some citizens while strongly suppressing or outright denying the participation of others . The presence of these barriers to democracy in a society usually reveals the presence of pernicious domination , which occurs when groups of higher status illegitimately magnify their own already considerable power at the expense of others . Domination can occur when powerful groups control political agendas and constrain the choices of the less powerful by manipulating their thoughts and by controlling resources . According to Shapiro ( 2003 ) , the primary purpose of a democracy is to protect its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the economic vulnerability of some groups excessively subordinates them to the decision-making power of others . Consequently , highly stratified nations with large deprived subgroups are particularly prone to democratic erosion . In summary , a healthy liberal democracy rests upon the following key pillars : <p> Legitimacy . The vast majority of the population perceives the government as legitimately elected to power . <p> Transparency . Government decisions are made in the open . Secret back-room deals with lobbyists are rare minor annoyances instead of disturbing commonplace methods of operation . The media plays a crucial role in the maintenance of transparency by actively scrutinizing and critiquing the actions of politicians and other key constituencies in the society . <p> Widespread deliberative participation . Enfranchisement is widespread in the nation and the vast majority of enfranchised people actively participate in informed democratic decision making . They understand the issues and have sufficient understanding of the political process to actively engage in democratic participation and decision making in the society . <p> Prudent regulation . The nation maintains a healthy but restrained government bureaucracy ( Suleiman , 2003 ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to establish a level playing field for socioeconomic activity . <p> Distributive justice . The government intervenes in the socioeconomic system where gross inequities of power and wealth threaten the rights and agency of underprivileged populations . The goal is greater equality but not perfect equality ( Walzer , 2002 ) . The latter goal requires too much social engineering that excessively intrudes on individual rights , which are a valuable byproduct of democracies . However , excessive economic freedom in a society leaves regulatory gaps through which exploitative individuals and corporations can run roughshod over the rights of others ( Galbraith , 1996 ; Keynes , 1936 ) . Under such conditions , the needs of many are sacrificed to the whims of the few . The Fluid Dynamics and Imperfections of Democracy in the Modern World <p> On the surface , there appears to be reason for optimism about democratic governments as supportive contexts for the aspiration development of bright children in today 's world . For example , in the past few decades , there has been a dramatic proliferation of democracies in Africa , Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive steps in the transition from authoritarian power structures to democracies , and 33 of these formerly were military dictatorships ( United Nations , 2002 ) . <p> In spite of these bright signs , however , democracy once established is not cast in stone . It requires diligent maintenance by political leaders and citizens alike . Gutmann ( 2003 ) argued that all democracies in today 's world are imperfect and unjust to varying extents because they all fail to provide civic equality and equal freedom and opportunity to their citizens . <p> Given that democracy suffers where elites amass too much power , democratic erosion is particularly evident in regions where the elites who formerly ruled them still wield much power , and where democracies are embryonic and tenuous . For example , while much of the world was remarkably free of military coups during the period from 1985 to 2001 , sub-Saharan Africa suffered from 21 successful coups and 41 failed attempts ( McGowan , 2003 ) . Eighteen African nations experienced more than one coup while the people of Nigeria , Benin , and Burkina Faso each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although embryonic democracies are most prone to cataclysmic collapse , even well-established democracies can suffer from erosion . For example , the democratic German Weimar Republic of the interwar years eroded and then collapsed catastrophically during Hitler 's ascendance to power . Germany 's interwar economic difficulties and angst about defeat in World War I contributed to the rapid erosion of this healthy democracy , but it was the inept , irresponsible leadership of the sociopolitical elite that enabled ideological polarization to support the rise of Hitler 's autocratic Third Reich , one of the most oppressive totalitarian regimes in history ( Bermeo , 2003 ) . Other examples of democratic erosion come from the emergence and recession of democracies in Latin America and the former Soviet Union in recent decades ( Bermeo ; Meier , 2003 ; Satter , 2003 ) . <p> Even more disturbing , influential political theorist Sheldon Wolin argued that modern America , which commonly is extolled as a bastion of democratic excellence , is steadily transforming into an antidemocratic society due largely to the dominance of corporate elites in the modern world ( see Botwinick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have agreed , lamenting the corrosive effects of elitist power hoarding and runaway , globalized capitalism on previously healthy Western liberal democracies ( e.g. , Chambers , 2002 ; Galbraith , 1996 ; Gans , 2003 ; Hodgson , 2004 ; Krugman , 2003 ; Mayer , 1998 ; McMurtry , 1999 ; Orlie , 2001 ; Webb &; Webb , 1995 ) . A Model of Democratic Growth and Erosion <p> In historical analyses of the totalitarian political systems of the first half of the 20th century , Kedward ( 1971 ) recognized that radical left- and right-wing systems were very similar in nature , although they were typically placed at opposite ends of a political continuum and the proponents of each extreme viewed those at the other end as archenemies . He asserted that a continuum was the wrong way to portray the political extremes of radical left-wing communism and extremist right-wing fascism . Their intolerant , oppressive , tightly organized , often violent natures represented similarities that outweighed their inherent ideological incompatibilities . Instead , the continuum should be bent into a circle in which the polar opposites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The circle better represented the similarities of extremist regimes while simultaneously portraying moderate , centrist regimes as their opposite at the other side of the circle . <p> Important sociopolitical and economic elements can be pulled into a common framework that clarifies the impact of large-scale contexts on the development of gifted and talented young people . A conceptual model inspired by Kedward 's circle captures the political , economic , communicative , and ethical large-scale contexts under discussion here , as well as their effects on children 's aspiration and talent development toward self-fulfillment ( see Figure 2 ) . The model includes a modified version of Kedward 's totalitarian-democratic circle , which has been turned 90 degrees to produce a vertical dimension showing optimal liberal democracy in a lofty , ideal position above the dehumanizing region of totalitarianism below . Arrows pointing downward along the left- and right-wing sides of the circle represent the tendency for democratic erosion to occur when extremist elements prevail . A vertical arrow in the center of the circle represents opportunities for the growth of democracy when promising contextual conditions exist . Such conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic balance between left- and right-wing ideals with neither system of thought dominating to the extreme , as represented in the dual-ended ideological tension arrow above the circle . <p> The table at the right side shows the sociopolitical and economic conditions that prevail at the various levels of the model , as well as their influences on human development . The left column of the table shows political , economic , and media conditions that emerge at the liberal-democratic top of the model , the totalitarian nether regions , and the gray areas between where democratic erosion occurs . Various positions on the continuum of consent from Presbey 's ( 1997 ) interpretation of Hannah Arendt 's ideas about the relationship between power and group dynamics appear in italics at the various levels on this left column . The Presbey-Arendt continuum , which is described later in this section , maps onto the model because it reveals the degrees of free consent , deception , and coercion enjoyed or suffered by citizens in the varying sociopolitical and economic contexts from optimal liberal democracy to totalitarianism . Finally , the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large-scale contextual dimensions have on the aspiration development , talent development , and ultimately the self-fulfillment of gifted and talented young people . <p> The top of the circle continuum represents optimal liberal democracy , which entails transparent ( open , visible to the public ) decision making by a government seen as legitimate in the eyes of the people . Participation in the democratic process is broadly distributed , and individual rights are effectively blended with responsibility . The media is protected from monopolization by any particular group so it is able to produce objective , investigative journalism , which serves as a watchdog preserving democracy from corruption and domination . Consequently , the people enjoy widespread democratic participation because they have access to in-depth knowledge about the sociopolitical system , warts and all . In essence , optimal liberal democracy promises to cleanse the sociopolitical system of mass deception , corruption , exploitation , and domination . <p> However , strong liberal democracies are difficult to create and sustain , and they are prone to erosion , especially when political and economic issues take the form of conflicts between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Gutmann &; Thompson , 1996 ) . Through studies of the behaviors of ordinary people in the failing democracies of interwar Europe and in South American nations of the 1960s and 1970s , Bermeo found that one serious threat to democracy arises when citizens vacate the middle ground and form a polarization of extremists on both ends of an ideological continuum . <p> When either the extremist left- or right-wing side of the polarization comes to dominate in a nation , the sociopolitical system in that nation will slide down a slippery slope toward totalitarianism . For example , the extreme collective egalitarianism of some 20th-century communist governments tended to degrade into left-wing totalitarian dictatorships . This occurred with the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union and the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia , to give two specific examples . Similarly , extreme elitist pressures tended to produce right-wing totalitarian dictatorships such as Pinochet 's Chile and Fascist Germany . When polarization of extremists occurs in a nation , the dynamic balance of left- and right-wing ideology that produces the best opportunities for broadly distributed liberal-democratic freedom and opportunity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to dominate , thereby pushing the system far to the left or right side of the circle where democratic erosion occurs . <p> At the mid-levels of the model , democratic institutions still operate , but inefficiently with loopholes that allow the powerful to bypass many regulations and responsibilities . As Galbraith ( 1996 ) captured in the phrase , " democracy of the fortunate " ( p. 8 ) , the democratic processes that remain are operated by and for the elites much of the time . Consequently , these elites become increasingly able to control the economy , the media , and the political infrastructure itself , thus adding impetus to democratic erosion . <p> At the bottom of the circle , dictatorships or firmly entrenched plutocracies ( rule by the wealthy ) or oligarchies ( rule by an elite faction ) prevail , dominating by some blend of violence and mass deception . Omnipotent bureaucracies in leftist regimes or nepotistic fiefdoms in rightist regimes impose ironclad control over socioeconomic processes and aggressively suppress human rights . The ruling authorities exercise nearly complete control over the media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground media is the only forum for informed communicative action , so there is little opportunity for establishing widespread knowledgeable participation among the populace . <p> Nations can find themselves at any position on the model , from the heights of optimal liberal democracy to the depths of despair in the grip of totalitarian regimes such as Hitler 's Germany , Stalin 's Soviet Union , Pinochet 's Chile , or Pol Pot 's Cambodia , among many other examples . They can stabilize at any point on the model , or they can shift rapidly from one position to another . Modern Russia provides an example of a recent rapid transition . When the Soviet Union disintegrated in the late 20th century , Russians had an opportunity to build a liberal democracy . However , that opportunity proved to be ephemeral . Instead of progressing upward on the model toward democratic principles , Russia rapidly spun around the circle from the undemocratic lower left-wing sector of the model , where the old Soviet Union resided , to its current position in the undemocratic lower right-wing sector . Instead of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberative decision-making , Russia fell prey to power vacuums that allowed ruthless , individualistic gangster capitalists to seize control . Currently , the vast majority of Russians lack opportunity and civic equality while the select few members of a new and powerfully entrenched plutocracy run the nation for their own personal gain ( Meier , 2003 ; Satter , 2003 ) . The lives of the populace are just as miserable or even worse than before . The only change has been the polar opposite ideological nature of the sociopolitical system that oppresses them . <p> Such oppression is based on the dynamics of power , coercion , and manipulation that prevail in a particular society . Based on the ideas of the eminent philosopher Hannah Arendt , Presbey ( 1997 ) discerned that power relationships in families , communities , and nations range on a five-level continuum . Level one is most conducive to group or individual freedom and self-actualization while level five is least . The levels map onto the democratic model , describing the conditions faced by people who live in nations at various locations on the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy . Level five corresponds with the depths of totalitarianism . The other three levels describe conditions in the shades of gray between these political extremes . The following are some specifics of these levels : Free consent . Informed reason and argument prevail in decision-making processes through which all have access to accurate information and all sides are heard . Strategy and manipulation . Those vying for power tend to play on the emotions of others to win consent . There is much less emphasis on open communication and consideration of multiple perspectives . Propaganda . Those seeking or hoarding power use misinformation to mislead and to win consent . Coercion and threats of violence . Leaders use threats of economic sanctions , imprisonment , torture , and death to establish compliance . Physical constraint and violence . Leaders actually apply force to establish obedience . Such force often entails serious physical injury and even murder . <p> Obviously , a society that provides a context for talent development at levels two through five suppresses the aspiration development , self-fulfillment , and capacity development of its citizens , including many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower levels of the model , only the offspring of those who control the sociopolitical and economic systems enjoy the opportunity for optimal development . All others suffer manipulation , coercion , or violence which rob them of opportunities for active democratic agency and vigorous talent development . Evidence of Democratic Erosion and Aspiration Suppression in Today 's World : Some Current Sociopolitical and Economic Trends <p> The model of democratic growth and erosion encourages thinking about the fluid dynamics of sociopolitical and economic systems in today 's world and the implications those dynamics have for aspiration development and manifestations of talent . Trends in national and global economic and political systems suggest some reasons for concern about democratic erosion , even in well-established Western liberal democracies . Globalized " Economic Freedom " Paradoxically Generating Barriers to Aspiration and Talent Development <p> Neoclassical economists such Friedrich Hayek ( 1944 ) and Milton Friedman ( 1962,1975 ) provided the framework for the socioeconomic system that has dominated much of the world for the past few decades ( Breit &; Ransom , 1998 ) . Neoclassical economists advocate the freedom of the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend limiting the role of government to the provision of law and order including the enforcement of legal rules for economic transactions and the protection of individual property fights . The justification for this system is that the power of rational self-interest will increase savings , investments , and productivity , thereby maximizing per capita income and well-being for everyone . <p> The neoclassical system provides legitimate contributions to our socioeconomic systems , in particular its emphases on freedom and innovation , which are core values in the field of gifted education . However , any ideology taken too far can lead to oppression . Current neoconservative ideology pushes neoclassical economics far beyond the position of its pioneering theoretical icon , the 18th-century philosopher-economist , Adam Smith , who actually modified his enthusiasm for the " invisible hand " of the free marketplace with admonitions against gross inequity and exploitation of the poor ( Fleischacker , 2004 ; Muller , 1995 ) . Other scholars have agreed that neoclassical economics as it manifests in the modern world is extremist ( Galbraith , 1996 ; Hodgson , 2004 ; Keynes , 1936 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is creating an environment in which corporations wishing to exploit labor or the environment by escaping government regulations benefit from the divide-and-conquer mentality fomented by decentralization . Communities , states , nations , and regions that value environmental protection or adequate benefits and a living wage for workers suffer from the impotence of governmental regulation because corporations that want to escape responsibility simply pick up and move their capital to locations representing the lowest regulatory common denominator ( Shapiro , 2003 ) . Moreover , self-interested economic actors , such as robber barons and corporate executives , use their considerable and expanding resources to lobby for more aggressive deregulation when they do confront the remnants of diminishing government regulatory barriers ( McMurtry ) . <p> These phenomena , along with other related dynamics of the globalized economy , are magnifying the already severe discrepancies between haves and have-nots both within and among nations . They also are undermining the vibrancy and viability of current and emerging liberal democracies around the world because they further concentrate power in the hands of elites while leeching power from the vast majority of the citizenry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concentration of power in the hands of those who promote extreme versions of neoclassical economics , which is a cornerstone of fight-wing ideology , strongly pushes liberal democracies into the far right side of the circle in Figure 2 where democratic erosion occurs . Mass deception provides much of the impetus for the aggravation of socioeconomic stratification and the erosion of liberal democracies . Mass Deception : A Corrosive Force in Democratic Erosion <p> In an in-depth analysis of self-deception , Mele ( 2001 ) described how people deceive themselves when they hold excessive belief in things they want to be true , such as being admired more than is likely the case . Self-deception also occurs when people are in denial , believing against something they want not to be true , such as believing that their children are not drug addicted despite voluminous evidence to the contrary . Some specific forms of self-deception include ignoring or downplaying obvious data ( negative misinterpretation ) , warping negative evidence to make it appear to be in one 's favor ( positive misinterpretation ) , and excessively focusing on evidence that confirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence gathering ) . <p> While studies of self-deception tend to focus on the individual , the phenomenon also seems to occur in large scale . Entire nations can reinvent their histories , at least to some extent , thereby revising their collective identities . For example , post-World War II West Germans tended to engage in " selective remembering , " emphasizing crimes committed against Germans while minimizing their own past atrocities against others . This partial self deception on a massive scale contributed to the creation of a new national identity ( Moeller , 2001 ) . <p> Mass self-deception also seems to be prevalent in the political arena today . For example , Bachrach and Botwinick ( 1992 ) noted that American workers tend to be multi-conscious because they are deceived into holding inconsistent , contradictory political beliefs . They consider themselves to be conservative or moderate while holding the radical belief that the nation needs a new political party focused on the needs of working people . While conservative in general , abstract terms , they become radical progressives when they consider specific problems and policies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they feel powerless because they have no philosophical framework to help them unify or make sense of their beliefs . <p> It seems likely that self-deception , both individual and collective , contributes to the phenomenon of democratic erosion by aggravating the ideological polarization of populations , which most often takes the form of vehemently conflicting left- and fight-wing camps . Developments in national and global communications media suggest that mass deception heavily influences the dynamics of ideological polarization and strongly contributes to the erection of more daunting aspiration and capacity development barriers that hurt deprived populations . <p> For example , Postman 's ( 1985 ) analysis of the shaping influence of the modern media suggests how the critical thought processes of the public are suppressed . His claim that entertaining , emotion-laden imagery has supplanted complex thinking and substantive argument in the public discourse implies that the ideal communicative venue has arisen for transmission of deceptive , ideologically saturated messages from influential left- or fight-wing extremists . <p> Further setting the stage for mass deception , recent deregulation of media ownership and processes by the Federal Communications Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cable television industry , have been shifting news reporting away from objective investigation of important political trends and events toward shallow sensationalism and biased polemics from narrow-minded , ideologically extremist , celebrity pundits ( Hamilton , 2003 ) . The trend is to convey the news in the form of emotion-generating entertainment lacking in depth , detail , and balance . This trend fits Belsey 's ( 1998 ) description of two competing dimensions in the media : industrial versus ethical journalism . The profit-centered , entertainment-focused industrial dimension distorts and sensationalizes reporting while the ethical dimension promotes objective , investigative journalism . Today , with deregulation allowing for near monopoly control of the media by a few influential people and corporations , there is a danger that the concomitant media deception is putting control of public policy in the hands of an ever-smaller elite ( Franklin &; Pilling , 1998 ; Gans , 2003 ; Hamilton ) . Such a situation establishes ideal conditions for democratic erosion because the few powerful media owners today tend to be strong adherents to the tenets of right-wing , neoclassical ideology ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neoclassical economics and ideology on the global stage , along with the elevation of the industrial dimension of the media over its ethical dimension , is problematic for the health of liberal democracy . Such conditions suggest strong pressure on nations to move into the right-hand extremist dimension of the model where serious democratic erosion occurs . This raises concerns and questions about the education of bright young people . Implications for Educators of the Gifted and Talented <p> Sociopolitical events tend to swirl about beyond the scope of school classrooms , so it seems legitimate to ignore them because they are beyond our control . Nevertheless , the vibrancy of the aspirations and talent development of the children we serve largely depends on the sociopolitical context that envelopes and shapes them . Democratic erosion may be influencing the accuracy of young people 's knowledge about the world , along with their ability to navigate within it as concerned , active citizens . It also may be hurting the ability of bright , privileged children to empathize with their less fortunate peers . <p> The primary message from this analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiration development , talent development , and self-fulfillment of the most young people . Those raised in healthy liberal democracies have much more opportunity for optimal development than those raised in systems that deceive and exploit them and their parents . Moreover , healthy liberal democracies invite citizens ' full participation as democratic decision makers rather than suppressing their agency . Given the importance of the sociopolitical context to aspiration and talent development of gifted and talented children , everything else we do , from theorizing to research to curriculum development , means little if we ignore the phenomena of democratic erosion , mass deception , and exploitation , as well as their influences on aspirations . <p> If liberal democracies are eroding , as a number of influential political theorists contend , the sociopolitical leaders in those nations likely are employing deceit and coercion to strip away the agency of those who are not members of the elite . To the extent that this is occurring , it is creating large discrepancies in epistemic power , which is defined as one 's ability to know in the world ( Litke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the ropes " of sociopolitical and economic arenas with significant advantages over those who do not . Privileged insiders enjoy learning and experiential opportunities through which they have their views tested , modified , refined , and verified . Denial of these opportunities to learn the inside rules and traditions of sociopolitical institutions makes an individual or group epistemically helpless and prevents the development of the intellectual autonomy that insulates them from manipulation and exploitation . <p> Parents and groups suffering from socioeconomic deprivation lack the epistemic power necessary to advocate for their children 's development . When societies move far into the neoclassical right side of the model , they perpetuate and aggravate the epistemic helplessness of the deprived . Lack of access to equal educational opportunities ( Kozol , 1991 , 1995 ) and exclusive , insider socioeconomic networks ( Fischer et al. , 1996 ) deny talented but deprived young people the means necessary for discovering and energizing lofty aspirations . Consequently , they suffer from aspiration suppression and stunted talent development , and the lack of " giftedness " in underprivileged populations becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further undermines the vibrancy of liberal democracy , which requires the presence of widespread , public participation and deliberation . This creates a vicious circle that suppresses engagement in effective political activism on behalf of bright children in deprived districts . Using Gutmann 's ( 2003 ) terms , in a healthy democracy the voices of the deprived would advocate for nondiscrimination in the distribution of educational and career opportunities , and those voices would be heard because they would have ample opportunity to deliberate with others over the provision of justice in the society . To the extent that the deprived lack the epistemic power necessary to understand and articulate the nature of their disadvantage while facing media bias and distortion when they do try to express their concerns in the public forum , our democracy shows disturbing signs of erosion . In such conditions , only the aspirations and talents of the children of privileged insiders receive full attention . <p> While aspiration suppression is a problem for the deprived in poorly functioning democracies , the suppression of empathy is a problem for all because it directly contributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended that empathy gulfs exist in highly stratified nations because gross inequalities of wealth and power in a society create " structural incentives for the rich and middle classes to marginalize the poor " ( p. 9 ) . Where the powerful are separated from the deprived by the de facto segregation of suburban enclaves and exclusive social networks , the resulting empathy gulfs can contribute to the erosion of democracy . If we want to preserve and enhance democracies as vibrant contexts for the aspiration development of all gifted and talented children , rich and poor alike , we will have to address empathy gulfs at their essence . Consequently , educational programs for gifted and talented children of privilege should not focus too heavily on the needs and talents of individuals . Where this occurs , it can reinforce the empathy gulfs by venerating the atomistic , self-centered hyperindividualism promoted by neoclassical ideology while ignoring the plight of those less fortunate . <p> Instead , programs for all gifted and talented children should include healthy doses of awareness about the sociopolitical and economic contexts in which gifted and talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power while their privileged peers may develop the empathy necessary for the emergence of altruism over the long run . Bright young people should be made aware of democratic erosion and the injustice it foments . Given that optimal self-fulfillment emerges from a strong relational-altruistic orientation to the world , as opposed to a strong , self-centered individualistic one ( Gewirth , 1998 ) , the children of privilege also can benefit from awareness of democratic erosion and the unfortunate situations of their underprivileged peers because such awareness can provide fuel for the development of empathy . They need to avoid entrapment within narrow self-interest because , when taken to the extreme , it makes them see themselves and others as excessively atomistic , self-obsessed players in a winner-take-all society , which is a vision incongruent with some important principles of democracy . <p> The need for more contextual awareness magnifies the importance of critical thought capacities in programs for the gifted and talented . Strong elements of critical thought must permeate our programs because the problem of democratic erosion suggests a pressing need for the gifted and talented to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political theorists Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson ( 1996 ) , for example , argued that improving our collective capacity for complex moral dialogue is a much better way to preserve democracy in times of polarization than over-relying on the rules and procedures of political and judicial institutions . Bermeo 's ( 2003 ) portrayal of the culpability of inept , irresponsible elites in cases of democratic erosion reinforces this contention . <p> Extremists of either variety , left- or right-wing , tend to be incapable of complex moral dialogue because , by nature , they must subscribe to a simplistic , one-sided view of the world . The theories from which they draw may be important and resilient , soaring pieces of intellectual architecture . For example , Marxist theory arose as an insightful , necessary response to the excesses of early industrialization and the accompanying misery of mass exploitation , and it still is relevant today given the exploitative nature of economic globalization ( Wolin , 2004 ) . In opposition to Marxism , neoclassical economic theory ( Friedman , 1975 ; Hayek , 1944 ) also can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem arises when ideologues employ these theories in the real world , watering them down in their less complex minds and viewing all socioeconomic issues through simplistic , extremist conceptual lenses . <p> Higher-order thinking requires appreciation of complexity , uncertainty , and multiple perspectives , along with the ability to engage in nuanced judgment and interpretation ( Resnick , 1987 ) . In contrast , ideological extremism requires tenacious , dogmatic adherence to a single perspective , which in turn requires black and white , absolutist thought and a proclivity for superficial surface skimming over complex , multidimensional issues . Gifted and talented children from privileged backgrounds are likely to be enlisted for sociopolitical leadership positions in adulthood . If they grow up as extremists , they will be inclined to waste their considerable intellectual power on designing narrow , insular justifications for their dogmatism rather than engaging with others in creative dialogue aimed at sociopolitical problem solving through nuanced syntheses of diverse perspectives . If nations prone to democratic erosion continue to elect leaders based on their simplistic , steadfast decisiveness while rejecting candidates who seem indecisive because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the risk of choosing leaders with interpersonal gifts but serious cognitive deficits , which make them incapable of protecting democracy in an increasingly complex world . <p> In view of the need for complex moral dialogue to preserve and strengthen democracy , Dewey 's ( 1938 ) long-standing and oft-debated recommendations for progressive education again come to the fore . From the viewpoint of the democratic model , school reform initiatives based on the promotion of essentialist philosophy and the denigration of progressivism look like a particularly insidious manifestation of mass deception based on ideological polarization . <p> More specific educational strategies capable of enhancing complex moral dialogue include Socratic questioning and the jurisprudential instructional model . Paul ( 1991 ) demonstrated how Socratic questioning encourages students to trace their unquestioned beliefs to their sources , thereby revealing how they initially acquired their viewpoints and why they dogmatically persist in holding them . Such questioning also reveals conflicting beliefs that students hold simultaneously as well as the implications of their belief systems . For example , if well done , the process of persistent , probing , critical questioning could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare reform , as it applies to single mothers , in conjunction with their beliefs that some large pharmaceutical companies are exemplars of free-market innovation when , in fact , these companies are the beneficiaries of huge corporate welfare allocations in the form of patent laws ( see Angell , 2004 , for taxpayer-funded research and monopolistic elaboration on this particular version of corporate welfare ) . <p> The jurisprudential instructional model ( Joyce &; Weil , 1996 ) is particularly suited to critical thought applied to the model of democratic growth and erosion . The model requires students to identify opposing positions on a complex issue , to delineate the main points of each position , and then to construct a new synthesis : a compromise position that may favor one of the initial viewpoints but does not grossly violate the other . It is this injunction against gross violation that could make students somewhat less inclined to adopt extremist positions when they become active citizens in the sociopolitical arena . <p> In a hypothetical example of talent development without sufficient context-based critical thought , a mathematically gifted child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become captivated by neoclassical economic theory and decide to follow it through college . He or she may seek deeper immersion by enrolling in a graduate school that is saturated with neoclassical ideology , such as the University of Chicago Law School , and then actively promote the ideology by securing employment as an economic analyst for a neoclassical policy think tank such as the Cato Institute , Heritage Foundation , or Fraser Institute . Such a career trajectory will drive the individual ever deeper into extremist right-wing , neoclassical ideology . <p> While the perspectives of neoclassical think tanks play a role in liberal-democratic processes as part of a rich mixture of ideas , they contribute to the erosion of democracy if they come to dominate the public consciousness . Their domination could force the polity too far to the right side of the democratic model where inadequate ideological balance exists and where democratic slippage occurs . While we have no right to deny a talented young person that particular developmental path , if it occurs frequently with talented youth , our work could represent active support for ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . <p> In terms of research initiatives in the field , democratic erosion suggests the need for more attention to the contextual influences on manifestations of giftedness and talent , particularly as these pertain to the development of bright , deprived children . Prior investigations of influences from deprived urban and rural environments ( e.g. , Borland , Schnur , &; Wright , 2000 ; Borland &; Wright , 1994 , 2000 ; Frasier , 1989 ; VanTassel-Baska , 1992 ; VanTassel-Baska , Patton , &; Prillaman , 1991 ) , and the experiences of minorities in school and society ( e.g. , Ford , 1993 , 1996 ; Ford &; Harris , 1999 ; Frasier , 1989 , 1993 ; Frasier , Garcia , &; Martin , 1992 ; Maker , 1996 ; Peterson , 1999 ; Scott , Deuel , Jean-Francois , &; Urbano , 1996 ; Tomlinson , Callahan , &; Lelli , 1997 ) represent good beginnings . Studies of cultural differences in belief systems ( e.g. , Peterson ) can show more about the conflicts that permeate multidimensional democracies and the challenges faced by bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses of scholarship from large-scale contextual fields , such as political theory , sociology , philosophy , and economics , can keep us aware of outside influences on gifted and talented young people and the educators who serve them . <p> Another aspect of the research dimension of the field also deserves magnification . We can preserve and extend our own epistemic power and that of the children we serve by making room for investigative methods that reveal the nature and extent of our mass self-deception . For example , the research tradition of critical theory directly addresses power imbalances that hurt the deprived ( Bowers , 2000 ; Giroux , 1999 ) . Bowers , for instance , analyzes the ways in which unquestioned tacit assumptions amplify the value of computer technology while obscuring the environmental degradation , cultural homogenization , and economic inequities that the unchecked proliferation of technology foments . He points out that our educational system does little to challenge assumptions that exalt the marketplace and technology while ignoring the importance of communities and ecology . <p> In addition , the research methods of semiotic analysis enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodge &; Kress , 1988 ) . Semioticians argue that meaning is not produced solely by collections of sounds or symbols that directly correspond with concepts . Rather than taking for granted the surface meaning of text and other communication , they look for underlying contextual influences and ideological permeation . This perspective on research tends to reveal subtle , tacit influences of ideology and culture on the media , politics , education , mythology , and other dimensions of our lives . In an example , the symbolism that surrounds the purchase of ever-larger luxury vehicles implies much more than simple consumerism . It reveals conspicuous consumption rooted in cultural assumptions that tightly connect egoistic status and power with insatiable materialism . In short , semiotic analysis enables us to discover tacit influences on our thought and make more conscious decisions about their worthiness . <p> The talented young people with whom we work deserve our best efforts to expand their minds beyond the immediate and particular . In today 's globalized , polarized world , we must give them the best opportunities for development of the strongest possible epistemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polarization and democratic erosion . In order to accomplish this lofty goal , we must expand our own perception into the complexities of the sociopolitical and economic phenomena that swirl about us and shape our profession . <p> Manuscript submitted June 16 , 2004 . <p> Revision accepted August 27 , 2004 . <p> GRAPH : Figure 1 Modified Version of Kedward 's Circle of Political Extremism Figure 2 A Model of Democratic Growth and Erosion PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>
