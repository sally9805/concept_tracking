Couplings and cable splitters ( for the derailleurs and rear brake ) allow you to disassemble and pack the frame in about 20 minutes-just about 5 minutes longer than packing a standard road bike ; reassembly takes about 10 .

S &S; Machine 's BTC couplings are exquisitely machined stainless steel couplings silver-brazed into the top and down tubes . The couplings , stronger and more rigid than the tubing they replace , actually strengthen the Co-Pilot . Once tightened with the supplied spanner , they 're completely trustworthy . Nesting the parts into the case is tricky the first time , but after that it 's no more difficult than assembling a cabin from Lincoln Logs .
