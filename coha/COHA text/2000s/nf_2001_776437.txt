Welcome to Faircrest High // Faircrest High School 's values : Be punctual , prepared , tolerant , honest , respectful , responsible . //  --  posted on a sign in a FHS classroom // " I wish I could have a class full of students like Eve , " says the chair of the history department , describing one of his " ideal " pupils . Eve has a 3.97 grade point average . She is ranked in the top 10 percent of her class and is enrolled in every honors and advanced placement level course available to her . Her r ? sum ? lists more than 25 school activities in which she has participated since her freshman year , ranging from field hockey and symphonic band to student council , Spanish club , and Junior Statesmen of America . // Another teacher recommends Kevin . He is well known at the school because of his friendly personality , his high grades , and his star performance on the school soccer team . For the past two years he has led a student-run community service project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in neighboring towns . He takes classes from both the college preparatory track as well as the honors track , and he is in the highest possible courses for his grade level in three subject areas : English , history , and French . " He is so smart and such a nice boy , " says the PE teacher , " if I had a son , I would want one like him . " // Other names come up multiple times . Michelle , an exceptional drama and music student , is recommended for her acting performances , her top grades , and her enrollment in a special program called The Community Project . Teresa is an outstanding student in the new business theme house , excelling in business computing skills . She impresses teachers by her desire to " challenge " herself and her commitment to the Mexican Student Association . Finally , there is Roberto , who hopes to be the first in his immediate family to attend college . He is recommended for his diligence and dedication to this goal , as well as his successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coordinator 's Commendation for Excellence . // " These students represent some of our best and brightest , " a guidance counselor notes with pride . " They are good kids who work hard and do well . Actually , I could name many others just like them , but you only need five . " Such was my introduction to Faircrest High . // I chose to study students at Faircrest because of its excellent reputation . The school , located in a wealthy California suburb , has one of the lowest dropout rates in the state , small class sizes , and a " long-standing tradition of hiring the best teachers to provide the highest quality instruction . " The school 's annual report lists college acceptance rates , scholastic aptitude test results , and the number of students commended for National Merit distinction , all of which rank Faircrest well above the state average . More than one-third of the student body is enrolled in honors and advanced placement ( AP ) courses , and many of these students " get accepted to universities such as Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student success is everywhere . Teachers announce awards over the loudspeaker each morning : " Congratulations to Mr. Parker 's class and the three winners of the state math competition ... names are read aloud . Overall , Faircrest came in second , just behind Alpine School this year . Let 's come in first next time ! " The school sends dozens of letters home congratulating students who maintain 4.0 averages each semester . Teachers post the best essays and test results on classroom walls , hanging banners with the names of students who earned perfect scores on advanced placement exams from the past ten years . And each month , every department honors an outstanding student , posting his or her photo on a central bulletin board and listing the names in the yearbook . In publications , on the walls , and over the loudspeakers , Faircrest 's top students are impressive . They are articulate , focused , multitalented , and industrious . They are the pride of the public education system and the hope for the future . // Listen to the students , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep up her grades , Eve sleeps just two to three hours each night and lives in a constant state of stress . Kevin faces anxiety and frustration as he attempts to balance the high expectations of his father with his own desire to " have a life " outside of school . Michelle struggles to find a way to pursue her love for drama without compromising her college prospects . And both Teresa and Roberto resort to drastic actions when they worry that they will not maintain the grades they need for future careers . All of them admit to doing things that they 're not proud of in order to succeed in school . // These students explain that they are busy at what they call " doing school . " They realize that they are caught in a system where achievement depends more on " doing "  --  going through the correct motions  --  than on learning and engaging with the curriculum . Instead of thinking deeply about the content of their courses and delving into projects and assignments , the students focus on managing the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high grades . They learn to raise their hands even when they do n't know the answers to the teachers ' questions in order to appear interested . They understand the importance of forming alliances and classroom treaties to win favors from teachers and administrators . Some feel compelled to cheat and to contest certain grades and decisions in order to get the scores they believe they need for the future . As Kevin asserts : // People do n't go to school to learn . They go to get good grades which brings them to college , which brings them the high-paying job , which brings them to happiness , so they think . But basically , grades is where it 's at . // Values normally espoused in schools , such as honesty , diligence , and teamwork , necessarily come into question when the students must choose between these ideals and getting top grades . It is hard to be a team player when you are competing with peers for an A grade on the class curve . It is difficult to remain honest when so much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is too much work to do and too little time in which to do it . The workload is so great and the expectations so high that these students feel obligated to give up recreation and sleep time as well as many aspects of a social life in order to succeed . Eve explains : " All year I sat and stared at the names on the banner in my history class , and it became my entire goal ; ... I swore I would get my name up there if it killed me . " Her devotion to success eventually earns her a spot on the history advanced placement banner . And though the pressure to succeed does not " kill " her , it does make her physically ill . She , like the others , has learned to do " whatever it takes " to get ahead , even if this means sacrificing " individuality , health , and happiness "  --  not to mention compromising ethical principles . // These students regret the frenetic pace of their school days and the undue stress they endure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs and values by kissing up , lying , and cheating . But they also do not like what they see as the alternative . They believe job prospects and income are better for college graduates , especially for those who earn credentials from prestigious universities . Lower grades and test scores might jeopardize future wealth and well-being . Hence , the students are victims of what I call the " grade trap . " They feel bound by a narrow definition of success and resigned to a system in which ultimate satisfaction may not be attainable. // To their teachers , administrators , parents , and community , these students represent the " ideal . " They are motivated to get ahead and work hard to achieve high grades . They participate in extracurricular activities , serve their communities , earn numerous awards and honors , and appear to uphold the values posted on the walls of the Faircrest classrooms . This book examines the behavior behind the success . The chapters , written as individual portraits , offer an inside view of the complexity of student life as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . // Although Faircrest High , along with most schools , claims to value certain character traits such as honesty and respect , the student experiences in the competitive academic environment reflect the conflicting goals inherent in the educational system today . As you read about the students  --  whose stories may resonate with " successful " high school students throughout this country  --  ask yourself the following questions : What kind of behavior is fostered by the expectations of the school community and by those outside of the school ? Can students meet these expectations without sacrificing personal and academic goals and beliefs ? Can parents encourage their children to strive for future success without pushing too hard or advocating questionable behavior ? What can school teachers and administrators do in light of the constraints of college admission requirements and national education policies that spur competition for high grades and test scores ? Are we fostering an environment that promotes intellectual curiosity , cooperation , and integrity , or are our schools breeding anxiety , deception , and frustration ? Are they impeding the very values they claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are they ready for the world of work ? Are they ready to be valuable members of our society ? And is this the kind of education to which we as a nation should aspire ? // Listen to the voices of these five students . //
