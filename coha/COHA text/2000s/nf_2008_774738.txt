HENRY DAVID THOREAU // Henry David Thoreau ( 1817-1862 ) was born , grew up , lived out his life , and died in Concord , Massachusetts . He studied at Harvard from 1833 to 1837 , then signed on as a teacher at Concord Academy but was dismissed for refusing to whip students . He and his brother John opened an elementary school in 1838 , where , according to some authorities , they invented the idea of the field trip . John became sick in 1841 and the brothers closed the school ; Henry went to live with Ralph Waldo Emerson , beginning a long friendship with him and with the other members of the Transcendental Club , among them Bronson Alcott and Margaret Fuller . The other transcendentalists experimented with communes like Brook Farm , but Thoreau was more solitary , and the most important years in his life began in 1845 when he took up residence in a small cabin he 'd built on the shore of Walden Pond a short walk from town . He spent two years , two months , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorean 's isolation at Walden was n't absolute or deliberately ascetic-he often returned to town to see friends and eat meals , had a steady stream of visitors ( often too steady for his taste ) , and at one point engaged in a political protest , spending a night in Concord jail for his refusal to pay his poll tax . But it was notably productive : he returned to town with the draft of one book ( A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers ) and the notes that he would spend the next six years turning into Walden ( 1854 ) , perhaps the most remarkable book in the American canon . As dense as scripture , crowded with aphorism , Walden is full of enough ideas for a score of ordinary books . But it has lived as long and as fully as any other writing of its vintage and inspired all the best kinds of people : both Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr . claimed him as a major influence . Thoreau suffered from tuberculosis contracted during his college years : his condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years revising his accounts of the Maine woods and other works . As he neared death his aunt Louisa asked him if he had made his peace with God . " I did not know we had ever quarreled , " he said . He died at the age of 44. // Picking a few fragments from his writings is an impossible task : an anthology of American environmental writing might well be one-third Thoreau . Here are a few entries from his copious journals , and then the description from Walden of the building of the famous cabin .

As I live now so shall I reap . If I grow pines and birches , my virgin mould will not sustain the oak , but pines and birches , or , perchance , weeds and brambles , will constitute my second growth . - - // March 6th 1838 // - - How can a man sit down and quietly pare his nails , while the earth goes gyrating ahead amid such a din of sphere music , whirling him along about her axis some twenty four thousand miles between sun and sun ? but mainly in a circle some two millions of miles actual progress . And then such a hurly-burly on the surface-wind always blowing-now a zephyr , now a hurricane-tides never idle , ever fluctuating , no rest for Niagara , but perpetual ran-tan on those limestone rocks-and then that summer simmering which our ears are used to-which would otherwise be christened confusion worse confounded , but is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incessant tinkering named hum of industry-the hurrying to and fro and confused jabbering of men-Can man do less than get up and shake himself ? // April 24th 1838. // Steam ships // - Men have been contriving new means and modes of motion-Steam ships have been westering during these late days and nights on the Atlantic waves-the fuglers of a new evolution to this generation - - Meanwhile plants spring silently by the brook sides-and the grim woods wave indifferent-the earth emits no howl pot on fire simmers and seethes and men go about their business . - - // Saturday March 19th 1842 // When I walk in the fields of Concord and meditate on the destiny of this prosperous slip of the Saxon family - the unexhausted energies of this new country-I forget that this which is now Concord was once Musketaquid and that the American race has had its destiny also . Everywhere in the fields-in the corn and grain land-the earth is strewn with the relics of a race which has vanished as completely as if trodden in with the earth . // I find it good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Where ever I go I tread in the tracks of the Indian-I pick up the bolt which he has but just dropped at my feet . And if I consider destiny I am on his trail . I scatter his hearth stones with my feet , and pick out of the embers of his fire the simple but enduring implements of the wigwam and the chace-In planting my corn in the same furrow which yielded its increase to his support so long-I displace some memorial of him . // I have been walking this afternoon over a pleasant field planted with winter rye-near the house . Where this strange people once had their dwelling place . Another species of mortal men but little less wild to me than the musquash they hunted-Strange spirits-daemons-whose eyes could never meet mine . With another nature-and another fate than mine- The crows flew over the edge of the woods , and wheeling over my head seemed to rebuke-as dark winged spirits more akin to the Indian than I. Perhaps only the present disguise of the Indian- If the new has a meaning so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as green-Indeed our eye splits on every object , and we can as well take one path as the other-If I consider its history it is old-if its destiny it is new-I may see a part of an object or the whole-I will not be imposed on and think nature is old , because the season is advanced I will study the botany of the mosses and fungi on the decayed-and remember that decayed wood is not old , but has just begun to be what it is . I need not think of the pine almond or the acorn and sapling when I meet the fallen pine or oak-more than of the generations of pines and oaks which have fed the young tree . // The new blade of the corn-the third leaf of the melon-these are not green but gray with time , but sere in respect of time . // September 12 , 1851 // 2 PM To the Three Friends ' Hill beyond Flints Pond-via RR .

I have thought it the best especially in the winter which I can get in this neighborhood . It is worth the while to see the Mts in the horizon once a day . I have thus seen some earth which corresponds to my least earthly &amp; trivial-to my most heaven-ward looking thoughts-The earth seen through an azure an etherial veil . They are the natural temples elevated brows of the earth-looking at which the thoughts of the beholder are naturally elevated and etherialized . I wish to see the earth through the medium of much air or heaven-for there is no paint like the air . Mts thus seen are worthy of worship . I go to Flints ' Pond also to see a rippling lake &amp; a reedy-island in its midst-Reed Island . // A man should feed his senses with the best that the land affords // At the entrance to the Deep Cut I heard the telegraph wire vibrating like an ? olian Harp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently , such was its effect on my thoughts-It reminded me , I say , with a certain pathetic moderation-of what finer &amp; deeper stirrings I was susceptible-which grandly set all argument &amp; dispute aside- -a triumphant though transient exhibition of the truth . It told me by the faintest imaginable strain-it told me by the finest strain that a human ear can hear-yet conclusively &amp; past all refutation-that there were higher infinitely higher plains of life-which it behoved me never to forget . As I was entering the Deep Cut the wind which was conveying a message to me from heaven dropt it on the wire of the telegraph which it vibrated as it past . I instantly sat down on a stone at the foot of the telegraph pole-&amp; attended to the communication . It merely said " Bear in mind , Child &amp; never for an instant forget-that there are higher plains infinitely higher plains of life than this thou art now travelling on . Know that the goal is distant &amp; is upward and is worthy all your life 's efforts to attain to . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard nothing more . // There is every variety &amp; degree of inspiration from mere fullness of life to the most rapt mood . A human soul is played on even as this wire-which now vibrates slowly &amp; gently so that the passer can hardly hear it &amp; anon the sound swells &amp; vibrates with such intensity as if it would rend the wire-as far as the elasticity &amp; tension of the wire permits-and now it dies away and is silent-&amp; though the breeze continues to sweep over it , no strain comes from it-&amp; the traveller hearkens in vain . It is no small gain to have this wire stretched through Concord though there may be no Office here . Thus I make my own use of the telegraph-without consulting the Directors-like the sparrows which I perceive use it extensively for a perch . // Shall I not go to this office to hear if there is any communication for me-as steadily as to the Post office in the village ? // Tuesday Dec 30th // Mem . Go to the Deep Cut . The flies now crawl forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer-without life or energy enough to clean their wings // This afternoon being on fair Haven Hill I heard the sound of a saw-and soon after from the cliff saw two men sawing down a noble pine beneath about 40 rods off . I resolved to watch it till it fell-the last of a dozen or more which were left when the forest was cut and for 15 years have waved in solitary majesty over the sproutland . I saw them like beavers or insects gnawing at the trunk of this noble tree , the diminutive mannikins with their crosscut saw which could scarcely span it . It towered up a hundred feet as I afterward found by measurement-one of the tallest probably now in the township &amp; straight as an arrow , but slanting a little toward the hill side. - its top seen against the frozen river &amp; the hills of Conantum . I watch closely to see when it begins to move . Now the sawers stop-and with an axe open it a little on the side toward which it leans that it may break the faster . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined one quarter of the quadrant , and breathless I expect its crashing fall-But no I was mistaken it has not moved an inch , it stands at the same angle as at first . It is 15 minutes yet to its fall . Still its branches wave in the wind as if it were destined to stand for a century , and the wind soughs through its needles as of yore ; it is still a forest tree-the most majestic tree that waves over Musketaquid. - The silvery sheen of the sunlight is reflected from its needles-it still affords an inaccessible crotch for the squirrel 's nest not a lichen has forsaken its mastlike stem- - its raking mast-the hill is the hull . Now 's the moment the mannikins at its base are fleeing from their crime-they have dropped the guilty saw &amp; axe . How slowly &amp; majestically it starts-as if it were only swayed by a summer breeze and would return without a sigh to its location in the air-&amp; now it fans the hill side with its fall and it lies down to its bed in the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a feather , folding its green mantle about it like a warrior-as if tired of standing it embraced the earth with silent joy. - returning its elements to the dust again-but hark ! there you only saw-but did not hear-There now comes up a deafening crash to these rocks-advertising you that even trees do not die without a groan . It rushes to embrace the earth , &amp; mingle its elements with the dust . And now all is still once more &amp; forever both to eye &amp; ear . // I went down and measured it . It was about 4 feet in diameter where it was sawed-about 100 feet long . Before I had reached it-the axe-men had already half divested it of its branches . Its gracefully spreading top was a perfect wreck on the hill side as if it had been made of glass-&amp; the tender cones of one years growth upon its summit appealed in vain &amp; too late to the mercy of the chopper . Already he has measured it with his axe-and marked out the mill logs it will make . And the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 centuries . It is lumber He has laid waste the air . When the fish hawk in the spring revisits the banks of the Musketaquid , he will circle in vain to find his accustomed perch. - &amp; the henhawk will mourn for the pines lofty enough to protect her brood . A plant which it has taken two centuries to perfect rising by slow stages into the heavens-has this afternoon ceased to exist . Its sapling top had expanded to this January thaw as the forerunner of summers to come . Why does not the village bell sound a knell . I hear no knell tolled-I see no procession of mourners in the streets-or the woodland aisles-The squirrel has leapt to another tree-the hawk has circled further off-&amp; has now settled upon a new eyre but the woodman is preparing to lay his axe at the root of that also . // Dec 31st // The 3d warm day . now overcast and beginning to drizzle . Still it is inspiriting as the brightest weather though the sun surely is not agoing to shine . There is a latent light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air . These are warm foggy days in winter which excite us. // It reminds me this thick spring like weather , that 1 have not enough valued and attended to the pure clarity &amp; brilliancy of the winter skies-Consider in what respects the winter sunsets differ from the summer ones . Shall I ever in summer evenings see so celestial a reach of blue sky contrasting with amber as I have seen a few days since-The day sky in winter corresponds for clarity to the night sky in which the stars shine &amp; twinkle so brightly in this latitude . // I am too late perhaps , to see the sand foliage in the deep cut-should have been there day before yesterday-it is now too wet &amp; soft . // ( Continues ... ) //
