Ida B . . . and Her Plans to Maximize Fun , Avoid Disaster , and ( Possibly ) Save the World Chapter One " Ida B , " Mama said to me on one of those days that start right and just keep heading toward perfect until you go to sleep , " when you 're done with the dishes , you can go play . Daddy and I are going to be working till dinner . " " Yes , ma'am , " I said back , but I said it like this , " Yes , may-uhm ! " because I could n't wait to get on with my business . I could already hear the brook calling to me through the back door screen . " C'm on out and play , Ida B. Hurry up , hurry up , hurry up . " I had three places I wanted to visit , six things I wanted to make , and two conversations I hoped to have before dinnertime . Mama was washing , Daddy was drying , and I was putting away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I set the last pan in its place , I was free . But the way those two were chatting and laughing and acting like we had till next week to finish up , I could see it was going to be a while . My insides started itching and my feet started hopping , one then the other , because they were ten minutes past being ready to go . So I decided to speed things up a bit . Daddy 'd hand me a dish , I 'd sprint to the cupboard and put it away , race back again , and put my hand out for the next one , with my right foot tap , tap , tapping the seconds that were ticking by . " Hold your horses , Ida B , " Daddy told me . " There 's plenty of time to do whatever you 're planning . " And he passed me a plate , slow and easy . Well , that stopped me in my tracks . Because what Daddy said might have seemed all right to him , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to be able to put away another tiny teaspoon till I set things straight . " Daddy , " I said , and I waited till he was looking at me before I went on . " Yes , Ida B , " he answered , turning toward me . And staring right into his eyeballs I told him , " There is never enough time for fun . " Daddy 's eyes opened wide , and for a half second I wondered if I was in for something close to trouble . But then the two ends of his mouth turned up , just a little . " Ida B , " he told the ceiling while he shook his head . " Hmmmmm , " Mama said , like a smile would sound if it could . And as soon as Daddy handed me the big frying pan , I set it in the drawer next to the oven , and I was on my way . " Come on , Rufus , " I called to Daddy 's old floppy-eared dog , who was napping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you 'll have some company . " Now , a school of goldfish could go swimming in the pool of drool that dog makes while he 's sleeping . But as soon as he heard his name and saw me heading for outside he jumped up , cleaned up the extra slobber around his mouth , and in two and one-half seconds ' time , he was waiting for me at the back door .
