Are you branching out into producing films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . We 're producing the romantic comedy Boyfriend in a Box , that I plan to star in , and a secret project I ca n't talk about yet .

" C That sounds dangerous ! B Yeah , I 'm a giver . I 've learned to be selective of the people in my world , because if I love someone , I will give them my blood , whatever they need . In doing so , one can end up with little left for themselves . Its a lesson in self-preservation that I 'm still learning . If you do n't have yourself , you have nothing to give . C What words best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still friends with all of my ex-boyfriends but one . The most important thing is to preserve the friendship and make it grow .
