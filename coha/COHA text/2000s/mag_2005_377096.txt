Among the most heartbreaking aspects of the tsunami disaster has been the immense toll on children , who account for as many as one-third of the total killed . Now , as refugees register in makeshift camps , the world is confronting a different sort of tragedy : tens of thousands of children have been either separated from their parents or orphaned . These kids , whom relief workers are calling " the Tsunami Generation , " have become prime objects of the global outpouring of sympathy . But they are also drawing some unwanted attention . <P> Relief workers say many orphans are suffering from both physical and psychological trauma . Martin Dawes , a UNICEF spokesman in Colombo , Sri Lanka , says many are " in a state of denial . " Some who saw their mothers drown , he says , cling to the belief that Mom has just gone to the ocean for a while , and that she will soon return . Protecting children from exploitation is another priority . Previous disasters have demonstrated that kids are targets for gangs involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The issue was thrown into stark relief following reports that a missing 12-year-old Swedish boy , Kristian Walker , may have been abducted in Thailand . The scare turned out to be a case of mistaken identity , but the possibility that kids could be picked off by traffickers remains a pressing concern . <P> How serious is the threat ? Supervisors in at least one refugee center in Sri Lanka report that people have turned up asking if they can buy children . But government officials say they have found no credible evidence of organized trafficking in the country . Indonesian volunteers helping displaced kids in Aceh  --  where 35,000 or more children have been orphaned or separated from their parents  --  tell TIME they are approached daily by people falsely claiming to be relatives of the orphans . UNICEF director Carol Bellamy warned of the danger after agency employees in Indonesia received text messages from a group purporting to offer Aceh 's tsunami orphans for adoption . " Bad people take advantage of difficult situations , " Bellamy says . Although the messages themselves could have been hoaxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banning adoptions out of Aceh . <P> Indeed , none of the affected nations are eager to send tsunami orphans abroad . Consulates , adoption agencies and relief organizations in Europe and across the U.S. have fielded hundreds of inquiries from people interested in adopting tsunami victims . The U.S. State Department , for its part , has placed a moratorium on adoptions of tsunami survivors by U.S. citizens . For one thing , not all the displaced children are necessarily orphans . Some newly single parents may have dropped off their kids at shelters as they surveyed the ruins of their houses and lives . Other parents may still be alive but were separated from their children during the chaos of the flood . " For every story about an orphan , " says Paul Deveril , a UNICEF project officer in India , " there 's also a story about a parent searching for their child . " Then , too , child-welfare experts strive to place orphans in new homes within their extended families and communities . " The children have been through a massive shock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French agency . " We should n't make life even harder by uprooting them . "
