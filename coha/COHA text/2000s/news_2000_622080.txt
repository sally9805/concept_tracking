<p> Silicon Valley deserves plenty of credit for fueling virtually unprecedented economic growth . <p> But the tech industry 's global headquarters also merits much of the blame for Bay Area electricity shortages this week when record high temperatures pushed the power grid to the breaking point . <p> Demand for electricity in Silicon Valley is increasing by about 5 percent a year  --  compared with a statewide average of 2 percent  --  while no new power plants are slated to come on line until next year at the earliest . <p> " Demand will keep rising , " said Larry Owens , head of customer services for Silicon Valley Power , the municipal utility of Santa Clara County . " Through next summer at least , we will be having more alerts on hot days , if not actual power outages . " <p> Intermittent outages yesterday and rolling outages on Wednesday had an impact on homes and businesses throughout the Bay Area . <p> One leading Silicon Valley enterprise , insisting that its name be kept out of print , said it lost $1 million an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No one expects the valley 's thirst for juice to diminish . If anything , experts say the local proliferation of computers and info-tech hardware will continue making the Bay Area especially susceptible to power shortages . <p> " It 's troubling , " said Terry Winter , president and chief executive of the California Independent System Operator , a nonprofit agency that oversees electricity flow throughout the state . " Things have grown faster than anyone expected . " <p> On a nationwide basis , a recent study claimed that growth in Internet use has caused computers and computer peripherals to now consume about 13 percent of available power , up from less than 1 percent in 1993 . <p> But the California Energy Commission disputed that finding , insisting that computers actually account for about 4 percent of national power consumption . <p> What is indisputable , though , is that Silicon Valley requires vast stores of electricity to power computer-intensive offices , so-called clean rooms for chip production and " server farms " in which whole buildings are given over to Internet-related data processing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how much load you can put in a building , " Winter said . <p> Along with heavy power consumption for the hardware , he noted that server farms require additional electricity for air conditioners to counter all the heat generated by the machinery . <p> In most areas across the country , power use is fairly evenly divided between industrial , commercial and residential users . But according to Silicon Valley Power , fully 90 percent of available electricity in Santa Clara goes to industrial and commercial customers . <p> And even this might not be enough . <p> Justin Bradley , director of environmental programs for the Silicon Valley Manufacturers Group , an industry organization , said a number of leading tech firms are now mulling installation of their own power plants to guarantee an uninterrupted flow of electricity . <p> Redwood Shores ' Oracle Corp . has taken the lead in this regard , recently shelling out about $6.5 million for its own plant . <p> " This is a very serious issue for the economic vitality of the valley , " Bradley said . " Infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley 's growth . " <p> Meanwhile , energy industry insiders and analysts say the current situation of high demand and low supply in Northern California will almost certainly add up to one thing : rising prices . <p> " We 've been undersupplied and the demand is just ravenous , " said Nettie Hoge , executive director of the Utility Reform Network , a grassroots organization . <p> Ironically , she said higher electricity rates may be just the incentive the energy industry needs to spur construction of new power plants , which would boost supply and , potentially , result in lower prices down the road . <p> For most California energy users , electricity rates are now frozen to stabilize the market as part of recent deregulation of the industry . The rate freeze will end next year . <p> If nothing else , this week 's outages underline the unique challenges of doing business in the Bay Area . Along with earthquake danger , clogged roads and sky-high housing costs , companies also must grapple with a less-than-reliable energy supply . <p> The California Independent System Operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that energy reserves fell below 7 percent . <p> In a Stage 1 emergency , consumers are asked to voluntarily turn off lights and assorted gadgets to reduce power use by as much as possible . In a Stage 2 emergency , reserves fall below 5 percent and power may be interrupted to some heavy users . <p> A Stage 3 emergency , which has never been called on a statewide basis , means energy reserves almost have been depleted and power to all users may be cut at any time . <p> Pacific Gas and Electric Co. was taking no chances Wednesday , cutting electricity to blocks of 35,000 Bay Area customers for as long as 90 minutes at a time . <p> The utility was instructed by the Independent System Operator to continue interrupting service to some customers from noon to 6 p.m. yesterday as hot weather persisted in inland areas . <p> " There is adequate power  --  until we get into situations that are extreme , " said Daniel Nix , deputy director of energy information and analysis for the California Energy Commission . <p> To improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only choice will be to build more power plants on the Peninsula and in the South Bay . <p> A new plant already is in the works for the San Jose area but wo n't be operational until 2002 . <p> A Silicon Valley " energy summit " organized by the manufacturers group last week focused on this trend , with representatives of local companies , utilities and government agencies comparing notes on the region 's hunger for power , so to speak . <p> A task force is expected to be formed soon to explore ways that Silicon Valley enterprises can address electricity providers ' lack of reliability . <p> " There 's one clear lesson from this week , " said Dan Richard , senior vice president of PG &E.; " We need more power generation and transmission in the area . There 's simply no other way around it . <p> RHYME AND REASON FOR ROLLING BLACKOUTS <p> Wednesday 's record-breaking heat wave caused power failures throughout the Bay Area , raising questions about the conditions that lead to rolling blackouts and the decision-making process . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk of the electricity for the Bay Area , and Patrick Dorinson of the California Independent System Operator , which oversees electricity flow throughout the state , provided these answers : <p> Q : At what stage does PG &E; institute its rotating outage program ? <p> PG &E:; " We do n't make the decision . The California ISO makes the decision . It 's to protect the integrity of the grid . " <p> ISO : " We 're required to maintain a 7 percent reserve above the forecasted load . If , for example , the forecasted load is 40,000 megawatts , we have to keep 7 percent above that in reserve . <p> " If it dips below 7 , we go to Stage 1 and issue a public appeal for conservation . If it dips below 5 , we go to Stage 2 and implement the interruptible program ( customers who agree to blackouts whenever asked in exchange for reduced rates ) . If it dips below 1.5 percent , we have to implement a firm load ( rotating outages ) and we go to Stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outages implemented locally when the ISO issued a statewide Stage 1 alert , which calls for energy conservation and voluntary shutdowns ? <p> ISO : " We had a localized problem in the Bay Area . We asked PG &E; to implement their interruptible service program , but we were still having problems , so we asked them to implement their rotating outages . Statewide , it was a Stage 1 alert , but we did n't invoke a stage in the Bay Area . We just implemented a local plan to deal with the localized problem . " <p> Q : Does PG &E; notify residents when it will be cutting off power to a neighborhood ? How much lead time does PG &E; give residents ? <p> PG &E:; " We attempt to ( notify residents ) by getting on the radio , because that is the quickest and most immediate means of reaching people . We also go on television and talk to the media as much as possible . It 's a very short lead time . It 's an hour or less . After we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . " <p> Q : What if there are circumstances in a household under which losing power could create a medical emergency ? Is there any way to get an exemption ? Where can people call to complain about a cutoff in power ? <p> PG &E:; " When the rotating outages go around , emergency services are not affected  --  hospitals , fire departments and the police . But people who are using life support systems at home have to have a backup power source , and they need to contact us ahead of time so we can arrange to give them as much lead time as possible . <p> " Outages can occur at any time , and I 'm sure they 're prepared for that . But they can call our customer service line and give them the info . Call 1-800-PGE-5000 . What they need to do is tell us what their needs are for their life support system and give us a heads up that this is happening . We have no way of knowing unless they tell us . " <p> Q : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> PG &E:; " It 's spread out throughout the entire Bay Area , and the circuits are randomly selected . They 're predetermined by the engineers . We 're looking for a particular amount of energy , not a particular number of customers . We need to drop a specific amount of load and we need to do it now . It 's whatever ( load ) the ISO tells us to cut , and it varies . " <p> Q : Are residents compensated for the loss of power ? <p> PG &E:; " We do have a claims department , and if someone feels they need to make a claim , they can do that by calling 1-800-PGE-5000 . <p> " These outages are meant to save us from larger , sustained outages . They are controlled outages that PG &E; is asked to do to save the grid . If the grid goes down , every line feeding off the grid goes down . Instead , we 're taking down small parts to save the integrity of the whole grid . " <p> E-mail David Lazarus @ @
