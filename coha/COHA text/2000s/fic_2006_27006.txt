Ransom Hill had fallen hopelessly in love with his own wife . If there was any doubt of it  --  there was n't , but had there been  --  it ended in Myrtle Beach , as he deplaned and found her waiting with the children at the gate . Tall and thinner than he 'd been since high school , Ran had on his good black coat , which still stank of cigarettes , though he 'd given them up in anticipation of this trip , the first of many sacrifices he was prepared to make . His slouching jeans were held up by a concho belt in which he 'd lately had to punch three extra holes , and his Tony Lamas clapped along with a delaminated sole . His Stetson , though  --  the new three-hundred-dollar white one he 'd seen and really felt he owed himself  --  was as crisp , serene , and towering as a late-summer cumulus . In its shadow , under memorable blue eyes , two dark crescents stood out against his inveterate New York City pallor , smudged as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for fallen rock stars and other habitual offenders . Ran , as always , was carrying two guitars , the ones Claire called " the Gibson girls " and , again , " the mistress and the wife . " His road-worn but still handsome face seemed clarified by recent suffering forwhich he had nobody but himself and maybe God to blame . As he came up the ramp , a bit short-winded , with that slapping sole , he looked like someone who had served a stretch in purgatory , and now , there , in paradisal light at the end of the square tunnel , was Claire . And paradise turned out to be South Carolina . Who could have guessed ? Amid the tourists headed for the links and Grand Strand beaches , the rushing bankers on their cells , his wife and children looked like a subversive little carnival unto themselves . Hope , his four-year-old , had on a pink dress-up with blue and silver sequins and boa trim . In dandelion-white hair tinged with the faintest faint blond rinse , her plastic tiara featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . Over the summer , her legs had sectioned out like telescopes and suddenly acquired a shape like Claire 's . At their distal ends , her nails were painted chipped hot pink . So , too , Ran saw  --  with an alarm he rapidly suppressed  --  were his son 's . Wrapped around his mother 's waist , Charlie , not quite two , had on a Cody Chestnut T-shirt with a grape juice stain and a hard-shell plastic fire hat : FDNY . As he shyly grinned with two new serrated teeth , Ran saw with a pang , for the first time , who his son was going to be , which had carved itself from formless babyhood while Daddy was away . " Dute ! Bi'truck ! " he said , and banged his plastic lid . " Fire truck , dude . " Putting down his cases , Ran took a knee , removed his hat , and raked his fingers through his sandy hair . With a hint of the grin that once upon a time had opened many doors ( quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eschew ) , he held out his arms , not quite in time to catch the kids as they smashed into him like rocket-propelled grenades . " Dad ! Da-dee ! " Hope squealed . " Hey , Sweet Pete ! " He keeled over , laughing , on his seat . " Daddy , how come you 're so skinny ? " " I 'm not skinny , am I ? " " Yes , you are . How come ? " " Bi'truck ! Bi'truck ! " Charlie said , lacking skills , but concerned to have his contribution recognized . " Man , I really like that hat , " said Ran . " I do n't suppose . . . " He commenced a swap , but it was ill-advised . " Mine ! " said Charlie , clamping down with two big little hands . Hope tugged his sleeve . " How come ? " " Well , Pete . . . " He lost her on the hesitation . " Look what I have on ! " " Umm-hmm . Tres chic , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her tone flirted with severity , as though she suspected he 'd forgotten . " I remember , " Ransom said , and now he did . " It fit you like a sack . " In New York , cruising the garment district one day in his cab , he 'd seen the item on a rolling rack disappearing up a ramp and haggled out the passenger-side window with a nervous Puerto Rican kid in a black do-rag . This was after the label dropped him ; after his well-meaning friends rallied round and got him a stint producing a band from the U of Alabama called Broken Teeth ( " the next Hootie , " they were touted as ) . After five days at the Magic Shop in SoHo , he was ready to kill them all or commit suicide , preferably both . In lieu of either , he showed up at home that night behind the wheel of a lurching , shot-shocked cab , making good a long-term threat . Five songs into an album he was hell-bent on self-producing and distributing , he bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point , he had six he had to rotate every time the promo rate expired ) . One morning he came back from the garage after a shift and found the closets empty . He sat for a long time at the kitchen table , with Claire 's bran muffin and her coffee  --  sweet and extra light  --  in a bag , before he read the note . It was on her good stationery , heavy linen stock with the address blind embossed on the verso of the envelope . Even nineteen years in a rock band could n't burn some good habits from the heart of a Charleston girl who 'd grown up south of Broad . They left in April , and Ran hit bottom , or what looked like bottom then . By that September morning in the airport , he 'd discovered that , beneath the basement , the house we know as life has several unsuspected floors ; and , below those , several more . " We missed you , Daddy , " Hope said . " I missed you , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ransom , briefly , did n't trust his voice . Sitting on the floor as the traffic veered like a stream around a rock , Ransom squeezed his children hard and smelled them like a stricken animal recovering the scent of its lost cubs , and then he opened his red eyes and looked at Claire .
