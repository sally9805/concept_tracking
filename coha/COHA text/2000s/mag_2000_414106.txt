If you ask a woman which part of her body she would most like to change , many will say " my breasts . " Rarely , it seems , are we happy with how we develop-women with large breasts want smaller ones , women with small breasts want larger ones and even women who are happy with the size of their breasts would still prefer them more firm . When it comes to changing the size or shape of their breasts , many women will consider plastic surgery . For several years now women thought that they had just one option for breast enhancement  --  implants . In 1999 some 160,000 breast implant surgeries were performed in the United States at an average cost of $4500 . But even more shocking is the fact that in 1999 over 13,000 implants were removed . Leaking , ruptured and fungus-filled implants have already destroyed the health of over 100,000 implanted women . More than 500,000 implant recipients in the United States have filed class action suits against the manufacturers . So given the exorbitant cost and hazardous side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . There is a natural alternative to consider for women who want firmer or larger breasts that will prevent them having to undergo costly , sometimes risky , surgery . This alternative is Erdic , a totally natural herbal supplement program that increases the firmness , shape and size of the breasts naturally . Developed after 16 years of research in Holland , Erdic contains extracts from buckwheat , fennel , rye , malt , barley , and three varieties of hops . Although not a miracle pill for every body , if taken correctly , 85 percent of women over 18 will enjoy from moderate to dramatic results . The estrogen receptor sites in the breast are stimulated by low doses of the plantbased estrogens or phytoestrogens , combined with other natural substances drawn from the Erdic ingredients . The effects are similar to those experienced by women during pregnancy . The phytoestrogens mimic the effects of estrogen when introduced into the human body and this helps stimulate the breast tissue growth . Phytoestrogens more closely match the body 's own hormones yet have only 11000 the estrogenic activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast tissue , then is n't it equally likely to boost malignant tissue as well , you may wonder . Because breast cancer runs in my family , I wondered the same thing and so researched the product quite thoroughly . What I learned from my Dutch contact was that Erdic had been researched for over 16 years . And out of the 100,000 women who have taken Erdic worldwide , not one has shown signs of cancer or other major side effects It may be that the phytoestrogens contained in Erdic-particularly in the special varieties of hops that are used  --  actually protect against tumors . In laboratory studies a powerful compound known as xanthohumol has been identified in hops ; it has the ability to halt the growth of breast , colon and ovarian cancer cells . Other research suggest that phytoestrogens in general play an important part in helping prevent cancer and lowering the risk of heart disease . They occur naturally in many foods we commonly ingest such as yams , apples , licorice , flax , fennel , garlic , alfalfa and soya . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the single most important variable that helps Oriental women move through the menopausal transition more easily . Many users have reported decidedly beneficial effects of Erdic , such as shinier hair , stronger , clearer skin and an enhanced sense of well-being . A small percentage did experience irregularities in their menstrual cycle for the first few months but it eventually regulated itself . Others reported a mild weight gain . So why did I become involved with Erdic ? I became involved with Erdic because over the years I have been besieged by women of all ages and stages of life who want not to only maintain breast health but also to add a cup size or two in the process . I have written about women 's issues and health concerns for nearly two decades in books such as Before the Change , Eat Fat , Lose Weight and The Living Beauty Detox Program I have frequently been asked to search out a natural breast enhancement formula . When I was first apprised of the Erdic program , like many who may be reading this article , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master 's degree in nutrition education from Columbia University , am a certified nutritional specialist , have written over 15 books and host a Web site dedicated to women 's issues . Consequently when it was suggested that I act as a spokesperson for the Erdic program I said I would if the product works , and it did . After about six weeks I began to experience results . In fact I was surprised that this natural product could have such a profound affect . All in all I am convinced that phytoestrogens play a much larger role in women 's bodies than we first realized . Phytoestrogens represent the wave of the future . From better hormone management to improved and healthier breasts , phytoestrogens may very well be the key to the Fountain of Youth for timeless and ageless feminine beauty . Why I suggest you consider the Erdic program over breast implants . Invasive surgery is required to implant these highly toxic materials in the breasts . Substances , if released into your body through leaking or rupture can generate fungus , destroy one 's quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a safe plant-based natural phytoestrogen program that mimics the effects of estrogen , stimulating glandular tissue growth within the breast receptor sites and causing the breast to become fuller and firmer . The result of larger breasts via phytoestrogens also has its bonuses . Phytoestrogens in general are considered to be cancer protective because they help displace more toxic and potent estrogens from the environment , from filling breast receptor sites and producing healthy breast tissue growth . Many women also report healthier hair , stronger nails and clearer skin as a result of the Erdic program . Researched for nearly 20 years , Erdic has been sold globally for the past five years . Over 100,000 women to date have completed the Erdic program successfully and of the women who have used Erdic , 85 percent claim the product has either firmed or enlarged their breasts .
