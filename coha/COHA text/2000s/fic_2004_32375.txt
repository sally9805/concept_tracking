The Barbarian By Judith E. French Dorchester Publishing Judith E. French The Mediterranean Sea Spring , 315 B.C. The flame-haired woman hung suspended between life and death , each breath coming when all hope of another had failed . So faint was her heartbeat that the Phoenician physician despaired of ever seeing the face of his young son again . His mysterious patient would die before the ship ever reached Alexandria , and the sole of pharaoh 's sandal would grind him into the Egyptian sand as mercilessly as if he were the smallest cockroach . The poison had been too strong . He had feared the dose was too powerful when he mixed it , but the stakes were high . The Macedonian general , Cassander , had ordered the prisoner 's death , and Ptolemy , pharaoh of Egypt in all but name , ruler of Cyprus , master of the greatest navy that the world had ever known , had demanded that he bring her to him in Alexandria alive and unspoiled . Only one ancient poison was reputed to plunge a man so deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never tried on beast or human , let alone a woman . He dipped a sponge into a basin of vinegar and fresh water , squeezed it , and wiped the beads of sweat from the lady 's brow . So fair she was , that it seemed the rays of the sun had never touched her alabaster face , but whether the hue of her complexionwas that of death 's approach or her natural color , he was at a loss to tell . He leaned close , so close that his lips brushed her ear lobe . " Live , lady , " he whispered . " Live so that you might taste the wine of Egypt on your tongue ... that the sound of a baby 's laughter might bring joy to your ears . Live ... " She was no untouched virgin , nor was she in the first flush of womanhood . Yet , she was not old , certainly no more than twenty ... and she had given birth to a child . Her face was unlined by age or weather , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim of the western sea . The woman 's boldly etched cheekbones were high ; dark brows arched gracefully over long , thick , lashes that fluttered at rare intervals to reveal wide , almond-shaped eyes of cinnamon scattered with flakes of raw gold . His mouth went dry as his gaze rested on her sensual lips ... lips so perfectly shaped that they would tempt a man to risk his soul to taste . Her body ... Sweat trickled down his face , and he swallowed , attempting to dissolve the thickening in his throat ... clamping back the primal need that fired his blood and turned his phallus hard and pulsing . He flushed with shame . Was he not trained to put aside his human urges in order to heal the sick and afflicted ? The woman was dying . What physician would sink so low as to allow base urges to cloud his reason ? But the lush curves of her sweetly formed breasts and hips , the silken texture of her skin , and the feminine glory of that thick mane of shimmering auburn hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapely ... her calves ... The physician rose to his feet , closed his eyes , and inhaled deeply , drawing in the pungent odors of sea and ship , letting the familiar sounds of creaking timbers , groaning oarsmen , and snapping canvas remind him of where he was and why . Making the sign of the blessed lady Asherah for protection , he moved away from the woman , wondering if she were a sorceress who had bewitched his senses . With a foul curse , he scrambled up a ladder to the splintery deck and let the salt spray and wind blow the shadows from his mind . * * * She tossed restlessly on the mat , caught in a tangle of nightmares and memories . Images swirled ; the face of a golden-haired man flashed before her and faded in shadow , his familiar voice drowned out by the snarl of a hunting leopard and the granite etched features of another man , dark , with eyes as fierce and haunting as those of the great cat . Wind and snow whipped through rugged mountain passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desert wasteland as lines of grim-faced soldiers struggled through knee-deep sand beneath the burning disk of a pitiless sun . She tried to cry out , but her lips were cracked and her parched throat was as dry as the empty riverbeds . She could not summon the strength to run or even to raise her head . Her fingers , once strong enough to control the reins of rearing stallion lay limp and motionless . Only her eyelids fluttered , clenching tight against the onslaught of thundering hooves and blood-streaked swords ... opening to see towering city walls rise and crumble to wind-blown dust . And always the golden man returned , his powerful arms lifting her , his whispers sweet in her ear . She groaned , struggling for each breath , feeling her will to fight seeping away , sensing the cool night of eternal oblivion that waited to swallow her . " Come , " he whispered . " Take my hand and come away with me . Away from pain and darkness . " Pain surged in her head , plunging her world into chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tangled roots . She struggled to breathe , gasping for air , and screaming soundlessly . In her torment a pinpoint of light flared and blossomed into a world of radiant blue sky and green Sogdian meadow . She could smell the sweetness of wildflowers , see the vivid reds and yellow petals , and hear the clear , bright song of birds . And across the valley , pranced a magnificent black horse carrying a golden rider . Nearer and nearer they came , the man 's gilded hair and horse 's ebony mane and tail rippling in the gentle wind . The golden man beckoned . " It 's time . " Strength flowed through her as she reached out , easily extending the hand that had been so weak only an instant before . " Trust me , " he called . " No ! " Kayan sat bolt upright and shoved away the wolf skin blanket . So real . She had been so real . Her scent still lingered in his nostrils . With a curse , he rose naked from the bed and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white moonlight pour into the room . Footfalls pounded in the stone passageway . The door banged open , and a servant stood clutching a torch in one hand , a sword in the other . " Prince ? I heard- " " You heard nothing ! " " But , I " Kayan drew back a clenched fist . " Leave me ! " Mumbling excuses , the intruder fled . The torchlight dimmed and vanished , leaving the chamber in darkness . Kayan turned again to the open window , heedless of the frigid wind that chilled his sweat-sheened skin and hair . His eyes ached for lack of sleep . His gut churned . Would the pain never recede ? Would he live on in torment , eking out the hours and days listening for her footfall ... looking for her face around every corner ? Would she haunt his dreams ? And if he could banish her from his heart and mind , would it leave him as empty as a drained wine bladder ? If only he could remember his dreams . That they were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still feel her skin against his , taste her mouth , hear her laughter . Did she come to tell him that she was safe in the heaven of Ormazd 's peace ? Or did the evil god Abriman hold her captive in his dark kingdom ? ( Continues ... ) by Judith E. French
