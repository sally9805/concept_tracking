The Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory ( SAEI ) and the Student-Athlete Gains Inventory ( SAGI ) were administered to 217 student-athletes . An exploratory factor analyses ( EFA ) on the 65-item SAEI resulted in a reduced inventory of 39-items and three factors named assorted experiences , social interaction , and academic experience . An EFA on the 17-item SGI resulted in a 12-item inventory and two factors named practical arts gain and liberal arts gain . For purposes of establishing predictive validity of the SAEI , the relationship between student-athlete experiences ( three factors ) and perceived student gains ( two factors ) was evaluated by subjecting the data to a canonical correlation analysis . The structural coefficients between the three SAEI factors and SAGI factors suggested a meaningful relationship between experiences and gains . It was concluded that the SAEI has a three-factor structure and that it provides a reliable and valid measurement of student-athlete experiences . <p> The experiences of college age students have been studied relative to perceived student outcomes and gains ( Pascarella &; Terenzini , 1981 ; Pike , 1995 ; Pike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( involvement ) and academic gains has focused upon the general student population and not upon the student-athlete subgroup . Pike ( 1999 ) studied student experiences and academic gains as a function of residence hall type and reported that students in on-campus residential learning communities had significantly higher levels of involvement , interaction , and academic gains than students living in traditional residence halls . Kuh and Hu ( 2001 ) studied the academic gains and learning experiences of undergraduates at research universities compared to other comprehensive colleges and universities . Results showed that research universities compare favorably with comprehensive universities in terms of undergraduate education , with a noticeable improvement over the last decade . <p> Specific to the student-athlete group , those who work with or assist student-athletes are recognizing the potentially negative impact of an athlete 's extra-curricular obligations on personal , academic , and vocational development . The literature on the intercollegiate athletic experience generally points to a negative relationship between the athletic experience and outcomes such as career maturity , clarity in educational and occupational plans , and principled moral judgement ( Blann , 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1987 ; Martens &; Cox , 2000 ; Sowa &; Gressard , 1983 ; Stone &; Strange , 1989 ) . Student-athletes who invest more of themselves in the role of an athlete and who possess a stronger athletic identity have been shown to experience more anxiety regarding career exploration ( Grove , Lavalle , &; Gordon , 1997 ) . As a result of anxious feelings , student-athletes are less likely to take a proactive approach in their academic and vocational development . Accordingly , Martens and Lee ( 1998 ) suggested that it is improbable that the majority of collegiate student-athletes will ever voluntarily seek out university career centers for vocational assistance . Considering the time commitment and multi-faceted obligations of student-athletes , it is plausible to assume that even if a student-athlete were looking to grow academically and/or engage in career exploration , he or she simply may not have the time or energy to do so . Sowa and Gressard ( 1983 ) supported such an assertion by suggesting that career planning for athletes is an individual developmental task that athletes have difficulty with due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Having recognized the challenges of the academic experience for student-athletes , many college athletic departments have developed " total person programs " designed to assist athletes in academic and career pursuits . The goal of these programs is to help athletes succeed athletically while at the same time helping them succeed academically , socially , and in developing a viable career either within or outside of sport . Experiences that student-athletes have while in college will likely affect the degree to which they are successful in these important areas . <p> The purpose of this study was to develop a Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory ( SAEI ) that would adequately measure the experiences of collegiate athletes . To date , the primary instrument that has been used to measure college student experiences is the College Student Experiences Questionnaire ( CSEQ ; Pace , 1990 ; Pace &; Kuh , 1998 ) . The CSEQ assesses information about the individual ( demographics ) , college related experiences , opinions about college , the college environment , and the individual 's perceived estimate of gains . The college experiences component of the CSEQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 136-items . Initially our research group thought that the CSEQ could be utilized to measure student-athlete college experiences , but after careful study it became apparent that the CSEQ was too long and that many of the items within categories were often redundant . Furthermore , because it does not appear that the CSEQ has been subjected to either an exploratory ( ERA ) or confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) , it is not known if the 14 subsections could be factor analyzed into 14 latent variables , or if some other factor structure would emerge . Rather than simply developing a brief version of the CSEQ we chose to completely rewrite the items and to only include items that we felt were relevant to the student-athlete . In our preliminary 65-item inventory , only five items actually included words such as athlete , coach , or sport . In the final 39-item inventory , only three items contained these words . This was by design , so that with minor modification the inventory could be used with a non-athlete group for the purpose of generating comparison scores . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliability , and criterion validity of the SAEI is reported in this article . <p> While the development and testing of the SAEI was our primary research goal , the development and testing of the companion Student-Athlete Gains Inventory ( SAGI ) was of parallel importance in order to establish the criterion validity of the SAEI . We felt that a valid experiences inventory would be able to predict a student-athlete 's perceived academic gains . If it could , this would be evidence of the criterion validity of the SAEI . We recognize , however , that this is only the first step in establishing the validity of the SAEI . Method <p> Participants <p> Participants for this investigation were 150 male and 67 female ( N=217 ) athletes from a large Midwest university . The sample was represented by athletes from the sports of baseball ( n=1 ) , men 's basketball ( n=4 ) , women 's basketball ( n=9 ) , football ( n=96 ) , women 's golf ( n=3 ) , soccer ( n=8 ) , softball ( n=l ) , swimming and diving ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track and field ( n=54 ) , volleyball ( n=14 ) , wrestling ( n=21 ) , and other ( n=2 ) . Missing data were observed for one football player . Therefore the actual sample used for analysis included 216 athletes . Within the total sample , 26% represented persons of color and 74% were European American . Specific to class standing , 22% were freshmen , 29% were sophomores , 27% were juniors , 17% were seniors , 4% were fifth year seniors , and 1% were graduate students . <p> Materials <p> As described below , two different inventories were presented to participants . The first inventory was the actual 65-item Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory ( SAEI ) , and the second was the Student-Athlete Gains Inventory ( SAGI ) . <p> Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory ( SAEI ) . While the CSEQ ( Pace , 1990 ; Pace &; Kuh , 1998 ) was composed of 136 items and 14 grouped categories , the preliminary version of the SAEI was composed of 65 randomly distributed items that represented 13 categories of college experiences written specifically for a student-athlete population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evaluated by the six members of the research team . Items judged to be redundant , poorly conceived or worded were eliminated , resulting in 65 items and 13 categories . The 13 categories of experiences were as follows : library use , instructor interactions , course work , student union , clubs and organizations , student acquaintances , reading experiences , writing activities , speaking activities , personal experiences , use of computer , discussing or dealing with career issues , and independent thinking . Each of the SAEI 13 categories of experiences was composed of five items that were randomly distributed throughout the 65-item inventory . Eight of the 13 categories were similar to eight of the 14 categories addressed in the 136-item CSEQ , but five categories were relatively unique to the SAEI ( i.e. , discussing or dealing with career issues , use of computer , independent thinking , reading experiences , speaking experiences ) . In responding to items , participants were asked to indicate how often they had had a particular experience via a 4-point scale ( 1=never or almost never , 2=occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Student-Athlete Gains Inventory ( SAGI ) . In conjunction with the SAEI , participants completed a 17-item Student-Athlete Gains Inventory ( SAGI ) . For each gain ( outcome ) , the participant was asked to indicate on a four point scale the degree to which they realized the gain ( l=not at all , 2=somewhat , 3=greatly , 4=definitely ) over the past identified semester . These 17 gain statements were patterned after the 23 gains that appear in the CSEQ inventory and are representative of gains/outcomes that are typically realized by the student-athlete . The 17 gain statements , however , were not meant to represent an exhaustive list of student-athlete gains . As with the SAEI , each item on the gains inventory was carefully reviewed by members of the research team . As with the SAEI , the SAGI was developed so that with minor adjustments it could be used with non-athletes for the purpose of making score comparisons . <p> Procedure <p> After receiving approval from the campus Institutional Review Board , the investigators approached coaches from 15 sports and asked for their permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving permission , the investigators presented each athlete with a brief overview of the study and asked for his/her voluntary participation . No inducement was offered for participation in the study . Accordingly , it was made clear that failure to volunteer to participate in the study would not result in any type of retribution from their coaches or the investigators . Inventories described in the materials section were presented to each participant in either a team meeting or a one-on-one situation . Prior to completing the inventories , participants were informed of the voluntary nature of the research and that it would take approximately 15-min to answer all the questions . While 15 athletic teams were invited to participate , the greatest cooperation was received from the football team , women 's basketball team , track and field , women 's volleyball , and wrestling . In all inventory packets , the SAEI preceded the SAGI so that experiences were requested first followed by gains . <p> Statistical Analyses <p> Descriptive statistics , including means , standard deviations , and skewness/kurtosis indices were calculated for each item on the SAEI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the factor-structure of both inventories . Cronbach 's alpha was calculated to establish the internal consistency of the total scale as well as for each identifiable factor . The relationship between SAEI and SAGI sub-scales was ascertained using canonical correlation . In this regard , standardized canonical coefficients and structural coefficients were examined . Results <p> Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory <p> SAEI items were subjected to screening procedures to test for skewness and kurtosis . Based on the results of screening , it was observed that three items exhibited skewness or kurtosis indices that were greater that 2.00 . These three items were " used a computer to send and receive e-mail messages " , " used a computer to type a term paper or project for a class " , and " used a computer to access the World Wide Web . " The skewness indices of the three items ranged from 2.49 to 3.13 , while the kurtosis indices ranged from 6.39 to 8.9 . The reason the kurtosis scores were so high was because 80 to 90% of the participants responded " very often " to these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62-item SAEI was subjected to an exploratory factor analysis using the PROC FACTOR statement in SAS . <p> A common factor exploratory factor analysis ( EFA ) was completed using a principal axis extraction method . After conducting the initial EFA , a three-factor promax ( correlated ) rotation solution was sought based on careful scrutinizing of eigenvalues , eigenvalue proportions , a scree plot , and a consideration of meaningfulness of factors . Using the promax ( oblique ) rotated pattern matrix , items that loaded .40 or greater on a factor were retained , while items that double loaded on more than one factor were deleted . An additional inclusion criteria was that a retained item had to have a factor loading of at least . 15 greater than its loading on any other factor . This process resulted in 18-items for factor one ( assorted experiences ) , 11-items for factor two ( social interaction experiences ) , and 10-items for factor three ( academic experiences ) . The inter-factor correlation coefficients between factor one and two , one and three , and two and three were .30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of total variance accounted for by factors one , two , and three was 13% , 8% , and 8% respectively . Total variance accounted for by the three factors combined was 29% . Proportion of common variance ( covariance ) accounted for by factors one , two , and three was 44% , 28% , and 28% respectively . Factor loadings from the rotated promax pattern matrix as well as means and standard deviations for each retained item are displayed in Table I. Calculated Cronbach alphas for factors one , two and three were .89 , .79 and .82 respectively . The overall Cronbach alpha for all 39 items combined was .91 . The final 39 item SAEI , with scoring key , is found in appendix A. <p> Student-Athlete Gains Inventory <p> The 17-items of the SAGI were subjected to screening procedures to test for skewness and kurtosis . Based on the results of screening , it was observed that item-17 exhibited a kurtosis index of 2.43 and was deleted from further analyses . One reason kurtosis of this item was high was because the majority ( 60% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement " Learned how to be independent and to make decisions on my own . " Using the same procedures described above for the SAEI , the remaining 16-item SAGI was subjected to an exploratory factory analysis . This procedure resulted in a 2-factor solution , with 6-items loading on factor one ( practical gain ) and 6-items loading on factor two ( liberal arts gain ) . Proportion of total variance accounted for by factors one and two was 19 and 18% respectively . Combined , factor one and two accounted for 37% of the total variability of items . Proportion of common variance ( covariance ) accounted for by factor one and two was 52 and 48% respectively . The inter-factor correlation between practical gain ( factor 1 ) and liberal arts gain ( factor 2 ) was .58 . The internal reliability of the instrument was estimated by calculating Cronbach alphas . The alpha for practical gain was .81 while for liberal arts gain it was .78 . The internal reliability for all retained items together was .84 . Factor loadings from the rotated promax pattern matrix as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are displayed in Table 2 . Finally , because we were particularly interested in gains related to career development , it is important to note that five of the six items that loaded on " practical gain " were career related . The final 12-item SAGI , with scoring key , is found in appendix B. <p> Predictive Validity of the SAEI <p> Theoretically , the SAEI should be able to predict student outcomes or educational gains . The ability of the SAEI to do this would be one indicator of the predictive or criterion validity of the instrument ( Ellis , 1994 ) . We were specifically interested in how well the SAEI could predict gains associated with career development . It was for this reason that the student-athletes were asked to complete the Student-Athlete Gains Inventory ( SAGI ) . <p> Without regard to gender , class or sport , the relationship between student-athlete experiences ( three factors ) and perceived student gains ( two factors ) was evaluated by subjecting the data to a canonical correlation analysis . Results of this analysis yielded two canonical variates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second was not . The squared canonical correlation for the first canonical variate was .23 . Focusing attention upon the first canonical variate , the standardized canonical coefficients for factors one , two and three of the SAEI were .03 , .58 , and .60 respectively . The standardized canonical coefficients for factors one and two of the SAGI were .43 and .72 respectively . The structural coefficients for the three factors of the SAEI were .56 , .82 , and .84 ; while for the two factors of the SAGI they were .78 and .92 . Structural coefficients greater than .30 are considered to be meaningful ( Tabachnick &; Fidell , 2001 , p. 199 ) . The results of the canonical correlation analysis show a meaningful relationship between student-athlete experiences and educational gains . The details of the canonical correlation analysis are displayed in Table 3 . Discussion <p> Because the initial 65-item Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory ( SAEI ) was composed of items from 13 discrete categories , we expected that 13 discrete factors might emerge from the exploratory factor analysis ( EFA ) . Rather , the EFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three factors titled " assorted experiences " , " social interaction experiences " and " academic experiences . " Items that loaded on social interaction and academic experience were decidedly social and academic in nature , but items that loaded on factor 1 were a mixture of experiences that might be considered a shallow melange . <p> One can hypothesize that the education related experiences of a student-athlete should be somewhat related to educational gains and outcomes . To this end we created an instrument composed of 17 discrete educational gains and asked athletes to rate the degree to which these educational gains and outcomes were realized . A factor analysis of the Student-Athlete Gains Inventory resulted in two factors named " practical gains " and " liberal arts gains . " <p> To determine the predictive validity of the SAEI , we studied the relationship between sub-scales on the SAEI with sub-scales on the SAGI . This was accomplished using canonical correlation . While some of the structural coefficients for the first canonical variate were smaller than others , all were meaningful and greater than .30 . The results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student-athlete experiences and student outcomes ( gains ) . The strongest associations were between social and academic experience with liberal arts gain . The association , however , between these two SAEI factors and practical application gain was also quite strong . Based on this information one can surmise that student-athletes who experience academia as well as social interactions during college are more likely to realize both practical and liberal arts kinds of gains . From this , we conclude that the SAEI demonstrates strong predictive validity . <p> While all three of the SAEI factors were meaningfully related to liberal arts and practical gains , it is of interest that the two experience factors defined as academic or social in nature were more predictive of gains than the factor titled " assorted experiences . " Apparently , the student-athlete who has an assortment of experiences does not realize academic and practical gains to the same degree as the individual who focuses upon either social or academic pursuits . Perhaps a failure to focus on academics or social experiences results in a melange of shallow experiences that do not translate into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SAEI resulted in a three-factor structure , it should be of value to select out items that are homogenous in nature to see if they are predictive of selected gains . For example , items 3 , 21 , 22 , 29 and 36 of the SAEI ( see appendix A ) all relate specifically to the library and could be grouped as a single predictor of some aspect of student-athlete gain ( outcome ) . <p> While considering the time commitment and extra-curricular obligations of student-athletes that have been observed by researchers , results from this study indicate that the academic and social experiences that are afforded by student athletes do have a beneficial influence on their overall development . Individuals who assist student-athletes with their academic and personal development needs ( e.g. , vocational exploration , community outreach ) can use this awareness to create and implement appropriate experiences for their student-athletes . Moreover , the Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory may be a potential tool used to evaluate the effectiveness of programs ( e.g. , a total person program ) that have been created to facilitate student-athlete academic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the use of a homogenous sample from one large Midwest University . Moreover , although study participants represented all major sports from the cooperating athletic department , relative sample sizes for each sport were not equal . The utilization of such a sample warrants caution when generalizing results to other student-athlete populations as the experiences and subsequent gains characteristic of one college environment may be vastly different compared to those of other college environments . Accordingly , we recommend that further investigations of the reliability and validity of the Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory should include participants representing more than one university and relatively equal numbers of members from all sports as well as both genders . <p> An additional limitation of the research relates to the manner in which validity of the SAEI was determined . While correlating student-athlete experiences with gains offers some insight into the predictive validity of the SAEI , this can only be viewed as a first step in the process of establishing the overall construct validity of the instrument . To further validate the instrument , future research should examine the relationship of the SAEI to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constructs related to student-athlete experiences . <p> In summary , we conclude that the Student-Athlete Experiences Inventory has a three-factor structure and that it provides a reliable and valid measurement of student-athlete experiences . Future research should focus upon confirming the theoretical three-factor structure of the SAEI and studying the effect that college related experiences have upon educational outcomes and gains , career situation , and principled moral behavior . If it can be determined that a certain pattern of student-athlete experiences has a positive effect upon graduation rate , career maturity and educational outcome , it might be possible to provide educational interventions that would benefit the student-athlete .
