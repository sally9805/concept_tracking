1 The Funeral When we pulled off in the station wagon to head home to St. Louis , Granmama stood in the wake of dirt and rocks waving , her black hair blowing violently in the wind of the storm that we were leaving . I watched Granmama from the back of the station wagon until first her copper skin faded into the colors of the landscape , and then the speck that was her dress drifted , as if blown by the wind , out of the road and up the stairs of her front porch . That was the last time I saw her . Granmama 's funeral was held in the church where she had taken us on summer Sundays . The church stood tall and blinding white in the middle of a stretch of orange Mississippi dirt . Our family sat on the front pew , and because I was the baby , I sat next to Mama , holding her arm tight while my sisters and brothers sat quietly with their eyes wide open . Mama and the aunts wore veils , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun filtered through the stained-glass window , breaking the light into streams of orange and yellow where dust particles floated like dandelion seeds . Our Grandeddy sat on the elder 's pew at the front of the church . The wood dipped where he sat rocking to the soothing sound of the choir . He was the fattest black man I ever knew , and in the stained-glass light , he was so black , he was almost purple . The whites of his eyes were yellow like yolks . I stared at his face full of misery and regret for the woman that I never saw him hug or kiss . Their relationship was a lot like Mama and Deddy 's , always cutting each other down with a list of regrets , but the babies came like seasons . That day Grandeddy 's face was hard and cold , not grinning behind a sip of white lightning like it usually was . In his white shirt and suspenders he looked worn , his age dusty on his black skin . I rocked with him and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shift in things that would help me understand what was happening . He rolled the program tighter and tighter where the roughness of his hands against the paper sounded faint behind the harmony of the choir . Their voices lifted into the beams of the church and resonated inside my chest . Walk the streets of glo-ry Let me lift my voice ... The sweetness of the voices pushed Mama and the aunts into sobs and tears that sent me into tears , and I struggled to get around Mama 's shaking arms and into her lap . The adults fanned themselves to the beat , moaning like Granmama 's cow when Grandeddy took her calf and sold it down the road . I watched Grandeddy . The music paused , and the reverend stood . His voice echoed in the rafters . " He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me . He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it . " He wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the choir to hum the procession song . People lined up to look in the casket , like they were lining up for communion . There we all sat waiting , me , the littlest Blackburn . The church framed us , my two sisters and two brothers , cousins , aunts , uncles , all the descendants of Grandeddy . A tall , sturdy woman walked by in the procession and looked into my eyes . She lifted me from Mama 's side , just swooped down like a hawk . When Mama looked up and saw through tears and veil that this woman was taking me to view the body , she pushed her veil up and yelled , but I can not remember the sound that came from her mouth , because the humming had turned to singing , and somebody was shouting out the Holy Spirit in front of the casket , but when this woman looked into my eyes , the singing and moaning were muted . She looked down at Granmama and whispered in my ear , " Do n't you never forget her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love you because she could n't love her own . " I did n't recognize the voice that sounded so much like Granmama 's , but let my three-year-old ear linger there on what felt familiar , her breath warm like comfort where nothing else made sense . In the still of that moment I could smell Granmama 's perfume , the perfume she only wore to church . She was resting in her yellow dress . The yellow dress that had yellow lace flowers over yellow satin , the dress that hung in her cedar wardrobe , the dress that she would put my hand on and say , " Flowers . Fl-ow-ers , " and I would see in my mind the tall yellow sunflowers that had grown up among the weeds behind her house . I reached for her , but her hands were gray , not brown and pink , and her face was gray and dusty . She did not reach for me , and I did not know this woman in Granmama 's dress . On the train back to St. Louis I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? " but she stared straight ahead , moving only when the train jostled her . I let go of her arm and braced myself as I crossed the aisle . My oldest brother , Lamont , pulled me up on his lap . At nine he seemed to understand things like a grown-up . I asked , " Where Deddy ? " He answered me while looking out the window , " Who cares ? " " When we goin back to Granmama house ? " In the reflection I did n't see his face change , but I put my hand on his cheek to turn it to me , and felt heat rise up to his temples . Warm tears rolled over my hand , and he mumbled , " Granmama 's dead . " I heard the voice of my big sister Towanda , the day she ran home and said , " There was a fight after school in dead man 's alley , " and Mama saying , " A nigga ai n't worth a damn less he 's dead . " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and candy wrappers , muddy storm water washing over her . I leaned against Lamont 's chest and cried at the window too . I was always crying , and clinging to Mama like death would sneak up and take her away . Unlike my four older siblings , I always walked because running meant falling , and falling released blood , blood released tears , pain spewing up from some churning ulcer inside of me that nobody understood . People stopped blaming my fragile state on the fact that I was born in Mississippi one summer and was Granmama 's favorite , and it hurt me more than the other kids when she died . Mama said , " She 's always cried a lot . " Mama did n't seem to mind my constant tears unless we were at church or at a barbeque and one of the aunts commented , " Lord , that chile done sprung a leak again , " then Mama would yank me out of the fray of flying baseballs , jump ropes , and drunk uncles , and say , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " Usually I cried softly for an additional hour , so none of the aunts would want to sit and talk to Mama , just like none of the kids wanted to play with me . My oldest sister , Towanda , nicknamed me " cry baby-baby , " because I was unlike my sisters and brothers , who had their legs planted firmly under them like young oaks with deep roots reaching beneath the asphalt . They ran up and down the streets of West St. Louis , falling and bruising without the slightest grimace . When Lamont dragged Towanda , Roscoe , and LaVern through the gangway in the red wagon , their ashy brown legs with dirty sneakers dangled . Their knees scraped against the brick of our house and the grainy tar-paper shingles of the neighbors ' house-their laughter louder than the pain of scabby knees . My mama could tell a story . Where Deddy did n't have much to say about his childhood , Mama made up for it with stories about hers . And when she told stories about something bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , or throwing her head back in a big laugh with her gold tooth shining . The story about how she got that tooth was one of my favorites . " I was in Bo 's car flyin up to West Point to pick up my girlfriend . We was goin to my graduation dance , and the car caught a patch of gravel , and the next thing , my forehead was stuck in the glass of the windshield , and blood was pouring from where my real tooth used to be . " That 's where she laughed , loud like Grandeddy , holding on to a door frame , a chair arm , a kid 's shoulder , whatever was nearest . In the living room there is a black-and-white photo of Mama on the hi-fi . She is in a white dress , sitting in the dirt next to the car . She is posing , smiling , her dress ballooned around her . Her round face is in contrast to the white bandage that is wrapped around her forehead . Grandeddy 's new car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its front crumpled like papers . When I look at the photo , I can see the whole accident , just the way Mama describes it . When Mama tells the story about Granmama dying , it is n't funny at all . I sat on the front steps thigh to thigh with her . Mama watered our small lawn and hummed church songs in a low sweet voice , while Lamont , Towanda , Roscoe , and LaVern ran up and down Kennedy Avenue with the other neighborhood kids , trying to get the last bit of play in before it got too dark and Mama said come in . The smell of dry earth dampened by cool city water filled my lungs , and I sat and listened to her talk to our neighbors , who sat on their steps , watering their lawns in the same sweeping motion . Most of the grown-ups in our neighborhood had moved up from Mississippi at some point , and they always wanted to know what was happening back home . Mama shook her head and retold the story . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South when it happened , but Bo said Mother took one look at where he cut his self cleaning them fish and just lost her mind tryin to stop the bleeding . " I made pictures in my mind while Mama talked , trying to see Granmama running all over her house , long arms reached to grab rags , quilt squares , whatever she could to stop the bleeding . I imagined my retarded cousin Neckbone being there . He was always present when bad stuff happened , but never made it into the retelling of the story . I could hear Granmama 's footsteps from the kitchen to the bathroom , and Neckbone stood at Granmama 's out-of-tune piano , trying to find the notes to " Wade in the Water , " his nervous , callused feet shifting from side to side on Granmama 's wooden floor . " Bo tried to tell her to calm down . He bled all over the table , but he was n't hurting none . Lord , Lord . " Mama shook her head , but kept up the steady sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom to try to rinse and squeeze the rags , and she clutched her chest right there and had a heart attack . Bo 's blood was all over the bathroom , and all over her dress . She never could stand the sight of blood . " I listened , rocking now , to music from the funeral : What  --  can wash away  --  all my sins Nothing  --  but the blood  --  of Jesus ... And I saw in my mind Grandeddy wringing the program , Granmama 's obituary scraping over the crusty insides of the hands he had cut up with a fishing knife , but there were no bandages . Death , blood , Jesus , my cousin Neckbone standing over Granmama singing " Go Tell It on the Mountain , " words and images put together like puzzle pieces that made a picture of logic for Mama and the neighbors , but in my brain they swam around like tadpoles trying to find a place to settle .                  @ @ @
