<p> The union of a storm trooper and a Jedi princess ? Sacrilege ! <p> Geek love , though , knows no allegiance , be it Rebel or Imperial . <p> " She 's the best wife ever , " said Evan Reynolds . " I feel like I won the lottery every day with her . " <p> His bride 's take is a bit more pragmatic . <p> " People say we 're nerds , " said Karen Reynolds . " We are . " <p> The Reynoldses are a love story wrapped in plastic , PVC and the trappings of science fiction fantasy . <p> If ever two people were destined to be together , this pair certainly qualifies based on taste alone . <p> " It 's like fate , a match-made-in-heaven kind of thing , " said friend and fellow costumer Joey MorganCQ . " None of us knew each other before we found a simple , common connection : We enjoy costuming . " <p> Both Evan and Karen are voracious fans of science fiction entertainment and have taken their love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend hours  --  and countless dollars  --  replicating the look and style of their favorite fantasy characters . The hobby , formally called " costuming , " is a meticulously detailed and precise passion . <p> While many couples ' closets are littered with a clutter of T-shirts and linens , the Reynoldses ' have a stylized collection of costumes that appear to have jumped off the big screen : <p> A dead-on cloak like Neo 's in " The Matrix Reloaded . " Princess Leia 's infamous metal bikini from " The Empire Strikes Back . " The collection cost thousands to assemble , with many outfits tailored at a specialty shop in Canada . <p> These outfits do n't gather dust on hangers . The couple showcase their garb at movie theaters , fund-raisers and science fiction conventions across the Southeast . <p> " We do Toys for Tots every year for the Marine Corps , " Evan said . " Karen and I are big into the multiple sclerosis walk . We walk in full storm trooper armor for five kilometers , and we 'll be doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause Karen is very involved in . " <p> They also visit local children 's hospitals , such as Children 's Healthcare at Scottish Rite , dressed as storm troopers to entertain children . Evan , who is also a magician and performs at local restaurants , visits with fellow magic folk to entertain patients with his sleight of hand . <p> The two met , appropriately , while working  --  in costume  --  at the Netherworld Haunted House in Norcross two years ago . He was outfitted as a storm trooper , she as Trinity from " The Matrix . " <p> They saw something kindred beneath the masks and layers of latex . " She figured out I was a nerd pretty early on , " he joked . <p> The moment of kismet did n't explode into passion immediately . Evan helped Karen build her storm trooper armor before they began dating , a unique form of foreplay if ever there was one . <p> " He just charmed me right off the bat , " she said . " We were both working the line at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the night I was going to be in love with him . " <p> At the opening of " The Matrix Revolutions " at the Regal Mall of Georgia 20 in Buford last December , the pair dressed as uncanny versions of the film 's lead characters  --  Neo and Trinity  --  greeting patrons at the entrance of the theater with the style and demeanor of celebrity impersonators . <p> Their fee ? Zero . They spent 12 hours at the theater mingling with opening-day crowds just for the experience . <p> " They 're trying to get people in , and we like showing off what we worked on , " she said . " Plus , we got to see the movie three times . " <p> This is , obviously , a love rarer than an original Han Solo action figure in mint packaging , so the two decided to make it formal  --  with their own splash of style . <p> On Karen 's birthday last July , Evan proposed with a lollipop ring . Karen later picked out the engagement band she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative gesture compared with the wedding . <p> Last Halloween ( of course ) , the two wed at Karen 's mother 's home in Dunwoody . Karen wore a Trinity costume with white vinyl blended into the skirt . Evan was outfitted as Vash the Stampede from the manga cartoon " Trigun , " complete with silver frosted hair . <p> A friend dressed as Darth Vader gave the bride away . A magician officiated at the ceremony . The groom 's cake : a frosted image of R2-D2 . <p> " Neither one of us wanted a fancy wedding , " Karen said . " We wanted something we would like and our friends would like . " <p> The ceremony wo n't be forgotten any time soon . <p> " Everybody was in a wonderful mood , and everything was sci-fi themed , " said Paul Sponaugle , a well-known local magician who served as Evan 's best man . " It 's kind of hard to describe . It was freaky . If you 're into sci-fi and fantasy , it was the wedding of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better wedding to be at . We had a bleeding pumpkin made of cheesecake and raspberry . " <p> Among the costumed guests : an Alex from " A Clockwork Orange , " a male guest dressed like Marilyn Monroe and a Capt . Jack Sparrow from " Pirates of the Caribbean . " <p> Following the blessed event , it was back to reality , of sorts . Evan works as a senior programmer for an Internet security company . Karen is the manager of a Starbucks Coffee in Dunwoody . <p> But costuming absorbs their free time . <p> Karen 's workspace in their home is devoted to sci-fi trappings , especially those of Trinity . There are statues , costumes and replicas of the sunglasses the character wore in the film . Her husband even purchased her the rare and pricey cellphone model the character wielded in the " Matrix " films . <p> " I 'm more passionate about her than any character , " Karen said . " She 's strong , intelligent , faithful and brave . " <p> But it takes more than " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two are members of the 501st Storm Trooper Legion , a group of " Star Wars " devotees who outfit themselves as storm troopers to meet , socialize and help a needy cause . <p> Yet even those who relish fantasy eventually need to settle down . Earlier this month , the Reynoldses purchased their first home , a 2,500-square-foot nest in Canton . Karen has a sewing room where she can craft her costumes . Evan has his own library and a garage where he can store the hardware involved in his hobby . <p> He just completed a replica of the helmet from " The Rocketeer " and is finishing off the rest of the costume . Karen is sewing together a sexy , form-fitting outfit to resemble ' 50s bad girl Bettie Page 's get-up . <p> " I 'm working on Bettie Page and a bunch of historical gowns for the summer , " she said . " There 's a big costume event called Costume Con in April in Decatur . It 's purely dedicated toward costumers and making costumes . It 's something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the R2 Builders , an Internet group devoted to designing and constructing replicas of R2-D2 . His R2 unit will be removed from storage and placed in the couple 's new living room this weekend . <p> One thing 's for certain : Their kids will never catch flak about their toys . <p> " I definitely need more Legos , so we need to have kids just so I can justify the toys , " Evan said . " I 'm not joking . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : February 19 , 2004 Thursday <p> CORRECTION : A photo in Saturday 's Gwinnett edition of Evan and Karen Reynolds , who had a science fiction-themed wedding , incorrectly described the costumes they were wearing . In the photo that ran on the front of the section , Evan was wearing a " Star Wars " storm trooper costume and Karen was dressed as " Star Wars " character Queen Amidala.
