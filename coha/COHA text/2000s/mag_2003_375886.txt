Is it the spectacular beaches ? The velvety wine ? The exchange rate ? Something compelling seems to lure fugitives from around the world to the South African city of Cape Town . Last week police in the seaside metropolis arrested American fugitives Craig Michael Pritchert , 40 , and Nova Ester Guthrie , 30 , wanted by the FBI for a series of bank heists staged across the American West in the mid-1990s . U.S. officials say Guthrie and Pritchert  --  a former college baseball star who turned to crime after he felt he had been eclipsed by his teammate and future big-league slugger Barry Bonds  --  spent much of the $500,000 they allegedly had stolen on day trading and traveling the world . The couple moved to Cape Town three years ago , where Guthrie got a job as a nightclub manager . <P> The latter-day Bonnie and Clyde are not the only fugitives to have turned up in Africa 's fun city . In 1999 Khalfan Khamis Mohamed , an al-Qaeda agent wanted for the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Tanzania , was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberation Army member James Kilgore , sought for his role in the 1975 murder of church worker Myrna Opsahl during a bank robbery in Carmichael , Calif. , was found last year teaching economics at the University of Cape Town . And German con man Jurgen Harksen , who had lived in the city since 1993 , was extradited to Germany last year , where he was convicted of fraud . Why do fugitives flock to this beautiful city ? " Perhaps they think we 're at the end of the world , " ventures a spokesman for the mayor . " Little do they know , we are far more First World than Third . Our international links are strong .
