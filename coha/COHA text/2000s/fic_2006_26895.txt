Chapter One Whitney My name is Whitney , and while it shames me to say it , I 'm a compulsive overeater . I do n't want to be , but that 's just what I 've been since I was a child and I ca n't seem to change it . Of course , I 've tried changing my eating habits a great number of times , specifically over the last fifteen years , but none of my yo-yo dieting has ever worked  --  at least not for long . And believe me when I say that I 've tried the very best of them , one right after another . Jenny Craig , Ornish , The Zone , Fit for Life , Slim-Fast , Herbalife , Atkins , and every other low-carb , no-carb , low-calorie weight-reduction fad on the planet . I 've even gone as far as starving myself completely , which was actually working until that night I passed out in the middle of aerobics class . Good God , I must have been entirely out of my mind . But insanity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred pounds heavier than they should be  --  women like me who spend every waking moment planning their next delicious meal and then promising themselves that they really will restart their diet this coming Monday . Sure , there are many overweight women who love themselves just the way they are and who walk around proudly with their heads held high , but most of us are not happy with the way we look . More importantly , we are not happy with the way we feel or the way some of us tend to be treated . Like the other day , when I was sitting at the mall in the food court section wolfing down a colossal meal from Taco Bell , and the couple sitting a few feet away looked over at me in disgust . They never said a word , but I knew immediately what they were thinking . They were wondering why I had the nerve to be eating anything at all , let alone two large burritos , a salad , and a large drink . I could read their minds as clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their understanding , I never looked in their direction again . Instead , I pretended that they did n't even exist . But actually , this was a huge part of my problem . I 've always searched for acceptance from others and I have my " wonderfully loving " mother to thank for it . From the time I was eight , she was already criticizing the way I looked , the way I walked , the way I did anything . Nothing was ever good enough . She demanded perfection , but I never gave it to her . Tina , my younger sister , on the other hand , did whatever it took to make Mother happy , and Mother has always loved her more because of it . Mother had even slipped and told me so a few years back during an argument we were having , but now she denies ever saying it . Still , I know what I heard and it is the reason our relationship has been terribly strained ever since . I drove my SUV onto I-94 West and immediately came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , and I could n't help wondering why I did this every day . Obviously , I needed to work for a living , but why I drove all the way to downtown Chicago from Covington Park , the south suburb where I lived , did n't make much sense . Not when I could have easily taken the Metra train round-trip . But to be frank , I just did n't feel comfortable doing it . The Metra was nice enough , but for some reason I 'd always had this weird phobia about traveling on anything relating to the rail system . Of course , no one understood it , but it was just who I was . I continued on my journey and realized I was barely a few miles from the exit that would take me to my favorite Krispy Kreme location . Each day I fought tooth and nail trying hard not to go there , and sometimes I actually did n't . Sometimes I drove past the exit and even felt good about it , but it was always a major struggle . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start up again . When I did , my phone rang . I rolled my eyes toward the ceiling when I saw that it was my sister . " Hello ? " I said . " Where are you ? " " In traffic , on my way to work . What 's up with you ? " " Why on earth do you keep doing that ? " she said , ignoring my question . " Doing what , Tina ? " " Driving all the way downtown . " " I do it because this is a free country and because I want to . " " Whatever . " " Whatever is right . Now , did you want something in particular or were you just calling to harass me ? " " I 'm calling for two reasons . Well , actually , three . First , I wanted to tell you that I got promoted yesterday to purchasing manager . " " Well , good for you . I know you 've been wanting that to happen . " " I have , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Then , on top of that , Riley Jackson asked me out . You know , that fine-as-wine anchorman on Channel Eight . " " That 's nice . " " Nice ? It 's fabulous . He 's a huge local celebrity and that means I 'll be going to the best parties that Chicago has to offer . " I could n't believe how shallow Tina was . She was so , so my mother and every bit as appalling . " What 's the third thing you wanted to tell me ? " I hurried to say because I did n't want to hear any more of my sister 's bragging . " That I 'm planning a surprise birthday party for Mother . " " Oh really ? When ? " " Duh . On her birthday . " " I know , Tina . But on her birthday , near her birthday , when ? " " Her birthday falls on a Saturday this year , so that 's when I 'd like to do it . " " Actually , my twenty-year high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay much attention to the date . I 'll have to make sure it 's not the same day . " Continues ...
