THE LUNAR LANDER descended onto the dusty pad , the fading blue crescent on its side - the Blue Moon Resort 's logo - lost in the rising dust . As the lander touched the pad , it yawed unsteadily before bumping gently back down . <p> Please , I prayed , no glitches . I looked at my watch : the media conference was scheduled to begin in two hours . <p> Finally the lunar dust , the regolith , settled in low-gray slo-mo and the small Menelaus Crater that defined the equatorial end of the Sea of Serenity reemerged behind the pad , bright with sunlight , crisp with detail . That was my personal signal that I could safely proceed . I licked my lips and pushed the unfamiliar joystick to propel the transfer vehicle Stewart had assigned me for the event , a kind of pressurized minivan , into a docking with the lander . By docking , we bring our guests to the resort without the hassle of an EVA . <p> The treads of the transfer vehicle crunched satisfyingly over the regolith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage at a meter 's distance , I checked my softscreen one last time . To my dismay , Karl Pope , the Chief Editor of Condo Nast Spacetravel , the man I 'd come to pick up , was now listed as " scrubbed . " I hurriedly called up the new data . <p> They 'd sent his assistant , a woman named Claire Albricht . <p> Netsearch flashed a list of projects she 'd been involved in - for Linux/Hilton , for The Aston Mazda Group . She was apparently a marketing whiz , but it was Karl Pope himself , one of the travel media 's heavy hitters , we 'd been counting on to give credibility to our press conference . <p> His loss was another blow . If our new marketing campaign could n't raise our occupancy rate , Blue Moon would have to close . I pictured myself being fitted for one of those yellow helmets they wore at the mining camp , breathing dusty air , shoveling ore to be fired for Helium 3 . <p> I peered out across the landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above the rocky plain that formed the Sea of Serenity , Earth hung in the black sky like a milk-swirled pearl , immense and bright . Yet it was the sight of Mare Serenitatis itself , its vast rolling face cupped by bright far cliffs , that brought me peace , that settled and centered me . <p> Then a wild mass of strawberry blonde hair pushed through the docking membrane . She was in her mid-thirties , a bit shaky . My heart skipped a beat - Claire Albricht 's bleary green eyes had a wounded quality , and her expression was unhappy , but none of that , not even her baggy radiation suit or her black lipstick , could hide the fact that she was an attractive woman . <p> " Welcome to Hyatt Regency Fiat Blue Moon , " I said , helping her stow her spacecase . " I 'm Charley Shackleton . Hyatt PR . Call me Shack . " <p> " Claire Albricht . Ough , 11 she grunted , grabbing the armrest with one pale hand , bracing the other against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " I reassured her . " There 's gravity here . " <p> " That was worse than flying to Australia . " <p> " You 'll feel better , " I said . " Give it a day . " <p> She glared out the big side window as I started up the transfer vehicle . " Where 's the resort ? " Claire Albricht asked . <p> She could keep the lipstick - too New York - but I liked her silver earrings , her long neck . " Ninety percent of the resort 's below the surface , " I explained , telling her something most guests know before they get here . " Protects everybody from impacts and temperature extremes - nights here get down to 240 below . " <p> She closed her eyes . " What do you mean , impacts ? " <p> I wondered if she 'd even glanced at her information packet . " Without an atmosphere to bum it up , " I said , " space debris comes right in . " I waved ahead at the pocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us our , um , moonscape . " <p> " There 's nothing here but rocks , " she said flatly . " Nothing at all . " <p> I bit my tongue . As we rounded the foot of the Menelaus Crater , the near folded cliffs of the Montes Haemus Range rose to form the equatorial border of the Sea . With Earth high behind us now , the shadowed curtains of rock were crowned by a sky brilliant with stars , all the colors of the rainbow shot through with white . " How about that ? " I asked . <p> She frowned at the cliffs and blinked . " This has got to be the most desolate place I 've ever seen . " <p> " Well , there 's lots to do , " I said , feeling my jaw go tight . " Ice skating , swimming , golf . Three restaurants , a spa . We 've got everything an Earthside resort 's got . " <p> The big dome sheltering our lobby swung into view , marked with the Blue Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treaded golf cart toward the course inside the crater , a sign of life which only seemed to call attention to the twenty empty carts at the starter 's pod . It was hard to hide our problem . <p> " I 've been trying to imagine what would make it worthwhile for Hyatt to fly us all up . I mean , in these days of virtuality , a press conference ? " <p> I docked at the canopied port without comment and let the valets take over . Truth to tell , it was United 's extra-orbital division that was eating the expense of flying up the media . The new promotion was a last ditch effort to keep business going for them , too . <p> Once inside , as the desk clerk took a retinal scan for room entry , I noticed how red-rimmed her eyes were , how watery . Wads of Kleenex stuck out of her pockets . As much as she annoyed me , I felt a wave of pity and restrained my impulse to book her next to the rattling ice machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Waterfall of Diana in the lobby , the one you walk behind on the way to the Atrium . " You 'd never guess this was even possible , " she said above its soft thunder as we passed into the big atrium . " And there 's so much light . " <p> There was vegetation too , and I directed her to a meandering path among leggy ferns and palms . " All thanks to our fusion plant up at the pole - we 've got a great supply of Helium 3 . " <p> She extracted a wad of Kleenex the size of a baseball from a pocket and buried her nose in it . " This is such an awful day for me , " she sniffled . I stood there , waiting for her to say something else , but she just kept blowing her nose , and so I took her by the elbow and led her toward her room , telling her about our flock of pigeons . <p> At the brass-doored elevators down I looked over and she was glaring at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation at two , " I said brightly . " I 'll bet you ca n't wait to get online and tell the world when you hear what this is about . " <p> BARRY STEWART - Blue Moon Resort 's General Manager - adjusted his blazer and glowered nervously , sweat beading just below his hairline . We had refitted our unused Copernicus Ballroom as a media center , complete with VR cameras for Earthside realtime holocast , full wall screens on three sides , net guides and browser pages windowed in . A full screen hi-D/3D moonmap hovered behind the dais , the resort keyed in with bright colors . The techs had done a wonderful job . <p> The media reps we 'd shuttled up were augmented by an equal number of our own employees to flesh out the crowd . Still , it was a disappointing sight : interns instead of editors ( from Orbit/ExtraGeo ) , location scouts instead of producers from The Virtual Travel Channel ) , small crews instead of live feeds ( from Extreme Outside and Space ) , out fitness instructor instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to keep Stewart from taking another hit from the silver flask he 'd started carrying . <p> " Barry , " I said , " we 're going to change history . Tell them that . " <p> " This better goddamned work , " he muttered . <p> Claire Albricht walked unsteadily into the room , creases in her jumpsuit , wild strands rising from her blonde hair . I sat her beside a giggling couple whom I introduced as prizewinners from OsakaHoneyMoon and she bared her teeth . <p> As usual , when the crunch came , Stewart was great . He paced back and forth on the little stage , first warming up the audience with stories from the Apollo landings , a holographic full moon radiant behind him . He told us of the resort 's conception and heyday , how in the ten years it had been in operation we employees had developed a special relationship with " this dear old rock . " Over the past few years , he explained , like a kindly uncle relating how a family had drifted apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon and the amazingly engineered resort and spa through which it can be experienced . " Nowadays the traffic goes to the orbiting hotels , right ? Sheraton Geosync , Caesar 's Sky Palace , Satellite 6 ? Well , I 'm here to tell you it 's time to think moon again . " <p> He took a deep breath and said , " I 've had a vision . " <p> According to Stewart - and this was the first time I 'd heard this version of the story - he 'd been out on an extended EVA surveying the Apollo 11 site for a potential hotel excursion . Out there alone , he 'd found himself thinking about the moon not just as a compelling landscape but as a presence , a spirit , though a spirit that lacked a face , some way to evoke it . He 'd wanted to speak to it , he said , but there was no name to call it by . <p> It was a testament to his charm that a hush fell over the sixty cynical media people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason we 've brought you here today . In cooperation with United Space , Hyatt Regency Fiat Blue Moon is proud to announce a marketing campaign that will change the way humans will see the heavens - the way lovers and sailors and astronauts and astronomers will see the night sky - until the end of time . " <p> Now he really had everyone 's attention . <p> " Out there at Apollo Site , I realized that , unlike every other body in the solar system-unlike every planet , unlike their moons , Titan , Phobos and Io , say - or even unlike asteroids Chiron , Hermes and Neseus Earth 's moon - now listen carefully - Earth 's moon does not have a name . 11 <p> " Let me repeat : the only completely natural satellite of Earth has no proper , formal name . " He let the information sink in - it was one of those obvious arrangements that went unnoticed . " All through history , we have n't been using a ' name , ' we 've been using a ' term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Stewart made the word sound cowlike , repulsive - " to signify a very unique place . " <p> " It 's time to correct this oversight . With the full compliance and authority of the International Astronomical Union , the official naming body for asteroids , comets and stars , Hyatt Regency Fiat has secured rights in perpetuity to a proper name for Earth 's moon . " Stewart smiled . " I see from the dataprompters that our audience is building Earthside , " he observed . <p> The girl from The Space Channel , a chubby brunette with a battered headset , was scurrying around to check her live feed , all around the Copernicus Room equipment was being touched and tweaked . <p> " Of course , the choice of a name for the moon belongs to the human race as a whole . And so - listen carefully again  --  we 've created a contest with a few simple rules . From the moment I initialize our dedicated netsite , NAmE THAT MooN , we will take nominations and votes for a name for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one vote per Earth day . The voting will continue around the clock for seven days . At the end of the week , the moon will have a new , official name . " <p> Contest regs scrolled behind him as Stewart raised his right arm . " Please join us , citizens of Earth , as we NAME THAT MOON ! " <p> When his arm came down the new Netsite washed over all the screens and the crowd in the Copernicus Room flitted around like carp at feeding time . Correspondents shouted questions , bumped one another , waved their arms to be recognized , shouldered their way to the center aisle . The Osaka couple stood on their chairs . It must have been too much for Claire Albricht , whom I saw with her head in her hands . <p> Candace Yuen , from our marketing department , joined Stewart , describing how random voters would be chosen to win trips , mylar excursion suits , even have their names assigned to darkside craters . Above the din she started touting VR tours of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the dais a list of names started to grow : Artemis , Hoku , Luna , New America .... In the tally window , numbers were already starting to rise like the bounce from the audience . An excited crowd in low grav is distinctive : gestures are more expansive , heads bob , people move more . Stewart was taking questions , Candace was laughing , and zeroed in on the tall Chinese editor from HyperWire , who 'd promised a week-long feature in realtime holo in exchange for the golf pass I had in my pocket . <p> I saw Claire Albricht again on my way out . She was alone against the back wall , looking dazed , her wad of Kleenex in her fist . Her lipstick was faded . <p> " What do you think ? " I asked , sitting beside her , trying to be friendly . <p> She looked at me sideways . " This is a really bizarre idea . Who does Hyatt Fiat think it is ? All the names here are so ancient . Greek . Roman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed her , " farside names are modern  --  craters named Oppenheimer and Fermi , the Sea of Moscow . " <p> " Well , it 's still pretty amazing . " She shook her head . " When 's my flight back ? ' <p> " What ? " <p> " I 'm ready to leave . When 's my flight back ? " <p> I exhaled through my teeth . " The deal with Conde Nast is , you 're supposed to be putting together a story based on live reports . A week 's worth . You 're up here for the duration . Did n't you even know that ? " <p> A dark look crossed her face . The largest wad of Kleenex I 'd ever seen came out of her pocket and floated to her eyes like one of the plump misty cumulus that condense up in the dome . <p> This time my sympathy ran out . " You do n't know the first thing about us , " I told her . " You do n't know why you 're here . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Could n't Condo Nast have spared someone who was at least remotely interested ? " <p> The damp wad floated down and her eyes welled with tears . I heard a small voice . <p> " What ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said . <p> She buried her head in her hands and sobbed . Then she composed herself and looked at me bleary-eyed . " I s .. said , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I 'm taking it out on you . I 've been having such an awful time . I broke up with .... Oh , you do n't know him . He and I , Karl and I .... " <p> " Karl ? " <p> " Three days ago , we 're at Kennedy . He 's booked to come here , I 'm booked to go to Maui . I told him - and it 's really hard to tell somebody it 's over , you 're supposed to do it in a public place , right ? And he did n't get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him my rehearsed speech , and he does n't understand . It gets so bad I go , ' Do n't you get it ? You 're dumped . What part of " I 'm moving out of the condo " do n't you get ? ' and the next thing I know .... " <p> " Karl Pope ? From Conde Nast ? " <p> She sniffed , nodded . " I should n't have used the word dumped/ right ? The next thing I know he takes my ticket to Maui and he gives me his to here and he goes , ' Good-bye , you bimbo . ' He called me a bimbo . I knew I never should have dated my boss . " She was burbling . " I feel so awful . " <p> I sighed . " Well , Claire , listen . How about keeping us out of your plans for revenge . We 're just trying to survive here . Maybe you 've noticed ? " <p> She sniffled . " That 's a fact . You hardly have any real guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a travel writer . " <p> " Well , I do know about marketing , " she said . " That 's what I 'm saying . You could be doing better . " <p> " Is that right ? Tell me about it . " <p> " Would you be a little less pissed ? " <p> " I could try . " <p> She took a breath , blinked to clear her eyes . " Okay . To begin with , you do n't use your hotel manager to announce a campaign . That 's so minor league . If you want real publicity , you get a celebrity . You get somebody who brings an audience with them . " <p> " Like who ? " <p> " Like , I do n't know . Shirley Taylor . Lance Jason . Art Ball . Art Ball would have been perfect . " <p> " Art Ball ? " I snorted . " The talk show host ? The one who 's part Artificial Intelligence ? " I pretended disbelief , but the truth was I listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Candace , but after the look she 'd given me I 'd been too embarrassed to take the idea further . " Art Ball 's over a hundred and fifty years old . The human parts of him , anyway . " <p> " He 's got the largest single listening audience on Earth . Tops two billion . " She sniffled . " Oh , Earth . I miss Earth . " <p> " There 's nothing I can do to fly you back , " I said . " But , look , you could have a good time while you 're here if you 'd give it a chance . We 've got a pool , bars , a gym . Golf . " <p> " My therapist did tell me to start something new , to get some exercise . " <p> " There 's a schedule downloaded to your softscreen . Banquet tonight . Moon range chicken . " <p> She sniffled into the Kleenex . " I do n't think I feel like eating . " <p> " How about tomorrow ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked my softscreen ; I was booked for lunch with two Italian PR men . " I 'll be free at two ? " <p> " Ough , " she said , sniffling . " Ough-kay . " <p> That night at midnight I sat on my bunk picking stringy chicken from my teeth , feeling sorry for myself - since Samantha 'd left a year ago , my quarters just seemed empty . I was listening to web radio from Earthside , watching my autodialer strobe on my softscreen . To my surprise the faint flashing stopped , the speakerphone booted up , and a nasal voice said , " Hello ? " A hot flash of self-consciousness shot through my body . I cleared my throat . <p> " Uh , hello . Art ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Art Ball ? " <p> " Well , who 'd you expect ? " the familiar voice of Art Ball groused over the speakerphone . " We do n't have screeners here , like some other shows . " <p> " First-time caller , long-time listener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got through . Great show , Art . " <p> " I 'm getting a delay . Are you up on one of the satellites ? At Lil " <p> " Calling from the moon , Art . This is Shack .... " <p> " WELL , TURN YOUR RADIO DOWN , SHACK , " Art Ball started bellowing . " BETTER YET , TURN IT OFF . HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU LISTENERS TO TURN YOUR RADIOS OFF WHEN YOU GET IN ? " <p> I fumbled with my keypad to cut the speaker , my hand shaking . " Art ? Still there ? " <p> " That 's better . What 's on your mind ? " <p> " Art , I know you 're interested in the great adventure of space .... " <p> " And what 's your point ? " <p> " I 'm just saying , have you heard about that webvote , Net THAT MOON ? " <p> " Right . " <p> " Art , it would be great to see the good people who are behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Caller , are you one of our Helium 3 miners ? " <p> " Uh , no . " <p> A long silence filled my quarters . " Let me guess , " Ball 's voice snaked out like a slo-mo whip . " You 're an employee of Hyatt Fiat . You know how we feel about the New Solar Order down here ? " <p> " The what ? " I vaguely recalled an old U.N . proposal that claimed sovereignty over the moon , to which Hyatt had signed off . Some glitch in Ball 's Al software must have locked onto the Hyatt reference and his opposition to it . " Art , " I said emphatically , " This is not a political thing .... " <p> " You people think you can use my airtime for propaganda ? Listen to this , Shack . " <p> The signal went dead with a thunk . My face flushed , and my eyes burned . My speakerphone hissed with the vastness of space . <p> I gave Claire Albricht the tour , starting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapture of average skaters working out their first triple axels in one-sixth gravity . A couple from Minnesota took turns launching 360 overflights at center ice . <p> After a night 's sleep Claire looked refreshed , looked better than she deserved to look . Her lipstick today was dark plum , an improvement . She told me she was n't much of an athlete . <p> " It 's different here , " I told her . " Low gravity . " <p> My point was demonstrated when , on the way to showing her our diving boards - diving is like flying here - we cut through a workout room with thick pads on ' its floor and filled with gymnastics equipment - parallel bars , rings , a pommel horse . <p> She grimaced . " Here 's my torture chamber from high school . " <p> " Try something . " <p> " Aw .... " <p> " Just one thing . " <p> She took one low gray step toward a pommel horse without much enthusiasm . And , astonished , she found herself sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that was .. amazing . " <p> She bounced down and tried it again . <p> Next she tried the parallel bars - slipped off , did n't hurt herself , bounced back up again . She was smiling like a kid . " I could never do anything like this on Earth . " <p> We looked over the spa , the whirlpool , the climbing wall , the weight room , but we came back to the gymnastics equipment . <p> " Can I use this gym ? " <p> " Right now , if you want to . The concierge will give you a locker , bring you the right clothes . " <p> " Thanks , " she said . " You 're pretty nice after all . Can I get a rain check on your invitation ? " <p> I thought of the Hubble Room , pricey even with the employee discount - though if the hotel was going to close in a week , it might be my last chance to eat there . " Lunch tomorrow , " I said , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LATER I CHECKED in with Barry Stewart at the Copernicus Room . He was alone , though a quartet of remote VR cameras servoed back and forth from stations along the side walls and made it seem like we were being watched . That turned out to be wishful thinking . <p> " How 'd our first day turn out ? " I asked . Out of superstition , actually dread , I 'd avoided looking at the website . <p> " Could be better , " he mumbled . He was chewing his thumb . <p> I finally looked . " A hundred and sixty thousand votes total from Earthside ? " <p> His expression was pained . " Actual hits less than projections , " he said . " That number 's a bit inflated . " <p> I 'd gotten close enough to where he sat hunched over a terminal to smell alcohol on his breath . He was wearing the same blazer he 'd worn the previous night at the banquet - you could tell from the faux Bernaise sauce on his lapel . " It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , who 's ahead ? " I read from the wallscreen . " Diana . In second place , there 's Artemis . All the old space junkies liked that name back in the last century , still do , I guess . I do n't find an entry listed in third place . " <p> " I 'm , uh , leaving it off the official results . You know how we assign each voter a password to make sure they vote only once a day ? Apparently the line about enter password ' is confusing . " <p> " Oh , Christ , " I said . " You mean third place is ' password ' ? " <p> He worked on his thumb . " A quarter of the votes . " <p> " Cripes . The moon could be named ' Password . ' " I looked over his shoulder and saw a long list of what I took to be Native American names following " password " on his softscreen . " Some nice ideas , " I said . <p> " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> A knot of Helium 3 miners crowded the stainless steel bar Claire and I passed through on our way to the Hubble Room the next day . Even dressed in clean red jumpsuits , the miners , men and women both , looked grubby , skinny from long-time low grav work , squinty-eyed from living in low light . <p> I steered Claire past . After a day working out in the spa and pool she looked vibrant and healthy , looked great , which did n't escape one of the male miners , who clowned falling off his barstool . <p> " I still do n't get it , " Claire was saying . " What 's wrong with the word ' moon ' ? " <p> " It 's not a name , " I told her , pulling her chair back . The Rubble Room overlooked the southern end of the pool , just above the waterfall up in the atrium , just below the level at which clouds formed late in the lunar cycle . It was our grandest spot . " The word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word month/ which itself comes from the IndoEuropean word for measure . A ' moon ' is a device to measure time in the sky . It 's not a proper name . " <p> " Luna , then . The ancient name is Luna . " She waved vaguely at our false sky , the inside of the dome , painted with fanciful stars and our blue crescent logo . <p> " A second rank Roman goddess . I looked her up . Not a single legend to her credit . And the name 's never stuck . You say to somebody in Manhattan , let 's go to Luna , they think you mean some town in upstate New York . " <p> " Artemis ? " <p> " Another name that sounds like a town upstate , but otherwise an excellent candidate . Artemis was Apollo 's sister . Moon , sun . Still second in the voting . " <p> " According to my sources , your contract with the Astronomical Union 's airtight , so I guess it 's going to be your call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon Pie . Cute . " <p> I noticed her nose was still a bit red . <p> " And what are you going to do if the hotel closes ? " she asked . <p> " It 's hard for me to imagine leaving , " I told her . <p> She rolled her eyes . " Believe it or not , I 'm just having salad . I 'm signed up for back to back aerobics classes . " <p> Claire skipped the evening 's banquet . I drank too much at the United party afterwards and wound up stopping at the Copernicus Room around midnight . Candace was there with a triple Cappuccino . Stewart 's tie was askew , his voice hollow . I could smell something different on his breath - he 'd switched to Southern Comfort , a bad sign . <p> " Look at this ... , " he muttered . " How can the Lakota sue us over the name Hatara ? We ca n't be ' appropriating ' that name . I made it up . " <p> " They made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the other traffic . " What 's this ' Moonbeam Laser ' product ? ' I I asked . " Can they really sue us ? " <p> " Check out the message from ' Wicken.org , ' " Candace said . " When the lawyers have some free time , they should look into the legality of this curse . " <p> " It 's awful , " Stewart said . " Even bookings are down . What did we do wrong ? " <p> I shrugged , staring dully at the holo moon on the front wall , cycling through its phases . <p> " Shack ? " <p> " The only plausible explanation I 've heard so far is that we need a celebrity spokesman . " <p> " Like who ? " he snorted . " Art Ball ? " <p> " Well , " I said as brightly as I could , " I think I heard somebody mention his name . " <p> Candace laughed so hard she shot Cappuccino out her nose . <p> Claire Albricht had turned into a low-grav exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps " in aerobics classes , and on the gymnastics equipment , swam for countless laps , even started diving from the ten meter board . I stopped by to watch her - by her invitation - as I took breaks from full buffet breakfasts , media briefings , cocktail parties , ten  --  course banquets . <p> She was fun to watch . Moonies are skinny . She had some flesh . <p> On day four she invited me to lunch at the juice bar next to the spa . <p> " I hope I 'm not being a pest , " I said . " Everybody else is lizarding out in the Jacuzzis , pigging out in the banquets . " <p> " I used to do that , " she said . " Now I feel like a new person . Karl is so history .

She still had a little red around her nose , but otherwise looked great , her skin smooth and fresh , her eyes clear and bright . <p> My eyes , on the other hand , felt like they had sand in them .

When I get back to New York I 'm going to set up a consulting firm in resort marketing . You 're a sharp guy . That kind of job would work for you . Relocate and I 'll hire you . " <p> " Like I say , I ca n't imagine living anywhere else . " <p> " What do you see in bare rocks ? " <p> " You have n't gone outside yet , have you ? " <p> " Hands full right here , thanks . Get in shape before I go back , be ready for it . " She actually rubbed her hands together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could see the rosin embedded in her palms . She smiled at me . " Though I could take a break . " <p> My heart skipped a beat . " There 's a trip I have to take tomorrow , " I told her . " A long ride out in the transfer van to the Armstrong Site . How about coming along ? <p> That night , late , I lay on my bunk listening to Web audio again , that great throwback . Of course we run on a different " day " up here , with our light/dark cycle adjusted to Earth 's , so my atrium window was a soft blanket of darkness . <p> " Thanks for taking my call , Art , " I heard a male voice say , a voice heavy with a tired slur , a familiar voice . The hair rose on the back of my neck and I sat up . " First-time caller , long-time listener , Art , " the voice said . <p> I heard the clink of a silver flask . I could almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call was brief , even by Art Ball standards . " We have a voiceprint on you , General Manager Stewart , " Art Ball snarled . " We 're not taking calls from you New Solar Order people . " <p> You could hear Barry starting to protest as he was cut off , but only half his word came out , and his " Arrrr .... " made him sound like a dog . <p> " Wild card line , east of the Urals , you 're on the air , " Art said to someone else . " Can you imagine that guy ? " <p> " A road ? " Claire said . " A road on the moon ? " <p> " A track , " I corrected her . " Nobody 's allowed to build a road on the moon . This is n't something you can see from Earth . We run semi-inflated treads and make a hundred kilometers per hour without leaving much impact - the embedded track guides us around boulders , crevasses , collapsed lava tubes . " <p> She moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with the folding chairs and tables , the crates of bunting , the box of collector quality flags , the EVA suits , the spare life support stuff , the tools . My assignment was to scout a media event at Tranquility Base - Stewart was considering pulling out all the stops - and the rear of the transfer van was stuffed with equipment we 'd want down there . <p> Claire leaned against the thick lexan window , trying to get a better view . " It 's so different when you 're not spacesick , " she mused . " So clear . It 's like my eyesight 's better . " <p> " No atmosphere , " I reminded her . <p> In my mirror Blue Moon 's main dome was receding rapidly . Ahead lay boulders and craters sprinkled across the regolith stretching away to the horizon , a horizon on which you could see the very shape of the moon 's curvature . <p> " Amazing , " Claire agreed . <p> I accelerated and toggled in the object radar to avoid any unpleasant surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said quietly . <p> THE RUN TO the ' 69 landing site , Tranquility Base , takes you east along the shore of the Sea of Serenity to a break in its high bordering ridge near the Plinius Crater . From there what we now called Armstrong Site is a straight drive south across the center of the other major lowland in this quadrant of the moon , the Mare Tranquillitatis . To reach the site , you traverse the Sea of Tranquility until you reach a long feature called the Rima Hypotia , just north of the lunar equator , and then you turn east . <p> Along the way , especially near Plinius , you encounter ridging , massive rimes and collapsed lava tubes , but those aside , you also see wonderful flat patches across the regolith . You see every kind of landscape the moon offers . <p> We had a long talk , Claire and 1 , as we drove . I recalled how when I was a kid , my dad had told me about watching the first moon landing when he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the original landing site I 'd felt connected to him in a way that had surprised me , connected with some dream of his in that Detroit suburb in whose back yard he watched the heavens . Maybe I was overdoing it , but even now , I told Claire , Tranquility Base seemed to me a sacred spot , a spiritual place , not unlike Machu Picchu . " Or Haleakala , that enormous high caldera in Hawaii . " <p> " That 's where I 've seen this landscape before , " she mused . " It 's like being around the Hawaii volcanoes . " <p> " Only up here it goes on forever . That 's what I like about the lunar surface , " I told her . " It 's raw planet , as primitive as it gets . " <p> " You do n't want to see it become terraformed ? " <p> " Not me . I like it just the way it is . Full of promise . Old and tough and full of promise . " <p> She saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar lander that had been installed at the site . " There it is , " she said . <p> Sure enough , in the middle distance the spidery legs and drum-shaped body glinted in the sunlight . We closed in quickly . <p> " There 's the American flag , " Claire said when she spotted the little Old Glory left by Armstrong , with its horizontal batten to make it wave . I started telling her how it had been knocked flat when the Apollo crew had taken off , and how NASA had reconstructed the site , when she wondered out loud about debris around the lander . I thought at first she was seeing the scientific instruments the crew had left behind , the ESAP equipment , the passive seismometer . <p> Then I noticed the crude writing on the lander 's side . <p> The childish yellow letters read , NOTHING COULD BE FINER THAN TO MAKE IT WITH A MINER . <p> I brought the van to a stop , rubbed my eyes , and sighed . " I do n't suppose I should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter 's pod on the golf course last year with the same color paint . " <p> Ration wrappers and beer tubes littered the site near a burst waste cylinder . The white bunting hanging from the ladder turned out to be toilet paper . " They 've trashed the whole site . " To my great dismay I saw dozens of fresh bootprints stomped at the foot of the lander 's ladder . <p> " So rude , " Claire said . " Those people from the bar ? " <p> " Two years ago they put laundry soap in the Falls of Diana . " <p> " So adolescent . That tag is obscene . " <p> I unbuckled my harness and moved some cartons to fish out the toolbox and service supplies . After rooting around I turned up with a can of hydraulic fluid in the emergency kit . Then I started struggling into my EVA suit . <p> " Where are you going ? " <p> " I think this 'll get the paint off , " I told her , waving the can . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can and clean up out there . But hey , " I added when I saw her pulling on the baggy leggings , " not you . " <p> " I would n't miss this for the world . " <p> Once on the surface , Claire bounced around in her silver EVA suit like a kid at soccer practice . " Look at Earth , " she blurted when she caught her breath . " So bright and blue and white . Walking around out here , it 's like heaven , like I 'm in heaven . " <p> As for me , I felt like hell until I saw how well the hydraulic fluid dissolved the yellow paint from the metal shell of the replica lunar lander . I used the bunting I 'd brought along to rub it clean . It took a while . Eventually I improvised a rake out of the LEM ladder and started to systematically wipe miner footprints from the regolith near the lander . Claire walked ahead , picking up litter , stowing it , detrashing the site . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there somewhere , but I had no choice except to obliterate it along with the miners ' . When Claire finished her sweep of the site , she came around behind me and scattered handfuls of regolith to obscure the little furrows from my rake . It sounds easy enough , but out there in the clumsy suits , it was slow going . <p> Two and a half hours later , Tranquility Base looked like a museum exhibit again , except for the missing Armstrong footprint . <p> As it was perhaps the most famous single footprint in human history , we needed to replace it somehow . First we downloaded archival images from NASA 's website and studied them carefully . My plan was to step gingerly on the passive seismometer so as not to leave tracks , then to bounce up the ladder and position myself as Armstrong had . From there it would be a simple matter of a hard step down from the bottom rung . <p> " Wait , " Claire said . <p> " Make it quick , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve life support . " <p> " What 's your boot size ? " <p> " Eleven 2E . Does it matter ? " <p> " According to NASA archives , Armstrong had small feet . His boot size was nine and a half . Narrow . " <p> " Where the hell are we going to such small feet ? " <p> She pointed down to her boots . " Nine and half . Narrow . " <p> So we traded places . " One small step for Claire , " she said just before she jumped . " One large step for all Clairekind . " <p> Because we 'd lost so much time cleaning up the site , I radioed in a negative report on the scouting trip and we had to drive straight back . Still , the drive was breathtaking , the sun high and slow across the sky , the Earth slipping to our left and then setting . We were both a little giddy at what we 'd done . <p> From the moment we docked at the main dome , you could sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than twenty-four hours remained until the contest 's conclusion . More Hyatt people had come up to join the partygoing journalists and hotel guests in a kind of last day 's frenzy of food and wine and excess . <p> The big table on the dais in the Copernicus Room was askew , crowded with half-empty glasses of wine , coffee cups and abandoned room service plates littered with stale food . I found Stewart stretched across three chairs in the comer , drunk and sullen . Candace , who had been conducting virtual press conferences Earthside since early morning , was desperate , her voice hoarse . I took over for her , worked for eight hours straight , fielding questions and calls , infusing false cheer into our dismal numbers , pretending surprise and pride that " Luna , " ahead all week , looked like it was going to finish first . <p> Claire and I became separated once I started to work , but then she really disappeared , into the gym , I supposed , or to take a nap after our excursion . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect with her , and I frankly was relieved that she was n't there for the humiliation of the final night 's banquet - half the chairs empty , Stewart incoherent and helped to his room . During the gazpacho I was passed a note from Claire telling me she 'd gone out on another EVA , entirely on her own , a walk around the dome to collect some rocks to take home , that she would find me later . <p> But when I looked for her at midnight , she was nowhere to be found . I dragged myself off to my room , fatigued beyond belief after the long day , and threw myself on my bunk . <p> I could n't sleep . An active solar flare sent a wave of broadband static across all the communications channels , and the web audio link I lay there listening to reminded me of radio in the old days , fading in and out , conversations washed by flurries of audio snow .... <p> " Loyal caller , long-time listener , Art , " a female voice said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice , eerily familiar . " Call me ' Heavenly Ten . ' I used to call you from Earth . Remember me ? You were so my hero . " <p> Art 's voice changed . " My god , I do remember you . Is that you , ' California Ten ' ? It 's been .. years . What can I do for you ? " <p> Art recognized it too , or at least the program of his Al did , some deeply enduring quality of that voice . I remembered hearing a voice like that while listening to Art Ball when I was a kid . Almost all of Art 's callers , then as now , were men , but once in a while you 'd hear that siren 's voice and the whole conversation changed , moved as if a step to the side . The voice seemed to speak directly to an old subroutine in the AI , to open a secret trap door : Ball had always had a weak spot for women who did call , not for the tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathy voices promised some unseen sybaritic redemption - as his audience had been mostly male , the old-fashioned attitudes had been part of his appeal . The trap door was apparently still programmed in the AI , and you could . hear him responding . <p> " I 'm so mad at you , Art , " the voice pouted . <p> " Oh my god , why ? " And you could hear it , the genuine nervousness in his voice , the uncertain edge that comes from loss of confidence . <p> " You betrayed all of us women who love you when you blew off that moon contest . If you 'd only supported it , think how many of us would be looking up there right now . And next week and the week after that . Gazing at the moon because it meant something . " I thought Candace ? then remembered her hoarse voice . Still , something familiar . " But that 's all right , " the voice went on . " I understand , Art , why a romantic idea like NAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too old to be romantic anymore . I 'll bet you never sit with Ramona outside your trailer in Parump looking at the moon on a beautiful night .... " <p> " Awwwoh , " Art moaned . " You know , Ten ? You might be right . It would have been romantic . " <p> " Might be ? " <p> " Ramona is going to be annoyed with me . " <p> " As she ought to be . You 're letting those liberals from the New Solar Order pick the name of the moon . " <p> Art moaned again . " What name do you suggest ? just tell me . I 'll log onto that website and vote myself . " <p> " What really matters is that your listeners call . " Now I heard something else in the voice , a kind of marketing savvy hiding behind the voice changing circuit . <p> A couple more sentences and I was sure . The voice belonged to Claire . <p> I looked at my watch . Two A.M. , twelve hours until the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the result , I decided . Still , I was touched down to my toes and smiled as I shut down all the circuits in my cubicle and settled back on my pillow . I told myself : Claire had tried to help , and it would all be over soon . <p> I OVERSLEPT . When I woke I took a long , hot shower , and slowly got dressed without logging in . On the final day of the contest , at the final hour , I went directly to the Copernicus Room to see the wreckage . <p> Barry Stewart , I was surprised to see , was on his feet , wearing a fresh suit and clean shaven . He was gesturing with animation to a larger knot of media people than I 'd seen all week . judging from equipment logos , new techs had also flown up . I recognized four network heavy hitters in the restricted area behind the dais , covering the story in holo presence . There was a special electricity in the room . A middle-aged guy with a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved back - he looked very familiar , but I could n't recall his name . Candace came striding by and I asked her who he was . <p> " That 's Karl Pope , you dummy , " she said in her hoarse voice , stopping , looking me in the eye , cocking her head . " Did n't you hear he 'd flown up from Maui ? " She smiled . " Though you of all people I should n't be calling dummy . I apologize . " <p> " For ... ? " <p> She rolled her eyes and shook her head , turning away from me with her arms raised , leaving me to stare at the wallscreen . The full moon cycled in the repeated time-lapse pattern that had been pixelled in all week , overlaid with our numbers . I blinked , rubbed my eyes in disbelief . <p> Overnight we 'd gone from eighty million hits on our netsite to three and a half billion Earthside voters . <p> And that 's how the moon came to be named Art Ball . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loony as Art Ball himself , and six months later , as I write this story , the moon 's new official name is still too improbable for most people to take seriously . But the attention the new name created nonetheless saved us . Our bookings immediately shot up six hundred percent and the reservations site clogged with traffic . As you probably know , we 're booked solid to the end of the decade and we 're planning to excavate a new wing . What with all the extra flights United 's put on , the United/Hyatt consortium 's already started work on another landing pad . <p> Yet for all its odd quality , you do hear the moon called Art Ball up here once in a while ( particularly among the miners ) , and you certainly do hear the name used more and more Earthside . Good-natured people look to the night sky and turn to one another with smiles and say , " Art Ball . " All over the world , I 'm told , kids have started pointing up and telling their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire and I sat through a movie just last night , a remake of Huck Finn set on a Mars mission , and midway back to Earth the Huck character turned to the Jim character and said , looking to Earth 's moon , " There he is . There 's Art Ball . " <p> When you live on the moon for a while , you adjust to its rhythms . After we celebrated the end of the contest , after Claire explained how she 'd used voiceprints from Art Ball 's archives to identify the AI 's weak spot , and after she got her chance to spurn Karl Pope one more time , most of the media people flew back to Earth . Claire stayed on and we watched Earth set earlier and earlier in the shadowy coming of the real end of a lunar day . <p> On our way back from Tranquility Base , Claire had promised to spend a night with me , and I talked her into a trip for the two of us over an entire lunar darkcycle , fourteen days . Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basin , near the moon 's south pole . We both took leaves and I drove the van down there . <p> At 1,350 miles in diameter and two miles deep , the Aitken Basin is one of the largest craters in the solar system . It 's a grand sight , all right , but that 's not why we went down there . <p> Inside the basin is a smaller crater , large enough by Earth standards , but tucked inside the basin with a group of two others . This crater is the Shackleton Crater ( yes , named after my great-great-grandfather , Ernest , of Antarctic fame ) . The spacehab module we drove to is parked at the point where the west rim of the Shackleton Crater intersects with the rims of the two other craters , forming a peak about 4,000 feet above the basin floor and canted at just the right angle to escape Earth 's shadow . Because the sun falls on this patch of ground day and night virtually year-round , the Dutch astronomer Ockels called this spot " the peak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate continuous power to the module , keeping it warm and cozy , the love nest of preference for a quarter million miles . EVA walks are spectacular . It 's as if you had the Grand Canyon , Haleakala Caldera , and Everest absolutely all to yourself . <p> After a couple of days , Claire found herself pointing out how small a dot New York made when you looked for it , squinted hard , tried to make out its lights at night . " Just a dot , " I remember her saying that day , curled on a sheepskin by the big Texan window . " From here New York is so just a dot . I ca n't tell you how much I 've gotten to like it here . This is the ultimate place to get away from it all . " <p> The day we 'd left Blue Moon I 'd turned down an unsolicited job offer , the best that had turned up so far , to be the head of PR for the Moorea Beach Hotel . When I could turn my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew my heart belonged on the moon . That Claire wanted to stay here as well meant my heart would be full . <p> She handled some of the rocks she 'd picked up earlier in the day , rocks for a collection she 'd started the day we 'd gone to Tranquility Base . She 'd noticed that not all the moon rocks were of a uniform charcoal cast . Seen up close , many had subtle hints of color in them , trace elements and their oxides , the building blocks of Earth , hints of ocher and umber and copper and gold , silver and white , deep reds and darker browns - all the colors of life hidden in the raw rock . <p> " Like Barry said , " I told her . " There 's a job for you up here if you want it . A life . " <p> " Count me in , " she said , snuggling close . <p> I buried my face in her soft hair . <p> A half hour later , as we sat looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you think Barry 'll want me to do ? " <p> " Marketing " I shrugged . " Work with Candace . " <p> She was looking at Earth through the big window . " Mmmm , Shack ? " Claire finally said . " You know , I 'm just thinking , well , for later ? Like I say , I 'm just thinking , and maybe you know ? " <p> " Know what , Claire ? " <p> " Technically speaking , is ' Earth ' a proper name ?
