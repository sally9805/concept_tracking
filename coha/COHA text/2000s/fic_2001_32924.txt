Chapter Preface Uptown on Park Avenue , Skip sat on the edge of his bed-antique Venetian , supported head and foot by gilded leaping dolphins . He was clad only in a polka dot silk dressing gown with velvet lapels . A loose strand of hair , bleached almost white by the summer sun on low-lying beaches , swept across his forehead . He was beautiful , with a sweet beatific aura , and his skin was very fair . The cheeks were soft and radiant . It was the kind of face that tricks went crazy over . Skip dangled his bare feet off the bed and opened his robe . A pale naked image with dreamy hyacinth-blue eyes looked out at him from the tall mirror , like the center panel of some Renaissance triptych . His chest and legs had a buttermilk sheen and shimmered in the hothouse light . He ran his hands down his thighs . He was restless and tired of being alone . If his sister had come home , they could 've gone out on the town . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his closet and fingered the light blue silk tulle , then a strapless pink satin with seed pearls . They were all his sister 's dresses , let out for him at the waist and the hem with a few tucks here and there . She was no prude . If her baby brother liked to dress up in her clothes and said he was gay , that was all right with her . She loved him and found his friends charming . They had lots of laughs . Of course , if his father found out , the old man would have a screaming hissy fit . And Mummie would really take to her bed for good with a whole thermos of hot toddies . Skip 's hand lingered over the metallic threads of a floor-length gold lam he 'd worn the night he won first prize at the Paradise Casino on 125th Street . It was a big drag to-do , almost as big as Phil Black 's Funmakers Ball . A long stairway with a shiny brass railing led up to the door where Skip had slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and champagne . After the competition , his friend Titanic , a drag queen who entertained at the Candy Box Club , had come by to congratulate him . " You look just like Dietrich , dahling , " Titanic said and swished a fan of real ostrich plumes in one gloved hand . " A natural beauty wonder ! " Titanic could be a sore loser , but he had n't allowed Skip to feel guilty about winning . Skip already felt self-conscious about being filthy rich , and Titanic had told him a thousand times how silly that was . " For Chrissake , I do n't know why you 're ashamed of all that moolah , " he 'd say . " If the fur coat fits , wear it . Poor is tacky ! " Clutching the gold lam , Skip thought maybe he 'd drive down to the Candy Box and say hello to Titanic and the other kids . He 'd go backstage and have a few laughs . It seemed like ages since he 'd been there . Titanic had told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar-a lot of creeps , all closet cases . " I ought a know , " he 'd grin . But Skip wanted to suck a dick . Maybe he would try to pick up somebody anyway . He carried only the money he needed , no identification , in case his trick turned out to be an undercover cop . Because his family was well-to-do , he could n't afford to be recognized . The picture of bandbox elegance , Skip stared again into the mirror , his eyes a haunting blue . He 'd dressed simply for his visit to the Candy Box , in a Savile Row suit and silk shirt from Sulka , with a foulard tie and pocket square . He shuffled down the balustraded stairway into the apartment 's circular polished-marble foyer , and pressed a button . A white-gloved attendant popped up in the small velvet and gilt cage of an elevator , like a diver emerging from the deep . He opened the door and rode Skip down to the building 's wide vaulted vestibule . Red damask covered its walls halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paintings in the beef-gravy colors of the Royal Academy represented English cathedrals and Italianate ruins . Beneath them sat pleasant groupings of low sofas , wing chairs covered in striped satin , and mahogany tables . Ruggles , the doorman , touched his cap . He was gap-toothed and elderly , liveried in gray to match the fortress-like , pre-World War I building . Thirteen floors of stone with sharp cornices , false architraves , and fluted pilasters . " Will they be bringing the car around , sir ? " Ruggles asked . He noted that the boy was wearing a proper suit and no makeup . Maybe someone had warned the father , or the sister , that people in the building were beginning to talk . " I 'll need a taxi , " Skip replied . They stood beneath a green awning that stretched to the sidewalk . Unquestioning , Ruggles stepped off the curb . His shrill whistle sounded up and down Park Avenue . Skip 's Checker cab bounced downtown . Red taillights bobbed on either side , taxis and limousines picking up fashionable people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , no one would sleep until dawn . Skip watched the city flash by and wished he 'd gotten into the chorus line at the Candy Box . " It must be wonderful to be in show business , " a stagestruck Skip had hinted to Titanic in the dressing room . " What could I call myself ? " " Oh , something aristocratic , " Titanic replied , " like Alexis , Georgette , Lalique . " " Howzabout Dolly Dimples ? " Blackie Cole had suggested and flashed him one of her sensational smiles . In her white tie and tails , she looked like a swashbuckling Errol Flynn , starring in the new show at the club . Back at home , when Skip had talked to his sister about the Candy Box , she had n't shared his enthusiasm for a stage career . " You ca n't use your own name , " she warned . " You know how stuffy Father and Mummie are ... and terrified of scandal . " Titanic confirmed the warning . " Do n't be so sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody gets down here sooner or later , " Blackie Cole added . Skip hated being in the cab with no one to talk to . He looked out the window and wondered if he 'd ever do anything with his life . His sister would know what to say to raise his spirits , but she was out on the island with Mummie . Another one of the crises that Mummie had managed to prolong through the weekend . A roll of thunder threatened summer showers . Skip got out in front of an unmarked door on Eighth Street just off Sixth Avenue . To find the Candy Box , you had to know where you were going . Three steps down from street level led him to the dimly lit bar . Skip stood silhouetted in the entrance until the shapes inside took on firm contours . Slender young men leaned against the bar or sat on stools . Older guys , some with women on their arms , sat at tufted wraparound banquettes along one wall . Beyond the bar was an oblong performance space , white-draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant star , with red and blue gelatinous shadows . In dresses of frothy pink chiffon , a chorus line of long-haired boys , including Titanic , swayed in time to an old standard . They sang , Life is such a drag . Short-haired girls in tuxedos knelt beside them . Skip liked the Candy Box because it was n't seedy like some bars he went to down by the river or uptown in the shadow of the Third Avenue El . The floorshow inside gave it glamour , and Titanic said they had the best protection money could buy . A straight audience of high brows , racketeers , celebrities , out-of-towners , lawyers , and Wall Street brokers gave the club an air of respectability . They came for the novelty and to spend money . But management allowed gay boys to gather in the bar , which was cruisy and more than a smidgen adventurous . Skip ordered a drink and leaned on the bar . He felt the caress of eyes on his flesh . A guy in a bomber jacket at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gypsy , swarthy with longish black hair . All he was missing was the golden earring . His eyes were like burnt-out cinders , where Skip read experience and mystery . If Titanic had decided the guys in the bar were n't worth the trouble , it was because she had n't seen this one . The man looked up , returned Skip 's blue-eyed stare , and flexed his shoulders . The boys and girls in the show wailed to the music , When I 'm not with you . Now Skip and the man stood side by side . Skip took in the man 's hands . Heavy veins and knuckles like walnuts . Blue-white sparks seemed to play around them with the promise of power and a tantalizing hint of danger . The hands cradled an empty glass . " Can I buy you a drink ? " Skip asked . " Sure . " His warm sweet breath broke over Skip 's cheek . " I 'll have what you 're having . " Skip carelessly threw a ten-spot on the bar . When he pocketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpted with his initials . Titanic had always warned him to keep his money out of sight . " Bottoms up . " The man raised his glass in a toast . He was a connoisseur of back-street brawls and barrooms , his voice coarse and self-assured . Skip leaned closer , offering up all his youth and good looks for inspection . " You like the show ? " " What can I say ? If those fairies want to dress up like that ... " He glanced over his shoulder . " Great legs though , and lots of laughs ! " The answer made Skip uncomfortable , but he longed to touch the face , burnished olive skin like antique bronze , and flaring nostrils above fleshy lips . The man drained his glass . " I got ta go inside , " he said . He skirted the crowd watching the show , and hesitated for a moment on the far side of the room in front of a red velvet curtain . Then he lifted the curtain and headed for the Gents . Skip 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing out from under him . He tried to slow down . Titanic would be green with envy when Skip told her about this number . The men 's room was lighted by a single incandescent bulb under milk glass . The glare flattened the porcelain urinals against the wall and threw dark shadows into the corners . Skip came in as the man turned away from the urinal . When they faced each other , Skip wanted to say something easy and joking . He moved closer and tried to kiss the man , who averted his mouth and pointed toward the two metal stalls . The last one had no door . Ancient phone numbers and hearts pierced by Cupid 's arrow were etched into the walls . Skip slipped inside and tried another kiss . " No . " The man pressed Skip onto the enamel toilet seat . The man stepped back , zipping his fly . " That 's 20 bucks you owe me , kid . " Skip took out a silk handkerchief and wiped his mouth . You had to expect these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Skip said , leaving himself room to maneuver . " There 's plenty of time . Let 's go somewhere . " " I 've got to meet some people , kid . " " Do n't be afraid , " Skip said . " We could have a few more drinks . " " Why should I be afraid of you ? " He ruffled Skip 's shining hair , and put out his hand palm up . " Well , maybe some other time . " " I do n't make dates with faggots . " The man spread his feet into a hustler 's stance . Skip laughed into the narrow space . " Who are you calling a faggot ? You could 've fooled me . " " C'm on , I saw you got money on you . " He grabbed for Skip 's pocket . Skip shielded it with both hands . " You ought a pay me . You got what you wanted . " " Hey , do n't get highfalutin ' on me . " The man nudged Skip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressers like you can afford it . I know who your old man is , and whatcha ca n't afford is for somebody to put a bug in his ear : ' Hey , didya know your little Lord Fauntleroy is queer ? ' " " You do n't know anything about me , " Skip muttered . " I 'm going back to the bar . " He stood up and tried to push his way out . The man pushed back , and the flimsy stall rocked as their bodies ricocheted against the walls . Skip lowered his shoulder and landed a surprising uppercut , a lucky sucker punch , as he twisted away . He wanted to smash something . Taller and heavier , his opponent recovered and collared Skip . " Whazzamatta with you ? " He stunned Skip with an open-handed slap . Another punch sent Skip crashing back into the stall , and he fell for what seemed a long time . The scarred metal walls rose up on either side . A black hole gaped in the plaster ceiling . Finally , the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet seat . Everything went silent and dark . The man straddled Skip , lifting him by the lapels of his suit . " Well , ai n't you the pretty one ? " he whispered tenderly , and dug deep for the money clip with its wad of bills . He pocketed Skip 's money and gave him a shake . " Get up for Chrissake ! " The kid was lying too still . Behind his head , a pool of thick blood was forming . Along Skip 's neck and over his heart , there was no pulse . The man seized Skip 's shoulders and shook the body harder . Blood spattered the stall . Skip 's left hand , flashing a ring with several carats of square-cut diamond set in platinum , waved convulsively as his life were draining away . The man backed away fast . Blinded by sweat , he stumbled over Skip 's legs . " A dead kid was n't part of the deal , " he muttered , sirens wailing inside his skull . Skip 's ring flickered ghost-like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stopped and cautiously reached across the body . If this was real , a couple of easy grand . He was forcing it over the knuckle when he heard the dull thud of footsteps outside the door .
