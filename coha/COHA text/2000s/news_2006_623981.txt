<p> Shatonda Yarbrough left the Bay Area for her native New Orleans to be part of the city 's rebirth after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina . She and others who had scattered across the nation came back home , put their kids in school , cleared debris and enjoyed crawfish dinners with relatives . <p> As the city stages its world-famous Mardi Gras parades , fewer than half its residents have returned , basic services are limited and some neighborhoods remain little more than block after block of smashed buildings and abandoned cars , a testament to the worst natural disaster in U.S. history . <p> Still , Yarbrough has no regrets about leaving California more than a month ago and driving home with her 4-year-old daughter , Miochie Martin . She 's coping with daily life in a struggling city , working part time . She has received payment for her wrecked home and awaits a mobile home from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . <p> " It 's sad to see a lot of what 's happened to people 's homes and lives , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather be here . This is where I need to be . " <p> The hurricane flooded thousands of Louisiana homes , hospitals and schools , and killed more than 1,100 people when it struck the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29 . Before the storm , 484,000 people lived in New Orleans  --  1.3 million in the greater metro area . Now , the population is about 200,000 , the city estimates . <p> Neighborhoods built on higher ground , such as the French Quarter and the central business district , were damaged to a lesser extent . New palm trees have replaced the ones uprooted by the storm near the Superdome , and at night light crowds walk along Bourbon Street 's collection of restaurants and clubs . <p> But in the eastern part of the city , large piles of debris  --  trees , mattresses , furniture and toilets  --  sit under freeways and on street corners . Entire blocks of homes in the Lower Ninth Ward collapsed or were swept into the street by the floodwaters . In neighboring St. Bernard Parish , there is strong smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some FEMA mobile homes are parked next to them . <p> Yarbrough 's red brick home in New Orleans East was flooded and partially scorched in fire that burned her next-door neighbor 's house to the ground . Her car still rests beside a canal on a nearby median . Yarbrough does n't go there very often . She also stays clear of the cemetery where many of her relatives are interred , because of the smell . <p> She 's been living in her mother 's home in Gentilly  --  a modest middle-class neighborhood  --  but recently learned she 'll get a mobile home by the end of the month . That 's good news for her , because seven people began living in her three-bedroom house days ago after a fire at the home of Yarbrough 's aunt . <p> " They say a vagrant set a house fire ( next door ) and the flames came over to her house , " Yarbrough said . " A lot of mysterious fires have been popping up around the city . " <p> Yarbrough regularly picks up Miochie and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few people in her extended family with a working car , which she bought during her stay in Oakland last year . Much of each day she spends running errands and taking relatives to appointments . <p> More than 9,000 children have enrolled in the city 's public schools , but few schools have reopened . Yarbrough had arranged for Miochie to attend one of the city 's best public schools , but space was no longer available when they got to New Orleans , so she enrolled Miochie in a $234-a-month parochial school . <p> On one recent afternoon , Yarbrough stood with a group of mothers on the school playground . Some had n't seen each other in months . <p> " Hey girl , how you doing ? " Yarbrough said , beaming at a woman who smiled and shouted back : " How you been ? " <p> They made small talk about electricity problems and insurance settlements . Yarbrough watched as a smiling Miochie came skipping outside in her school uniform and held her mother 's hand as they walked to the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , her mother thinks , of being surrounded by familiar people and places . <p> " This is a good school , " Yarbrough said . " I had to pay tuition , but this was the only school that could take her right away . I did n't want any gaps in her education . " <p> Yarbrough , a college graduate who taught special education students at New Orleans Adolescent Hospital before the hurricane , lived in Oakland on her personal savings and about $2,400 in FEMA rental assistance , but was not able to find work . After going home in January , she got a $93,000 flood insurance settlement on her damaged home , which paid off the balance of her mortgage . She now has a part-time job preparing tax returns . <p> She may not get her old job back , at least anytime soon , because the hospital has not reopened . Many other parts of the city are all but shut down , including neighborhoods once heavily populated by African American residents . Some of them were trapped on rooftops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water rushed into the bowl-shaped city . Many have not returned because their neighborhoods sustained the greatest damage . <p> Twenty-five million tons of garbage have yet to be cleaned up , one out of every four mortgages in Louisiana is delinquent , and thousands of residents have no electricity . <p> " Clearly , the city remains well behind what it was prior to Katrina , " said Matt Fellowes , an analyst with the Brookings Institution . " The federal government at the end of the day is the only game in town when it comes to rebuilding . The city is bankrupt and the state is bankrupt . And they 've lost a huge portion of their tax base . " <p> But Yarbrough 's cousin , Andray Glass , thinks the tragedy is an opportunity for him to build a better life . After Katrina forced him to leave his hometown for the first time , Glass and his fiancee ended up in Dallas , where they found steady jobs and a new home . The experience broadened his horizons and gave his life focus . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's need for labor . He works full-time shifts as a cook at two restaurants in the French Quarter . " I go to sleep in the morning dreaming about eggs  --  that 's how many I cook , " Glass said with a laugh . <p> When he 's saved enough money , he wants to go to cooking school to strengthen his credentials  --  and he someday plans to open his own restaurant . <p> Yarbrough expressed mixed feelings about the displaced poor of her city . <p> " I think it 's going to be a different city , " Yarbrough said . " A lot of people that had a negative impact on the city are no longer here . " <p> One big change is the large number of Latino day laborers who congregate at street corners throughout the city 's central business district , some carrying signs offering to work . On a recent afternoon , Yarbrough pulled into a mini-market parking lot lined with day laborers . <p> Santiago Reyes , 59 , of Durango , Mexico , and Nicanor Reteguin Aguirre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side a few feet from Yarbrough 's car , staring intently at the passing traffic . <p> Both men have hauled trash and worked on construction crews . They and other laborers ca n't afford apartments , so they sleep in parks or in abandoned cars under a nearby freeway . <p> Driving away from the store , Yarbrough looked at the faces of the men lining the street and shrugged her shoulders . " I understand why they 're here . I would wave to them and wish them luck . " <p> Once home , Yarbrough placed 7 pounds of fresh , red-colored boiled crawfish on the kitchen table for an impromptu celebration . In a nearby corner more than 50 family photos , salvaged from the fire at her aunt 's house , were spread out on the floor to dry . Some were faded and frayed at the edges . <p> Soon she and others were sitting around a huge mound of spicy crawfish and ears of corn , laughing and trading stories . <p> " Mmmmm . This is why I came home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . About an hour later , Glass came home carrying two additional bags of crawfish , unaware that Yarbrough had already bought some . <p> " Oh , wow , " Yarbrough said laughing . " Now we 're really gon na eat tonight . " <p> At first Yarbrough had mixed feelings about this year 's Mardi Gras and was n't sure whether she would join the celebration because of everything her family had been through . But she decided to take part because the event is part of what makes New Orleans special . <p> " That 's something that goes way back , " Yarbrough said . " It 's a very big deal .
