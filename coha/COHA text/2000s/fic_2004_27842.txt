Chapter One FRIDAY : UNCORKED The sun poured bright parallelograms of mote-swirling light through the venetian blinds of my rundown , rent-controlled house in Santa Monica . I was moving frenetically from bedroom to living room packing for a road trip with my best friend , Jack Cole . We were headed for the Santa Ynez Valley and a week of wine tasting before he was to be married the following Sunday . Though I could n't afford this impromptu excursion , I desperately needed to get out of L.A. The place was suffocating me , fueling paralyzing panic attacks that had been a chronic affliction of mine over the years . The phone rang , but the number that materialized on my caller ID did n't register so I stood frozen over the answering machine , waiting . " Miles , is Roman , " my landlord began in his Transylvanian-sounding drawl . " It is the fifteenth of September and I still not receive rent . Every month we go through this . If I do n't get check by tomorrow I have no choice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are my friend . I know you are starving writer ... " I levered the volume on the answering machine to 0 , the hair on my forearms tingling . The rest of Roman 's exhortation I could recite from memory . He would warm up with how lenient he had been , then he would launch into a foaming-at-the-mouth diatribe about how my financial shortcomings were the cause of his elevated blood pressure and a host of other onuses that daily racked him on the property owner 's cross . His jeremiads were worthy of Job and their intent was to make me feel guilty and scrape together the $850 in question . I resumed packing , the call pecking away at the edges of my already frayed psyche . Into my travel-scarred suitcase I threw a couple of bleak-themed novels I knew I would never crack . For good measure I added The Oxford Companion to Wine , Jancis Robinson 's brilliant and exhaustive tome on everything you ever wanted to know about the universe of wine . It was the perfect book to calm the nerves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motel room in a cold sweat , trembling from excess . After all , Jack and I were journeying to wine country , and I wanted to have the one book that had supplied me with all the basics of my one undying passion-besides , of course , the unrepentant penning of two unpublished novels and scores of unproduced screenplays . As I was about to shutter the house the phone rang a second time , jangling my nerves . I raced over to the caller ID , expecting it to be my disgruntled landlord again , amplifying on his first message with another warning salvo . But the number that came up on the display was a 212 area code so I lunged for the phone . " Hello , " I answered breathlessly . " Miles , " sang a cheery woman 's voice . " It 's Evelyn , your favorite agent . " She was the sixth in a long line of backstabbing sharks , but so far she seemed to be the rare exception : an agent who believed in me . " Evelyn , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In fact , she had that uncharacteristic lilt in her voice that promised argosies , ships of fortune that would diminish the pain of the thirty-five rejection letters from the who 's who of major publishing houses that I had arrayed on my living room walls : a festoon of failure , I proudly told everyone . " Some potentially good news , " Evelyn said . " Richard Davis at Conundrum liked your book . " My jaw dropped . The novel she was referring to had been shopped around New York for nearly a year now with no takers . There had been the first tier of submissions to the cream of the crop , when excitement was high and optimism exaggerated . Then there was the second tier : less prestigious houses , which meant less advance money , and considerably less budget for promotion once I got published , which I still assumed I would . The slow morphine drip continued as more rejection letters sluiced through Evelyn 's New York office and were shunted to me in L.A. Bringing up the rear was the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run and a move into the second tier . Short of vanity presses and the Internet self-publishing venues , this was where Evelyn disembarked and moved on to the BBD-bigger and better deal . We were clinging to tattered ribbons and we both knew it . " Great , " I replied , almost not wanting to hear the qualifications for fear they would put a damper on my excitement . " He 's passing it to the other senior editors to read over the weekend , I 'm expecting a decision toward the end of next week . Of course , he recommended some revisions . " " Of course , " I replied . " A publishing deal would certainly have that galvanic effect on me . " Evelyn laughed heartily , the gallows laugh of a hardworking agent who was n't getting any younger . " So , we 're in pretty good shape , " she said . " I 've got my fingers crossed . " " Terrific , " I replied , glancing at my watch . " I 'm getting ready to take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Santa Ynez Valley . An hour north of Santa Barbara . The poor man 's Napa/Sonoma . My friend Jack is getting married and we 're going to go out in style . It 's research for my next book , " I added . " Sounds like a blast , " she said . " Are you writing anything new , Miles ? " " Well , um , " I began haltingly . I glanced around at the rejection letters thumbtacked to my walls , their stinging words glaring reminders of why I had been unproductive recently . Of course , there was also the divorce , the dwindling bank account , the renewed wave of panic attacks , the loss of my film agent to the St. Vitus 's dance , and the sudden departure of a short-lived girlfriend who could n't put up with my occupational moodiness . " I 've got something brewing , " I said finally . " Something epic . " " Well , keep writing , " she encouraged . " And I 'll call you when I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , a hundred thoughts crisscrossing in my head . I had almost given up the book for dead-two years down the toilet and all the bad debts that backed up with it-but I was thrilled Evelyn had not . I made a mental note not to give up all hope in humankind . I locked up my house , threw my suitcase into the back of my Toyota 4Runner , and headed off to the weekly Friday afternoon wine tasting at Epicurus , where I was to rendezvous with the incorrigibly late Jack . Epicurus was a long railcar-shaped wine emporium wedged in between a mattress store and a spa that specialized in high colonics . Wine bottles were racked halfway up both walls and down the middle of the long rectangular space , arranged according to varietal and country of origin . The familiar crowd was packed into the small cordoned-off tasting area , affectionately dubbed The Bullpen , in the rear of the shop . In recent years The Bullpen had been witness to many wild Fridays after the owner had gone home , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually James would uncork bottle after bottle , recklessly cherry-picking the store 's inventory in retaliation for what he referred to as his insulting salary . It was the place to be on Friday for the Westside wine cognoscenti . This afternoon they were pouring Gary Farrell , a high-end vintner whose winery is smack in the middle of the Russian River Valley . Pinot Noir country . My grape . The one varietal that truly enchants me , both stills and steals my heart with its elusive loveliness and false promises of transcendence . I loved her , and I would continue to follow her siren call until my wallet-or liver , whichever came first-gave out . There was a buzz in The Bullpen when I arrived . A few people called out hellos and waved as I squeezed into the small space and found a clean glass . Most of the regulars were already holding court in their customary positions , arms crooked with wineglasses held below their noses . They included : Carl , an electrician at Warner Brothers , a small roly-poly man with a thirst for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's finest ( and the burst capillaries in his face to prove it ) ; Jerry , a reptilian-faced , paunchy man in his forties , dentist by trade , oenophile by avocation , who used the Friday tastings as a way to meet prospective new paramours even though we all knew he was married ; Eekoo , a wealthy Korean real estate entrepreneur who boasted a temperature-controlled bedroom stacked floor to ceiling with the finest California Cabernets , Chardonnays , and Pinots , the highly allocated ones , the mythical bottles you do n't find in wine stores . Eekoo 's trademark was the varietal-specific Riedel stemware he lugged around in a wooden case from tasting to tasting . Then there was Malibu Jim , a slender , sallow-faced man in his fifties who sarapled the wines , then typed in tasting notes on a laptop , research for a book he probably would never get around to writing . Recent newcomers , I noticed , were a pair of pleasantly plump office assistants who had discovered the best $5 party in the city and were fast becoming regulars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came reeking of perfume-a wine tasting no-no-but they were a load of laughs once they got a few tastes under their belts . And then there were the walk-ins , the one-timers , the curiosity seekers who heard the convivial banter in the back of the store , noticed wine being sampled , and thought it would be fun to join in . Sizing up the fresh dramatis personae , I became aware of three attractive women in their early thirties , huddled together , demarcating a proprietary space , conscious of the leering stares but determined to enjoy their afternoon outing . " Miles , " Carl called out , raising his glass , already flush in the face . He tended to arrive early and get a head start on the festivities . " Did n't think you were going to make it . " " Gary Farrell , are you kidding ? " I said as I elbowed my way over to the lineup . Manning the bottles was a matronly woman with a pie-shaped face and a friendly but strained smile . As disembodied arms snaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being poured . It usually began politely , then slowly deteriorated into a **34;226;TOOLONG line of attack . We were still in the polite phase of the afternoon when I held out my glass to her . " Would you like to begin with the Chardonnay ? " she asked over the din of voices . " Absolutely , " I said . She picked up an open bottle of the Farrell Sonoma and poured me a splash . I put my nose in the glass , inhaled deeply , and got a whiff of honeydew and underripe pears . On the palate the wine was indelicate , slightly oaky , very tropical-fruity , a little on the flabby side : a fairly typical California Chard for the Chard-swilling masses . I compared notes with Carl and he readily agreed . As I waited for Jack , I edged my way nearer the three women who were making their first appearance . They were deep into the reds and I sensed they were getting ready to head for the hills . " What do you think of the Farrells ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , dark-haired slip of a girl . " Mm . " She wrinkled her forehead . " I guess I like the Merlot the best . " Her pals concurred with her assessment , nodding and mmm-ing . I grimaced . Merlot , a quintessential blending grape , when left to its own devices almost always-Ptrus notwithstanding-results in a bland , characterless wine . " What about the Pinots ? " I asked , smiling what I hoped was a charming and knowing smile . " I did n't like ' em . " She formed her mouth into a tight little O trying to describe her displeasure with my favorite grape . Disenchanted , I backed my way toward the lineup of bottles , sensing I had struck out . As the crowd shifted and reshifted in the cramped space , I quickly sampled the second Chard , a single-vineyard wine with a better balance of fruit and acidity and subtler oak overtones that imparted a slightly smoky , almost nutty taste . " Excellent , " I said to the wine rep , when she asked if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back out . " Let 's get serious . " She reached for the first Pinot and poured me a splash . It was Farrell 's Sonoma standard , blended from a selection of vineyards . It gave off that unmistakable Pinot nose of cassis and blackberry , but it was n't distinguished , drifting in the mouth like a rudderless boat . The second Pinot was a single-vineyard from the nearby storied Rochioli property . It had notes of cardamom and exotic berries , and it pin-wheeled around on my palate , deliciously lingering . Mm , I thought to myself , rolling the wine around in my mouth , this is more like it . I shuffled my way through the crush of bodies back to where the three neophytes were winding up with the Cabs , hoping for one last shot . I was beginning to feel a little high and it emboldened me to re-approach them . " You do n't like this Rochioli Pinot ? " I asked . The dark-headed one shook her head again . " Really ? " I sipped and took another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to dazzling . " Jerry the dentist , face florid from having already traipsed through the lineup several times , butted in . " I do n't think it 's that dazzling , " he contended , hoping to curry favor with women I did n't think would give him the time of day . They all smiled at him and I drifted away for a second and final time . Ten minutes later he had the darkheaded one buttonholed against the wall and-more appallingly-she seemed fascinated by his ineloquent winespeak . Dispirited , I kept returning to the Rochioli as if to a trusted friend . As the rep poured me more , Carl sidled over to solicit my opinion . I barraged him with hyperbolic hosannas , reaching deep for the metaphors and the poly-syllabics , which always made him chuckle . " You 're right , " he said , after I had finished reeling off my lyrical account , the wine liberating my tongue to new heights of glibness . " Absolutely first-rate Pinot . " " How was Spain ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " Drink any good Riojas and Riberas ? " " Yeah , some really tasty ones . " He winked , then filled me in about a big feast at a winery where they roasted lambs over flaming vine cuttings . While listening to Carl 's chronicle of his Spain trip , I bypassed the Merlot and reached for the Zin , not wanting the rep to think I was hogging the Pinot . I refilled Carl with a scandalously healthy splash that drew an admonitory stare from the rep . We clinked glasses and laughed , delighting in our naughtiness . Then Carl bent close to my ear and whispered , " Woman in the black shirt and blond hair is checking you out . " I shot a furtive glance in the direction Carl was indicating . One of the dark-headed one 's friends was not just looking at me , but smiling . Continues ...
