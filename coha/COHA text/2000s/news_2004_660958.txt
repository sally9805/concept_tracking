<p> It 's a universal love story - she fell for the boy next door . But their romance has had an otherworldly outcome : the 18-year-old woman who ran off to marry the man of her dreams is now locked up at Kabul women 's prison , being held for the crime of defying her family 's wishes . <p> Behind these crumbling prison walls , in series of cold , crude cells where women sleep eight to a room , lies a medieval reality that sits just across the street from Kabul 's bustling downtown district full of shops where foreign visitors pick up carpets and leather jackets . Angela , who fears having her real name used , is one of many of those imprisoned here for so-called " love crimes " - relationship choices that , while unremarkable in the developed world , are grounds for imprisonment here . <p> Angela had known Jani Alam , a neighbor , all her life , and the two wanted to marry . But her father had other plans . He made a match for Angela with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to the province of Wardak to be with the man in an exchange for a bride price , Angela was miserable and ran away almost immediately . <p> " People said to me , ' Look how your father is cutting deals over you , ' " Angela blurts out . She takes a corner of her black headscarf and wipes her face and eyes , blurred by a watery glaze that comes from constant crying . " So I left . " <p> When she came back to Kabul , she and Jani Alam decided to elope . But when they tried to go to a municipal office to have a civil marriage , the officials there informed her father . Without his permission , they would not marry the young couple . <p> Angela 's father would n't agree to the marriage . And because the young couple had run off together , they were considered to have already cohabited , making them adulterers . Now they 're both stuck in jail - he in another building on the same prison grounds . <p> During a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in this prison were here for similar reasons . With the country still in a state of postwar flux , the law itself is fuzzy on the subject ; a mix of ancient traditions and cues from sharia , or Islamic law , rule instead . <p> Uncertain justice <p> Afghan law does not explicitly state whether people can choose whom they want to marry . To marry without parental consent , a young woman must be older than 16 , or for a young man , 18 . But custom is often more influential than law , says Anou Borrey , manager of legal projects for Medicam Mondiale , a German aid group . <p> " Parents think they need to give their consent , " says Dr. Borrey , and authorities follow their lead . <p> Eloping , however , can officially be treated as a crime . " That 's often because payment has been done as part of the engagement to someone else , " she explains . " If there 's an engagement that takes place and money is exchanged and a woman runs away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a woman is in jail for her own safety , " she says , in need of protection from family members with the couple for defying parents ' wishes . Police and the women themselves are often unaware of a limited number of shelters where they can turn for assistance . <p> Afghanistan 's new Constitution , adopted last December , promises that men and women will have equal rights . But some women 's rights advocates had hoped for far more explicit provisions . It will take years before the civil law is reviewed and applied to such cases , says Borrey . In the meantime , Medicam Mondiale is providing legal aid for women in prison , working with local lawyers to help in their cases . Of 66 cases they 've taken on so far , they 've won the release of 40 women , she says . <p> The right to divorce <p> They are also trying to prevent the next generation of tragic stories by changing the way marriage contracts are made , giving women the right to initiate divorce in certain circumstances . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage contract , where there are guidelines for divorce , " says Borrey . " There are ways of working around the existing law so that we do n't have to wait for changes in the law . " <p> Angela 's Afghan lawyers - who are paid by Medicam Mondiale - are visiting the prison today . It seems Angela 's father has a compromise to offer . If she says Jani kidnapped her , she will be released . But that , of course , might mean that the man she loves will rot in prison while she goes free - relatively speaking . She 's not sure of her safety once she 's outside the prison . <p> " At first , my father said he would kill me for this , " says Angela , the daughter of a policeman . " Now he says he 's not going to kill me . But I do n't know if I can trust him . " <p> To get out , she must sign documents she ca n't read - she has never been to school - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he abducted me . My father wants him in prison , " she sobs . " My father says , ' You will be released , and I will tell the people in the area that he was a bad guy and it 's his fault . ' And even if I do find a way to marry Jani , then my life will be terrible because my father will be like an enemy to me . " <p> Rana Said , a white-haired prison warden , grimaces sympathetically . At 42 , she 's been working in law enforcement for 20 years . In comparison with life under the Taliban , she says , things are better . She and the other female prison guards are no longer expected to drag female prisoners accused of adultery off to the public stadium to be whipped or stoned . But , she says , women still have no power in Afghan society , and can not make life decisions such as whom to marry without their fathers ' consent . <p> " There is no respect for women here , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper , " says Ms. Said . " It does n't really matter what women want . " She looks around at the decrepit brown walls that are falling into a deeper state of decay . " Sometimes I regret that I took this position , " she says . <p> Indeed , for a salary of $ 20 a month , Said finds herself in what may be one of the saddest workplaces in Kabul . The prison feels like Wuthering Heights meets Dungeons and Dragons - a combination of epic love stories and Spartan quarters . Lacking indoor plumbing , the women draw water from a pump in the dirt courtyard . There is intermittent electricity , and no glass on the windows , making it particularly cold for the 15 children here , some of them infants . <p> Shakeba , who has been in prison for 1-1/2 years , is here with Ravina , her 11-month-old baby . She had been married before while living as a refugee in Iran . But she divorced her first husband there and later returned to Kabul . After remarrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shakeba , who did n't keep her divorce papers with her when she came to Afghanistan , was put in jail . <p> " Someone told her first husband that the second husband would kill him , " one of the women explained as the cellmates huddled on their cots . The room holds six women and three children , packed in with almost indiscernible spaces between them . <p> " I blame my first husband for telling the authorities this lie , but I blame myself for not having my divorce papers , " says Shakeba , putting her lips to Ravina 's cheek . By day , the children have little to do and do not attend school . By night , Ravina and other babies sleep in their mothers ' cots . Shakeba wants to find a home for her ; her mother and sister are in other parts of the country , she says , leaving no one with whom she could leave Ravina . Many young children of women in prison , with nowhere else to go , do time with their mothers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " It 's cold here at night . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
