TRY AS SHE MIGHT , THE EDGY , LUMINOUS HOPE DAVIS CA N'T HELP BEING A MOVIE STAR . IN " THE MATADOR , " SHE EVEN CRACKS A SMILE NOW AND THEN . BY GREGORY KIRSCHLING // HOPE DAVIS GETS TO FROWN IN MOVIES MAYBE MORE THAN ANY ACTOR WORKING today . Take her 1998 leading lady debut , in the underrated romantic comedy Next Stop Wonderlatid : In the first acene , her gray-as-a-rain-cloud Boston nurse wearily walks under an umbrella-only to come upon her live-in boyfriend , who dumps her . As Jack Nicholson 's daughter in 20021S About Schmidt , Davis makes her entrance by rushing into Nicholson 's arms and sobbing ibr her dead mother . When she turns up in 2003 's American Splendor , her Joyce Brabner is miffed that she ca n't find the new Harvey Pekar comic ( " Why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster ? ! " ) . Even in the current photo accompanying her profile on the Internet Movie Database , the actress looks mildly heartbroken . In person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought full smiles . " In my real life , " she insists , over lentil soup and fries at a French place around the corner from her West Village apartment in Manhattan , " I feel like I 'm one of the happiest people I know . " After a two-year absence from the screen , during which she and her husband , actor Jon Patrick Walker , mostly tended to their two " little people " daughters Georgia , 3 , and Mae , 11 months-Davis , 41 , has returned this fall with four films . She 's already appeared as Nicolas Cage 's fed-up ex in The Weather Mail , as Gwyneth Paltrow 's controlling sister in Proof , and as a worried mother in Carroll BaIlard 's cheetah movie , lhtma . And now she plays Greg Kinnear 's wife in The , Matador , a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as a gone-to-seed hitman who strikes up an alliance with the straitlaced Kinnear in a Mexico City hotel bar . With these new projects , Davis continues her unusual career of revealing the sympathetic flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was , she figures , all because of Wonderland that she found this niche . " T really MWS that person , " admits Davis , who got divorced from her first husband right before fuming began . " I was single , I had been through a really bad time , I felt like a turtle kind of wallowing in my shell . It was very hard for me to make that movie , and I was all alone in Boston , in a very , very blue section of my life . " She is quiet for a moment . " The work evolves when you get another part , and then you 're getting called on to solve difficult characters , to inject a note of humanity into them . It 's more interesting for me to do that than to stand around and be sunny . " She immediately amends that . " Although-I have n't seen The Matador yet , but there 's the sunniest character I 've played in a while , right ? She 's kind of bubbly and silly , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actually mourning her dead child throughout the whole movie . That observation stops Davis for a second . " Yeah , I know , " she finally concedes , letting out a short laugh . " Exactly . " Then , simply , " I 'm not Cameran Diaz . " " It has something to do with her intellect , " says Campbell Scott , who , since calling up Davis to do a reading in 1990 , has appeared opposite her four times ( most memorably in 2003 's The secret Lives of Dentists ) and directed her once ( in 2001 's Final ) . " Someone who is as smart as Hope is , when she plays a good character , she 's going to darken it up a bit . And if she plays a dark character , she 'll make her kind of beautiful , crazy-attractive in some way . I think that comes from her desire to keep it all mixed up . " Davis " other project this year was performing before select New York and L.A. audiences with Meryl Streep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie Kaufinan . He called it Hope Leaves the Theater , and the actors may stage it again in 2006 for HBO . " You feel that you 're watching something very real when you watch her , " Kaufman says . " We have this movie version of the way we think people are , but she comes closer than many actors to the real version of the way people are , and that 's why you want to watch her . " AND SHE SEEMS AS NORMAL OFF SCREEN AS SHE IS ON screen . For starters , she works out at the YMCA . " I go swimming there with the kids , and it 's so great , unlike all the health clubs where I 'm so intimidated , " Davis says . " A year and a half ago , I joined Equinox , and I went three times and never again , I felt so out of shape . It 's like , Where are these people from ? I just ca n't deal with it . But at the Y , they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old guys there , and people of all colors . It 's not these little gym goddesses-it 's filled with regular people . " For the past 12 years , home has been a modest two-bedroom , second-floor walk-up . These days it sounds crowded-with the family of four plus their wheaten terrier , Charley-but Davis says she does n't have the couple million it would take to buy another place in the West Village . " I do smaller films , I 'm not getting big paydays , " she explains . " I feel like we 're just kind of scraping together here . " Yet she ca n't imagine living anywhere else . After lunch , Davis strolls over to nearby Washington Square Park and finds a bench under a tree , opposite the dog run where she used to bring Charley until , in his old age . he started getting into " really bad fights " with the other pups . While she talks , she soaks in the park bustle , admiring a street performer blowing on an offkey horn and then a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggies biting each other 's legs like that " ) . Mom says she brings her little people here every day . In 2002 , she married Walker , who the next year played a dental assistant in The secret Lives of Dentists . " He 's a very , very grounded , happy actor , " his wife reports . " He 's not one of those crazy , unfulfilled , always-needing-more actors . He 's real nice . " They met on a blind date , when they went to see the IMAX movie Everest . And it 's true that they do n't own a TV . " Oh , God , " Davis moans , " do you have to write that ? It sounds so pretentious . People are so annoyed by that sort of thing . It was my husband 's idea , not mine . " This kind of outburst Hounds just like something her character in Next Stop Wonderland would say . " Hope 's a straight talker , " says Richard Shepard , who directed The Matador . " She 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I really like about her . She 's definitely got a New York spirit , an indie spirit . " Shepard tells a story about an early table reading of the Matador script It was arranged to try to seduce Brosnan into taking the risky lead role , and Davis agreed to read the part of Bean-for free . " I had never met her before , " Shepard recalls , " and she said at a break , " Why are you having this table reading ? ' And I said , " Well , we 're trying to convince Pierce to do this movie , ' and she said , " He 'd be an idiot if he did n't do this movie ! ' and walked right over to Pierce , who she had n't met before that day , and said , " Pierce , you 're crazy if you do n't commit to this movie ! ' Which was one of the most loving and nicest things that I 've ever seen . She really helped close the deal . " ONE OF DAVIS " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lost the part to Christina Applegate . " I for sure was getting that job , " she says . " I swear to God , the guy loved me ! He was laughing and laughing . I thought , I 'm going to get this . I do n't know what happened . " If she 'd landed it , her life would 've worked out differently . " I 'd have a much bigger apartment , " she cracks . She also auditioned , improbably enough , for Baywatek . Davis ' woret moment on a set was probably shooting her first take on her first film 15 years ago . After college at Vassal- , the Tenafly , N.J. , native had come up through the Chicago theater , where director Joel Schumacher gave Davis her big break in a stage production of David Mamet 's Speed-the-Plow . Then he cast her as Billy Baldwin 's girlfriend in Ftatliners-and that 's where it all went wrong . In her first scene , she got flummoxed when the cameras started rolling , ao she stopped and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and said , Oo n't you ever say cut ! ' ' " she recalls . " I feel that one moment scared me so thoroughly that I 've been really well prepared ever since . " She next played the French ticket agent in Hume Alone , before gradually segueing into indies , with ensemble parts in The Daytrippers and The Myth Fingerprints . Five years after Next Stop Wonderland , she nearly passed on the film that would earn her a Golden Globe nomination , American Splendor . " When I read the script I did n't understand how it was going to work with the comic-book panels . It did n't make any sense to me , " she admits . " And my agent said , " You should work on this , " and I 'm like " - she hufls ( inadvertently channeling Joyce Brabner ) - ' ' " All right , whatever , but I do n't get this script . ' I did n't want to go to Cleveland . The movie really surprised me . " For 2006 , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-life con artist Clifford Irving , who wrote a fake Howard Hughes autobiography ; and InfaniO'iis , another movie about Truman Capote and In Cold Blood . Davis plays Slim Keith , the socialite and Capote confidante . " We all just assumed that theirs could n't be as interesting as ours , and then Capote came out and had such great reviews , " she says . " I liked Capote . I thought Phil " - Philip Seymour Hoffman , who played that boyfriend who dumped her in Wonderland-'Vas terrific , but I was so happy when I saw ours . It 's incredible . And very different in tone-there 's a lot of stuff of him in New York , like parties at Diana Vreeland 's house . " And now ? " Well , " she says , " I 'm looking for a job . I 'm reading some big-studio stuff and there 's an independent thing that I 'm going to look at this weekend . Nothing is out there right now that I 'm dying to have . I just kind of hang on till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then again , it does n't feel so treacherous now . But you never know when it 's going to end , especially as a woman . I was never the ingenue , so hopefully that 'll make it easier to age and still work . I know a lot of actors who are really dissatisfied with where they 're at even though some of them are huge stars and I feel like , Oh , my God , you 're at the top . ' Something interesting will come . It always does . I have faith . " Hone has faith ! The on-screen frowner is full of cheer . " And it 's going to be something aood .
