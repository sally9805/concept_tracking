<p> This year , the banner ceremony to celebrate the Nets ' second straight Eastern Conference championship was deliberately understated . Lou Lamoriello , the Nets ' chief executive , did not want to overplay the team 's achievement , because they had again lost in the N.B.A. finals . <p> So hours before the tipoff on opening night at Continental Arena , Lamoriello changed the pregame ceremony ; instead of raising the banner to the rafters , a spotlight was directed on a banner already hanging from the ceiling . Streamers fell , but so did the faces of some surprised Nets officials . <p> Chances are , that would never have happened in Madison Square Garden had the Knicks been able to make back-to-back appearances in the finals . In a place where hype and hoops co-exist , the Knicks would find a way to celebrate  --  were there to be such an occasion . <p> But there is n't likely to be one any time soon . Instead , as the teams prepare to meet tonight for the first time this season , the buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different reasons . <p> The Nets , with a 3-5 record , are struggling , but they remain one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference and have been retooled to return to the finals . But amid the increasingly distracting backdrop of a potential sale and move , they continue to have trouble drawing fans and currently have the second-lowest attendance in the National Basketball Association . <p> Nine miles away , the Knicks , at 2-5 , are stumbling toward their third straight losing season , watching as empty seats dot the Garden , and hoping that the return of Antonio McDyess  --  as early as next week  --  can resurrect their season before it is too late . <p> Just two years ago , Jason Kidd marched into New Jersey and proclaimed that the Nets were No. 2 in the New York metropolitan area , but would soon be No. 1 . He was right , if only in the won-lost column . But even Kidd , with his uncanny vision , could not have foreseen the problems now confronting both teams . No one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knows where the Knicks are headed on it . <p> On the Court <p> Nets Coach Byron Scott and Knicks Coach Don Chaney reacted to losses this week in the same way , saying their teams played scared . <p> Certain players  --  Kurt Thomas of the Knicks and Kenyon Martin and Richard Jefferson of the Nets  --  bristled at the suggestion . And both coaches had to hastily talk to their players the next day to explain themselves . <p> Neither Scott nor Chaney said he was scared about his job status , although Scott entered the season on the last year of his contract , without the Nets showing any inclination of giving him an extension . " I think Byron is doing fine , " Rod Thorn , the Nets ' president , said . " You ca n't hold him accountable for the injuries and lack of depth . " <p> James L. Dolan , the chairman of Madison Square Garden and the executive who oversees the Knicks , has twice extended Chaney 's contract  --  it now runs until 2006  --  even though Chaney has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Gundy in December 2001 . <p> " No , I 'm not worried about my job , " Chaney said . " And it 's not because I have a guaranteed contract , either . I know  --  and I 've been in this place before  --  that I 'm doing the best I can do , preparing the team . " <p> Chaney has , however , revealed the strain he is feeling these days . He ranted to reporters on Monday morning in Cleveland , reacting to criticism of how he had been using center Dikembe Mutombo , then ranted to his players on Monday night after they played without effort in losing to the Cavaliers . <p> " I let myself go and I got upset , " he said of his tirade to reporters . " That wo n't happen again . " <p> Chaney said that his job in preparing players only goes so far . " I can control them in the locker room , I can control them here , " he said of the practice court . " I ca n't control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react as basketball players . " <p> Tellingly , the Knicks are putting their faith in the return of McDyess , who scrimmaged twice with the team this week , but is not yet ready to return after a two-year layoff and three knee surgeries . <p> In the meantime , the off-season acquisitions of Keith Van Horn and Mutombo have yielded inconsistent results and Mike Sweetney , the Knicks ' first-round pick , is averaging just 4 minutes a game . <p> The plan , according to General Manager Scott Layden , was to get bigger and younger , which he accomplished by trading Latrell Sprewell for Van Horn . " We feel with this team we can win . We like the roster , " he said . <p> But the Knicks are slow and stuck with five power forwards . They have no depth at shooting guard and possess the highest payroll in the league . And they are still looking for a point guard , as Chaney unintentionally let slip in the preseason . <p> The Nets , despite signing Kidd to a six-year , $103 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have holes , too . Kerry Kittles , Richard Jefferson and Jason Collins have been consistent , and Kenyon Martin has been hurt , but Kidd has had to play too much ; yesterday the Nets signed Robert Pack to be his veteran backup . <p> Still , the Nets have made a remarkable transition in recent seasons , one the Knicks can only dream of . <p> " I think the Knicks are different when you judge them because they lock into a lot of players , so you ca n't turn the ship around real quick , " said one Eastern Conference general manager . " New York 's different , " he added . " Nobody 's looking for what you 're trying to do to build the team  --  you got to live in the present . " <p> Off the Court <p> The Knicks ' losing record the last two seasons has directly affected the team 's ticket sales . Last November the Knicks ' string of 433 consecutive sellouts was snapped ; since then , they have had to aggressively market themselves , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with season ticket-holders declining to renew because of apathy or economy , there is no longer a waiting list . <p> Steve Mills , the president of the Garden in charge of team operations , said that the decline in season tickets  --  Sports Business Journal estimates the number of tickets at 12,600  --  was not significant . " It is down less than 10 percent from last year , " he said . <p> In three games at the Garden this season , the Knicks ' average attendance is 18,744 , about 1,000 under capacity . The Knicks are soliciting groups like college alumni organizations and using e-mail messages for a ticket exchange program to reduce no-shows . Their last home game , last Friday night against Sacramento , brought in some A-list celebrities and the Knicks ' electric victory over the Kings brought back reminders of the old days . <p> And then they lost two putrid games on the road . <p> As for the Nets , they seem to almost prefer playing on the road these days , where they can be energized by electric crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , the Nets ' average attendance improved by nearly 2,000 fans a game to 15,185 , the seventh lowest in the league . Through four games this season , the Nets are next-to-last in attendance , averaging 13,530 fans . Perhaps it is not a coincidence that the Nets have lost their last three games at home , all played before a lot of empty seats . <p> The N.B.A. 's commissioner , David Stern , noted that the Nets ' revenue from gate receipts has actually increased this season because the Nets are filling in the more expensive seats . <p> But underlying and perhaps fortifying the low attendance is the impending sale of the team . The Nets could end up in Brooklyn or Long Island , or Newark , and Continental Arena is already taking on something of a lame-duck status . <p> The players say they are not distracted by the impending sale or the empty seats . " I 'm not worried about the support , " Mourning said . " Our strength comes from right here , in this little unit here . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ticket to come see us play . " <p> Who 's No. 1 ? <p> The Nets have won 9 of their last 10 games over the Knicks , overmatching them with athleticism . Yet , somehow , it does n't fully resonate in the metropolitan area . <p> " The unfortunate thing about it , having been here in this market for a long time , I do n't think the Nets will ever be No. 1 , " said Willis Reed , who starred for the Knicks , coached both teams , represented the Nets as an executive for 15 years and returned to the Knicks as a special adviser this summer . " You 're fighting something that you ca n't win . You 're fighting history . " <p> Reed looks up at the championship banner of 1973 hanging in the Knicks ' sparkling practice facility , pleased to be back with his old team , the one everybody always asked him about . <p> " It 's hard to leave a good team . To be where a team is winning is always good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Knicks will win again . " We have enough talent here to get back to the playoffs , " he said . " That 's going to be our major challenge . " <p> For the Nets , the challenge is raising a championship banner , before a full house , wherever that may be . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
