One of the most frequently mentioned activities is leading a classroom discussion . I then ask them to describe the behaviors they envision their students exhibiting during those classroom discussions . Usually , I receive responses such as all the students are participating in the discussion , everyone is listening respectfully , and all are offering insightful and clearly articulated opinions . But when I ask , " How many times in elementary and secondary school have you been involved in a classroom discussion like the one you just described ? " , sadly , most students can count the number of times on one hand . Why ? If leading a classroom discussion is an activity most preservice teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions happen so infrequently ? " I guess , " one student said , " it must be the questions asked . " <p> Researchers have noted that one of the key skills critical to proficient teaching is verbal questioning ( Carlson 1991 ; Danielson 1993 ; Hunkins 1972 ; Ralph 1999 ; Smith , Blakeslee , and Anderson 1993 ) . With teachers asking about 300 to 400 questions per day ( Levin and Long 1981 ) and , depending on the type of lesson , as many as 120 questions per hour ( Carlson 1991 ; Carlson 1997 ; Graesser and Person 1994 ) , it is essential that they be skilled in using verbal questioning . Unfortunately , researchers studying teachers ' use of verbal questioning report that that skill is typically less effective than it could be ( Anderson and Burns 1989 ; Dantonio 1990 ; Graesser and Person 1994 ) . <p> A common problem with many teachers ' use of verbal questioning is a lack of knowledge about questioning taxonomies and sequencing ( Barnes 1979 ; Good and Brophy 2000 ; Lucking 1978 ; Pollack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article , I compare different question taxonomies and then review relevant research on question sequencing and patterns . I include an activity based on the use of political cartoons designed to improve verbal questioning . Question Taxonomies <p> Taxonomies have been defined as human constructs used to classify questions based on the intellectual behavior or mental activity needed to formulate an answer ( Morgan and Schreiber 1969 ) . They are similar to a continuum . At one end are questions that may have only one correct answer and require only minimal mental activity . At the other end are more complex questions that require greater mental activity . <p> Arguably , the most famous question taxonomy is Bloom 's taxonomy of cognitive objectives , created by Benjamin Bloom and his associates . The following six levels of intellectual behavior comprise the taxonomy ( Bloom 1956 ) : Knowledge . The knowledge level is the lowest level , with students only asked to recall information . For example , " Define affirmative action . " Comprehension . At the comprehension level , students put information in another form . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy ? " Application . Students must apply known facts , principles , or generalizations to solve a problem . A sample question is , " To what extent , if any , does any amendment to the Constitution apply to affirmative action in college admissions ? " Analysis . The teacher asks students to identify and comprehend elements of a process , communication , or series of events . An example would be , " In what ways are the arguments of those who oppose a race-conscious admissions policy different from those who support it ? " Synthesis . Students are asked to engage in original creative thinking . They consider the question , " Under what conditions , if any , would you support a race-conscious admissions policy and why ? " Evaluation . Now at the highest questioning level , students determine how closely a concept or idea is consistent with standards or values . For example , " After assessing the Supreme Court arguments and rulings in affirming the constitutionality of affirmative action in college admissions , can you summarize the extent to which they are consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Although Bloom 's taxonomy is well known , there are other questioning taxonomies . Table 1 contains a comparison of Bloom 's taxonomy with the questioning taxonomies of Sanders ( 1966 ) , Carner ( 1963 ) , Pate and Bremer ( 1967 ) , Enokson ( 1973 ) , and Gallagher and Ascher ( 1963 ) . <p> Of the six question taxonomies listed in table 1 , Sanders ' taxonomy has categories closest in comparison to Bloom 's taxonomy . In fact , four of Sanders ' categories  --  Application , Analysis , Synthesis , and Evaluation  --  are the same as those in Bloom 's taxonomy . There are , however , some minor differences between Sanders ' and Bloom 's taxonomies . In what Bloom calls the Knowledge category , Sanders ' calls the Memory category . And , in place of Comprehension , Sanders has two separate categories  --  Translation and Interpretation . Translation questions require students to change the form of communication . For example , " What ideas are expressed in the video ? " Interpretation questions ask students to relate different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generalizations . For example , a teacher asks students to compare the educational opportunities available for students living in rural communities with those of students living in the inner city . <p> Carner ( 1963 ) identified three levels of questions : Concrete , Abstract , and Creative . Concrete questions deal with the tangible and observable , as in , " What are the graduation requirements for your high school ? " Abstract questions require students to generalize , classify , and relate information . An example would be , " What are the similarities in the policies of the United States and France on the United Nations ' sanctions against Iraq ? " Creative questions are at the highest level of complexity and require students to use both concrete and abstract thinking . At that level , students discuss the possible courses of action that the United States might take to prepare for a terrorist attack . <p> Pate and Bremer ( 1967 ) , Enokson ( 1973 ) , and Gallagher and Ascher ( 1963 ) use the terms convergent and divergent in their taxonomies . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only levels of questions . Convergent questions have only one possible answer , as in the sample , " What city is the capital of Tennessee ? " Divergent questions have more than one answer . An example is , " Should federal income taxes be decreased ? Why or why not ? " <p> Enokson ( 1973 ) expands the notion of convergent and divergent questions to include levels of low and high . A low-level convergent question has only one possible answer and requires only simple recall of data ; for example , " Who was the third President of the United States ? " Nonetheless , a convergent question can also produce high-level thinking . A high-level convergent question is , " Which of these states is closer in distance to Tennessee ? " There is only one possible answer , but higher-order mental operations are required . <p> Divergent questions can produce low-level thinking . A divergent question with different possible answers but requiring simple recall of data  --  " What are the names of three former presidents of the United States ? "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most complex type according to Enokson 's taxonomy . This question type has different possible answers and produces higher-level thinking . An example is , " Describe several scenarios that could lead to an improved economy . " <p> Gallagher and Ascher ( 1963 ) use memory and three different types of thinking to describe the question levels in their taxonomy . The lowest question level is Cognitive-Memory . A Cognitive-Memory question only requires simple processes such as recognition , rote memory , and selective recall , as when a teacher asks a student to name the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution . Convergent Thinking is the next level , which is a combination of Bloom 's Application and Analysis levels . It is convergent because there is only one expected answer , but it requires an analysis and integration of given or remembered data . An example is , " Can you sum up in one sentence why President Bush decided to send military forces into Iraq ? " Divergent Thinking , the next level of this taxonomy , requires using independently generated data or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample question is , " Suppose the United States had won the Vietnam War . What impact would that have had on foreign policy in Southeast Asia ? " Evaluative Thinking is the highest level of this taxonomy , and it requires dealing with matters of judgment , value , and choice . A sample question is , " Have major collegiate football and basketball programs become a detriment to colleges ' or universities ' mission of higher learning ? " Question Sequencing and Patterns <p> Being a skillful questioner requires not only an understanding of the cognitive levels of individual questions but also an understanding of question sequencing and patterns ( Barnes 1979 ; Good and Brophy 2000 ) . Question sequencing is a series of questions designed so that each question builds on the answer to the previous one ( Wragg and Brown 2001 ) . Wragg and Brown analyzed more than a thousand questions asked by teachers during classroom discussions . They found that 53 percent of questions stood alone and 47 percent were part of a sequence of two or more questions . Of the questions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent were part of a sequence of more than four questions ( Wragg and Brown 2001 ) . <p> Researchers have noted six patterns of questions ( Brown and Edmondson 1989 ; Good and Brophy 2000 ; Taba 1971 ; Wilen and White 1991 ; Wilen 2001 ; Wragg and Brown 2001 ) . The first pattern is called extending and lifting ( Taba 1971 ) . That questioning pattern involves asking a number of questions at the same cognitive level or extending , before lifting the level of questions to the next higher level . The circular path , which is the second questioning pattern ( Brown and Edmondson 1989 ) , involves asking a series of questions that eventually lead back to the initial position . The third pattern is called same path or extending ( Brown and Edmondson 1989 ) and involves asking questions that are all at the same cognitive level . Narrow to broad is the fourth questioning pattern ( Brown and Edmondson 1989 ; Good and Brophy 2000 ; Taba 1971 ; Wilen 1991 , 2001 ) . That pattern involves asking lower-level , specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning pattern is called broad to narrow or funneling ( Brown and Edmondson 1989 ; Good and Brophy 2000 ; Wilen and White 1991 , Wilen 2001 ) . That question sequence begins with lower-level , general questions followed by higher-level , specific questions . The last questioning pattern is called a backbone of questions with relevant digressions ( Brown and Edmondson 1989 ) . In that sequence , the focus is not on the cognitive level of the questions but on how closely the questions relate to the central theme , issue , or subject of the discussion . Using Political Cartoons <p> Many teachers use political cartoons as a resource to aid student learning . Their interpretation requires students to use a number of lower-and higher-level thinking skills , such as identifying the subject or issue , explaining the use of historical references and images , locating and identifying the source , interpreting the message or viewpoint , and judging the cartoonist 's bias in terms of one 's own point of view ( DeFren 1988 ; Heitzmann 1988 , 1998 ; Holub and Bennett 1988 ; Langeveld 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of accountability , the activity prepares students for standardized tests containing political cartoon questions ( Heitzmann 1998 ) . <p> Political cartoons can also be a resource to enhance teachers ' instructional practice . Teachers find that political cartoons , when combined with a specific taxonomy , questioning pattern , and sequence , help them develop and improve their verbal questioning . <p> When I teach verbal questioning in my methods classes , I give each student a handout with twenty different political cartoons . I then instruct them to pick one cartoon , interpret its meaning , and then write a series of questions to teach the meaning of the political cartoon . After completion , I ask two or three students to use their series of questions , known as a question script , to lead a classroom discussion on the meaning of the political cartoon they had chosen . By the end of the activity , most students realize that asking questions and leading a classroom discussion  --  even with a question script  --  is not easy . <p> After presenting information about taxonomies , questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another activity using political cartoons . I ask students to pick another political cartoon from the handout , interpret its meaning and write a question script in which they use a questioning pattern that contains at least one question from each category of Gallagher and Ascher 's questioning taxonomy . I use that taxonomy because there are just enough categories in the taxonomy so that most students recognize the different levels of questions without having difficulty in identifying the category in which the questions belong . <p> After the students complete their question script , I give them a copy of a classroom observation instrument ( see figure 1 ) adapted from Sadker and Sadker ( 1997 ) . On the instrument , they can record the questioning pattern , indicate the level ( category ) of each question asked by the teacher , and identify the student who answered the question . I ask two or three students who did not lead a classroom discussion during the first activity to teach the meaning of a political cartoon to the class . Before each discussion , I ask two students not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instrument . After each discussion , the students completing the Classroom Observation Instrument report their findings . This activity can also be used to help practicing teachers improve their verbal questioning . Instructors may also wish to have a colleague observe and complete the Classroom Observation Instrument . <p> Generally , students leading a discussion during the second activity do a better job than students in the first activity . Questions in the second activity have a distinct pattern , are well sequenced , and reach different cognitive levels . <p> Asking questions and leading classroom discussions can have a positive impact on student learning . Questions and discussions can serve as a monitor of student comprehension , help students make connections to prior knowledge , and stimulate their cognitive growth . Alas , good questions and classroom discussions do not just happen ; success there requires knowledge , planning , and skill . Teachers must understand the many elements of verbal questioning and have a willingness to practice them . The use of political cartoons can help teachers achieve their goals . The cartoons ' unique blend of caricature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use verbal questioning effectively and productively . TABLE 1 .
