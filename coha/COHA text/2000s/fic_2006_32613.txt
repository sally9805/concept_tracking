Speak of the Devil By Richard Hawke Random House Richard Hawke I If she had known she would be dead in another five minutes , maybe she would n't have swatted her son so hard . That 's just my guess . His balloon had been drifting into my face , that was the problem . It was n't bugging me , but it was bugging his mother . He was a towheaded kid with a round pink face . The balloon was larger than his head . I could n't say one way or the other if the kid was having fun , but Mom clearly was n't . " Ezra , if I have to tell you one more time . " She seemed to be wound awfully tight for nine-thirty in the morning . But I 've never been a parent , so I 'm hardly the person to judge . Maybe the kid was an absolute handful and his actions drained his mother daily of her reservoir of patience . Maybe the reservoir was n't terribly deep to begin with . Or maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten her caffeine jangle for the day . Maybe this , maybe that . Maybes all over the place . Cheaper than a dime donut , as my father used to growl . It was a Thursday . Thanksgiving is always a Thursday , so that part is easy . Fall was playing out nice and slow . The trees in Central Park were more yellow and red than I 'd seen them in years . A high , bright sun was sending down just about zero warmth through the bracingly crisp air . What they used to call apple-cider weather . I was standing at the corner of Seventy-second and Central Park West . I was n't supposed to be standing there . I was supposed to be making my way up five flights of stairs in a turn-of-the-century brownstone halfway down Seventy-first , swinging my bag of bagels and whistling a happy tune . I had fetched the bagels ( three poppy , three sesame ) from a place on Columbus that makes them on the premises , but instead of trotting directly back to Margo 's like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lured by the sound of crashing cymbals , and was standing on the corner dodging a white balloon and watching Mother Goose roll by . Big pointy hat . Oversize smile . Mother Goose , that is . Not me . I was hatless . And I was n't smiling . When I see a gun being drawn in a crowd and it 's not attached to a cop or to someone I know and trust , generally speaking , I do n't smile . Central Park West runs northsouth . The parade runs south . Been that way since the late twenties . Back then they used to release the big balloon figures at the end of the parade . There were only a few of them , so it was n't as if the skies of Manhattan suddenly darkened with a flotilla of giant balloons . You could n't do it today . You 'd have scrambled F-16 fighter jets intercepting the balloons faster than you could blink . I was standing on the west side of the street , directly in front of the Dakota , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie Rosemary 's Baby , you 've seen the Dakota , although they called it something different in the movie . In the book , too . Richard Nixon tried to get his suitcase in the door of the Dakota not long after he was bounced from the White House , but the residents there would have none of it . It 's that kind of place . When I think of that story , it 's actually Nixon 's wife I imagine . Poor beleaguered Pat . I imagine her standing on the sidewalk with her skinny arms crossed over her skinny chest , one of her dull practical pumps tapping irritably against the pavement . Well , Mr. I-am-not-a-crook . . . what next ? The gun was a Beretta 92F . That 's nine-millimeter . Eight and a half inches long , a fraction over two pounds . Magazine capacity of fifteen bullets . The Beretta is one of the most popular pistols these days with both police and military shooters . The guy holding this one was neither . And though it 's a good-looking gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply so he could admire it in the morning sun . I instinctively slapped at my left shoulder . My gun is a simple .38 . Short-barreled snubbie . A simple workhorse . No fancy history . I use it in my line of work , which is private investigation . Margo calls it my associate , a little joke she picked up from her father , from when he was a private investigator and he used to call his gun his associate . This was before he took on a real associate . A junior partner . Which was me . Green , eager , fearless and , at the time , extremely pissed off . Nothing came between my slap and my shoulder . My associate was back at Margo 's , in its holster , up on the dresser . Safety on . Facing the wall . The guy with the Beretta was up on the low stone wall that borders the park . It was a fluke that I had a clear view of him . There was a gap between the Mother Goose float and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teenagers from Berlin , Maryland , and I happened to be standing where I could see right through the gap . The man was about five-eight or so . He was wearing a green windbreaker , khaki pants , sunglasses and a baseball cap . I saw him unzip his windbreaker and pull the Beretta from his belt , then take a step backward and drop off the wall , out of sight . The white balloon drifted into my face again . The mother slapped the boy on his small arm . Very hard . " Ezra , for the last time . " I heard the boy begin to cry as I took off running . As I hit the street , the shooter 's head reappeared above the stone wall . He planted his elbows on the wall and took aim . His target was clear . The easiest of all . Mother Goose . " Get down ! " I threw my bag of bagels at the float . It hit the float just below the platform where Mother Goose was standing . I yelled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her attention . The pointed hat dipped my way , a look of irritation replacing her waving-at-the-crowd smile . I saw the spark from the Beretta across the street and heard the shot a half-instant behind . Mother Goose dropped to her knees . . . and all hell broke loose . I was still running . A chunky policeman who had been stationed on the corner not twenty feet from the shooter reacted simultaneously to the gunshot and to the sight of a loony -- me -- racing from the curb into the parade route , yelling and shouting . He started for me . I cried out , " Gun ! Gun ! Gun ! " and pointed toward the wall , but the cop was n't hearing . He was going for his own gun . Behind him , the shooter rose calmly to his full height , swung the Beretta to the street level and fired again . I swerved , crashing into a copper-skinned teenager holding a bass drum . More shots rang out as the drummer and I tumbled to the street . The shots continued . The drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with a shiny alto sax -- planted her foot on it . Blood was pumping onto the white bib of her uniform . Nothing had even registered yet on her face . I got to my feet . People were scrambling for cover , though here and there were pockets of onlookers who remained frozen , unable to process . The chunky policeman was on the ground , not moving . The Mother Goose float had halted , its Styrofoam wings still flapping mechanically . The shooter might as well have been standing at a carnival shooting gallery . He was pointing and shooting , pointing and shooting , pointing and shooting . To my left , a skinny guy in a Macy 's T-shirt lifted off the ground with the force of the bullets slamming into his chest . Pop ! Pop ! Pop ! Hunched over , I scuttled across the pavement to the policeman . He was lying on his right side . I knelt down and shoved him onto his back . A piece of skull the size of a doorknob was gone from the right side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holster and pulled out his service revolver , then ran to the near side of the float , putting it between me and the shooter . I ran along the float , flipping off the gun 's safety , and came around the rear with the gun in both hands , aimed at the stone wall . He was gone . A squirrel was perched on the wall almost exactly where the shooter had been . Tail high . Head high . Tense and alert . I suppressed a roaring urge to blow it to bits . I took off running . Holding the pistol down next to my leg , I crossed the street and started up the paved path that leads into the park . Some hundred or so feet in from the street , the path opens to a small plaza . There 's a decorative stone circle embedded in the walkway . The word imagine is inscribed in mosaic on the circle . The city did this after John Lennon was murdered in 1980 outside the Dakota , which was where he lived . Him they let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , the plaza was eerily quiet . As usual , several kids were seated on the periphery of the imagine circle , strumming guitars and softly singing " All You Need Is Love . " A girl in an oversize army coat was arranging flowers on the pavement . The paved path continues past the memorial into the park . Benches and bushes line the path for another thirty feet , until it comes to a small clearing . That was where the shooter came from . He dashed from the clearing onto the path and raced farther into the park , in the direction of the Bethesda Fountain . I chased . He turned to look back and saw me charging after him . His arms pumped even harder , and he reached the small bridge overlooking the fountain plaza . He veered left and started down the stone steps . As I approached the bridge , two police cars sped past on the roadway , their sirens shrieking out of synch . I reached the bridge and started down the steps . Mistake . The shooter was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide stance . Facing me . Aiming the Beretta . Behind him , the wings of the angel in the fountain stretched majestically against the blue sky . I dropped as the gun barked , getting off three shots myself before I hit the steps . One of them took the shooter in the right shoulder , near the collarbone . The Beretta fell to the bricks as the shooter staggered backward . I lunged , knowing the instant I did that it was the wrong thing to do . I was half running , half falling down the steps . Somewhere in the tumbling , I lost my grip on the policeman 's service revolver . Below me , the shooter was hugging his bad arm with his good , taking Frankenstein steps toward his gun . He 'd reach it years before I could . A body went flying past me down the stone steps . It was a cop . Gun drawn and shouting . A second cop grabbed me from behind and stopped my tumbling descent . It was a good strong grip . " Fucking move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . Below me , the other cop reached the wounded shooter . With a nifty sweep of a foot , he brought the shooter to the ground . Ignoring the wounded shoulder , the cop jerked the guy 's hands behind him and cuffed him . I was cuffed , too . I offered no resistance and no explanations . My cop was a tall , fierce-looking black man . His heartbeat was probably nearing two hundred blows a minute . Mine sure as hell was . Way too many engines running way too high . I relaxed into custody . There would be time to talk . The shooter was dragged back up the steps and shoved into the back of a patrol car . My cop was joined by another one , his partner . Squatty guy shaped like a gumdrop . The gumdrop patted me down for weapons , then shoved me into the back of a second patrol car . I was separated from the front seat by a cage . The black guy got behind the wheel . Gumdrop took shotgun . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also surprised me that they did n't take the eastern exit out of the park , or the exit to the south . Either would have taken us away from the parade mess . Instead , the two cars rolled west to Central Park West , where at least a dozen more police cars and several ambulances were already crisscrossing the street , lights whirling . The screaming had ceased . Now it was time for the crying . The crying and the wailing . People hugging people . People staggering in a daze . Faces registering disbelief , horror , shock . Gumdrop muttered , " Jesus goddamn Christ , " as we inched our way forward . The parade was in tatters . Band instruments were strewn all over the place . I spotted the Pink Panther far to the south , near Columbus Circle , hovering precariously above the street . The wind had kicked up , and the huge figure looked like it was being uppity , bucking and shifting against its ropes . As we crossed Central Park West at a walker 's pace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller . A white balloon . The towheaded kid was still clutching the string . As the stretcher bearing the boy 's mother was being slid into the back of an ambulance , one of the EMS workers gathered the boy up into her arms , and the balloon drifted lightly against her face . Ezra , for the last time . . . The little boy released the string . 2 We hit Broadway and went left . I figured I was being taken to the Midtown North station on Fifty-fourth , a five-minute drive , tops , with the cherry spinning and the siren clearing the way . But the accessories remained undeployed , and as we drifted past Fifty-third , I leaned forward in the seat . " Boys . You missed the turn . " The driver said nothing . Gumdrop half turned in his seat . " Shaddup . " The radio crackled , and a female voice spit out a series of numbers and letters . Gumdrop glanced curiously at his partner , who nodded tersely . Gumdrop fished a headset from the glove compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leaned forward to plug it into the radio , which suddenly went silent . I placed both the cops somewhere in their early thirties , which meant I was the senior man in the car . The driver looked up in his mirror and saw that I was still leaning forward . " Sit back . " " Just so you know , " I said , " I 'm the good guy here . " " Sit . Back . " I sat back . We crossed to Ninth Avenue and passed a restaurant called Zen Palate . Margo loves that place . There are three of them in the city , the closest one to her being the one on Broadway in the mid-Seventies . She 's dragged me there a couple times . I like half the stuff I 've tried there with her . The other half tastes like cardboard . Margo.
