It was in July that we began trying to conceive . Initially it was very exciting . We told people , they would congratulate us as though you were on your way over in a cab . There was need for lavish carnal activity , sanctioned by God . Six months went by . Where were you , we wondered , newly humbled . Already you had clout , kept people waiting . There were no guarantees you would show at all : a diva . " We 're trying , " we said . Almost Christmas then , that zing in the air . I met your father in the Presidio for hamburgers and red wine . I recall light confidences , an overall air of gladness , the evening 's hard slant of sun as we walked in . Later we slipped home to our yellow bedroom and you happened . Joe DiMaggio was at the bar at Lil 's that night . I surely do n't consider this a coincidence . On the eighth day of the new year , the line on the home-pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking at it , I felt a crazy glee . Terror , but no real surprise . For days I 'd had a physical sense of you , like someone standing behind me at a party . That night your father came home and instantly ferreted out the test stick from the top of my rolltop desk . He ran upstairs , clutching it like a white plastic flag high above his head , triumphant . I remember that he ran . I remember it was a Thursday . The next day he started worrying about money and being forty-nine and wringing his hands , but that night was pure . Slowly we danced to Andrea Marcovicci , the evidence of you fresh . We went to bed early , clothesand shoes peppered across the floor . We rushed as though to join you . There has been a great deal of stick-urinating on your behalf . The ovulation sticks , which did n't work , and the pregnancy sticks , which did . Now let there be an end to all stick-urinating . The song we danced to was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty-four weeks yet to go , I am thinking as we wind down the mountain and the moss-draped madrone trees lean out to greet us . It is called Madrone Canyon because of the trees ' abundance , beautiful and lithe , growing at times parallel to the ground . They were here before us and will be here when we are gone . We are canyon dwellers , we three . At the bottom of this mountain is a public park , nestled within a very bossy clutch of California redwoods that the road dissects . Its name is Dolliver , but because of the immense shady trees , the locals call it Dark Park . This is not meant to be a negative ; darkness can be soothing . It 's dark where you are now . Dark Park has monkey bars , slides , and the thing that goes around and around that all the mothers are afraid of . There 's a low pebbly creek , and several picnic benches within the seasoned redwood grove . It 's all been arranged . The trees and the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much patience I feel somewhat shamed . Of course , it 's easy to be patient when you 're a tree . Low in my body I feel something I must imagine : a tingling , gritty sensation . On the car stereo , your father plays a song for you . " Please Call Me , Baby , " by Tom Waits . Please call me , baby , wherever you are It 's too cold to be out walkin ' in the streets ... Your father says that you are not a classical baby , you are a blues baby . This is what he looks like , your father : dark brown hair mingled with gray , soft skin that tans easily , silver glasses . Of average height , a primarily kind face with heavily lidded eyes that affect boredom but hoard interest . Women have always liked him . I liked him myself , liked him so much I married him . Watch out for this kind of thing . I will tell you something else about your father . I was worrying about becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't worry about getting big , because every month you are going to get more beautiful . And every month I will love you a little more . " I waited for him before I had you . Or maybe it was you who waited . * * * My best friend , Diana , is pregnant , her due date exactly a month ahead of mine . Be advised that you are in fact part of a diabolical scheme to have our babies at the same time and then go on to rule the world . At the very least we 'll be large and threatening together . People will stand aside on the street when they see us coming , as a matter of practicality if not outright respect . Diana and I met during the first day of junior high school in Oakland , California , in Mr. Cramer 's American history class . Mr. Cramer looked like a hipster Santa Claus with brown hair and horn-rimmed glasses . He eventually ran away with a student , which I guess is as good a lesson in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York , and finally to New Mexico , where she fell in love with her husband , but not before we became best friends and shared a few life-threatening escapades , all of which we now treasure like precious stones . Diana will be your favorite older person . I know this in advance . Diana has red-gold hair , a deep voice , large Slavic features , and perfect skin . She will be the woman standing next to your mother holding drinks , this is how you will know her . Now is Diana 's second pregnancy . Her daughter , Carmen , was born the year your father and I became engaged . Carmen is twice as tall and gorgeous as a three-year-old girl frankly has a right to be . She is whip smart and , if bribed even slightly , will get coffee for us . Last spring Diana and I were on the phone exploring the idea of conception , and I said , " Well , we 've got to have a deadline . " Diana said , " When ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was firm about it , as I recall . I held one arm up high in the air . Diana was already a veteran . This led to many long conversations regarding ovulation and which precise points we were at in our cycles , and did anyone really know anything . We exchanged stories about who had gotten pregnant and on what day in their cycle they had done it . We talked about what days we did it last month and what days we were going to try this month . We did everything but break out the chicken blood and hoodoo sticks . Your father did not join in these debates and was never concerned in the slightest that I would conceive . He had a faith that bordered on Catholicism , a firm belief that I could conceive at any time of any month . I think he genuinely thought it would take only one month , but it did n't . He was philosophical , I was cautiously optimistic . By that time we were having a tot of sex , which in and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off all your clothes in the middle of the day and making a baby . It 's not high on the list of unpleasant things to do . After a few months Diana and I decided to become scientific ; this meant daily personal phone calls from our offices and the use of ovulation sticks , which had worked for two teachers at her school but not for her sister . We would actually put the phone down , take the ovulation test , wash our hands , and come back to the phone to report our findings . Between ovulation analysis , sexual target dates , and general folklore , it was not unusual for us to spend an hour at a stretch on the line . We had the zeal and camaraderie of professional athletes . And we made it . She conceived around November 20 , and I conceived around December 22 . It does n't get much tighter than that . Considering this now , I feel incredibly able . I know it was entirely up to you , the moment you decided to materialize here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . It may be the last time . Months earlier I 'd found a smooth white stone and written the word hope on it in red pencil . I placed it in our front yard , on a large rock next to the rosemary bush . When the first rains knocked the stone down into the dirt , by the roots of the sage bush , I brought it back up onto the rock . I gave it a place in the sun . Every so often now , I check to see if I can still read the word on it . It is still there . * * * I 'm going to tell you about us , so you wo n't feel uninformed later . Ignorance is the backbone of oppression . I work in advertising , as does your father . In the writing profession , advertising is the least work you can do for the most money . It has the benefit of being occasionally fun , all the while possessing the moral center of a Turkish prison . Advertising means drinking espresso and buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then at the last possible second having an idea that involves either the Eiffel Tower or pyramids . It means attending foreign independent films and discerning which unique or especially touching parts you can fashion into a hot-dog commercial . It is long , surreal meetings in which people wearing terribly expensive watches passionately debate the personality of bleach . Advertising is pitching a large television campaign to a middle-aged white man wearing a puka-shell necklace while your partner sits crooked on his chair , wordlessly eating a bag of Cheetos , viciously hung over with one side of his hair sticking straight up . If at any time during your presentation the puka-shell man laughs , then you know you 're going to full production . You 're moving into full production even though you do n't have scripts , because this is the kind of client who gets furious if there are scripts , because then he ca n't write his own campaign during the presentation . Which is what he 's doing now as he says , " Yes . And the older man is helping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , " you say . " Celebrate the product , " he murmurs . " Yessssss ... " you say , coaxing a skittish dog into a car . " I love it , " the Token Lesbian in the Position of High Power says ; and everyone at the table is beaming now , your best friends in the world instead of what they were at the presentation last week , which was hillbillies with guns . Once you are in production , advertising means a forty-year-old commercial director in a porkpie hat who has people bring him chai and talks about the process in hushed church tones . All the while saying no to everything the client asks for , especially if it means showing the product in any way . His wife will visit the set ; she will be ten . Much of this used to matter to me , what campaign got produced , who directed it , the proximity of whatever hotel everyone was currently staying at . Keeping away from the shunned hotels . But now it is fading with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a distance . For the first time in my career , I am not wondering what the next step is . I know what the next step is . Out . I am getting on the baby ship . I am the baby ship . * * * I fell in love with your father with terrible swiftness . Within five minutes I thought , I could marry this man . Not in the sense that he was easy , but in the sense that I could love him that long and hard . I imagined there would be laughter involved . With laughter I felt I could endure marriage . How simple it seemed , how imperative . I was compelled to make a fast decision , as though God were playing blackjack with me for my own happiness , my life . I had to say , Hit me , God . Hit me . It was n't his demeanor that drew me to him . It was evening , he was tired and , I think , despondent . It was n't charm or physical sheen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me behind his eyes in a way he may not have been aware of . And I 've felt basically lucky ever since , almost every day of my life . That 's something else love should make you feel . It should make you feel fortunate . It will be made clear to you in a stray gesture , the line of a throat . Something in the hands . There may or may not be any music playing . But there will be a certain velocity of the spirit , a sensation of dropping through clear space unimpeded , and you think , This is the one . I found you . * * * Today I called a friend to talk about you , and then I realized she was grotesquely unworthy . I never trusted her , she has this very competitive habit of vibe-ing me : if I have a hangnail , she 's got gangrene . If I have cramps , she 's having not just the heaviest period of her life but what she suspects is an early miscarriage . If I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a knife to my eye , she 'll say , " So ? I 've had Mafia hit men holding knives to my eyes all my life . " I 've known this , but it took being pregnant to realize it fully . I can see you 're already this very small and tight Committee , and the Committee will say where we are going and where we are n't . What 's good to eat and what is n't . Finding food that is good to eat has become a troublesome adventure . Almost nothing is as good as it should be , or as good as I remember it . Whereas before I was happy to eat whatever was put in front of me , I ca n't now . It has to pass each newly heightened sense , or most of them . There seem to be electoral votes involved . Twice this week I have ordered take-out pizza , eaten one bite , and thrown the whole thing away . Olives have taken on an insidious presence , as have green bell peppers . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . The Committee decided I was n't going to be smoking anymore . And I thought it was me making that decision , because I did n't even know I was pregnant at that time , though I wanted to be . I stubbed out my last Marlboro Light on New Year 's Eve ; a brave and personal resolution , or so I thought . Now I know that you had just burrowed yourself into my uterus lining and had decided that nicotine was unacceptable . Fin. * * * I am just past eight weeks pregnant . I take hold of my cast-iron skillet , its heft alone enormously satisfying . I melt a nub of butter in the blackness , crack an egg on its hard , capable side ; like most women , I admire a cooking implement that has the ability to maim . It was William Burroughs who said that no one owns life , but anyone with a frying pan owns death . I scramble two jumbos , look at them , and suddenly they do n't look like eggs . They appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead baby chicks : aborted chickens that had no chance to live , to see the world . Gazing into the viscous embryonic pool , I can almost hear their feathery screams . I may also possibly see an eye . Fueled by a rush of zealot hormones , an unnaturally harsh reality is emerging . After cramming the pulverized chicks down the garbage disposal , I lie down in the bedroom as intensely purposeful enzymes race through my body like tiny malicious joyriders . One minute later , your father is lurking in the doorway , bouncing on the balls of his feet , saying he wants to see a matinee . Insisting that I rise and dress , that we leave right away . The smell of the popcorn alone would send me over the edge . As I contemplate this , I advance-sense the fake rancid-butter odor slipping up my nostrils until I almost retch . It 's eleven A.M. and I ca n't get out of my cat-hairy bathrobe . I feel like I drank nine martinis last night aboard a badly driven submarine , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film . He says The New York Times liked it , and to bring a plastic bag in case I need to vomit . The first thing you need to know about humankind is that we are somewhat selfish . Rapacious would not be an overstatement . Once you grasp this simple truth , you hold the key to mankind . If there 's a single space in the lifeboat and you are standing next to anyone but to anyone but Ghandi or your natural parents , expect a struggle . Men in particular are capable of remarkable acts of selfishness performed on a consistent basis over long periods of time . Examples include Napoleon , Adolf Hitler , Donald Trump , and the methodical extinction of almost everything on Earth . Even the best of men , like your father , are centered on themselves in a way most women can only contemplate . Here it is Saturday morning , and I have found a modicum of relief from the harsh nausea and the egg madness by reclining in bed with my laptop and e-mailing Mad Augusten in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming vaguely unlike the fine man I know and perpetually welcome the sight of : now he looks as though he should have a long , low black hat and a poker of some kind . He is saying I never want to go anywhere anymore . He is calling me dull , so I call him inconsiderate . We do n't actually say these things , we imply . Along with extended stretches of contentment and occasional bursts of joy , this is some of what you can anticipate when you grow up and get married . Baby , no one expects it to happen to them . If you are a girl , I do n't think you should necessarily become a lesbian , although if the idea appeals to you , I would n't say anything against it . I would n't try to stop you . Men can be obstinate and difficult to live with . Unlike myself , a perfectly reasonable woman unless shown a bag in which I am to place my vomit . If you are a boy , I apologize . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and the eyes of a serial killer . He lives in Manhattan and has never cooked a meal in his entire life , not even tinned soup . Instead he orders beef vindaloo , Cantonese lobster with ginger sauce , pork rangoon , and something called salad pizza . He pays for it , eats it , and leaves the cartons in his living room , every inch of which is piled with books . He has an eighth-grade education and has sold several books to major publishers ; the first he wrote in two weeks . He once performed oral surgery on himself at three A.M. with a thumbtack and a large Scotch . He dates a man whom he has been seeing for years but is not his boyfriend , because Mad Augusten is too crazy to have a boyfriend . He falls in love with people and destroys them without actually meaning to , an absentminded knife thrower , a blind pilot . He has a single Calphalon stock pot in the middle of his living room because his light fixture leaks when it rains . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " No , " he said . " That 's what disturbs me . " You should have at least one friend like this , possibly more . Life absolutely requires the occasional unhinged artist . * * * Professionally , I am investigating my options . My assistant , K. , is helping me . We are examining the official documents of corporate policy as it relates to years employed and time spent away from the job at full pay . We are cackling and fondling the shiny saddle-stitched corporate rule book and calculating the exact parameters of maternity leave . The timing of my employment and your conception have dovetailed in a bizarre yet fortuitous way : by accident , your mother has recently become a five-year veteran of the agency . I am also a vice president . There are hundreds of vice presidents here ; however , I am one of the few with ovaries . Full of furtive purpose , K. and I consult the calendar like astrologers . We make decisions based on fact and instinct . We cross-reference with major and minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of returning to work after the birth is intriguing . My reentry plan is simple thus far . I will take paid leave and unpaid leave until the people from personnel come after me with torches . Because of the extraordinary nature of you , I do n't care who gets my office . I know someone will get my office , and I do n't care . This is how much you signify . You are what the account planners would call a tribe leader . Your father telephones from across town . Today at your father 's agency , advertising involves a talking toilet that discusses its role in society with its friend the sink . A talking toilet : the bottom lip is the seat , the upper lip is the lid . The sink complains because people spit toothpaste out on him . " Do n't get me started , " says the toilet . I ask your father how it happened that one gets assigned to work on toilet products . He himself is on barbecue sauce . " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written some pretty good dialogue between the sink and the toilet . " * * * I spoke with Diana today to see how her moving day from Albuquerque went , and she said that she christened her new house in Oregon by puking Thai food into the recycling bucket . I myself was so nauseated last night I lay awake for two hours , trying not to be sick . I won , too . Instead of concentrating on the waves of sickness , I thought of blue sky . Remember this . Earlier , I had watched The Exorcist on television , which was probably spectacularly unhelpful because of the projectile-vomiting scenes . Yet I could n't help watching , due to those quick , subliminal frame manipulations where the director slips in the demon face . The movie is structured so that everything is going along as usual , when suddenly you see a white-faced red-mouthed demon screaming , and then the scene reverts to normal . It 's a neat little frill that I think made some epileptics have grand mal seizures . I saw that movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched her wrist until it was raw . When the demon face happened , we screamed . Twenty-two years later , we both married for the first time . We go through everything together . This makes us the luckiest women alive . * * * This afternoon was my first visit to the OB-GYN . Her name is Dr. Gray and she looks like Florence Henderson , which seems right . We sat in her mauve office , and she asked me a lot of questions about how many cats did we have and is anybody Jewish . I answered everything in a stupor and stared at the framed scalpel on her wall . I wanted to ask her about it , but guessed I should save something for later . Just so we keep the mystery going . She asked me about any other pregnancies before you , and I said , " One . " " Any complications with the abortion ? " she asked . I looked at her and smiled , thinking , What planet are you from ? There was the smallest of pauses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . This does not count as a complication . The good news is , she informed me that since I 'm tall , I am entitled to gain thirty-five pounds . I do n't believe I actually will gain much weight , but I decide to go along with her for now . I will pretend , for her sake and for the free vitamin samples . Then I sat naked in the examining room for twenty minutes , with a blue paper sheet draped across my public-property body . I read a People article about a television-sitcom actress and how crazy in love she is with this other actor , and how she has a face-sucking oxygen machine that makes her look younger , and how she wants to lose twenty pounds . The media is deeply concerned about her weight , but she seems to be happy nonetheless , although you never know . You really ca n't tell how people are doing from magazine interviews . Sitcom Actress says she fasts and that she loves to fast , that it gives her enormous clarity . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe that 's why I do n't get to be on the cover of People or have any clarity . But still , if she 's fasting , then maybe they 're going to find out that fasting backfires , judging from the recent shot of her in a Hawaiian muumuu on the cover of The National Enquirer . Any cover is a good cover , though . That 's another truism . Finally the doctor came in and told me to slide down the table and put my feet in the stirrups . I did what she asked . If she had said , Okay , now bark like a dog , I would have . I 'd known her forty minutes and she already had my absolute trust because she has delivered twelve healthy babies to women I personally know , one of whom was forty-six . This puts Dr. Lorraine Gray right above Moses and just below Picasso in my book . Then she said , " You 're due September fourteenth . Everything should be fine . " And I just thought , Huh . How she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute is a David Copperfield kind of fact , and I was not going to probe further . I take my manna where I find it . When I walked outside , the January sun was shining . This seemed meaningful , I took this also . If you ever want a baby , make love every other day . That is how you happened . You were planned , tried for , summoned . You are the closest I will ever come to magic . ( Continues ... )
