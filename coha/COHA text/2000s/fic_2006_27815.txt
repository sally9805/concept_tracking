Prologue Whom the Gods love die young .  - -  - Polish proverb Poland 1794 2 November All Souls ' Day Swollen with recent rains , the river heaved and churned , flowing rapidly away from Warsaw , its burden of bodies propelled carelessly along , like so much flotsam . A partially clad woman clung to something as the current took her . A log ? A piece of planking from the broken bridge ? Delirious from the fall , she was certain she was dying -- or had died . Her faith -- or the hazy filaments of a childhood belief that she conjured now -- suggested she might expect to ascend into heaven as if on wings . Or plummet to a hell she had thought little about . But she was being carried in an undulating line -- like a weightless twig -- through the drumming rush of water . The sparkling interplay of the afternoon sunshine on the water was deceiving , for the river was brutally cold . The woman 's mind inexplicably fastened on to the mythical river that was thought to usher one to theGreek underworld . Her cousin had told her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open her eyes . What was she to expect in the underworld ? There would be the fee for the ferry boat operator . Did she have any coins ? She thought not , and without a coin he would not bring her across . Everyone knew that . Might she use her charms on him ? Were charms of her kind taken as legal tender in the underworld ? She had her doubts . Her heart felt the icy fingers of the river upon it . How was she to account for her life ? The things she had done ? The numbing water seemed to run faster now -- like her fear -- rushing her to her fate . The ancient Poles had believed that those who died by drowning were doomed to become water spirits , forever residing in the waters where they had met death . She imagined Marzanna , Goddess Death , waiting for her at the river 's end , dressed in white and carrying her scythe . The woman pushed the Polish deity from her mind . At the age of twenty , she had run out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often proclaimed that the years of her youth were ducats to be spent . Wishing she had lived a better life was useless . Just as well , she thought -- she had never been one for apologies . Or regrets . She was cold , cold to the bone . She took in a mouthful of water and coughed . Despite the urge , she knew not to move a hand to her face . To do so would cause her to lose her grip , and the river would draw her to its bottom . Her arms and hands were frozen in position , locked on to the object they were holding . . . holding . And if God was the Christian God of her parents ' beliefs , she wondered , would he forgive her ? With the numbing cold , she felt darkness descending -- and the angry resignation that death was imminent . It was as certain as the fall of night 's curtain . . . . Dog 's blood ! How had she come to such an ignominious end ? * * * The villagers who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cargo the River Vistula was carrying past them . Those transfixed with wide eyes were mostly women , their men having gone off to fight with Kosciuszko against the invading forces . An old man gawked much like the others -- in silence -- as the flotilla of human bodies moved steadily along . Sometimes a corpse became enmeshed in the weeds and foliage at the bank of the river , but the force of other bodies following a similar fateful journey goaded it once again on its way -- or the water 's strong current drew it down toward the murky bottom . In disbelief , the old man turned toward Warsaw ; the city was a great distance away , twenty miles upriver , but he could see an eerie , orange glow and above that , thick black smoke rising high into the air . Had the capital fallen to the Russians ? God help us all , he prayed . Then aloud : " God and the Black Madonna ! " The man 's grandson had braved the sight , going close to the shore . The old man called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even one already wounded in the patriots ' cause . The boy seemed not to hear . " Jerzy , come back ! " he called again . His grandson turned , a queer look on his face , and waved him forward . Without questioning , the old man obeyed . When he came to the shore , his eyes widened at the sight that held Jerzy spellbound . A raven-haired woman clung to what looked like planking that had become caught in the thick reeds and tubers at the river 's side . Her skirt was red as blood , and she was naked above the waist . She was both young and beautiful , . . . Something about her told him she must certainly be noble . The old man saw now what Jerzy had seen . Little bubbles at her mouth . Damn ! The woman was gasping for breath . She was alive ! The peasant understood what his grandson meant to do and moved closer to assist . Jerzy immediately stepped into the water , reaching for the woman with one arm while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bank . Jerzy tugged at one of the woman 's arms , trying to force her to let go of what had held her afloat . Her skin was nearly blue . " Let go ! Let go ! " he cried . She remained insensible to his directions . The mouth seemed to twist and tighten . Her clawlike hands held fast . The current spun her body now , pulling her , whipping her legs and lower body out toward the river 's middle , as if the river had mighty hands that would not allow her to be rescued . Jerzy held on , persisting in loosening her grip , pulling back one finger , then another . At last her hand came free and came to clasp his as he pulled her to him . Her other hand willingly released that which had held her afloat the long distance from Warsaw , and as the old man aided his grandson in pulling the woman to safety , he saw that she had set free the red uniformed body of a Russian soldier , its mustachioed face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
