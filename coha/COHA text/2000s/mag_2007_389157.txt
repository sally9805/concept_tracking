Headnote Will embryonic stem cell promise ever pay off ? IF YOU OR A LOVED ONE IS CURRENTLY ILL or planning to be so in the near future , do n't bother looking to embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) research to help . Instead , you need to consult the adult stem cell ( ASC ) literature whereupon you 'll find these little guys currently treat or cure over 70 diseases and conditions even as they 're involved in almost 1,300 human clinical trials . At this point , all that ESCs hold is promise . They are used in no treatments , cures , or human clinical trials . They are used in raising false hopes and hence money . The University of California , Irvine 's Hans Keirstead , who claims to have used ESCs to cure paralyzed rats , said last year he would start human clinical trials this year . Problem is , he 's been saying " next year " since 2002 . Check your calendar . Moreover-and this is typical of ESC researcher grandstanding-his rats were n't even paralyzed . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Ed Bradley on 60 Minutes , the injuries were " moderate in severity and sparing some hind limb motor function , " as he reported in a medical journal . ESC lobbyists sniff that ASC research got a big head start . " Researchers began using adult stem cells frombone marrow back in 1960 , " claims ReligiousTolerance.org on its website . ( Note that the very name furthers the ESC lobby 's goal of portraying all their opponents as religious fanatics . ) " It was only in 1998 that other researchers were able to isolate and cultivate embryo stem cells . Adult stem cell research thus has an almost four decade head start compared to embryo-derived stem cells . " In fact , ASCs and ESCs were both discovered in rodents in the 1950s . But the ASCs-from marrow-were readily adaptable for treating leukemia and other human blood disorders . ESCs , conversely , precisely because of their much-touted flexibility , were so hard to work with that it was n't until 1998 , in the lab of the University of Wisconsin 's James Thomson , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain a real bear to work with , which is why their domain remains primarily the Petri dish . What is the ESC promise and when will these cells and scientists deliver ? SINCE THEY ARE mere days old , ESCs are so malleable as to lend themselves to becoming mature cells from all three germ layers of the human body-about 220 types of cells total . ASCs , because they are more developed , were long thought to be considerably less flexible . That is , you could get marrow from marrow stem cells along with blood , muscle , and an amazing array of other types of mature cells . But you could n't get neurons or pancreatic cells because those are in different germ layers . Two developments , however , have eaten away at this apparent ESC advantage . The first is that while ASCs were originally identified in marrow , now they 've been found throughout the body including skin , brains , spinal cords , dental pulp , muscles , blood vessels , corneas , retinas , livers , hair follicles , and umbilical cords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem cells that have been converted into more fat ( for cosmetic purposes ) , bone , cartilage , and nerve cells . Importantly , nerve cells are in a different germ layer from fat . With numerous types of stem cells in all three germ layers , if s possible we could constitute all 220 cell types ( assuming you even need all 220 cell types ) without a one-size-fits-all ES cell . The second development is that since 2002 researchers have been discovering ASCs that apparently can be converted to mature cells in all three germ layers , beginning with the University of Minnesota Stem Cell Institute Catherine Verfaillie 's finding , announced in Nature magazine . Others have since used different types of cells from those Verfaillie used , but to the same effect . THE MOST EXCITING NEWS in this area lately has been the revelation , announced in January , of Anthony Atala 's findings . Atala , a physician and director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine , found that stem cells in the amniotic fluid that fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versatile as ESCs . As he told PBS 's NewsHour . " We have been able to drive the cell to what we call all three germ layers , which basically means all three major classes of tissues available in the body , from which all cells come from . " One advantage of ESCs has been that while most types of adult stem cells can not be multiplied outside of the body for very long , embryonic ones may replicate in the lab indefinitely . But Atala 's amniotic stem cells grow as fast outside the body as ESCs ( doubling every 36 hours ) , and he 's now been growing the same cell line for two years with no indication of slowing . ESC researchers have desperately tried to downplay these findings , to the extent that the New York Times , which told readers three years ago that there were no cures or treatments involving ASCs , refused even to mention Atala 's work Newsweek International did make note of it but claimed , " Many scientists are quick to emphasize that comprehensive human trials are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if " years away " means " years ago . " As Atala himself has noted , amniotic stem cells are identical to placental stem cells . The New England Journal of Medicine carried one paper on aplacenta stem cell trial back in 1996 and another paper two years later . There 's been an ongoing clinical trial since 2001 to treat sickle cell anemia . Backers of more funding for ESC research are also quick to point out that Atala himself , after his article was published , wrote in a letter ; " It is essential that National Institutes of Health-funded researchers are able to fully pursue embryonic stem cell research . " But as I observed two years ago , ASC researchers almost always say something like that after making a breakthrough . NIH is the hand that feeds them and NIH likes handing checks to ESC researchers . There 's also nothing to be gained by angering colleagues whose livelihoods are based on tinkering with ESCs , if not actually accomplishing anything . ESCs certainly had a head start in the race to develop all types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either been rapidly narrowed or even erased . Meanwhile the ASC advantage in therapies grows by the month . WHICH LEAVES US WITH A FINAL but very important question . When will the ESC promise pay off ? When can we expect something more from them than arcane articles in medical journals ( though repeatedly portrayed as miracle breakthroughs in the New York Times ) ? You know , like , well , actually making sick people better ? The standard answer is in about a decade , which must be true because if s been " in about a decade " for years now . Yes , widen , lengthen , and deepen that federal trough enough and toss in lots of state funding from places like California ( 3 billion bucks over ten years ) , and we just might be able to do with an ESC in 2017 what we can with an ASC today . But one leading ESC scientist says even that maybe far too optimistic . That scientist is none other than the University of Wisconsin 's James Thomson himself . In addressing a convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESC research are daunting . Among them is that ES cells require the recipient to permanently use dangerous immunosuppressive drugs and that they have a nasty tendency to form into teratomas-which means " monster tumor . " Said Thomson , " I do n't want to sound too pessimistic because this is all doable , but ifs going to be very hard . " Further , " Ifs likely to take a longtime . " How long ? The Associated Press writer present characterized it as " likely decades away . " Thaf s a minimum of 20 years , with no maximum . As to what we can expect from those therapies , as the AP writer quoting Thomson put it : " One day , some believe the embryonic stem cells will become sources of brain tissue , muscle and bone marrow to replace diseased or injured body parts . " In other words , they 'll be able to do what ASCs do right now . Muscle ? In the last few years , doctors have used ASCs to rebuild hearts and livers not in Petri dishes but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem cells have been curing people for half a century . Finally , neuronal stem cells have treated brain diseases like Parkinsonism in animal models and assuredly will soon enter human testing . Not soon enough , to be sure , but certainly a lot earlier than " decades . " Autopsies onbone marrow recipients have found that some of the cells made their way to the brain and became nerve cells . Whether this was actually therapeutic remains unknown . So let " s just give the ESC researchers all the money they want for their decades-away promise , mindful that those funds could have gone to ASC research projects treating and curing humans today . Then perhaps they 'll announce that , given enough money and perhaps decades , they 'll also build a computer with the processing power of adime-store calculator .
