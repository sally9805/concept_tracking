Nicholas Sayre and the Creature in the Case " I am going back to the Old Kingdom , Uncle , " said Nicholas Sayre . " Whatever Father may have told you . So there is no point in your trying to fix me up with a suitable Sayre job or a suitable Sayre marriage . I am coming with you to what will undoubtedly be a horrendous house party only because it will get me a few hundred miles closer to the Wall . " Nicholas 's uncle Edward , more generally known as The Most Honorable Edward Sayre , Chief Minister of Ancelstierre , shut the red-bound letter book he was reading with more emphasis than he intended , as their heavily armored car lurched over a hump in the road . The sudden clap of the book made the bodyguard in front look around , but the driver kept his eyes on the narrow country lane . " Have I said anything about a job or a marriage ? " Edward enquired , gazing down his long , patrician nose at his nineteen-year-old nephew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile of the Perimeter without a pass signed by me , let alone across the Wall . " " I could get a pass from Lewis , " said Nicholas moodily , referring to the newly anointed Hereditary Arbiter . The previous Arbiter , Lewis 's grandfather , haddied of a heart attack during Corolini 's attempted coup d'etat half a year before . " No , you could n't , and you know it , " said Edward . " Lewis has more sense than to involve himself in any aspect of government other than the ceremonial . " " Then I 'll have to cross over without a pass , " declared Nicholas angrily , not even trying to hide the frustration that had built up in him over the past six months , during which he 'd been forced to stay in Ancelstierre . Most of that time spent wishing he 'd left with Lirael and Sam in the immediate aftermath of the Destroyer 's defeat , instead of deciding to recuperate in Ancelstierre . It had been weakness and fear that had driven his decision , combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he now knew that was impossible . He could not ignore the legacy of his involvement with Hedge and the Destroyer , nor his return to Life at the hands  --  or paws  --  of the Disreputable Dog . He had become someone else , and he could only find out who that was in the Old Kingdom . " You would almost certainly be shot if you try to cross illegally , " said Edward . " A fate you would richly deserve . Particularly since you are not giving me the opportunity to help you . I do not know why you or anyone else would want to go to the Old Kingdom  --  my year on the Perimeter as General Hort 's ADC certainly taught me the place is best avoided . Nor do I wish to annoy your father and hurt your mother , but there are certain circumstances in which I might grant you permission to cross the Perimeter . " " What ! Really ? " " Yes , really . Have I ever taken you or any other of my nephews or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I know  --  " " Do I usually make a habit of attending parties given by someone like Alastor Dorrance in the middle of nowhere ? " " I suppose not . . . . " " Then you might exercise your intelligence to wonder why you are here with me now . " " Gatehouse ahead , sir , " interrupted the bodyguard as the car rounded a sweeping corner and slowed down . " Recognition signal is correct . " Edward and Nicholas leaned forward to look through the open partition and the windscreen beyond . A few hundred yards in front , a squat stone gatehouse lurked just off the road , with its two wooden gates swung back . Two slate-gray Heddon-Hare roadsters were parked , one on either side of the gate , with several mackintosh-clad , weapon-toting men standing around them . One of the men waved a yellow flag in a series of complicated movements that Edward clearly understood and Nicholas presumed meant all was well . " Proceed ! " snapped the Chief Minister . Their car slowed more , the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mackintosh-clad men saluted as the car swung off the road and through the gate , dropping their salute as the rest of the motorcade followed . Six motorcycle policemen were immediately behind , then another two cars identical to the one that carried Nicholas and his uncle , then another half dozen police motorcyclists , and finally four trucks that were carrying a company of fully armed soldiery . Corolini 's attempted putsch had failed , and there had surprisingly been no further trouble from the Our Country Party since , but the government continued to be nervous about the safety of the nation 's Chief Minister . " So , what is going on ? " asked Nicholas . " Why are you here ? And why am I here ? Is there something you want me to do ? " " At last , a glimmer of thought . Have you ever wondered what Alastor Dorrance actually does , other than come to Corvere three or four times a year and exercise his eccentricities in public ? " " Is n't that enough ? " asked Nick with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Dorrance had been in the city , only a few weeks before . He 'd hosted a picnic on Holyoak Hill for every apprentice in Corvere and supplied them with fatty roast beef , copious amounts of beer , and a particularly cheap and nasty red wine , with predictable results . " Dorrance 's eccentricities are all show , " said Edward . " Misdirection . He is in fact the head of Department Thirteen . Dorrance Hall is the Department 's main research facility . " " But Department Thirteen is just a made-up thing , for the moving pictures . It does n't really exist . . . um . . . does it ? " " Officially , no . In actuality , yes . Every state has need of spies . Department Thirteen trains and manages ours , and carries out various tasks ill suited to the more regular branches of government . It is watched over quite carefully , I assure you . " " But what has that got to do with me ? " " Department Thirteen observes all our neighbors very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important within those countries . With one notable exception . The Old Kingdom ... Continues ...
