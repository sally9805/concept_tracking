David Webb , professor of linguistics at Georgetown University , was buried beneath a stack of ungraded term papers . He was striding down the musty back corridors of gargantuan Healy Hall , heading for the office of Theodore Barton , his department head , and he was late , hence this shortcut he had long ago discovered using narrow , ill-lighted passageways few students knew about or cared to use . There was a benign ebb and flow to his life bound by the strictures of the university . His year was defined by the terms of the Georgetown semesters . The deep winter that began them gave grudging way to a tentative spring and ended in the heat and humidity of the second semester 's finals week . There was a part of him that fought against serenity , the part that thought of his former life in the clandestine service of the U.S. government , the part that kept him friends with his former handler , Alexander Conklin . He was about to round a corner when he heard harsh voices raised and mocking laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muthfucka , we gon na make your gook tongue come out the back of your head ! " Bourne dropped the stack of papers he had been carrying and sprinted around the corner . As he did so , he saw three young black men in coats down to their ankles arrayed in a menacing semicircle around an Asian , trapping him against a corridor wall . They had a way of standing , their knees slightly bent , their upper limbs loose and swinging slightly that made their entire bodies seem like blunt and ugly aspects of weapons , cocked and ready . With a start , he recognized their prey was Rongsey Siv , a favorite student ofhis . " Muthafucka , " snarled one , wiry , with a strung-out , reckless look on his defiant face , " we come in here , gather up the goods to trade for the bling-bling . " " Ca n't ever have enough bling-bling , " said another with an eagle tattoo on his cheek . He rolled a huge gold square-cut ring , one of many on the fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or do n't you know the bling-bling , gook ? " " Yah , gook , " the strung-out one said , goggle-eyed . " You do n't look like you know shit . " " He wants to stop us , " the one with the tattooed cheek said , leaning in toward Rongsey . " Yah , gook , whatcha gon na do , kung-fuckin-fu us to death ? " They laughed raucously , making stylized kicking gestures toward Rongsey , who shrank back even farther against the wall as they closed in . The third black man , thick-muscled , heavyset , drew a baseball bat from underneath the voluminous folds of his long coat . " That right . Put your hands up , gook . We gon na break your knuckles good . " He slapped the bat against his cupped palm . " You want it all at once or one at a time ? " " Yo , " the strung-out one cried , " he do n't get to choose . " He pulled out his own baseball bat and advanced menacingly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Webb came at them . So silent was his approach , so intent were they on the damage they were about to inflict that they did not become aware of him until he was upon them . He grabbed the strung-out kid 's bat in his left hand as it was coming down toward Rongsey 's head . Tattoo-cheek , on Webb 's right , cursed mightily , swung his balled fist , knuckles bristling with sharp-edged rings , aiming for Webb 's ribs . In that instant , from the veiled and shadowed place inside Webb 's head the Bourne persona took firm control . Webb deflected the blow from tattoo-cheek with his biceps , stepped forward and slammed his elbow into tattoo-cheek 's sternum . He went down , clawing at his chest . The third thug , bigger than the other two , cursed and , dropping his bat , pulled a switchblade . He lunged at Webb , who stepped into the attack , delivering a short , sharp blow to the inside of the assailant 's wrist . The switchblade fell to the corridor floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other 's ankle and lifted up . The big thug fell on his back , turned over and scrambled away . Bourne yanked the baseball bat out of the strung-out thug 's grip . " Muthafuckin ' Five-O , " the thug muttered . His pupils were dilated , unfocused by the effects of whatever drugs he 'd taken . He pulled a gun -- -a cheap Saturday-night special -- -and aimed it at Webb . With deadly accuracy , Webb flung the bat , striking the strung-out thug between the eyes . He staggered back , crying out , and his gun went flying . Alerted by the noise of the struggle , a pair of campus security guards appeared , rounding the corner at a run . They brushed past Webb , pounding after the thugs , who fled without a backward glance , the two helping the strung-out one . They burst through the rear door to the building , out into the bright sunshine of the afternoon , with the guards hot on their heels . Despite the guards ' intervention , Webb felt Bourne 's desire to pursue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen from its psychic sleep , how easily it had gained control of him . Was it because he wanted it to ? Webb took a deep breath , gained a semblance of control and turned to face Rongsey Siv . " Professor Webb ! " Rongsey tried to clear his throat . " I do n't know -- - " He seemed abruptly overcome . His large black eyes were wide behind the lenses of his glasses . His expression was , as usual , impassive , but in those eyes Webb could see all the fear in the world . " It 's okay now . " Webb put his arm across Rongsey 's shoulders . As always , his fondness for the Cambodian refugee was showing through his professorial reserve . He could n't help it . Rongsey had overcome great adversity -- -losing almost all his family in the war . Rongsey and Webb had been in the same Southeast Asian jungles , and try as he might , Webb could not fully remove himself from the tangle of that hot , humid world . Like a recurring fever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recognition , like a dream one has while awake . " Loak soksapbaee chea tay ? " How are you ? he asked in Khmer . " I 'm fine , Professor , " Rongsey replied in the same language . " But I do n't ... I mean , how did you ... ? " " Why do n't we go outside ? " Webb suggested . He was now quite late for Barton 's meeting , but he could n't care less . He picked up the switchblade and the gun . As he checked the gun 's mechanism , the firing pin broke . He threw the useless gun in a trash bin but pocketed the switchblade . Around the corner , Rongsey helped him with the spill of term papers . They then walked in silence through the corridors , which became increasingly crowded as they neared the front of the building . Webb recognized the special nature of this silence , the dense weight of time returning to normal after an incident of shared violence . It was a wartime thing , a consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this teeming metropolitan campus . Emerging from the corridor , they joined the swarm of students crowding through the front doors to Healy Hall . Just inside , in the center of the floor , gleamed the hallowed Georgetown University seal . A great majority of the students were walking around it because a school legend held that if you walked on the seal you 'd never graduate . Rongsey was one of those who gave the seal a wide berth , but Webb strode right across it with no qualms whatsoever . Outside , they stood in the buttery spring sunlight , facing the trees and the Old Quadrangle , breathing the air with its hint of budding flowers . At their backs rose the looming presence of Healy Hall with its imposing Georgian red-brick facade , nineteenth-century dormer windows , slate roof and central two-hundred-foot clock spire . The Cambodian turned to Webb . " Professor , thank you . If you had n't come .... " " Rongsey , " Webb said gently , " do you want to talk about it ? " The student 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? " " I suppose that would depend on you . " Rongsey shrugged . " I 'll be fine , Professor Webb . Really . This is n't the first time I 've been called names . " Webb stood looking at Rongsey for a moment , and he was swept by sudden emotion that caused his eyes to sting . He wanted to take the boy in his arms , hold him close , promise him that nothing else bad would ever happen to him . But he knew that Rongsey 's Buddhist training would not allow him to accept the gesture . Who could say what was going on beneath that fortress like exterior . Webb had seen many others like Rongsey , forced by the exigencies of war and cultural hatred to bear witness to death , the collapse of a civilization , the kinds of tragedies most Americans could not understand . He felt a powerful kinship with Rongsey , an emotional bond that was tinged with a terrible sadness , recognition of the wound inside him that could never truly be healed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never articulated . With a small , almost sad smile , Rongsey formally thanked Webb again and they said their good-byes . Webb stood alone amid the students and faculty hurrying by , and yet he knew that he was n't truly alone . Despite his best efforts , the aggressive personality of Jason Bourne had once again asserted itself . He breathed slowly and deeply , concentrating hard , using the mental techniques his psychiatrist friend , Mo Panov , had taught him for pushing the Bourne identity down . He concentrated first on his surrounding , on the blue and gold colors of the spring afternoon , on the gray stone and red brick of the buildings around the quad , of the movement of the students , the smiling faces of the girls , the laughter of the boys , the earnest talk of the professors . He absorbed each element in its entirety , grounding himself in time and place . Then , and only then , did he turn his thoughts inward . Years ago he had been working for the foreign service in Phnom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie , his current wife , but to a Thai woman named Dao . They had two children , Joshua and Alyssa , and lived in a house on the bank of the river . America was at war with North Vietnam , but the war had spilled over into Cambodia . One afternoon , while he was at work and his family had been swimming in the river , a plane had strafed them , killing them . Webb had almost gone mad with grief . Finally , fleeing his house and Phnom Penh , he 'd arrived in Saigon , a man with no past and no future . It had been Alex Conklin who had taken a heartsick , half-mad David Webb off the streets of Saigon and forged him into a first-rate clandestine operative . In Saigon , Webb had learned to kill , had turned his own self-hatred outward , inflicting his rage on others . When a member of Conklin 's group -- -an evil- tempered drifter named Jason Bourne -- -had been discovered to be a spy , it was Webb who had executed him . Webb had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that it had often been his lifeline . Jason Bourne had saved Webb 's life more times than he could remember . An amusing thought if it had n't been so literal . Years later , when they had both returned to Washington , Conklin had given him a long-term assignment . He had become what amounted to a sleeper agent , taking the name of Jason Bourne , a man long dead , forgotten by everyone . For three years Webb was Bourne , turned himself into an international assassin of great repute in order to hunt down an elusive terrorist . But in Marseilles , his mission had gone terribly wrong . He 'd been shot , cast into the dark waters of the Mediterranean , thought dead . Instead , he had been pulled from the water by members of a fishing boat , nursed back to health by a drunkard doctor in the port they 'd set him down in . The only problem was that in the shock of almost dying he 'd lost his memory . What had come slowly back were the Bourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of Marie , his wife-to-be , that he had come to realize the truth , that he was David Webb . But by that time the Jason Bourne personality was too well ingrained , too powerful , too cunning to die . In the aftermath , he 'd become two people : David Webb , linguistics professor with a new wife and , eventually , two children , and Jason Bourne , the agent trained by Alex Conklin to be a formidable spy . Occasionally , in some crisis , Conklin called on Bourne 's expertise and Webb reluctantly rose to duty . But the truth was that Webb often had little control over his Bourne personality . What had just happened with Rongsey and the three street thugs was evidence enough . Bourne had a way of asserting himself that was beyond Webb 's control , despite all the work he and Panov had done . Khan , having watched David Webb and the Cambodian student talking from across the quad , ducked into a building diagonally across from Healy Hall , mounted the stairs to the third floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked younger than his twenty-seven years and no one gave him a second look . He was wearing khakis and a jeans jacket , over which was slung an outsize backpack . His sneakers made no sound as he went down the hallway , past the doors to classrooms . In his mind 's eye was a clear picture of the view across the quad . He was again calculating angles , taking into account the mature trees that might obscure his view of his intended target . He paused in front of the sixth door , heard a professor 's voice from inside . The talk about ethics brought an ironic smile to his face . In his experience -- -and it was great and varied -- -ethics was as dead and useless as Latin . He went on to the next classroom , which he had already determined was empty , and went in . Quickly now , he shut and locked the door behind him , crossed to the line of windows overlooking the quad , opened one , and got to work . From his backpack , he removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He fitted the optical sight onto it , leaned it on the sill . Peering through the sight , he found David Webb , by this time standing alone across the quad in front of Healy Hall . There were trees just to his left . Every once in a while , a passing student would obscure him . Khan took a deep breath , let it out slowly . He sighted on Webb 's head .
