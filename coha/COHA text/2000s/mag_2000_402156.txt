Section : SPECIAL SECTION CAR PREVIEW Family cars <p> Some of the biggest news in this category will be the completely redesigned Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus , available as sedans , coupes , and - in the case of the Sebring - a convertible . Both nameplates share the same platform and are longer , a bit taller , and roomier than their predecessors . While the Sebring name was previously used one coupe and convertible models , the 2001 sedan replaces the discontinued Cirrus in Chrysler 's lineup . Although the coupes use the same names , these sportier two-door versions are based on the Mitsubishi Eclipse rather than their four-door brethren . <p> Oldsmobile 's top-of-the-line Aurora has also been redesigned to include new styling and interior , a slightly smaller body , and a choice of a V8 or V6 engine ( look for a full test in an upcoming issue ) . For those on more of a budget , Hyundai 's XG300 slots in as the company 's new flagship model ; it offers a V6 and a five-speed auto/manual transmission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been redesigned , growing slightly longer and wider . It 'll be offered as a sedan and coupe , but the hatchback version wo n't be available . From Korea comes a redesigned Hyundai Elantra sedan , as well as the Kia Rio , just launched in August . With a small 95-inch wheelbase , modest 96-hp , 1.5-liter engine , and base price of $8,595 , the Rio is the least expensive new car available in the U.S. Luxury cars <p> Lexus ' flagship model has changed designation from LS400 to LS430 . This reflects the sedan 's larger 4.3-liter V8 , which will be shared with the upcoming GS430 and SC430 , due next spring . Lexus weighs in with the performance-oriented IS300 , intended as a competitor for the BMW 3-Series . Infiniti , meanwhile , will offer a remake of its top-of-the-line Q45 , due at mid-year . <p> For those looking for luxury at a more accessible price , the redesigned Mercedes-Benz C-Class bears a clear family resemblance to the top-line S-Class , and consists of a 168-hp C240 and a 215-hp C320 . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , two new inline-six engines in BMW 's 3-Series lineup mean an across-the-board revamping of BMW 's model designations . Current " 323 " models will be replaced by the " 325 " label , while " 328 " models have been changed to the " 330 " designation . Aiming for a younger audience , Volvo 's new entry is the S60 , a sleeker sedan version of the new V70 wagon . Minivans and wagons <p> Do the crown jewels still shine ? That 's the question facing DaimlerChrysler as it rolls out the latest incarnation of its minivan line , which has dominated the segment in sales since 1984 . With the Plymouth division being phased out , the new lineup consists of the short-wheelbase Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Caravan models , and longer Chrysler Town &; Country and Dodge Grand Caravan . There is a different array of engine options , a power-operated tailgate , dual power sliding doors , and three-zone automatic climate control . Still , the lack of a fold-away third-row bench ( as in the popular Honda Odyssey and Mazda 's MPV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In addition to the SUV wagons mentioned , Audi will introduce its S4 Avant sportwagon powered by a 250-hp turbo V6 , while Volvo 's redesigned V70 continues the Swedish automaker 's popular line of conventional wagons . In addition , Subaru will offer a six-cylinder version of its Outback wagon . Mainstream SUVs <p> Ford hopes its all-new 2002 Explorer , due out early in 2001 , can retain its position as the best-selling SUV . New features include independent rear suspension to replace the rudimentary leaf springs of current models , optional third-row seating , an optional 4.6-liter V8 , side curtain-type airbags , electronic stability control , and a new rollover protection system . Mercury will continue to market its own version of the Explorer in its Mountaineer model . Mitsubishi 's redesigned Montero , meanwhile , seats seven and has a third seat that folds into the floor . <p> Despite recent hikes in gasoline prices , full-size SUVs also continue to proliferate . Toyota 's Sequoia is sized and styled to compete with the Ford Expedition and Chevrolet Tahoe . It relies on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , like its competitors , features a third-row bench seat . <p> Coming in early 2001 is a reworking of Cadillac 's full-size Escalade ( basically a gussied-up Tahoe ) , with a 345-hp , 6.0-liter V8 , and electronic ride-damping and level control . GMC also has two new upscale Denali models on tap for its Yukon and Yukon XL lines that will use the same V8 . Green cars <p> As the first hybrid-electric vehicle ( HEV ) to appear in the U.S. , the 2000 Honda Insight marked a turning point in the auto industry 's efforts to merge the benefits of electric power with everyday driving demands . In contrast to dedicated electric vehicles run solely on batteries , HEVs do n't need to be recharged from an external source ; they also have a driving range that 's not limited by battery charge . <p> This year , Toyota released its long-awaited Prius , which has been on sale in Japan for more than two years . Both models couple a small internal-combustion engine with an electric motor . Unlike the Insight , which uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gas engine , the Prius will automatically switch between electric , gas , and combined modes as driving needs change . ( Look for a full test on both the Insight and Prius in an upcoming issue of Consumer Reports . ) Other dual-powertrain vehicles in the offing include the 2003 For Escape HEV . <p> Volvo claims it 's cleaning up the air around the car with its new PremAir radiator , used in all of its 2001 models . This radiator is coated with a new catalytic material that 's designed to break down smog-causing ozone present in our ambient atmosphere , simply by having outside air pass through the radiator at the front of the car . Sporty cars <p> One of the most anticipated cars for the coming year is the reborn , retrostyled Ford Thunderbird convertible , which will debut next summer . Other new convertible choices include the Audi TT Roadster , BMW 3-Series convertible , a more powerful Mazda Miata , the V6-powered Mercedes-Benz SLK320 , Toyota 's Camry Solara Convertible , and the soft-top version of Volkswagen 's New Beetle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a redesigned Integra and the upscale 3.2 CL ( and its performance-minded version , the 260-hp Type S ) . Pickups <p> The biggest news here is an array of full four-door crew-cab models , including the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma Crewcabs , the Toyota Double Cab Tacoma , and the full-size Chevy Silverado . Experts agree that where available , buyers are increasingly choosing the extra passenger space offered by a crew cab . <p> Chrysler Sebring <p> Oldsmobile Aurora <p> Dodge Caravan <p> Volvo S60 <p> Toyota Sequoia <p> RAISING THE SAFETY BAR <p> A mix of new technology and the wider availability of existing systems is helping to raise the level of safety in many 2001 cars . <p> Air bags and stability control Electronic stability control is filtering down to models like the Ford Focus and Oldsmobile Intrigue . Side air bags are available on such cars as the Focus , Nissan Sentra , Toyota Corolla , and Chrysler PT Cruiser , while inflatable curtain-type head-protection bags will be standard on most Volkswagens and optional on all Saturns . The 2002 Ford Explorer , due out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags . <p> A new generation of dual-stage front air bags is appearing in many cars . In a low-level collision , the system inflates the front air bags less aggressively - with 70 to 80 percent of the force of a single-stage airbag . In a higher-speed collision - likely in no more than 5 percent of accidents , GM engineers estimate - they will inflate with full force , providing a firmer cushion of air . <p> Using sensors in the front passenger seat , systems now in Acura , BMW , and Mercedes-Benz cars can , depending on model , detect the presence , height , and sitting position of a person in the front passenger seat and deactivate front and side air bags as appropriate to minimize the chance of inadvertent injury at low speed . Mercedes ' BabySmart system also deactivates the passenger-seat air bag if there 's a special child carrier buckled in up front . <p> Adaptive cruise control This new system being introduced on Mercedes-Benz 2001 S- and CL-Class models ( under the name Distronic ) , use radar to scan ahead about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it detects another car in front , moving at a slower speed , Distronic will automatically reduce power and even gently apply the brakes . In addition , it lets a driver maintain a predetermined distance behind another vehicle . He or she sets the following distance ; the car will automatically maintain that distance , slowing or speeding up as necessary . The system , however , is n't designed to handle emergency stops ; the driver must still do that . <p> Emergency response systems Both OnStar - available this year on Saab and 32 GM models - and Mercedes ' Tele Aid system can automatically call for help following a collision , even if the driver is unconscious . Using GPS coordinates , a 24-hour control center can then direct emergency aid to the vehicle 's location . Acura will also offer OnStar on its 2002 RL sedan , and Ford will offer a similar system for 2001 . In addition , buyers of Alpine 's Mobile Mayday system can subscribe to a service that 's similar to OnStar or Tele Aid , and use it in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise control can automatically maintain a preset distance behind another vehicle <p> PLUGGING INTO THE DIGITAL AGE <p> Two new digital technologies debut this year : in-car Internet and satellite digital radio . Both could represent a fundamental change in the way we receive information and entertainment while in our cars . IN-CAR INTERNET <p> The race to bring wireless Internet into our cars is led by two U.S. companies : General Motors and Ford . For 2001 , this service will be available to consumers in three different systems . Both Cadillac and Lincoln will launch onboard systems that will enable drivers to download news updates , traffic reports , sports scores , stock quotes , and weather reports . Cadillac 's system , optional in the DeVille and Seville , will also offer e-mail . <p> In addition , Internet capabilities will be added to the OnStar system through " Virtual Advisor , " a feature that will be available in 32 GM models this year . Though not yet scheduled for release , BMW and Mercedes-Benz also have plans to introduce Internet systems in the near future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars with Clarion 's aftermarket AutoPC . <p> Each of the automaker systems will offer hands-free , voice-interactive control , meaning that drivers will be able to request specific information simply by speaking key phrases , and the system will use text-to-voice capabilities to " read " the information to the driver . In addition to the hardware cost , buyers will also need to pay a monthly subscription fee , plus cellular phone airtime . <p> This new technology add to the growing concern about an increased risk of accidents caused by driver distraction from cell phones . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , for instance , estimates that about a quarter of the 6.3 million crashes each year are caused by the distracted drivers . To gain more data in this area , the agency will be studying how drivers interact with the new electronic technology . <p> In answer to this concern , the Cadillac and Virtual Advisor systems are designed so that Internet or e-mail functions will not operate while the vehicle is in motion . SATELLITE DIGITAL RADIO <p> This service , available for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two companies : Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio . Both will use their own satellites to broadcast up to 100 channels of digital radio programming across the entire contiguous U.S. In addition to static-free , higher-fidelity sound , this will allow travelers to listen to their chosen stations while driving from coast to coast , even in remote rural areas . To receive these signals , drivers will need a compatible radio . Programming will consist of a mix of commercial-free music channels plus a broad selection of existing programming , ranging from National Public Radio to popular talk and music shows . Sirius hopes to be operational by the end of the year , XM by next spring . <p> A number of automakers will offer compatible systems beginning with their 2001 models , but what car you buy could determine which service you get . Sirius , for example , has exclusive partnerships with BMW , Daimler-Chrysler , and Ford , while XM is linked with GM and Honda . In addition , a number of aftermarket companies , such as Alpine , Audiovox , Clarion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanyo , and Visteon , will sell compatible radios , which allow any car owner to upgrade to the new service . Prices will begin at about $150 . <p> GOING DIGITAL Look for satellite digital radio to debut this coming year . <p> Look for in-car Internet to debut this coming year <p>
