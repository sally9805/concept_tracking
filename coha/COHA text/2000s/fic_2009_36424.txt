" You call this place a ' health ' club ? It looks like a medieval torture chamber . What 's so bloomin ' healthy about it ? " Savannah Reid said as she and her friend , Tammy Hart , stepped out of the women 's locker room and into Savannah 's idea of " fitness hell . " <p> She shuddered as she looked around the controversial , militaristic gym with its prison-gray walls , bare cement floor , and jungle of sinister-looking workout equipment . Overhead florescent lights sputtered , while a frenetic noise that might have been called " music " boomed around them . The nerve-jarring racket was interspersed with an abrasive , brassy , female voice , screaming at those who were working out to " Go ! Go ! Go , you tub-o ! Move ! Move ! Move that lard ! Work that lazy ass ! Do n't you dare stop ! " <p> The only thing that might even remotely be considered " dTcor " was an eight-foot-tall poster on one wall , a picture of a woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latex bodysuit . Savannah could only classify her as a cross between a Marine drill sergeant and a dominatrix . <p> Savannah elbowed Tammy and nodded toward the sweat-drenched men and women , slaving away at the gleaming steel devices . " They actually pay money to do this ... to listen to her mouth , to get insulted and demeaned like that ? " <p> " They pay big money . Pain does n't come cheap in Clarissa 's House of Pain and Gain . " <p> They walked to the far end of the room , which was slightly less crowded , and found a couple of machines that were side by side and unoccupied . <p> Tammy removed her camouflage-print sweat suit-the club uniform-revealing a T-shirt , shorts , and a svelte , trim body that even Clarissa Jardin would have to declare " nearly perfect . " <p> She sat on the seat of one of the machines , placed her arms between some cushioned pads , and began to expertly push them together in front of her chest , then release them back to her sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammy 's and began to do the same . <p> As Savannah worked muscles that she 'd forgotten she had , she glanced down at her own khaki and olive drab sweat suit that she had donned for this undercover gig and began to question her commitment to the assignment . <p> No doubt , the founder of this fine establishment-and all of its sister franchises across the nation-would not consider her robust figure " perfect . " In fact , although Savannah was quite happy with her own body and its curves , she was pretty sure that Clarissa Jardin would consider her a " tub-o . " And if you listened to Clarissa 's shtick on the talk show circuit , being not-so-svelte put you at the bottom of the human barrel , along with serial killers , puppy drowners , and cupcake eaters . <p> About a year ago , the fitness diva had moved from Los Angeles to Savannah 's hometown , the quaint , Southern California village of San Carmelita . A small , seaside community , their citizenry consisted of wealthy celebs escaping the smog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were also seeking fresh air and relaxation ; and common folks like Savannah and Dirk who made their livings catering to the celebs and tourists . <p> San Carmelita had buzzed with gossip when Clarissa had moved there . Savannah 's opinion had been : Big whoopty-do . Just what we needed ... another loudmouthed luminary with an attitude . <p> " I 'm hating this already , " she muttered to herself . " Dirk 's going to owe me , big time , for this one . " <p> On the opposite side of the room , their friend , Detective Sergeant Dirk Coulter was already deeply immersed in his undercover persona . Grunting , groaning , and red in the face , he was quite successfully manipulating some sort of contraption with wires , pulleys , and weights . <p> Not bad for an old fart , Savannah thought as she watched his arm and shoulder muscles bulge with the effort . She had to admit , he still looked pretty darned good in a tank top . She amended the thought to semi-old fart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years older than she . <p> They were really just kids . Okay , kids with twenty-plus years of hardcore life experience . His were cop years . Hers were cop and private investigator years . And , like dog years , those added up fast . <p> " Yeah , " Tammy said . " We ladies of the Moonlight Magnolia Detective Agency do n't work cheap . " <p> Savannah did n't reply . There was no point in stating the obvious-that the members of the Moonlight Magnolia Detective Agency had n't been working at all lately . <p> No clients . No income . Hence the opportunity to do freebies for Dirk . <p> " Yes , " Tammy said . " After this , old Dirko is going to owe us both a nice dinner at Chez Antoine . " She motioned toward one of the nearest machines . " But even better than that , think how much fun it 'll be if we nail the perv . " <p> " True . So true . " Smiling a nasty little grin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working the rows of equipment . <p> If they could nab the guy who was somehow taking candid shots of the gym 's female clients in various stages of nakedness and posting the pictures on the Internet , it would all be worth it . Heck , Dirk would n't even have to buy them dessert at Antoine 's . <p> Savannah had a mental flash of the French chef 's dessert cart and quickly modified that thought , too . No , whether they caught this guy or not , Dirk was going to pay , and the fee would be expensive , highly saturated fat calories . <p> Savannah watched as he paused between repetitions and glanced over at the cute , twenty-something , chickie-poo on the machine next to him . He sucked in his belly , flexed his biceps , and gave the young woman what he no doubt thought was a sexy , come-hither grin . <p> It was all Savannah could do not to stomp across the room , smack him on the head with a barbell , and remind him that he was old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought down the urge . She was nothing if not the model of self-restraint . <p> Besides , she had to give him a little credit for the self-confidence-okay , delusions of grandeur-that enabled him to think he had a chance with the girl . <p> The thought occurred to her : If women could remain as confident in their own beauty as men were in their studliness for so long in life , the world would be a happier place . <p> " Anybody look suspicious to you ? " Tammy asked . <p> " Not really , " Savannah said as she considered their possible culprits . <p> Clarissa 's devotees were a wide demographic , judging from the group assembled in the House of Pain and Gain today . On the rowing machine , a seventy-ish lady in a bright purple and red sweat suit worked those handles like a Roman galley slave . She had a fanatical gleam in her eyes as she stroked in time to the pulsing music , punctuated with Clarissa 's admonitions to " Work ! Work ! Get the rust out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt ! " <p> Savannah thought of her own octogenarian grandmother , Granny Reid , and chuckled to think of how the feisty Southern lady would react to Clarissa 's brand of encouragement . If anyone were to suggest to Gran that she was lazy or carried any excess baggage , they might just receive a skillet greased with bacon fat upside the head . And along with the corrective smack , they 'd get a lecture about how " sportin ' a few extra pounds to begin with got a lot of good folks through the dark days of the Great Depression . " <p> Gran was big on stories about the Great Depression , skillet smacking , and the incalculable culinary value of fresh bacon grease . <p> But Savannah could n't stop and think about Gran at the moment for two reasons : One , she would start missing her grandmother and be tempted to hop a plane to Georgia . And two , she had a peeping , picture-taking Tom to catch and a life to live here in sunny Southern California ... not to mention a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With her priorities firmly in place , she continued to scan the Clarissa Jardin exercise fiends . <p> The twenty-something hunk hefting barbells near Dirk was a possibility . He was gorgeous , probably of Mediterranean descent , obviously a serious bodybuilder . As he lifted first one weight , then the other , he watched his own reflection in a nearby mirror . <p> Savannah doubted that he had time or inclination to gawk at anybody 's bod but his own . <p> Tammy seemed to read her thoughts . She leaned close to Savannah , her mouth close to her ear , and shouted above the booming music . " I do n't think it 's him . He 's just into himself . " <p> " Yeah , and who can blame him ? " <p> Tammy giggled . " Dirk 's watching you watch him . He 's got his jealous puss on . " <p> Looking over at Dirk , Savannah saw that he was , indeed , wearing a frown . And it probably was a jealous scowl , though , with Dirk it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions were scowls . <p> Savannah grinned and winked at him . " It 's okay for him to check out the babes , " she shouted back to Tammy , " but heaven forbid we should peruse the dudes . " <p> " He would n't care if I were the one looking . He 's only jealous of you . " <p> " We 're trying to catch a perv here and- " <p> " Dirk 's got it for you bad . " <p> " Nobody 's got nothin ' for nobody . End of subject . " <p> Tammy snickered . " Whatever you say , boss lady . " <p> " I say ... I think we should keep an eye on the creepo with the potbelly in the too-tight shorts over there . " She discreetly nodded toward a middle-aged guy on a stationary bicycle near the window . His electric-blue latex shorts announced to the world that he was neither well-endowed nor circumcised . And both facts were bits of information that Savannah would have gladly lived and died without knowing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else , " Tammy added . " If that is any luck , it 'll be him . " <p> Savannah continued to hope and work the machines , as she and Tammy moved around the room , trying first one apparatus , then another . <p> Dirk stuck with his weird pulley contraption , and Savannah was pretty sure he did so to remain close to the bimbo next to him . She made a mental note to mention the fact to him later , to point out what a fool he had made of himself . <p> Hey , he did n't have a wife to do it . Somebody had to build the guy 's character . <p> And all the time , Savannah watched the weirdo in the blue shorts and hoped he would do something suspicious ... other than dress grotesquely . <p> But he did n't . <p> She kept constant tabs on him throughout his short and nonexhaustive workout , but he finished , disappeared into the men 's locker room , and left the establishment , wearing skintight jeans and a mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the women 's locker room entrance . <p> Meanwhile , Savannah 's muscles were starting to complain . Bitterly . " This bites , " she told Tammy . " Whoever our guy is , he 's not here today . We might as well leave . " <p> " Yeah , really . " Tammy paused and dabbed a couple of barely there drops of sweat from her brow with a towel . " I need to get out of here and go on my daily run . I want to help Dirk , but this is seriously cutting into my own personal workout time . " <p> Soaking wet with sweat , hurting in every atom of her body , feeling every one of her forty-plus years , Savannah decided not to tumble off the machine , fall onto the floor , and curl into a fetal position . Doing so would lack a certain ... dignity . <p> " Daily run , my ass , " she muttered . <p> " Huh ? " <p> Tammy looked so sweet and innocent . Savannah also decided not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said . " Make it obvious to Mr. Muscles and those older guys in the corner over there that you 're on your way to the locker room . Maybe we 'll get lucky and one of them will follow you . I 'll keep an eye on them while I tell Dirk this gig is over . At least for today . " <p> " You got it . " <p> Tammy gathered her towel , clothes , and water bottle and sashayed toward the women 's locker room door . At least , she tried to sashay . Savannah smiled , thinking that she really could n't expect a Yankee gal to priss properly . If a girl was n't raised on sweet tea and buttermilk biscuits , a certain wiggle was missing from her walk . ' T was a shame , but it could n't be helped . <p> However , Tammy was fulfilling her duties as bimbo bait quite well . Savannah could n't help noticing how every set of male eyes followed her friend as she left the room . Undoubtedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervert among them , Tammy 's tight , size-zero heinie would draw him out . <p> Savannah picked up her gym bag , walked over to Dirk , leaned down , and said in his ear , " Okay , big boy . Your girls have enjoyed about as much of this bullpucky as we can stand . We 're pulling the plug and heading home . " <p> " Gotcha , " he replied , looking as tired and disgusted as she felt . " The magic is pretty much gone for me , too . " <p> She followed his eyes as he watched the girl who had been next to him walk away and head toward the locker room herself . On the way , she stopped and said something to Mr. Bulging Biceps , then gave him a quick kiss . <p> " Hm-m-m , " Dirk grumbled . " And I figured he was gay . " <p> " You think all muscular guys with great hair are gay . " <p> His feathers instantly ruffled . " You like his hair ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hair is hair . Frankly , I think it 's overrated , but- " <p> " Go shower . " <p> " I 'm going to . And I 've got ta keep an eye on the kid , in case it 's a janitor or somebody who works here sneaking in the back door or whatever . " <p> " Give a yell if you need me . " <p> She gave him a sweet smile . Sweeter than he deserved , considering how he 'd been ogling the barely legal female next to him . " We always holler out for you , sugar , when we need to be rescued by a burnin ' hunk o ' manhood . " <p> He lit up so brightly that she felt guilty and did n't have the heart to tell him she was pulling his leg . The only time she " hollered out " for him was when she needed someone to hold down her sofa , eat her popcorn , drink her beer , and watch boxing on her TV . <p> Or when she needed a dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door in the back marked " Women 's Locker Room . " And even though Clarissa was still screeching about the horrors of lard and cellulite , Savannah could n't help noticing that male eyes followed her own figure , too . Maybe not as many as Tammy 's , but she still had her share of admirers . <p> A good sashay mixed with a hearty dash of self-confidence went a long way when it came to attraction and sex appeal . <p> She was feeling tired and lazy and relaxed when she entered the locker room , ready to just shower , go home , and kick back . <p> But the moment she passed through the dressing area and into the showers , a creepy , apprehensive feeling washed over her . The hair was n't exactly standing up on the back of her neck , but she had the sensation that some sort of threat was nearby . <p> It was an intuitive warning that she had felt many times before as a police officer and since , as a private investigator . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She opened her mouth to call out to Tammy , but thought better of it . Instead , she glanced around , taking in the closed door on the back wall of the long , narrow room , the two rows of shower stalls on either side . <p> She could hear more than one shower running . The odor of disinfectants , mixed with the floral smells of soaps and shampoos , scented the humid air . <p> Only three stalls were being used , their plastic curtains drawn . She walked quietly between the rows , bending over to peek at the bare feet exposed between the bottom of the curtain and the floor . <p> Tammy 's perfectly pedicured , hot pink toenails made identification easy . Three stalls away from Tammy were a pair of feet wearing bright red and purple flip-flops-the senior lady from the rowing machine , no doubt . <p> But it was the feet wearing the sneakers that caught her eye . Sneakers and jeans . <p> In the stall right next to Tammy 's pink toes . <p> Silently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled it aside a few inches . <p> A wet , sudsy Tammy whirled around , but Savannah pressed her finger against her lips in a silent " Sh-h-h , " then pointed to the plastic curtain that separated her shower stall from the one next to it . <p> Tammy 's eyes widened , but she nodded . <p> At least twenty thoughts and decisions processed in Savannah 's brain in the next few seconds , the major ones being : Weapon 's in my gym bag . Do n't pull it yet . Handcuffs in waistband . No time to call Dirk . Tammy 's wet and slippery . Wo n't be much help . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
