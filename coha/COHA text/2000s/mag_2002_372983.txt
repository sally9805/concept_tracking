The amnesia afflicting Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon ) is , luckily for him , only partial . He ca n't quite remember what line of work he 's in ( CIA assassin ) or how he came to be floating , more dead than alive , in the Mediterranean Sea one dark and stormy night . <P> On the other hand , once a fishing boat picks him up and he dries off , various useful bits of information suddenly come back to him . For example , the number of a Swiss bank account that contains wads of cash , fraudulent passports and a revolver . A little later , when people start trying to kill him , his skills with karate , a wide assortment of weaponry and getting out of tight spots also return . <P> We need not send very far to know who is after him . It 's his old CIA pals , most notably the grimly implacable Ted Conklin ( Chris Cooper ) . They do n't want to get tangled up in the loose ends of his previous failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest electronics to aid them . He has only Marie ( Franka Potente , late of Run Lola Run ) , whom he picked up in Zurich , but she is a game gal  --  and an unglamorously appealing one too . <P> This movie , postponed from the fall and fairly loosely adapted from the 1980 thriller by Robert Ludlum , does n't really have a thought in its mind . It just wants to send Jason and Marie skittering around Europe . But the locales are wintry and attractive , and the director , Doug Liman , has a nice gift not just for your standard car chases but also for potentially deadly and seemingly unpremeditated surprises . We wo n't spoil them with too much detail . Just remember that a peaceful-looking countryside offers many places in which a guy with a high-powered rifle can take cover . <P> The Bourne Identity has a couple of things going for it beyond the slick expertise of its making . One of them is Matt Damon . He 's a cute guy , but not , in this instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a man feeling his way along dangerous ground , with no memory to guide him , might behave . Which is warily . He does n't have a lot of energy to spare for comic quips or romantic dither either . Think of him as the anti-007 . <P> The other good thing about this movie is , oddly enough , its utter irrelevance to all the things that have made us anxious for the past eight months . There are no terrorists present , no threats of ghastly weaponry falling into erratic hands . The bad guys remain traditional bureaucrats trying to cover their backsides . They still attempt to kill the old-fashioned way , up close and personal , but without a fanatic 's awful malice . The result is an escapist fantasy that is  --  Damon 's and Potente 's persuasive performances aside  --  as weightless and inconsequential as a musical . And at the moment every bit as welcome .  --  By Richard Schickel
