Rebekah of the violet eyes heard a voice that would haunt her the rest of her life . " I know she 's only ten . I 'll be patient . " She hugged her doll and tossed on her pallet . The heat , the flies , and the soothing words of the strange man in the next room interrupted her sleep . Visitors were rare in her home . Her widowed mother left at dawn to wash other people 's laundry . In the evenings , Rebekah learned from her mother to bake pistachio cookies and crispy rice , to differentiate between aromatic herbs , and to flatter the man who would one day take care of her . Rebekah pressed her ear to the makeshift wall . Her mother 's cough shattered the silence . As if the cough had originated from her own lungs , Rebekah clutched her chest . " She 's the prettiest girl in Persia . I 'm saving her for a rich husband . " Suspended between wakefulness and sleep , Rebekah heard the man 's melodious persistence , promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saffron halva , fantasies peculiar to her dreams . * Soon after , Rebekah and her mother went to the house of bougainvillea to visit the Ancient Zoroastrian , a clairvoyant who had witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties . She was the only person alive who had seen a time before evil was introduced into the world , a time when the great prophet Ahura Mazda of goodness ruled . At the end of the alley of pomegranate trees , Rebekah and her mother approached the single room buried under lavish flowers . They parted the branches , searching for the low entrance , and nudged open the door that was never locked . Lingering at the threshold , they waited to be acknowledged . The old woman sat cross-legged next to a brazier heaped with blazing coals on which seeds of rue crackled and smoked , permeating the air with anticipation . The Zoroastrian 's ash-colored skin stretched taut over fragile bones . She had lost all her hair to the ravages of time . Her purple eyelids concealed inquisitive eyes . Rebekah 's mother averted her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , and the red chicken eyes that were set in gold and glared at her from the Zoroastrian 's pierced earlobes . " Holy One , I 've promised Rebekah 's hand in marriage . She 's here to ask for your blessing . " The Zoroastrian did not lift her head , open her eyes , or ask any question . She had gazed into her fire and had seen Rebekah and her mother approach . The old one had clutched her bony knees and had chuckled out in glee . She had shifted closer to the flames to better inhale the scent of pearls , silk , rapture , and bliss . Neither the mother nor the child was aware that marvelous miracles were about to occur in Rebekah 's life . " Rebekah 's fate is sealed , " the Ancient Zoroastrian murmured in a voice that had retained the vigor of youth . " Her future is embellished with crowns and jewels . A life of lust and passion , conspiracy and love . At times , it will be difficult , but never , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Rebekah 's head . " May Ahura Mazda bless you and may he grant me more years on this earth to revel in the impending miracles . " * In the synagogue of the One-Eyed Rabbi , Rebekah 's mother folded a parchment and handed it to Rebekah . " This is signed proof you 're a married woman . " She pressed her lips to her daughter 's golden curls . " Your husband is rich . You 'll live in comfort . " Glancing at the parchment that dangled from her fingers , Rebekah knew she had to accept her fate . She was sad but not scared . Promises of toys and veils and sweets , of kindness and patience and love reverberated in her head . Her mother had married her to the stranger with the sweet voice . " Your husband will not join you in bed before your first menstrual period , " her mother whispered , tears in her voice . " Since I wo n't be here for long , you must demand that he keep his word . " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless coughing and the terrible wheezing in her chest , and why she had found it necessary to discuss the importance of a wife 's responsibilities . Rebekah held her mother 's hand as she led her past the stalls in the bazaar toward her husband 's house . The ground was thick with chicken feathers , horse manure , and decayed melon rinds . The cries of the vendors of ice water , hookah pipes , and hot tea filled the air . Lopsided poles held white canvases that sheltered vendors from the fierce sunshine . Goods were exhibited at the entrances strings of figs suspended overhead , roasted nuts and dried beans overflowing canvas sacks , cones of sugar perched on sloping counters . The greengrocer in his skirted robe , belted at the waist with a multicolored shawl , lifted his cone-shaped hat and scratched his shaved head . He wet his henna-tinged forefinger in his mouth , then smeared his saliva on Rebekah 's cheeks to scare away the evil eye . From an assortment of persimmons , pomegranates , and yellow melons open to the flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and offered her a slice . " For the violet-eyed beauty . " She bit into the bloody fruit , sucked on the seeds , and tasted the familiar tang of powdered nutmeg and ice flowers . She dropped the rest in her pocket to save for her husband . They reached the end of the Alley of Ezekiel the Cobbler . " This is your home , " her mother whispered . " Your husband is thirty-four years old . He 'll take care of you . " Her home was the color of mud . From behind an iron fence that protected the house , she saw jasmine bushes , a walnut tree , and a patch of arid land . " Rebekah , " her mother said . " Look ! Enough space for you to plant geranium and flowering almond and myrtle like your garden back home . " " Water our garden , Madar . Do n't let it dry like this . " At her mother 's touch , the gate groaned open . Rebekah stepped into the smell of hot coals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhale her scent of caramelized sugar and licorice . Her mother squeezed her to her breasts . " You 'll never be alone . I 'll always be looking over you , " she said , releasing her and walking out the door . Rebekah ran to the window and peered out through the curtains , past the rusting iron gate . Clutching her doll in one hand and the parchment in another , she watched her mother 's wide hips disappear around the turn of the alley . A bird fluttered against the window . The breeze ruffled the leaves of the ancient walnut tree . She turned around to look for the stranger , her husband with the lullaby voice of a storyteller . Heavy , gold-colored drapes darkened the room . Silver masks , Her stomach churned at the glitter . She averted her gaze from the flames in the hearth , from the poker ; mesh glove and thongs suspended from hooks hammered into the cracks in the baked mud walls around the furnace . " I am Jacob the Fatherless . " A fat man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His grating voice shattered her dreams . This was not the man with a voice like music . His hand that smelled of burning metal grabbed her doll and sent it flying toward the kiln . She rushed to catch the doll . Flames licked the cotton face and devoured the wool dress . Rebekah leaned over the ledge that faced the kiln and thrust her hand into the fire . Jumping back , she stuffed her fingers into her mouth to soothe the burnt flesh . Her doll sizzled into black smoke , gray ash , nothing . Jacob the Fatherless bowed in mock courtesy and straightened , lifting his stomach with a groan . Spidery legs sprouted from his swollen body , and dark , knotted curls framed his bloated cheeks . " I am a blacksmith a creator , " he said , his crossed eyes struggling for balance . " I melt iron into any shape and alloy I want . All my life I 've worked toward a day when everything I melt will turn into gold . " Her mind reeled , trying to contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned her to this man ? He spat into the fire , tilted his head , and paused to relish the sizzle . " Your mother negotiated a bargain . She married you to Jacob the Fatherless . A man born without a father . " Her mother 's lessons came to her rescue , and she gazed at Jacob with wet , violet eyes , blew on her hand , and fluttered her lashes , pretending fascination . " Soon I 'll become the richest man in the Jewish Quarter . Do you know why ? I 'm one of the few who endures this fire . The heat has ignited a permanent furnace in my heart . Even in my sleep , flames lash behind my lids . " He shot another stream of spittle into the flames , then stared back at her . " I know a secret that will make me eternal like gold remain forever in one form or another , liquid or solid . Then , like God , I 'll never die . Do you understand , Rebekah ? " Rebekah did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the man-sized furnace in the bedroom , she understood fear . Fear of the kiln , the fire , the madness in his eyes , the heat that turned into beads of sweat on his face while he molded metals into knives , cauldrons , and pots . In the kitchen , he nailed metal sheets on the counter and the wall behind the wood burner , in the dining room over the table and stools , in their bedroom on top of the baked-mud floors . Past midnight , his eyes raked the house for scraps to feed his voracious flames . He formed ornamental trinkets from the remnants of metal and locked them in a box . He dangled the key in front of her face . " Who are the trinkets for ? " she asked , curiosity overcoming her fear . He unbuttoned his coat and dropped the key in the secret pocket of his vest , stroking the place where it was buried . " One day you 'll know . " When dawn glanced through the window , he nodded toward one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may retire now . " He occupied the other pallet . He tossed about , grumbling for hours , then raised himself and approached her . He lingered overhead , tapped his small , feminine feet against her pallet . Lifted the blanket and stared down at her . She squeezed her eyes shut and pretended to be asleep . Pressing his thumb on the artery at the side of her neck , he counted the pulse of her fear . The acrid odor of liquid iron flowed from his hands and stung her nostrils . " Open your legs ! " he ordered . " You promised ! " she cried , her eyes springing open , her hands struggling to escape . " No one , " he growled , " extracts promises from Jacob the Fatherless . " " You gave your word of honor ! " " Honor ! What honor ? " She fought to keep her thighs locked . " Madar ! " She screamed , certain the urgency of her pain would summon her mother . He thrust her thighs open and mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his moans like those of wounded animals . Or were those her cries , her pain , her loss ? Where was the man who had asked for her hand , who had promised to be patient ? Blood burned her thighs . " Never , ever grow , " he panted , emptying himself . * By twelve , Rebekah 's violet eyes had acquired a defiant spark , her curls the sheen of gold , and her lips the blush of wine . The burned skin on her fingers had the pallor and snug fit of an old glove that had , at last , conformed to her hand , and like her , had learned to cope with and survive the world of Jacob . Her veiled gaze followed him as he shuffled around their home . Even in his absence , she did n't dare search the house for the gold bullion he amassed with the money he earned melting iron . Every evening he sent her into the garden before he made sure nothing was missing , then he changed the hiding places of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Tonight he fished a large bone from a bowl of hot stew . The heat did not penetrate the thick skin of his fingers . He slammed the bone on a metal plate to empty the marrow , soaked bread and mint in it , and devoured the concoction . He stroked his bloated stomach , stuffed a skewer of ground kebab with mint leaves into his mouth , and belched . A smile of contentment hovered on his face . He complimented her on the freshness of the mint she picked daily , reminding her that without his money that bounty would not have been possible . She looked forward to the hours she spent cultivating her herbs , not only because her patch of land evoked the home she longed for , but also because from behind the railings she could observe the dancing Gypsies . Rebekah fed the earth with leftover stew and chickpea paste and sprayed the leaves with a mixture of honey and wine to attract the praying mantis . On Fridays , when the first chorus of cymbals , tambourines , and shakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expecting the Gypsies . Colorful , flowing skirts and sleeve ruffles came into view first around the bend of the alley , then plump , feminine figures twirled and spun and swayed in dances Rebekah captured again in her dreams . The vegetation in her garden doubled in size and turned a deep , glossy green , and the dances in her dreams developed and matured in ways she did not understand . What she found out was that something as innocent as a bunch of herbs concealed a secret that helped her subdue Jacob . The taste , the scent , the sizzle of burning mint must summon his lust for gold and pacify him . If he did not chew or smell mint , he seemed to appease himself with her body . Selecting a sprig , she inhaled the tangy-sweet fragrance . Was it addictive ? She touched a leaf to her tongue , tore and chewed on it , tasting its bitter tartness . Why did he prefer it toasted ? She held the leaves over the embers on her stove . In her mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned fingers . If only she could muster the courage to ask the wandering Gypsies if mint regulated some part of the body . Added to a man 's sense of virility ? Dampened his cruelty ? Made a tight-fisted man sometimes generous ? Even Jacob , at times , strove to be generous . One warm Saturday evening , when nightingales and the scent of jasmine lured Rebekah to her herb garden , Jacob arrived with a rolled parchment . " The plan for our new house . I 'll build it even farther from the garbage pit . " Rebekah realized the importance of owning a home far from the pit , a mound of garbage in the center of the Jewish Quarter around which makeshift stalls displayed fruits , nuts , and spices . She missed the inviting scents and friendly voices ; the comforting closeness of people , her mother 's avid bargaining as she selected provisions . Did n't her mother know she was not allowed out of the house alone ? Why did n't she visit ? Did Jacob forbid it ? " Come inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my lap , while I explain . I 'll build our house at the end of the Alley of Lanterns , where a plot of land is so expensive , your little mind wo n't grasp its value . " " Can I choose the furniture ? " " No , " he replied . " The fabrics for the curtains ? " " What do you know about fabrics ? " " My mother says I 've a talent for colors . " " You have none . " " Yes , I do . " His fleshy hands slid under her hips , raised her high in the air , and dropped her to the floor . " Madar ! " Her breath twisted in her lungs . " She ca n't hear you , " he barked . Lying flat on her back , his shadow a dark blanket between her and the light of the oil burner , she swore that one day she would destroy Jacob the Fatherless . * Dawn after dawn , she splashed cool water on her face , tossed a chador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alley of Lanterns to watch him build their house with his own hands . He dug her an estakhr behind the house , paving it with turquoise tiles and filling it with fresh water from a well he had dug . " Your private estakhr ! " he announced , pausing for her appreciation . Rebekah watched the sun dance on the golden waters and her heart beat with anticipation . Could the Ancient Zoroastrian 's prophecy of jewels and love and happiness come true in this house ? Jacob lifted a finger . " You must always swim fully dressed , or I 'll flog you to death . Even the stars of heaven must not set eyes on a single toenail of yours . Be chaste and virginal at all times , except in my bed , when you 'll transform yourself into a whore . And I 'll reward you by treating you like a queen . " The next evening , Jacob arrived home carrying a dress of crushed velvet , a pair of kid boots , and a chador of China silk . He flung them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thighs with gleeful pride . Rewarded for the evenings she had surrendered her body to him ! She slipped back into the kitchen to serve his dinner : shank , bone marrow , and mint . Tonight , as every other night , she hid a portion of the meal . Her loneliness was easier to bear if she imagined a time when the stranger with the sweet voice would knock on her door and ask her to collect provisions for the road because they were , at last , leaving for a safer place . " Where 's the mint ? " Jacob demanded when Rebekah returned with the steaming stew . She hurried back to the kitchen . Delicate leaves , slender sprigs , lush bunches of mint had become her friends . Most of his waking hours , while he labored over the kiln , he chewed or smelled mint she picked from her garden . It seemed she had trained him , like a dog , to associate the taste and smell of mint with that of liquid gold . Now the scent of mint made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he did n't seem to have to copulate with her as often to validate himself . She heard his approaching steps , heard him linger at the door , enter the kitchen . She did not move . There was nowhere to flee . He was behind her , his stomach flattening her against the wood burner , his breath on her neck , his voice calling her a whore-wife , his hands tearing her vest , groping her buttocks , dragging her back into the room , pushing her down on the pile of garments he had purchased . Not only had he thrust early womanhood upon her , but he felt he had made up for it with a heap of expensive fabrics and sheer veils she despised . Her gaze roamed the ceiling , forming shadows of fantastical animals and birds and plants , a world where the pain of Jacob 's body on top of her and the bitterness of his broken promise to her mother did not matter . A place where the Ancient Zoroastrian 's miracles would come true , where she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say you 're my whore-wife ! " Jacob 's voice came from afar . " Never . " " One day you will , " he moaned , crushing her into velvet and silk . Soon , she thought , he will rise and go about his work . For a few hours , she would be left alone in the refuge of her imagination . She tugged the chador of China silk from under her head and studied its shades of orange , red , and yellow . The colors of fire . She threw the veil over her face to inhale the smell of silk and dye and shame . Jacob 's breathing settled . He lifted himself and tossed a coat over his naked body . " Wait right here . I 've a surprise for you . " Her palm sliding over her body , Rebekah watched her husband leave . Her hips were slightly fuller , her breasts beginning to ripen , and so was her shame . " Come out , " she heard Jacob calling from the garden . She buried her face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not need any more garments or jewelry or perfumes that reeked of disgrace , favors that fed her grief . Through the silk and velvet that covered her ears , she heard him summon her with the tone reserved for times he believed he was indulging her . Had he mistaken the humiliation on her face for gratitude ? When his voice curdled with irritation , she lifted herself . She leaned naked against the doorway . The breeze carried a biting coolness , and the moon sailed in a cloudless sky . A raucous noise came from behind the house . The stamping of hooves ? Jacob emerged into the garden , pulling a donkey by a rope tied around its neck and muzzle . Her breath caught at the most beautiful sight she had ever seen . The animal 's pelt was the color of onyx , with a goose-white band that stretched from its muzzle all the way down to its lush and restless tail . With every jerk of the rope , the donkey turned its neck , thrust its red tongue out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Jacob flying to the ground . Rebekah pursed her lips to stifle her laughter . She felt an immediate affinity with the stubborn donkey . Jacob ran after the donkey , pulling the animal around to face her . " This is the only male who may glance at a single strand of your hair . " Rebekah was ecstatic . She had found another who would spit at Jacob . She saw that the animal 's penis dangled almost to the ground . To spite all signs of masculinity , she named him Venus .
