<p> About nine years ago , a chestnut thoroughbred named Creme de la Fete was assigned a new groom , Efrain Silva . He gave the horse antibiotics , scrubbed his mane and forelegs , dewormed him and , in Mr. Silva 's estimation , prolonged his life for about three years . <p> But when Creme , as he affectionately called the horse , grew old and weak , Mr. Silva was not ready for it . Creme had become his second family , the only living being he had any meaningful relationship with on many afternoons . <p> Told that Creme , a former racehorse , had been euthanized while he was at lunch one afternoon , Mr. Silva wept openly in front of his fellow inmates in the mess hall at the Wallkill Correctional Facility , themedium-security state prison here . <p> " I fell in love with that horse , " said Mr. Silva , who was sentenced to 15 years to life for shooting a man to death while intoxicated in front of a Bronx liquor store in 1981 . " The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says : ' I 'm going to take care of you , Creme . You watch . ' " <p> Through a partnership with the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation , the nation 's largest and oldest thoroughbred-rescue operation , the prison has operated a work program for the past 18 years for inmates to care for the former champions , runners-up and perennial losers . Most of them no longer have practical economic value  --  other than the $600 a meat buyer might pay  --  before they come to a pasture in upstate New York to live out their years . <p> Some of the horses had been discarded , left for dead in their stables before being rescued by the foundation and turned over to the program 's director , Jim Tremper , and his 18-inmate crew . <p> " If we did n't get to them , they would be pet food or on someone 's plate in Europe , " Mr. Tremper said . <p> He said he had seen the thoroughbreds change the prisoners ' lives as much as they changed the horses ' . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A lot of them have intimidated people with their size in their lives , and they seem to respect the power and strength of the animal . It humbles many of them . " <p> The program is less rehabilitation therapy than hard labor on many afternoons . Still , the inmates who care for the horses need to exhibit good behavior , usually for two years , and have three years or less before their earliest release date to be assigned to the program . Wallkill is their last or next-to-last place of incarceration before parole . <p> At Wallkill , amid meadows strewn with clover and dandelion and the looming guard tower of the Shawangunk Correctional Facility , an adjacent maximum-security prison , men who had never seen a horse now feed and wash Quick Call , a well-mannered Saratoga favorite who won at least one race two hours north of Wallkill every year from 1987 through 1990 . In 86 starts , he won 16 races and earned $807,817 . <p> " Yo , Quick got to be tired of all this fame , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the horse is led . " We did Reader 's Digest last week . " Mr. Parker , who is serving time for an attempted robbery conviction , walked the horse toward a burbling hose on a humid , sticky afternoon , stroking Quick Call 's chin . " If you never make a million in life , at least you can stand next to a million , " he said . <p> Promised Road , the first horse rescued by the foundation in 1984 , is still at Wallkill  --  a gentle , regal bay at 27 years old . <p> Klabin 's Gold , son of Strike the Gold and Splendid Launch , resides up the hill . Few horses represent the unseemly side of the industry more than he does . Klabin 's Gold was found 100 pounds underweight with three fractured legs in December in his stall at Suffolk Downs , a minor track in Boston . His hooves were so long that the horseshoes had imbedded themselves in the bottom of his feet . <p> " When the farrier came to take the shoes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal shape , " said Diana Pikulski , executive director of the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation . <p> None of the prisoners knew of Klabin 's Gold 's past , just as the horse has no conception of the inmates ' past . <p> " Neither of them care , " Mr. Tremper said . <p> Klabin 's Gold had won the 1998 Hirsch Jacobs Stakes at Pimlico and ended up with career earnings of $346,179 . In 55 starts , he won 11 times , finished second 13 times and finished third 7 times . He last raced in March 2002 , finishing last of seven in a $6,250 claimer . <p> His story is like most of the horses here who stopped winning , placing or showing . <p> Banker 's Jet , who earned close to $1 million , was found standing up to his knees in manure at a riding ranch in upstate New York before he was rescued and found a better life in a pasture of inmates . <p> Concerns about the fate of retired thoroughbreds grew last month when it was reported that Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classic champion , was slaughtered last year in Japan , where his carcass was most likely used for pet food . <p> Exceller met a similar end . He outran Affirmed and Seattle Slew to win the 1978 Jockey Club Gold Cup , becoming the only horse to defeat two Triple Crown winners . But after a failed breeding career , Exceller was killed in 1997 and sold for horse meat in Sweden . <p> In 2002 , a federal bill that would ban the sale , transportation and slaughter of horses for human consumption was introduced in the House of Representatives . The bill has been assigned to an Agriculture Committee subcommittee , where it remains under consideration . <p> According to the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation , the number of horses of all breeds slaughtered in the United States has been steadily declining for more than a decade  --  from nearly 350,000 in the late 1980 's to about 60,000 in 2001 , the last year for which figures are available . But the federal government keeps no records of equine abuse . <p> " Nobody in this business wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic low point at these smaller tracks and fairs , " Ms. Pikulski said . " In the case of Klabin 's Gold , the fact that the guy held on to the horse so that we could take the horse from him is to his credit . " <p> About 30,000 thoroughbreds are born each year , but the racing industry does not keep an accurate count of horses retired . The foundation estimates the number to be 3,000 to 5,000 in any given year . Only the famous are likely to get comfortable retirements . <p> " John Henry and any horse that made someone $6 million are fine on some farm in Kentucky , " Mr. Tremper said . " Do they have a horse that made $140 ? They 're not going to take any old cripples that do n't race anymore . " <p> Wallkill 's facade looks more like a gothic monastery than a prison . Eleanor Roosevelt , with the help of an architect , designed the prison , which was completed in 1932 . Canada geese , fox and pheasant were its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation was founded by Monique Koehler , who owned an advertising agency in New York before moving it to New Jersey . She persuaded the breeders and owners of Secretariat , Kelso and Forego to contribute to a fund for less-fortunate retired thoroughbreds . Seed money came from a $200,000 fund-raiser at Belmont Park in 1983 . <p> When the foundation began looking to buy land , Ms. Koehler learned that prison systems owned thousands of lush and sometimes unused acres . From there , the marriage of inmates and retired racehorses seemed perfect : rundown souls in need of a second chance . <p> The foundation also has partnerships with the Blackburn Correctional Facility in Lexington , Ky. , and the Marion County Correctional Institution in Lowell , Fla . <p> The inmates in the program at Wallkill earn 95 cents a day  --  or $9.50 every two weeks  --  to take care of the thoroughbreds . Inmates working Wallkill 's dairy farm , which produces milk for the prison , can make up to $65 every two weeks  --  and that rankles those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work at racetracks and a few went to private stables , Mr. Tremper said . <p> Mr. Tremper said he had not had many problems with inmates in the program , although he said two squared off with pitchforks several years ago . Most of the time , he sees connections made that he was not sure were possible in this environment . Most of the inmates who care for the horses are from the inner cities . <p> Mr. Silva stood in a pasture Wednesday afternoon , massaging iodine shampoo into the infected hoof of Extended Forecast , a horse with one victory in his career . He and other inmates gently bandaged the horse . <p> Mr. Silva said he used to be a drinker who had no control over his rage . About 6 a.m. one day in 1981 , after he had been up all night drinking , Mr. Silva said , he fired at least three shots into an unarmed man waiting for a liquor store to open . Mr. Silva said the man kept fidgeting and reaching into his pocket , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " That was 22 years ago , " Mr. Silva said . " I look back , I wish he would 've shot me . " <p> Now he is 66 . The young man whose life was drowning in alcohol is now an elderly man stroking the underbelly of a horse . <p> When Creme de le Fete was near the end , with a tumor in his thyroid , Mr. Silva spent more time with the horse . " I used to take him out , bathe him , whatever he needed , " Mr. Silva said . " I knew he knew me . I still miss him . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
