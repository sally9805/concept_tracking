ALL THE explanations have sunk in . Enlarged heart . Went out doing what she loved . It was her time . But here 's one thing Shannon Veal 's parents ca n't figure . They 'd videotaped dozens of her games over the years , and on Feb. 18 her father had the same camcorder charged and ready . But when he hit the button ? Nothing . Gilbert kept trying throughout the first quarter , but the damn thing would n't work . Never happened before . Maybe it 's as his wife , Adrianne , says  --  some images are n't meant to be preserved . Gilbert has his own theory : You do n't really see a game when you 're taping it . And on this night , in the Glen Oaks High gym in Baton Rouge , he was meant to see every last moment . // " I actually watched , " Gilbert says . " That 's what wakes me up at night . She just crumpled . " // At age 10 , Shannon Veal discovered that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was arcing three-pointers like skyrockets despite fingers pinpricked by constant blood checks . The 5 ' 8 " junior point guard had emerged as a prime talent , poised to lead the Panthers to their third straight Class 4A title . With Glen Oaks up by 14 in a regional playoff against Helen Cox High , coaches from Shannon 's beloved LSU sat scouting her for the first time . She had just hit a free throw for her 13th point when , with 1:34 left in the second quarter , she signaled to coach Harold Boudreaux for a substitute . She backpedaled downcourt , slapped at her leg , then dropped . Her head hit the floor . Her body convulsed , her eyes rolled . // It was just past 6:30 p.m . Hearing by phone about Shannon 's collapse , former Glen Oaks coach Janice Charles crashed into another car while racing to the school . Upon receiving a second call , Charles started wailing in the middle of the street . Playoff games were under way around the state , and from parish to parish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veal was dead . Across town at Capitol Pre-College and St. Michael the Archangel , down at Ellender Memorial High in Houma , unaware players sat in halftime meetings as coaches jabbered , bewildered by all the cellphones vibrating behind locker doors . Shannon 's teammates were staggered , of course . But girls who had lost to her and been burned by her broke down too , and asked , Why ? // " Everybody loved Shannon , " says Capitol center Dominique Robinson . " She did n't get in arguments . She 'd say ' Chill out ' to her teammates and still come over and talk to us . She talked to anybody . That 's who she was . " // Shannon 's devotion to basketball was total ; it informed her diet , her study habits , her selflessness . She hugged her teachers every day . She admonished her dad for mentioning one of her awards to reporters because " that sounds like bragging . " Charles recalls having been an " ugly " homophobe , warning Shannon to stay away from gay players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still friends with girls like that , " Charles says . " Shannon made me realize I had to let go of this ignorant , prejudiced view . " // After Shannon scored 29 points to beat Iota High on Feb. 2 , she was named MVP of the Hall of Fame Classic . No rival resented it . " I gave her mom a big hug , " says St. Michael center Carol Lee Constantin . " I was proud of Shannon because she worked so hard . She played from her heart . " // That 's the killer irony , of course . Shannon died of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( SI , Dec. 10 , 2007 ) , an excessive thickening of the walls of the heart . About 18 months ago Shannon 's doctor examined her , heard a heart murmur and had her undergo an electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram  --  the tests most likely to flag HCM . Like the camcorder , this technology failed the Veals . " Nothing showed , " Adrianne says . // Less than two hours after her fellow co-captain died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to finish this year for Shannon . " The next night the Panthers won the suspended game against Helen Cox 67 -- 40 ; at the Glen Oaks gym afterward , a Cox player prayed , " Please help this team go all the way . " The Panthers won again to earn a place in the semifinals , then went to the funeral . Shannon 's parents expected 2,000 people . Some 7,500 showed up . // By the time Glen Oaks got to Hammond , La. , last Thursday for the Top 28 Tournament , the players believed they would take the title . They gathered in a parking lot beforehand and giggled and practiced wild handshakes , teenage girls carousing in the fading light . Even Lauren Veal , Shannon 's little sister , was back in uniform , cleared by heart tests two days before . // St. Michael overwhelmed Glen Oaks early , winning 61 -- 47 . It was , in a sense , the ultimate tribute to Shannon : Her team could n't compete without her . All week Boudreaux had insisted that she was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a spark , a miracle : Damn , Shannon . Give me something . Please . But she was gone . // TALK BACK If you have a comment about Shannon Veal or HCM , send it to **25;122;TOOLONG
