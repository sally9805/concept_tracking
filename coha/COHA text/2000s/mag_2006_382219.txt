My phone rang at 3 A.M. the other day . As calls at that hour go , it was n't so terrible . No one I know had been rushed to the hospital . This was an emergency of another sort : my credit was under attack , and I needed to act fast . <P> Someone had tried to wire $400 from my MasterCard to an account in Bosnia . The transaction raised red flags at Western Union , which refused the transfer . Still , I was advised to shut down my credit card immediately . I called my bank , which had already taken that step  --  though not before nearly $2,000 in fraudulent charges had been put through in the hours since I had gone to bed .
