Jon Else is a documentary filmmaker , who has been very successful in spreading his art . He is a teacher of other filmmakers and , as a teacher myself , I envy the loyalty and admiration he has built in his students . ( I met , by accident , two of his students at a dinner party . He was their god. ) // Else worked on a documentary that I was involved with . At a break , he told me a story about the freedom to create with film in America today . // In 1990 , Else was working on a documentary about Wagner 's Ring Cycle , and the story was to be told by the stagehands at the San Francisco Opera . Stagehands are a particularly funny and colorful aspect of opera . During a show , they hang out below the stage in the grips ' lounge and in the lighting loft . They are a perfect contrast to the art on the stage . // In the course of one of these performances , Else was shooting some stagehands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a television set . Playing on the television set , as the stagehands played checkers , as the San Francisco Opera played Wagner , was The Simpsons . And as Else judged it , this touch helped capture the oddness of the scene . // Years later , when he finally got funding to complete the film , Else attempted to clear the rights for those few seconds of The Simpsons . Of course , those few seconds are copyrighted and , of course , to use copyrighted material you need the permission of the copyright owner . // Else knows Matt Groening , so he called Groening 's office to get permission . Groening said , " Sure , use the shot . " The shot was a four-and-a-half-second image on a tiny television set in the corner of the room . How could it hurt ? Groening was happy to have it in the film , but he told Else to contact Gracie Films , the company that produced The Simpsons . // Gracie Films was okay with it , too , but they , like Groening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Else to contact Fox , Gracie 's parent company . So Else called Fox and told them about the film and told them about the four-and-a-half-second clip in the corner of the one shot . Matt Groening had already given permission , Else said . He was just confirming the permission with Fox . // Then , as Else told me , " two things happened . First we discovered ... that Matt Groening does n't own his own creation-or at least that someone at Fox believes he does n't own his own creation . " And second , Fox " wanted ten thousand dollars as a licensing fee for us to use this four and a half seconds of ... entirely unsolicited Simpsons , which was in the corner of the shot . " // Else was certain there was a mistake . He worked his way up to the someone he thought was a vice president for licensing , Rebecca Herrera . And he said to her , " There must be some mistake here .... We 're asking for your educational rate on this . " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so later , Else called again to confirm what he had been told . // " I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight , " he told me he told her . " Yes , you have your facts straight , " she said . Ten thousand dollars to use the clip of The Simpsons in the corner of a short in a documentary film about Wagner 's Ring Cycle . And then , astonishingly , Herrera told Else , " And if you quote me , I 'll turn you over to our attorneys . " As an assistant to Herrera told Else later on , " They do n't give a shit . They just want the money . " // Else did n't have the money to buy the right to replay what was playing on the television backstage at the San Francisco Opera . To repeat that reality was beyond the documentary filmmaker 's budget . And thus , at the very last minute before the film was to be released , Else digitally replaced the four and a half seconds of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-The Day After Trinity . Only problem was that when Else shot the sequence at the San Francisco Opera in 1990 , The Day After Trinity had not yet been made . // We live in a free society-built between the bulwarks of free speech and the prosperity of a free market . Yet the culture of that culture-once a free culture-is changing . We are moving from this free culture , where artists and creators and critics could build easily upon our past , to a permission culture , where the right to use what is all around us depends upon the permission of an increasingly small few . // This is a profound change in our culture . It is the product of changing law and changing technology . Unless it is reversed , it will remake who we are and how we build our culture . // ( Continues ... ) //
