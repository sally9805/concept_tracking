It all started one day earlier with a single silenced bullet out of nowhere . Thomas Hunter was walking down the same dimly lit alley he always took on his way home after locking up the small Java Hut on Colfax and Ninth , when a smack ! punctuated the hum of distant traffic . Red brick dribbled from a one-inch hole two feet away from his face . He stopped midstride . Smack ! This time he saw the bullet plow into the brick . This time he felt a sting on his cheek as tiny bits of shattered brick burst from the impact . This time every muscle in his body ceased . Someone had just shot at him ! Was shooting at him . Tom recoiled to a crouch and instinctively spread his arms . He could n't seem to tear his eyes off those two holes in the brick , dead ahead . They had to be some mistake . Figments of his overactive imagination . His aspirations to write novels had finally ruptured the line between fantasy and reality with these two empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thomas Hunter ! " That was n't his imagination , was it ? No , that was his name , and it was echoing down the alley . A third bullet crashed into the brick wall . He bolted to his left , still crouching . One long step , drop the right shoulder , roll . Again the air split above his head . This bullet clanged into a steel ladder and rang down the alley . Tom came to his feet and chased the sound in a full sprint , pushed by instinct as much as by terror . He 'd been here before , in the back alleys of Manila . He 'd been a teenager then , and the Filipino gangs were armed with knives and machetes rather than guns , but at the moment , tearing down the alley behind Ninth and Colfax , Tom 's mind wasn'tdrawing any distinction . " You 're a dead man ! " the voice yelled . Now he knew who they were . They were from New York . This alley led to another thirty yards ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , but he knew the cutaway . Two more bullets whipped by , one so close he could feel its wind on his left ear . Feet pounded the concrete behind him . Two , maybe three pairs . Tom dived into the shadow . " Cut him off in the back . Radio . " Tom rolled to the balls of his feet then sprinted , mind spinning . Radio ? The problem with adrenaline , Makatsu 's thin voice whispered , is that it makes your head weak . His karate instructor would point to his head and wink . You have plenty of muscle to fight , but no muscle to think . If they had radios and could cut off the street ahead , he would have a very serious problem . He looked frantically for cover . One access to the roof halfway down the alley . One large garbage bin too far away . Scattered boxes to his left . No real cover . He had to make his move before they entered the alley . Fingers of panic stabbed into his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom had once been beaten to a pulp by a gang of Filipinos who 'd taken a pledge to kill any Americano brat who entered their turf . They made the streets around the army base their turf . His instructor had scolded him , insisting that he was good enough to have escaped their attack that afternoon . His panic had cost him dearly . His brain had been turned to rice pudding , and he deserved the bruises that swelled his eyes shut . This time it was bullets , not feet and clubs , and bullets would leave more than bruises . Time was out . Short on ideas and long on desperation , Tom dived for the gutter . Rough concrete tore at his skin . He rolled quickly to his left , bumped into the brick wall , and lay facedown in the deep shadow . Feet pounded around the corner and ran straight toward him . One man . How they had found him in Denver , four years after the fact , he had no clue . But if they 'd gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man ran on light feet , hardly winded . Tom 's nose was buried in the musty corner . Noisy blasts of air from his nostrils buffeted his face . He clamped down on his breathing ; immediately his lungs began to burn . The slapping feet approached , ran past . Stopped . A slight tremor lit through his bones . He fought another round of panic . It had been six years since his last fight . He did n't stand a chance against a man with a gun . He desperately willed the feet to move on . Walk . Just walk ! But the feet did n't walk . They scraped quietly . Tom nearly cried out in his hopelessness . He had to move now , while he still had the advantage of surprise . He threw himself to his left , rolled once to gain momentum . Then twice , rising first to his knees then to his feet . His attacker was facing him , gun extended , frozen . Tom 's momentum carried him laterally , directly toward the opposite wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit a bullet past him . But now instinct had replaced panic . What shoes am I wearing ? The question flashed through Tom 's mind as he hurdled for the brick wall , left foot leading . A critical question . His answer came when his foot planted on the wall . Rubber soles . One more step up the wall with traction to spare . He threw his head back , arched hard , pushed himself off the brick , then twisted to his right halfway through his rotation . The move was simply an inverted bicycle kick , but he had n't executed it in half a dozen years , and this time his eyes were n't on a soccer ball tossed up by one of his Filipino friends in Manila . This time it was a gun . The man managed one shot before Tom 's left foot smashed into his hand , sending the pistol clattering down the alley . The bullet tugged at his collar . Tom did n't land lightly on his feet as he 'd hoped . He sprawled to his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite a well-muscled man with short-cropped black hair . Not exactly a perfectly executed maneuver . Not terrible for someone who had n't fought in six years . The man 's eyes were round with shock . His experience in the martial arts obviously did n't extend beyond The Matrix . Tom was briefly tempted to shout for joy , but , if anything , he had to shut this man up before he could call out . The man 's astonishment suddenly changed to a snarl , and Tom saw the knife in his right hand . Okay , so maybe the man knew more about street-fighting than was at first apparent . He charged Tom . The fury that flooded Tom 's veins felt all too welcome . How dare this man shoot at him ! How dare he not fall to his knees after such a brilliant kick ! Tom ducked the knife 's first swipe . Came up with his palm to the man 's chin . Bone cracked . It was n't enough . This man was twice his weight , with twice his muscle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertically and spun into a full roundhouse kick , screaming despite his better judgment . His foot had to be doing a good eighty miles an hour when it struck the man 's jaw . They both hit the concrete at precisely the same time-Tom on his feet , ready to deliver another blow ; his assailant on his back , breathing hard , ready for the grave . Figuratively speaking . The man 's silver pistol lay near the wall . Tom took a step for it , then rejected the notion . What was he going to do ? Shoot back ? Kill the guy ? Incriminate himself ? Not smart . He turned and ran back in the direction they 'd come . The main alley was empty . He ducked into it , edged along the wall , grabbed the rails to a steel fire escape , and quickly ascended . The building 's roof was flat and shouldered another taller building to the south . He swung up to the second building , ran in a crouch , and halted by a large vent , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the New Yorker . He dropped to his knees , pressed back into the shadows , and listened past the thumping of his heart . The hum of a million tires rolling over asphalt . The distant roar of a jet overhead . The faint sound of idle talk . The sizzling of food frying in a pan , or of water being poured from a window . The former , considering they were in Denver , not the Philippines . No sounds from New York . He leaned back and closed his eyes , catching his breath . Crazy ! Fights in Manila as a teenager were one thing , but here in the States at the ripe age of twenty-five ? The whole sequence struck him as surreal . It was hard to believe this had just happened to him . Or , more accurately , was happening to him . He still had to figure a way out of this mess . Did they know where he lived ? No one had followed him to the roof . Tom crept to the ledge . Another alley ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver 's brilliant skyline glimmered on the horizon directly ahead . An odd odor met his nose , sweet like cotton candy but mixed with rubber or something burning . Deja vu . He 'd been here before , had n't he ? No , of course not . Lights shimmered in the hot summer air , reds and yellows and blues , like jewels sprinkled from heaven . He could swear he 'd been-Tom 's head suddenly snapped to the left . He threw out his arms , but his world spun impossibly and he knew that he was in trouble . Something had hit him . Something like a sledgehammer . Something like a bullet . He felt himself topple , but he was n't sure if he was really falling or if he was losing consciousness . Something was horribly wrong with his head . He landed hard on his back , in a pillow of black that swallowed his mind whole . Chapter Two the man 's eyes snapped open . A pitch-black sky above . No lights , no stars , no buildings . Only black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember where he was . Who he was . But all he could remember was that he 'd just had a vivid dream . He closed his eyes and fought to wake . He 'd dreamed that he was running from some men who wanted to hurt him . He 'd escaped like a spider up a wall after leveling one of the men . Then he 'd stared out at the lights . Such beautiful , brilliant lights . Now he was awake . And he still did n't know where he was . He sat up , disoriented . The shadows of tall , dark trees surrounded a rocky clearing in which he 'd been sleeping . His eyes began to adjust to the darkness , and he saw a field of some kind ahead . He clambered to his feet and steadied himself . On his feet , leather moccasins . On his body , dark pants , tan suede shirt with two pockets . He instinctively felt for his left temple , where a sharp ache throbbed . Warm . Wet . His fingers came away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something had plowed into his head . He turned and saw a dark patch glistening on the rock where he 'd fallen . He must have struck his head against the rock and been knocked un-conscious . But he could n't remember anything but the dream . He was n't in a city . He was n't anywhere near a dark alley or traffic or guns . Instead he was here , in a rocky clearing , surrounded by large trees . But where ? Maybe the knock to his head had given him amnesia . What was his name ? Thomas . The man in his dream had called him Thomas Hunter . Tom Hunter . Tom felt the bleeding bump on his head again . The surface wound above his ear had matted his hair with blood . It had knocked him senseless , but thankfully no more . The night was actually quite bright now . In fact , he could make the trees out clearly . He lowered his hand and stared at a tree without full comprehension . Square branches jutted off from the trunk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claws grasping at the heavens . The smooth bark looked as though it might be made of metal or a carbon fiber rather than organic material . Did he know these trees ? Why did this sight disturb him ? " It looks perfectly good . " Tom jumped and spun to the male voice . " Huh ? " A man , a redhead dressed like him , stood looking down at a cluster of rocks ten feet away . Did . . . did he know this man ? " The water looks clean to me , " the man said . Tom swallowed . " What 's . . . what happened ? " He followed the man 's eyes and saw that he was staring at a small puddle of water nestled in a boulder at the edge of the clearing . There was something strange about the water , but he could n't put his finger on it . " I think we should try it . Looks good , " the man said . " Where are we ? " Tom asked . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted his head and grinned . " You really do n't remember ? What , you get knocked in the head or something ? " " I guess I must have . I honestly ca n't remember a thing . " " What 's your name ? " " Tom . I think . " " Well , you know that much . Now all we have to do is find a way out of here . " " And what 's your name ? " Tom asked . " Seriously ? You do n't remember ? " The man was staring at the water again . " No . " " Bill , " the man said absently . He reached down and touched the water . Brought it to his nose and sniffed . His eyes closed as he savored the scent . Tom glanced around the clearing , willing his mind to remember . Odd how he could remember some things but not others . He knew that these tall black things were called trees , that the material on his body was called clothing , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even knew that this kind of selective memory loss was consistent with amnesia . But he could n't remember any history . Could n't remember how he got here . Did n't know why Bill was so mesmerized by the water . Did n't even know who Bill was . " I had a dream about being chased down an alley , " Tom said . " Is that how we got here ? " " If only it were that simple . I dreamed of Lucy Lane last night-if only she really did have an obsession over me . " He grinned . Tom closed his eyes , rubbed his temples , paced , and then faced Bill again , desperate for some sense of familiarity . " So where are we ? " " This water smells absolutely delicious . We need to drink , Tom . How long has it been since we had water ? " Bill was looking at the liquid on his finger . That was another thing Tom knew : They should n't drink the water . But Bill seemed to be considering it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snicker sounded in the night . Tom scanned the trees . " You hear that ? " " Are we hearing things now ? " Bill asked . " No . Yes ! That was a snicker . Something 's out there ! " " Nope . You 're hearing things . " Bill dipped three fingers into the water . This time he lifted them above his mouth and let a drop fall on his tongue . The effects were immediate . He gasped and stared at his wet finger with a look of horror . Slowly his mouth twisted into a smile . He stuffed his fingers into his mouth and sucked with such relief , such rapture , that Tom thought he 'd lost his mind on the spot . Bill suddenly dropped to his knees and plopped his face into the small pool of water . He drank , like a horse from a trough , sucking down the water in long , noisy pulls . Then he stood , trembling , licking his lips . " Bill ? " " What ? " " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you idiot . What does it look like I 'm doing , backflips ? Are you that- " He caught himself midsentence and turned away . His fingers crept across the rock into the water , and he sampled the liquid again in a way that made Tom think he was intentionally being sneaky . This man named Bill , whom he supposedly knew , had flipped his lid completely . " You have to try the water , Tom . You absolutely have to try the water . " Then , without another word , Bill hopped over the rock , walked into the black forest , and was gone . " Bill ? " Tom peered into the night where Bill had disappeared . Should he follow ? He ran forward and pulled up by the boulder . " Bill ! " Nothing . Tom took three long steps forward , planted his left hand on the rock , and vaulted in pursuit . A chill flashed up his arm . He glanced down , midvault , and saw that his index finger rested in the puddle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current ran up his arm , over his shoulder , straight to his spine . The base of his skull buzzed with intense pleasure , pulling him to the water , begging him to plunge his head into this pool . Then his foot landed beyond the rock and another reality jerked him from the water . Pain . The intense searing pain of a blade slicing through his leather moccasins and into his heel . Tom gasped and dived headlong into the field past the boulder . The instant his outstretched hands made contact with the ground , pain shot up his arms and he knew he had made a dreadful mistake . Nausea swept through his body . Razor-sharp shale sliced through his flesh as though it were butter . He recoiled , shuddering as the shale pulled free from deep cuts in his forearms . Tom groaned and fought to retain consciousness . Pinpricks of light swam in his clenched eyes . High above , a million leaves rustled in the night breeze . The snickers of a thousand-Tom 's eyes snapped open . Snickers ? His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't alone . From a branch not five feet above him hung a large , lumpy growth the length of his arm . Next to the growth hung another , like a cluster of black grapes . If he had n't fallen , he might have hit his head on the clumps . The growth nearest him suddenly moved . Tom blinked . Two wings unfolded from the growth . A triangular face tilted toward him , exposing pupil-less eyes . Large , red , pupil-less eyes . A thin pink tongue snaked out of black lips and tested the air . Tom 's heart crashed into his throat . He jerked his eyes to the other growths . A thousand black creatures clung to the branches surrounding him , peering at him with red eyes too large for their angular faces . The bat closest to him curled its lips to expose dirty yellow fangs . Tom screamed . His world washed with blackness .
