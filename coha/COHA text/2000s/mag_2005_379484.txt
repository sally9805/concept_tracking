Football is considered the unofficial religion of Texas . So it should n't be a surprise that when it comes to temple construction , the Dallas Cowboys tend to get their way . Bucking a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on eminent domain that curtailed private-property rights , the Texas legislature passed a bill in August that would restrict government seizures of private land ( thus joining several states in a backlash against the ruling ) . But two exemptions made it into the bill , one involving the Cowboys ' construction plans for a new $650 million stadium . About 50 property owners are refusing to sell their homes to the city of Arlington , blocking the Cowboys ' bid to build the stadium on their land . If the bill becomes law , those homeowners may be forced to leave , suggesting that the property-rights movement is alive and well in Texas  --  so long as football revenues are n't at stake . Says Glen Heath , 84 , who has lived in his Arlington home since 1949 and may now have to vacate : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll go out of my way to watch them now .
