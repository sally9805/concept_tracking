/Jan 2006 Have you ever helped someone cross a street , brought an ill friend some homemade soup , or picked up grocedes for a neighbor ? If so , you have participated in an act that makes any society human and humane . Helping others takes you down a path that is enriching and satisfying . When the occasional helping hand turns into a regular commitment , then you have become a full-fledged volunteer . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , a volunteer is " a person who freely offers to do something . " These days it 's even hip to volunteer . Celebrities promote a range of causes from environmental to political . Community service requirements in high school and college are common . Volunteer work has far-reaching benefits for both the giver and receiver as seen by the impressive response to our request for your volunteer stories in the June-July 2005 issue of InsideMS . Photograph No junk food snacks here . Mary Boccaccio 's after-school nutrition class is always a surprising treat . // An overview People with MS are active all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing community festivals to cooking lunch at a senior center . Some people listed one activity ; others cited more than five . They volunteer for a few hours , once a week , every day , weekly , or annually . Many volunteer for their Society chapter , working in the lending library , facilitating self-help groups , and helping with chapter events . Over and over , people told us how their volunteer work gives purpose to life , keeps them connected to others , and helps them feel better , physically and emotionally . Starting from despair Someone with MS comes to volunteer for unique reasons . According to a pilot study on volunteers with disabilities by Katherine Caldwell and Michael Wiegand , Philadelphia University , School of Science and Health , " Because of a disability , individuals often experience a role loss . " Jessica Howland , a former psychotherapist , expressed this succinctly . " My job had been so much a part of me . I no longer had a sense of contributing . I could n't answer the question most people ask when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " Donald Mulvaney also grieved over the loss of his active career as a doctor . " But as time passed , I became more focused on what I can do rather than what I can not do , " he said . As difficult as it is , Rowland , like Dr. Mulvaney , found a toehold on the slippery slope of an MS diagnosis . Howland asked herself what she felt passionate about . She had always loved the ocean and had moved near the shore before her diagnosis . She now volunteers as a guide , talking to visitors at a nearby marine sanctuary . " This work keeps me learning new things and has led me to other projects , such as taking part in fish surveys . I feel I 'm helping to save a little part of my corner of the world . " Putting your work to work Many people start by doing what they know best . Debbie Reaves was a teacher and " knew I wanted to continue being involved with kids . " So she joined her county 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for abused and neglected children within the child welfare system . She visits children , attends school meetings , consuits with foster parents and social workers , and reports on the children 's progress at Juvenile Court . Other former teachers go back to schools and help out in learning centers , reading to children or tutoring math and writing . Some lead youth groups such as the Girl Scouts or the 4-H Club . Former school counselors can be found facilitating MS self-help groups . The Traveler 's Aid Society is a great place for a woman who worked in sales and loves the public . People who worked in health care volunteer at health fairs , teach classes at health centers , and lead support groups . As for people who worked in offices , many find a welcome mat for their computer skills . Doing something completely different People also go on to new things . Since retiring from office administration , Pat Winters works with adults who , often after many years , are now working toward their GEDs . " Many of my students have learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help can make a big difference . I think because I use a cane and can only process information well for one to two hours , I have an extra connection with some of the students . " Photograph At home , Mary prepares a variety of food and flavors for her classes . // Some organizations provide terrific training for their volunteers , especially for those who want to serve as guides at historical sites , museums , zoos , and nature centers . Mary Boccaccio was a manuscript curator in a university library . After taking a nutrition course at a local university , she now volunteers at an after-school program teaching kids about food and nutrition . " At first the kids are leery , but they try absolutely everything . And I enjoy cooking , anyway . " Finding the unexpected Sometimes one activity leads to another . Bernice Pierce taught herself Web design and started a Web site for singles . While looking for things to do in her area to list on her site , she discovered a community band . Now she plays clarinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive deficits when nothing else seemed to work . " Becoming a leader Then there are people who want to take on leadership roles . David Chaiken still works as a marketing executive despite his worsening progressive MS . When depression hit , Chaiken volunteered at a nursing home . Talking with people and listening to their stories gave him a better perspective on his own situation and led him to become a motivational speaker . He now speaks to MS groups and advocates for people with MS and the Society . Other volunteers serve behind the scenes on boards and committees of community and nonprofit groups , such as credit unions and hospitals . They organize community fairs and toy drives . They run food pantries and coordinate neighborhood yard sales for fundraising purposes . Some coordinate other volunteers . Making accommodations Florence Ford , now 81 , has had MS for 50 years . A former nurse , she had to retire at 58 but still wanted to be active . She contacted her local hospital and volunteered as a patient representative , visiting patients in their rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpeted hallways , so she resigned . The volunteer department soon called to offer her the use of an electric wheelchair so she could continue at the hospital . These days she no longer volunteers , but she still " reaps the benefits of knowing I contributed to something bigger than myself . " Activities often change over time . Phil C. continued to serve as a volunteer firefighter for some years after his MS diagnosis . But now he " rides with the ambulance assisting with rescue calls " and is involved with committee work . Variety is the spice Ann Parkey drives people to their doctor appointments . Her charges are often surprised to find someone who uses a walker arriving to drive them around town . Occasionally she arbitrates for the Better Business Bureau . And if she happens to be at a shopping mall , she is authorized to give parking tickets to ineligible cars in the handicapped parking spots . " I do n't go out of my way to patrol , but I do observe , " she said . People who need people Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dona Thebarge has been an advocate at a rape crisis center for eight years . " My responsibilities include answering the hotline and going to the hospitals with assault victims . When people tell me they feel better because I 'm there for them , that 's an incredible feeling . " Wanda Harding stated that " I often feel very fatigued and ill when I 'm on my way to the Ronald McDonald House . But when I meet with families , I feel better mentally and physically . On some days it gives me the strength to get up and go . " Terri Lynn Vegter feels the same about helping at aquatics classes at her MS center . " When I focus on others , it takes me out of my self-involved world . My pain seems to melt away , or at least it 's overshadowed by my joy in helping others . " Photograph Tuna and artichoke hearts on English muffins bring on camaraderie . // ... and people who need dogs and horses Some people need animals in their lives . Soon after Jerre Morton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been a " puppy socializer " ever since , even though she now has cognitive impairments . " I handle the puppies so they get used to being touched by people . I just love it . They already have personalities at five weeks old . " Janet Werner thought MS had brought an end to her passion for riding hoses . But when her nephew , who is blind and partially deaf , began taking riding lessons at Pal-O-Mine Equestrian Center on Long Island , she saw some possibilities for herself . She trained as a volunteer " sidewalker " and helps young riders who have cerebral palsy , mental retardation , or autism . " I 've seen remarkable progress in the kids I work with . This has given me back something I thought I lost a long time ago . " Nothing too small Although Donald Mulvaney still manages to work as a doctor , he finds that " stuffing envelopes and greeting visitors are rewarding , too . A physician doing secretarial work may sound pathetic , but it allows me to provide a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Michele Rudd can no longer work or drive because of her progressive MS . She had been an active volunteer but now felt it was out of the question . Then she saw a TV news report about an officer in Iraq who noticed that some soldiers never received mail . He started a Web site called AnySoldier.com . Rudd checked it out . " The soldiers were really young , too . I began to write to some of them . " Others volunteer at nursing homes , senior centers , and hospice/respite facilities . As Dawn Goering put it , " All I have to do is listen . That is one thing my MS can not alter . " How people manage Whatever the impact of MS , it is fatigue that people mention most as getting in the way of activities . But by managing time and energy , people are able to do their volunteering . We received these tips : Take it slowly . Dr. Mulvaney now volunteers at a free clinic where he can " work at a slower pace than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a morning , I see 10 or fewer and have the luxury of spending more time with each one . " Power nap . Kimberly Womack still works as a nurse practitioner . When a hurricane devastated their Florida community in September 2004 , she volunteered for kitchen duty in the local disaster recovery center . For four months " fatigue was on me like a wet blanket . I had to balance my hours in the kitchen with power naps and rest . Somehow it all worked . " Plan ahead . Reaves , the courtappointed children 's advocate , said that " as my walking has deteriorated , I always ask about access and parking ahead of time . If the place is not easily accessible , I arrange to participate by telephone . " Choose the time . Pat Winters said of her GED tutoring , " I am productive within hours and conditions I can control . " Sue Boiarsky said , " I volunteer on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I remember what Mondays and Fridays were like when I held a salaried position . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have MS . People sit at information desks , greeting visitors at museums and hospitals . They sit to tutor children and adults and to do various kinds of office work , such as mailings , answering telephones , and data entry . They sit to make reminder phone calls for doctor appointments and serve at health information centers . Even with severe mobility limitations , Michael Cavallo said , " It does not affect my job , as I sit behind a desk at the visitor 's center in Corning , New York , greet visitors and answer the telephone . Fatigue is n't much of a factor , since I work less than three hours and the facility is air-conditioned . " Volunteer from home . Sister Jeanette Kopel narrates books and magazines for the blind from her home . Many telephone and computer tasks can be done at home . People write and edit newsletters at home . They call homebound people , are available for peer support , coordinate committee work , and gather information , all from home . They accommodate their limitations by making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being with others give people a good feeling . But are there actual health benefits ? Recent studies have shown that volunteering can play a real role in increasing a sense of well-being , reducing depression , and even alleviating chronic pain . Peggy A. Thoits , PhD , professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina , and her graduate students compared people who volunteer with those who do n't . The study , published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior ( June 2001 ) , showed that volunteers are more satisfied in their lives , are happier , feel more in control , have less depression and higher self-esteem , and report better physical health than those who do n't volunteer . According to Dr. Thoits , " The more you volunteer , the better you feel . You can be at a lower level of physical health and still improve due to volunteer work . " Another study , reported in the journal Pain Management Nursing ( December 2004 ) , looked at how volunteering affects chronic pain . Paul Arnstein , PhD , RNCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Nursing at Boston College , studied people at his pain clinic who went through a 10-week pain management program and later returned to volunteer at the clinic . " Despite persistent pain issues , volunteers had improved mood , higher degrees of self-efficacy , and were more active and thus had less disability . Over time they reported less pain and had improved function . Now we urge people who ca n't go back to work to volunteer . It restores self-worth and makes for better functioning , " Dr. Arnstein said . Photograph At the end of the day , Trubby gets his nutritional attention . // Whatever the past experience or present ability of a person with MS , volunteering brings a sense of personal usefulness that is empowering .

" - Terri Lynn Vegter Sidebar A word of caution : do n't risk losing disability benefits A former college professor told InsideMS : " I was forced into retirement because I could not do the teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that I could continue to do my research and publishing and to advise my doctoral students , unremunerated . Not so ! My disability insurance prohibits me from engaging in any work-related activities . If I do so , I could lose my disability income and be prosecuted for fraud . " Kimberly Calder , manager of Health Insurance Initiatives at the Society , answered : " If you are receiving disability insurance benefits ( or are considering doing so ) , you are claiming that you are too disabled to do your former job , or even to work at all . The provisions of disability insurance plans are not all the same , so you should check your policy to make sure your volunteer activities will not jeopardize your disability benefits . Speak with your benefits office or your insurance carrier if you are unsure . Ask : ' Are there any restrictions regarding volunteer activities ? ' " And remember , you are always free to find satisfying volunteer opportunities doing something that has no relation to your former work .
