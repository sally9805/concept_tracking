If management is to be adequate , It will be necessary for medical schools to do a better job training physicians and/or recognize that it may be necessary for non-M.D.s to be given the legal right to prescribe , so that they may appropriately take over this role . With pain being such a common problem , one would wonder why more physicians do n't specialize in its treatment . As is often in medicine , it boils down to dollars and cents . // Insurance companies pay poorly for a doctor 's time , unless they are doing a procedure . If one is doing surgery or a heart catheterization , for example , or even setting a broken bone , s/he will be paid handsomely . If , on the other hand , the doctor is predominantly spending time listening , data-gathering or doing an examination so that s/he can make a proper diagnosis , the insurance company will often pay less than the physician 's overhead . Basically , the insurance companies pay for the average eight-minute doctor visit . If the doctor spends more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or testing that s/he gets reimbursed for , the doctor is likely going to lose money . The evaluation of pain is a complex and time-consuming process . For reasons that escape me , insurance companies by and large will also not pay for time spent doing simple yet highly effective pain management procedures such as trigger point injections or stretch and spray . By not paying adequately for safe and effective procedures , more and more patients are forced into surgery , medications or nerve blocks which are often far more expensive , riskier and less effective . If you have a physician who spends the time needed to take a proper history and do a proper examination and who has taken the time to learn trigger point injections and/or stretch and spray and uses these techniques , it is unlikely that s/he will be able to stay in business if s/he accepts what your insurance company pays as payment in full . In addition to being poorly reimbursed by insurance companies , pain specialists are often faced with patients who require narcotics for severe and chronic pain . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened with the loss of their license and are sometimes even arrested for the appropriate prescribing of these medications . This is the risk faced by pain specialists every time they prescribe a narcotic medication-no matter how appropriately it is given . This causes major problems for pain doctors , pharmacists and suffering patients . In a front-page article in the Washington Post , Attorney General John Ashcroft was quoted as saying that arrests of pain specialists who prescribe Oxycontin show " our commitment to bring to justice all those who traffic in this very dangerous drug . " The doctor is presumed guilty until proven innocent and is often judged by people who are incredibly hostile to the use of narcotics in chronic pain patients . In the same article , Russell Portenoy , a pain specialist at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York , who is considered one of the fathers of modern pain management , notes " 15 years of progress in treating patients in chronic pain could really be wiped away if these prosecutions continue . . . treating people in pain is n't easy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening now is that the medical ambiguity is being turned into allegations of criminal behavior . We have to draw a line in the sand here , or else the treatment will be lost , and millions of patients will suffer . " In the same article , Rebecca Patchin , a pain specialist who is a board member of the AMA , notes that an estimated 50 million Americans live with chronic pain . She says that almost half of all Americans will seek care for persistent pain sometime during their lives , but that many will not receive the treatment they need . She notes that " Doctors hear what 's happening to other physicians . . . and that makes them very reluctant to prescribe opiates that patients might well need . Unfortunately , it will not be doctors who get these misguided laws changed . The doctors attempting to get the laws changed can make themselves targets for those who would take away their medical licenses . It will come only when patients make it clear to their senators and representatives ( and the president ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated like drug addicts . Otherwise , many government officials seem to live by the saying that " all pain is tolerable-as long as it is somebody else 's . " We live in a democracy-be heard , be clear , and make your vote count . The article in the Washington Post mentions a group called the " Pain Relief Network " ( see **25;2456;TOOLONG ) that is fighting for your right to be pain free . The good news is that the large majority of patients with pain can become pain free without narcotics by using the principles in my book. * Although I recommend that you make your voice heard , I would direct most of your energy into getting your life back . You can do this now , without waiting for the government to act . Things are already starting to change . Doctors are interested in learning more about pain management . For example , a survey of 247 physicians from various specialties showed that 96 percent were dissatisfied with the training they received in medical school about opiates and 84 percent were dissatisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent pain , 82 percent of providers were uncomfortable prescribing opiates for more than three months ; 42 percent said they were not prescribing opiates properly and 34 percent were not sure whether they were properly prescribing them . Nearly all ( 94 percent ) said that further courses in opioid management would help them in their practices . The relationship between prescription and natural medicine Standard allopathic medicine , which focuses predominantly on prescriptions and surgery , offers powerful new techniques that fall outside of what is found in nature . Because they are tailored to specifically suppress certain reactions in the body , they can at times be more powerful than natural medicines . Experience shows , however , that they are also far more likely to be toxic . As the pharmaceutical industry is driven largely by financial motivations ( this is not necessarily a bad thingsimply how our capitalist system is structured ) , the ability of a prescription to make money is usually the predominant driving force . Although physicians are well meaning , they sometimes attempt to make sure that anyone who is a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also simply ignore any scientific data that does not fit their belief system . But ca n't we rely on the results of scientific studies ? I wish this were always so . Unfortunately , both clinical experience and research has shown that " troubling financial links between pharmaceutical firms and academic scientists are pervasive and may impact the research process . " In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , researchers led by Yale 's Gary Cross found that industry funding makes it 3.6 times more likely that a study result will be favorable to the sponsor . What makes this interesting is that many doctors and academics would not dream of publishing or relying on a study that is not placebo-controlled , because this increases the chance of positive outcome by 30 percent . On the other hand , that the drug companies ' paying for a study increases the chance of a positive outcome by 360 percent does not seem to affect whether they will rely on or publish that study . The Yale study also showed that one quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are studying , while approximately two thirds of the schools have financial ties . That the study is paid for by the drug company can affect results in a number of ways . For example , as a physician , I have often seen study designs that markedly favor the sponsor 's drug . They would use the proper dose of the sponsor 's drug , but too low a dose of the competitor 's drugs . In addition , if the study does not give a favorable outcome , the company will not allow the data to be published and journals are less likely to publish studies showing a negative outcome because this is considered boring or less important . The exception to this is that they are happy to publish studies that reflect negatively on natural remedies , no matter how poorly the study was done , yet are often unwilling to publish studies that show a positive effect from natural therapies . The Center for Science in the Public Interest says , " There is a lot of idealism about how science is isolated and objective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely influence scientists . " In addition , despite the heavy biases of studies that are paid for by the drug companies , the FDA still uses that data in assessing whether a drug will be approved , as drug companies funded nearly 60 percent of medical research in the United States ( spending over $30 billion last year ) . In addition to spending an enormous amount on television and other advertising , they have enormous clout with both the medical and media establishments . Basically , upsetting them by saying anything bad about them can be a very expensive mistake . As a medical journal editor , one tries very hard to maintain objectivity . This is one reason for my policy of not taking money from any company whose products I recommend ( or for that matter , from any company ) . So why does it seem like there 's a conflict between the two systems ? Medicine is evolving . When I was in medical school in the early jos , the focus of treatment was on how to poison one body system to bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that brings serotonin back into the cell to be stored , thus raising serotonin levels outside of the cell . But Prozac also causes sexual dysfunction and other side effects in upwards of one-third of the people who use it . Nonetheless , in a society based on economics and quick fixes , the use of prescription medications and surgery moved forward fairly quickly and increasingly squeezed out other branches of the healing arts . . It is worth looking at how things came to be the way they are . This gives us both understanding and the ability to choose where we want to go . In the 1800s there was little research and regulation in the healing arts . The healers and wise women in the tribe would learn what worked from experience and pass on the information to their apprentices in a chain that often spanned thousands of years . As world wars and the expansion of Western civilization began to destroy long-standing social structures around the planet , much of this information and experience was lost . Natural medicine began to enter a period of decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healers/herbalists , accountability was also lost , and we began to see the rise of the " snake oil salesman . " It was in this context that science began to come to the forefront . People longed for something more proven , from groups in which there was accountability . Scientists provided this , using techniques that allowed ideas to be tested , reproduced and validated . Because of the natural competition between them , these ideas initially had to make it through the gauntlet of others ' skepticism before being accepted . Testing and validation began to take hold in the healing arts . As in any system that generates a large amount of money and power , however , financial influences began to have their say . In the early 1900s , research focused on both biophysics ( i.e. , treatments that affected the body 's energy systems ) and biochemistry . Politics being what it is , the biochemists were able to get the upper hand and research and treatment using biophysics was marginalized and suppressed . Seeing which way the winds of change were blowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring biophysics to biochemistry . Medical schools were begun ( which often initially focused on using natural therapies ) , standardized curriculums and tests were developed and it became possible to develop reliable conditions for being licensed . To counteract " snake oil salesman " who were preying on the public , state governments developed licensing requirements for the practice of the healing arts , bringing more credibility , power and respect to the field . Medicine was therefore able to attract those people who were compassionate and healers . The fields of allopathic medicine ( i.e. , " M.D. " medicine ) and chemistry blossomed . As our understanding of chemistry evolved , it began to change the face of our country . We went from almost no foreign chemicals in our environment to tens of thousands of new ones that our bodies had to learn to detoxify . These are added to our food , water supply , building materials , clothing , and not surprisingly to our medications . In addition , where a natural substance can not be patented , new chemicals can be . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , for indigestion , patentable acid blockers can cost over $2 a pill where nonpatentable calcium carbonate may cost a nickel ) . People realized that there was a lot of money to be made in medicine and in patentable medications . This money was used to influence legislation and people 's perceptions in an attempt to eliminate competition . Language was added to legislation to consolidate allopathic medicine 's power . As the FDA was appropriately developed to protect public safety in the face of thousands of new chemical medications , language was also added saying that a manufacturer could not claim that something was effective for treating an illness unless it went through the FDA approval process . As this process costs $400-$800 million per treatment , only things that are patentable ( i.e. , not natural ) can recoup these enormous costs . Vitamin Bsub 6 used for carpal tunnel syndrome is an excellent example . Treating carpal tunnel syndrome with 250 milligrams of Bsub 6 daily for six weeks costs about $9 per patient . Vitamin Bsub 6 manufacturers would therefore find it impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not advertise Bsub 6 for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome . Because of this , most patients instead spend between $2,000 and $4,000 to have surgery . This situation is the same for hundreds of other nonpatentable , effective , inexpensive and relatively safe treatments . The FDA has even been fighting to make it illegal for stores that sell supplements to hand out copies of well done scientific studies showing the effects of the supplements . In one legislative stroke it became illegal for the manufacturer of natural medicines/products to advertise or even give you information about how they can help you get well-regardless of how good the scientific data was supporting the claim . Legislation was also pushed through saying that anyone who was not an M.D. or osteopathic physician could not diagnose or treat you . In addition , it was illegal for companies making natural products to give the patient the research studies and information needed to make an informed decision . At the same time , we were ( mistakenly ) taught in medical school that nutritional and natural therapies had no scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that only " old-fashioned " doctors would use these treatments . Thus , despite large amounts of scientific data supporting natural medicine , you 'll find that your doctor will usually not have been told about this data , may be hostile to it and will sometimes even refuse to look at the studies . Modern medicine went from using the wonderful tool of science to becoming the " religion of Scientism . " Fortunately , as always , life moves forward seeking balance and growth . Although it had its strengths , people also began to recognize allopathic medicine 's weaknesses . Research continued on natural and energy ( e.g. , acupuncture ) therapies despite lack of funding and acceptance by mainstream journals , and many practitioners , seeing how effective they were , explored this expanding body of research . As medicine was hostile to and turned a blind eye to this research , those who were M.D.s ( like me ) were often introduced to this information by our patients . As a physician , I thererore came out of medical school with the impression that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught about it . If someone claimed he or she could effectively treat a nontreatable disease , that person was a quack . If such a treatment existed , I would surely have been told about it . I was wrong . When I first started my practice , patients would ask me if I knew about certain herbal or nutritional treatments for illnesses . For example , one patient asked me if I had ever heard about using coenzyme Q10 for congestive heart failure . " That 's nonsense , " I answered . " If coenzyme Q10 helped congestive heart failure , do n't you think I would have been taught to use that instead of doing heart transplants ? " I said that I would look into it , however . Joyce Miller , the Anne Arundel Medical Center librarian , has always been happy to obtain studies for me ( and she has found many thousands over the years ) . When she did a literature search on coenzyme Q10 , she found a number of studies showing it could be beneficial in treating congestive heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few months , this scene was played out again and again . I decided to keep notes on these rare " pearls " in a 3O-page spiral notebook . My notes are now over a thousand pages long . The area of natural medicine has been growing tremendously in the last few decades and is now able to help give you your life back . As an example , combining natural and prescription therapies has allowed us to research and develop highly effective treatments for people with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia . These syndromes are characterized by exhaustion , widespread pain , " brain fog , " and insomnia-crippling over 6 million Americans . Most doctors tell the patient that nothing can be done and they simply have to live with the illness . Natural practitioners , however , know that this is not the case . " Gold standard " placebo-controlled research demonstrates that over 91 percent of patients can now get marked improvement using an integrative medicine approach ( the full text of the studies can be seen at www.vitality101.com ) . In fact , natural medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses . Recognize that as most physicians were trained in university hospitals , over 95 percent of the clinical training that your M.D. received was in treating severe , life-threatening illnesses . I was taught more about how to tell whether fluid coming from the patient 's nose was from a skull fracture than I was taught about how to treat a common cold . It was somehow presumed that if we could save your life in acute life-threatening emergencies , we would also magically know how to treat common non-emergency problems . As most of you with pain , fatigue , hormonal or other day-to-day problems have learned , this is sadly not the case . The good news is that as more and more doctors familiarize themselves with the scientific literature , many are becoming more open minded to therapies that can help you . They are trying to do the best they can and progress is occurring . Comprehensive medicine , which combines the best of natural and prescription therapies , is well on its way to becoming the medicine of the future .
