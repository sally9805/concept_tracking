Stoner &; Spaz By Ron Koertge Candlewick Ron Koertge For a couple of days I do n't see Colleen . Which disappoints me . Which reminds me of why I am what I am : a bit player in the movie of life . Listed at the tag end of the credits : Crippled Kid . Before Thug #1 but after Handsome Man in Copy Shop . Then my phone rings and I lunge for it . It has to be her . Nobody calls me . I mean that . Nobody . My answering machine probably has cobwebs in it . Without saying hello or anything , she asks , " I was talking to some kids at school about you . What happened to your mom ? " I fall back on the bed , relieved and excited . " Nobody knows . She just split . " I roll onto my side . " Turn on AMC . Check out how John Ford shoots this scene so it looks like John Wayne is about a hundred feet tall . " As I watch , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her quick intake of breath . " I thought John Wayne actually was a hundred feet tall . " " The Searchers is still really popular . Do you know the story ? Ethan totally devotes his life to finding this niece of his that the Comanches kidnapped . I guess most people like the idea of somebody who 'll just look for them and look for them and never give up no matter how long it takes . " " My father disappeared , too . " " When ? " " Like about a second after I was born , I guess . Even John Wayne could n't find that son of a bitch . " " You do n't want to go look for him ever ? " " No way . Do you want to find yourmom ? " " Sometimes . Around the holidays , usually . When it 's just Grandma and me and a turkey as big as a VW . " " Do you know Ms. Johnson ? " " The sociology teacher ? " " And resident feminist . She says sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to be true to themselves . " " So it 's not always because some kid is dragging his foot around the house ? " That 's when Grandma knocks softly on my half-open door . I turn my back on her and whisper into the phone , " Looks like I better go . " Colleen whispers back , " Me , too , if I want to keep up with my regimen of self-destructive behavior . " Grandma leads me into the living room . This is never a good sign . " I hope I did n't disturb you , Benjamin . " " That 's okay . I was just talking to a , uh , friend . " " How nice ! " I can almost see the exclamation point , and it means she 's surprised I have a friend . I 'm not getting into that . " Did you want to talk to me ? " " Yes , I spoke to the new neighbor this morning . She seems very pleasant , and I thought it would be a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds out an envelope , one of her ritzy cream-colored ones . " It 's a bit on the short-notice side , but I 've got leukemia next week , then UNICEF , and before you know it the whole Tournament of Roses thing begins in earnest . Our phone number 's right at the bottom in case she is n't home , but I believe she is . " " You want me to take this over now ? " " It 's barely dark . I do n't think she 'd be alarmed . " Then she looks down at my sweats , the ones she sends to the cleaners . In old-fashioned cartoons there are always rich women looking at things through these glasses-on-a-stick . That is my grandma . She pretty much looks at everything like she has glasses-on-a-stick . Including me . Especially me . " Would you mind changing , dear , since you 're going to go out-of-doors ? " For somebody with C.P. , changing clothes is no piece of cake . The good side has to help the bad side , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not careful , I 'll get all my clothes off and see myself in the mirror . And that is something I try never to do . Fifteen minutes later , I 'm standing on the curb , still sweating from the struggle . God , I hate getting dressed . It always reminds me of how I am . A couple of SUVs glide by , both of them driven by the littlest mommies in the world , like there 's some place called Inverse Proportion Motors and the smaller you are , the bigger the car you have to buy . Lurching across the empty street , I wave at Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong , who sit on their porch every evening and stare at the Neighborhood Watch sign with its sinister cloaked figure . I make my way up the walk of 1003 between borders of purple lobelia . The lights are on . Music seeps out from under the oak door . Just in case the doorbell 's broken , I tap with the little bridle that hangs from the brass horse 's head . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighbor . From across the street . " The door opens . A woman in a striped caftan says , " Yes , can I help you ? " Her black hair is short and shot through with gray . She has quick-looking eyes and sharp features . If some people look smoothed by hand , this lady is machine made . I tell her my name and why I 've come . " Marcie Sorrels . " She 's holding a drink with her right hand , so she sticks out the other one . I show her my bad arm , the fingers curled into a pathetic little fist . " Not a stroke , I hope . " " C.P. " " But not dyskinetic . " " No , spastic . " " Ah , well , you were lucky . " " That 's the title of my autobiography : Ben , the Lucky Spaz . " She opens the door wider . " Why do n't you come inside and be hard on yourself ? " All of a sudden , I just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of there . What does she know ? I think . Who does she think she is , anyway ? And then I wonder if I 'm having a heart attack , because I 've never thrown anything at anybody in my life , not even a baseball . Well , for sure not a baseball . Where does all that emotion come from ? Is it just from hanging around Colleen , who 's so famous for going off on teachers she has a permanent seat in detention ?
