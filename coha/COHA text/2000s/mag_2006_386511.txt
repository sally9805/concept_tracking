The fight against overpopulation is not over , and global population is projected to reach between 9.5 billion and 12 billion if fertility rates do not continue to decline . That projected total could be lower if more investment is made in family-planning services , sex education , and women 's education and empowerment , according to experts . - World Trends &; forecasts , Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 23 * Companies will see the age range of their workers span four generations . Workers over the age of 55 are expected to grow from 14% of the labor force to 19% by 2012 . In less than five years , 77 million baby boomers in the United States will begin reaching age 65 , the traditional retirement age . As a result , the idea of " retirement " will change significantly . - John A. Challenger , " Working in the Future : How Today 's Trends Are Shaping Tomorrow 's Jobs , " Nov-Dec 2005 , p.48 * Education for the millennial generation will become more personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mobile , personalized , on-demand media environment that poses challenges to traditional classroom-bound educators . Millennials are comfortable with multitasking , which forces their teachers to fight for their time and attention . Millennials also work and learn more collaboratively than previous generations , so testing an individual learner 's progress may become increasingly difficult . - World Trends &; Forecasts , May-June 2006 , p. 7 ENVIRONMENT * The costs of global-warming-related disasters will reach $150 billion per year . The world 's total economic loss from weather-related catastrophes has risen 25% in the last decade . According to the insurance firm Swiss Re , the overall economic cost of catastrophes related to climate change threatens to double to $150 billion per year in a decade . The insurance industry 's share would be $30-$40 billion annually . However , the size of these estimates also reflects increased growth and higher real-estate prices in coastal communities . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Nov-Dec 2005 , p. 13 * Humanity will continue to produce more carbon than oceans or forests can naturally absorb . The current absorption capacity of carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , yet 7 billion tons are added annually . That figure could grow to 14 billion tons per year if current trends continue . - Jerome C. Glenn and Theodore J. Gordon , " Update on the State of the Future , " Jan-Feb 2006 , p. 21 * Coastal fisheries could disappear in Florida .

In contrast , more corporations will move their headquarters back to major metropolitan cities , to allow management heads to network with their global peers in banking and the media , while nonessential duties are performed elsewhere . - Joel Carreau , " The Santa Fe-ing of Civilization , " Jan-Feb 2006 , p. 43 * By 2025 , 75% of U.S. residents will live on the country 's coasts . The migration of more people to the nation 's coasts raises many concerns-such as the preservation of wetlands , increased housing costs , transportation bottlenecks , and higher insurance losses due to more and more expensive damage from tropical storms and hurricanes. - Edward Cornish , " Planning in an Age of Hyperchange " ( book review of FutureThink by Edie Weiner and Arnold Brown ) , Mar-Apr 2006 , p. 62 * Some localities may disappear in a post-petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of certain communities that rely on petroleum for transportation . Even hybrid vehicles may not come soon enough to save them . Arizona , for instance , is currently so automobile-dependent that , without cheap oil and power , its far-flung communities may fade away in 50 years . - Mark Blyth , " Will Wind and Biofuels Be Enough ? " July-Aug 2006 , p. 28 HEALTH AND MEDICINE * Uses of nanotechnology in medicine will increase . Smart drug-delivery systems that release medicines into the body at a precise location could arrive before the end of the decade . Bio-nanotubes developed at the University of California at Santa Barbara respond to electrical charges that occur inside the body in order to release drug payloads at specific locations . Researchers believe that the chemotherapy drug Taxol is one potential candidate for the smart bio-nanotube capsules . - Tomorrow in Brief , Nov-Dec 2005 , p. 2 * By 2030 , we will see drugs individualized according to a patient 's genome . These drugs will be both safe and effective , but the overall market will become fragmented due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with limited growth opportunities under these scenarios . If so , they may diversify into other industries , such as cosmetics , veterinary medicine , clinical laboratories , and industrial agricultural chemicals . - Jay Herson , " Innovation in Pharmaceuticals : Speeding Up Development of New Cures , " Jan-Feb 2006 , p. 29 * Embryonic stem cells will help the fight against Alzhelmer 's disease . Scientists in the United Kingdom have succeeded in growing brain and lung tissue from embryonic stem cells . The researchers believe that the new technique for growing brain tissue will eventually help doctors build replacement neural or brain matter for people who suffer from Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's diseases . A 2003 Swedish study estimates that Alzheimer 's disease afflicts 27.7 million people globally . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Mar-Apr 2006 , p. 17 * Children 's " nature deficit disorder " Is a growing health threat . Children today are spending less time in direct contact with nature than did previous generations . The impacts are showing up not only in their lack of physical fitness , but also in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that immersing children in outdoor settings-away from television and video games - fosters more creative mental activity and concentration . - World Trends &; Forecasts , May-June 2006 , p. 13 * Look for cell-based computing and microchip-enhanced brains . New research fusing electronic microchips with living brain cells could one day lead to chip implants to combat neurological disorders . Connecting neurons to semiconductors successfully is the key to future breakthroughs in human-computer synthesis . - World Trends &; Forecasts , July-Aug 2006 , p. 14 INFORMATION SOCIETY * Computers may soon have artificial empathy for their users . Computer scientists are developing ways for machines to sense their users ' mood . Bored ? Distracted ? Frustrated ? A more user-aware computer could one day pick up on your body language , facial expressions , and tone of your voice , then perhaps pull up a soothing photo of your puppy to calm you down if you 're upset . - Tomorrow in Brief , May-June 2006 , p. 2 * Education will be portable , and learning will be " on-demand . " Education may follow the entertainment-delivery model , allowing customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when they want it . Faculty will increasingly upload lectures and educational " playlists " to Podcasting services for students to attend at their convenience . - Tomorrow in Brief , Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 2 * Internet will Increase need for social connections . New mental illnesses such as " digital depression " and " connected aloneness " are on the rise as people spend more time engaging virtually with others through the Internet and cell phones rather than face-to-face . Future products and services that enhance personal experiences and life enrichment could help meet the challenge of restoring the personal-virtual balance . - Karl Albrecht , " Eight Supertrends Shaping the Future of Business , " Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 27 * Loss of minority languages could be reversed . Globalization is one of the forces driving out minority cultures and their languages , but communication technologies and national policies may help reverse the trend . Thanks to the Internet , Modern Hebrew , for instance , can be studied and spread around the world . Catalan , French Canadian , Irish Gaelic , and Welsh are among the minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and businesses . - Eric Garland , " Can Minority Languages Be Saved ? " JulyAug 2006 , p. 31 * Text will be Instantly translated Into multimedia presentations . No more waiting for the movie version : Rapid language processing will create multimedia animations of your favorite book ( or any text , such as directions to a museum in a foreign city ) . Filmmakers could use the technology to create morerealistic Storyboards from screenplays and experiment with different camera angles before actors are brought onto the set . - Tomorrow in Brief , July-Aug 2006 , p. 2 RESOURCES * Agriculture 's role in the world economy may expand . By concentrating more on producing transportation fuels than food , the world 's farmers could strengthen their role in the global economy . Sugarcane or palm oil grown for fuel , for instance , could give producers in tropical and subtropical countries a vital strategic advantage . One side effect : Supermarkets and service stations will increasingly become competitors for agricultural commodities . - Lester R. Brown , " Rescuing a Planet Under Stress , " July-Aug 2006 , p. 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly 200 million Africans are facing serious water shortages . That number will climb to 230 million by 2025 , according to the United Nations Environment Program . Finding fresh water in Africa is often a huge task , requiring people ( mostly women and children ) to trek miles to public wells . While the average human requires only about 4 liters of drinking water a day , as much as 5,000 liters of water is needed to produce a person 's daily food requirements . More wells and water displacement pumps could alleviate this problem . - Patrick Tucker , " Power by Play : A Child-Run Water Pump , " Nov-Dec 2005 , p. 68 * World energy demand will Increase dramatically . Experts predict that energy demand will rise by 60% between 2002 and 2030 and will require about $568 billion in new investments every year . Part of this demand can be offset through greater energy efficiency . The Texas Transportation Institute has found that in the United States alone 2.3 billion gallons of gas is wasted each year in traffic jams . - Jerome C. Glenn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Future , " Jan-Feb 2006 , p. 23 * Coal could make a cleaner comeback . Skyrocketing oil prices make cheaper energy sources like coal look more attractive . Use of coal worldwide is expected to grow by 1.5% a year . If not managed properly , that increased consumption could have dire environmental impacts . New cleaner-burning plants could convert the coal into a synthetic gas , which would be more efficient , use less water , and through carbon trapping technology make coal virtually emissions free . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 15 * Cost of solar energy will decline . Electricity generated from solar power is expensive and thus a minor player on the energy scene . But the cost of photovoltaic panels has declined by 90% in the past three decades , and the market is expected to grow from $11.2 billion in 2005 to $50 billion in 2015. - World Trends &; Forecasts , Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 16 SECURITY * In the future , the military will focus more on shaping perceptions than on human targets . Many U.S. security experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people around the world perceive the West and themselves . The most-dangerous military threat in the coming decades will arise from small , independent groups without the ability to directly challenge U.S. might . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Mar-Apr , 2006 , p. 6 * Computer viruses in ordinary objects may become a terrorist weapon . As more and more things ranging from luggage to pets have radio-frequency identification tags , new opportunities are emerging for tampering , security disruptions , or even terrorist attacks . A single piece of luggage infected with a computer virus could disrupt an airport 's baggage-handling database . - World Trends &; Forecasts , July-Aug 2006 , p. 14 TECHNOLOGY * We 'll incorporate wireless technology into our thought processing by 2030 . In the next 25 years , we 'll learn how to augment our 100 trillion very slow interneuronal connections with high-speed virtual connections via nanorobotics . This will allow us to greatly boost our pattern-recognition abilities , memories , and overall thinking capacity , as well as to directly interface with powerful forms of computer intelligence and with each other . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move beyond the basic architecture of the brain 's neural regions . - Ray Kurzweil , " The Future of Human-Machine Intelligence , " Mar-Apr 2006 , p. 43 * Within the next three decades , people will begin experimenting more freely and recklessly with nano-electronic personal enhancement . One type of nano-device people might try to incorporate into their biological functioning could be artificial blood cells ( respirocytes ) , which could greatly enhance human performance . Unfortunately , they could also cause overheating of the body and breakdowns. - Jerome C. Glenn and Theodore J. Gordon , " Update on the State of the Future , " Jan-Feb 2006 , p. 23 * We will soon be able to build computer models of our preferences , opinions , and mental associations . These new technologies will mark the convergence of cognitive science and more traditional methods of psychology . Further in the future , we can expect the development of rigorous means for recording and classifying all of a person 's 50,000 episodic memoriesthat is , memories of specific events and the feelings that accompanied them . - William Sims Bainbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle to Save Our Souls , " Mar-Apr 2006 , p. 25 * Computers will be more than 1,000 times more powerful In a decade , one million times more powerful In 20 years , and one billion times more powerful in 30 years . By then , some machines might have capabilities to rival the human mind , giving rise to a new intelligent species to share the planet with us. - Damien Broderick , " Nanofactories , Gang Wars , and Feelies , " MarApr 2006 , p. 47 * Human babies may be genetically manufactured by the end of the century . Nations have historically competed for technological supremacy , as seen in the twentieth century with the nuclear arms and space races . This competition will likely continue with biotechnology . If China , for instance , pursues a goal of creating a workforce with superior intelligence , then ethical qualms about engineering human beings may be brushed aside in other countries that do n't want to fall behind in the smart-baby race . However , geneticist Ian Wilmut believes that , due to the subtle nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to design " super " babies will most likely result in a new generation afflicted with completely avoidable birth defects . - Eric G. Swedin , " Designing Babies : A Eugenics Race with China ? " May-June 2006 , p. 21 ; Patrick Tucker , " Designer Babies and 21st Century Cures " ( review of After Dolly by Ian Wilmut ) , Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 48 * From prosthetic aids to mind programming ? Cochlear implants , which meliorate hearing loss , are a harbinger of future human-machine interfaces . Currently , such devices operate one-way , with sensors picking up data and delivering it to the user 's brain . But in the future , neural devices could be wirelessly connected to a computer , delivering information from your brain to a network . Our thoughts would thus become visible to all . - Michael Chorost , " The Mind-Programmable Era , " May-June 2006 , p. 68 TRANSPORTATION * A rise of disabled Americans will strain public transportation systems . By the year 2025 , the number of Americans aged 65 or older will expand from 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Census Bureau . Individuals in that age group are more than twice as likely to have a disability as those aged 16 to 65 . If that figure remains unchanged , the number of disabled people living in the United States will grow to 24 million over the course of the next 20 years . Rising rates of outpatient care and chronic illness point to an increased demand for public transportation as well as special public transportation services in the coming decades . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Nov-Dec 2005 , p . W * Wireless technologies will improve highway safety . Communications technology will enable motor vehicles to exchange information with each other , such as their proximity and speed . DaimlerChrysler is developing one such system , called CarTalk 2000 . The data exchange would occur through ad hoc networks that would spring to life as cars came near each other . - Tomorrow in Brief , Nov-Dec 2005 , p. 2 * Future cars may run on exhaust fumes . A device that uses vehicle exhaust to spin a turbine for generating electricity could allow future cars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power that a conventional engine produces is wasted in exhaust fumes . Turning those fumes into a power source could cut fuel consumption by as much as 10% , according to researchers . - World Trends &; Forecasts , May-June 2006 , p. 12 * Sports cars will be more environmentally friendly thanks to advances that will make hydrogen-powered fuel cells smaller and lighter . The sleek styling of sports cars could also make it cool for motorists to go green . - Tomorrow in Brief , May-June 2006 , p. 2 VALUES AND CULTURE * Workers will increasingly choose more time over more money . The productivity boom in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century created a massive consumer culture-people made more money , so they bought more stuff . In the twenty-first century , however , workers may increasingly choose to trade higher salaries for more time with their families . Nearly a third of U.S. workers recently polled said they would prefer more time off rather than more hours of paid employment . - Robert D. Atkinson , " Building a More-Humane Economy , " May-June 2006 , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience for art shrinks . New media such as video , virtual reality , and hyperlinked text will create new methods for artistic expression . But fine art is facing increased competition for viewers ' time and attention among " easier " forms of leisure , such as videogames and television , according to a RAND Corporation report , " A Portrait of the Visual Arts . " - World Trends &; Forecasts , Jan-Feb 2006 , p. 10 * The future of antiquities is bleak . Archaeologists may one day see a world where no culturally significant site has been left unpillaged , warns cultural reporter Roger Atwood in Stealing History . Tourists , tomb raiders , and treasure hunters are n't the only threats to a culture 's antiquities . Individuals living in poverty near valued monuments or other treasures increasingly treat these relics as a potential source of cash . Reducing illegal trade in antiquities will require better international cooperation among governments , museums , and private collectors . - World Trends &; Forecasts , May-June 2006 , p. 9 * Religious tolerance will increase-but not right away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their conflicting ideologies will continue to prevent peaceful coexistence in many societies . But as global communications and interaction among diverse peoples grows , tolerance is more likely to increase over the long term . - Thomas R. McFaul , " Religion in the Future Global Civilization , " Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 36 * Intolerance is accelerating along with growth of fundamentalist populations . The fastest-growing religions today tend to be those espousing the most-fundamentalist and exclusivist points of view , making the hope for peace tenuous . Separating religion from political decision making , as has largely been done in Europe , could help prevent institutionalized intolerance . - Roy Speckhardt , " Toward a More Inclusive Future , " Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 37 * Tolerance is accelerating along with Interaction of diverse populations . Global economics and communications are increasing business and social interaction across religions . This increased exposure will likely beget increased interreligious tolerance . - Harold G. Koenig , " Finding Tolerance by Respecting Diversity , " Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 37 WORK * The robotic workforce will change how your boss values you . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans can do , businesses will " hire " whatever type of mind that can do the work-robotic or human . Future human workers may collaborate with robotic minds on projects for a variety of enterprises , rather than work for a single employer . - Arnold Brown , " The Robotic Economy : Brave New World or a Return to Slavery ? " July-Aug 2006 , p. 53 * Advances In technology will give rise to a new era of " hyperJobs . " These new occupations will emphasize uniquely human skills over mere technical abilities . Hyper-human skills might include creativity , symbolic thinking , and responsibility . For example , the job of nursing may involve much less paperwork than it does today , and much more symptom detection ; surgeons could become extinct , replaced by surgical robots , but enjoy new occupations , such as surgical procedure developers . - Richard W. Samson , " HyperJobs : The New Higher-Level Work and How to Grow Into It " Nov-Dec 2005 , p. 41 * Outsourcing will actually create jobs . The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million jobs in 2002 to 165 million by 2012 , largely as a result of efficiencies gained through outsourcing. - John A. Challenger , " Working in the Future : How Today 's Trends Are Shaping Tomorrow 's Jobs , " Nov-Dec 2005 , p. 47 * Superlongevity will have a growing Influence on career choices . Realizing that their careers might extend for 50 years or more , younger careerists , even those not yet ready for full-time employment , will experiment with unique career patterns . More young people will opt to not only pursue postgraduate education , they may remain in school well into their 20s or early 30s in order to train for the complex jobs required in our advanced society . More people in their 50s will also return to school to start new careers . - Michael G. Zey , " The Superlongevity Revolution : How It Will Change Our Lives , " New-Dec 2005 , p. 16 Sidebar SPECIAL Focus ON CHINA AND INDIA * Economically , China and India will surpass Japan and the United States within the next 30 years . Both China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players on the world 's economic and political scene . India 's economy is predicted to surpass Japan 's by 2032 , and China could surpass the U.S. economy by 2039. - Marvin J. Cetron and Owen Davies , " The Dragon vs. the Tiger : China and India Reshape the Global Economy , " July-Aug 2006 , p. 40 * China will surpass the U.S. as world 's leading consumer . As a nation , China already outconsumes the United States on basic commodities such as food , energy , meat , grain , oil , coal , and steel . As individuals , Americans still lead the world in consumption , but if the Chinese economy continues its rapid growth , perperson consumption levels will match or surpass those of the U.S. , with dire impacts on the global environment . - Lester R. Brown , " Rescuing a Planet Under Stress , " July-Aug 2006 , p. 19 * More recognizable brand names will come from China . American firms have outsourced so much of their production to the Chinese that they have actually groomed their future competitors . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more uniquely Chinese brands to show up across all sectors of the consumer economy , including Changhong Electric ( an electronics supplier to Wal-Mart ) , Xi'an Aircraft ( a Boeing subcontractor ) , and Hair ( an appliance manufacturer ) . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Jan-Feb 2006 , p. 12 * Energy choices will make or break Chinese and Indian economies . Heavy reliance on fossil fuels , particularly coal , could undermine the investments that China and India have made in growing their economies . A new push toward developing the rich potential of solar and wind energy systems over the next 10 years could help these countries leapfrog ahead of the West , according to the Worldwatch Institute . - " Energy Challenges for China and India , " July-Aug 2006 , p. 41 * Dwindling supplies of water in China raise concerns for the global economy . With uneven development across China , the most water-intensive industries and densest population are in regions where water is scarcest . The result is higher prices for commodities and goods exported from China , so the costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 8 * China and India will be exceptions to the global urbanization trend . Nearly half of the world 's residents will live in cities by 2030 , according to demographer Philippe Bocquier . ( This forecast is substantially lower than the UN 's previous estimate . ) However , this urbanization trend is not occurring in the two countries with the largest populations-China and India . Nine out of 10 countries that will contribute more than half of all urban growth between 2025 and 2030 are developing countries : Indonesia , Pakistan , Brazil , Nigeria , Mexico , Ethiopia , Iran , Colombia , and Korea ( the tenth is Germany ) . According to UN estimates , the urban population of China is expected to increase by 293 million before the year 2025 , but Bocquier projects the number will be closer to 74 million . - World Trends &; Forecasts , Nov-Dec 2005 , p. 11 * The world economy will experience intense " Chinafication . " China 's growing consumer class and its monopoly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market for critical resources . Competitors among developed countries may increasingly cry foul over Chinese trade policies , currency manipulation , and piracy of intellectual property . - Karl Albrecht , " Eight Supertrends Shaping the Future of Business , " Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 26 * Outlook for Asia : China for the short term , India for the long term . By 2025 , both countries will be stronger , wealthier , freer , and more stable than they are today , but India 's unique assets-such as widespread use of English , a democratic government , and relative transparency of its institutions-make it more economically viable farther out . - Marvin J. Cetron and Owen Davies , " The Dragon vs. the Tiger : China and India Reshape the Global Economy , " July-Aug 2006 , p. 46 Sidebar " The tools of the futurist help to expose our assumptions and our blind spots .

More than half of U.S. doctors surveyed recently said a pandemic will arrive within the next four years . Public-health officials are particularly concerned about H5N1 bird flu , which is spreading globally and may evolve into a deadly human strain . Death toll projections range from 5 million to 150 million , depending on how well national and local governments prepare . - Tyler A. Kokjohn and Kimbal E. Cooper , " In the Shadow of Pandemic , " Sep-Oct 2006 , p. 53 * Bird flu pandemic could be devastating to agricultural economies . The 2003 outbreak of bird flu in Vietnam caused a 15% drop in poultry production , or about $50 million . If similar declines occur in Indonesia , the costs to poultry farming could be as high as $500 million . - Tyler A. Kokjohn and Kimbal E.
