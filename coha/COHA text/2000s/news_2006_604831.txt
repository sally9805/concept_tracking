<p> LOS ANGELES  --  If Southern California beats Texas tonight in the Rose Bowl and wins its unprecedented third consecutive national championship , there will be plenty of armchair historians in the game 's aftermath . <p> The Trojans will be crowned one of the best teams ever . Their place among college football 's dynasties will be secure . And every talking head and scribe in America will make like Doris Kearns Goodwin or David McCullough and put the accomplishment into some wide-sweeping context . <p> Let everyone else turn tonight 's game into a chase for more than a crystal trophy . Let everyone else dissect USC 's place in history . The Trojans are taking the lead from their be-in-the-moment coach , Pete Carroll . Ever since USC won last season 's title , talk of a Three-Pete has been impossible to escape . This past week it was deafening . <p> " I think everyone else wants to make a big deal about ( the run for a third consecutive title ) , which they should because it 's never been done before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , " quarterback Matt Leinart says . " Why are we going to talk about it if we have n't done anything ? Maybe we can talk about it after the game  --  if we win . Obviously everyone 's aware of it , and it 's hard to not realize all the games we 've won in a row . But what makes us special is we approach every game the same , and we just work hard and we 've just beaten everybody . We do n't get caught up in all the other stuff . " <p> All the other stuff would be the unrelenting spotlight and the outsized expectations . ESPN recently aired a series that ranked the 2005 USC team among the greatest of the last half-century . Which raises the question : Does n't USC first have to beat Texas tonight ? <p> Perhaps the rush to judgment is understandable , given USC 's array of stars and stats  --  two Heisman Trophy winners in the backfield , the 580.3 yards of offense a game and six first-team All-Americans . <p> No other school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trojans have won 45 of their last 46 games . If not for a loss to California in triple overtime Sept.27 , 2003 , USC could have tied the most famed streak of all  --  Oklahoma 's 47-game winning streak , set by Bud Wilkinson 's fabled teams in the mid-1950s  --  with a Rose Bowl victory . <p> Only five other teams in history have had winning streaks longer than 34 games . To match Oklahoma 's mark , the Trojans would have to beat Texas and roll through a third consecutive undefeated season . If so , they could be going for No.48 in next year 's national championship game . <p> As premature as all of that sounds , Carroll was asked about that scenario last week . If all the Three-Pete talk was so consuming this year , imagine what next year would be like if the streak continues . <p> " I 'm not worried about that at all , " Carroll deadpanned . " You 'd be surprised about how far down that is on my priority list right now . " <p> But do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was asked . " I think it 's a big deal when you 've won 46 , " he said . <p> Scares helped <p> In other words , there 's no need to get ahead of ourselves . After all , the Trojans do n't . They say that have n't forgotten what it was like to lose for a few seconds against Notre Dame . With the Trojans trailing 31-28 , a fumble by Leinart went out of bounds , the clock hit 0:00 and Fighting Irish fans started streaming onto the field . However , the scoreboard operator had n't stopped the clock , so seven seconds were added , and Leinart scored on the game 's final play . <p> " We kind of got the sense of losing , " senior linebacker Collin Ashton says . " Time was out , we had lost the game , everyone got that feeling in their stomach , and then we won it , so we kind of lucked out on that deal . We got a gift . " <p> There were other scares as well : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first half , trailed Arizona State 21-3 at halftime and had to rally in the fourth quarter to beat Fresno State . <p> So to the Trojans , the next game , no matter if it 's Hawaii or Notre Dame , is always the biggest on the schedule . What other teams see as distractions  --  USC 's practices are open to reporters and fans  --  are n't anything of the sort to the Trojans . This past week , the sidelines at USC 's practices were full of toddlers who would occasionally amble onto the field , gray-haired alums , Hollywood types such as Nick Lachey and dozens of reporters . <p> The program Carroll runs is insular and open simultaneously . Which is why he is n't worried about his players being overwhelmed by the magnitude of tonight 's game or all the talk about the team 's place in history . " That 's never in our conversation , " he says . " We do n't talk about national championships . That 's something that happens when it 's all done . " <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trojans , besides their talent , is this : They actually live it . Carroll 's philosophy has become theirs . <p> " We ca n't worry about the possible history that 's going to play into this game , " USC tailback Reggie Bush says . " We 've got to take it as another football game . ... We 've got to focus on this game , not get caught up in the hype . We 've got to focus on this team and this team alone . " <p> T-shirt 's streak <p> Sometimes a hint on how a team might handle the biggest of moments can be found in the smallest of details . <p> All week , USC players have dutifully answered all the weighty questions about winning streaks and their place in history . But they seemed more interested in talking about the small stuff  --  boxer shorts , ratty T-shirts and high school glory days . <p> Winning streak ? What winning streak ? Leinart would rather talk about his lucky boxers streak , rather than the Trojans ' 34-game run . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game against California , and the Trojans lost . " I 've had them every other game , " he says . <p> Ashton 's streak is even more impressive  --  135 consecutive Trojans home games . Ashton , a fifth-generation Trojan who attended his first USC game when he was a month old , has never missed a game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in his life . Then there 's the 12-year run of Ashton 's USC T-shirt , which he has worn under his jersey for every football game he has played in since he was 10 years old . " It 's got holes all over it , " he says . " If I hold it up , I can see you through it . " <p> USC 's underclassmen do n't even know what it feels like to lose a college game . Sophomore wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett has n't lost a game since his junior year in high school with the New Brunswick ( N.J. ) Zebras  --  which means his personal winning streak stands at 46 . Jarrett will detail the specifics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general terms when asked to put USC 's run in perspective . <p> Of course , most 19-year-olds have a limited perspective on history , so it 's easy to stay in the present  --  especially when it 's the place your coaches insists upon staying . But it 's also just as easy for a 19-year-old to listen to the hype so much that his helmet no longer fits . <p> Even though the Trojans have been compared to past dynasties , to them the Bear is that pesky opponent in blue and gold up north , not the one in the houndstooth hat . The Sooners are simply the team they crushed in last year 's title game , not the program that won 47 in a row . Tom Osborne is a congressman , not a coach who won a few titles at Nebraska . Notre Dame was just a great game won by Leinart , not a great program run by Leahy . <p> And Miami ( Fla. )  --  did n't it just get waxed by LSU ? ( The Hurricanes had a 34-game winning streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national title game against Ohio State  --  just a reminder that dynasties sometimes have a three-year shelf life . So enjoy the moment , Trojans fans . ) <p> Says Carroll : " The big comparisons with history , I ca n't help you . I really do n't know . I think that 's just for fun . I do n't know how they do that . <p> " The day and age we 're playing , I can imagine the speed and the technology we play with now and the style of things would give us an edge over the teams in the past . That 's not to say we 're better football players than those guys , but we 've evolved . Any of those wishbone teams that were great , I would n't want to touch any of them . I 'd call for a bye , so please do n't resurrect the wishbone . " <p> To Carroll , dwelling on the past or the future is a fruitless exercise . It does n't help him with the moment at hand . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end-of-the-rainbow kind of thing here , and we do n't do that , " he says . " If I started doing that now , I 'd start getting off the mark , and I could only expect that my players would do the same . <p> " We 're pretty disciplined about all of that . Really what 's it going to do for me ? What am I going to get out of that ? It does n't seem like it serves us well to be dwelling on anything beyond what 's going on today . <p> " However , there will be a time . I do n't know when . " <p> Second-half rallies <p> Given how dominant the Trojans have been this season , it 's easy to forget that they trailed four times at the half . It 's also easy to forget that every week they got every team 's best shot . <p> " You saw that with Fresno State , who after us completely went downhill , and that 's a really good football team , " Leinart says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us their best shot and giving everything they can to beat USC , and then they do n't have enough to beat ( Louisiana ) Tech and Nevada , teams that they should beat by 20 , 30 points . That 's why what we 've done is so special . " <p> After the Trojans , who were trailing in the fourth quarter against Fresno State , won 50-42 , Texas coach Mack Brown called Carroll to congratulate him and asked him about managing such a streak . <p> " I 've learned something from Pete out here , " Brown said Tuesday before the Longhorns entered tonight 's game with their own 19-game run . " Pete says if you keep talking about the streak and you keep thinking about the streak , they 're more likely to end . " <p> Streak ? What streak ? Dynasty ? What dynasty ? If the Trojans win tonight , that 's talk for tomorrow .
