ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT FOX , Mondays , 8 P.M. E.T . Critics have spent two years trying to bolster this show , without success . So here 's a change in strategy : do not check out TV 's best sitcom when it returns this month . Yes , this screwball comedy about an idle-rich family has simplified its story lines so new viewers can catch up . But who cares ? Crackling interplay between a top-notch ensemble , the fastest blizzard of jokes this side of The Simpsons and sly guest appearances by stars from Scott Baio to Charlize Theron  --  they 're all overrated . Besides , intense belly laughs can cause abdominal cramps . That 's why we critics secretly watch The King of Queens instead . We trust you 'll follow our lead , as always . <P> THE WEST WING NBC , Sundays , 8 P.M. E.T . A move to Sunday nights has sent the Washington drama 's poll , er , ratings numbers tumbling  --  ironically , just as it 's become complex and exciting . In its high-rated days , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race between Matt Santos ( Jimmy Smits ) and Arnold Vinick ( Alan Alda ) has given it what it always lacked : a nuanced conflict between two flawed but empathetic opponents . ( The Bartlet White House story lines seem like a distraction now . ) Santos and Vinick square off for a live debate on Nov. 6  --  just in time for you to rejoin this political party . <P> THE OFFICE NBC , Tuesdays , 9:30 P.M. E.T . When this verit-style comedy made its debut last spring , it got little love from fans pining for the British original . In its second season , The Office proves it 's no one 's poor American cousin ; it captures the absurdities of white-collar life right down to the uncomfortable office parties at Chili 's . Steve Carell ( The 40 Year-Old Virgin ) is dependably fatuous as a gasbag middle manager . But it 's the relative unknowns , particularly Jenna Fischer and John Krasinski as co-workers with an unconsummated crush , that give The Office its charm . Never has a lousy job been so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.T . The Sorelli sisters , unlike characters on many new shows , do not fight aliens . And unlike the quartet of Desperate Housewives , they do n't have affairs with pistol-packing plumbers . But what this winsome wallflower of a comedy-drama lacks in pyrotechnics , it makes up for with tart , zippy dialogue that explores their work , love and family dilemmas without cracking open the mush barrel . <P> STARTING OVER SYNDICATED , Check Local Listings This undersung daytime show takes elements of reality TV and talk shows and improves on both . Here , six women with problems from financial dependence to emotional aloofness spend weeks under one roof in the care of counselors . The show 's pop-psych devices can be bizarre  --  one woman and her " life coach " role-play a dialogue with her absentee dad using sock puppets  --  but the results are genuinely moving . It 's refreshing to see a reality show about a group of women  --  some in their 40s  --  who are n't babes looking to bag a man .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
