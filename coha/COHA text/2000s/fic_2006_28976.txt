Chapter One Sarah Anderson left her office at nine-thirty on a Tuesday morning in June for her ten o'clock appointment with Stanley Perlman . She hurried out of the building at One Market Plaza , stepped off the curb , and hailed a cab . It occurred to her , as it always did , that one of these days when she met with him , it would really be for the last time . He always said it was . She had begun to expect him to live forever , despite his protests , and in spite of the realities of time . Her law firm had handled his affairs for more than half a century . She had been his estate and tax attorney for the past three years . At thirty-eight , Sarah had been a partner of the firm for the past two years , and had inherited Stanley as a client when his previous attorney died . Stanley had outlived them all . He was ninety-eight years old . It was hard to believe sometimes . His mind was as sharp as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well aware of every nuance and change in the current tax laws . He was a challenging and entertaining client . Stanley Perlman had been a genius in business all his life . The only thing that had changed over the years was that his body had betrayed him , but never once his mind . He was bedridden now , and had been for nearly seven years . Five nurses attended to him , three regularly ineight-hour shifts , two as relief . He was comfortable , most of the time , and had n't left his house in years . Sarah had always liked and admired him , although others thought he was irascible and cantankerous . She thought he was a remarkable man . She gave the cabdriver Stanley 's Scott Street address . They made their way through the downtown traffic in San Francisco 's financial district , and headed west uptown , toward Pacific Heights , where he had lived in the same house for seventy-six years . The sun was shining brightly as they climbed Nob Hill up California Street , and she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog often sat heavily on the residential part of the city , even when it was warm and sunny downtown . Tourists were happily hanging off the cable car , smiling as they looked around . Sarah was bringing Stanley some papers to sign , nothing extraordinary . He was always making minor additions and adjustments to his will . He had been prepared to die for all the years she had known him , and long before . But in spite of that , whenever he seemed to take a turn for the worse , or suffered from a brief illness , he always rallied and hung on , much to his chagrin . He had told her only that morning , when she called to confirm her appointment with him , that he had been feeling poorly for the last few weeks , and it would n't be long . " Stop threatening me , Stanley , " she had said , putting the last of the papers for him in her briefcase . " You 're going to outlive us all . " She was sad for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he rarely felt sorry for himself . He still barked orders at his nurses , read The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal daily , as well as the local papers , loved pastrami sandwiches and hamburgers , and spoke with fascinating accuracy and historical detail about his years growing up on the Lower East Side of New York . He had come to San Francisco at sixteen , in 1924 . He had been remarkably clever at finding jobs , making deals , working for the right people , seizing opportunities , and saving money . He had bought property , always in unusual circumstances , sometimes preying on others ' misfortunes , he readily admitted , and making trades , and using whatever credit was available to him . He had managed to make money while others were losing it during the Depression . He was the epitome of a self-made man . He liked to say that he had bought the house he lived in for " pennies " in 1930 . And considerably later , he had been among the first to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money had been made in real estate development , trading one building for another , sometimes buying land no one else wanted , and biding his time to either sell it later or build office buildings or shopping centers on it . He had had the same intuitive knack later on , for investing in oil wells . The fortune he had amassed was literally staggering by now . Stanley had been a genius in business , but had done little else in his life . He had no children , had never married , had no contact with anyone but attorneys and nurses . There was no one who cared about Stanley Perlman , except his young attorney , Sarah Anderson , and no one who would miss him when he died , except the nurses he employed . The nineteen heirs listed in the will that Sarah was once again updating for him ( this time to include a series of oil wells he had just purchased in Orange County , after selling off several others , once again at the right time ) were great-nieces and - nephews he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins who were nearly as old as he was , and whom he said he had n't seen since the late forties but felt some vague attachment to . In truth , he was attached to no one , and made no bones about it . He had had one mission throughout his lifetime , and one only , and that had been making money . He had achieved his goal . He said he had been in love with two women in his younger days , but had never offered to marry either and had lost contact with both of them when they gave up on him and married other men , more than sixty years ago . The only thing he said he regretted was not having children . He thought of Sarah as the grandchild he had never had , but might have , if he had taken the time to get married . She was the kind of granddaughter he would have liked to have . She was smart , funny , interesting , quick , beautiful , and good at what she did . Sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit and look at her and talk to her for hours . He even held her hand , something he never did with his nurses . They got on his nerves and annoyed him , patronized him , and fussed over him in ways he hated . Sarah never did . She sat there looking young and beautiful , while speaking to him of the things that interested him . She always knew her stuff about new tax laws . He loved the fact that she came up with new ideas about how to save him money . He had been wary of her at first , because of her youth , and then progressively came to trust her , in the course of her visits to his small musty room in the attic of the house on Scott Street . She came up the back stairs , carrying her briefcase , entered his room discreetly , sat on a chair next to his bed , and they talked until she could see he was exhausted . Each time she came to see him , she feared it would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new idea , some new plan that had occurred to him , something he wanted to buy , sell , acquire , or dispose of . And whatever he touched always increased his fortune . Even at ninety-eight , Stanley Perlman had a Midas touch when it came to money . And best of all , despite the vast difference in their ages , over the years she 'd worked with him , Sarah and Stanley had become friends . Sarah glanced out the window of the cab as they passed Grace Cathedral , at the top of Nob Hill , and sat back against the seat , thinking about him . She wondered if he really was sick , and if it might be the last time . He had had pneumonia twice the previous spring and each time , miraculously , survived it . Maybe now he would n't . His nurses were diligent in their care of him , but sooner or later , at his age , something was going to get him . It was inevitable , although Sarah dreaded it . She knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long dark hair was pulled neatly back , her eyes were big and almost cornflower blue . He had commented on them the first time he saw her , and asked if she wore colored contact lenses . She had laughed at the question and assured him she did n't . Her usually creamy skin was tan this time , after several weekends in Lake Tahoe . She liked to hike and swim , and ride a mountain bike . Weekends away were always a relief after the long hours she spent in her office . Her partnership in the law firm had been well earned . She had graduated from Stanford law school , magna cum laude , and was a native San Franciscan . She had lived here all her life , except for the four years she spent as an undergraduate at Harvard . Her credentials and hard work had impressed Stanley and her partners . Stanley had grilled her extensively when they met , and had commented that she looked more like a model . She was tall , thin , athletic looking , and had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neat navy blue suit , which was the kind of thing she always wore when she visited him . The only jewelry she wore was a pair of small diamond earrings that had been a Christmas gift from Stanley . He had ordered them by phone for her himself from Neiman Marcus . He was not usually generous , he preferred to give his nurses money on holidays , but he had a soft spot for Sarah , just as she had for him . She had given him several cashmere throws to keep him warm . His house always seemed cold and damp . He scolded the nurses soundly whenever they put the heat on . Stanley preferred to use a blanket than be what he thought of as careless with his money . Sarah had always been intrigued by the fact that he had never occupied the main part of the house , only the old servants ' rooms in the attic . He said he had bought the place as an investment , had always meant to sell it , and never had . He had kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . It was a large , beautiful , once-luxurious home that had been built in the twenties . Stanley had told her that the family that had built it had fallen on hard times after the Crash of ' 29 , and he had bought it in 1930 . He had moved into one of the old maids ' rooms then , with an old brass bed , a chest of drawers the original owners had abandoned there , and a chair whose springs had died so long ago that sitting on it was like resting on concrete . The brass bed had been replaced by a hospital bed a decade before . There was an old photograph of the fire after the earthquake on the wall , and not a single photograph of a person anywhere in his room . There had been no people in his life , only investments , and attorneys . There was nothing personal anywhere in the house . The furniture had all been sold separately at auction by the original owners , also for nearly nothing . And Stanley had never bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her that the house had been stripped bare before he got it . The rooms were large and once elegant , there were curtains hanging in shreds at some of the windows . Others were boarded up , so the curious could n't look in . And although she 'd never seen it , Sarah had been told there was a ballroom . She had never walked around the house , but came in straight from the service door , up the back stairs , to his attic bedroom . Her only purpose in coming here was to see Stanley . She had no reason to tour the house , except that she knew that one day , more than likely , after he was gone , she would have to sell it . All of his heirs were in Florida , New York , or the Midwest , and none of them would have an interest in owning an enormous white elephant of a house in California . No matter how beautiful it had once been , none of them would have any use for it , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived in it for seventy-six years and neither furnished it nor moved from the attic . But that was Stanley . Eccentric perhaps , unassuming , unpretentious , and a devoted and respected client . Sarah Anderson was his only friend . The rest of the world had forgotten he existed . And whatever friends he had once had , he had long since outlived them . The cab stopped at the address on Scott Street that Sarah had given the driver . She paid the fare , picked up her briefcase , got out of the cab , and rang the back doorbell . As she had expected , it was noticeably colder and foggy out here , and she shivered in her light jacket . She was wearing a thin white sweater under the dark blue suit , and looked businesslike , as she always did , when the nurse opened the door and smiled when she saw her . It took them forever to come downstairs from the attic . There were four floors and a basement , Sarah knew , and the elderly nurses who tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to Sarah was relatively new , but she had seen Sarah before . " Mr. Perlman is expecting you , " she said politely , as she stood aside to let Sarah in , and closed the door behind her . They only used the service door , as it was more convenient to the back staircase which led up to the attic . The front door had n't been touched for years , and was kept locked and bolted . The lights in the main part of the house were never turned on . The only lights that had shone in the house for years were those in the attic . They cooked in a small kitchen on the same floor that had once served as a pantry . The main kitchen , a piece of history now , was in the basement . It had old-fashioned iceboxes and a meat locker . In the old days the iceman had come , and brought in huge chunks of ice . The stove was a relic from the twenties , and Stanley had n't worked it since at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be run by a flock of cooks and servants , overseen by a housekeeper and butler . It had nothing to do with Stanley 's way of life . For years , he had come home with sandwiches and take-out food from diners and simple restaurants . He never cooked for himself , and went out every morning for breakfast in previous years before he as bedridden . The house was a place where he slept in the spartan brass bed , showered and shaved in the morning , and then went downtown to the office he had , to make more money . He rarely came home before ten o'clock at night . Sometimes as late as midnight . He had no reason to rush home . ( Continues ... )
