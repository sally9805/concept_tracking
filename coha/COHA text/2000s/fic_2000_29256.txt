In which Sir John reveals to me his failures * * * At the age of sixteen , in the year of 1771 , I , Jeremy Proctor , could at last say that my education in the law had properly begun . Having read twice through Sir Edward Coke 's Institutes of the Law of England and made copious notes , I had been judged by Sir John Fielding to be ready to begin the study and discussion of it with him . This , Sir John confided , was more or less the same process he himself had followed when he had read law with his brother , Henry . He was of the opinion that what it lacked in formality , it more than made up for in providing the scholar with a proper grasp of the principles of law . " It is essential , " said he to me on more than one occasion , " that in learning to be a lawyer you must first learn to think like a lawyer . " Nor was Sir John my only teacher at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ) . In an even more informal way I learned something , as well , from young Mr. Archibald Talley . He , though two years my senior , was only a bit further on in his reading of the law , and so we were no doubt well matched in the discussions which took place between us nearly every week . It was commonest for us to share a pew at Old Bailey and then adjourn to a coffee house nearby that we might examine together the trial or trials we had that day witnessed . In this way , each learned from the other , though what we learned was as often false as true usually the product of mere speculation . Of course Sir John knew ofthese visits to the law courts and of their aftermath spent in discussion , and in general he approved of them . He thought it well that I should have a companion in study , though from time to time as we studied Coke , he would chide some of my more bizarre interpretations , saying , " Is that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague ? " Invariably this was said with a chuckle , so that I could take no offense at it . ( Indeed I could take no offense at anything said to me by Sir John . ) It was inevitable that the two should meet if only , for no other reason , because young Mr. Talley had asked so often that they might . He admitted that his eagerness stemmed from a chance remark made by his uncle , Judge Benjamin Talley , to the effect that he thought Sir John the most skilled interrogator of any member of the London bar . The nephew , Archibald , had then told me that he had asked his uncle why , if this were so , Sir John was but a magistrate . His uncle had replied to that , " Because , you see , he has offended too many of the rich and powerful . " Then did he add , shaking a finger at Archibald : " And let that be a lesson to you , young sir ! " But having knocked so often , Archibald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first sought Sir John 's permission to bring my fellow scholar to a session at Number 4 Bow Street . Then , having secured it , I invited young Talley round a week later . Together we sat through an early afternoon of pickpocketing , public drunkenness , and putative breach of contract . Thus it was , one might say , a typical sort of day in the magistrate 's court of Sir John Fielding . Young Talley was visibly unimpressed : he yawned ; he dozed ; he came fully awake only when Mr. Marsden , the clerk , called before Sir John one Nancy Hawken , who was charged with prostitution and who pled not guilty . And though it was she who stood accused , it was her accuser , a Mr. Pyle , who was made to answer most of the magistrate 's questions . It became evident through Sir John 's questioning that the situation between the two was this : Pyle had been her client or had , in any case , accepted Mistress Hawken 's invitation to her room in Bedford Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of prostitution . " His contention was that because she had accepted his money it was but three shillings she was a prostitute . Her contention was that even though she had first taken his money " as any sane woman would do " nothing more had taken place , " due to the fact as he was incapable , owing to his drunken state , Sir John . " Therefore , said she , no " act of prostitution " had taken place . If that were the case , declared Mr. Pyle to the magistrate , then she should pay him back his three shillings . Not so , said she . " A customer pays for my time and my consent , and he got both . " There was a loud roar of laughter at that from the crowd that filled the little courtroom . Young Mr. Talley joined in with all the rest . I , having mastered my natural tendency to guffaw with the crowd , waited as , predictably , Sir John beat hard upon the table at which he sat and demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the magistrate when all was quiet again , " it was when you refused to return Mr. Pyle 's three shillings that he accused you of prostitution ? " " That 's as it seemed to me , Sir John . " " Then let me ask you , Mr. Pyle , would you have run forth and fetched a constable if you had been given back the amount you had freely given Mistress Hawken ? " " That ai n't the point , " declared the accuser . " What she done was against the law , and I 'm for the law , I am . " " Admirable , " said the magistrate , " and let me assure you , sir , I , too , am for the law . Yet it seems to me that the validity of your accusation turns upon the definition of what you call the act of prostitution . ' According to you , it took place when she accepted your three shillings . According to her , it would have taken place only if some manner of sexual congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , it did not , she maintains that she owes you nothing , since you were given ample opportunity to do what you had paid for . And so , Mr. Pyle , I am inclined to find in her favor . Mistress Hawken 's understanding of what constitutes prostitution is much closer to what is generally accepted . And so your accusation is denied by me . Further , the three shillings in question are hers to keep . " At that , Mr. Pyle set to grumbling loudly , complaining at the unfairness of the decision until the magistrate silenced him with a single stroke of his gavel . Then did Sir John call out to the accused : " Mistress Hawken ! " " I am here , sir . " " And a good thing , too , " said he , " since I have not yet dismissed you . I wish to congratulate you on your defense . I must remind you , however , that as Mr. Pyle has said , prostitution is against the law . You are perhaps luckier than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as engaging in prostitution but by your own admission you would have done if circumstances had been otherwise . In short , Mistress Hawken , if you come before me again , you may not be so fortunate . My advice to you is to find some other line of work for yourself . " She stood silent before him until , sure at last that he had finished , she raised her voice timidly in response . " I 'll certain'y give that some thought , sir , " said she to him . " See that you do . You are now dismissed . And you , Mr. Pyle , if you are still about , you , too , may go . " Then , assured by Mr. Marsden that they had completed their work for the day , Sir John ended the session with another loud clap of his gavel . He rose quickly from his seat , and in a trice , he had disappeared through the door behind him which led indirectly to his chambers . " Would you now like to meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , indeed I would , " said he . But then , as we moved against the crowd toward the door , he made a rather curious comment : " Had it not been for that last case he tried , " said Talley , " I should probably have begged off the introduction . To tell the truth , I was quite bored by all those that preceded it . And , I must say , I was a bit disappointed in your man , Sir John . All I could do to keep awake , I fear . " I 'd suspected as much , of course , for I 'd seen him yawn and doze . But to speak of his " disappointment " in Sir John ? Even if he had indeed experienced such , it was hardly the sort of thing one would discuss , was it ? " I thought , " said I in a manner rather cool , " that you had been quite eager to meet him . " " Oh , I was , and I am , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last matter , the one to do with the whore . He quite took her accuser apart , did he not ? " " As you say , " said I , stepping ahead to lead the way through the door to the court 's " backstage " area the strongroom , the armory , Mr. Marsden 's alcove with its files and boxes of court records , et cetera . To all of this my young colleague gave close attention . I ushered him swiftly to the room at the end of the hall . The door stood open to us . I knocked upon it , identifying myself and my companion , and Sir John bade us enter . " Sir , " said I , " may I present Archibald Talley ? " " You may , Jeremy , and pleased I am to meet your young friend . " Sir John rose and offered his hand , which was taken and shaken politely by young Talley . We were then invited to seat ourselves , and the two of them began to talk . Theirs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The visitor praised to excess the magistrate 's handling of the Nancy Hawken case . Sir John , for his part , made little of the matter , insisting that all credit was due to her . " I daresay , " said he , " that formula she stated how did it go ? she offers her time and consent and nothing more that should prove worth remembering , do n't you think ? " He mused silently for a moment , then added : " I think it interesting how many matters , even criminal cases , turn on questions of contract just as this one did . " Being blind , Sir John could not then see the look of near bafflement that appeared on Talley 's face . Yet correctly interpreting the lack of response from him as signifying lack of understanding , he tactfully changed the subject of their discussion . " Benjamin Talley is your uncle , is he not ? " asked Sir John . " You have begun reading law with him , have you ? " " I have , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancery judge . I have heard naught against him . And there are few perhaps none of whom that can be said . " " He also has a high opinion of you , sir . " " That is always good to hear , " said Sir John in a manner somewhat complacent . ( He was a man who knew his own worth . ) " But tell me , what is your object in reading the law that is to say , what plan have you for your future ? Your uncle might be of assistance in procuring a judgeship for you , but that can be only much in the future . You will need courtroom experience as a barrister , I assume ? " " Oh , I suppose so , yes . " This was said with a singular lack of enthusiasm . " But neither , really , fits into my plans as a course I wish to follow . " " Well , what , then ? " I , too , wanted to know , reader , for I had ever assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto my own , and to me the law had always meant the courtroom the drama of it , the combat . I was naturally curious regarding his plans and wondered why I myself had not before heard of them . " I 've my eye set on Parliament , " said Talley in a manner most confident . " Ah , you have , have you ? " Was there something challenging in Sir John 's tone ? Yes , indeed there was . " In general , my father is behind me in this , yet he insists I have some means of supporting myself in the event that I 'm not successful . Oh , I quite agree that what he insists upon is the prudent course but reading law is , you must admit , rather a dreary business . " " Oh , it has its rewards for those of a certain turn of mind , " said Sir John . " But do tell me how you plan to make your beginning in politics . Will you simply announce your interest to the world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly difficult , for Papa has promised to buy me a good , safe Tory seat just as soon as one becomes available following my majority . But after that , says he , I shall be on my own . It will be my responsibility to hold on to it ever after . " " And if you fail in that , you have always the law to fall back upon . A judgeship , perhaps ? In a pinch , I suppose you might even accept an appointment as magistrate . " " Oh , I doubt that should be necessary , " said Talley with a smile . " Once I 've made my entry into politics , I intend to remain . " " Well , then , " said Sir John , rising of a sudden from his chair , " I applaud your sense of purpose but offer a word of caution . Be not too certain of the future , for fate has a way of offering us willy-nilly that which we least expect . So was it in my life , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nod , he added , " Pleasant as this has been , young Mr. Talley , I fear I must put an end to our chat . I have letters to dictate , and Jeremy is , as you may know , my chief scribe . In my blindness I depend upon him greatly . " " Ah , yes , of course , " said Archibald Talley , fairly jumping to his feet . " You must forgive me for overstaying my leave somewhat . I was quite fascinated by our conversation . And I do thank you for allowing me to attend your magistrate 's court . I found it " he hesitated " most entertaining . " " Hmm , well , thank you , I suppose . Jeremy , will you see your young friend out ? " As I did so , I found myself brooding upon that word " friend " with which Sir John had described Talley and his relation to me . My young friend ? Was he truly ? I was sore embarrassed by what he had said in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not only denigrated Sir John 's position as magistrate , he had also spoken dismissively of the law as a profession . I certainly believed and had heard from others that Sir John deserved better than what he had gotten yet he was no ordinary magistrate : He had made the heart of London safe , and , with the help of the constables who made up the Bow Street Runners , had kept it so ; he had been knighted ; his powers of investigation and interrogation were such that even Judge Benjamin Talley was made aware of them . And , well , as for belittling the law , that seemed to me pure folly , and I must tell Mr. Talley so sometime . In fact , I determined that I must discuss a good many things with him . But I knew that this was not the time . I felt it best to get him out the door as quickly as ever I could . It was easily done . Though he blattered on as I led him to the door which led to Bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anything he said , so content was he to listen to the sound of his own voice . As it happened , when we parted at the door , he wished me a simple " good day " and made his way quickly out into the street . I then hastened back to Sir John . Tapping on the door I had left open , I called out to him that I had returned and asked if he wished now to dictate the letters . I confess that I was somewhat taken aback at the vehemence of his reply . " Jeremy , I give neither a farthing nor a fart whether we write the letters now or later . What I want from you , lad and want most immediate is a promise from you that you will not ever again bring that ... that puffed-up , self-satisfied child of privilege into my presence again . " " Why , sir , you have it , " said I. " In truth , I believe I was as pained by him as you were annoyed . " " Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid you to see the fellow . That is your affair though why or how you should expect to learn anything in the company of such a blockhead I can not suppose . " " Blockhead , sir ? " " Indeed ! He had no understanding of my remark regarding contracts . Surely you , Jeremy , saw what I was getting at . " " Yes , Sir John . The two of them Mr. Pyle and Mistress Hawken had entered into a contract of sorts , yet each had differing notions of the terms of the contract . " " Bravo ! Put right to the point . I daresay that fellow Talley has given no thought to contracts whatever . Perhaps his uncle has not yet mentioned them to him . " At which point he loosed an abrupt laugh before continuing : " Then was I unwise enough to ask about his ambitions and plans in the law and what did I learn ? That the law is not sufficiently entertaining to hold his interest . It 's politics . Ah , would n't it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may buy for him a seat in Parliament ? I did n't know they were for sale . " " Oh , they are , right enough , and his father can pay any price . He is Lord Lammermoor . Your fellow Archibald had the bad luck to be born a second son . He will inherit nothing . His elder brother takes it all . And so Papa feels it incumbent upon him to set Archibald up in business , and the business his son has chosen is politics , which can indeed be quite lucrative . However , it is of them all one of the most insecure , and so Lord Lammermoor has insisted that his second son be educated in a profession so that he may have something to fall back upon . " " So Archibald Talley is the second son of a great lord , " said I , musing . " Yes , and that means he will be granted favor and helped along his whole life through . It is a great advantage to be even the second son of a nobleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your career to come . " ( Ah , reader , how I liked the sound of that ! ) " But let us put such matters aside , " he resumed . " Now , as I recall , I began to rant in this unholy manner when you asked politely if I wished to dictate some letters . Let us indeed do that . There is one that demands special attention . " " And what is it , sir ? " " I received an invitation from the Lord Chief Justice to serve on a commission of some sort . Since I am in his debt in the matter of Constable Cowley , I think it prudent to accept . " " Then , " said I , pulling a chair up to his desk that I might sit opposite him , " let us pen it at once , and I shall deliver it this very afternoon to the manse in Bloomsbury Square . " Thus the letter was written and , as I promised , brought that day to the residence of William Murray , Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bench . Neither Sir John nor I could reckon then what an important part that missive would play in our lives , nor that it would greatly , even fatally , affect the lives of others . It was perhaps a week later that I came to learn a bit more of this commission of which Sir John had spoken so lightly . As it happened , it was a day that started badly for me . No sooner had I returned from a morning buying trip to Covent Garden than Mr. Marsden called to me that Sir John wished to see me as soon as I had done with the groceries I had bought us . And so I hauled the packages up the stairs and put them away in those places which our young cook , Annie , had designated as proper for storage . What I had done for her upon occasion I now did as a matter of routine all this since her schooling had begun . Yet withal , I begrudged her naught . Then at last to Sir John , who awaited me in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , so that he failed at first to perceive my polite tapping upon his open door . There was indeed nothing wrong with his hearing , but there were times when he did concentrate so upon his thoughts that he became quite oblivious of all else . And so I knocked loud upon the door , knuckle against wood , and called his name . " Ah , Jeremy , " said he , " come in , lad , come in . I 've an idea oh , call it an exercise that may interest you . " " Oh ? And what is that , sir ? " " To make it quite clear , I shall need you to locate a particular file of cases for me . " " And where might it be ? " " Well , in truth , lad , I 've no idea at all . I simply tell Mr. Marsden to put the files away , and he does it . If you ask him where he has it stored , I 'm sure he can tell you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for ? What title has been put to it ? " He put two fingers to his chin and rubbed it reflectively as he considered the matter I had put before him . At last he declared , " Now , that is a good question . We ca n't very well find it if we know not what title he has put to it , can we ? " Frowning , he lapsed once more into silence . Then said he , " I have it ! Just tell him we are looking for the red file . That should be all he needs to know . There was a very good reason for calling it the red file , which I shall reveal to you when you have found it . " " Very good , sir . I 'll be back with it as quick as ever I can . " So saying , I left in quest of Mr. Marsden , curious what might be in this mysterious file , and eager to know to what use Sir John would put it . I found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked , but standing on the doorstep to Number 4 Bow Street , puffing away at his morning pipe . When I told him my purpose in seeking him out , he began to shake his head slowly , a look of deep concentration upon his face . " The red file , is it ? " said he . " Yes , " said I , " do you remember it , sir ? " " Oh , I recalls it right well . It 's just I ca n't bring to mind when it was I put it away . Y'see , the when of it would tell me the where of it . " I nodded my understanding as he knocked ash and a wad of spent tobacco into the palm of his hand and allowed it to drop down onto the walkway . " Let 's go along inside , " said he . " P'rhaps I can advise you what boxes to look in . " " Well , if you would not mind , sir , I 'm sure it would be a great help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his alcove a scrivener 's table surrounded on three sides by sturdy boxes filled with files where he stood looking at each one thoughtfully . He designated three that I might try , each marked with dates many years before . I had bare begun on the first of them , when a thought occurred to me . " Mr. Marsden , " said I , " is the file truly red , or has it simply a mark upon it ? " " Oh , well , I 'm not quite sure . But it seems to me , now that I think back upon it , that I had an artist 's brush for makin ' signs and some red ink , and I just painted a great red stripe across the top of the file . Sir John asked me to mark it in some such way . " " Did he say why he wished it so ? " " Oh , he did , but his reason now escapes me . " " And the title of the file ? " " That also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great stripe of red along the top . That indeed should have made it easy to locate , and might have were it not for the disorder of the individual files . Papers notes and foolscap pages seemed to have burst higgledy-piggledy from each one , obscuring those behind it . It would take a great effort and much time to put them all in order . Mr. Marsden 's court session notes were accurate and complete , yet he was rather careless of how he disposed of them when done . Now , I thought , if I were Sir John 's clerk ... ( I often had such exaggerated notions of how I could set the world to right . ) The red file was not to be found in the first three boxes designated by Mr. Marsden , nor in the next three , nor in any of them piled round in his alcove . When I had been through them all , he shook his head sympathetically and suggested that since it was near noon , and the day 's session of his magistrate 's court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search to the file boxes kept in Sir John 's chambers ; in that way , I would cause no bother and make no disturbance . That is what I did , yet with no greater success than I had earlier had . These files seemed to be in better order , yet in contrast the boxes were dustier and more numerous . As a result , it took at least as long to examine these as the rest in the clerk 's alcove . Indeed , it must have taken well over an hour , for just as I opened the last box , Sir John entered the room and halted just inside the door . " Jeremy ? " he said . " Is that you ? " " It is , Sir John , and I 've still not found the red file . " " Hmmm ... well ... it must be somewhere about . " As he took his customary position in the chair behind his desk , I continued my search . I saw no red stripe . There was no such file . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent upon a fool 's errand ? I could not believe that Sir John would intentionally put me on the track of an object he knew could not be found . Yet perhaps it had long ago disappeared without his knowledge . It might have been borrowed by the Lord Chief Justice . Not knowing its contents , I could not say who else might have taken it away , but of course there might be a great many . " There , " said I to Sir John , " I 've been through every box in Mr. Marsden 's alcove , and every file here in this room , and I can tell you in all truth , Sir John , the red file simply is nowhere to be found . " " Hmm ... looked both places , have you ? All those files ? " " Yes , sir , and the last I examined in this box was dated 1764 . " " Well , if they go back so far in time as all that , you may as well look in the cellar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was sinking . " Ah , indeed , " said he . " The records of the Bow Street Court back to its beginnings are kept below . If it 's not here , then it must be there . It stands to reason , do n't you think ? " " As you say , Sir John . " ( With a sigh , reader , with a sigh . ) " Ask Mr. Marsden to take you down there . He 'll acquaint you with the order in which the records have been stored . Surely you 'll find it there . " With that , I turned smartly and started from the room . " And Jeremy ? " " Yes , Sir John ? " " Do be sure to bring with you a sufficiency of candles . There are many files stored there , and Mr. Marsden tells me that it is as dark as pitch in the cellar , even in the daytime . " I sighed . " Yes , sir . " It was , as described , dark as pitch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle in hand , he seemed to move through the surrounding blackness with some slight difficulty , as if it were a substance so heavy , so thick , as to be almost palpable . And so it was as I followed him : The darkness pressed in upon me . " Mind your step here at the bottom , " said he . " There 's a bit of a bump down where the brick floor leaves off and the dirt bottom begins . " I did as he admonished , feeling my way carefully with my toe , discovering a drop that I reckoned at no more than an inch or so . Still , it would have been sufficient to send me sprawling had I come upon it unwarned and lost my balance . " Give me two of that handful of candles you 've got , and I 'll stick ' em up here in the holders on the wall and light them , " said he . We managed the exchange without difficulty , and he did as he said he would do . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cellar seem more commonplace and far less threatening . There were , it is true , boxes piled upon boxes all along the wall , indeed more than I had examined thus far up above . It looked to be a daunting piece of work . " These go back to the beginning of the Bow Street Court , do they not ? " I asked . " Back to the time when Henry Fielding was magistrate . " " That 'd be right , Jeremy . " " Were you his clerk , as well ? " " Not I , " said he . " I followed a fellow named Brogden . He 'd been clerk as long as anyone could remember back to Henry Fielding 's time , anyways . " He stood silent for a moment , hesitating . Then he added : " Well , I 'll leave you , Jeremy . I must write my accounts of today 's session . As you can see , the boxes are marked by year usually about two boxes per calendar year . The farther you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " " I understand . " He then left me with a nod and a good-luck wish and , ascending the stairs , he deprived me of a fraction of the light by which I had viewed the cellar . Should I light another candle ? Probably unnecessary . Even as a child I had had no fear of the dark . Yet this place , dank and a bit mysterious , was not merely dark ; it seemed somehow threatening , more like a dungeon than a cellar . From deep within it came the sound of water dripping , and from somewhere nearer I heard the scurrying of little feet . Rats , they were , and I quite disliked the filthy little creatures then as much as I do now . I wondered if they had ever kept prisoners down here . Perhaps a discreet inquiry to Mr. Marsden ... Ah , well , I had put matters off quite long enough . I must resume my search for that ever-elusive red file . I dragged down the first box , which was marked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found the red file in the next box , one that bore the date 1763 . " What title did Mr. Marsden put upon the file ? " Sir John asked of me . In responding , I held up the file , which as I had been told was marked with a wide stripe across the top , then read to him the legend printed in bold black letters upon the red . " It says , Unresolved , ' sir . I confess I looked inside and found three separate cases , one from 1756 , another from 1759 , and the last from 1763 , the year under which it was filed . " " Yes , I had Mr. Marsden gather the three together in a single file . He generously called these cases unresolved , ' whereas I referred to them as my failures . ' " " Failures , ' Sir John ? " " Aye , Jeremy , failures . And that was why I encouraged our worthy clerk to decorate the file in some manner with red , which is universally recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad , these were the cases that left me red-faced and full of shame . " This was altogether a surprise to me . I knew not what to make of this confession of failure or more , failure in triplicate . Among the magistrate 's many virtues , neither I nor others would have rated humility high . Though never arrogant or excessively proud , he nevertheless felt himself the equal of any man , aristocrat or noble , and superior to most . Yet as I gazed at him across the desk there in the simple room he called his chambers , it seemed to me that for him now to call attention to his mistakes , his " failures , " was but final proof of his great confidence in himself . Only a man who believes profoundly in his own worth will undertake to criticize himself . " I thought , Jeremy , you might benefit from my mistakes . " " Oh ? In what way , sir ? " " I should think it reasonably evident , if not obvious , " said he in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read through them one by one , I believe you might put your finger , so to speak , upon the place or perhaps places where I went wrong in my investigation . In each case , I believe , my failure can be attributed to mistakes in interrogation though in the earliest instance bad medical advice certainly played a part . " " But , " said I , " would I be able to grasp the background , the circumstances , of these cases from these notes ? " I glanced through them and saw , as I suspected , that there were oddments of every sort mixed together scraps of paper , letters , interrogation records , and in two instances full accounts of coroners ' inquests . What was I to make of such a hodgepodge ? " Well ... I had thought so , " said he , " though perhaps not . Perhaps I should give you something on the order of a sketch of each one ... the details ... the context . " And that , reader , he then proceeded to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manner was the earliest . In 1756 ( only a year after my birth ) a chemist of Tavistock Street fell ill . His wife summoned a physician , who diagnosed his difficulty as acute indigestion and prescribed a common powder to ease his upset . Yet the problem continued into the next day and the next . He did then rally somewhat and throw off the symptoms of this lingering discomfort . On the fourth day he was back behind the counter of his shop , serving his customers ; whereas earlier he had been forced to remain behind a curtain , whispering instructions to his wife . That night he fell ill again in the same way ; the doctor was summoned again and was present when the chemist expired . Sir John then simply John Fielding suspected poisoning , but the attending physician assured him this was quite unlikely : Though there were many poisons in the chemist 's stock , the wife ( now widow ) was a simple country girl , recently married , who could not even read labels on the bottles , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Cox , then coroner , held an inquest into the death of the chemist , and his jury found " death by natural causes . " The widow sold the shop and returned to her home , a village in Hampshire . For a time , and a brief time it was , she lived with her mother ; but then she remarried , taking as her new spouse one near her age with whom she had grown up . There were rumors in the village . " And so , " said I to Sir John , " you suspected her still . " " I did indeed . " " Why , then ? " " Because she was young , pretty , and half the age of her husband , the chemist . As I later discovered , though it was true she had no letters and no knowledge of chemistry , it was also true that her mother was a midwife and an herb healer with a great store of knowledge regarding natural medicines and natural poisons . " " How did you learn this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire . I at last took it upon myself to write a letter to him inquiring what had become of her , something we would not hesitate to do today . Yet then I had simply delayed too long to make a proper case against her . I attribute my ill-handling to my inexperience . And inexperience was to blame for my next failure , as well . " The next tale told by Sir John concerned the death of a young maidservant from one of London 's great houses . Notification had come to him from another of the servants that she had been buried in a most irregular manner at night , it was , and outside the gates of any churchyard or cemetery . The master of the house , a duke , had had an eye for the girl , and the duchess had been called out of London to her parents on the night in question . So it was that about midnight or sometime thereafter the servants were wakened by a great bellow from the master . He had , he said , just discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . She was dead , her neck broken , fully clothed but disheveled . It was obvious , said he , that she had lost her balance and tumbled head over heels down the stairs and broken her neck as she went . What was she doing upstairs , after all ? Up to no good , you can be sure , declared her employer and proceeded to " find " a gold ring belonging to the duchess in the apron pocket of the corpse . He ordered that she be prepared for burial that very night , for a thief who had died in the course of her crime did not deserve Christian burial . It was done as he had told them : She was buried in a winding sheet in the garden at the rear of the mansion . When Sir John heard of this sad event , it was two days after it had taken place . Nevertheless he insisted , over the strong objections of the duke , that the body be disinterred . There could be no disputing the cause of death : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull . Still and all , the circumstances were sufficiently questionable that the magistrate interrogated the duke closely and repeatedly . The duke 's friends visited Sir John and suggested that he was not showing proper respect for the fellow . Pressure was brought to bear . In the end , when the coroner 's jury returned a verdict of " death by misadventure , " Sir John pushed the matter no further . He did , however , insist that the maidservant be given a proper Christian burial and that the duke pay the cost . " And you believe , " said I when Sir John had finished relating the facts of the case , " that this nobleman ... this duke ... had pushed the woman down the stairs ? " " Nothing as specific as that , " said Sir John . " I believed , let us say , that the master of the house was in some way responsible for her death . Whether in forcing his will upon her he snapped her neck , or , in pursuing her , he made her run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or just what the precise circumstances were , well , I can not say . Yet I was certain then , just as I am now , that directly or indirectly he was responsible . " " And the gold ring in her apron pocket ? " " Oh , that ! " Sir John said with a deprecating shrug . " There was not sufficient reason to believe that she herself had put it in her pocket . All the servants gave her a good character , and even the duchess was puzzled and said that the maidservant had many opportunities to steal far more valuable pieces . " " But I take it there was no way to prove your case . No physical evidence ? No testimony against him ? " He sighed . " No , nothing at all . I might have broken him down had I kept at him long enough . On the other hand , I might not have . In any case , after the coroner 's inquest there seemed little to do but accept death by misadventure ' as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy , that if you will read through the notes on the interrogation taken by the former clerk , Mr. Brogden , you will find one , and perhaps two places in which I was provided with an opening which I failed to use . In other words , I made a mistake perhaps two . " I nodded soberly at that . " Yes , sir , " said I , " if it is there , I shall find it . " " I 'm confident that you will . " He paused then , as if organizing matters in his head or summoning up some important detail . It was only after a few moments spent thus that he did resume . " The last of these failures of mine offers no such specific mistake or oversight at least I , in repeated reconsiderations , have been able to find none . However , there remains with me a certain unease about the resolution of the case . But let me tell you of it " Two men from the North American colonies registered at the Globe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strand . Though they arrived together and clearly knew each other , they asked for separate rooms and neither voiced any objection or disappointment when the hostelry was unable to provide them on the same floor . They sometimes took their dinners together at the hostelry 's chophouse and seemed to get on well enough except for their last meal together there . At that one they quarreled , the larger and rougher of the two raising his voice often in anger , and the younger and more refined of them hissing his responses in vexed whispers . Sometime during the night that followed , the second of them evidently committed suicide , for he was found next morning by the maid , hanged by the neck . Except for the quarrel , there was naught to cast suspicion upon the surviving colonial and he even denied that a quarrel had taken place . Though there was no note left , the suicide seemed genuine ; there were no marks upon the body , nothing to indicate that he had been knocked unconscious before being hanged . Perhaps more important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the hanged man 's room , gave testimony that he had polished boots and shoes all night and would surely have noticed if there had been a visitor to the room in question ; he swore there had been none . There was thus nothing to be proven against the survivor , though Sir John was extremely suspicious of the man . The colonial gentleman claimed to know the other fellow hardly at all , having met him only on shipboard . His story held up through Sir John 's repeated interrogations and , as well , against the milder questioning of the coroner , Sir Thomas Cox . The coroner 's jury returned a verdict of " death by suicide " shortly afterward . " You are free , Jeremy , to find my mistakes in this case , and I shall accept them with head bowed low . In my opinion , however , mine are sins of omission here . Should I have been more aggressive with my questions ? What question did I not ask that I should have asked ? That sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to the effect that I thought it extremely unlikely that I should find any sort of fault with him , when of a sudden he rose swiftly from his chair and announced his fear that as we talked it had grown late . " Have you some idea of the time , lad ? " I gave it a moment 's thought . " I should think it about three by the clock , or perhaps a little earlier . " " If you 're correct , " said he , " then we 've no time to spare . In any case , you must go quickly and do a wash-up and then change into your best . We ought not be late . " " But where are we going , sir ? " " Why , to the Lord Chief Justice 's residence . Did I not tell you ? " Hesitating , I said , " No , sir , I think not . " " You 'll recall taking a letter in which I accepted a position on the Laningham commission ? Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of said commission today at four . " By this time I was near out the door . " I 'll not be long , sir . " " Very good , Jeremy , but take with you the red file . I think it will prove a diversion from Sir Edward Coke a bit of real life , something of the here and now . " " As you say , Sir John . "
