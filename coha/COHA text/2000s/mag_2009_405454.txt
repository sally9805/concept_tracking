21st Century First Lady A spot-on insight into Michelle Obama , with one exception : you forgot to mention our First Lady 's sorely needed attention to the families of our armed services June 1 . Our returning soldiers , especially the wounded , need to know we care about them , and she is reminding us of that . David Jensen , STAMFORD , CONN . To see Michelle Obama , the **25;780;TOOLONG of slaves , up close is to finally see America up close . Until her arrival , most Americans did not know the White House and Capitol were built by slaves . For those who contributed so much to our nation , the time has arrived for their progeny , the Michelles and Baracks , to receive their just due . Helen H. Gentry , DETROIT Your article about Michelle Obama was delightful . There is no doubt that she is truly special in many ways . However , I ca n't escape my negative feelings regarding the angry person first presented to us many months ago . How on earth can the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a church under the auspices of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright ? It still pains me that she could bring her children into such a negative , anti-American environment . Bette Hirsh Levy TARZANA , CALIF . In your cover story , you name Michelle Obama " one of the most professionally accomplished First Ladies ever . " Yet by failing to detail her vocational accomplishments ( lawyer , associate dean at the University of Chicago , senior executive at the University of Chicago Medical Center ) , you neglect to define her as something other than " Mom in Chief . " That is a sacrifice of identity indeed . Courtney Sender , MONTVALE , N.J. I 'm a card-carrying Democrat who voted for Barack Obama and would do it again . But you have got to stop treating the First Family as if they were Brad and Angelina and children . Michelle Obama is a beautiful , poised and educated woman , not a Hollywood-celebrity wannabe . Jeanni Green , DAYTON , OHIO Michelle Obama . Two words : National treasure . Coventry Kessler , GREENSBORO , N.C. Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Gallup poll regarding abortion rights was intriguing June 1 . But what has always confused me is the fact that most Republicans are more than willing to legislate and regulate the most intimate and private part of a woman 's life . Yet they call for smaller , less intrusive government and are indignant over any limits on the Second Amendment right to bear arms . Where is Republicans ' governmental restraint when it comes to women ? Abby Loberg , GRANBY , COLO . Gibbs ' suggestion that " most people are neither pro-choice nor pro-life but both " is ill informed . Since January 1973 , Americans have clearly understood this issue and been sharply divided on it . But just in case Gibbs is n't clear : pro-life means , Do n't take the life of an unborn child . Pro-choice means , The wants or needs of the pregnant woman supersede the idea that human life is valuable . And the Gallup poll suggests more people are valuing human life . There 's no confusion here . This is n't above my pay grade . Therese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Joe Klein , for being the rare writer to condemn both the use of torture and the release of its images June 1 . The response to the use of torture should be based on a factual examination , not on a visceral reaction to pictures . Images are not necessary to understand and evaluate what has happened . One can comprehend and assess a story about a murder , for example -- and have a complete moral response -- without seeing the crime-scene photos . Nadia El-Badry DOBBS FERRY , N.Y .
