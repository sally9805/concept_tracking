There is no pill that does for women what Viagra does for men  --  yet . Some doctors have experimented with the male hormone testosterone to enhance a woman 's libido , but without the benefit of rigorous trials . Now a new study , conducted by Dr. Glenn Braunstein at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in L.A. , has taken some of the uncertainty out of testosterone therapy . Nearly 450 women who had lost their ovaries were given either a testosterone patch or a placebo . After six months of treatment , the women on 300 mcg of testosterone a day reported an 81% increase in satisfying sexual activity and a 66% increase in sexual desire . Some women in both the testosterone and the placebo groups experienced side effects , such as headaches , acne and increased facial hair .  --  By Sora Song
