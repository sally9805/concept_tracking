<p> For American investors , one of the thorniest questions is how many foreign stocks to own . All investors are unilateralists at heart , biased toward the homeland , and most economists think that 's a mistake . <p> I plead guilty to this crime myself . I own only one foreign-stock fund , T. Rowe Price International Stock ( PRITX ) , and it represents less than 2 percent of my total financial assets . ( By the way , this is not a recommendation ; it 's a decent fund with low fees , and I have owned it for a long time , but there may be better . ) I do own foreign stocks in other ways  --  through a few closed-end funds that concentrate on individual developing markets and through mega-U.S. funds that also own foreign shares . For instance , among the top 20 holdings of Fidelity Contrafund ( FCNTX ) , which I consider the best of the large-cap funds , are EnCana Corp . ( ECA ) , a Canadian oil and gas company ; Ryanair Holdings PLC ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electronics , the Korean high-tech giant ; and Rio Tinto PLC ( RTP ) , a London-based mining company . <p> Why own pieces of companies based in other countries ? <p> One reason is that " investing globally conveys a mighty benefit simply in terms of added opportunity , " as a recent report by Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. , a New York investment firm , put it . Today , U.S. stocks represent only about half the total value of global markets , down from two-thirds in 1970 . T. Rowe Price 's research department recently pointed out that none of the 10 largest companies that make steel , electronics or appliances is based in the United States . Listed on the 21 major markets outside the country are 1,005 substantial public corporations . Why ignore them ? <p> But a more important reason to invest in foreign stocks is that , historically , markets have tended to move independently ; when one is up , the other may be down , and vice versa . In technical terms , such markets are said to lack correlation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , you get a smoother ride with roughly the same returns . <p> A study by Bernstein found that between 1970 and 1995 , U.S. stocks significantly outperformed non-U.S . stocks in 12 calendar-year periods while non-U.S . outperformed U.S. in 12 years as well ; in only two years were returns about the same . <p> But that study , you 'll notice , ended in the mid-1990s . Immediately afterward , something seemed to change . Markets , especially in the developed world ( North America , Europe and Japan ) , became more and more correlated . In 2000 , for example , the average U.S. large-cap growth fund fell 16.3 percent while the average international fund fell 15.6 percent . <p> A study by Robin Brooks and Luis Catao for the International Monetary Fund looked at the performance of 5,500 stocks in 40 markets over the period 1986-2000 . The researchers found that the correlation between returns in American and European stock prices rose from 0.4 in the mid-1990s to 0.8 in 2000 . In other words , the movements of U.S. stocks could explain 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 40 percent a few years earlier . <p> If shares of large U.S. and foreign companies move roughly in tandem , then , obviously , you wo n't benefit from a lack of correlation . Instead , you may as well own the best companies in the world , wherever they may be , without any special urgency to hold foreign stocks in your portfolio . <p> It 's unclear , however , whether the late 1990s were an aberration or the vanguard of a brave new correlated world . Over the past 12 months ( ended Wednesday ) , for instance , the Dow Jones World Index ( which does not include U.S. stocks ) returned 28 percent while the Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index , the U.S. benchmark , returned only 16 percent . In 2002 and 2003 , foreign stocks rose a total of 17 percent while U.S. stocks were practically flat ( up 0.2 percent ) . On the other hand , so far in 2004 ( again through Wednesday ) , the MSCI World Index has risen 1.7 percent while the S &P; has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn Jr. , a talented money manager who has concentrated on foreign markets for about a quarter-century , believes that the post-1995 period was a fluke . Horn is president and portfolio manager of Polaris Capital Management , a Boston firm that handles $262 million for institutions and wealthy individuals and runs a public mutual fund called Polaris Global Value ( PGVFX ) , on which Morningstar Mutual Funds bestows its top rating , five stars . <p> " You have to look at correlations over long periods of time . Fifty or 60 years , " Horn told me last week . " We have good data since 1970 . " That history was summarized recently in an excellent Bernstein study released in April titled " Fortune &; Misfortune . " Between 1970 and 2003 , if you owned a portfolio composed of 30 percent foreign stocks and 70 percent U.S. stocks , you would have received roughly the same returns as with an all-U.S. portfolio  --  but , for the mixed portfolio , the volatility , or risk , was lower . <p> In other words , your returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down  --  which means that you were more apt to enjoy the ride . It would n't disturb your sleep , and you would n't be inclined to bail out at the wrong time . <p> Horn said that the apparent correlation between foreign and U.S. stocks in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the result of the run-up in a single sector : telecommunications , media and technology . High-tech stocks all over the world rose so much that they distorted the broader country indexes , which are weighted by the market caps of the companies they comprise . " Nortel became one-third of the Canadian market , " said Horn . " Nokia became one-half of the Finnish market . So , the rise in the sector made the indexes look more correlated . Is that a reason to throw international investing out the door ? No . " <p> Horn concedes that " the world is more integrated than in the past , " but , even though multinational firms do business worldwide , there remain considerable differences in the pace of growth in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take advantage of booming Asia . Over the next few decades , Asian competition may hold down U.S. wages , so why not profit from the growth of Asian capitalism in your retirement and make up for any relative loss in your pay ? <p> He points , for example , to ASM Pacific Technology Ltd. , the world 's largest supplier of assembly and packaging equipment for the semiconductor industry . The company is based in Hong Kong and listed on its exchange . A majority of the shares are owned by ASM International NV , which is listed as ASMI on the Nasdaq Stock Market and headquartered in Holland . <p> This company is not the sort you 're going to stumble on yourself  --  which is why international investing is usually done best through mutual funds . " ASMPT gained market share during the down cycle against its competitors , " said Horn . Shares of the parent are up by about one-third over the past 12 months , and the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio , based on expected 2004 earnings , of just 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just 0.7 , according to Yahoo Financial . Any PEG ratio under 1.0 typically indicates a bargain . <p> Horn is a bottom-up investor who buys and holds ( he keeps his average stock about three years , compared with just one year for the typical fund manager ) . He looks for companies first , countries second . For example , his fourth-largest holding at last report ( April 30 ) is a Finnish elevator manufacturer called KONE . " This is a good R &D; and production-innovation story , " said Horn . " They have reinvented the elevator , " putting a motor on the side , which takes up less space than conventional cables . <p> He also owns CRH PLC ( trading in the United States as American depositary receipts under the symbol CRHCY ) , a Dublin-based construction-materials company that sells aggregates and asphalt all over the world . Most U.S. companies in this business are small , but CRH last year grossed $13 billion . " You have to go to Ireland to invest in American infrastructure , " said Horn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P/E ratio , according to Yahoo 's calculations , is just 10 and its PEG ratio is 0.9 . It 's typical of the values to be found outside the United States right now . " What we see is that American companies are priced to perfection , priced very high , " Horn said . <p> Horn uses the ratio of a company 's price to its " cash earnings "  --  that is , official net earnings with depreciation and amortization and special reserves added back in  --  as a key valuation indicator . Right now , U.S. companies carry an average P/CE ratio of 12.9 while companies outside the United States have a ratio of 8.8 . " That 's a big difference , " he said . <p> Yes , and capitalizing on the difference has produced impressive returns for Polaris Global Value , which was up 47 percent last year and has returned 6 percent so far in 2004 . And talk about lack of correlation ! Between 2000 and 2002 , Polaris broke even while the U.S. benchmark was losing a total of one-third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means that he holds U.S. stocks as well as non-U.S . ( in financial jargon , an " international " fund owns only non-U.S . stocks ) . Right now , his exposure to U.S. companies is on the low side  --  44 percent of total assets  --  because he thinks stocks abroad are cheaper . He follows companies in 40 nations , and the fund is well diversified . About one-eighth of his assets are in British firms , but after that no country 's stock represents more than 6 percent of assets . <p> Horn holds 70 stocks in all , and each represents about 1.5 percent of his total fund . Among them : Continental Corp. , the German tire company ; Tokyo Electric Power Co. ; and Imerys , the French minerals company . He 's especially high on firms that are immune to competition from China , such as British home builders Persimmon PLC and George Wimpey PLC . <p> While I am persuaded by Horn 's argument that correlation is a passing fad , I still worry about the future of European and Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globally , they are still burdened with their governments ' economic policies , which have not proven very successful in recent years . <p> Between 1992 and 2003 , for example , the gross domestic product of the United States grew by an average of 3.2 percent annually after inflation ; Europe grew just 1.7 percent ; Japan , 0.9 percent . The United States grew less than 2 percent in only a single year ( 2001 , when we were attacked by terrorists ) while Europe grew less than 2 percent in six of the 12 years and Japan in nine of the 12 . <p> On the other hand , one would expect that this sluggish growth is reflected in lower foreign share prices . But recognize that a bet on Europe and Japan is a bet on substantial change  --  both in government policies and in corporate management . Will it happen ? I think so , but the revolution is n't tomorrow . <p> Still , my advice is to own foreign stocks  --  through funds like Polaris Global Value or others I have mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julius Baer International Equity ( BJBIX ) , both of which have been awarded five stars ; Oakmark International ( OAKIX ) ; and Forward Hansberger International Growth ( FFINX ) . <p> What proportion of your portfolio should be foreign ? More than mine . <p> Somewhere between 10 and 20 percent sounds about right , and there is nothing wrong with making a global fund such as Polaris a core holding , even though slightly less than 50 percent of its holdings are American . If you like the companies , multilateralism is a perfectly sound policy . <p> James K.
