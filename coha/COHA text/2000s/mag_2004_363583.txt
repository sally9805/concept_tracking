Lasik eye surgery , today performed almost exclusively on adults , can help children with amblyopia , or lazy eye , according to a small study in the British Journal of Ophthalmology . All six children in the study were very nearsighted , but five also suffered from amblyopia that did n't respond to such standard treatments as glasses or patches . Two years after surgery and postoperative patching , the vision of the five kids had vastly improved .
