Nature 's perfect plant makes a comeback Headnote Hemp vs . Marijuana Headnote The plant genus Cannibas is made up of several variants , all of which contain molecular compounds called cannabinoids . One form of cannabinoid is tetrahydrocannabidnol ( THC ) , the psychoactive ingredient that in great enough levels can produce a " high . " The cannibas variant that is high in THC is marijuana . The variant that is low in THC is called industrial hemp . " The THC levels in industrial hemp are so low that no one could get high from smoking it , " writes David P. West , who holds a PhD in plant breeding from the University of Minnesota . " Moreover , hemp contains a relatively high percentage of another cannabinoid , cannabidiol ( CBD ) , that actually blocks the marijuana high . Hemp is not only not marijuana : it could be called " antimarijuana . ' ' " Even so , the 1970 Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act , while repealing the Marihuana sic Tax Act of 1937 , perpetuated the 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making all cannibas cultivation illegal by establishing a zero-tolerance level for any THC in hemp plants . Photograph // In a cluttered storefront on Main Street in the quiet Mennonite community of Blue Ball , Pennsylvania , Shawn Patrick House pulls a faded print from a stack of old magazines , sales brochures and posters . The print , from a photograph taken on September 24 , 1908 , shows a farmer in a broad-brimmed hat , long sleeves and suspenders , riding along on his mechanical mowing machine behind a team of white horses . Standing tall behind them , and fallen in rows at their feet , are acres of hemp , once a mainstay of the American agricultural economy . " Since the 1600s , all Dutch and German farmers in this area grew hemp to make ropes , sails and ship riggings , fabrics and oil , " House says . " But an entire way of life has been wiped out . Farmers are hurting , and more and more of them are turning to carpentry or other trades . It should n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other products made from hemp grown in Canada , the thirty  --  something Pennsylvania native is determined to revive Lancaster County 's economy and introduce a new generation to a crop that decades of misguided governmental policy have all but destroyed . The war on commercial hemp-rooted in the belief that commercial hemp and recreational marijuana are the same thing-is a tragedy not only for farmers but for consumers . If hemp is not nature 's perfect plant , it is as close as we may ever come to it . The North American Industrial Hemp Council estimates that more than 25,000 products can be manufactured with hemp , from cosmetics to auto-body parts . The first diesel engine was fueled by hemp oil , found inside hempseeds . The seeds are used to make foods such as bagels , corn chips , breads , cookies and animal feed . The oil can be used in skin lotions , moisturizers , shampoos , lip balms , paints , inks , sealants and varnishes . The fiber , taken fm the outside of the stalks , is versatile too . Fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are made from the fiber , while the stalks are used in teabags , fiberglass and plastics . " Hemp is our most versatile and environmentally benign crop , " says Albert Lewis , owner of Hempy 's , a San Diego manufacturer of hemp  --  based clothing and accessories sold in the United States , Canada and Japan . " It 's a natural fiber and a renewable resource that can be grown organically . " " The government 's opposition to hemp defames mankind 's single most useful , nutritious plant , " says Richard Rose , author of The HempNut Health and Cookbook and founder of HempNut , Inc. , a Northern California food company with sales in the United States , Canada , Europe and Japan . House believes his Hempzels are far more nutritious than conventional pretzels . " Mine are made with whole wheat , shelled hempseed and organic brown rice and no preservatives , " he says . " They 're a great source of protein , fiber and omega  --  3 fatty acids , essential for healthy metabolism , brain cell development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these healthy foods represents a huge challenge . Hemp has been associated in the popular consciousness with marijuana since the late 1960s and remains tainted by that connection . Despite hemp 's illustrious past  --  George Washington grew it at Mount Vernon , Betsy Ross sewed her American flag with it and Benjamin Franklin owned a hemp mill  --  hemp-growing in this country was regulated out of existence starting in the Great Depression , when the Marihuana sic Tax Act of 1937 was passed . The only exception to the crackdown was in World War II , when supplies of hemp fiber , obtained from the Philippines , were interrupted , and a wartime Hemp Industries Board encouraged its cultivation for military use . A million acres of " Hemp for Victory " were grown and , after the war , when hemp could be obtained from overseas again , the government sold its mills for surplus . In 1958 , the last industrial hemp crop in America ceased operations . // The recreational drug use of the ' ' 60s only steeled the federal government 's determination to make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marijuana are two different plants-the latter has 30 times as great a narcotic content-the federal government regards them as identical . You ca n't " get high " smoking commercial hemp , as policymakers in more and more agricultural states have come to realize . A number of states have asked Washington to relax its restrictions , and others have commissioned studies to assess hemp 's commercial potential . Eager to use hemp in building materials and as a source for ethanol , Hawaii is working with the federal government to plant hemp under an experimental program . How long it will take to reverse decades of prejudice is anybody 's guess . Until laws change , American manufacturers will continue to import hempseed flour and fiber from Canada . " To outlaw one crop because its cousin has psychoactive properties is crazy , " says Frank Angiuli , co-owner of Santa Monica 's Natural High Lifestyles , which supplies hemp  --  based clothing to yoga studios and high-end retailers like Fred Segal and Urban Outfitters . " You can make opium out of poppies , but the government does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " If the government would change the laws , hemp would certainly thrive . " Rose urges caution . " Sometimes the reaction to the government 's policies has been as counterproductive as the government 's policies themselves , " he says . " For a time , the only hemp food being produced was cooked up by some dread-locked guys in their kitchens in Oregon because hemp 's connection to marijuana was cool . ' That did n't help , nor have some pro-hemp activists who 've oversold its potential . We must deal with the realistic possibilities of a serious agricultural crop that has real uses and will find real markets . " Hip-Again Hemp In New Holland , five miles down back roads from House 's storefront , is Garden Spot Distributors , which supplies about 1,000 hemp products , mostly in dry bulk , to several hundred health-food stores from Cleveland to the East Coast . Garden Spot 's 13,000-foot warehouse sits across the road from a field where a four-horse team patiently works the soil . Against a backdrop of well-kept barns , silos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycles . Laundry billows from clotheslines , drying in the afternoon sun . A boy working a garden wears a very grown-up-and unseasonable-felt hat . It 's ironic that so trendy a cause as hemp finds its epicenter in such a traditional culture . Garden Spot carries House 's products , but not nearly as eagerly as he 'd like . " As soon as I can , I 'll bring in more , " Matt King , a Garden Spot project manager , tells House as they huddle on the loading dock , discussing markets and warehouse space . " Right now , there 's not a lot I can do . " If House is disappointed , he does not seem discouraged . " I never believed this would be easy , " he says . A combination manufacturer 's rep , marketing consultant and industry educator , he has been knocking on doors since 1997 , when he introduced a novelty item , Nitanny Lion Lip Balm , manufactured from hempseed oil for Penn State football fans . Since then , he has branched out into hemp-based cookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hempola , Nutiva , Hemp Basics and other manufacturers . He has learned to be flexible and patient . Small hemp-based companies like his have a tough time competing with more established brands . " Because they have no economies of scale , their prices are higher , " Agiuli says . " They need the backing of larger companies , but they are afraid they 'll alienate existing customers by having anything to do with hemp . Small companies also operate in a regulatory environment that 's totally uncertain . " Among the Plain Folk At the roadside Dutch Country Bakery , hot pretzel sticks are rolling off a conveyor belt , where Mennonite girls in long dresses and bonnets sell them three for $2 . " We 've got a big following among the Plain Folk , " says owner Ike Stoltzfus , whose ovens turn out 10,000 pretzels a day , most of them sold in 150 stores in Ohio and Pennsylvania . In two weeks , Stoltzfus will put through another batch of Hempzels , which make up a small but cherished portion of his commercial  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struggling , " House admits . " But I feel like Bill Gates in the early days of Microsoft . Hemp today is where the soy industry was 30 years ago , when nobody 'd heard of it . This is the future . " That may be .
