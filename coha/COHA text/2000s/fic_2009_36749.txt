Sagamore Hill , Long Island , New York , June 1900 <p> The tiger glared at Brian Donovan , its jaws stretched wide enough to engulf his head . He rubbed it with his boot and swirled his glass of lemonade , grateful for the reassuring chink of ice cubes on such a hot day . Teddy Roosevelt had at least a dozen other hunting trophies here , plus hundreds of books . They could send his conversation off in a thousand unpredictable directions . <p> Heat and sunlight filtered into the study through the white-draped windows , closely followed by children 's laughter . He 'd have some kids of his own soon , as soon as he found another good Catholic girl his folks would approve of . But the next one would be reliable , unlike that money-grubbing Mary FitzAllen . <p> The governor of New York cast a wistful glance over his shoulder then dropped two massive tomes onto his desk . " Heard you 're about to leave for Europe , Donovan . " <p> Brian regarded him from under his brows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rough Rider , he 'd answered his old colonel 's summons as soon as it was received . " Yes , sir . I plan to join my parents and younger brothers in Berlin . My brother 's trapped in Peking and they 've been pushing the European governments to build a unified army . " <p> And paying bribes . They 'd transferred all the family 's cash reserves to Switzerland , in case it would help . <p> " So they 've been helping merge together that combined force . " <p> " It was the only way to rescue the diplomats besieged in the embassy compounds , which is where we believe Neil is . " <p> Sweet Jesus , may he still be there and alive . <p> " With those peasants rampaging across all of China-I 'd like to see exactly how they earned the name Boxers ! - it 'd take a sizable command to get those folks out and back home . Your family 's to be commended for helping pull it together . " <p> Brian shrugged the compliment off and waited , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco , waiting for word from Neil . He did n't need any reminders of how helpless he 'd felt while his parents had been working the European capitals . He 'd been sitting there for weeks , playing every string of the family 's connections across China and the Pacific to no avail , fighting for any news of Neil . <p> At least he could move into action now , thanks to that asinine European decision to give Russia command of the army 's secondary wing . Why the devil could n't they give it to somebody with fewer Asiatic ambitions-like France or Italy ? But no , it had to be Russia , who was always so desperate for gold and land that there was no telling what their troops might do . Charge into battle without orders , just to take a useful port or loot a city ? Many of their soldiers were only half-disciplined , too , dammit . <p> He 'd seen it happen once before , on the far side of India 's Northwest Frontier . A business trip there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played mercilessly between Britain and Russia for control of Central Asia . No brother of his would be caught in the backlash of Russia 's troops going out of control , if he could help it . <p> Only Europe still held any traces of the orders given to those Russian troops . When he 'd received the cable asking him to come to Paris , he 'd immediately handed everything off to his uncles . They could watch for news out of China as well or better than he could . <p> But nobody else in the family had the experience to sniff out the smallest signs of Russian ambition and follow them to their source . He was damn glad to go hunting overseas to help block any potential threat to Neil . <p> " You speak German , do n't you ? " <p> Why the devil was he bringing that up ? <p> " Fairly well , yes . " <p> " Ever heard of Eisengau ? " Roosevelt swung around a straight-backed chair to face him and straddled it . <p> " I have one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in subject . Eisengau was known for weaponry , not the size of their army . <p> " What sporting man does n't ? " snorted Roosevelt , making his guest grin . <p> " It 's supposed to be a small place , on the northeastern fringes of the Alps . " Brian shrugged off his disinterest . <p> " Which designs and sells the best cannons in Europe . " <p> Truly ? As well as shotguns ? <p> " Why should that make me interested ? " He was a civilian now . <p> " Do you think the same lazy fools who gave us those slow-moving rifles in Cuba will find their way there for some good cannons ? " <p> Brian froze , his lemonade halfway to his lips . " Hardly , " he admitted . <p> He shot a hard look at his former commander , who he 'd known since earliest childhood . That was something to be said for family connections : he could ask a question and expect a straight answer . " Why do you bring it up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for Vice-President . " <p> " On the same ticket as the incumbent President . " <p> " That 's no guarantee of being elected , " Brian reminded him . <p> Colonel Roosevelt harrumphed and flung himself to his feet , never one to sit still for long . " Somebody has to go there and see what they 've got to offer . " <p> " Why the hurry ? " <p> " There 's a rumor they 've got a gun as big as anything on a battleship . " And being an old Navy man , Roosevelt would have heard about it . <p> " The War Department wo n't look into it , " Brian guessed . <p> " Not quite . " Roosevelt smacked a big fist into his palm . " They simply do n't have the money to buy it . Eisengau runs an auction at their army 's summer maneuvers where the atmosphere is lax- " Enough to make Roosevelt , who 'd been uncovering political corruption for decades , mention it ? Amazing - " and bidding can run very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former Under-Secretary of the Navy cautious ? Ouch . <p> " Budgets are tight and Congress is out of session-and you , sir , have no authority . " Brian sipped his lemonade again . Dammit , he was n't a soldier any more , charging up a hill with bullets whistling through his shirt . Nobody could make him do anything , especially not when this was somebody else 's responsibility . Like the rest of his family , he needed to go help his big brother . <p> Still , if there were that many countries visiting Eisengau all at once , it might be a very good place to find out what the Russian half of the Peking relief force was actually supposed to do . <p> Roosevelt 's lips compressed . He hated being reminded of limits . " We can arrange for you to be temporarily back in the Army . The War Department has unearthed some loopholes in the regulations . " <p> Brian blinked , caught totally off-guard . Become a major again ? <p> " You have the money to compete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The younger man eyed him disbelievingly . Go on his own ? " But I 'm not an artilleryman . I would n't know a good cannon from a mediocre one . " <p> " You 're a smart man and you know explosives . Buy what looks interesting and bring it back here for the experts to decide . " <p> " Just because I 'm rich . " Yes , he could undoubtedly indulge in a cannon or two out of his own pocket . <p> But why should he pull the War Department 's bacon out of the fire , after the way they 'd left the regiment to rot and die in Cuba without medical supplies , in exchange for making the Spanish surrender ? <p> " Remember San Juan Hill ? " Roosevelt shifted to an orator 's coaxing croon and he leaned forward . " All those hours when the Spaniards had us pinned down and our men were wounded and dying along the road and in the fields . " <p> Oh shit , and the smells . Brian nodded , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery came up . Old-fashioned artillery , using black powder , the same as they used forty years ago . Those guns opened a way for us to take that hill . " <p> " Without them , we 'd probably be dead . " God knows he relived that scene time and again in his nightmares . He rose and leaned against the bookcase , head bowed before the picture of Roosevelt 's beloved father . <p> " Just go to Eisengau , major , and see what they have . " Brian 's shoulders instinctively straightened at the sound of his wartime rank . " If there 's nothing , come home . But if you find something interesting , buy it and Congress will reimburse you . " <p> " Are n't you exceeding your authority or something-sir ? " Brian swung around . <p> " If I 'm not elected , then your family connections will certainly look after you . " Roosevelt thumped his desk , making the tomes jump and fall over . " And the next bunch of American soldiers who go into battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And they would n't have to die , rotting within hours like pigs , the way his friends had . Never again , not if he could help it . <p> He 'd swing through some of the European capitals on the way , just to see what he could hear about the Russian intentions . Then , off to Eisengau to sift every last gossipy tidbit from the all the drunken soldiers there . Somewhere , somehow , somebody had news that would help Neil . <p> " Are you in , Major ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> Brian snapped to attention and saluted . <p> Eisengau , July 1900 <p> Meredith quickly took the last steps down into the square from the college , her long black academic robe whipping around her ankles . Her neatly strapped books swung from her hand , ready to be hidden away for the summer , and her headdress 's ribbons brushed her forehead . In the grand duchy 's modern capital , only female college students wore traditional headgear-and only during the school year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with her black velvet robes , to spare her mother and stepfather any reminders of their increasingly unpleasant bargain . <p> After four years , she still had n't brought home a fiancT . Her opposition to doing so had grown as firm as her parents ' determination to force her into an advantageous marriage . Only their income from keeping her in school kept the atmosphere remotely civilized but that had become an ever-narrower bridge across a deep chasm . <p> Stiff linen nudged her waist , arguing that she quickly complete her sole errand . Oh , she would , she would . She 'd finally had the chance to take action and she 'd seized it . <p> She grinned privately and scanned the old market square for her best friend . She 'd won their private race and reached the rendezvous point before he expected her . <p> Intricate old buildings framed the great expanse , currently filled with a multitude of vendors . They sold anything a housewife could desire , starting with food , and the aromas made her mouth water . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in front of a store , they were the gaudiest specimens Eisengau could provide and very popular . <p> There ! A sturdy black dog raced in circles around the drinking fountain with several other dogs , all of them leaping in the air to catch droplets of water . <p> Meredith threw her head back and laughed . She was n't the only one glad to see semester 's end . She could hardly wait to tell her friends what she 'd done . Now the grand duke would have to listen to them . <p> Morro 's head snapped up and he barked a joyous welcome . He twisted , changing direction in mid-air , and raced toward her , dodging between obstacles rather than around them . <p> She grinned and waited for him , her best and oldest friend . She 'd buy him a meat roll to celebrate her secret treasure , once she turned it over to be safely hidden . <p> A whir and a long drum roll brought the great clock , pride of the ruling dynasty for three centuries , whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Town Hall 's bell tower , careless of the humans below them . Church bells began to ring across the city , once after another , announcing the noontime hour . Tomorrow St. Martin 's Church in Old Town would hold its weekly concert , reminding everyone who 'd gained the largest organ in town thanks to the last war . <p> Flower vendors hastily straightened their wares , while scared cabbies whipped up their horses and raced for safety , desperate to escape the ban on being caught in New Town by foreigners . They disappeared under the great barrel-vaulted colonnades , originally built to keep businesses above the great spring floods which regularly ripped through the entire valley , and into Old Town 's narrower , winding streets . Only the ancient floodwall protected the historic quarter , not broad avenues and squares , or deep underground drains . <p> The train blew its whistle sharply once , then again on a long , breathy sigh . Steam oozed out of the station and slid down the tracks , veiling Paris Avenue and Eisengau 's Old Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , barely tolerating another view of the daily injustice . She was never sure whether to race through the square at this hour or delay long enough to avoid the train from Berlin and Paris . <p> Crimson tile rooftops marked houses and shops clinging to the crag below the Citadel . Only a few , privileged newcomers would be permitted to ascend the narrow roads cut into the Iron Mountain and journey to the ducal palace , sprawled like a sated python over the rock . Black smoke slowly spiraled into the sky behind the cathedral 's gothic spires , as it had for all the millennia since swords were first beaten out against the peak 's unyielding heart . <p> And that made everything completely normal in Eisengau-or " Iron Mountain " in German . <p> Morro planted himself in front of her , tongue lolling out from between his teeth , just as the clock sounded its final note . Perfect timing , as ever . <p> " You marvelous boy , " she crooned and bent to scratch his head behind the ears . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark sent her stomach diving for her boots . For a moment , her head spun . Remember , he ca n't see through your robes , she reminded herself fiercely . <p> The massive , curving bulk of Colonel Heinrich Zorndorf , Eisengau 's chief cannon designer , almost blocked the sun . Taller than most men , his waist measurement nearly equaled his height . His nose was as sharp as a vulture 's rapacious beak , his mouth was as tight as a python 's grip , and his jaw jutted like a tiger 's strike . But his eyes were as sharp as a saber 's edge . <p> " Colonel Zorndorf , " she acknowledged and rose slowly to her feet . She plastered a smile on her lips , hoping it looked like her usual polite , patient version . <p> " They will be working tonight at the foundry . " <p> " Again ? " The betraying word slipped out before she could stop it . Morro whipped around , planting himself between the two of them . <p> Travelers streamed past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's three consecutive weeks when perfection is required ? " He frowned at her , his bushy eyebrows beetling under his spiked helmet . <p> When they 've been laboring at least fourteen hour shifts and have n't had a single day off ? <p> " I 'm sure all will end well . " She 'd learned long ago what she could , and could not , do . Openly disagreeing with him was profitless . She shifted her books , nudging her elbow against the linen tied around her waist . <p> Oh please , let him not notice that my robes are much thicker than usual ... <p> " You will need to observe and take notes . " <p> " Tonight ? After dark ? " She gaped at him . The foundry was almost five miles outside town . She went there regularly during daylight-but at night ? For a properly bred girl to walk there alone during those hours was unheard of . <p> " Of course . My name is all the shield you need . " He threw back his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that implied she was either his mistress or his fiancTe ! She could hardly tell him her friends at the foundry would protect her . She should simply say her mother would never agree . She opened her mouth to object . <p> A soft , rumbling growl rose from Morro . <p> " I will be attending Grand Duke Rupert 's reception for our foreign visitors , " he went on . " Such a pity you ca n't attend that instead , since the company there will be very warm . " <p> Zorndorf leered down at her , his gaze running over her body like a slimy glove . It lingered on her bosom and traveled lower , scrutinizing every fold for clues to the female form hidden underneath . What if he realized she 'd abruptly lost her normally trim waist ? <p> Dear God , what if he guessed she was carrying the plans for Eisengau 's magnificent new cannon , strapped around her waist ? She had to end this . <p> " Yes , of course , I 'll do my duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to visit her friends now , rather than wait until this evening 's workers ' party central committee meeting . But she should be able to catch Liesel at home and Liesel could hide the plans for her . <p> " Excellent , I knew you were a good girl . " He reached out to chuck her under the chin and she stepped back quickly . Morro deliberately did n't follow immediately , causing Zorndorf to almost trip . By the time her boss recovered , she was standing a few paces away with her very innocent canine companion at her side . Four years of working for the pig had given them far too much practice in that move . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
