There are two things about Korea you never forget . The first is the roiling mishmash of stinks.That May , there was the bitter stench of tear gas , an essence of spring and fall , since Korean students are what you might term fair-weather protesters . There was the ripened aroma of kimchi , a spiced and aged cabbage that makes your nostrils think your upper lip 's plagued with gangrene . On top of that was the acrid odor of garlic , the lifeblood of every Korean . Finally , there were all the smells of careless progress : smog , construction , and human sweat . The second thing you never forget is exactly how miserably steamy a Korean late spring day can be . My shirt was pasted to my back before I got halfway across the tarmac to the flight building of Osan Air Base . I dashed straight through the entry and shoved aside a sputtering Army captain who was rooted like a potted plant waiting to meet and greet me . " Major Drummond , I , ooof- " was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I heard him skittering along behind me . I moved my stiff legs as fast as I could , till I spied the door I so desperately sought . I lunged through hard enough to blow it off the hinges ; the captain scurried right behind me . At the urinal I got my zipper down not a moment too soon . Another millisecond and the jig would 've been up . My escort propped himself against the sink and studied me with an awed expression . " Jeez , you should see your face . " " You got no idea . " " Long flight , huh ? " I put my left hand against the wall . " Long ai n't the half of it . Know whose neck I 'd like to wring ? The miserable bastard who broke the only toilet in the C-141 . I 've had my legs crossed since the Alaskan border . " " Well , you 're finally here , " he consoled , grinning like a fool . " I guess I am . " A full , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My name 's Chuck Wilson . I , uh , I 've been told to pick you up and escort you to Seoul . " " Hey , that 's great , Chuck.Why ? " " Huh ? " " Why are you taking me to Seoul ? Why am I in Korea in the first place ? " An exquisitely befuddled look popped onto his face . " I got no idea , sir . Why are you here ? " The stream of urine flooding out of my body had not abated one bit . I got worried . Has anybody ever pissed himself to death ? I did n't ask him that , though . I said , " If I knew that , why the hell would I be asking you ? " He glanced down at his watch and said , " You okay , Major ? It 's been over a minute . " " No , I 'm not okay , " I complained . " My hand 's tired . This damn thing 's so big and heavy . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We both chuckled a little too emphatically , like real men do whenever any topic arises even remotely touching on homosexuality . " Sheeit , " he drawled in a deep , manly way , " some things a man 's got ta do hisself . " " Damn right , " I firmly pronounced . The stream of urine flooding out of my body had not abated one bit . I got worried . Has anybody ever pissed himself to death ? I did n't ask him that , though . I said , " If I knew that , why the hell would I be asking you ? " He glanced down at his watch and said , " You okay , Major ? It 's been over a minute . " " No , I 'm not okay , " I complained . " My hand 's tired . This damn thing 's so big and heavy . Can you come over here and hold it for me ? " We both chuckled a little too emphatically , like real men do whenever any topic arises even remotely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a deep , manly way , " some things a man 's got ta do hisself . " He averted his eyes while I gave Ol ' Humungo a manly shake , reholstered , and got my zipper back up . " Okay , " I said , moving to the sinks and splashing some water on my hands and face , " let 's find my bags and get outta here . " " Forget the bags , " he said . " My driver 's getting ' em . " We went out , and a husky young corporal named Vasquez was standing proudly beside a spanking-new black Kia sedan with lots of gleaming chrome.I made him open the trunk so I could peek in , and sure enough there sat my duffel bag and oversize lawyer 's briefcase.Then Wilson and I climbed into the backseat . " Well , ai n't this the plush life , " I remarked , running an admiring hand across the leather upholstery . " I figured you 'd get me in a nasty old humvee . " " Not unless I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He gave me a curious look . " Have n't you been reading the papers ? " I said , " Hey , Chuck , see these shorts and this ratty T-shirt I 'm wearing ? " " Yes sir . " " This is what 's called formal attire in Bermuda . See , that 's where I was until , uh , oh " -I looked at my watch- " until about twenty-eight hours ago.Know what 's so great about Bermuda ? No ? Let me tell you : No newspapers . No TVs . No cares in the world but which beach has the skimpiest bikinis and which bar 's having a two-for-one special at happy hour . " He nodded right along . " Yeah , well , things are n't so blas over here . We 're drowning in anti-American riots . It 's gotten so bad we 're restricted to our bases . No civilian cars with U.S. plates and no unescorted military vehicles are allowed outside the gates . " " That why we 're in this Kia ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on letting me come get you . I asked for a helicopter , but , no offense intended , they said you just were n't that damned important . " " A helicopter ? " I asked , beginning to think this captain was a little over the edge.This was South Korea.These people were our allies , not our enemies . Sounding not the least bit contrite , he said , " I know it sounds crazy , but , hey , the American embassy got firebombed two days ago . The ambassador actually got beat up . Bad , too . He had to be medevaced to Hawaii . " With the worldly resignation of one who has spent some time in Korea , I said , " Look , anti-American riots are a popular local sport . You must be new . Trust me , Chuck , you 'll get used to it . " Three seconds later , I ate my words . We 'd just crested a long , steep hill , and the back gate of the air base loomed only twenty yards ahead.The roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a shower of rocks that struck like pistol shots . I looked through the front windshield and saw three Molotov cocktails come sailing , end over end , through the air.Two exploded on the tarmac directly ahead.The third grazed off the trunk of our car and erupted right behind us . Two dozen military policemen were careening through the gate , flailing hopelessly with their nightsticks , shoving backward , and being chased by a huge mob of Koreans . I 'm no expert on riots , but I 've seen a few . I once watched a bunch of Somali provocateurs trying to get a rise out of some American peacekeepers.That was a taunting kind of riot , not really meant to harm the peacekeepers ; in fact intended to achieve the opposite : to get the peacekeepers so riled up they 'd do something harmful to the crowd and end up looking like bad guys.The idea was to provoke an atrocity . And as someone who lived through the Vietnam era , I witnessed my share of antiwar riots.Those " riots " were actually more like big frat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope and to get laid.Those kinds of riots , everybody walks on eggshells , and they do it in a real fretful way , because both sides are praying the other does n't do anything stupid . Atrocities are the last thing anybody wants . The mob bearing down on us looked to be the third kind of riot : the bad kind of riot . The folks in this crowd had menace in their eyes and mayhem on their minds . Their faces were snarled with anger and hatred , and a lot of them were carrying bats , or Molotov cocktails , or throwing big stones . By the guardshack , two MPs were down , and several Koreans were gathered around kicking and beating them like they were snare drums . Corporal Vasquez , the driver , jammed down hard on the brakes . He rubbernecked around to face us . " Hey , Captain , what do ya want me to do ? " Wilson craned forward and peered through the windshield.He rubbed his jaw thoughtfully and studied the situation , and looked more thoughtful . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I yelled . " Huh ? " Vasquez asked . " Go ! " I yelled . Vasquez turned out to be my favorite kind of soldier : the hairtrigger obedient type . He spun back around , downshifted into neutral , jammed the gas pedal to the floor , then shifted into gear.The car nearly leaped off the ground . The tires screamed as they got traction , and Vasquez wisely shoved down hard on the horn , adding to the racket . All of a sudden the mob focused on the big , noisy black sedan bearing down on them.That look of the maddened crowd evaporated . I guess they realized there 's a fundamental difference between chasing a group of outnumbered , scared MPs and eating the front bumper of a speeding car . Rioters dove all over the place.We raced through the narrow gate , then Vasquez took a hard right turn , with more squealing tires , and drove madly through a bunch of skinny twisted streets with tightly packed shops on both sides . It took about three minutes before we cleared the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the Seoul-Pusan highway . Captain Wilson 's fingers had a death grip on the back of Vasquez 's seat . His face was chalky white . " You should n't have done that , " he moaned . " That was a real bad idea . " " How come ? " I asked . He shook his head and gave me an exasperated look . " ' Cause we 're gon na get an official complaint . No doubt about it . You coulda hurt some of those people . " " Hey Chucky , you got things backward.They wanted to hurt us . Besides , Osan Air Base is military territory.We have an agreement with the South Koreans.Those people were trespassers . If we 'd hit one , it would 've been perfectly legal.Trust me . " He gave me a dubious look . " What makes you so damn sure of yourself ? " " I ought to be , " I told him . " I 'm a lawyer . " " A lawyer ? " he asked , like he 'd just discovered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoe . " Yeah , you know . A JAG officer . One of those guys with a license to practice law . " His face got this very pained expression . " You mean ... you mean , I went through this shit to get a JAG officer ? " With the tension and all , he just blurted that out . I did n't take offense , though . See , in the Army , JAG officers are n't real high on anybody 's **30;352;TOOLONG lists . We 're regarded as geeky , bookish , wimpy types without a lot of redeeming virtues . Lawyers are n't all that popular in the civilian world , either , but at least they inspire envy with the money they earn . Military lawyers , nobody envies us.We shave our heads and dress somewhat funny , and our pay 's only a hairsbreadth away from minimum wage . I leaned back into my seat and crossed my recently tanned legs . " So what 's got the natives up in arms this time ? " Wilson let loose his grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened was that three American soldiers raped and murdered a South Korean . " " That 's too bad , " I said in a casually offhanded way . " Regrettable , I 'm sure , but that kind of thing 's happened over here plenty of times.Anything special about this one ? " " I 'd say . " " What ? " " It was a fag rape . " I nodded , but " Umm-hmm " was all I said . " That 's not the least of it , either.The kid they raped and murdered was a Katusa . " I nodded and umm-hmm 'd some more . Katusas are South Korean soldiers assigned to American units.The term actually stands for " Korean Augmentees to the U.S. Army " - more proof that the military can convolute anything into an acronym . Katusas are almost all highly educated college graduates who speak English if not fluently , at least with some degree of proficiency . Most Korean kids consider Katusa duty to be the most agreeable way to perform mandatory military service . With good reason , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like the American Army back in the thirties , where a common soldier 's lot is fairly spartan . The pay stinks , the barracks are rustic and unheated , the food 's just enough to keep you from starving , and Korean sergeants believe fervently that if you spare the rod , you spoil the child . Hazing and beatings are fairly common . The American military , on the other hand , is inarguably the world 's most spoiled and pampered . Barracks are like college dorms , food 's .... well , at least ample , and if a sergeant so much as raises an open hand in the direction of a private , he 's going to need a good defense counsel , like me . Naturally , any Korean kid with an iota of sense wants to be a Katusa . And just as naturally , any Korean kid with rich or powerful parents usually gets his way . I looked at Chuck . " I can see where that would be ugly . " " You do n't know the half of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katusa 's name was Lee No Tae . Of course , since nearly everybody who lives here 's named Lee or Kim , I do n't expect you to see the significance of that . His father is Lee Jung Kim . Ever heard of him ? " " Nope . " " He 's the defense minister of the South Korean armed forces . " I felt a sudden wrenching in my gut . I mean , here I am , a JAG officer , and I get this panicky call from the Judge Advocate General , the two-star general in charge of the entire Army 's JAG Corps , ordering me to terminate my vacation and haul my butt up to Andrews Air Force Base to catch the next military flight to South Korea.Worse , he would n't say why . He just said I 'd find out when I got there . It was my turn to squeeze the back of the seat in front of me . " Has this got anything to do with why I 've been brought over here ? " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , sounding completely resolute . " Not a thing . " " Yeah ? How do you know ? " " ' Cause , according to the papers , the Organization for Gay Military Members-some group back in the States-hired a bunch of civilian attorneys to come over here and represent the accused . " A relieved sigh escaped from my lungs . I do n't mean to sound squeamish , but in my eight years as an Army lawyer , I 'd managed to never once be involved with a court case related to homosexuality . There are n't a lot of experienced military lawyers who can say that . I could , though . I was damned glad of it , too . The thing about flying twelve hours with my bladder pumped full of coffee and that six-pack of Molson I now sorely regretted having smuggled aboard was that I could n't sleep for fear I 'd awaken with a big wet spot in my lap . I smelled foul and was wrung out , so I told Captain Wilson to wake me up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
