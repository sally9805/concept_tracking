Mary Matalin may be just as well known as her boss , but that 's not a notion the sharp-tongued former co-host of CNN 's Crossfire wants to entertain . Drawing attention to oneself is frowned on in Dick Cheney 's button-down world , in which the erstwhile TV opinionista is counselor to the Vice President and assistant to the President . Cheney , the ultimate company man , believes that no underling , including himself , should be too eager to discuss his work for the " principal , " George W. Bush . <P> And so the woman who for years would n't zip her lip declined to discuss her role for this story and asked that it not be written ( cc : Vice President ) . She is delighted to be back on the inside  --  and wants to stay . A disciple of the late Lee Atwater , a G.O.P. strategist known for his bareknuckle style , Matalin was deputy manager of Bush Sr. 's ' 92 campaign , but " she 's never worked in a White House , " says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The decision has n't sat well with her equally partisan husband , James Carville . With two kids under six , her job means more Mr. Mom duties for the vein-popping Cajun who helped elect Bill Clinton in 1992 . It also means a serious drop in family income . Carville and Matalin 's mix of celebrity , romance and adversarial politics has been a lucrative formula  --  joint speeches , talk-show gigs  --  since their public courtship during the ' 92 campaign . <P> Matalin 's marriage drives some Republicans crazy . Not only does she consort with Democrats , but her views on some issues , like abortion and homosexuality , place her to the left of social conservatives . If some Republicans question the sanity of marrying a Clinton-loving Democrat , none doubt her fierce loyalty to the G.O.P. or her devotion to the Bush family . As an unpaid adviser to Bush 2000 , Matalin remained his relentless booster on CNN , an arrangement she never saw as a conflict . Former President Bush has said that toward the end of his failing re-election bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign who thought he still had a chance  --  proof that loyalty can sometimes lead to blindness . <P> Although Matalin is close to the President , she remains even closer to his father , whom , friends say , she called almost every day during the 2000 campaign . That partly explains how she ended up as an adviser to the man who was the elder Bush 's Defense Secretary . It was Cheney 's daughter Liz who called Matalin after the election and asked if she would consider working for the Vice President . Matalin jumped at the chance . <P> Inside the White House , she defers to Karen Hughes and Karl Rove , Bush 's top political and communications aides , and to Andy Card , the chief of staff . But as Cheney 's adviser and a force in her own right , she is considered a major player . Though she 's keeping a low profile in public , Bush aides say she 's more like her true self on the inside . " She 's very smart , and she 's brutally honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's not an a kisser . She 's not a yes person . She 'll tell it like it is . Every White House needs someone like that . " <P>  --  By J.C . and J.F.D.
