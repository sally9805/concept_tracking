// The young nurse was puzzled as she studied the sick child in the poor little cabin . It was 1909 and Elizabeth Kenny was a nurse in the Australian bush . She had been trained to serve this wild country that was without doctors and was sprinkled with ranches that were far apart . She had a horse and a territory that was ten miles square . There were no telephones . Cowboys brought her word , and she rode where they directed . She had been taught to help mothers with their babies , give first aid in accident cases , and treat sick children . But this was a disease that she had never seen . The little three-year-old girl lay whimpering , her leg bent at the knee . When Elizabeth tried to straighten it , the child cried out and the leg jerked back into its bent position . How could she treat something she did n't understand ? She needed advice . The nearest doctor was a hundred miles away , but the telegraph station was only two miles . She rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had counted Dr. Aeneas McDonnell as her friend ever since he had set her broken wrist when she was eight . Now , having described the child 's symptoms-headache , mild fever , stiff neck and back , she waited for his answer . At last the telegraph clicked out fifteen words : DISEASE IS INFANTILE PARALYSIS . NO KNOWN CURE . DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR THE SYMPTOMS . Infantile paralysis , later called poliomyelitis ( polio for short ) , means little to young people today . To most , it 's just one of the shots that they get . But many parents and grandparents remember well the frightening epidemics of the 1940s and 1950s . Every summer parents lived in fear : Will polio strike ? Will our children get it ? Will they be crippled for life ? Nurse Kenny had never had the opportunity to read the medical books that described polio-how a virus killed nerve cells in the spinal cord , causing paralysis and contractures ( deformities ) . Dr. McDonnell had said : " Treat the symptoms . One symptom was pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elizabeth drew from her nursing knowledge and remembered that heat relieves pain and relaxes . She tried a bag of hot salt , but it was too heavy . A poultice was too sticky and not hot enough . What would work ? The child 's mother had an old wool blanket . Elizabeth tore it into strips , dipped them into water that was boiling in the fireplace , wrung them almost dry , then wrapped the steaming wool pieces around the little girl 's legs . The child sighed and went to sleep . A message arrived . She was needed at another ranch to treat two other sick children . " Keep putting the hot compresses on just as you saw me do it , " Nurse Kenny said , as she prepared to leave . " Change them whenever they get cold . " When she returned a week or so later , Elizabeth found the little girl free of pain and her leg straight and supple . " Want to get up ? " asked the nurse , helping the girl to her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenny scooped her up and examined her to see what was wrong . The muscles on the front of the thigh were not working . They would n't hold the leg straight enough for the girl to stand . That 's odd , thought Elizabeth . Those were n't the sick muscles . It was the muscles behind the knee that were sore . Now her leg muscles are so weak that she has forgotten " how to use them . I 'll have to show her how . She picked up the little girl 's leg and rubbed the muscles . " This is how it should move , " said Elizabeth . She gently bent the child 's leg and then straightened it . " Now , you try it . " The little girl frowned , but made an effort . Slowly , the leg became straight . Nurse Kenny helped the child to her feet . She stood , then took a step . She smiled as she took another . " You 'll be all right now , " said Elizabeth , and she rode off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Kenny made a rare trip to town and saw her friend , the doctor . " How did all your infantile paralysis patients do ? " asked Dr. McDonnell . " Good , " Elizabeth // answered . " I had six and they all lived . " " Fine ! " he exclaimed , then hesitated . " How badly are they crippled ? " " Crippled ? " asked the puzzled nurse . " What do you mean ? " " Patients as bad as you described are always crippled by paralysis or by contractures , or both . " " No , " she said . " All six are fine . " The doctor was astonished . " What did you do ? " " You said to treat the symptoms , ' so I did , " said the nurse . " I put hot packs on the muscle spasms to relax them . And when the patients " forgot " how to use their muscles , I helped them learn how again . " The doctor consulted his medical books . " These say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But I saw the spasm , " protested Elizabeth . " I relaxed the muscles with heat . The children got well . " Dr. McDonnell looked thoughtfully at young Elizabeth Kenny . " I think that you have made a great medical discovery , " he said . " Persist , and some day the great cities of the world will honor you . " The doctor 's prophecy would one day come true . Before Elizabeth Kenny could do anything more with her discovery , World War I began . She enlisted with the British Army and was soon promoted to Sister . She sailed with Australian Soldiers to help Britian , but was wounded in France . She would be called Sister Kenny the rest of her life . After the war , she returned to nurse polio victims in the city hospitals of Australia . As Dr. McDonnell had predicted , she met with much opposition . Doctors did not want to listen to a nurse who had seen what they had not . They did not trust a treatment not in their medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , only children already crippled , whom she could help a little , but not cure . When she did treat an acute case with good results , they said , " But your patient did not really have polio . The fact that he recovered proves it . " Sister Kenny continued to learn about polio as she worked . Always she tried to see the symptoms and find treatment that would help . She learned that sometimes muscles were paralyzed when the virus killed their nerve cells . Sometimes only part of the cells died , leaving a weak muscle that could be strengthened . Much apparent paralysis was " forgetting , " and she could retrain those muscles . The worst permanent paralysis happened to patients who had exercised strenuously during the time they were falling sick . Early rest and gentle nursing helped prevent this . She discovered that spasms , not " muscle imbalance " as the books said , caused deformities . Untreated muscle spasms hardened into contractures and pulled the body crooked . The best treatment was still her first-wool hot packs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear . Free of deformities , patients could make the best use of what they had left . Many could learn to walk gracefully even with some paralysis . // It took twenty-five years of hard work and frustration for Elizabeth Kenny to win general acceptance in Australia . In 1941 she came to America . In Minneapolis three doctors-Dr . Cole , Dr. Pohl , and Dr. Knapp said , " You may treat our patients and we will watch . We want something better than we have had . " Soon Dr. Pohl said , " How much more comfortable the patients are with this treatment ! Pain disappears quickly . " Later he added , " The results are better too ! " By December 1941 , the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis had accepted her treatment , and Sister Kenny had become famous . Doctors came from all over to watch her work . Nurses and physical therapists also came to study . The city of Minneapolis gave her a hospital . Trained Kenny therapists went to work at the sites of epidemics in other cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle spasm . They tested the muscles electrically . " These muscles show much more activity than normal , " they said . " Spasm is real ! " All polio patients had spasm , but only some had paralysis . Spasm occurred before paralysis . Did n't this mean that the polio virus was in the blood before it reached the spinal cord , she asked . As long as scientists believed that the virus went directly to the spinal cord , they had no hope for a vaccine . But , if the virus circulated in the blood , medicine could reach it . It was well worth trying to develop a polio vaccine because these were the days of the terrible epidemics that hit here and there in America and other countries every summer . Tens of thousands of children were stricken , some to die , some to be paralyzed , and some to be crippled for life . People felt badly when they saw a crippled or paralyzed child . They gave money to the March of Dimes . Doctors treated patients , nurses cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helped patients make good recoveries . Still the toll was heavy . Scientists worked furiously to find a vaccine . At last , success ! In 1953 , Dr. Jonas Salk announced a polio vaccine . Soon thousands had received " polio shots . " Dr. Albert Sabin made a polio vaccine that you could take by mouth on a sugar cube . Polio dwindled from tens of thousands to a few cases a year . Elizabeth Kenny died in 1952 at her home in Australia . This once obscure bush nurse , using her eyes and her resourcefulness , had found a successful treatment for this terrible disease and had helped scientists find the clue that led to the vaccines that conquered polio . // <p>
