<p> The prisoner faces a video camera , folded arms exposing a Grim Reaper tattoo . He slumps back in his chair , and begins to talk , almost casually - about murder . <p> " I had a gun ... , " he says , " a starter pistol . " <p> His narrow eyes are weary , his forearm muscles twitch , his tone is matter-of-fact as he describes , in a rambling drawl , a winter day long ago . <p> " I rolled the window down and she come over to the passenger side . " <p> The prisoner says he drove to a wooded area , parked his car on a dirt road , and forced the girl out . <p> " I made her take her clothes off , and I strangled her ... , " he says . " I hit her in the head with a rock . Then I put a piece of , I think it was like a refrigerator door , or some kind of large sheet metal ... over her and ah , some other debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is silent , finally . <p> The detective asking the questions is content . He has waited years for this moment . His suspicions , he believes , are now confirmed . <p> On this April day in 1997 , this man , already convicted of a murder in Arkansas , says he abducted and killed a 17-year-old girl near Battle Creek in 1983 . <p> And yet this confession did n't end a mystery . It began one . <p> While the prisoner spoke , another man already was behind bars for the murder . <p> He still is . <p> If this were detective story fiction , there might be a stubborn cop who rides a hunch , locks horns with the higher-ups and doggedly pursues the truth until justice prevails , the bad guy is behind bars and the innocent man walks free . <p> Real life is messier . <p> This story has a real detective , Dennis Mullen , big as a linebacker and headstrong as they come , who plunged into a murder mystery , clashed with prosecutors , thought he had uncovered a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This story revolves around two men . <p> Thomas Cress , who is mentally disabled , is the one serving a life sentence for killing 17-year-old Patricia Rosansky . He has maintained his innocence and passed a lie detector test . <p> Michael Ronning , the tattooed Arkansas murderer with Battle Creek roots , is the man who confessed to Mullen that he killed the girl . He , too , passed a polygraph . <p> As this strange case has unfolded , witnesses have recanted or been accused of railroading Cress for a $5,000 reward , a judge has reversed his own decision to allow a retrial , critical evidence that might have determined the real killer has been destroyed . <p> And Mullen quit police work in frustration . <p> Cress recently appealed for a new trial . For now , he sits in a Michigan prison that serves inmates with mental problems . He has battled depression and suffered a nervous breakdown a few years ago . <p> " I have done half my life in the penitentiary for something I have n't done , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I have to say . " <p> The inmate with Coke bottle-thick glasses and a receding hairline pauses a moment . <p> " I think the evidence supports the fact I 'm not guilty , " he adds . " You just ca n't tell a lie and get away with it . " <p> Tom Cress lived on society 's fringes . <p> He delivered newspapers , did carpentry , even sold neighbors discarded cereal boxes from a Kellogg 's plant . He could n't read or write and had the mental capacity of an 8-year-old . He was a petty thief . And he drank a lot . <p> In 1983 , Cress lived a few doors from Patricia Rosansky , but says he barely knew her . <p> The teen-ager was within view of her high school , heading to class , when she disappeared in February 1983 . Her partially clothed body , covered with garbage and leaves , was found two months later . Her skull was crushed ; she had been sexually assaulted . <p> Nearly a year after the killing - but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and said Cress bragged about committing the crime . <p> They testified at his 1985 trial , but there was no physical evidence - not a blood stain , fingerprint or fiber - to implicate Cress . <p> These were pre-DNA days , so there were no sophisticated tests for semen recovered or four hairs that Rosansky was clutching . Both sides agreed the hairs were not from Cress . <p> Cress had an alibi : He was delivering papers at the time . A co-worker vouched for him . <p> At trial 's end , Cress was convicted and sentenced to life . <p> By 1992 , his appeals had run out . <p> But that same year , a stranger offered Cress new hope . <p> Michael Ronning was a killer . A jury had already concluded that . <p> But how was this Arkansas inmate connected to a long-ago murder hundreds of miles away and a man he says he does n't know ? <p> Dennis Mullen had a theory . <p> Having investigated about 80 homicides over three decades , Mullen always looked to the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve if you talk to enough people and walk enough , " he says . " I do n't get frustrated easily . " <p> But this one frustrated him . <p> All the walking and talking in the Rosansky case led him to one conclusion and prosecutors to another . Frustration turned to disillusionment , and this spring Mullen quit the police , convinced his name had been muddied and his efforts to discover the truth thwarted . <p> Over 12 years , Mullen came to believe Cress did not kill Patricia Rosansky . Instead , he thought , evidence pointed to Ronning . <p> His ex-supervisor , Joe Newman , then one of the top men in the Battle Creek department , agrees . " We feel like we have never been able to bring the truth forward , " Newman says . <p> Mullen first heard of Ronning in early 1986 after Arkansas State Police charged the former Michigan man with the murder of a 21-year-old abducted from her home in Jonesboro , Ark . <p> Her body was found 40 miles away and , like Rosansky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ronning was convicted and sentenced to life . <p> Mullen says Ronning 's wife , Vicky , told Arkansas cops the couple had lived in a Battle Creek apartment building a few years earlier when a woman was murdered . <p> Mullen had worked that case . Maggie Hume , 20 , was found in her closet , strangled and sexually assaulted , covered by clothes . <p> The detective started piecing together a puzzle . He learned Ronning abruptly left town the day of the 1982 Hume murder . And he discovered that shortly after Ronning arrived at a cousin 's home in Texas , a teen-age girl also living there disappeared . <p> Years later , squirrel hunters found that girl 's skeleton in a field , covered with roofing shingles . A surveying crew found the skeleton of another girl , a runaway , 800 yards away . Police in Bedford , Texas , consider Ronning a suspect in both cases . <p> The puzzle was taking form . <p> Mullen approached Ronning in Arkansas . He refused to talk . <p> But Vicky Ronning did talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old warrant . <p> She told Mullen about the couple 's nomadic life . Some days , Ronning would rush home , tell her to pack up , and by night they 'd be living in a new state . California . Florida . Michigan . Arkansas . They were always on the move . <p> She recalled that on the night of the Hume murder , Ronning wore a pair of moccasins , Mullen said ; she later identified them in a Sears catalogue . They had a crisscross sole pattern - matching the shoe print on an air conditioning unit below the balcony to Hume 's apartment . <p> But Mullen did n't have enough to make a case . <p> In time , his attention turned to two other murders in the area : Karry Evans and Patricia Rosansky , both 17 , abducted within weeks of each other on their way to school , their bodies found in the woods . <p> Mullen did n't see a coincidence , but a pattern . <p> And he knew someone was in prison for killing Rosansky . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he thought , " would be a horrendous thing . " <p> In January 1992 , Mullen visited Ronning again in Arkansas . <p> Afterward , he wrote in a report that Ronning had insinuated himself in as many as six murders and " could clear the man that was in prison on the Rosansky murder . " <p> At the time , Mullen and Newman say , Jon Sahli , then prosecutor in Michigan 's Calhoun County , knew Ronning might have killed Rosansky . <p> No , Sahli says , he knew only of a possible Ronning link to the Hume case . <p> Exactly who knew what was more than academic . <p> In May 1992 , Sahli signed a routine State Police request seeking permission to destroy all evidence in the Cress case . Police said Cress ' appeals had been exhausted and they needed storage space . <p> The evidence included hair and semen samples that had never been tested for DNA . But advances in science had since made that possible . <p> That summer , Mullen says , Sahli said nothing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tied to Rosansky 's murder . <p> It turned out that even then , the evidence still could have been tested ; it was n't burned until that fall . <p> This year , Michigan Sen. Carl Levin , supporting a DNA evidence preservation bill , condemned Sahli 's decision in congressional testimony , calling it " an egregious violation of fundamental fairness . " <p> Sahli maintains he did nothing wrong . If police had told him about Rosansky early on , he says , " I would not have had the evidence destroyed . " <p> As years passed , Mullen grew more frustrated . <p> Once he and Newman visited Cress in prison and told him a bogus story : They were profiling killers , they said , and had some questions . Maybe , Mullen thought , he would confess . <p> " I 'd like to help you guys , but I did n't do it , " Cress replied , according to Mullen . <p> Years later , Cress passed a lie detector test when denying he killed Rosansky . <p> In 1996 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders . He was given a polygraph . <p> When asked if three were the number of people he had killed in Michigan - no names were mentioned - he answered yes . <p> The examiner 's conclusion : Ronning was telling the truth . <p> Ronning 's videotaped confession to the Evans , Hume and Rosansky murders came the following spring . <p> Accurate in some details , he was mistaken in others . <p> Ronning indicated there was no struggle with Rosansky , when there was a fierce fight , says Nancy Mullett , an assistant prosecutor . <p> He did n't know the crime scene when taken there , changed his mind on what he did with the clothes and did n't mention the body was in a ravine near the Kalamazoo River , even though he had grown up in the area , she adds . <p> Ronning had hoped to work out a deal with prosecutors : He would plead guilty to any murders he had committed in Michigan . In exchange , he would serve a life sentence there so he could be near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about his credibility . <p> Mullett believes Ronning got information from news and police reports and some inadvertently from Mullen , who she believes rushed to judgment . <p> But why would someone falsely confess to murder ? <p> " To keep the focus on him , " Mullett speculates . " ... To be considered notorious . " <p> Others see legitimate reasons for Ronning 's inconsistencies : He was high on drugs at the time of Rosansky 's murder , 14 years had elapsed and a rural road where the body was found had been developed with shops and a church . <p> What does Ronning say ? <p> " I was honest and forthright in the statements I made , " he says in a telephone interview from prison in Arkansas . " What about the details that I got right ? " <p> The confession did give Cress a new chance for freedom . <p> A new lawyer , David Nickola , became convinced his client was innocent . " He 's a perfect patsy because of his simplistic ways , " he says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's confession and an interview Mullen conducted with an original prosecution witness . She told the detective Cress never talked to her about killing anyone and believed her sister implicated him for the reward . <p> Later , this witness would claim Mullen had pressured her to recant . <p> A man also testified that a second prosecution witness - who later committed suicide - told him he and the two women falsely accused Cress . <p> In December 1997 , Calhoun County Circuit Judge Allen Garbrecht ordered a new trial . <p> Prosecutors appealed , challenging details of Ronning 's statements , raising questions about Rosansky 's injuries and presenting family members who said Ronning told them he never killed anyone in Michigan . <p> Ronning 's response : " I freely admit I lied to family members , to friends , to other people . " <p> Fifteen months after his first ruling , Judge Garbrecht reversed himself : No new trial . What the judge found most compelling was Ronning 's inability to find where the body had been found . <p> Ronning , the judge said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing to take another lie detector test , <p> " I feel for this guy that 's in prison , " Ronning says . " But I did n't put him there . The legal system put him there . ... I have done my best to bring closure to everyone involved in this . " <p> Are these the words of a serial killer or a manipulative liar capable of hoodwinking seasoned cops and a string of lawyers ? <p> And is Thomas Cress a murderer , or a victim of a system that refuses to admit it made a mistake ? <p> Awaiting a decision on his request for a new trial , Cress says he tries not to think too much about the outside world because it makes him too depressed and he could end up back in the prison hospital . <p> " I ca n't get my hopes up , because if you do and it 's a big letdown , then you might do something stupid , " he says . <p> " I used to be angry but I stopped that because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be angry at nothing .
