I try not to judge , but from the get-go , I did n't like Albert 's friend . Kirk Atlas , not his real name , was twenty-seven years old . He was already rich but that was n't enough . He wanted to be famous . It was 9 P.M. , January , a cold winter . I was sitting under red lights in the overheated cabin of a luxury yacht called La Pinta , docked at City Island , not far from what used to be Tito Puente 's Restaurant . The music of 50 Cent banged out from overhead speakers , filling every corner of the room . Atlas sat , bopped his head and waved his arms in time to the music . <p> " I aim straight for your head ! " sang Atlas . Then he whispered in Albert 's ear . <p> Kirk Atlas was of indeterminate ethnicity , with a shaved head that glistened like a dull gold . His torso was the size of a mini fridge , packed tight into a five-foot-six-inch frame . He was bare-chested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore Puma sneakers on his feet and dark Versace sunglasses , a tattoo of a black panther etched above the word " Gangsta " on his forearm . On the long glass coffee table was an empty bottle of Havana Club , dirty ashtrays , a can of Coca-Cola , and a .45 . <p> Like I said , I did n't like the guy . <p> Atlas was a phony . Not a gangsta , a wangsta : wannabe angster . Phony should n't bother me . I 've chased all kinds of folks , from Queens to Brighton Beach , from Brooklyn to Southern Boulevard , from the South Bronx to St. Marks , from Manhattan to West Brighton . <p> A lot of people are phony and wicked and cruel . It should n't bother me . But it does . <p> Atlas finished whispering in Albert 's ear and sat back smugly on the plump leather sofa , smoking a Cuban and drinking rum from a crystal glass . He beamed at me like I was a camera ready to snap his picture . <p> I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still in a red waiter 's jacket and black bow tie , puffed nervously on his fat cigar and slapped my knee . " Chico here can be trusted . He was one of my best friends at St. Mary 's . " <p> " When was the last time you and Albert saw each other ? " Atlas asked , turning down the hi-fi system by remote . <p> " New Year 's Eve with you on Fordham Road , " I said . " At your restaurant . " <p> " I mean , before that ? " said Atlas . <p> I looked at Albert . " Over twenty years ago . " <p> " Still live in the Bronx , right ? " said Atlas . <p> " I was raised on Brook Avenue , " I said . " But I live in Pelham Bay now . " <p> " What were you doing on Fordham ? " <p> " I go on a walkabout around the Bronx every New Year , " I said . " Been doing it since I was a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff of his hand-rolled cigar . He studied my face . " What 're you , Dominican ? " <p> " Puerto Rican . " <p> Atlas laughed and looked at Albert . " A Puerto Rican from the Bronx . That 's rare , huh ? " <p> " Yeah , " I said , glancing at Albert . " Like unicorns or Bigfoots . " <p> " I like you , Chico , " said Atlas . " I think we can do business . " <p> " What kind of business ? " <p> " I need you to find a girl for me . " <p> " Who does n't ? " I said . <p> " Sense of humor , " said Atlas , leaning forward . " I like that , too . " <p> Atlas examined my face again . " So you 're pure Puerto Rican ? " <p> " No such animal , " I said . <p> " Well , " said Atlas and put his feet up on the long glass coffee table , " when you walked into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " <p> " Sometimes a spade is a spade , " I said . " What 's your story ? " <p> He smiled . " I 'm a lot of things . " <p> Kirk Atlas removed his dark sunglasses and stared at me with cold green eyes . He looked like a blanco , a white man , maybe northern Italian or Russian , or maybe some kinda Spanish . There was an almost imperceptible accent in his voice . <p> " What 's the accent ? " I asked . " What accent ? " He looked as if he was going to jump out of his skin . <p> " I hear an accent . It 's slight , but it 's there . " <p> " I do n't have an accent ! " <p> Atlas looked at me like he wanted to kick my teeth in and gave Albert an annoyed glance . Albert tapped my knee and said , " Chico , relax . " <p> " I thought we was all friends here , " I said . <p> Atlas got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . <p> Albert laughed and said , " Chico , relax . Marco  --  " <p> Albert stopped himself . Atlas turned and glared at him , because Albert had slipped up and started to say Atlas 's real name  --  Marco something . Real cloak and dagger stuff . <p> " I need your name , Atlas , " I said . " Your real name or I hit the yellow bricks . " <p> Albert looked at me , sweating like a man who had stolen something . " Kirk here is one of my oldest friends , after you , Chico . Kirk 's got his reasons fer bein ' so stingy with information . He 's got a career to think about . " <p> I had bumped into Atlas and Albert on Fordham Road at the Chinatown Angel , a restaurant owned by Atlas . Albert , a waiter there and a wannabe filmmaker , announced that his old buddy and current boss Kirk Atlas was on his way to fame . Atlas had just appeared in a commercial for salad dressing , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-budget science fiction flick . Albert was directing . It was called Doomsday . <p> I 'm not sure what being an action star has to do with salad dressing , but I 'm not in show business . I 'm a private investigator . Or , I was . Before my wife , Ramona , kicked me out . I quit my job at the private investigator 's agency St. James and Company and buried myself in a basement apartment for six months . The good news ? I quit smoking and drinking . I had only just come up for air on New Year 's Eve . That 's when I bumped into Kirk Atlas and Albert Garcia . <p> It seemed to me that Albert was acting strange . He looked anxious and irritated . If you were a lightning bug on the wall of that yacht , you 'd see that Albert Garcia did n't match the ritzy surroundings at all . Albert was short , like Atlas , but older . He had crooked teeth and a scraggly beard . His oily hair stood up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from back in the day at St. Mary 's  --  he was a moody street kid , a fearless little South Bronx Napoleon with a bad temper who was n't ashamed to scratch , bite , and deliver a nut-shot in a fight with a bigger kid if he had to . Also , he was one of the few boys at St. Mary 's who knew comic books and movies as well as I did . <p> " I 'd like to keep my real name private , " Atlas said . " It 's not personal , dude . I got ta watch the ol ' publicity machine . My agent wants me to be an enigma . " <p> I thought maybe being an enigma had something to do with being a liar . I did n't say that , though . " Name . " <p> " Marcos Rivera , " said Atlas , grinning tough . " I 'm Cuban . Well , my folks are Cuban . I 'm American . Kirk Atlas is my Hollywood thing . " <p> Atlas turned to check his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie posters : Harrison Ford 's Blade Runner and Vin Diesel 's Pitch Black . A collection of Kirk Atlas 's Hollywood dreams and fantasies , which included himself at the center . <p> Albert went into his jacket and came up holding something . He handed it to me . It was a photograph . <p> I studied it . It was a publicity shot of a stunning young girl playing a violin . She was Asian with dyed blond hair and green eyes . She looked a bit like that movie star of another era , Veronica Lake . <p> " She 's Asian ? " I said , holding up the photo . <p> " Yeah , " said Atlas and turned from the mirror , eyes narrowed . " Chinese . What ? Are you prejudiced ? " <p> " Only between the hours of nine and five on Monday mornings . I 'm workin ' on it . " <p> " She 's only half Chinese , " said Albert . <p> " Half Cuban , " said Atlas . " Her name is Tiffany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and green eyes called Tiffany , " I said . " I thought I had issues . " <p> I looked at the photograph again and then at Kirk Atlas . <p> " What do you want with her ? " <p> Atlas 's mood changed . He got a depressed look on his face and took a slug of his rum . He paused . <p> " Tiffany is my cousin , " said Atlas . <p> " She 's my girlfriend 's little sister , " said Albert . <p> " I 'm looking for your girlfriend 's little sister ? " I asked Albert . Albert got a tense look on his face , and then he relaxed . He winked at me . <p> " Tiffany 's sister Olga is at Columbia University . Pre-law . Brainy and high strung . I do n't want her involved in this . " <p> " Never mind about Olga , " said Atlas . " Tiffany and I are very close . More than blood , more than just family . At least , I thought so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know that she 's okay . " <p> " If she 's missing , " I said , " why do n't you call the police ? " <p> " Not that kind of missing , " said Albert . <p> " She 's eighteen , " said Atlas . She took an official leave of absence from Julliard . She packed one bag and a violin . She left a note . Does n't wan na see or talk to anybody . No family . Not even her closest friends . She writes postcards to say she 's fine . But there 's no return address . " <p> " Smart girl . " <p> " Smart ? " Atlas bragged . " This girl can ski , snowboard , ride a horse , shoot a gun , and play a violin like an angel . " <p> " An angel that shoots guns ? " I said . " Bro , obviously , we grew up in different churches . " <p> Atlas pulled out a wad of cash . He placed it on the glass table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not too shabby . Once upon a time I had the luxury of turning down investigative work , but now I was behind on the rent , the light , the cable , the cell phone , the car repair bills , and gas was going up to twenty dollars a gallon . I had quit my job , and I counted only eight hundred dollars in the sock I kept under my bed . I still had a choice , you always have a choice , but the wiggle room was tight . <p> Albert handed me a small passport photo of a man in a dark business suit along with a card . <p> HMD Financial <p> Samuel Rivera , President <p> 43rd Street , 5th Avenue <p> " Samuel Rivera , " said Albert . " Tiffany 's father . Kirk 's uncle . Ever hear of him ? " <p> " No , " I said . " But I travel in small circles and low places . " <p> " Tiffany is Samuel 's favorite , " said Atlas . " I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You follow Tiffany 's father , " Albert said . " I think you 'll find her . " <p> " All I want from you is an address , " Atlas said and pushed a red button on the wall . " I 'll do the rest . " <p> A pretty black girl wearing a snug tuxedo that accentuated her ample curves entered . She was holding a second bottle of Havana Club . She smiled flirtatiously at me , and Atlas gave her an irritated look . She appeared so quickly that I knew she must have been standing outside the door , listening . <p> " Allo , Albert , " she said , with a sweet giggle . " Tudo bem ? " <p> Albert did n't say anything . He just nodded his head politely . <p> Tudo bem . I recognized it . Brazilian . My wife , Ramona , and I used to go to Little Brazil or Rua 46 in Midtown for black bean stew and caipirinha . <p> " Everything 's fine , " said Atlas , glaring at Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pour ! " <p> She looked at me with a lingering and confident eye . I checked out her hips as she passed and poured Atlas some more rum . <p> As I grabbed and sipped my Coca-Cola , Atlas threw Albert a second wad of money . Everybody was getting a taste . But I noticed that Albert was scowling as he pocketed the cash . <p> He looked agitated as he talked excitedly about some of the films that had been shot on City Island . Butterfield 8 with Elizabeth Taylor , Awakenings with Robin Williams , A Bronx Tale with Robert De Niro . Brazil pretended to just be clearing the glass table . But I could tell she was eavesdropping . She came over and tried to fill my glass . <p> I shook my head . " I do n't drink anymore . " <p> " Cigar ? " <p> " Do n't smoke anymore , either . Thank you . " <p> " What your name is ? " she whispered . <p> " Chico . You ? " <p> " Pilar , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I go off soon . " <p> " In that case , " I said , " I 'll wait for you outside . " <p> She smiled and nodded . <p> I looked over at Atlas , who was flexing his muscles for Albert . Oh , yeah , Kirk Atlas was a real prize . <p> Atlas , grinning , suddenly hopped over and slapped Pilar 's bottom with a hard thwack ! <p> Pilar did n't even flinch . She just kept smiling . Albert opened his mouth as if he was going to say something in protest . But he did n't . Albert was n't saying a lot of things . <p> As Pilar left with the first empty bottle of rum and a dirty ashtray , she bowed to Atlas . She actually bowed  --  bent at the waist , head down , eyes to the floor , walking backward , behind up in the air , primed for kicking . But hell , the things I 've done for money . Who knew what her story was ? Uno nunca sabe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Albert and Atlas raised their glasses to me . I raised mine back . I try not to judge . <p> But sometimes it gets real hard . <p> Excerpted from CHINATOWN ANGEL by A.E . ROMAN <p> Copyright 2009 by A.E .
