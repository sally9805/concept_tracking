FOCUS IS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING to the surveyor . Squinting into the transit 's eyepiece and turning the knobs to center the cross hairs and magnify the details , you apprehend only a tiny framed circle of reality . It 's like peering out of a tunnel , or the barrel of a gun : The rest of the world becomes peripheral and unimportant , fading into the dark that surrounds the bright , round fragment you can see . Later , doing the calculations , you focus on exact numbers : the degrees , minutes , and seconds of an angle ; the miles , feet , and tenths of distance ; the coordinates that define a precise point of intersection between the abstract and the concrete , between doing the math and running the line . Because a good survey is the result of an almost compulsive attention to detail , it 's easy to forget the big picture : what it means , why it 's done , how it fits in . It 's easy to forget what all those bearings and distances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most surveyors this is n't much of a problem . If you do your work well , the numbers slowly assume the shape of something tangible and familiar : a highway , a house , a white picket fence . But if you 're a government surveyor  --  as I was each summer during my college years , surveying the public domain for the Bureau of Land Management  --  the problem of focus becomes more serious , because the lines you run add up to something substantial . The BLM 's Manual of Instruction for the Survey of the Public Lands told us only what we needed to know : The lines we measured added up to thirty-six-square-mile grids called townships , each township 's boundary connected with others to throw a precise net over the broad expanse of America . The Manual helped us understand that the field notes we sent in were translated into maps and documents that served a larger national purpose , but we seldom paused to consider the audacity and ambition of our work , the fact that our lines defined quite literally the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We worked entire summers without questioning the reasons for spending our days imposing western civilization 's most prized artifact  --  the straight line  --  upon the irregularity of natural landscape . <p> One summer we were assigned the rare task of an original survey  --  of the Kaiparowits Plateau , an obscure and isolated landform that represented one of the few remaining blank spots on BLM 's land-status grid of Utah . We appreciated the departure from our usual work ( we spent other summers retracing century-old survey lines in order to replace eroded rock markers with more durable steel ones ) , and after examining from a helicopter the twisted and chaotic expanse of southern Utah desert we 'd been assigned , we spent the evening wondering over beer just what the central office had in mind . Then we began our work , began to focus on specific lines , on particular problems of mathematics or logistics , and were only jogged into context with the arrival of visitors from the central office , men in white shirts and ties who had driven the length of Utah to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us why we were there . <p> Our most frequent visitor was Woodrow Sylvester , the man in charge of government surveys in Utah . Woody carried the anachronistic title of Deputy U.S. Surveyor the same way he wore his bushy white mustache and hand-tooled cowboy boots , as if it actually meant something to be in charge of surveying one of the few states left with unmapped terrain . There was something a little forced about his swagger , and yet something authentic , too . He was in the dark the way deskbound bosses are always in the dark , never quite knowing what his workers actually did ; yet his quick speech and medium-priced cigar somehow spoke beautifully to what we accomplished in the field and how our work connected with what they made of it in the office , the ways in which we contributed to the vast project set in motion by the Land Ordinance of 1785 , Thomas Jefferson 's imposition of Enlightenment ideals on the previously unenlightened landscape of North America . Woody 's job was to negotiate between the hard and dirty world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , and the lingering imperatives of the American Experiment , and he did this very well . He managed to get answers from Washington that nobody else could , and he managed to keep his troops more or less in line . <p> We were more closely supervised by another Sylvester , Woody 's brother Craig , a man who 'd worked even longer in the field than Woody but had remained a surveyor , had stubbornly resisted being kicked upstairs . Unlike Woody , Craig had not the slightest whiff of the office about him , even though by the time I met him  --  the summer we inscribed into the Kaiparowits Plateau the mandates of the Land Ordinance of 1785  --  he was spending more time in the trailer doing calculations and writing reports than trudging alongside us in the field . <p> Several days a week , however , Graig would travel among the crews , providing answers in a way that made no one feel stupid for asking the questions . He would chain-smoke his way through the problems we brought him , shaking a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his lips , sucking it into ash without ever touching it until he dropped the butt on the ground and carefully rubbed it into the desert with the toe of his boot . He offered solutions to problems ranging from balky chainsaws to failed calculations , talking us through slowly and quietly , his directions softened with phrases such as " I believe I 'd ... " or " You might try .... " The summer temporaries , me included , thought he was the smartest man in the universe . <p> It was difficult for us to understand how two brothers could be so different , but as is sometimes the case , the family history helps . According to Woody , the original Sylvesters had been sent to southern Utah in 1864 for a specific purpose : The family patriarch ( a recent arrival in Salt Lake City from England ) had been called by Brigham Young on a mission to lead a Danish settlement named Elsinore into a more fluent partnership with the other Utah colonies . The Danes had been baptized in their homeland by missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chartered by the Church , and led in wagons and handcarts across the increasingly arid breadth of America to the Mormon Zion . After a brief rest in the relative comfort of Salt Lake Gity , the Danes were exiled to one of the blank spots that remained on Brigham Young 's map , a hot , dry corner of the Sevier River Valley just off the wagon road that connected a string of Mormon outposts stretching ambitiously all the way to California . There they were left to figure things out for themselves , to translate the Prophet 's vague mandates into the building of a community , to farm the desert according to the agricultural traditions of Scandinavia . <p> This was a joke nearly as cruel as Iosepa , a desert ghost town that was once home to a mournful assortment of Pacific islanders . Mormon missionaries had sailed to Hawaii , waded ashore with their valises in one hand and the Book of Mormon in the other , and while availing themselves of the hospitality for which the islands were famous had patiently taught their hosts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had encountered in a shadowy woodlot in upstate New York ( Iosepa is Hawaiian for Joseph ) . Like the Danes , the islanders had been brought to Zion and sent to colonize an unsettled corner of Utah Territory , in their case a west-desert depression named Skull Valley in recognition of the unburied Indian skeletons found there by Mormon cattlemen . The town of Iosepa was laid out on terrain so parched and godforsaken as to make Elsinore seem tropical , and a good number of the islanders died within the first several years . Many survivors returned home ( the Mormons eventually fortified their empire in the Pacific by constructing a temple in Hawaii , providing the permission the islanders needed to end their exile ) ; more than a few remained in Skull Valley , however , becoming inmates of Iosepa 's next incarnation  --  Zion 's first leper colony , the cluster of frame buildings providing the combination of shelter and isolation required for lepers to linger and die . This brief experiment left enduring scars in the slow-healing landscape of Skull Valley : You can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement of streets laid out in a grid oriented to the cardinal points of the compass , the familiar crisscrossing of straight lines and right angles adored by Brigham Young with an intensity matched only by Thomas Jefferson 's . <p> Things turned out better for Elsinore . The central office acted with more wisdom in saving Brigham Young 's Danish experiment  --  word of the Danes ' sunburned , frostbitten , and culture-shocked condition had made it back to Salt Lake City before they actually started dying  --  and according to Woody , Young sent his personal representative , Woody and Craig 's great-grandfather , to show them the way . It must have worked , because Elsinore is today a thriving and comfortably assimilated community , the central square presided over by a prosperous brick chapel , the perfectly square blocks lined with modest but neat houses . <p> You do n't have to search century-old records to understand the reasons for Elsinore 's success : You can see from their leader 's descendants , Woody and Craig , just what the original Sylvester was made of , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make of Elsinore something not so melancholy , a place more productive , more English , as a first step toward becoming , finally , more American . Surely it was part bullshit and part competence ; it was a lot of keeping in touch with the central office , and a lot of good common sense . It required short , clear answers that bypass the obstacles of language and culture , directions that tell you how to force together an empire from the most alien materials . The brothers had just inherited different traits . <p> We respected Craig Sylvester , even revered him , but we loved Woody . It was difficult to carry on a conversation with Craig : You 'd ask a question , and he 'd answer it . Woody would n't wait for a question  --  he 'd flood you with information , with stories , with gab . Woody would visit his crews two or three times each summer , and always he 'd arrive with the bright-eyed and nervous manner of a hyperactive child : He was smiling and smoking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , order steak and eggs in the cafe , piss on the truck 's front tire after the long , jolting drive to the field . He 'd look through the transit , offer unasked-for advice , talk about other surveying jobs , problems on other townships , telling us we were the best crew , with the highest scores on civil-service exams and the most energy and initiative . As we did our jobs  --  turning angles , measuring distances , cutting back vegetation for the clearest shot  --  he 'd tell stories  --  his cigar smoke keeping the gnats at bay as he talked  --  of the old Government Land Office days , surveying on horseback during the ' 30s and ' 40s . <p> Around noon he 'd say , " Let 's head in , boys , " and that 's what we 'd do . There was drinking to be done , and it was best begun early . He 'd buy rounds in a bar until five , then switch to scotch in his motel room , then we 'd eat dinner at the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a meal of rare steaks and the requisite number of scotch-rocks , Woody would tell us about his wartime experiences , the years he 'd spent surveying the suddenly strategic Tonga Islands , a jungle paradise deep in the South Pacific . <p> Even today I have only a vague idea what this actually meant . I suppose I grew up believing everything I read in our family 's World Book Encyclopedia , which explained that Woody 's wartime experiences were played out in an archipelago " sometimes called the Friendly Islands because of the happy and carefree ways of the people . " I knew that in the nineteenth century , Mormon missionaries had baptized and imported significant numbers of Tongans , and that the Salt Lake City police department currently ranked Tongan gangs among its more serious inner-city problems , the most recent expression of the unease with which Pacific islanders have occupied the Utah landscape . <p> But as Woody told his stories , it never occurred to any of us to ask : Why survey Tonga ? Perhaps we did n't ask because we were surveyors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the reasons for our work . Perhaps it was because we wanted nothing practical or even plausible to detract from the vision he portrayed of a tropical utopia . Long after Woody had returned to the central office , we 'd dreamily reconstruct the landscapes he 'd painted in the smoky barroom air . We 'd imagine a deep , translucent jungle , thick green leaves , white flowers , dense canopies that filtered light like stained glass , a canvas painted by Henri Rousseau . We 'd place in this paradise a young , rakish Woody , his eyes shaded by a pith helmet and aviator sunglasses , sporting a thin black mustache and smoking a long , thick cigar , one arm around a brown , black-haired , bare-breasted Gauguinian girl , the other reaching for a new bottle of Cutty , another arm ( this was an icon we were constructing ) stretching gracefully to twist the knobs on the transit , turning the angles necessary to shoot the Southern Cross . <p> Woody spoke fondly of the Southern Cross , that constellation pointing the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its near-perfect northness a point in the universe that defined truth and constancy , at least for surveyors . But the Southern Cross was something else , a cruciform arrangement that echoed the transit 's cross hairs as Woody oriented himself , focused , and extended his line straight through the jungle , all the while basking in the warmth of the southern hemisphere , summer when it was winter in Utah . Cases of scotch , blue lagoons , half-naked and unresisting women . The way Woody described it , surveying in the South Pacific was as easy and natural as fucking . <p> Reflection has a way of complicating the simplest images , even bare breasts , cases of scotch , the Southern Cross . I 've spent a lot of time thinking about Woody and his wartime experiences , and about my own time with the BLM . Each fall when I made the awkward transition from surveyor of public lands to student of world literature , I 'd think hard about what I 'd been doing for the preceding three months : I 'd go from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Abbey 's advice , yanked them from the ground . As I came slowly to understand just how Western , how European , is the laying out of grids  --  how connected this practice is to the displacement of native populations that favored circles over right angles , people who took comfort in cycles of growth and return and found little to recommend the cruel linearity of Judeo-Christian thinking , the triumph of mathematics over flora and fauna  --  Woody 's surveying of Tonga started seeming less like myth and more like history . <p> Missing from our fantasy was the fact that his work was somehow linked with a world war , with the storming of white-sand beaches , the mining of peaceful lagoons . I thought more and more about traditional cultures caught in the cross hairs , the indiscriminate shelling of enemy emplacements and native villages alike . I wondered about the role surveying played in the military , and my curiosity was prodded and complicated by other unexpected connections between the Pentagon and the BLM : For example , why was the best user 's manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild T-2 theodolite  --  a U.S. Army publication , part of a series that included a volume describing the operation of the Claymore M-18A1 Antipersonnel Mine ? And it meant something , though I did n't know quite what , that the helicopter pilots who flew us to the field were usually Vietnam veterans , small , wiry men who flew fast at treetop level , scanning the terrain through slitted , suspicious eyes as if the trees and bushes concealed resistance , the unsurveyed landscape a threat to our lives . <p> It was another visitor from the central office who provided some context for considering this problem . Roy Koerner was about Woody 's age , with some of Woody 's bluster but none of his good looks . Koerner looked like he 'd spent a good part of his life boxing : His nose had recorded at least a half-dozen breakings , and his brows were thick and gray . Like Woody , Koerner had spent his war years in the Pacific  --  we learned this at an orientation meeting in early June , when Woody introduced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the way a hell of a machine gunner in the Big Two . He enjoyed his occasional trips to the field nearly as much as Woody did , and they often toured the front line together . Koerner 's ostensible mission was to supervise our safety precautions , but I do n't remember his giving any instruction , showing us any techniques , or even correcting us as we chain-sawed without hard-hats and filed our axes in the direction of the blade . Instead , he described in gruesome detail accidents he 'd witnessed : In his stories , limbs intercepted by poorly managed chainsaws were always too shredded to reattach , and heads impacted by rotor blades always exploded like melons . He also gave us practical advice concerning ways to sidestep increasingly annoying post-Earth Day guidelines and rules . Koerner had only recently been transferred from a more public position directing firefighting operations in Utah , and I remember his telling us the best way to attack a fire in a wilderness area : You send in the dozers , build the roads you need , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , that 's a wilderness area ? " <p> One night during the summer we surveyed the Kaiparowits Plateau , after a bad steak dinner in Glen Canyon City 's only restaurant  --  an overpriced and underfurnished greasy spoon run by a polygamist whose ambition was to transform this bleak trailer-park outpost into the New Jerusalem  --  Woody and Roy did a tag-team explication of the War in the Pacific . As they poured scotch into their water glasses from a bottle hidden on the seat between them , Woody related the usual stories of his years in the Tonga Islands , stories that made Michener seem a stolid realist , and I remember Koerner telling us about his first postwar job as a guard at Alcatraz , perhaps the only career move that would allow him to return to civilian life yet still wield a machine gun on a fortified island . <p> But Woody kept bringing us back to the War in the Pacific , chronicling Koerner 's successes as a machine gunner on islands not far from Tonga . Koerner would smile his thin , level smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally , provide technical details about the difference between the BAR and heavier , water-cooled machine guns , but he left the body count to Woody . Koerner " fought his way across the Pacific Ocean , " Woody said , flicking cigar ashes into the dim ether of the bar as we considered this oddly biblical image , part Jesus Christ and part Horseman of the Apocalypse . Woody told us that Roy had stormed every important beach , was in the first wave every time . " He 's probably killed more people than you 're likely to meet in your entire life , " Woody said dramatically . " We 'll never know how many  --  is n't that right , Roy ?  --  because he had more important things to do than keep track , but you fire that many bullets into that many jungles , into that many Japs  --  well , they add up . " <p> Woody struggled to communicate to us just how many people the BLM 's Safety Officer had killed . Koerner , not embarrassed by all this attention but wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iwo he 'd led a crew of four , fired a machine gun that required men to feed the ammo belts and tend to the other complexities of the weapon , and that his crew had helped carry all the equipment to where it was needed . There was nothing modest or ironic in this , just a slow , careful specification of the facts as he remembered them ; he talked with the same measured clarity Craig Sylvester employed in explaining the solution to a problem of surveying . <p> " Yes , but you aimed the weapon , " Woody said quickly , " you lined up the cross hairs ... and the numbers ! " Woody waved his cigar around the room , taking in the Formica tables , the smudged mirror behind the bar , the dark corners . " You could fill this room with the men Koerner killed , " he said , finally thinking ( as a good surveyor ) spatially instead of merely numerically , translating figures into acreage , establishing the boundaries of the death and devastation he was trying to map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth allowed , Woody repeated : " You could fill this room with Koerner 's corpses , floor to ceiling , and there 'd be overflow out the door . " For a moment I could see all of them . <p> I grew up surrounded by images of World War II , absorbing the textures and colors through the focused reminiscences of the adults who presided over my childhood , the black-and-white movies that lit the afternoon channels with framed vignettes of romance and death , and later by way of constant comparisons to Vietnam , the routine and finally irrelevant contrasting of a good war with a bad one . Most of these images were relatively clear and unambiguous  --  Pearl Harbor , D-Day , and even the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima still come to me with precise clarity  --  but I had a hard time reconciling others . I had difficulty balancing the nostalgia with the horror , stories of romantic interludes with sexy French girls and stories of empty sleeves shortened with neat folds and a safety pin , the memories of heroic deeds and the continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , reconciling the two tales I 'd hear when the Deputy U.S. Surveyor and the BLM 's Safety Officer visited us in the field , the two different faces of war  --  Woody 's soft as a baby 's , lucid blue eyes floating wide open above his white wisps of mustache and the pale haze of his cigar smoke ; Koerner 's craggy , broken face , sunburned and chain-smoked dry , lined and flinty-eyed , with a thin , straight grin that remained disconcertingly cruel  --  as part of the same South Pacific story . <p> I was reminded of this problem one afternoon a few years ago ( a decade after I 'd given up surveying for good ) , during my first term teaching a course that focused on the literature of nature and wilderness . To get a discussion going , I 'd shown paired slides of contrasting landscapes : Thomas Cole 's luminous Oxbow and William Jackson 's stark Tetons , the rounded granite of Yosemite and the checkerboard regularity of Iowa . To these I 'd added a juxtaposition from my own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campsite in the Sierras , and one I 'd taken years earlier of a survey line I 'd helped cut on the Kaiparowits Plateau  --  a corridor of devastation we 'd chainsawed across a tableland of thick junipers and pinon pines , a narrow , straight clear-cut that I 'm sure will be recognizable a half-century from now . I explained that I 'd been a government surveyor , and that this employment had given me another interesting perspective ( I had become by this time fluent in the distancing syntax of academia ) from which to view the relationship between humans and the natural world we 'd been investigating . <p> After class a quiet man about my age , a student who had said very little through the semester , waited to see me . A short , thin man , he 'd made it clear in the few words he 'd spoken during discussions that he was not a literature major ; he was completing a degree in math , needed this class for a general-education requirement , and was working toward a teaching credential with which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the dependable order of numbers , the discipline that results from struggling to find the correct answer to a given problem . He was woefully out of place in my class , was resistant to even the most superficial or cynical approaches we 'd taken in considering all those nature/culture complications . <p> But now he was animated and smiling as he waited for the few remaining students to leave . He had finally found something in me besides an indefensible admiration for the romances of James Fenimore Cooper and a lot of fuzzy ideas involving art and philosophy . " I did n't know you 'd been a surveyor , " he said , as if I 'd been holding back the evidence of my credibility he had been searching for all semester , information that might have given him the permission he 'd needed to take the class seriously . <p> I told him a little about the work I 'd done for the BLM . He told me he 'd been a surveyor too , in Vietnam . It turned out he 'd used the same instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning its use from the same army manual I 'd been issued the summer we gave up our worn-out transits and embraced the brave new world of inverted images and one-second accuracy . <p> I could easily picture this man laying out airfields , camps , access roads , the kind of tasks private surveyors do , work lacking the historical context that , for better or worse , surrounded the surveying of America 's townships . Eager to define some contrasts  --  to put some distance between my experience and his , between me and this student that , frankly , I did n't like very much , a man whose humorless rigidity and complete lack of curiosity about cultures different from his own boded ill for his future pupils  --  I asked if since Vietnam he 'd done any surveying , running straight lines that extended themselves according to the points of the compass , subdividing the landscape into precise rectangles . <p> I thought I understood where this was going . I 'd been through this conversation a hundred times before , and had developed the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that of other surveyors . The surveyors most people see occupy construction sites , their transits set up amid the familiar clutter of highway construction or house-building , their crews attired in prissy fluorescent vests against the danger of passing automobiles . Government land surveyors  --  a breed both rarer and more difficult to observe from the road  --  regarded this kind of surveying as fussy and inconsequential , necessary in its mundane way but hardly in the same category as our work . To confine one 's breadth to the boundaries of a building lot or the width of a highway amounted to massive underachieving , selling short the entire profession . We believed these surveyors lacked ambition . <p> So when I told people about those summers , I immediately set out to correct their misconceptions . I was a land surveyor ; more important , I worked for the federal government , for the Bureau of Land Management , the descendant of the original General Land Office , the only bureau authorized to establish township boundaries . We measured our distances in miles , not feet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and links , terms enshrined in legislation that dated to the eighteenth century . If the person I was talking to seemed interested , and if I was feeling less guilty than usual about the ramifications of the work I had done , I 'd deliver the lecture I was giving to this suddenly comradely student , a speech that had picked up steam in the years I 'd been in graduate school and traded the vocational focus of the surveyor for the even more abstract and constricted focus of the scholar . <p> The speech went something like this : Our lines ran for miles , and they connected everything earthly in a neat web of intersections , lines that ran absolutely straight and at the same time , through the miracle of solid geometry , accommodated the curvature of the earth . We derived our bearings from observations of Polaris , and our distances were checked against those orderly lines of latitude and longitude that contain the planet  --  the north-south lines that run from pole to pole , the east-west lines that connect London with Tibet , Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polaris , from Washington , DC , to prime meridians in every state , from the mathematical truth discovered in the Enlightenment to the section corner we 'd mound with heavy rocks at the exact point where our lines met . We were n't laying out fences over which neighbors might chat about the weather . Our kind of surveying was ambitious , I said , trying to define something far beyond what the military would have required of this flat-stomached , closed-minded , and in all things limited man . <p> But as I spoke he 'd nodded enthusiastically , enjoying the discourse much more than most who made the mistake of asking me what I 'd done summers through the 1970s . " That 's exactly the surveying I did in Vietnam , " he said , smiling . He described details I was all too familiar with , surveying straight lines that ran north and south , east and west , clear-cutting vegetation to get unencumbered sight , laying out square-mile grids , marking intersections with permanent monuments , even shooting Polaris to check the accuracy of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia with the lines that grid the globe , to account in his equations for the rotation of the earth , the movement of our solar system within the Milky Way . <p> I was puzzled . I wondered about something so Jeffersonian in a place so far from America , the reasons for following the directives of the Land Ordinance of 1785 all the way to a war on the other side of the world . <p> " I was with the artillery , " he said . " We had to survey the place before we could shell it . " <p> " Oh , " I said , finally beginning to understand . <p> <p> By John Hales <p>
