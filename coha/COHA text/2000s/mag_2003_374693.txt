In Mexico , corn is king when it comes to tortillas . So what U.S. company would be loco enough to market white-flour tortillas to Mexicans  --  and price them at a premium ? <P> The H. E. Butt Grocery Co. , based in San Antonio , Texas , had no doubt that customers at its 20 stores in northern Mexico would gobble up the tortillas , because Hispanic customers at its 280 stores in Texas and Louisiana had already taken to their chewy texture and toasty flavor . That 's just one example of the cross-border synergy that 's helping H-E-B , as the chain is called , expand sales and profits in both countries . <P> Founded in 1905 in Kerrville , Texas , by the late Florence Butt , H-E-B , named for the initials of her son , is still family owned and today is run by Florence 's grandson , chairman and CEO Charles Butt , 65 . In a business increasingly dominated by huge national chains , H-E-B is a rare regional firm that has found a niche where it can beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , H-E-B is making a major push into Houston  --  with 50 stores open and seven more to come this year  --  and into Mexico , where it plans to double the number of stores within five years and open a 300,000-sq. - ft. warehouse in 2004 . Charles Butt says 2002 companywide sales were $9.8 billion , up from $8.9 billion in 2001 ; sales in Mexico were $571 million in 2002 , up from $429 million . ( The company does n't disclose profits , but H-E-B is thought to run profit margins close to the industry average of 1.4% . ) <P> What most sets H-E-B apart is its canny customization of stores . At the H-E-B in Houston 's Alief section , live tilapia and catfish swim in a tank in the seafood department , and fresh lemongrass and rambutan are stacked in the produce aisle  --  all favorites of Alief 's large Asian community . In San Antonio 's Deco-District there are fresh-baked pan dulce and nopalitos , an edible part of a cactus plant , for the area 's many Hispanic shoppers . And in Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ajwain and black mustard seeds . <P> The ideas flow from as well as to the Mexican operation . That 's how agujas de Nortena , an extremely thin cut of chuck steak popular in Mexico but rarely sold north of the border , found its way to H-E-B meat counters in the U.S.  --  By David Lincoln Ross
