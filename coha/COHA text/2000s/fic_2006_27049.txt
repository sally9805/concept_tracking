Near-Extinct Birds of the Central Cordillera I extended to the comandante the opportunity to walk the floor of the exchange with me , and he seemed reasonably intrigued .  - -  Richard Grasso , Chairman New York Stock Exchange Bogot , Colombia , June 26 , 1999 No way Blair insisted to anyone who asked , no self-respecting bunch of extortionist rebels would ever want to kidnap him . He was the poorest of the poor , poorer even than the hardscrabble campesinos pounding the mountains into dead slag heaps -- John Blair , graduate assistant slave and aspiring Ph.D. , whose idea of big money was a twenty-dollar bill . In case of trouble he had letters of introduction from Duke University , the von Humboldt Institute , and the Instituto Geogrfica in Bogot , whose director was known to have contacts in the Movimiento Unido de Revolucionarios de Colombia , the MURC , which controlled unconscionable swaths of the southwest cordilleras . For three weeks Blair would hike through the remnant cloud forest , then go back to Duke and scratch together enough grants to spend the following year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of habitat fragmentation on rarelocal species of parrotlets . It could be done ; it would be done ; it had to be done . Even before he 'd first published in a peer-reviewed journal -- at age seventeen , in Auk , " Field Notes on the Breeding and Diet of the Tovi Parakeet "  - -  Blair had known his was likely the last generation that would witness scores of these species in the wild , which fueled a core urgency in his boyhood passion -- obsession , his bewildered parents would have said -- for anything avian . Full speed ahead , and damn the politics ; as it happened they grabbed him near Popayn , a brutally efficient bunch in jungle fatigues who rousted all the livestock and people off the bus . Blair hunched over , trying to blend in with the compact Indians , but a tall skinny gringo with a big backpack might as well have had a turban on his head . " You , " said the comandante in a cool voice , " you 're coming with us . " Blair started to explain that he was a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his formidable language skills to walk him through this very sort of situation -- but one of the rebels was into his backpack now , spilling the notebooks and Zeiss-Jena binoculars into the road , then the Leica with the cannon-barrel 200x zoom . Blair 's most valuable possessions , worth more than his car . " He 's a spy , " announced the rebel . " No , no , " Blair politely corrected . " Soy ornitlogo . Estudiante . " " You 're a spy , " declared the comandante , poking Blair 's notebooks with the tip of his gun . " In the name of the Secretariat I 'm arresting you . " When Blair protested they hit him fairly hard in the stomach , and that was the moment he knew that his life had changed . They called him la merca , the merchandise , and for the next four days he slogged through the mountains eating cold arepas and sardines and taking endless taunts about firing squads , although he did , thanks to an eighty-mile-a-week running habit , hold up better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bringing in . The first day he simply put down his head and marched , enduring the hardship only because he had to , but as the column moved deeper into the mountains a sense of possibility began to assert itself , a signal too faint to call an idea . To the east the cordillera was scorched and spent , rubbled by decades of desperate agriculture . The few mingy scraps of surviving forest were eerily silent , but once they crossed the borders of the MURC-controlled zone the vegetation closed around them with the density of a cave . At night Blair registered a deep suck and gurgle , the engine of the forest 's vast plumbing system ; mornings they woke to the screams of piha birds , then the mixed-species flocks started in with their contrapuntal yammerings and groks and crees that made the forest sound like a construction site . In three days on the trail Blair reliably saw fourteen species on the CITES endangered list , as well as an exceedingly rare Hapalopsittaca perched in a fern the size of a minivan . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comandante , who eyed him for a moment in a thoughtful way . " Yes , " the rebel answered , " ecology is important to the Revolution . As a scholar "  - -  he gave a faint , possibly ironic smile --  " you can appreciate this , " and he made a little speech about the environment , how the firmeza revolucionario had banned the multinational logging and mining " mafias " from all liberated zones . The column reached base camp on the fourth day , trudging into the fortified MURC compound through a soiling rain . They hauled Blair straight to the Office of Complaints and Claims , where he sat for two hours in a damp hallway staring at posters of Lenin and Che , wondering if the rebels planned to shoot him today . When at last they led him into the main office , Comandante Alberto 's first words were : " You do n't look like a spy . " A number of Blair 's possessions lay on the desk : binoculars , camera , maps and compass , the notebooks with their microscopic Blairian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , while Alberto , the comandante mximo , studied Blair with the calm of someone blowing smoke rings . He resembled a late-period Jerry Garcia in fatigues , a heavy man with steel-rim glasses , double bags under his eyes , and a dense brillo bush of graying hair . " I 'm not a spy , " Blair answered in his wired , earnest way . " I 'm an ornithologist . I study birds . " " However , " Alberto continued , " if they wanted to send a spy , they would n't send somebody who looked like a spy . So the fact that you do n't look like a spy makes me think you 're a spy . " Blair considered . " And what if I did look like a spy ? " " Then I 'd think you were a spy . " The subcomandantes hawed like drunks rolling around in the mud . So was it all a big joke , Blair wanted . . . Continues ...              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
