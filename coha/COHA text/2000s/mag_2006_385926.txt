Cleaned Out My dashboard Check Engine light came on and a scan tool said Code P0171 was stored on my car 's computer . I checked the O2 sensor , mass airflow sensor ( MAF ) , etc . All voltage and resistances were well within the factory specs . So , I took the car to the dealer , and they replaced the MAF sensor . Since then , the car has been running fine and the light stays off . Why ? Is there any secret ? Mass airflow sensors constantly measure the amount of air entering the intake manifold . This lets the engine management computer know how much gasoline to inject into the cylinders for proper combustion . hot-wire-type sensors , like you have , work by keeping a short piece of wire or film at a constant , elevated temperature . An electrical current is applied to the wire to maintain its temperature ; the amount of current necessary to maintain the temperature is proportional to the mass of cool air flowing past it . Sounds complicated , but there are no moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , so good . Eventually , dirt and oily film bake onto the wire , insulating it from the cooler air-and when the engine management computer sees a value for air mass that 's too far out of range , it sets an error code . Periodically , there 's a cleaning cycle during which the wire is heated to a very high temperature right after engine shutdown . This burns off deposits . When this cleaning cycle fails to remove all of the contaminants , you 're supposed to replace the MAF sensor . According to almost every manufacturer , it 's not recommended or even possible to clean the delicate wires . Of course , they 're selling those sensors , so their motivation might be suspect . Next time , I 'd try cleaning it first-what do you have to lose ? I used to use aerosol carb cleaner , but CRC MAF Sensor Cleaner is new and less prone to dissolving other components in the MAF sensor . Do yourself a favor and remove the MAF sensor from the vehicle before attempting to clean it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , air filter and all associated ducting are intact , clean inside and not leaking dirt . This will keep you from needing to clean or replace the MAF sensor anytime soon . Power Surge Can welding on a vehicle damage its electronics ? I have heard that I should disconnect the battery , computer , alternator and other electrical components before welding . This was the policy of a company I used to work for that made and mounted truck bodies . But many companies , including the one I work for now , never disconnect anything . After all , ships and steel-frame buildings with grounded frame systems do n't require it . I have done structural work , such as extending truck frames and welding on tractors and on farm machinery connected to tractors , with no ill effects . The sensors for your car 's engine management computer can operate at millivolt voltages and at milliamp currents . A MIG or stick welder can reach 50 volts and hundreds of amps . Most of the time , the computer harness is insulated enough to prevent damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fry the electronics . If I need to weld on a car , I remove the computer and disconnect the battery ground cable to isolate the car 's electrical system . Free As Air I have a 1994 Lincoln Town Car with 161,000 miles . After parking the car I hear air venting from the air suspension system . After I restart the car , the air pump will run for 30 to 60 seconds . This started about three months ago . Is there an adjustment or an easy fix to correct this problem ? The compressor runs after you start the car because the air springs lose pressure and sag . They are just rubber bags , and there is a fair amount of plastic tubing hooking them to the pump . When you restart the car , the ride-height sensor sees the suspension is too low , and the pump runs until it comes back up to the required height . The leak continues while you 're driving , but you probably do n't notice the pump running while the car is running . There might be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just a leak . If you 're lucky , it 's a hose damaged by road debris or a loose fitting , which is easy to fix . A leaky air bag will cost a lot more to replace . Setting Limits I inadvertently redlined the engine on my 4.0-liter six-cylinder 2005 Nissan Frontier for a very short time . Would this have caused engine damage ? What would it take to ruin an engine ? I have 7800 miles on it . I usually am very careful and do n't drive aggressively . The engine management computer on all current production engines incorporates a rev limiter function to prevent engine damage . If the engine was warmed up and the incident did n't last long ( i.e. , a few seconds ) , there should be no damage . Older engines , ones with carburetors , typically have no such protection . Their upper engine speed is usually limited by valve float , which is when the valve springs can no longer close the valves fast enough . This can result in near-instantaneous damage , as the stillopen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your engine is probably fine . Just do n't make a habit of holding the throttle wide-open in Neutral . Oil Crisis I was changing my oil and put in a bottle of oil treatment-but I forgot to pour in any oil . I drove about a mile before the truck stopped when the engine seized . I 've put in some tranny fluid and have been cranking the harmonic balancer clockwise . It now has loosened about halfway , but the other half is still stiff . Would you please give me some advice on anything else that may work ? I saw on your Web site something about warm brake fluid . First off , I have never recommended putting brake fluid into the crankcase of a motor vehicle . As for your truck : You will never get it to run again by pouring solvents into the engine . I 've used Marvel Mystery oil or even ATF to try to free up an engine that had seized from being improperly stored . This is to help break up the corrosion ( rust ) between the rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long or well after this abuse . But , you ran the engine without any oil . What 's keeping it from turning over is the connecting rod shells that have welded themselves to the crank journals . If you 're able to turn it with a wrench , it 's because the rod shells are spinning in the big end of the rods . The crankshaft will have to be reground to a standard undersize-after it 's Magnafluxed to look for cracks . I 'm betting the pistons are scuffed , as well . You 'll probably need to bore the cylinders to a standard oversize and use new pistons . And I wo n't even go into the damage in the cylinder head to the valves , valve guides , or the camshaft and lifters . My suggestion : Find a friend with a boat and give him your engine to use as an anchor . Then buy a used engine at a junkyard . ON THE WEB More Car Care on the Web : **28;4782;TOOLONG .
