Chapter One Ten o'clock , a Wednesday morning in the beginning of July . John Holiday extended one arm over the back of the couch at his lawyer 's Sutter Street office . Today he was comfortably dressed in stonewashed blue jeans , hiking boots , and a white , high-collared shirt so heavily starched that it had creaked when he lowered himself into his slouch . His other hand had come to rest on an oversize silver-and-turquoise belt buckle . His long legs stretched out all the way to the floor , his ankles crossed . Nothing about his posture much suggested his possession of a backbone . Women had liked him since he 'd outgrown his acne . His deep-set eyes seemed the window to a poet 's soul , with the stained glass of that window the odd whitish blue of glacier water . Now , close up , those eyes revealed subtle traces of dissolution and loss . There was complexity here , even mystery . With an easy style and pale features-his jaw had the clean definition of a blade-he 'd been making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it for granted . He did n't much understand it . To him , the prettiness of his face had finally put him off enough that he 'd grown a mustache . Full , drooping , and yellow as corn silk , it was two or three shades lighter than the hair on his head and had only made him more handsome . Whenhis face was at rest , Holiday still did n't look thirty , but when he laughed , the lines added a decade , got him up to where he belonged . He still enjoyed a good laugh , though he smiled less than he used to . He was smiling now , though , at his lawyer , Dismas Hardy , over by the sink throwing water on his face for the third time in ten minutes . " As though that 's gon na help . " Holiday 's voice carried traces of his father 's Tennessee accent and the edges of it caressed like a soft Southern breeze . " It would help if I could dry off . " " Did n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the paper towels and now stood facing his cupboards in his business suit , his face dripping over the sink . Holiday shrugged himself up from the couch , dug in the wastebasket by the desk , and came up with a handful of used paper , which he handed over . " Never let it be said I ca n't be helpful . " " It would never cross my mind . " Hardy dried his face . " So where were we ? " " You 're due in court in forty-five minutes and you 're so hung-over you do n't remember where we were ? If you 'd behaved this way when you were my lawyer , I 'd have fired you . " Hardy fell into one of his chairs . " I could n't have behaved this way when I was your lawyer because I did n't know you well enough yet to go out drinking with you . Thank God . " " You 're just out of practice . It 's like riding a horse . You 've got to get right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that last night . Twice . " " Do n't look at me . If memory serves , nobody held a gun to your head . Why do n't you call and tell them you 're sick ? Get a what-do-you-call-it ... " " Continuance . " Hardy shook his head . " Ca n't . This is a big case . " " All the more reason if you ca n't think . But you said it was just dope and some hooker . " " But with elements , " Hardy said . In fact , he had n't done a hooker case for nearly a decade . In his days as an assistant DA , the occasional prostitution case would cross his desk . Hardy mostly found these morally questionable , politically suspect , and in any case a waste of taxpayer money . Prostitutes , he thought , while rarely saintlike , were mostly victims themselves , so as a prosecutor , he would often try to use the girls ' arrests as some kind of leverage to go after their dope connections or pimps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been in private practice , because there was little money in defending working girls , he never saw these cases anymore . As a matter of course , the court appointed the public defender 's office or private counsel if that office had a conflict . In this way , Aretha LaBonte 's case had been assigned to Gina Roake , a mid-forties career defense attorney . But Gina 's caseload had suddenly grown so large it was compromising her ability to handle it effectively . If she wanted to do well by the rest , she had to dump some clients , including Aretha . By chance she mentioned the case to her boyfriend , Hardy 's landlord , David Freeman , who 'd had a good listen and smelled money . With his ear always to the ground , Freeman had run across some similar cases . Aretha 's arrest had been months ago now . Her case was interesting and from Freeman 's perspective potentially lucrative because her arresting officer was n't a regular San Francisco policeman . Instead , he had been working for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to businesses under a jurisdictional anomaly in San Francisco . In its vigilante heyday a century ago , the city found that its police department could n't adequately protect the people who did business within its limits . Those folks asked the PD for more patrols , but there was neither budget nor personnel to accommodate them . So the city came up with a unique solution-it created and sold patrol " beats " to individuals who became private security guards for those beats . These beat holders , or Patrol Specials , then and now , were appointed by the police commissioner , trained and licensed by the city . The beat holders could , and did , hire assistants to help them patrol , and in time most Patrol Specials came to control their own autonomous armed force in the middle of the city . On his beat , a Patrol Special tended to be a law unto himself , subject only to the haphazard and indifferent supervision of the San Francisco Police Department . They and their assistants wore uniforms and badges almost exactly like those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other citizen , could make arrests . Aretha LaBonte 's arrest had occurred within the twelve-square-block area just south of Union Square known as Beat Thirty-two , or simply Thirty-two . It was one of six beats in the city owned by WGP , the corporate identity of a philanthropic businessman named Wade Panos . He had a total of perhaps ninety assistants on his payroll , and this , along with the amount of physical territory he patrolled , made him a powerful presence in the city . Aretha 's case was not the first misconduct that Freeman had run across in Panos 's beats . In fact , Freeman 's preliminary and cursory legwork , his " sniff test , " revealed widespread allegations of assistant patrol specials ' use of excessive force , planting of incriminating evidence , general bullying . If Hardy could get Aretha off on this one assistant patrol special 's misconduct , and several of the other " sniff test " cases could be developed and drafted into legal causes of action , he and Freeman could put together a zillion dollar lawsuit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a named defendant for allowing these abuses to continue . But at the moment , Hardy did n't exactly feel primed for the good fight . He brought his hand up and squeezed his temples , then exhaled slowly and completely . " It 's not just a hooker case . It 's going to get bigger , and delay does n't help us . There 's potentially huge money down the line , but first I 've got to rip this witness a new one . If he goes down , we move forward . That 's the plan . " " Which gang aft agley , especially if your brain 's mush . " " It 'll firm up . Pain concentrates the mind wonderfully . And I really want this guy . " " What guy ? " " The prosecution 's chief witness . The arresting cop . Nick Sephia . " Suddenly Holiday sat upright . " Nick the Prick ? " " Sounds right . " " What 'd he do wrong this time ? " " Planted dope on my girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him or paying for protection , so he set her up . " " You 've heard the song before ? " " It 's an oldie but goodie , Diz . Everybody knows it . " " Who 's everybody ? " A shrug . " The neighborhood . Everybody . " Suddenly Hardy was all business . He knew that Holiday owned a bar , the Ark , smack in the middle of Thirty-two . Knew it , hell , he 'd closed the place the night before . But somehow he 'd never considered Holiday as any kind of real source for potential complainants in the Panos matter . Now , suddenly , he did . " You got names , John ? People who might talk to me ? I 've talked to a lot of folks in the neighborhood in the last couple of months . People might be unhappy , but nobody 's saying anything too specific . " A little snort . " Pussies . They 're scared . " " Scared of Wade Panos ? " Holiday pulled at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , who else ? " " That 's what I 'm asking you . " Hardy hesitated . " Look , John , this is what Freeman and I have been looking for . We need witnesses who 'll say that things like this Sephia bust I 'm doing today are part of a pattern that the city 's known about and been tolerating for years . If you know some names , I 'd love to hear them . " Holiday nodded thoughtfully . " I could get some , maybe a lot , " he said . " They 're out there , I 'll tell you that . " His eyes narrowed . " You know Nick 's his nephew , do n't you ? Wade 's . " " Panos 's ? So his own uncle fired him ? " " Moved him out of harm 's way is more like it . Now he 's working for the Diamond Center . " " And you 're keeping tabs on him ? " " We 've been known to sit at a table together . Poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you is illegal . You beat him ? " A shrug . " I do n't play to lose . " The Wednesday night game had been going on for years now in the back room of Sam Silverman 's pawnshop on O'Farrell , a block from Union Square . There were maybe twenty regulars . You reserved your chair by noon Tuesday and Silverman held it to six players on any one night . Nobody pretended that it was casual entertainment among friends . Table stakes makes easy enemies , especially when the buy-in is a thousand dollars . Twenty white chips at ten bucks each , fifteen reds at twenty , and ten blues at fifty made four or five small piles that could go away in a hurry . Sometimes in one hand . With his neat bourbon in a heavy bar glass , John Holiday sat in the first chair , to Silverman 's left , and two chairs beyond him Nick Sephia now smoldered . He 'd come in late an hour ago and had taken a seat between his regular companions , Wade 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Julio Rez . The other two players at the table tonight were Fred Waring , a mid-forties black stockbroker , and Mel Fischer , who used to own four Nosh Shop locations around downtown , but was now retired . At thirty or so , Sephia was the youngest player there . He was also , by far , the biggest-six-three , maybe 220 , all of it muscle . While Silverman took the young Greek 's money and counted out his chips , Sephia carefully hung the coat of his exquisitely tailored light green suit over the back of his chair . The blood was up in his face , the color in his cheeks raw beef , the scowl a fixture . He 'd shaved that morning but his jawline was already blue with shadow . After he sat , he snugged his gold silk tie up under his Adam 's apple , rage flowing off him in an aura . The usual banter dried up . After a few hands during which no one said a word , Roy Panos pushed a cigar over in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silverman , maybe hoping to ease the tension , called a bathroom break for himself , and Sephia lit up , blowing the smoke out through his nose . Waring and Fischer stood to stretch and pour themselves drinks . Holiday , quietly enjoying Sephia 's pain , had a good idea of what was bothering him . Maybe the whiskey was affecting his judgment-it often did-but he could n't resist . " Bad day , Nick ? " Sephia took a minute deciding whether he was going to talk about it . Finally , he shook his head in disgust . " Fucking lawyers . I spent half the day in court . " " Why ? What 'd you do ? " " What 'd I do ? " He blew smoke angrily . " I did n't do dick . " Roy Panos helped him with the explanation . " They suppressed his evidence on some hooker he brought in for dope a couple of months ago . Said he planted it on her . " " So ? " Holiday was all sweet reason . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sephia 's dark eyes went to slits , his temper ready to flare at any indication that Holiday was having fun at his expense , but he saw no sign of it . " Guy made me look like a fucking liar , is the problem . Like I 'm supposed to remember exactly what I did with this one whore ? She 's got junk in her purse ; another one 's got it in her handbag . Who gives a shit where it was ? Or how it got there ? It 's there , she 's guilty , end of story . Am I right ? " " Fuckin ' A. " Julio Rez , a medium-built Latino , spoke without any accent . All wires and nerves , he 'd probably been a good base stealer in his youth . He 'd lost the lower half of his left ear somewhere , but it did n't bother him enough to try to cover it with his hair , which was cropped short . " She goes down . " " But not today . Today they let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They suppress the dope , there 's no case . " " Were you down at court , too ? " Panos shook his head . " No , but Wade was . My brother ? He is pissed off . " " Not at me , I hope , " Sephia said . Panos patted him on the arm . " No , no . The lawyers . Bastards . " " Why would your brother be mad at Nick ? " Holiday sipped again at his tumbler of bourbon . " He was working for him at the time , that 's why . It makes Wade look bad . I mean , Nick 's doing patrol for Christ sake . He busts a hooker , she ought to stay busted at least . Now maybe they start looking at the rest of the shop . " " Judge reamed my ass , " Sephia said . " This prick lawyer-he had the judge talking perjury , being snotty on the record . ' I find the arresting officer 's testimony not credible as to the circumstances surrounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can bite me . " Holiday feigned surprise . " Hardy 's my lawyer 's name . Dismas Hardy ? " Now Sephia 's glare was full on . " The fuck I know ? But whatever it is , I see him again , he 's going to wish I did n't . " " So he must have convinced them you did plant her ? " Rez shot a quick glance at Sephia . But Sephia held Holiday 's eyes for a long beat , as though he was figuring something out . " She was n't paying , " he finally said , his voice filled with a calm menace . " Wade wanted her out of the beat . Most of the time that 's intensive care . I figured I was doing the bitch a favor . " Dismas Hardy 's wife , Frannie , cocked her head in surprise . They 'd just sat down at a small Spanish place on Clement , not far from their house on Thirty-fourth Avenue . " You 're not having wine ? " she asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Just water . Water 's good . " " You feel all right ? " " Fine . Sometimes I do n't feel like drinking , that 's all . " " Oh , that 's right . I remember there was that time right after Vincent was born . " Their son , Vincent , was now thirteen . Continues ...
