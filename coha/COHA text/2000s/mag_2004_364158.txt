Here is a tale of the academy that , if you follow its trails , will lead you to learned journals , dense footnotes and multivariate regression analysis . But stick with it . In 1996 Samuel P. Huntington of Harvard University published his enormously influential book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order . Buried deep in its pages was the claim that there is " some evidence " that " resistance to assimilation is stronger among Mexican migrants " than it was among other immigrants to the U.S. But Huntington offered no supporting data . <P> Well , he has now . In an article in Foreign Policy magazine , Huntington argues that the nature of Latin American  --  and especially Mexican  --  immigration to the U.S. distinguishes it from prior waves . " Many Mexican American immigrants , " Huntington claims , " simply do not appear to identify primarily with the United States . " Huntington says successful assimilation in the past is unlikely to be duplicated with today 's Latin immigrants . " This reality , " he writes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain a country with a single national language and a core Anglo-Protestant culture ? " <P> The article is an extract from Who Are We ? , a forthcoming book by Huntington that celebrates the importance of that Anglo-Protestant culture to American identity and attacks those who supposedly undermine it . The book is right to stress that the destiny of Mexican Americans is central to our future . But if you are going to claim that Mexican immigrants do n't want to be Americans , your argument had better be watertight . Despite many statistics , Huntington does n't make his case .
