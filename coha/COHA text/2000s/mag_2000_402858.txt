Section : Militirize Space NOW ! The challenge of space can not wait until everyone 's turf is protected or the balloon hits the fan in some future conflict . <p> Nine years ago , as Americans watched live coverage of Tomahawk cruise missiles changing lanes in downtown Baghdad and government-supplied video of smart bombs ringing bunker doorbells before exploding , it became obvious that a Revolution in Military Affairs ( RMA ) was underway . The obvious assessment of this RMA : Damn , we 're good . <p> And so we are . Whatever else might be said of the American defense establishment , our stuff is world-class-plus . Nobody does it better ... or even comes close . <p> And therein lies the problem . Three problems , actually . First , the same RMA that makes us uniquely powerful also makes us uniquely vulnerable . Second , both this vulnerability and the evolution of the RMA point to the need  --  the ineluctable need  --  for a strong new U.S. military presence in space . <p> The third problem : A lot of folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until the reasons why we must go there are made so clear that not even NOPE ( Naysayers Opposed to Practically Everything ) can miss it , only disaster awaits . <p> To take them in turn : <p> For the most part , the RMA  --  the RMA Phase I , actually  --  has been an Information Revolution . Fifty years ago , mathematician John von Neumann predicted that of the two military revolutions going on , the nuclear and the computational , the latter would prove the more significant . He called it right . Our warheads molder and rust ; our microprocessors grow ever more potent . We rely now on a military " system of systems " that , as retired Admiral Bill Owens puts it in his fine new book , Lifting the Fog of War , does exactly that . Targeting grows almost as precise as Tiger Woods 's short game . Information can flow " from sensor to shooter " in something approaching real time . High-level commanders and staffs now " see " their battlefields and beyond in ways that Napoleon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have imagined . Were Karl von Clausewitz alive today , he 'd be frantically updating Vom Kriege from his graveside PC . <p> All very fine , this system of systems . But it 's heavily and irrevocably dependent on military and  --  increasingly  --  civilian satellites for intelligence-gathering , communications , navigation . Destroy , incapacitate , or degrade the satellites and the military system of systems begins to totter . Perhaps it crashes . Not to mention how rough it would be on civilian cell phone addicts and those who love them . <p> America has , at the moment , no mortal enemies  --  in Pentagonese , " peer competitors . " Those who wish us ill know that they ca n't match our system of systems . So they wo n't try . They 'll concentrate instead on " asymmetric threats " and " niche capabilities , " including anti-satellite warfare . Some years ago , the U.S. Naval War College ran a rather disconcerting simulation . A country that looked a lot like China did quite a number on the U.S. Seventh Fleet . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trashed U.S. satellites faster than we could launch them . <p> Very niche . Very asymmetrical . And , real-world , very doable  --  if not today , then soon enough . Anti-satellite missiles . Kinetic kill vehicles . Space mines . And , of course , nonviolent " soft-kill " techniques : cyberattacks , jamming , deceptive telemetry , etc . <p> Clearly , it 's vital to defend American satellites . It would also be nice to be able to deny the use of space to other nations . The Army recently played a war game in which a certain " New Islamic Republic " used both Chinese and commercial satellites to depressing effect . And it might be useful to place systems in space that could directly affect terrestrial events , whether the space-based component of serious homeland missile defense or weapons that could participate in combat below . <p> The RMA is trending there . RMA Phase I was basically about information . RMA Phase II will be about exotic new systems : lasers and beam weapons ; nano-technologies and MEMS ( Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems ) ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How close are we to Phase II ? Hard to tell , given the classified nature of so many programs and the fact that all components of any system have to mesh before you 've got a real-world weapon . The conventional wisdom holds that it will take decades to develop and deploy such systems . Given that unclassified major defense programs now do take decades from concept to combat , it may indeed be a while . <p> That 's the conventional wisdom . The conventional speculation , however , is that , out there in the black-ops world , where things sometimes get done a lot faster , there 's a lot of stuff maybe sorta getting ready to get ready to go up . <p> During the 1980 presidential campaign , Jimmy Carter , in a desperate attempt to look tough on defense , revealed the existence of the Stealth fighter  --  a super-secret previously known only to God , the Pentagon , Area 51 , and the readership of Aviation Week and Space Technology . Were Mr. Gore to try something similar , he could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any event , the gear is out there . Or could be . If the United States fails to exploit space , offensively and defensively , over the next few decades , the failure may be more political and cultural than technological . <p> Opposition comes from many sources . Some object to the " militarization of space , " as though space has n't been militarized since the first ICBM passed through and since the first satellite went up . Others fear provoking an " arms race . " The logic here seems to be that since our most precious assets are totally undefended , defending them will increase their vulnerability . In truth , there is an arms race in space ; we 're just not racing . The Russians and Chinese have had serious anti-satellite programs for decades . So , perhaps , have other countries , such as India and Pakistan , combining indigenous R &D; with purchase of foreign components from states and private corporations . Israel has also been busy with lasers , missile defenses , and other adaptable items . <p> Still other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed in an era when ( hard to remember ) there was but a single Star Trek series on earth . There 's no law made by humankind that ca n't be altered for sufficiently good reason , starting perhaps with the good reason that the Soviet signatory of these and other relevant treaties no longer exists . <p> Yet perhaps the greatest opposition  --  no , call it hesitancy  --  to the full military exploitation of space comes from the organization that bears the greatest responsibility for such exploitation : the United States Air Force . <p> This might seem odd . After all , what more logical outfit to handle space ? But the Air Force suffers from a strange set of problems nowadays . They know it . They admit it . But they may not have the will , or the wherewithal , to do much about it . <p> The Air Force has always been a pilot-dominated culture . The white-scarf-and-goggles mentality dies hard , and missilery and satellite-driving have never been fast-track careers . Most of what the Air Force does in space supports the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the money crunch . If anything has gone into orbit of late , it 's the cost of maintaining the present tactical aircraft fleet . Funding the F-22 fighter ( replacing the F-15 ) and the Air Force portion of the Joint Strike Fighter ( replacing the F-16 ) will require more cash than most governments spend on everything . When something has to give , it 's usually space . <p> But the age of manned ( in PC terminology , " inhabited " ) air combat is over . We 've built our last heavy bomber , the B-2 ( the Air Force intends to fly B-52 's until they 're 70 years old ) . The Joint Strike Fighter may never get built . The future lies with remotely piloted and robotic vehicles , with MEMS , and in space . Culturally , this means that the Air Force as we know it does n't have much longer . In fifty years , perhaps less , person-in-the-cockpit combat will be as obsolete as the cavalry charge . <p> Think on it . The Army , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about boots on the ground . The Navy : Ships will still be big and gray and sail away . But the United States Air Force , at the very moment of its global supremacy , must morph into something very different ... and alien to its cultural essence . <p> They 're human . They do n't like it . Rhetorically , they have no objection to exploitation of space . In the 1990 's , the Air Force described itself as an air force becoming an air and space force " on an evolutionary path " to becoming a space and air force . Now they 're back to the old word , " aerospace . " Generals make fine speeches about the importance of space and establishing a new culture , beginning with basic officer training . A few more space jocks and geeks are pinning on stars . But in truth , space remains an afterthought , perhaps at best a **41;1251;TOOLONG affair . <p> Several years ago , this got the attention of Senator Bob Smith , New Hampshire Republican and ardent space booster . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force would n't or could n't get happy and busy about space power , perhaps another service  --  or an entirely new Space Service  --  could . <p> Sen. Smith 's passion led to the establishment , with strong bipartisan support , of the " Commission to Assess National Security Space Management and Organization . " This blue-ribbon panel is scheduled to report by January 15 , 2001 . A staffer in Smith 's office says that nobody expects any immediate radical action ; the goal is to get some good advice and do a bit of Beltway consciousness-raising . A defense insider familiar with the commission 's work adds : " Absolutely everything is on the table .... They want the deliberations to be free from being vetted publicly . " <p> Most probably , space issues would have to be settled as part of fundamental restructuring and revision of the National Security Act of 1947 and subsequent legislation . Given the inter-service animosity and rivalry such an effort would generate , it 's an " **25;1294;TOOLONG " scenario that most would love to avoid . <p> But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowls are protected , or the balloon hits the fan in some future conflict . And the Air Force is the logical repository of the nation 's space power ... provided it can apply its traditional genius , energy , and courage to the effort . In the first decade of its existence , the Air Force worked miracles that the American people have yet to appreciate fully . Between 1947 and 1957 , the service organized as a separate branch ; fought the Korean War ; transitioned from prop jobs to jets ; built the Strategic Air Command ; established a brilliant ICBM program ; and got damn good PR in Hollywood and elsewhere , because it had a proud story to tell . Would that it could undertake the space mission with equal fervor and adequate resources . <p> Toward that end , there should be a Space Corps established within the Air Force , with its own budget line item and with ample career opportunities . In time , this Space Corps might evolve into a separate Space Service within the Department of the Air Force , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its mission should be to function as the " cavalry of the High Frontier , " fighting in space and on earth when necessary , protecting and working closely with the civilian sector , and with scientific endeavors . <p> As to whether this Space Service should someday segue into Star Trek 's Star Fleet ... who knows ? For the moment , let 's just get this country the space power it needs . <p> As Jean-Luc Picard would say , " Make it so .
