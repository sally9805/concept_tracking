Vijay Singh swings the golf club like Iron Byron and is often thought to have about as much personality . Over the past two decades he has been the game 's international man of mystery , collecting victories on five continents but precious few supporters along the way . A slave to his Hoganesque practice habits , Singh arrived on the U.S. Tour in 1992 , and few of his colleagues knew what to make of this lone wolf . He preferred beating balls to making small talk , and his immediate success  --  he had six top 10 finishes and ended up at 19th on the money list that first year on the Tour  --  only made him that much more unapproachable. // Singh was long ago written off by reporters as the worst interview in the sport , and even the most respectful of golf fans have remained indifferent to him . On Sunday evening Singh , 37 , was strolling up the 18th fairway at Augusta National , having wrapped up his second major championship in 20 months , and the gallery lining the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and handsome stranger , grudging recognition of a sublime display of smashmouth golf . // But running parallel to Singh , cutting a swath through the crowd on the left side of the fairway , was a group making a noisy rebuttal to those who think Singh , a native of Fiji , is an island unto himself . A motley crew of more than a dozen friends and family members shadowed Singh up the 18th , and they were as jubilant as he was reserved . They shouted , " Vijay is for victory ! " over and over , hugged and kissed and pounded one another on the back and cried more than a little . The rooting section included Singh 's warm , chatty wife , Ardena , who has been with him since the mid-1980s , when he was a teaching pro in Borneo , where their water was drawn from a well and the nearest town was three hours away by dirt road ; their son , Qass , 9 , to whom Vijay is so attached that he insisted on bringing him along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niyomkul , married Atlanta restaurateurs by way of Bangkok whom Singh met in the early ' 90s . The Niyomkuls remain so devoted to their friend that they drove 2 ? hours each way to Augusta to deliver to Singh his favorite Thai dinners six nights in a row . Also in the middle of the back-slapping pack were Singh 's swing coach , Farid Guedra , a French-speaking Algerian whom Singh met in Nigeria in 1988 during a stop on the South African tour and who traveled from his home in Sweden to offer support ; and assorted friends and business associates from Florida and Ohio and who knows where else . This United Nations of backers helped inspire Singh to a three-stroke victory , the 27th and most important of his far-flung career , surpassing even his ' 98 PGA Championship . // " It 's an incredibly warm feeling , " Singh said late on Sunday night following the traditional champion 's dinner , where he broke bread with his family and friends in the Augusta clubhouse , surrounded by the club 's membership . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Acceptance has been an issue for Singh ever since a nebulous 1985 incident in Jakarta in which he was accused of altering his scorecard in order to make the cut at a tournament , an allegation he denies . At the mention of Singh 's name last week one American Ryder Cupper sniffed , " Once a cheater , always a cheater . Golf has a long memory . " // That a player long considered a loner and something of an outcast has such devoted friends was but one of the revelations to come out of this Masters . Another was that there is more to his game than peerless ball striking . Singh led the field in greens in regulation , as he often does , but more impressive was a series of recovery shots and clutch putts that trumped David Duval in a nerve-jangling showdown that lasted much of the final round . // Three times on the front nine Singh topped Duval birdies with birdies of his own , and a trio of spectacular up-and-downs  --  one to make a par on the 7th hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as a bogey save on 11 after plunking his approach in the pond  --  allowed him to take a one-stroke lead into the 13th , the short , do-or-die par-5 where so many Masters are lost and won . Singh tamed the hole with two merciless swings , leading to a two-putt birdie , while Duval drowned his second shot in Rae 's Creek , a miscue that is sure to dominate the movie screen of his imagination for innumerable nights to come . Duval 's bogey pushed Singh 's lead to three strokes , and it would never again dip below two . // Singh had more than just home cooking working for him at the 64th Masters . He was also helped by a course setup that dramatically altered the flavor of the Annual Augusta Spring Putting Contest , as Johnny Miller used to derisively call the tournament . The first cut of rough , introduced last year to much hand-wringing , had been expanded significantly to pinch the landing areas on some of Augusta National 's twisty fairways . Deeper , fluffier sand was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the local Waffle House . Augusta , always an expansive canvas for freewheeling artistic expression , was suddenly more like the kind of punitive setup typical of a U.S. Open ( THE LIFE OF REILLY , page 88 ) . Throw in a swirling wind on Thursday that gusted to 25 miles per hour , and only a pair of big-boned Yankee ball-strikers could break 70  --  Dennis Paulson , with a 68 , and Tom Lehman , at 69 . Singh hit an exceptional 16 of 18 greens and ground out a 72. // It was in Thursday afternoon 's breeze that Tiger Woods blew his chance for victory . He hung up a 75 , his worst score of the year by two strokes . Woods had stormed into Augusta having finished first or second in 10 of his previous 11 tournaments , a stretch of such sustained dominance that at last month 's Players Championship , Colin Montgomerie , third in the World Ranking , went on record saying he felt as if he were playing for second place in Woods 's presence . A sure sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by showing up came when he doinked a tree with his first shot of the tournament . He later double-bogeyed the 10th hole and then made a triple bogey at the par-3 12th , rinsing his tee shot in the creek and then , following a penalty drop , three-putting from 12 feet . It was Woods 's first triple in 541 holes . // The weather on Friday turned out to be far more benign , but Woods could n't take advantage of it , fighting his putter on the way to a lackluster 72 . ( He made the cut by only one stroke . ) Singh , meanwhile , buried four birdie putts of 10 feet or more , including a 35-foot bomb at the 9th , and shot a 67 to move to five under for the tournament . Singh 's struggles on the greens are legendary ; he claims to have a thousand putters at his home in Ponte Vedra Beach , Fla . ( " That 's not an exaggeration , either , " he says . ) His renaissance on the greens at Augusta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. Open in February , an ugly thing called a Dandy , as well as a new touchy-feely attitude . Singh grew up studying pictures of the swing of Tom Weiskopf , the brilliant shotmaker whose spotty putting doomed him to four runner-up finishes at Augusta , and he was determined not to go down that road . " I 've decided to try enjoying putting more than hating it , " said Singh , who says he 's an avid reader of self-help books . " If I have a bad attitude on the greens , I may as well not come here . " // Singh 's 67 left him two strokes shy of the midway leader , Duval , who on Friday fired the low round of the tournament , a bogey-less 65 . Duval came to Augusta with much to prove . Last year he rode into the Masters atop the World Ranking , having chalked up four victories in the previous three months , including the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic , which he won with an historic 59 . Duval was within one shot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumped a four-iron into the pond at 11 , the portal to Amen Corner , and he has n't been the same player since . He went winless over the rest of 1999 , sidetracked by controversies large and small . He showed up for this season with a new body and a new attitude  --  " Every regular Tour event to David is now just preparation for the majors , " says his sports psychologist , Bob Rotella . Still , no victories would come during the season 's first three months , and when he was asked recently about his rivalry with Woods , Duval said , " Not much of a rivalry these days , is it ? " // Duval had been so focused on the Masters , and on finally getting off the schneid , that when he arrived at the course in advance of the tournament , " it was like a load had been lifted , " he said . " I felt like , It 's time to relax and enjoy myself and go play . " His version of relaxing meant heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a couple of miles of running " just to warm up " and then a six-mile jog the day before the tournament began . // All of Duval 's maniacal training could n't prepare him for the hardships of Saturday , one of the most vexing weather days in the tournament 's history . The morning began overcast and eerily still , and Woods took full advantage . Going out at 10:10 ( an hour when he is usually just crawling out of bed and pouring himself a bowl of Cocoa Puffs ) , Woods strung together four birdies from the 7th hole through the 10th to get back to even par before his momentum was halted by heavy rains . After a two-hour delay play was resumed in a steady drizzle , and in the soft conditions he finished his 68 , tied for low round of the day , to move to one under for the tournament . Woods completed his round at around 4 p.m. , just as the leaders were teeing off , which also happened to coincide with the arrival of a cold front that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 ? with a windchill in the 40s , and brought gusts up to 42 mph . Unattended folding chairs skittered across the course like tumbleweeds , and enough bunker sand was sent airborne that it was like playing golf in the middle of The Grapes of Wrath . Jack Nicklaus , competing in his 41st Masters , said , " These are by far the toughest conditions I 've seen here . " // In these extreme elements Singh played his most heroic golf of the tournament , hitting 12 of 14 greens ( the round would be curtailed due to darkness ) , and birdieing the treacherous 12th hole , as well as three others , to move to seven under , three up on Duval , who played credibly but for a wind-plagued double bogey at 12 . Singh credited his outstanding shotmaking to " good solid strikes to the ball , " a technique he perfected growing up in Fiji , when during low tide he would hit balls on the flat , firm sand of the beach , excellent practice for the tight lies of Augusta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biting cold of Sunday morning , both Duval and Singh parred in , setting the stage for Sunday 's dramatics . Duval gave valiant chase , but his hopes ended at the 13th when he had only 197 yards to the pin but caught a five-iron heavy and blocked it into the creek . " It was just a bad golf shot , and it was the wrong time to do it , " a curt Duval said . " I really do n't know what else to say . " His final-round 70 left him in a tie for third place . ( Ernie Els , with a strong 68 on Sunday , sneaked into second . Woods never mounted a serious Sunday charge , shooting 69 to finish fifth. ) // On the 25th anniversary of Lee Elder 's shattering the race barrier at the Masters , Singh became the second man of color to win the tournament in the past four years . He , too , knows of racial prejudice , but it came not in the Jim Crow South but rather in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraction , a descendant of Hindus and Muslims from the subcontinent , subjected to the island 's state-sanctioned discrimination . ( Indians , for example , can not hold the office of president or prime minister . ) Singh is by far the biggest sports star the country has produced , but he has returned to Fiji no more than a handful of times since embarking on his professional career two decades ago . This estrangement from his homeland has helped cloud Singh 's image . He has been miscast as a golfing mercenary , with houses in Florida and London but no real home . // In Singh 's mind his victory at the PGA two years ago went a long way toward rehabbing his reputation . Perhaps with his joyous Masters victory Singh will finally feel comfortable introducing a kinder , gentler version of himself to the golfing public . Loren Roberts , who tied Duval for third , said after Sunday 's finale , " He 's a great champion , a deserving champion . I think a lot of people misunderstand Vijay . He 's not aloof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of b.s. , which I like . Above all , Vijay loves the game and respects the game , and that is evident in his dedication to improving and in the way he conducts himself . " // It was well after 11 o'clock on Sunday night when Singh finally left the Augusta National clubhouse , having indulged a series of TV interviewers and autograph seekers . He was slowly making his way to the players ' parking lot , carrying his golf bag on his left shoulder and holding his golf shoes in his right hand . Singh 's friends were waiting for him back at his hotel room to continue the celebration , and he was looking forward to joining them . These are the people who know him as an incorrigible prankster , who indulge his love of James Bond movies and of  --  brace yourself  --  Fleetwood Mac . These are the loved ones who cluck when they recount how Singh dotes on his six German shepherds . For the rest of us , this is the Singh we know : His back is turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
