In 1942 , Joseph Mitchell ( Tucci ) , a revered New Yorker writer , published an article about Joe Gould ( Ian Holm ) , a Greenwich Village Bohemian who claimed to be writing a history of the world millions of words long . Twenty-two years later , Mitchell admitted that Gould 's manuscript , except for a few fragments , did n't exist . Thereafter Mitchell could be heard typing in his office every day , but he never published another word . There 's a great story here , but Tucci 's literate , civilized , wistful movie lacks savage impulse and refuses to show how mutual exploitation led to minor tragedy . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
