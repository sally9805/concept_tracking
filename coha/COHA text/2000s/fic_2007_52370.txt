Last year , our serialization of Terry Bisson 's " Planet of Mystery " went over well , so we thought we 'd oblige readers with another two-part adventure . This one comes courtesy of Matthew Hughes , whose tales from the Penultimate Age of Old Earth have made him one of our most popular writers in recent years . " The Helper and His Hero " marks the culmination of the sequence of Guth Bandar stories he has been spinning ( all of which will be assembled into a novel and published in June as The Commons ) . Readers of Mr. Hughes 's novel Black Brillion will find many echoes of that story in this tale ... but actually , you need not have read any of the past stories to enjoy this one . You doubt ? Read on and see- <p> GUTH BANDAR WAS ADRIFT in a formless , limitless , gray nothing . Above him was nothing , ahead and to all sides was nothing , and below was nothing . But no , far down ( an arbitrary direction - it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something tiny that , as he watched , grew larger as it came toward him . Now Bandar felt a shiver of fear . For this no-place could be only one place . He was adrift in the Old Sea of preconsciousness , the inert and timeless realm that underlay the collective unconscious of humanity . Only one thing moved in the Old Sea : the great blind Worm that endlessly swam its " waters " in search of its own tail . And only one thing could divert the Worm from its eternal , futile quest . As early nonauts had discovered when they had hacked their way through the floor of the Commons and dipped into the pearl gray nothingness beneath , the Worm sensed any consciousness that entered the Old Sea-and inerrantly swam to devour it . It is a dream , of course , Bandar told himself . He applied the nonaut techniques that would allow him to take charge of the dream , to change its dynamic , or to wake from it . But nothing happened . He floated in nothingness , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . In moments it looked to be the length of his forearm , its undulating motion hypnotically compelling his gaze . Bandar looked away , sought to concentrate on the techniques of lucid dreaming , but when he looked again , the Worm was as long as his leg . Its great dark circle of a mouth , rimmed with triangular teeth , grew larger as he watched . A wave of panic swept through him . He flailed against the nothingness , as if he could swim away . But there was nothing to push against , nowhere to go even if he could somehow achieve motion . And still the Worm rose beneath him , its gaping maw now as wide as a housefront and still relentlessly enlarging . " What do you want ? " Bandar called into the void . There could be only one agent behind this : the Multifacet , the entity that was the collective unconscious paradoxically become conscious of itself , that for its own obscure ends had ruined Bandar 's career only to abandon him . Was it now back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had often feared , simply gone mad and tossed him into the Old Sea , for no other reason than that it had the awful power to do so ? The mouth of the Worm loomed beneath him now like a black moon , still rising . " Tell me what you want ! " Bandar screamed , while a part of his mind offered him the obvious answer : maybe it just wants you eaten . " I did everything you asked ! " he cried . " What do you want now ? " And as the Worm rose to swallow him a voice from the nothingness said , " More . " Bandar awoke in his comfortable seat in the well-appointed gondola of the midafternoon balloon-tram , the dream-fear fading along with all memory of the Worm . He discovered that , while he had been dozing , two late arrivals must have boarded just before the conveyance lifted off from the terminal in the heart of Olkney . One of the two would have drawn attention wherever he went , for he was quite possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was light enough on his feet as he made his way among the scattered armchairs in which passengers disposed themselves for the trip to Farflung , at the edge of the Swept , the great , unnaturally flat sea of grass that Bandar had always longed to travel . The fat one 's companion was a young man in nondescript garb wearing a slightly soiled cravat that identified him as a third-tier graduate of the Archon 's Institute for Instructive Improvement , where the great and the titled had sent their children from time immemorial ; its history faculty was tangentially connected to Bandar 's alma mater , the Institute for Historical Inquiry . But it was not the possibility of academic connection that gave the nodnaut a start ; rather , it was a fixity of expression and a fierceness about the eyes that gave Bandar the impression that the young man 's features might never have arranged themselves into the full complement of expressions that a normal human visage displays over a lifetime , even a short one . Bandar allowed this initial impression to linger in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from his unconscious . Moments later , a series of images floated onto his inner screen , and he was surprised to note that all of them were faces he had encountered in the Commons ; he realized that the stranger , who was now seating himself across the gondola 's wide aisle and engaging in low-voiced argument with the fat man , showed the same simplicity of character as that of an idiomatic entity . When the steward brought round a tray of wine and delicacies , the noonaut used the distraction to sneak another glance at the two men . He now saw a definite contrast between them . Across the plump one 's multi-chinned face a succession of micro-expressions chased each other : mild irritation , bemusement , curiosity , and the indulgence shown toward a child whose behavior straddles the narrow line between amusing and aggravating . But the young man 's face showed nothing but righteous anger , unalloyed by doubt or even self-consciousness , and with an intensity that Bandar found unnerving . Fortunately , whatever concerns motivated the strange young man were none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gondola 's wide window . The spires and terraces of Olkney were dropping below him as the balloon from which the gondola hung was allowed to rise to its cruising height . Soon he felt the slight tug of the umbilicus that connected the balloon to its dolly , now far below . The gondola rocked gently then settled as the operator engaged the system that brought the materials of which the dolly was formed into contact with the track into which it was slotted . A collaboration of energies moved the dolly forward , at first slowly , then with increasing speed , towing the tapered cylinder of the balloon and its underslung gondola in a smooth and silent passage . Bandar 's ambition to travel the Swept had long been frustrated . It was a vast , wild land , almost entirely unpopulated except for some brillion miners . The great flatness , with its shoulder-high grass , was prowled by dangerous wildlife : omnivorous garm , both the lesser and greater species ; sinewy fand , with needle teeth and ravenous appetite ; and the huge but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry whelps . The Swept had never been repopulated after its artificial creation eons before , during a desperate effort to repel the last aggressive invasion of Old Earth by a vicious predatory hive species known as the Dree . A gravitational aggregator , normally used to assemble asteroids into convenient conglomerations , was brought down to crush the invaders and their legions of hapless human mind-slaves in their warren of tunnels . But the immense gravitational waves had created resonances deep in the planet 's core , - even today cysts and bubbles of various sizes and intensities rose to the surface , though no one could predict where or when . A building that happened to be in the path of a rising anomaly could find the weight of its components drastically and suddenly reordered , leading to a collapse . Persons traveling on foot faced the same peril , and flying was advisable only in emergencies . There were two safe ways to travel the Swept . One was to take passage on a landship , a great-wheeled wind-driven vessel built with enough flexibility to withstand minor anomalies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landships catered to the truly affluent ; Bandar had never been able to afford a cruise lasting weeks and the landships did not offer day trips . The less costly option was to hire a Rover to take him out onto the Swept in a two-wheeled cart drawn by shuggra . The Rovers were a fabricated species , developed from canines during a past age when trifling with life 's elementary constituents was approved of . They lived as hunters and guides on the Swept , served by their innate ability to sense gravitational fluxions . That ability would have made the Rovers ideal for Bandar 's purposes - he wished to study the effects of gravity on the formulation of noospheric corpuscles , and the anomalies offered unique experimental conditions - but Rovers disliked gravitational fluctuations . They used their senses to avoid the phenomena Bandar sought . He had taken the balloon-tram to Farflung twice before , during rare vacations from the housewares emporium , and each time he had tried to engage Rover guides . For his second trip , he had even learned the odd , gobbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his request , any Rover he approached looked down and away and professed to know nothing of anomalies , or declared himself already engaged , or under some nebulous obligation that prevented him from accommodating Bandar . The balloon-tram was now passing the Institute for Historical Inquiry , and Bandar looked down upon the cloisters in which he had never again been allowed to set foot after the Institute 's dons judged him responsible for plunging Didrick Gabbris into permanent psychosis . That was now decades ago , and Bandar no longer let his powerful memory take him to that painful time . But the noonaut 's heart still harbored a desire to return to the Institute in triumph . He would present the Grand Colloquiam with irrefutable new facts . If that meant overturning dogmas grown dusty over millennia , then so be it . And now that he was able at last to travel the Swept , Bandar saw victory as a glimmering prospect . It bothered him only slightly that he had connived , and indeed had probably broken a statute or two , in order to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to persons suffering from the lassitude , the first new disease to strike the human population of Old Earth . Bandar did not have the lassitude ; indeed , he knew no one who did . Astonishing himself by his own boldness , he had invented an afflicted brother and offered forged documents to the organizers . A few days later , a pair of tickets had arrived . Bandar threw one away . The other was in an inner pocket of his traveling mantle . He turned back from the window to take another glass of wine from the steward and found that the fat man had fallen asleep in his chair while the young one was staring at Bandar with an almost palpable intensity . Again , the noonaut was startled , but it soon became apparent that the fellow hardly noticed him , that his stare was merely the outer sign of a deep introspection . Again , too , he was struck by the quality of otherness in the young man 's eyes : they would not have looked out of place in the skull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on Bandar . The nonaut made the gestures appropriate between travelers whose ranks were unknown to each other and said , " By your scarf , may I take you for a graduate of the Archon 's Institute ? " The young man fingered his neck cloth . " Yes , " he said . " May I ask if you studied history ? " " No . Criminology . " He had a brusque manner of speech , but Bandar sensed that it was not intended to offend . He began to speak his name , then seemed to catch himself before declaring himself one Phlevas Wasselthorpe , of the minor aristocracy . The man snoring beside him was his mentor , Erenti Abbas . Bandar introduced himself and said , " It would have been a convenient coincidence if you had studied history . I , myself , have spent most of my life dealing in housewares . I am now retired and taking a full-time interest in my longstanding avocation : the study of history , specifically the history of the Swept . " Bandar turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Dree invasion . Wasselthorpe , surprising for an Institute graduate , even third-tier , had never heard of it . He asked questions , and Bandar sketched the outline of events and mentioned his intent to study the gravitational residues . It was clear from the young man 's face that the Dree did not interest him . He abruptly turned to another issue for which the Swept was famous , asking what Bandar knew about brillion mining . Bandar knew what everyone knew : brillion was a catch-all name for substances formed in the depths of the Earth from waste products deposited by the dawn-time 's wastrel civilizations . Old Earth 's original inhabitants , scarcely out of the caves , had fashioned many materials , natural and artificial , to use but once , then throw away . This ancient detritus was dumped into depressions , plowed under , and capped by layers of earth . Most was eventually dug up to become fodder for mass-conversion systems ; however , some of the societies that had created these deposits being later destroyed or relocated , the whereabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shallow deposits were gradually buried beneath accumulated rock . Some were drawn even deeper into the planet by tectonic motions , and then the same forces that make diamond from coal worked upon the rich variety of substances that paleohumans had promiscuously mixed together . The result was brillion , and it came in several varieties : blue , red , and white were the main types , though they could be found in some interesting blends . Each had its properties and uses . And then there was the rarest of all : black brillion , a substance so rare and precious that those who found it never advertised the news . Or so it was said . It was also said the stuff could work wonders . Bandar reserved his opinion , though Wasselthorpe pressed for a definitive answer . Their voices awoke the fat man , Abbas . He joined the conversation and his contributions made it less an interrogation and more the kind of amiable chat engaged in by travelers with persons they were unlikely to encounter again . At some point , Bandar revealed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manner that implied both knowledge and interest , but his companion had never heard of the Commons and thus began a new interrogation . Bandar was always happy to talk about the nosphere . But as he did so now he saw the young man seize upon the subject with an intensity that Bandar found unsettling . He sought to redirect the conversation back to the Swept . " It has long been known that the existence of the Commons is in some way connected to gravity , " he said . " It is difficult to access in space , for example , and some have said that human experiences that have taken place beyond gravity wells do not register strongly and are lost to the common memory . " Abbas responded to the diversion , wondering if the gravitational anomalies might enhance Bandar 's abilities as a nonaut . It was a pertinent question and Bandar now noticed that attached to the lapel of his robe were the pin and pendant of a runner-up for the Fezzani Prize , a notable academic achievement . He responded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I am hopeful of conducting some remarkable research . Out of it may come the seed of a small institute . " " The Bandar Institute , " Abbas said , and the words voiced an idea Bandar had never put so bluntly . But now the other one was boring in with a question about how the Commons might figure in the field of criminal investigation . It struck Bandar that criminology was an odd pursuit for a member of the aristocracy , even a rustic . He did not want to go off on a monomaniac 's tangent and answered lightly , then followed with a brief dissertation on the formation and activities of engrammatic cells , corpuscles , and archetypical entities , knowing from experience that technical language would swiftly chase away casual interest . But Wasselthorpe 's eyes failed to glaze and he continued to regard Bandar with an unsettling intensity . " But where is this nosphere ? " he said . " Where do your engrams and archetypes do their work ? " Bandar tapped the back of the Wasselthorpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In all of us . " He saw comprehension dawn in the young man 's face , then puzzlement . Wasselthorpe said he thought the collective unconscious was mere myth . To Bandar , myth was never " mere . " Myth was always an expression of fundamental truth . He would have led the discussion along other paths but again the young fellow demonstrated his unnerving literal-mindedness . He quoted Bandar from a few moments ago , when the nonaut had told him that a traveler of the Commons needed a good memory and a knack for detail . He declared that he had both . Bandar decided it was time to ease this peculiar young man out of an apparent enthusiasm that might lead to obsession . To test Wasselthorpe 's memory , he said , " How many doors were in the waiting room at the balloon-tram station , in which walls were they set , and what was written on each ? " Wasselthorpe paused only a moment before saying , " Four doors , two in the west wall , one each in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised ablutories for males and females , the one in the north wall was for a closet holding supplies , and the southern door led to the station master 's office . " He added , " That door had a scratch in the paint above the handle . " Bandar was as impressed by the power of Wasselthorpe 's eidetic memory as he was concerned by the intensity with which he had answered the challenge . But it was a violation of his nonaut 's oath not to respond to a potential candidate for training . With some trepidation , he offered to test the young fellow 's aptitude . Wasselthorpe declared himself keen . Bandar threw a querying glance Abbas 's way , but receiving only the facial equivalent of a shrug , he explained the different mental images that a traveler might envision as the initial portal to the Commons . " I will see a door , " Wasselthorpe said , with complete certainty . Then he wanted to know what would be behind it . " Let us not skip before we can hop , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own voice the dry tone of Preceptor Huffley , who had said the same words to him , long years ago . The Commons was dangerous for anyone ; for some , it was indescribably perilous . The warning did nothing to blunt the young man 's interest . The gleam in the eyes that were now locked upon his made Bandar uncomfortable . The nonaut lowered his gaze to his hands as he briefly sketched the arrangement of the psyche . " For now , I think we should go no farther than up to the first door , " Bandar said . " If you can hold it in your mind 's eye for a few moments , that will show an aptitude . " Wasselthorpe was eager to make the attempt . Bandar bade the young man close his eyes and still his limbs , then instructed him on the regulation of his breathing . The noonaut was surprised that , within moments , Wasselthorpe appeared well settled . " Are you ready ? " he asked . " I am , " said Wasselthorpe , and Bandar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwillingness among any of the less obvious components of the fellow 's psyche . It was yet another unusual response from a complete beginner . " I will teach you the introductory thran , " he said . He sounded a sequence of tones and asked Wasselthorpe to copy him . The thran came back note-perfect and again Bandar heard no microquavers to indicate that some element of the young man 's psyche opposed what they were about to do . How rare , he thought . They continued to intone the thran for a few moments , then Bandar broke off to say , " When you see anything that might be a door , raise one finger . " He resumed the chant , expecting some time to go by before he saw a response . Instead , scarcely had he sounded the first few notes before Wasselthorpe was holding a digit almost beneath Bandar 's nose . The deep conviction in the young man 's chanting voice strengthened even further . It came to Bandar that he might be in the presence of a seriously unbalanced mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark of a natural . If so , to plunge his consciousness into the Commons would have immediate and disastrous results : he would be sharing the confined space of a balloon-tram gondola with a full-blown psychotic . Even as he followed his thought to its frightening conclusion , Bandar saw Wasselthorpe 's still elevated hand move forward , fingers curling as if to grasp . He not only sees the portal but reaches to open it , Bandar thought . He immediately ceased chanting and called in a peremptory voice : " Enough ! Come back ! " Wasselthorpe gave a start . The hand that had been reaching out now subsided to the arm of the young man 's chair . Bandar rose to stand over him and shook his shoulder . Abbas sat forward in his chair , concern on his many-chinned face . The young man 's eyes opened , blinking , and Bandar was relieved to see them fill with awareness . He let out a pent breath and said , " You were too fast ! I almost lost you . " Wasselthorpe seemed unfazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , " he said . " And my own hand was reaching to open it . " A shock went through Bandar . " You saw light and made a hand , though you had never heard of any of this before ? " Wasselthorpe said that he was not inclined to tease . Abbas vouched for the truth of the statement , describing his companion as " no bubbling fount of mirth . " Bandar passed a hand across his brow , felt cold moisture . He had never seen nor heard of such aptitude . Bandar had been talented , but it had taken weeks of instruction and practice before he could call up his own portal and discern the light beyond it , and weeks more before he could open the way for more than a twinkling . Wasselthorpe said it had seemed only natural , a term that caused Bandar to shudder . He explained its technical meaning among Institute scholars and found that his voice was trembling . He asked to be allowed a few moments to reflect upon what had happened . But Wasselthorpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mentor . " If my young charge is no more than a skip and a jump from a serious bout of the hoo-hahs , I would appreciate knowing the warning signs . " " He is in no danger if he does not call up the vision of the door . " Bandar looked sternly at Wasselthorpe and strongly urged him not to attempt the exercise again . Once into the Commons , he might never find a way out . But still the young man said , " I would know more . " Again Bandar found the hard fixity of Wasselthorpe 's gaze difficult to bear . He wondered that such an unnaturally concentrated mind had achieved only a third-tier degree , or that he should have come from an aristocracy that frequently showed the less fortunate effects of inbreeding . " Then let it be later , " said the nonaut . " I must think on the matter . " By " later , " he meant , " never . " But from what the two men said to each other after Bandar returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Orgulon . He turned and gazed out at the landscape unrolling far beneath them as the old orange sun eased itself down to the horizon . He had been looking forward to the vast openness of the Swept . Now a cloud of foreboding seemed to have risen before him . AT FARFLUNG , Bandar disembarked from the balloon-tram without speaking again to the two other passengers . He hurried through the terminal to find a ground car he could hire to take him to where the Orgulon docked . Frugality would ordinarily have inspired him to suggest that the three of them share transportation , but he wanted to put distance between himself and Wasselthorpe . The young man 's unusual facility for entering the Commons disturbed him . As the sun slipped behind the hills at whose feet stood Farflung , the car brought him to a stretch of docks . Beyond lay the Swept . The long grass that covered the flatlands to the far horizon rippled under a constant breeze like waves on a straw-colored sea . Bandar paused to look out at the immensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoked now gave way to a feeling that he was where he was supposed to be . It was not a sense of contentment , rather it was a sentiment of being in the right place , doing the right thing . He drew in , then released a deep breath and strode toward the landship . Close up , the Orgulon was enormous . The side that lay by the dock was a wall of lustrous wood , pierced by windows large and small , each bordered by polished metal . The vessel 's body was a great oblong with rounded ends , resting on a network of shock-absorbing cylinders that connected it to an eight-axled chassis from which extended a score of huge rubber wheels . Bandar presented his invitation to a security officer who stood at the base of the gangplank that sloped up to an upper deck . She consulted a list and found his name , then gave him a searching look . " The passengers are all traveling in pairs , " she said , " one suffering from the lassitude and one to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prepared a story . " My brother has the disease but is too ill to travel . I came to evaluate the alleged cure . " She made a noncommittal noise and named a deck and cabin number . He went aboard and followed signs to his appointed quarters . There he stowed his bag before reposing upon the sleeping pallet and allowing its systems to restore his energies . After a while , he felt motion as the Orgulon left the dock and slowly moved out onto the Swept . A little later a steward tapped on his door and announced that the passengers were summoned to dinner . The easiest route to the dining salon took Bandar across a spacious promenade deck that covered most of the landship 's upper surface , except for raised platforms fore and aft on which stood the great vertical pylons whose rotating vanes stole from the ever-blowing wind the ship 's motive power . He would have stopped to watch their operation and to look out across the prairie to where great cloud formations moved in the far distance like mobile mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side . The older man 's appearance had altered - his face had taken on a different shape and his skin had noticeably darkened . Unconventionality was not uncommon among the aristocracy , Bandar knew . He wondered if the pair were competing in one of those odd contests that members of the upper strata indulged in as recreation , questing after some list of unlikely objects which might include a landship captain 's cap . He decided that the two were , at least , strange , and resolved to stay clear of them . Immediately below the promenade deck , the Orgulon 's dining area echoed the Swept in giving an impression of vast openness . It stretched from one side of the vessel to the other , its paneled walls broken by great round windows that looked out on the now night-shaded grasslands and its glistening wooden floor covered by large circular tables draped in snowy cloth and aglitter with crystal and cutlery . Bandar found that he was assigned to a certain seat and was relieved to discover that it was a good distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and Bandar made appropriate gestures of head and hands to acknowledge them . They seemed a heterogeneous mix , varied in ages , social ranks and genders , their only commonality that they came in pairs and one member of each couple was in some stage of the lassitude . Across from Bandar a large woman exercised unchallenged control of whatever conversation had preceded his arrival . She wore swathes of some frilled material , with a braided necklace of precious metal around her wattled neck and a thick scattering of blue-fire gems in her upswept white hair . Her tone bespoke a habit of being listened to . Her apparent spouse , a stocky fellow with neck and cheeks discolored by a dark birthmark , sat dull-eyed to her left . His face was frozen by the lassitude 's paralysis but Bandar suspected that even in his prime he would seldom have dared to interrupt the ceaseless torrent of her opinions . " We will see wonders , " she declared as Bandar took his seat . " I am sure of it . " She fixed the nonaut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of a skeptic . Do n't trouble to deny it . I never err in my assessments of character . It is a gift . " " A gift you are clearly happy to share , " Bandar said , " even with complete strangers who have demonstrated no desire to receive it . " " An aptitude for seeing the truth obliges one to speak it , " the woman said . " I am Brond Halorn , " she said . " This is my spouse , Bleban . " Bandar named himself . " Why are you unaccompanied ? " He told her the tale of a brother . " So there it is , " she said , looking around the table . " He is indeed a skeptic , else he would have brought his poor brother along to receive Father Olwyn 's blessing . " She concluded her remark with a wave of a beringed hand that signified that all had turned out precisely as she had predicted . Bandar recognized a habitual gesture . He defended himself . " I am no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can be convinced of the unlikely , even the seemingly impossible , though the proof need be unequivocal . " A motion of her hand indicated that his arguments were too vapid to merit an answer . This movement Bandar also took as part of her characteristic repertoire . " You will see , " she said , then resumed her address to the table in general . Bandar offered a gesture of his own , though he did so beneath the lip of the table , out of her line of sight . A few moments later , stewards began to bring in the first course : a jellied salad studded with morsels of fungus that had a unique flavor , like aromatic smoke . Bandar enjoyed the dish but the several more that followed were all built around the same unusual ingredient , and the taste began to cloy . A steward informed him that it was a delicacy called " truffles of the Swept . " When the last course was eaten and the servers were clearing away , Brond Halorn favored the table with more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruminated on his plans to measure gravitational fluxes . But her voice and his thoughts were both soon interrupted by the sound of a gong that drew all attention to a dais at one end of the salon where a cone of light now shone down from the ceiling . A moment of expectation passed , then the beam of illumination filled with swirls of moving color that resolved into a projection of a slight man with a beatific expression . The simulacrum introduced himself as Father Olwyn and welcomed the passengers . He announced a program that recommended study and action as the Orgulon traveled the Swept , preparing the travelers for a " ceremony of inculcation " leading to " a wondrous transformation . " Bandar sighed and lowered his eyes , placing the fingertips of one hand to the center of his brow . The fellow 's discourse rang of a fraudster 's patter . He looked away from the projected image , to find himself the object of a glare from Brond Halorn that would doubtless have wondrously transformed him into some species of small , squeaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was assuring the passengers that he knew what it was to suffer the lassitude ; he had borne the affliction himself . After a suitably dramatic pause , he then announced , " But I was healed . " A great hush , that of an expectant crowd that dares not even breathe , filled the salon . Then the image said , " As you will be healed , " and Bandar heard a mass sigh of released breath , and a low moan from Brand Halorn . Olwyn finished by instructing the passengers in a four-syllable mantra - fah , sey , opah - that he assured them would " open the first door " in the process of healing . Bandar knew more than most about the effects of chants and mantras , and was confident that this one would do no more than exercise the jaws of those passengers , unaffected by the lassitude , who could still move theirs . The room took up the chant . The white-haired woman 's voice rose above the rest and her loud conviction drew her table mates-though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others and soon the mantra filled the room , accompanied by hands slapping tables and heels thudding against the floor . Bandar looked about him and saw a wide range of emotions - hope , resignation , embarrassment , cynicism , fervor - as the passengers responded to the dynamics of their own psyches . He saw Phlevas Wasselthorpe regarding him with interest ; then the young man 's eyes moved away . The chanting went on and on , and Bandar saw many whose eyes glazed and lost focus , though when he looked to Halorn he saw that she had been waiting for his gaze to come her way . She continued to chant " fah , sey , opahl " in an emphatic voice , while her hand made peremptory motions , palm up and fingers tight against each other , that summoned Bandar to join the chorus . He frowned , just as the projected Olwyn lifted his hands and cried , " Enough ! " Silence fell , broken only by Brond Halom 's throaty voice , edging on the hysterical , chanting the mantra twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Olwyn declared that he expected some of them to feel already the effect of the mantra , which he claimed would generate in them a numinous attribute he called " chuffe . " " Yes ! " said Brond Halom , eyes afire . She could indeed feel chuffe rising within her . Olwyn made some final remarks about the gravitational peculiarities of the Swept being conducive to the generating of chuffe and recommended more chanting and meditation . Then his image disappeared . A hubbub of voices rose as the passengers responded as their natures dictated to the message and its bearer . At Bandar 's table , Brond Halorn again took up the chant and a few others around the room did likewise . Bandar avoided her accusatory gaze by turning in his seat to survey the salon . Then someone shouted , " Look ! " and he glanced about until he saw that all eyes in the room had been drawn to the table where Erenti Abbas and Phlevas Wasselthorpe sat . But it was not the pair from the balloon-tram who were the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman whose rigidity of expression argued that she was in the grip of the lassitude . She had risen to her feet , while her apparent companion , a ruddy-faced man with dark hair in a complex coiffure , looked up at her , astonished . Her face was stiff with early-stage lassitude , but her slight body was quivering . She leaned forward , both hands on the tablecloth , looking down at the dark-haired man ; then Bandar saw her mouth open as if to yawn . Her shivering stopped as she raised both hands to her cheeks and kneaded the muscles of her jaw . " I can talk , " she said . Her companion rose and took her in his arms , his eyes glistening . They sat down together and held each other as the room filled with a rising tide of voices , one current of which was the chant of fah , sey , opahl Bandar lost his view of the objects of all this attention as people rose to their feet , some standing on their chairs , to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming voice of a ship 's officer restoring order . Stewards urged passengers to retake their seats , then produced a selection of liqueurs and essences . Bandar chose a tincture of Red Abandon , a fiery liquor that had been a favorite in his long-ago days as an Institute undergraduate . He sipped it and avoided eye contact with anyone as the room settled . The circumstances were too pat , the timing highly suspect : the afflicted and those who cared for them had been presented with a meaningless mantra , then moments after it was chanted someone was visited by a miraculous cure . As a nonaut , he had seen at first hand the power of myth and supposition , and he had no doubt that he had just witnessed a contrived performance . Now the dark-haired man was making some kind of speech that Bandar could n't have heard , even if he 'd cared to listen , because the whitehaired virago across the table was chanting fah , sey , opah in a guttural undertone . Then the young woman 's companion escorted her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promenade deck . Some of the passengers were enthused by what they had seen . Others expressed doubts . Bandar sipped his liqueur , then ordered another . He took no part in the debates that now broke out around him , though to himself he thought , The sick should not be subjected to such hardhearted shenanigans . He did not know how Father Olwyn would gain from flim-flammery , but Bandar would have bet a month 's emporium receipts that this entire expedition was aimed at transferring the contents of someone 's coffers to someone else 's . " Well , skeptic , " said the white-haired woman , " what do you make of that ? " Bandar 's only answer was a slight lift and subsidence of one shoulder , which earned him a single syllable delivered in a harsh tone followed by Brond Halorn 's observations , addressed to no one in particular , concerning rock-headedness and narrow-mindedness among those whose cerebral equipment was obviously not well connected to their visual apparatus . " They can not see what they will not understand , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now done their work . " I saw and I understood all too well , " he said . " Indeed , better than those who see only what they hope to see . " His show of resistance provoked a tirade of invective . When Bandar tried to correct her , his efforts were met with a renewed chant of fah , sey , opah , accompanied by rhythmic hand clapping . His glass empty , he turned away to seek a steward and while his third installment of Red Abandon was being poured , he saw Phlevas Wasselthorpe making his way among the tables . Bandar downed the liqueur in one gulp , and when his eyes stopped watering he noticed that the fellow was now quite near . Relieved of any trepidation by the effects of the drink , he rose and greeted him , but instead of answering , the young man gestured to his lips and jaw and made wordless sounds . " You have the lassitude ? " Bandar said and felt an inchoate urge to help the odd young fellow . Wasselthorpe spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbas , now joined them , and told Bandar that the disease was in its early stage . " It comes and goes . " Bandar offered his sympathy . The young man grunted something that his older companion apparently understood . Abbas relayed the information to Bandar . " My young friend wonders if you would tell him more about the Commons . It has piqued his interest . " Bandar saw no reason not to . If Wasselthorpe was destined to be imprisoned in his own paralyzed flesh until released by an early death , it would be a kindness to show him the Commons , providing Bandar guided him only to its gentler Locations . He offered to meet them out on deck after he had changed his garments ; Brond Halorn 's manner of countering opposition had left his shirt front dampened by her saliva . A short time later he joined them on the lighted promenade deck and they strolled toward the forecastle where the windvanes rotated . Abbas asked him what he thought of Father Olwyn 's promises . Bandar was blunt . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply skeptical of any who claimed a mystic cure . " The conversation turned to the Commons . Now that the immediate effects of Red Abandon were fading , Bandar found himself divided about taking Wasselthorpe into the Commons . Either the young man possessed an uncanny ability to focus his mind or he was a latent psychotic . Bandar expressed his concerns in candid language . Erenti Abbas vouched for the young man 's sanity and declared him to be a prodigy when it came to intensity of concentration . Bandar acceded to the request . In his first years at the Institute , he had been counted a rare talent . Perhaps he was about to assist one who would become a renowned nonaut - if the lassitude did n't kill him . He led the pair to where the promenade deck met the raised forecastle . He had Wasselthorpe sit cross-legged , back against the bulkhead , hands folded in his lap . Bandar sat opposite him , knee to knee , the traditional teaching posture . The lassitude had stilled Wasselthorpe 's lips and tongue but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and voice the tones with him . " When the portal appears , tell me . I will talk you through it . " They began with the thran they had used on the balloon-tram . Scarcely more than a moment passed before Wasselthorpe grunted to show that he had achieved a vision of the door behind which shone a golden light . Bandar spoke softly , guiding him through the tones that opened the door , warning him to wait beyond the threshold . Wasselthorpe sang the tones , pitch perfect , then grunted again . Bandar had to exert his maximum effort to form his own portal and open it . " Wait , " he said , " for the light to fade . More important , allow me to catch up . " The young man had gone through like a fourth-level adept . Bandar sought for him in the glow and soon had a sense of his nearness . Here the lassitude did not affect Wasselthorpe 's speech , and his voice came to the noonaut clearly . " Where am I ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After a while , he asked Wasselthorpe , " Now where are you ? " The young man said he was in his boyhood home , looking out a window . Something about the scene outside disturbed him , so Bandar told him to think instead of the place where he had been most secure and happy . Wasselthorpe immediately announced that the scene had shifted to the room where he had spent much of his youth . When Bandar had him describe the setting , they soon found the anomaly : a dark mirror that should not have been in the back of the wardrobe . In its depths was a reflection that troubled the young man . Bandar urged him not to fear his Shadow and to step boldly through it . Here was the moment when their expedition might easily have ended ; it took discipline acquired through rigorous practice before most apprentice nonauts could face their own rejected attributes ; some never could manage it and left the Institute for other pursuits . Yet it did not surprise Bandar that , moments later , Wasselthorpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path that led to a tarn of dark water . " Go down the path , " Bandar said , and when he reached the water , the noonaut told him to dive in . Then he hurried to descend his own staircase down to the road that led into the outer arrondisement of the Commons . He found an almost transparent , two-dimensional version of Wasselthorpe standing between the walls , looking about with wonder . He wanted to know where he had come to . Bandar explained , then he touched Wasselthorpe 's arm , performing a nonaut mentalism , and the young man 's image solidified into three dimensions . Now they were linked for the duration of their stay in the Commons , so Bandar did not have to worry about losing him among the thousands of dreamers that invisibly surrounded them . He was shocked when the young man said that he was aware of others passing by , seeing them as motes of light in the corners of his vision . That was an ability that nonauts worked years to acquire . Bandar thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons , so close to the prime arrondisement where the characteristic entities were to be found in their purest form . He was about to suggest that they visit one or two of the more benign Locations , but Wasselthorpe was now peering down the road , his virtual body slightly leaning in that direction as if pulled by magnetism . He said , " I wish to explore . " " A little , no more , " Bandar said . " I grow concerned . " " But I am fine . " Bandar explained that before they had come here he had been willing to take Wasselthorpe for one of those rarities with unusually biddable memories who find it easy to enter the Commons . But now he did not know what to think . Wasselthorpe was apparently not a natural , yet he could effortlessly detect the presence of the dreamers around them when even Bandar must work to catch a glimmer . Wasselthorpe said , " I feel no fear . I am where I should be . " The phrase troubled Bandar . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " Wasselthorpe said . " We should go back , " Bandar said . The young man looked around . " Are we in danger ? " " Not I , " said Bandar , " but you may be in great danger . " But Wasselthorpe perceived no threat . " Why should we return ? " " To see if you can , " Bandar said . To be called into the Commons presupposed an entity that did the calling , a powerful archetype that Wasselthorpe , lacking an arsenal of thrans and mentalist techniques , could not withstand . " I sense no ill intent here , " Wasselthorpe said . He begged to be allowed at least to look about and promised that at the first sign of danger , Bandar could lead him back . Perhaps it was the lingering confidence of Red Abandon , but Bandar acceded , at which point Wasselthorpe said , " I have an inclination to go down the road , " adding , when Bandar let his anxiety show , " It is only a mild inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " anything , " Bandar said . " What could happen ? " " I can not name any of the particular menaces because to name is to summon . " Wasselthorpe found the concept hard to encompass . " It is not a laughing matter , " said Bandar . " Naturals who find their way into the Commons almost never find their way out . The unprotected consciousness is soon absorbed by a pure archetype . " Apprentice noonauts , hearing of these things , always showed some degree of fear . Yet Wasselthorpe displayed no concern and Bandar felt a rising curiosity about this odd young man . He offered a bargain : they would go down the road together , but Bandar 's commands must be instantly heeded . Wasselthorpe agreed and made to set off , but Bandar delayed their going to teach the young man the strongest of the thrans : the three , three , and seven , whose tones would hide them from the characteristic entities . He bade the young man sing it loudly and without cease , then linked his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They soon reached the divide that separated the threshold from the first level of the Commons . Because Bandar was conducting the journey , it presented as an old stone bridge across a black river . On the other side was an open space in which the " usual suspects " sat or stood or milled about . Bandar was surprised to note that near the far end of the bridge sat the Hero . His Helper , as always , was nearby . That the Hero appeared in such proximity meant that that archetype must be the entity whose influence was most dominant in Wasselthorpe 's personality . Odd , he thought , / would have predicted the Pool for naivete and the seeker for his exaggerated interest in unraveling mysteries . The Fool was indeed nearby , but although the seeker was Bandar 's own dominant archetype , it was wandering far back in the crowd . They had meanwhile reached the middle of the bridge . Bandar , his arm still linked with Wasselthorpe 's , sought to restrain his further progress . The young man continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled against Bandar 's grip . Now a curious thing happened : the Hero 's head came up as if something had attracted its attention . The Helper , too , showed increased alertness . Bandar saw that many of the other archetypes had stopped their characteristic activities and had turned toward the bridge . That should n't happen , was his first thought . To Wasselthorpe , he said , " Louder . " The young man increased his volume but still his body seemed to yearn toward the archetypes . " This is wrong , " Bandar said , " as if they sense us . " The Hero had turned to face them , even though the insulating thran should have denied it any perception of their presence . Now it took a step toward them . The Helper followed , as did some of the other entities , including the Wise Man . The Father left the Mother and Child and moved toward the bridge . Wasselthorpe was still chanting , but his volume had decreased . Bandar hauled on his arm , trying to pull him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh resisting with unexpected strength . Bandar now added his voice to the thran . The Hero stopped and stood still , its head turning this way and that as if listening for an elusive sound . The other entities also paused . The nonaut had , with difficulty , returned Wasselthorpe to the top of the arched span . Now the young man exerted himself and would go no farther back . Worse , he stopped chanting the thran to half-turn toward Bandar and say , " Wait ! " Bandar recognized the look on Wasselthorpe 's face ; it was the " wild surmise " that gripped apprentice noonauts when they first felt a resonance between their own psyches and the pure entities that blended within them to make them who they were . It was not a look he wanted to see on the face of an uninstructed beginner . " Listen , " the young man said . Listening was the last thing Bandar intended . He chanted more loudly , almost straining the throat of his virtual body . He dragged at Wasselthorpe 's arm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A frisson of horror went through the nonaut as he saw the Hero step forward again . It set the heel of one boot onto the stones of the bridge . Impossible ! thought Bandar . It ca n't do that ! The stones of the bridge moved beneath his feet , grating against each other . Wasselthorpe stood as if entranced . The Hero raised its foot to take another step . Bandar had no doubt that the entity was somehow aware of them , despite the thran , that it was drawn to them by an attraction so powerful that it could suppress the elemental forces that separated Locations in the Commons . He yanked on Wasselthorpe 's arm , spinning the young man around to face him . He could not speak while intoning the thran , but he let his terror show in his face and raised one hand in a gesture that said , What are you waiting fort To his great relief , he saw understanding dawn . Wasselthorpe rejoined him in chanting the thran . The Hero 's second foot did not step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the young man did as he was bid , Bandar pulled him back to the road that was the threshold of the nosphere . Without delay , he sang the tones that opened an emergency gate and thrust Wasselthorpe through the rift the moment it appeared . Moments later , Bandar came back to the deck of the Orgulon . He leaped to his feet and leaned over the still-seated form of the young man , shaking his shoulders until the eyes opened and focused on him . Wasselthorpe mumbled something and Bandar sat down again . " I believe he is all right . " " He has also regained the power of speech , " said a female voice . The security officer was standing over them . Abbas explained about Wasselthorpe 's intermittent bouts of rigor . The woman showed a professional 's unwillingness to accept second-hand testimony . She squatted before Wasselthorpe and said , " What happened ? " The young man was still dazed . Bandar stepped in . " We encountered an archetype , " he said . " More significant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword . His helmet had wings , " said Wasselthorpe , his gaze turned inward . Bandar found the detail interesting . " That 's one of its earliest forms . " Wasselthorpe added more specifics of his view of the entity . He had seen a dawn-time barbarian wearing chain mail and the skin of an extinct canine predator . Then he lapsed back into introspection . The security officer glowered . " What have you done to him ? " " Nothing , " said Bandar . He gave a short explanation of what had happened on the lip of the prime arrondisement . " But he is fine . " The security officer expressed surprise and distaste that anyone would venture into such a hell for a pastime . Bandar assured her he had no intention of accompanying Wasselthorpe into the Commons again . She seemed to want to take the discussion further and Bandar was conscious of not having made a good impression . But her next words were never uttered because there came a panicked scream from the darkness that shrouded the foredeck . THE ENSUING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared that a passenger - indeed it was the dark-haired man whose female companion had been miraculously cured of the lassitude - had fallen from the foredeck . The landship 's great wheels had crushed him . The captain , a small , precise man , came on deck and ordered the vessel stopped , then dispatched a flying gig to retrieve the corpse . The security officer held a whispered consultation with the captain , who then announced that the passenger 's death might have involved a criminal offense . The slim young woman became hysterical . Protesting that it had been an accident , she was led below by the security officer . The passengers had crowded around in the way that bystanders at horrific events often do . Bandar sought solitude by the landship 's rail and reflected on what had transpired in the Commons . He was deeply troubled by the Hero 's seeming awareness of them despite the thran , and especially its determination to come for them directly across the bridge . That should have been impossible . When he refocused his powerful memory on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eluded him at the time . While the Hero had blindly sought Wasselthorpe , Bandar now realized that the Helper had not just been following its master . Its eyes had not lacked focus , nor were they directed at Wasselthorpe . They had been aimed straight at Guth Bandar . It sensed me , he thought . Thran or no thran , it knew I was there . It was a worrisome thought . Bandar did not care to be absorbed and tipped into permanent psychosis . But even if he were willing to go mad , his choice would not have been the Helper , insanely serving some blustering hero . He shuddered and knew that he was not just responding to the chill breeze off the night prairie . Abbas and Wasselthorpe joined him after the body had been removed and the crowd cleared . They speculated on how the poor fellow might have come to fall overboard . Bandar offered the opinion that the landship might have encountered a transient gravitational cyst , causing the man to unbalance and tumble over the rail . The conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to investigate , and he excused himself , then hurried below to fetch his measuring equipment . But when he came back on deck and activated his device , he detected nothing out of the ordinary . The security officer approached him as he adjusted settings and calibrated norms . " Now what are you up to ? " she wanted to know . Bandar told her . His explanation earned him a look that let him know that he was becoming one of her least favorite passengers . Deciding it would be best to retire , he pocketed his equipment and went to his cabin . It had been a tiring day , so Bandar decided to combine his concern about Wasselthorpe and the Hero with his need for rest . He fell asleep , allowed himself to slip into a dream , then took control . He transported himself to the threshold and set off for the prime arrondisement with the intention of examining the bridge and the archetypes - especially the Hero and Helper - beyond the barrier . He had scarcely taken three strides , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a cold shock through his virtual torso . Startled , he turned to see what had accosted him and found himself looking up into the pleased face of Phlevas Wasselthorpe . " What are you doing ? " Bandar said . " I am dreaming . " " This is very wrong , " said the nonaut . " You should not be here . " The young man counseled him to be unconcerned . " It is only a dream . " " Yes , " said Bandar , " but it is my dream . " " No , it is mine , " said the other . " You are a figment . " " Tell me , " Bandar said , " when you look at me , do I seem to change in any way ? Or is my form constant ? " The other looked him up and down . " It is peculiar , but you do seem to remain unchanged , whereas the woods behind you have been several different kinds of forest . " " What does that tell you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hundred things , none of them good . I will open us a gate . " Bandar sounded the first few notes of the emergency exit thran . He was astonished to find himself silenced . Wasselthorpe had placed a hand over Bandar 's mouth . The hand felt very real . This time the shock of contact was strongly colored by a bolt of fear . Bandar struggled and with a great effort managed to wrench himself free . He backed away , saying , " Oh , this is much worse than not good . I should appear to you as at best a shifting image . Instead you not only see me but can lay hands on me and prevent my following my own will . " " I am sorry , " said Wasselthorpe . " I do not want to depart . " " I want nothing but , " said Bandar . " Do you not understand that you frighten me ? " " I do not wish to . " The young man looked around at the shifting landscape . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is meant to be ? " That was precisely what frightened Bandar . " Neither of us is experiencing an ordinary dream , " he said . " Some force is shaping us to its own ends . In the Commons , the only such force is an archetype intent on absorbing a consciousness . That way lies madness . " " I do not feel irrational , " said Wasselthorpe . " My mind seems unusually clear , considering that I am dreaming . " " Again , a worrying sign , " said Bandar . " My sense of things tells me that you are being drawn into the role of Hero and that I am being pressed into the part of the Helper . " " I want from you only advice , " Wasselthorpe said . " Let us be exact , " said Bandai . " You feel compelled to enter more deeply into the Commons and you want me to be your guide . " " I suppose . " " I refuse . " " Why ? " " Because the end of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by insanity and certain death . And poor Bandar , towed along helpless in your train , suffers a comparable doom . " Wasselthorpe found the warning hard to believe . " All will be well , " he said . " I am certain of it . " Bandar informed him that that was always the Hero 's sure belief , right up until the moment the dragon 's teeth closed upon his tender parts . Now Wasselthorpe disputed the contention that he was ruled by the Hero . " Why can I not be a blend of several archetypical entities , like you and anyone else ? " Bandar told him to look at himself . The young man looked down and Bandar saw mild surprise take possession of his face . Wasselthorpe was clad in chain mail , scuffed boots , and rough trousers bound up by criss-crossing straps . A shaggy gray pelt covered his shoulders , its paws tied across his chest . In one hand was a sword of iron . Bandar gestured and Wasselthorpe raised a hand and touched the wings that sprouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem familiar ? " The young man had to admit that it did . Yet , he was as thoroughly unconcerned as a Hero would be . Bandar suggested that he ought to open a gate so they could discuss the situation in the waking world , where it was easier to resist an inclination to madness . He was chagrined to see the other 's face fill with heroic resolve . " No , " Wasselthorpe said . He was here to do something , and felt that he must do it . Bandar had backed a little farther away ; Wasselthorpe was accompanying his declaration with sweeping gestures , and only now noticed that he was doing so with the hand that held a sword . Considerately , he laid the weapon down on the road . Instantly , it disappeared from there and reappeared in his grasp . " What do you think the " something " you are here to do might be ? " Bandar said . The other spoke without reflection . " I must search . " " Search for what ? Something nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insatiable appetite ? " A blank look came over Wasselthorpe . He did not know , he said , but he would know it when he saw it . " Oh , my . " Bandar put his hands over his eyes and shook his head . " All right , " he said . It did no good to argue with a Hero . But he begged to be allowed to shape the adventure . That way they stood some chance of surviving it . The young man agreed to follow his advice . The nonaut said , " Look around and tell me if there is anything that draws your attention . " Wasselthorpe immediately found that something about the woods beyond the field interested him . " Very well , " said Bandar , " let us approach them . But I must lead . " Wasselthorpe agreed . " All right , " said the nonaut , though the situation was far from it , and asked the young man to indicate the direction in which he wanted to travel . Wasselthorpe closed his eyes and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonaut asked how far he thought they should go , the answer was , " Not far . " Bandar turned the globe and regarded the proposed line of travel . A short distance away was the entrance to a Class Three Event . " Curious , " he said . He put away the globe . He would have liked to call an end to the expedition here and now so that he could mull the coincidence : here they were traveling the Swept , a legacy of the War Against the Dree , and now a strange young man who was powerfully influenced by the Hero had a strong urge to enter the Event that the war had carved out in the Commons . " Just a coincidence ? " Wasselthorpe suggested . Of course it was a coincidence , Bandar said , and that worried him even more . In the waking world a coincidence was just a random juxtaposition of events , devoid of meaning . But in the Commons , coincidence was the most meaningful circumstance of all , the immensely potent force that tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " it is coincidence that connects everything to everything else . " Wasselthorpe 's reaction troubled him further . The young man ought to be afraid , yet he was not . He pointed the sword once more . " I must go there , " he said . " Does it mean I will die ? " Bandar did not think so . The choice of that particular Event was less worrisome than many another he might have chosen . But he warned again that Wasselthorpe must let him be their guide . " I will . " The nonaut took a firm grip on the young man 's sword arm . He taught Wasselthorpe a thran and when the rendition was perfect , Bandar cautioned him to continue the chant . It would keep the Location 's idiomats from detecting their presence and reacting to them as if they were part of the Event . " How bad would that be ? " " The Dree were appalling , " Bandar said , " and the war to resist them was particularly horrid . " The invaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pheromonically connected among all its members into one entity . They used their concentrated mental powers to enslave other species and force them to work and fight for the hive - especially the latter , because ritual combat was the basis of what passed for culture among the Dree . Status among the competing hives was everything , and status was gained and held by a hive 's success on the battlefield . Dree fighting style was mainly devoted to capturing prisoners that could be carried back to the captor 's hive and tortured . The telepathic Dree relished the anguish , fear , and despair of their victims , just as humans savored the flavors and textures of foods and essences . Fortunately , this strategic imperative meant that all their battle tactics centered on surrounding small groups of enemies for capture . Faced with a well-organized army determined to massacre them , the Dree were heavily outclassed . After the initial surprise of the invasion , the Dree were soon rolled up and confined to the territory now known as the Swept . No one wanted to dig them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregator was brought down from space to crush and bury the invaders , along with their unfortunate mind-slaves , beneath the flattened landscape . Wasselthorpe appeared to be affected by the tale . " Are you sure you want to go on with this ? " Bandar asked . " I am somehow called to go this way , " the young man said . " I must see what there is to see . " Bandar was still weighing his curiosity against his apprehension , though it could do no harm to visit the Event . But he reminded Wasselthorpe not to break off the chant . If either needed to speak , he would use hand signals to warn the other to increase the volume of the thran to keep them both covered . He led them to the node , opened the gate , and led them through . They stepped into open land beneath a sky splashed with stars . A wind whispered through tall trees and a stream chuckled not far away . Bandar took quick stock of the scene : they were near the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armored war vehicles and assault infantry were converging on the range of hills behind them where the Dree had consolidated their forces . He could hear the clicking and creaking of Dree warriors . The sound must have piqued Wasselthorpe 's interest because he abruptly ceased chanting . At once , a concentrated beam of energy lit up the area with green light and the ground at their feet bubbled and smoked . Bandar raised his voice and yanked at the young man 's arm , bringing him back to an appreciation of where they were . They waited briefly until the armored assault had passed them by , then moved downslope and across the stream into a pasture . The hemming was almost complete , and Bandar saw the massive aggregator above the horizon , blotting out the stars . Bandar motioned Wasselthorpe to increase his volume again and asked : did he feel any impulse to go this way or that ? The fellow looked about him and his attention was caught by something a little way off and he moved toward it . Bandar followed and found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon and four carbonized Dree . Wasselthorpe stepped down into the declivity and pried the corpses apart with his sword , revealing the intact upper half of one of the invaders . The young man stared at the dead thing until Bandar gestured for him to increase his volume again so the nonaut could speak . " No eyes , " he said , looking down at the rounded oblong of brown chitin that was something like a head . It had feathery antennae that , in life , stood upright to detect odor with fine precision . Nerve-rich regions on the torso and head detected vibration and rendered it as sound . At close range it could also detect bioelectrical fields . Wasselthorpe regarded the dead Dree without reaction . Bandar questioned him and learned that the young man felt no more urges . Apparently they had done whatever Wasselthorpe 's motivating entity wanted done . The nonaut examined the other man closely and was interested to see the trappings of the Hero fade , leaving the young man clad in unremarkable attire . He considered summoning an emergency exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice in one day could cause disorientation even to the experienced traveler . Instead , he brought out his map and navigated a path through a series of innocuous Locations where they would not even need to hide behind thrans . A short while later , he was able to ease Wasselthorpe through a conduit that would lead him back into normal sleep . But Bandar did not then wake himself . Nor did he return to the mission Wasselthorpe 's arrival had interrupted . There was no point going to the bridge to study the usual suspects . He had had a good close-up look at the pure archetype that was governing the strange young man . The noonaut wanted to think about what he had seen and so he made his way to a quiet Landscape that consisted of little more than a tiny patch of sandcolored rock , set in an endless ocean and shaded by a single Sincere/ Approximate palm tree . No idiomat ever came there , and Bandar had often wondered what role the simple setting could have played in human history . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted to reflect on the unprecedented sequence of events that had occurred since he had introduced Phlevas Wasselthorpe to the Commons . First , the young man had demonstrated an unheard-of ability to enter the nosphere . Bandar had studied naturals who could slip easily into the nosphere , but they did so at the sacrifice of their own identities . They became the archetypes that summoned them , disappearing into them so utterly that they no longer had any individual consciousness : there was only an archetype psychotically stalking the waking world , usually dealing out misery and horror until the authorities intervened . But Wasselthorpe had gone in and come out unaffected , as if he merely stepped from one room to another . More shocking still , he had been able to enter Guth Bandar 's dream and physically dominate the noonaut 's virtual flesh . Most disturbing of all , the young man 's consciousness had clearly made a connection with the Hero , yet he had not been absorbed by it . Wasselthorpe 's accomplishments represented two highly unlikely results and one that was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert knowledge , anyone remotely like him . Another worrisome thought occurred as Bandar sat beneath the palm tree . The Hero never went anywhere without the Helper . Bandar had played that role , indeed had slipped into it so readily that it was as if he had himself been suborned by that characteristic entity . Yet here was Bandar , thinking rational thoughts , when he should have been drowned in the soup of psychosis . A half-fashioned memory nudged at the edge of his awareness . He reached for it with a noonaut 's casual skill but was disturbed to feel it somehow slip away . He sought for it in earnest , focusing a great deal of his trained power , yet still it eluded him . Another attempted grasp , and then it was gone . The experience left Bandar troubled . It was bad enough that something impossible was going on inside Phlevas Wasselthorpe . But for a lifelong adept of the noosphere to find that elements of his own psyche could deftly avoid his grip brought the strangeness far too close to the essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he was unable to bring to the surface of his mind . To a noonaut , such a state of affairs must be deeply troubling . He awakened himself and made his way to the cabin Wasselthorpe shared with Erenti Abbas . He knocked and was admitted by the young man . Bandar inspected him and was satisfied he had sustained no harm from his experiences of the night . Wasselthorpe apologized for having overborne Bandar 's objections to the mission he had felt compelled to fulfill and for forcing Bandar to guide him . Bandar waved away the sentiment . The events were over and he had no intention of repeating them . Now Wasselthorpe was wondering if he might someday take up the exploration of the noosphere . He even asked if he might study under Bandar . The noonaut felt the skin of his face cool and knew he must have gone pale . He informed Wasselthorpe that it would be kinder if he simply killed Bandar on the spot . " Be assured , I will never again go willingly with you into the Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's captain for the use of his gig to take him away forthwith so that he could never be pressed into the Hero 's service again . " But what of your research ? " Wasselthorpe asked . Bandar told him that he could take scant pleasure in it while constantly at risk of being dragooned to his death . The danger seemed remote to Wasselthorpe . " To me , " said Bandar , " it is inescapable . I am in grave peril if I remain within range of you , and since I do not know what that range is , I shall set the greatest possible distance between us . " He ended with a mollifying gesture and assured Wasselthorpe that he meant no offense . The young man said none had been taken . The matter mystified him . Bandar looked up into the young fellow 's mildly troubled face and again felt an urge to be of assistance to him . He fought it down and went in search of the captain . That interview was not a success : the captain called in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haj , and she refused to let anyone leave the ship until the questions regarding the death of the passenger were cleared up . " It was no accident , " she said . " But how can I be a suspect ? " he protested . " I had just emerged from a trance and was under your direct view when it happened . " " Perhaps you were there to distract me , " Haj said . Breakfast had been served and eaten by the time Bandar entered the dining salon . Apparently , Father Olwyn had also come and gone again , leaving the lassitude sufferers and their companions with a new mantra - bom , ala , bom-that would further elevate their chuffe . Brond Halorn , her hair still asparkle with blue-fire gems , was leading the most fervent group of chanters . When she saw Bandar enter and make his way to the remains of the buffet , she threw a challenging stare his way . Bandar declined to return her gaze and looked for an empty seat away from her devoted chorus . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wasselthorpe ; it would be rude to sit near them without speaking to them . He filled a plate with items from the chafing dishes-all , it turned out , featured variant renderings of the truffles of the Swept - and took it along with a steaming pot of punge back to his cabin . He slept for a while , allowing himself an ordinary dream cycle , and awoke feeling refreshed and more cheerful . He went on deck where he found the security officer . Again he offered reasoned arguments ; again they were rebuffed . " It is not some mere whim that prompts me to seek to depart , " he said . " My psyche is in danger as long as I am in proximity to that young man . " He unobtrusively indicated Abbas and Wasselthorpe , who were standing by the rail . An even deeper suspicion crept into Haj 's already dubious expression . " What exactly is your relationship to those two ? " she said . " I have no relationship . I encountered them on the balloon-tram on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who threaten your sanity ? " " No , but there is something odd about Wasselthorpe . He is able to do things he should not be capable of . " The security officer tilted her head to regard Bandar . " Both you and they stand out from the rest of the passengers , " she said . " You arrived claiming a lassitude-affected brother . His illness comes and goes . " " I am in danger . Last night Wasselthorpe invaded my dream . " Haj 's skepticism visibly intensified . " Uh huh , " she said . Bandar concluded there was no point in further argument . He went below and sat in his cabin until boredom made him take up his measurement equipment and go back on deck . If he could not escape , he might as well do something useful . He was taking readings from various points of the compass when Wasselthorpe approached him . " I have been thinking about what happened last night , " the young man said . " I do not wish to be impolite/ " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must refuse to discuss the matter with you . I would not still be here but Raina Haj will not let me depart . " " I am sorry you are troubled , " the other said . " For myself , I feel as if a door has opened on a world whose existence I 'd never heard of . Yet I grow increasingly sure that there is something for me there . " " A destiny , perhaps ? " said Bandar . Wasselthorpe 's normally serious expression broke under a sudden surge of excitement . " Yes , exactly ! A destiny ! " " You can not imagine how frightening that is , " said Bandar . " I do not know what you are or how you can do what you do . But such abilities , yoked to a sense of destiny , then coupled to the power to draw me , of all people , helplessly into your wake , are enough to give me the abdabs . " " I sense no harm in my fascination . " Bandar sighed . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surprises , many of them hideously final . " He begged the young man to let him be and told him that he resolved to sleep at odd times so that his dreams might be unviolated , and asked Wasselthorpe not to meddle with any other dreamers he might encounter in his sleep . The day wore on . Bandar would again have taken dinner in his cabin , but when he summoned a steward the fellow told him that Raina Haj had decreed that all passengers must dine together . Apparently the security officer had installed surveillance systems in the salon that could read and assess subliminal reactions among the passengers . She hoped some investigatory leads would develop from throwing them all together . Bandar decided he would demonstrate that he had no ties to Abbas and Wasselthorpe by dining at their table and making no attempt to hide his face . Two seats had been left empty-the dead man 's and his companion 's , who was confined to her quarters under guard . The ship 's first officer , who had sat there the previous night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Abbas were joined only by a retired couple from the Isle of Cyc , who were introduced as UIe Gazz and her spouse , Olleg Ebersol . He was paralyzed by the lassitude , while her face showed enough animation for both of them . They were enthusiasts of the Lho-tso school of practical enlightenment and she spoke glowingly of mantras and rising chuffe and the cure she expected . Ebersol 's opinions on these matters were impossible to determine but Bandar saw genuine suffering in the man 's eyes . The cuisine was again entirely built around truffles - Bandar wondered if the cruise might be some ploy to market the fungus , though how the lassitude and truffles might commercially intersect was beyond him . After the meal , Father Olwyn again appeared in simulacrum and offered a sermon that Bandar found all too vague , along with an exhortation for all to chant bom , bom ala bom . The chant rose throughout the room as Olwyn disappeared . Bandar dismissed the sermon as , " A pile of piety and platitudes , " at which UIe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the salon , where Brond Halorn was vigorously conducting more than half the passengers in a mass chant . The slap of dozens of hands on tables and feet on floorboards shook the room . Phlevas Wasselthorpe once more tried to draw Bandar into a discussion of their mutual experience in the Commons . Bandar again had to fight down an initial urge to help the young man , but he transformed the impulse into a brief lecture : " For your own good , do n't go there . And if you find yourself wandering the Commons , please do not seek my company . " He extracted a promise that Wasselthorpe would not sleep until later in the evening , then retired to his cabin to snatch as much rest as he could before their dreams might again overlap . He dreamt lucidly and the moment his nonaut 's senses detected the presence of Wasselthorpe in the Commons , he promptly woke himself and spent the rest of the night in meditation . WITH THE TIRED old sun barely creeping above the horizon , the passengers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truffles of the Swept - the flavor , though rich , soon cloyed . He took plain cakes and punge and carried them again to the table where Abbas and Wasselthorpe sat , tendered the basic formalities , then ate without offering conversation . As he was finishing his second mug of punge Bandar noted that the landship was slowing . The other two men did likewise and turned in their seats to peer out of one of the great round windows . Something attracted their attention and Bandar rose to look over their shoulders . For the first time since he had boarded the Oigulon he experienced a thrill of pleasure . " Those are Rover carts , " he said . The landship came to a halt near a place where a wide circle of the long grass had been trampled flat . Gangplanks extended themselves and the passengers debarked , the lassitude sufferers in whom the disease was most advanced being transported on come-alongs , small platforms fitted with gravity obviators and normally used to tow heavy baggage . Bandar came down onto the Swept , looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers was deployed and he heard some more blather about chuffe and mantras . But the noonaut 's attention was drawn to the Rovers and their vehicles . Seven of the lightweight , high-wheeled carts were spread around the rim of the flattened area . Made of plaited bamboo withes , each rode on two tall metal-and-rubber wheels , thin-spoked and fat-tired . Bamboo ribs curved from one side to the other , surmounted by a canopy of tightly woven grass to shade passengers from sun and rain . Each cart was drawn by a team of eight shuggras , round-eared , sharpincisored , oversized rodents bred up long ago from vermin . Their legs were long and powerful , ending in splayed hairless feet with spoon-shaped leathery digits . At the moment they crouched , resting but keeping up a constant muttering . Wasselthorpe also seemed to lack interest in Olwvn 's sermonizing . He was clearly curious about the Rovers and drifted in the direction of the nearest team . Bandar felt a strong impulse to warn him away . Shuggras were intensely social , but only amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover master 's family might suffer an unprovoked attack . The Rovers had been lying beneath the carts until the passengers came down from the Oigulon . Now they emerged and each went to his vehicle and pulled down a tailboard that unfolded into steps . Wasselthorpe was clearly surprised by the Rovers " nonhuman appearance . He asked Bandar if they were of ultraterrene origin . Now it was Bandar 's turn to be surprised : even a provincial lordling ought to have heard of Rovers . They had been sharing the planet with humans for eons . The nonaut wondered about the young man 's education . Much commonplace knowledge seemed to have eluded him . His plump mentor made a remark that revealed his unhappiness about exchanging the landship 's comforts for the more austere conditions of a Rover cart . Still , Abbas assumed a look of resignation and steered Wasselthorpe toward one of the vehicles . The young man was staring at the nearest Rover , a mature male who was showing his species " usual discomfort at direct eye contact . Bandar stepped up beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also briefly summarized the creatures " origins . " They are dogs ? " Wasselthorpe said . " That is not a word they like to hear , " Abbas said . They climbed into the cart , making its leather springs creak . On each side of the interior , four seats of woven wicker faced forward . Erenti Abbas expressed some relief that the seats were cushioned by pads of woven grass . He and Wasselthorpe took the foremost pair and Bandar sat behind the young man . The cart squeaked and bounced again as UIe Gazz and Olleg Ebersol boarded , the former helping her spouse into a seat behind Bandar . Despite the efforts they had made to elevate their chuffe , Bandar thought that Ebersol showed signs of sinking deeper into the lassitude . Two more passengers climbed in , a pair of sturdy young women who had the look of students . Bandar had seen them on the Orgulon but had not met them . The new arrivals named themselves as Corje Sooke and Poilus Ermatage , though in fact Ermatage did all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . They identified themselves as cohorts , a lifelong relationship of intense closeness practiced by citizens of the county of Fasfallia . The remaining seat was soon filled by the slim young woman whose companion had been crushed beneath the landship . She was escorted to the cart by Raina Haj , demanding all the way to be allowed to leave and return home . Haj said something to her that Bandar did n't catch but which clearly did not please its hearer . She flung herself onto the seat cushion , crossed her arms and glowered at all of them before turning to glare at the Swept . Bandar overheard Abbas and Wasselthorpe discussing the new arrival - he learned that her name was Flix - but their low voiced conversation was interrupted by their Rover 's securing of the cart 's tailboard , accompanied by a yelp that Bandar knew meant " Important information follows . " " Yaffak I am called , " the Rover said in his species " odd way of speaking , that always sounded to Bandar like a modified howl . Seeing incomprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated the statement for them . Yaffak went around to the front of the cart and leaped into the driver 's uncovered seat . He seized the reins and flourished a whip , and in a moment eight whining shuggras pressed powerful shoulders against the padded harness . The cart jerked forward but settled into a smooth passage across the unnaturally level ground . They picked up speed , racing straight into the sunrise , leaving a cart-wide track through the long grass . Bandar watched the other carts with interest . He had learned from his studies that Rovers were intensely competitive , with a strong instinct for hierarchy . A pack of Rovers driving their carts across the Swept should be , he thought , a kind of race , each driver struggling to be the leader . He was disappointed , therefore , to see the carts take up a line-abreast formation . " I do n't understand , " he said . " Do n't understand what ? " said Erenti Abbas . Bandar explained about the Rovers " supposed competitive spirit . That brought a dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extolled the Lho-tso philosophy of fatalism . Erenti Abbas engaged her from an epicurean 's point of view , using his enjoyment of food as a metaphor for seizing pleasure from the passing transience of life . Then Poilus Ermatage weighed in with an observation that , from the perspective of manure , the whole cycle of fertilization , growth , harvest , processing , and consumption was just a complex way of producing fresh manure . It was the kind of discussion Bandar remembered from his early years at the Institute , when undergraduates would sit around a tavern table and regale each other with beery perspectives on the meaning of life . Now he offered the view that some things were effectively eternal , and cited the nosphere as an example of permanence , whereas individual human lives tended to be repetitions of generic themes , with minor embellishments . Wasselthorpe protested that his life was not a trivium . No one had ever been him , doing what he was doing , in the way he was doing it , and for the reasons that moved him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was indubitably correct . But from a wider scope , whatever the shape of Wasselthorpe 's life might be , it differed only marginally from those of the billions upon billions of young men who had come before him . " What is your quest : power , passion , riches , spiritual insight ? Each has been looked for and found - or not found - countless times . At best you might add some slight variation to the grand scheme . But the effort is ultimately no more important than to have shifted one grain of a desert 's sand . " Bandar saw forlorn sadness wash across the young man 's face . There was pain somewhere in his history , pain and loss . And Bandar 's glib words had somehow evoked a memory of it . Now something else stirred in the back of the nonaut 's mind : a vague sense that what he had said to Phlevas Wasselthorpe was completely untrue ; that this young man 's quest might be more than a minor variation on a theme . It is fatigue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And perhaps a disappointment brought on by the failure of the Rovers to live up to my romantic expectations . While he was immersed in his own thoughts , the discussion had moved on , but only to spread a glum mood over the other passengers . Conversation dwindled , then stopped . After a lengthening silence , Poilus Ermatage suggested singing the new chuffe-raising chant that Father Olwyn had taught the believers while Bandar had been inspecting the Rover carts . More nonsense , Bandar thought , but this one 's rhythm - tatumpa , ta-tey , repeated endlessly - matched the rocking of the cart as they drove across the grass . He joined in for a while , out of politeness , but soon the chanting and the growing heat of the advancing day made him sleepy . He broke off to enjoy a capacious yawn . Wasselthorpe also ceased to chant and wanted again to ply him with questions about the Commons . " The Commons is not for you , " the noonaut said . " Find another interest . " " But I am called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason not to go . Now I mean to make good some of the sleep I did not get last night . " He folded his arms across his small chest and leaned one shoulder against the upcurving rib that supported the cart 's plaited roof . He elicited a promise from Abbas to ensure that Wasselthorpe remained awake while Bandar slept . Bandar slipped into dream . His first impulse was to exert his noonaut ability to control its direction , but some other pan of him counseled letting it unroll under its own dynamic . He was in a garden , with neatly ordered lawn and well-tended but unremarkable flower beds . Wasselthorpe appeared and Bandar felt a frisson of fear before he realized that this was not an incursion of the other 's consciousness but merely a rendering of the young man created by Bandar 's own mind . He was in the Hero 's guise and , as Bandar regarded him , now memory filtered up from somewhere . He vaguely recalled the variant that wore mail , winged helmet , and wolf pelt . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon ordinary men , tearing its arm off so that it ran away and died . But then a worse threat loomed , though he could n't remember exactly what it was ; the information dated from his undergraduate years , before he had fully developed his memory . Besides , noonauts worked to remember categories , not individual incidents - the totality of the Commons was far more than any mind could encompass . Bandar observed Wasselthorpe-as-Hero cross the garden , sword held low and positioned for a coming thrust . Then the man shimmered and became just a sad-faced boy at play . He held a wooden sword and wore a toy helmet , but the way he thrust at empty air with the rough weapon showed a man 's determination . And the young face showed the same serious cast of expression that governed the mature man . Bandar sensed an unbearable poignancy in the scene and turned away . But now his gaze fell upon the Rover Yaffak . The creature stood disconsolate , ears drooping and black lips drawn downward . The noonaut took control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? Why do you grieve ? " Yaffak opened his mouth to answer but the only sound that emerged was an odd creaking . Bandar awoke to the creaking of the carts . They had slowed and the Rovers were driving them in a circle to create another broad area of trampled grass . Erenti Abbas rubbed his substantial stomach , expressing optimism that lunch was imminent . Bandar informed him that it was too soon for the passengers to be fed . They would be stopping to rest the shuggras , which were not built for the long haul and required frequent pauses . When the grass was flattened , the Rovers positioned the carts in a small circle at the center of the larger one , with the teams of shuggras facing outward . They lowered the tailboards that the passengers might dismount . Yaffak indicated the tall grass and said , " Empty your bodies . " Bandar translated the words into a more seemly phrase then asked , " How long will we stay ? " " Small time , " Yaffak answered . " Rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat comes . " Bandar relayed the sense of this to his fellow passengers , then watched with interest as Yaffak went to join the other Rovers in the center of the circled cans where one of them had piled up jerked meat and some kind of hard biscuits . He would have liked to see a display of Rover dominance-and-submission behavior , with the junior members of the pack shouldering each other aside to eat a larger share . Instead , the Rovers took their rations without ceremony and squatted down to chew . None looked at the others or demonstrated any of the displays Bandar 's studies had told him should be natural to them . After a while , Bandar shook his head and turned away . Wasselthorpe had wandered over and now asked if something disturbed him . Bandar revealed his puzzlement at the Rovers " uncharacteristic behavior . Wasselthorpe proposed that the Rovers might have changed their ways , but Bandar dismissed the idea as not possible . Rover consciousness was a thin layer over a deep-set mass of instinct . " They do not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the other suggested . " Perhaps this is how the lassitude affects them . " " No , " Bandar said . He explained the Rovers " reaction to illness , which was for the sick one to go away and either return cured or die alone . It was an instinct that protected the pack . They walked back to where Abbas sat in the shade of one of the carts . " You know a great deal about Rovers , " Wasselthorpe said . " Not much more than what is common knowledge . " The young man showed a puzzled countenance . " Not common to me , " he said . Bandar wondered aloud about what other commonplaces were unknown to Wasselthorpe . Abbas pointed out that the question was a tautology ; the young man could not be expected to know what else he did n't know . Bandar conceded the point . Provincial gentlemen were not required to know much beyond the folderols of fashion and the intricacies of social rank that separated one from one 's neighbors . " Yet he wears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look pass between Abbas and Wasselthorpe . " Though only third-tier , " said the fat man . Bandar shrugged . Third-tier matriculates from country aristocracy could not be expected to shine . Still , his ignorance was sometimes startling . " What was your field of study again ? " he asked . " Criminology . " " A curious pursuit for an aristocrat , " Bandar said . Abbas chimed in with a fresh note : Wasselthorpe could quote lengthy passages from Bureau of Scrutiny manuals . Bandar thought this a peculiar distinction . " I am sure the ability would be useful to a Bureau employee , but even the most dedicated scroot needs to encompass a wider field of knowledge than official manuals and standing orders . " Bandar saw Abbas give his student an odd look . " Perhaps the most dedicated scroot might not be aware of the need . " " A troubling thought , " said Bandar , " for it would mean the man was narrow and strange , like those too tightly wound types who know everything about some limited pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wasselthorpe seemed stung . " What is wrong with feeling that one has a calling ? " he said . The term gave Bandar a slight shiver . A call from the Commons was a summons that offered no return . " I remember a tale about a man who pursued a bright star . His eyes on its brilliance , he did not notice that his feet were leading him over a cliff . " Wasselthoipe said that he was not familiar with that story . Bandar was not surprised , since it was unlikely to be found in a scroot manual . They had walked back to their cart . " I believe I must sleep , " Wasselthorpe said . Indeed , he seemed to Bandar to be almost weaving on his feet . The nonaut felt an upwelling of concern : a sudden , unaccountable need for sleep could indicate that the unconscious was exerting its influence . " I will be sure to remain awake until you are done , " he told the young man . Indeed , he meant to keep an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed signs of distressed dreaming . The young man thanked him and laid himself down in the shade of the cart . After a moment he rolled onto his stomach and regarded the Rovers who , their meal finished , were now lying asleep . He drew Bandar 's attention to Yaffak , whose legs were twitching as if he dreamed of running , and wondered if there was any danger of his intruding into the Rover 's dream , as he had into Bandar 's . Bandar complimented him on his ambition , but assured him of the impenetrable Wall between Commonses of different species - though even as he said the words he thought about the Bololo and the hydromants of Gamza . There had been attempts to educate Rovers enough to have them explore their own Commons , but though some of the creatures had managed to get to the entry level of the Rover nosphere and even to view the archetypes in the prime arrondisement , they were too easily captured by the characteristic entities , and none made more than a few visits to the Rover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too much closed around by instinct , " Bandar said , " nor are their upper and lower brains well separated . Not far beneath Rover consciousness lies the Old Sea of presapience , where the great blind Worm swims eternally in pursuit of its own tail . " Abbas opined that the young man might be a visionary . His offhand tone annoyed Bandar who snapped back that Wasselthorpe might also be a full-tilt loon , the terms being all too often interchangeable . While they argued , Wasselthorpe slipped into slumber , his cheek pressed against the trampled grass . Bandar sat with his back against the cartwheel and engaged in a desultory conversation with Erenti Abbas . But he found the fat man 's cynicism difficult to take in sustained doses , and after a while their conversation lapsed and Abbas reposed himself to sleep , as had many of the passengers . A group of others , including the two couples from Bandar 's cart , had gathered to chant ta-tumpa , ta-tey , Brond Halom 's voice rising above the common chorus . The handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the journey sat in a ring , engaged in some game of chance that brought occasional shouts and hoots of celebration or schadenfreude . Time went by . Suddenly , Bandar saw the sleeping Yaffak give a mighty kick of one leg . The Rover 's eyes flew open , so wide that Bandar could see a rim of white around each great brown iris . Yaffak sprang into a crouch , growling something Bandar could not make out . The sound awoke the other Rovers , who gazed at their enraged fellow without visible emotion . The behavior went against everything Bandar knew about the Rovers . Yaf f ak 's display should have earned him either growls and bristling manes or lowered heads and turned-away eyes . The one reaction it should n't have brought was no reaction . But the rest still looked back at the snarling Rover with cold indifference , even as Yaffak stood erect , his ruff standing straight up and his teeth bared . He barked something that Bandar thought was , " Wrong ! " before he suddenly turned and raced toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one , yanked a strap that freed the eight from the wagon , and dug his heels into his mount and raced the whole team out into the long grass . The other Rovers had risen and for a moment Bandar thought they might go in pursuit . Then , as one , they visibly lost interest in the incident . They yelped at the stewards , who left their game and began to rouse the passengers to reboard the carts . " What of these ? " the chief steward called to the Rovers in their own language , indicating Bandar 's cart . " No seats , " said the largest of the Rovers , the one who ought to have been pack leader , by Bandar 's lights , but who showed none of the traits of a dominant male . Still , when the chief steward sought to argue with him about stranding eight passengers , the Rover showed his teeth . The crewman backed away , his hands offering placatory gestures , and came to Bandar 's cart . " I am sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Abbas had risen . " We can not stay here , " he said . " Right now , a ravenous fand might be slavering over the prospect of tender human flesh . Or a woollyclaw might amble by , bundle us all into a ball of crushed limbs and torsos , then roll us off to gratify its whelps . " " The air hangs heavy with the scent of angry Rover , " said the chief steward . " That will deter predators . But here is an energy pistol . " He produced the weapon from a pouch at his waist . " I advise you to remain in the cart until the Oigulon 's gig arrives . " " How long will that be ? " Bandar asked . " It will rendezvous with the Rover carts at a place east of here , bringing a luncheon . I will summon it on my communicator , and instruct it to come and pick you up as soon as supplies have been unloaded . You will not be here long . " Abbas said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have but the one , " the man said . Waving away further protestations and trailing assurances that all would soon be well , he went to where the impatient Rover leader waited , mounted the cart , and was gone . The stranded passengers reacted as their individual natures dictated : UIe Gazz was fatalistic , Poilus Ermatage cheerful , Abbas affecting a breezy unconcern beneath which Bandar thought to see a cool mind calculating risks and options . Flix 's black mood darkened to become stygian . The lassitude sufferers were as inert as ever . It was only after cataloging these impressions that Bandar thought to take notice of the still sleeping Phlevas Wasselthorpe . " With all the fuss , he should have awakened , " he said to Abbas . The fat man knelt and shook the sleeper , turned him over on his back and lightly slapped one cheek . He thumbed up one eyelid and saw nothing but white , the eyeball rolled up into the head . Abbas slapped him again , harder . There was no response . " He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he may be comatose . " " Try to rouse him , " Bandar said . " I will see what I can do . " He closed his eyes and summoned the portal , went through at record speed and was soon descending the staircase to the first level . The road was empty , except for scintillating flashes made by passing dreamers . Bandar knew he would not find Wasselthorpe among them . He summoned up a nonaut mentalism that he had not used in all the years since he had been an undergraduate learning his portfolio of techniques . But before he exercised the procedure , he paused and took thought for a moment . In the Commons , it is always best to be quite clear as to what one is about , he reminded himself . If this brings me to Wasselthorpe , then it means that he and I are linked at some level below the obvious . And I must deal with that reality , whatever it portends . He focused his mind , chanted five rising tones , then two descenders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air before him and he stepped through into a terrifying scene : the young man , clad again in his ancient Hero 's garb , sword in hand , stood beside the great white Wall that marked the limit of the human commons . At his feet was a scar in the virtual earth , a scar that must have been a large gash shortly before , because even as Bandar took note of it the wound was healing . But none of those sights were what frightened Bandar . Grouped around Wasselthorpe , close enough to touch , were several pure archetypes - the Hero , the Wise Man , the Father , Mother and Child , the Destroyer , the Fool , and more - a jostling crowd of characteristic entities , any one of which , at this range , should have drawn the young man 's consciousness into permanent , psychotic thralldom . Yet Wasselthorpe stood there , talking with them , uninsulated by thran , untouched by raw psychic power . Bandar immediately chanted the three , three and seven , seized Wasselthorpe by the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the first level of the Commons , where Bandar opened an emergency gate and brought them directly back to the waking world . Bandar felt a wave of dizziness come over him , but he fought it down and opened his eyes . Abbas was still kneeling over his student , methodically slapping his cheeks and calling upon him to come forth from whatever corner of his psyche he had tumbled into . Bandar reached down and restrained the fat man 's hand . " It 's all right , " he said , " I have brought him back . " Wasselthorpe was sitting up , putting a hand to his reddened cheek . When Abbas told him that he had been deep in coma , the young man said , " I was in the Commons of the Rovers . I entered Yaffak 's dream . " " That can not be so , " Bandar said . " They would have attacked you . " But even as he said it , he felt his innards chill and turn over . " I believe they perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter a friendly beast when we dream . " " Nonsense ! " Bandar said , though he knew it was not . " How could you get through the Wall ? It can not be breached . " " I went by way of the Old Sea . " Bandar vehemently denied Wasselthorpe 's assertion . " Only death awaits the consciousness that enters the utoposphere . It hangs there , incapable of motion , until the Worm comes to devour it . " But Wasselthorpe insisted . He said terrible things : that the archetypes had approached and had helped him , that they had given him power to cut through the floor of the Commons , swim through the gray nothingness then cut his way up into the Rover Commons . He had found Yaffak suffering , bound by some leash that went up into the sky . He had cut the tether with his Hero 's sword and the Rover had raced off , free and joyous . Then he had swum back through the sea , had even seen the Worm coming , but had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are lying ! " Bandar muttered through clenched teeth , even as a part of him said , He speaks the truth . Wasselthorpe casually-mentioned that , from the Rover 's side , the Wall appeared to be a hedge of black thorn bushes . Bandar wanted to clap his hands over his ears . That was a prime secret of the Institute , which no one outside its cloisters could know . Wasselthorpe burbled on : the Wise Man had shown the way ; he had used the Hero 's sword to cut a gash in the earth . Bandar knew it must be true ; he had seen the healing wound . The nonaut felt as if his head might burst . The Commons was governed by rules . Thousands of noonauts had died , and tens of thousands had suffered , to delineate those rules . Then along came Wasselthorpe to pull the foundation stones from beneath a hundred millennia of established procedure . And yet , some part of Bandar said , This is how it must be . The events of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts : Guth Bandar was bound to Phlevas Wasselthorpe , and together their fates were entwined with the history of the Dree . What any of this meant , he did not yet know , but when he had encountered the young man at the Wall , he had seen in his face the unmistakable expression of a Hero . And if the two of them were linked , Bandar must play the Helper . Yet Helpers frequently failed to survive the Hero 's catharsis . " I have more to tell , " Wasselthorpe said . " Well , you would , would n't you ? " Bandar snapped . " Spare me . " " I believe we must hear him , " Abbas said . " It might illuminate the events that happened while he was wandering in dreams . " " What happened ? " Wasselthorpe said . Abbas drew his attention to the absence of the Rover carts and their passengers and stewards . He briefly recounted Yaffak 's flight and the abandonment of their party . " The steward left us a weapon to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Bandar , " who seems to have gone insane . " " Yaffak will not do us harm , " Wasselthorpe said , rising to his feet . " I freed him from a hateful bondage . " He told again the tale of how he had sawed through the leash that tied the dreaming Rover and wanted Bandar to tell him its meaning . But Bandar was beyond answering questions . He wished he had never heard of Phlevas Wasselthorpe and his catalog of impossibilities , so innocently recounted . Bandar turned his back and looked away . But his outward composure belied his inner turmoil . Somewhere inside him a voice was speaking softly , telling him to be of help . He sought to close his mind against it . Abbas took charge . " We must pull the cart into the center of the clearing and get aboard . Right now we are an easy meal for any passing fand . " He summoned the chanters and FUx , now glowering ever more deeply , and they did as he directed . Once aboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone was competent in its use . Bandar was surprised when Wasselthorpe took the weapon , expertly stripped and reassembled it , then placed it under the seat for safety 's sake . The nonaut would not have thought that a provincial lordling , for all his interest in criminology , could have handled a weapon with such aplomb . In the close confines of the stationary cart , the passengers fell to squabbling . UIe Gazz wished all to chant ; she felt her chuffe swelling . Wasselthorpe rejected the concept of chuffe and sought to explore his alleged meeting with Yaffak in the Rover Commons , but Bandar refused to be drawn . Nor would he chant . His rebuff to Gazz caused her to disparage the relevance of the nosphere compared to the Lho-tso enlightenment . That caused Bandar to snap at her . Tempers were heating when Wasselthorpe suddenly made a startling announcement . " Chuffe is entirely an illusion , " he said . " Father Olwyn is in reality the notorious confidence trickster Horslan Gebbling , who will be taken into custody the moment my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this assertion with disdain , at which Wasselthorpe declared that he and Abbas were not what they appeared to be . Instead , they were undercover agents of the Bureau of Scrutiny , sent on the cruise to apprehend Gebbling . The others demanded proof . Wasselthorpe and Abbas dug within their clothing and produced official scroot plaques . Bandar squinted at each and learned that Wasselthorpe 's true name was Baro Harkless , while Abbas was named Luff Imbry . Both held the rank of agent-ordinary . Hence the fascination with criminal investigation , thought Bandar . Several more thoughts flitted rapidly through his mind , but the one he seized in passing was : " Your plaques allow you to call for assistance . " " We are ordered to remain incommunicado until we secure an arrest , " said Harkless/Wasselthorpe . His answer set off a new round of altercation that ended only when Flix spoke up from her corner seat to alert them to the imminent arrival of the Orgulon 's gig , flying in from the east . THE SIGHT of their rescue should have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glum sense of foreboding . His nonaut 's sensibilities were aroused and he felt as if he were not in the waking world but in a high-classification Event . Worse , it was that part of an Event 's cycle when the action begins to flow rapidly toward the climax . The gig dropped down , piloted by the landship 's first officer , whose name Bandar had not acquired . Beside him was Raina Haj . The vehicle settled at the edge of the clearing and the passengers rushed from the cart to greet it , the lassitude sufferers towed on their come-alongs . Flix came last , her hands clasped behind her back . Haj dismounted and lowered the aircraft 's rear gate while the first officer remained at the controls . Bandar saw Harkless ( he supposed he might as well adjust to the fellow 's name ) go to confer with the security officer , who seemed to be unimpressed with whatever the agent-ordinary told her . Haj waved the stranded party to board the gig . Something was moving out in the grass , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail of the queue . " Are we going back to the OrguJon ? " she asked . Haj said they were not . They would be taken to a temporary camp just beyond the immense stone plateau known as the Monument , where tents and tables were laid on for a luncheon . Father Olwyn was expected to appear and offer something called " the inculcation . " The Orgulon had been delivering equipment to the brilliun mines at nearby Victor and would rendezvous with the passengers by nightfall . FUx now advanced another agenda . She demanded to bypass the ceremony and be flown to Victor so she could arrange passage home . " That is not a matter for you to decide , " Haj told her . Again Flix differed , but instead of offering a fresh argument , she produced the energy pistol Harkless had left in the cart . She pointed it in an unsteady two-handed grip at Raina Haj . Now FUx looked to the first officer , who had remained in the gig 's operator 's seat . She addressed him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The man did as he was ordered , but the smirk on his face told Bandar that there was more of a relationship between him and the young woman than they had hitherto revealed . The officer came at Haj from the rear and reUeved her of her sidearm . Then he circled around the passengers to stand beside Flix , his pistol leveled at all and sundry . " Move away from the aircraft , " he told them . Raina Haj spoke up , addressing Flix . " This is not necessary , " she said . The first officer told her to shut up , but Haj spoke on , telling Flix , " I know you did n't kill him . " " I told you it was an accident , " Flix said . " No , not an accident , " Haj said . " Shut up , " the first officer repeated , aiming his weapon at Haj . Bandar saw his thumb extend toward the discharge stud , but Flix laid a hand on his arm and pushed it down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Haj . " Lies , " the man with the weapon said . But FUx wanted to hear what the security officer had to say . She moved off a couple of steps and now her energy weapon swung halfway from Haj to the other officer . The man did not delay a moment . A bright flash dazzled Bandar 's eyes and when his vision cleared Flix was face down on the grass , a smoking hole burned through her torso . Someone screamed and Bandar stared with both fascination and fright at the young woman 's corpse . It took him a long moment to recover his equilibrium . But the murderer had remained calm ; the energy pistol did not waver in his hand as he stepped back to give himself room should they try to rush him . Bandar was bemused to think that he had seen just such a look on the faces of villains many times in the Commons , though he had always done so from within the protection of a thran . " So you know , " the officer said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward her . " Well , then . " Now Harkless spoke up . " How are you going to explain it ? " Bandar could have predicted it . The Hero would always seek to engage the villain in talk , delaying the killing stroke while he worked out some tactic to save the day . But the man with the weapon barely glanced at Harkless , and instead spoke to Haj : he would blame the killings on the unstable Flix 's having gone berserk when the gig landed , even wounding him before he was able to seize Haj 's pistol and dispatch her . Bandar watched Harkless as the killer spoke . Some silent signal passed between the young agent and his plump partner . The undercover scroots were going to try something . Bandar felt a rising urge to help . He wanted to fight it , but found that his will to do so was fading . He gauged the distance between him and the man with the gun , wondering how fast his old legs would allow him to close the distance . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The officer was still keeping his eye on Haj , the known danger . Bandar realized that the killer must see Harkless as only a feckless young lordling , afflicted by the lassitude . This might work , he thought , then realized with an inner start that the opinion had come not from his usual inner critic , but from a new source : the Helper was rising in him . Bandar was struck by a sense of irreality , as if he were observing an Event or Situation in the nosphere . He saw again the Hero in the young agent 's stark expression and now it came to him the particular myth that featured a Hero in a wolf pelt and winged helmet : it told of a dawn-time Hero who , after defeating a man-devouring monster , dove deep into a frigid lake to confront the troll 's even more powerful mother . And in that lake , the Hero died . He is not the Hero Triumphant , Bandar thought . He is the Hero Sacrificial . His dynamic ends with his dying to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yaffak had not gone far , that the Rover was what they had seen moving in the grass as they brought the gig down , and was hearing and seeing all . Not bad , Bandar thought . Simple , believable . Enough to make the man stop and think . But when Harkless pointed to draw the officer 's attention , the man did not fall for the ruse . Bandar sighed . In real life , I suppose these things do n't work as well , he thought . He saw Harkless 's muscles tense for whatever he was going to try and readied himself to join in the rush . Harkless was at least partially in thrall to the Hero Sacrificial , but Bandar did not see in his aspect the look of one who expects to die . His face wore the assurance of one who intends to defeat an enemy , then march on to fresh challenges . The murderer showed the same confidence . But his conviction was fortified by his possession of an energy pistol and a demonstrated capacity to use it . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
