Cellophane By Marie Arana Random House Marie Arana part one A Plague of Tongues 1 Many years later , when the wise men gathered with their pierced faces and carved gourds to purify the streets of Floralinda , they agreed they should have known a run of plagues would curse this town . There had been signs , they muttered , sprinkling the hard earth with river water . There was the coughing dog . The blue-skinned boy . The little white terrier , Basadre , a normally mild , unexcitable creature , had spun through Don Victor Sobrevilla 's house whining and frenzied , chasing his tail in perfect circles . There was a madness to his movements -- out of control , yet full of grace -- a four-legged tango marked by perfect concatenations of the figure eight . The children laughed , following the dog through the corridors of the mansion , humming , spinning , somersaulting behind him , crashing against furniture until the air clattered with the sounds of the family silver . It began on the top floor of the house , when Basadre came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , strident little cry -- then twirled down the stairs to the second floor with its narrow passageways , cavernous bedrooms , and faded mirrors . The five children , age four to ten , sprang from their chairs , so delighted by the sight of the dancing dog that their teacher , Senorita Marcela , did n't have the heart to stopthem . They followed the animal , shrieking and bumping along walls so that lizards leapt out and scurried under the carpets in terror . By the time they reached the ground floor , they had chased the little dog over the black-and-white tiles of the foyer , in and out of the portrait-hung sala , around the vast mahogany table in the dining room , and stampeded toward the sacred sanctuary of their Aunt Belen 's library . The din from Don Victor 's grandchildren was so resounding that Boruba , the chief ama of the house , leaned out from the kitchen and with one earsplitting bellow --  " Callense ! "  - -  dispersed them and sent the ill-fated creature staggering out into the patio , where he sank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a cough such as no one in the Sobrevilla house had ever heard before -- dead-dry and brittle , like the rat-tat-tat of a dull hatchet against the trunk of a caoba tree . Basadre coughed and coughed , his white hair matted with sweat , his eyes flat as two desert stones . Don Victor emerged from his workshop , waving his arms and shouting that he could n't work with all the racket . " Que barbaridad ! " he cried . " Here I am putting the last touch of solder on the machine that will bring this misery of a lizard town to glory , and I have to listen to the endless hacking of a demon mutt ? " He held a goosenecked pincer in one hand , a ball of wire in the other , and it was clear that he had been in his workshop far too long , for he had that frazzled look -- thin hair sprouting skyward , cravat all askew . Dona Mariana swept downstairs when she heard her husband shouting on the patio . " I 'm coming , querido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders , as it always did during the hour of the siesta , and her dress was unhooked from underarm to hip . Struggling to tuck her ample bosom into place , she secured one or two hooks and called to Pedro the gardener to move the poor animal out of the sun and into a cool place under the potted cherimoya tree . Pedro had grown to love Basadre and wanted to make him more comfortable , but try as he might , he could n't lift the poor animal ; it was as if Basadre had attached himself to the floor , sent roots into the tilework . They all came after that : four generations of family members , one by one , registering their concern with varying degrees of dismay . The villagers , in clusters of two and three , came winding up the long path and peered over the brick barricade that had been erected to keep dangerous reptiles from slithering in when the mighty Ucayali overflowed its banks . A barricade without a dog was pointless , and the people of Floralinda knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor had purchased the terrier on a visit to Pucallpa twelve years before and named him after Jorge Basadre , Peru 's minister of roads , who had built the highway from Lima to Pucallpa . Just as Basadre , the man , had felt the call to open the Amazon to the world , Basadre , the dog , felt the call to keep it from spilling into his master 's house . He could sense a poisonous reptile before a human could , unearth nests of destructive soldier ants , smell wildmen as they moved swiftly along the rim of trees , waiting to raid the cornfields . The villagers filed past the sick animal , clucking their tongues . Basadre was small , but he had been fierce . Graciela was the first of Don Victor 's children to come out to the patio , lavishing the creature with all the attention she would have given her own son or daughter . She had pleaded with Boruba to bring the honey pot from the kitchen , crush the manzanilla flowers , fashion a little nozzle out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the tongue of the heaving dog . Graciela had grown into a magnificent woman , thirty-four years old , with grainy , dark circles that ringed her eyes and gave her a melancholy air that made young men sigh . La Bella Morada , the men at Chincho 's bar called her -- beautiful purple one -- and then they 'd hitch their trousers at the thought . She had been a lively child , and those embers still brightened her eyes , her walk , her rare moments of vivacity . There was no one in all of Floralinda who could sing and dance like Graciela . She had lived up to the promise of being a graceful child . When she donned the gold flamenco shoes her Tio Alejandro had sent from Trujillo , and when she stamped her long , thin feet the way she had been taught by the old gypsy Maruca , she could bring the whole Sobrevilla household streaming down the caoba stair , eager to see her move . Graciela lived in the mansion with only her two small children , Pablo and Silvia . La Bella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , vanishing into the Alto Amazonas like a cobra out of the hot sun . For a while , Nestor Sotomarino had been sighted nearby , in the company of renegade sailors . Some said he had become a rebel guerrillero ; others said he was getting rich on coca leaf ; but the last he had been seen was by the men down at Chincho 's bar , marching off alone with no more than a week 's supply of food on his back . Graciela was the delicately wired antenna of the Sobrevillas . It was she who tasted the sweetness of things to come , felt the ill winds , saw ghosts in the night air . It was she who , on the second day of Basadre 's ordeal , tenderly held his dry snout in her hands and realized the cough was no ordinary affliction . It was too otherworldly . Her father had been right to use the word demon . There was some witchery at work . Her older sister , Belen , too , knew that the dog 's malady signaled something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belen listened carefully and concluded that it was more complicated than a pulmonary spasm . She put down the book she was reading and began to scour her library shelves for something that would explain the phenomenon . She stood on her toes , stretched a long neck toward her wall of books , and wrinkled her freckled nose . But she could n't find it . She remembered , however , in lightning concordance between learning and tenderness , a scene from Alexandre Dumas 's La Dame aux Camellias , in which the heroine 's cough is soothed by poetry . Snatching a volume of sonnets by Dante , Belen strode resolutely to the patio , knelt before the animal , and began reading aloud . " I greet you in Love 's name , hoping you will escape that pain so great even the farthest stars flinch , that even the sky drains itself of planet , moon , cloud , as if the end of the world marched on us , as if what I 'm about to say were the words that set ablaze each soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The dog gasped and held his breath , leading her to conclude what she 'd always suspected , that words could fix everything -- she had only to read to the end of the volume to cure their beloved Basadre . But by the third line of the stanza , he was hacking again , with a frenzy that brought tears to her eyes . If her sister , Graciela , had inherited her mother 's heart with something more -- a healthy regard for the supernatural -- Belen had inherited her father 's head with something less -- a staunch rejection of jungle sorcery . No matter how often Don Victor told Belen about the witchman , the stone , and her triumphant entry into the world , she refused to think of it as anything but a coincidence . Had she borne children of her own she might have allowed that reproduction was in itself miraculous and that there was scant difference between the roles that a prayer or a stone might play in it . But at the age of thirty-six , she was childless and logical . She regarded rain forest cures as primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits to his feathered shamans . She kept journals , sewn from her father 's paper , in which she wrote lists upon lists of random information : the botanical name of each new plant she encountered ; amusing aphorisms ; foreign words gleaned from books , and their definitions ; the title of every novel she had read and its most memorable character . Her library was a model of organization , every volume in place according to subject and nationality of the author . Her father had built the room twenty years before , when she was only sixteen , worried that his bookish daughter would be lured by his old aunt 's standing invitation to come live in Trujillo . He oversaw its construction with infinite care , ordering shelves cut from dense mahogany , seeing that the urucu was applied evenly and burnished to a deep red glow . At first , there had n't been much to shelve , but Don Victor made sure every bagmaker in Pucallpa and every printer in Iquitos knew that he expected books as part of the payment . " Literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their barges drifted off into black water . " You bring it , you hear me ? Bring me Cervantes ! Ricardo Palma ! El Inca Garcilaso de la Vega ! Do n't bring me dogshit . I 'll charge you more if you do ! " First came the printed matter no one wanted to read -- census reports from the military , discarded lesson books , socialist pamphlets about working conditions in Arequipa . But eventually , the collection grew to a laudable diversity : manuals on the navigable waters of the Amazon , dictionaries translating Spanish into a dozen languages , Turgenev 's letters , Blake 's poetry reinterpreted by Neruda , Jose Marti 's recollections of Manhattan , all of Chekhov 's plays . Within twenty years , the room housed thousands of volumes . Belen had read them all -- some , a number of times -- and although she had not chosen to avail herself of the Trujillo invitation , her great-aunt , Tia Esther , had been her library 's most beneficent donor , sending books through Tio Alejandro 's regular shipments from the coast . And so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to furnish Belen 's imagination . If it was n't with weekly letters written in a bold hand , relaying the news of the day in her bustling city , it was in books , bought at estate auctions by the cartons , inscribed with tender dedications to her grandniece . There was no question : Books were Belen 's faith , her foil against the wilderness . She loved drawing each one from its shelf , handling its spine , dusting away the mites that had been brought to her library from God knew where . She loved that split-second transcendence when reading would carry her off to a realm in which truth reigned , mysteries were explained , and paths unfurled before her -- shining and absolute . Reading had made her serious and learned . No , she could not believe a witchman and his stones could make a difference between life and death . Looking down now at Basadre in his misery , Belen wished she could have faith in myths and magic . Hard evidence told her the dog would die . Elsa , Jaime 's wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the ailing animal . In mid-morning , after Jaime had departed on one of his weekly trips upriver , she came down , an ivory mantilla hugging her shoulders and a scowl twisting her face . She stood in the frame of the house 's carved portals , a good distance from the hacking dog , and yelled , " Stop it , you flea-ridden beast ! You 're driving me crazy ! " But crazy she already was , and the whole household knew it . Elsa was a parched bird of a woman , as arid as the dunes of Chan Chan . She had come to live with them after her marriage to Jaime in Trujillo , where he had been sent to attend school . She arrived in Floralinda with a pedigree that proved totally useless in the jungle . Elsa was a Marquez y Marquez , the daughter of the powerful sugar baron whose vast cane fields rimmed the Pacific , between Trujillo and Chiclayo . The Marquezes had built palaces along Peru 's rugged shoreline , dug an empire into the desert , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growing appetite for sugar in America , the family had sent their agents into the highlands to lend money to the poor freely , but months later they would return to collect what was owed them : in trucks , with whips and shackles , forcing debtors into the cane fields . Elsa had been raised wanting nothing . She wore clothes her father had imported from Paris . She boasted about her education from a French tutor who had been brought all the way from St. Cyr . She was imperious , frigid , self-absorbed . No one in Floralinda could imagine why Jaime had fallen in love with her . She had n't always been that way . When Jaime had first met her , she was a clever young woman with a pretty face , a lovely figure , and a socialite 's taste for frivolity . The face and figure did n't change . But Elsa 's condition had erupted shortly after her arrival in the jungle : a psychosis so acute that Jaime awoke one night to find her shaking uncontrollably . Having been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack of Taki Onqoy , an invasion of microscopic worms that travel the bloodstream , lodge in the brain , and cause convulsions . It was a curse -- well known -- that jungle Indians inflicted on trespassers . Continues ...
