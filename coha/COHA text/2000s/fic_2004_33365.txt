Maria Has a Child It 's a half-empty early morning flight from Oakland into Midway and the sun is coming up , lighting the plane like the inside of an eyelid . The stewardess asks in a whisper if I would like another coffee and I say OK and she sets it on the tray with a white napkin and a small bag of cheese- flavored pretzels , which I stuff in the pouch with the others . I reach over my head and turn the light off . The plane is glowing , there 's so much sun outside . I 'm in the back and I have all three seats . I have n't been in Chicago in six years and I 've only been on a plane three times in my life . I don t like to fly . There 's a giant sound like a bird has been sucked into one of the jets and the seatbelt light flashes on . I grip the armrests as the plane shakes violently twice then continues its course . The pilot does n't say anything over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn and see the stewardess in the dark back cabin , sitting in a triangle of light , on a platform against a series of metal cases , reading a magazine , the belt across her lap unfastened . I have blisters on both hands where my girlfriend , Ambellina , burned me with a cigarette when I told her I was going to Chicago for the weekend . I brought just a small bag with me , a change of clothes , a notebook , and an alarm clock . I 'm traveling light . Chicago has changed . Midway is a big airport now and there 's a train that rides all the way to downtown . Hallways as long as boulevards lead to a food court offering soaked beef sandwiches and Vienna hot dogs . The new Mayor Daley welcomes me home , his face plastered across a billboard in front of the train station . I want to climb the scaffolding andkiss him and tell him I 'm glad to be back here , even for just a little while . There 's a look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicagoans prefer their politicians crooked and I can understand why . Whatever he has to do , he looks like the guy for the job . At the Loyola train stop I board the Devon bus and pass Clark Street , where the diners are still painted like Indian casinos , tomahawks and dollar signs over plates full of fried eggs and chili fries . The bus passes Carrie 's , which I did n't expect to still be there , but it is , an Irish bar in the middle of a Muslim neighborhood . Then Western Avenue , Hobby Models now a luggage store , the Nortown theater replaced with a Pakistani assembly hall . Little India , traffic pauses . I lay my head against the glass , and the slow rocking of the bus nearly puts me to sleep . Shirnee bob in pans full of syrup in the windows . I get off the bus to walk . Almost immediately the strap of my bag whips tight against my neck . " Do n't I know you , motherfucker ? " I turn to face a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head like an anvil with a bald stripe running down the center of it , a necklace of tattoos partially obscured by the collar of his denim jacket . His clothes are torn and his face smeared in acne and weeping sores . " I do n't think so . " " Give me a dollar . " We stand for a second . His nose is like a bull 's and pulses while he breathes . His lips peel back to reveal cracked brown teeth and spangled gums . He balls his fists and releases a low growl . The foot traffic continues around us as if nothing is happening . This is where I grew up . " I 'm just kidding , " he says , his cracked lips retreating into a smile . " You do n't know me , man . Do n't look so scared . " And he turns and walks away , the dirty frays on the bottom of his jeans brushing the sidewalk . After California Avenue the bright colors are gone and things get quieter . Three Orthodox Jews stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and swaying beneath the chipped wooden sign of a star and sickle . Thillen 's Stadium is still there , where the Little Leaguers play next to the canal . Brown 's Chicken has been replaced by Fried USA . There 's the Lincoln Bridge , which I wo n't cross , but on the other side of the bridge is Lincoln Village and Shadows Nightclub , its sign divided into great black wings spread against the facade . I wo n't go over there . I can see from where I 'm standing that they 've built new movie theaters and a car wash . The old mall has been scrubbed and painted into a shiny metropolis and it hides the cheap motels on the other side of it . The bridge is city limits . After the bridge you 're not in Chicago anymore . I knock on apartment No. 10 on the third floor of a three-story rail flat . All of the apartments share a long cement porch and the view is of a closed-down gas station and a deli . One of the apartments has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its door , another a bicycle frame with no wheels . At the end of the porch a man is having a cigarette ; he does n't look at me when I knock . A woman comes outside , her head wrapped in a scarf and says something to the man but he keeps his back to her and she goes back inside . He pitches his cigarette out to the gutter and takes a pouch of tobacco from his pocket and slowly rolls another one . " Well , " Maria says when she answered the door , a little at first and then all the way , a baby cradled in her arm . She laughs , then I laugh . God she 's beautiful . She steps out to the porch and the man on the end turns to regard her . The child stretches its arms and squeezes its tiny fists as if waking from a nap . I look past her to see if the apartment is empty . Then her face , which has n't changed much , long and oval like an egg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she has curves I can make out even beneath her baggy clothes . She 's wearing a striped shirt , two buttons open , and blue jeans . She 's wearing them in a comfortable way , bunched all the way to her ankles and low on her hips , like she does n't care how they look . Her dark cheeks almost pink but she is n't wearing any makeup . I was n't expecting her to have a baby . The baby changes everything . " You show up at the oddest times , " she says , which makes me smile even more , thinking about the last time , ten years ago , when her boyfriend threw me out of a bar . " It 's only three o'clock , " I say , wondering how it took so long to get here . " Very funny , Dumbo . You know what I mean . " We 're seated at her kitchen table drinking tea . The baby 's name is Kyle . It 's a small one- bedroom apartment , like a studio with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I used to live in . There 's an enormous box of corn flakes above the fridge , three pans of different sizes dangling over the stove . She has a couch , a small stereo shaped like a jukebox , some toys on the floor , and one entire wall filled with paperback books . " What happened to your hands ? " Maria asks . The blisters are the size of pencil erasers . I had forgotten my burns . I think she would understand if I told her . Ambellina was jealous ; she gets that way . I look down at the muscles between my thumbs and index fingers , push my thumbs against my fingers . Ambellina did n't want me to go but I told her I had to so she pulled my hand toward her , locking my elbow between her knees , pushing my palm into her leg . I said no and she said yes , pressing the cigarette into the back of my wrist , making a sound like the sizzle of an opium pipe . I screamed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon grease , " I tell Maria . " It 's nothing . " " Both hands ? " " I know . " " I do n't know , " she says , patting her child . She lives here alone . There 's no evidence of anyone else in this apartment , a small dish of baby food perched on the edge of the sink . The runners are tan and the paint is chipped , revealing an older layer of blue paint beneath it . When I first met Maria we were fifteen and both living in state homes for wards of the court . All the boys were playing basketball when the van from the girls ' home arrived . She was just admitted , wearing all pink : pink shoes , pink earrings , pink shorts and shirt . She looked like an unopened piece of candy . She was shy and stared but I knew something horrible had happened to her because girls do n't often end up in group homes . We made a lot of promises then , about staying together and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promises , about protecting her and keeping her safe . " Do n't look at me like that , " she says , reaching to the counter for the bottle . " Sorry . " She has an arm around Kyle 's waist , her head titled toward the baby 's crown . Kyle has his little hands on the bottle . " He 's like a little person , " I say . " Except he knows what he wants . " I stare at the baby , a pile of creases between rings of fat . His skin is the color of eggnog ; he has enormous ears . I notice Maria is n't wearing any rings but that does n't mean anything . I can see the top of her bra where her shirt is unbuttoned . I was married once , before Ambellina . Ambellina has children I 've never met . A girl and a boy . But sometimes just a girl . Ambellina 's story changes from time to time . I 'm sure she has a daughter , because the girl comes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from grammar school to high school in the time I 've been with her . Kyle has little brown hairs , curly and soft , different from Maria 's black hair , which has always been straight and dry . The two of them are smiling . I wonder how much time she spends here , speaking with her baby , and if she talks to anyone else . She turns the child around so he faces me , his fat little belly hanging over his diapers , his mouth open , waiting for some more good news , the bridge of her hands under his arms . The baby is directly between us . I lean back in my chair , fingers on the cup handle . I thought Maria would be alone or she would be married but I did n't expect this . Two smiling faces . The pale baby , his mouth the shape of a firecracker with a wick on both ends . Maria , her dark cheeks flushed . That could have been our child . He 's not even a year old . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she wanted . " Tell me something , " Maria says . " I live in San Francisco now . Every day it 's the same temperature . My girlfriend did n't want me to come here . " " Maybe you should have listened to her , " Maria says . " I 'm just teasing . You want some more tea ? " " Sure . It 's good tea . " " Hold on a second . Let me get this pot going again . And let me change this little guy . " Maria keeps Kyle against her as she reaches over the stove light . Maria used to be skinny . She used to starve herself . There 's a couple of clicks as the flame pops beneath the kettle . She leans her hip into the cabinet and lays Kyle on top of a towel on the counter , pulls the pin out of his diaper . Kyle kicks his legs like he 's riding a bicycle . " This is n't a bad place , " I say . " Bigger than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes through the window from the exhaust . There 's a factory across the street where they make fancy chocolates but you would n't know it looking at the sidewalks at night . I 'm thinking about moving somewhere nicer . " I scratch my head . " Hand me one , " she says , lifting Kyle , pointing to a box . I get up and grab her a diaper and then sit back down . The old diaper goes in a sack held with two rods . She wipes Kyle and fastens the new diaper around his legs . " How about you ? " About me ? " Maria begins . " I still live in Chicago . " " Ha ha . " " Well , there was Joe . That 's most of it . You met him . " " I did . I met him the hard way . " " Everybody met Joe the hard way . " I bring the cup back to my lips before realizing it 's empty . " Hey , I 'm sorry . I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your hands . " " I ca n't even tell you . I loved him the most . " I feel something drop and put the cup down harder than I mean to . I do n't think I ever doubted for a day that I loved Maria the most . My wife knew that . She could sense it . I love Ambellina too , but it 's different . On my last day in the group home , Maria and I were in the smoking room waiting for the car that was going to take me to a place called Prairie View . I was almost seventeen and I would have done anything for Maria . My hand was inside her shirt , fiddling with the bottom of her bra , feeling the weight of her breasts . She slid her leg over my legs and then to the other side of me and I was top of her on the couch . We were waiting for that car and it felt like we had all the time in the world but we used it as best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard us or not . But no one came to the door . " Do n't look at me that way either , " she says . " You look like a wolf . " Kyle starts to cry . I turn away for a second . It 's an awful sound . The kettle is ringing and the room is filling with steams . Maria reaches over and shuts the stove off , the pot rattling across the burner . " Let 's give the baby some attention , " she says . " Let 's all look at the baby . Who 's the baby ? Are you the baby ? Everybody loves the baby . Everybody listens to the baby when the baby cries . " She 's bouncing Kyle and soon Kyle is happy again . It seems so easy . Maria pours tea into my cup . She 's still holding Kyle with one arm . The cup full , she keeps the pot near to my hand . " I 've had burns like those , " she says . " They 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wrist . Then , as they heal , they 'll leave pale round marks . I have eight of them on my right thigh . Starting on my knee and finishing at my waist . They 're like buttons . I stare at her middle , try to imagine her new scars beneath her clothes . " What are we talking about. ? " " I was telling you my story . " I hide my hands in my lap for a moment until she looks away . " How did you find me , by the way ? " she asks , placing the kettle back on the stove and taking her seat across from me but holding Kyle so his face is just about the table , his tiny hands gripping the edge . " I see you , " I say to Kyle . He grins at me . " People are n't that hard to find . You can find anybody now for fifty dollars . You were telling me about Joe . " " Yes , Joe . I lived with Joe for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I think . That some people , they get what they want , it just makes them want you more . He was a violent person . " " That 's one way of putting it . " " He never hurt me too much . " " How would you know ? " " Do n't joke . They gave him fifty years . " She 's quiet for a second and the baby is still . In the silence I hear voices coming from the wall . It 's her neighbors having a conversation about soup . She smiles awkwardly when she realizes what I 'm listening to . " He had two strikes already for some other things . He strangled a man outside the Oak Club . I saw him do it . They had said something to each other . Joe was the bouncer . I never got the full story . Everybody has a different view of the situation . Sometimes Joe would kick somebody out just to have a fight . " She takes Kyle in both hands again and bounces him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby . He yells and claps . I wait for her to continue while she pulls Kyle toward her and he stretches his arm out and she takes his fist in her mouth . Then she opens her mouth and he takes his arm back . She turns in her chair and crosses her legs . " You 're spoiling him , " I say . " That 's OK . One of us needs to be spoiled . Makes up for the cheap diapers . Anyway , this guy . You know I would let Joe do anything he wanted . I wanted him to do whatever he wanted to me . I tried to cover the bruises with makeup . My caseworkers wanted to put me in a woman 's shelter to get me away with him , so I stopped meeting with her and lost my SSI . I did n't care what she thought . But he needed more . Hence the bacon grease . " Maria reaches across the table to touch the blisters near my fingers . They 're raised and yellow with pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " She touches the blister carefully . " Joe wanted to hurt people ; he could n't help it . " I can feel the bubble of liquid move just a little bit under pressure . Her finger glides along the top of the blister . " He would pierce me with things . He carved his name into my back with a scalpel and covered it with baking soda so it would n't heal . I could show you . " She waits for an answer . " No . I 'm not interested . " " Fine . People do n't think that 's love . But listen , this is important . If you pop these you have to cover them with Bacitracin and a Band-Aid . You have to watch out for infection . But you should n't pop them . They 'll heal better if you do n't . " I nod my head . " Promise me . " " Sure . " " Liar . " Maria continues to look at the blisters . " OK . Joe is standing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the guy is turning blue . And people are pulling on Joe 's arms , trying to get him to let go . But Joe worked out six days a week . He only ate red meat . One guy was literally hanging from Joe 's arm with his full weight . But nobody could get him to let go . He still had the guy 's neck when the police came . There were three cars surrounding Joe . I thought they were going to bulldoze him into the bar . Those police , with their guns , you could tell they were scared . " " A badge does n't change that . " " I would n't testify and they threatened to lock me up for contempt of court . They came around here . They said they had a warrant but I did n't ask to see it and the only place they searched was the refrigerator . They did n't need me -- -there were dozens of witnesses . Finally they left me alone . " I wonder how she pays the rent here . Maria took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hundred dollars , but she left her clothes , and the apartment continued to smell like her for the long time . This is a small apartment to have a child in -- -a little front room , the kitchen part of the living room , a television set with a towel over the front of it . A cable sticking out of the wall not connected to anything . Hundreds of paperback books , the kind you get in a grocery store . A bedroom I can see from here , just big enough for a pine bed and a dresser . But there 's no crib . She must sleep with Kyle , so if he wakes up crying she 's there right behind him , her breasts and her stomach . I bet he goes right back to sleep . I bet he has no idea how small the apartment is that he 's living in because she does n't let him know . " He 's not Joe 's child , is he ? " " No . He 's not . He 's only my child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a little while . Not just yet . "
