<p> The most bitter scientific debates usually play out in little-read academic and specialty journals . But the dispute over the lingering health risks of radioactive bullets fired by the US in the Balkans is sparking demands for answers from leaders across Europe . The recent deaths and illnesses of European peacekeepers who served in the region are deepening already strained ties between the US and its NATO allies . The surge in interest in the 1999 Kosovo bombing campaign is also causing experts to turn for clues to another former allied target : Iraq . At issue are the armor-piercing depleted-uranium ( DU ) bullets fired by American aircraft in Kosovo and Bosnia . Far greater numbers were fired in Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War , however , littering the desert war zone with radioactive debris . Battlefield conditions , likelihood of exposure , and apparent health effects differ widely between the Balkans and Iraq . Experts say a close comparison raises questions about whether DU could be the main culprit in Kosovo . " This is the moment to find out the scientific truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's DU Assessment Team in the former Yugoslavia and a former Finnish environment minister . His team has found elevated levels of radiation at eight out of 11 sites it examined in Kosovo . " I 'm not so happy we have Kosovo as a test laboratory , but the valuable thing is that for the first time we are doing field work with this issue , " he says . In Iraq , more DU was used , and soldiers were often far more exposed during combat , notes Mr. Haavisto . Contaminated areas in Kosovo , however , are " local and limited , " and NATO ground troops did not deploy until the bombing stopped . " When speaking about these severe health effects , I am a little bit doubtful whether a short time serving in Kosovo could affect your health in such a serious way , " he says . Strain among allies Britain , America 's closest ally during the Kosovo campaign , on Tuesday became the latest European nation to begin testing soldiers for so-called " Balkans Syndrome . " NATO chiefs rejected Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome announced it was investigating the cancer-related deaths of seven of its Balkan veterans . DU is a low-level nuclear waste left over from the making of nuclear energy and bombs . It is a dense , and therefore formidable , armor-piercing weapon . But the toxic heavy metal burns on impact and creates clouds of radioactive dust that some scientists say can be dangerous if breathed or eaten . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright - echoing the Pentagon 's view - stated Tuesday that there is " no scientific basis " to link DU with the string of cancer deaths and related illnesses reported in Europe . US and NATO military-training manuals require wearing protective gear within 50 yards of any known DU-contaminated vehicle , to avoid contact with the dust . Several American vehicles struck with DU during Gulf War " friendly-fire " incidents were deemed to present a " substantial health risk " at the time , and were buried in low-level radioactive waste dumps . Citing " militarily sensitive information , " NATO withheld details of exact impact sites in Kosovo until last summer . The delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or marking sites to alert civilians . US Defense Secretary William Cohen on Tuesday dismissed NATO member concerns . " Adequate warnings were given " by Washington , he said , and " there is a " very low risk ... provided there is sufficient protection . " But a " hazard awareness " document about DU issued by the Pentagon 's joint chiefs soon after the Kosovo conflict , circulated to allied capitals and acquired this week by The New York Times , made no mention of the radiation risks of DU . In Brussels yesterday , NATO Secretary-General George Robertson promised a new openness to reassure people that " the weapons that were used have not caused any lasting damage to the area , or to the people of the area , or to the troops who are peacekeeping in the whole region . " Gulf War use US troops fired 340 tons of DU in the Gulf War - 783,000 bullets and 9,000 larger tank rounds , by the Pentagon 's count . Though the Gulf battlefield was a toxic stew that included dangerous chemicals and other toxins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spate of cancers , birth defects , and other severe health problems . US and Iraqi veterans alike describe a combat zone thick with DU-laden smoke , as Iraqi tanks were picked off by American gunners . Advancing allied forces passed contaminated burning vehicles ; thousands of soldiers took after-action tours of the front line , and climbed - unprotected - on destroyed Iraqi tanks bathed with the telltale black DU dust . Today , 1 in 7 US vets claims a collection of ailments known as Gulf War Illness , though Pentagon studies dismiss DU as a cause . Critics charge that many veterans have died as a result . Iraq says its Gulf War vets have abnormally high rates of cancer , similar to current European claims . US officials counter that 33 American survivors of " friendly fire " DU attacks in an ongoing monitoring program exhibit few signs of cancers now reported in Europe . Only a fraction of the amount of DU fired in Iraq has been used in the Balkans : nine tons in Kosovo , and three tons in Bosnia in 1994 and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , as allies targeted petroleum and chemical industries . US pilots fired DU into populated towns for the first time in Kosovo , but barely a handful of destroyed Yugoslav Army vehicles were found in the Serb province by NATO troops . Many DU bullets missed their target or hit non-metal decoys , and therefore would not have turned to dangerous dust . " They would be in the ground , and it would be a very slow process to break it down chemically , and move it around , " says Leonard Dietz , a radiation expert who worked for 25 years at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in the US . In 1979 , he found that DU particles had been carried 26 miles by the wind . Different exposure , terrain Windblown Iraq is still spread with DU particles , which lose half their radioactivity every 4.5 billion years . But regular rain in Kosovo - and a geography of forests and hills - cut down the spread of DU particles . " My hunch is that whatever is ailing all these veterans is not totally due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you can blame it all on one source . " " The trouble is that you 've got to have numbers , and nobody has done any decent epidemiology on DU , " says Chris Busby , a low-level radiation specialist who has examined leukemia clusters for the Irish government , for a research body called Green Audit . " In this game , everybody waves their arms around , but there are no numbers at all , " he says . " Give me numbers , and I 'll give you an answer , " he says . Mr. Busby visited the Iraqi battlefield three months ago at the request of an Arab television network . His soil samples showed less radioactivity than he expected , and were confiscated by Iraqi authorities . But a series of air samples he took indicated that radiation levels - from DU dust that emits powerful alpha radiation - were 20 times higher in battle areas than in Baghdad . Likewise , during the Kosovo campaign , scientists in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , to the south , detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Underestimated ' impact In a paper he presented to the Royal Society of Britain 's DU working group last year , Busby spelled out how he believes the health impact of low-level radiation has been underestimated . A close analogy with DU , he says , is someone warming themselves by a fire receiving a " dose " of heat . " If you reach into the fire and eat a hot coal , you would still have the same overall ' dose , ' but it would burn a hole in your stomach . " That would square with a 1991 DU report commissioned by the US Defense Department , which warned that " no dose is so low that the probability of effect is zero . " In Kosovo , UN investigators say they want to take no chances . " Of course we can be critical that this information was not released by NATO in the summer of 1999 , for the local population and Kosovo Force soldiers , " says the UN 's Haavisto .
