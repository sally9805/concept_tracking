When Father John Cusick got the opportunity to direct young adult ministry for the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1977 , he asked , " What 's that ? " Cusick fought against attaching the term single , and he won . " The church does n't run a dating service , " he says . " We run an outreach to generations of people who are becoming less and less connected . " It was only 40 years ago , Cusick points out , that young adults were the backbone of Catholic parishes and the lay movements that energized the church prior to Vatican II . Fast forward to today , and those same people are still ministering in parishes : " The older people just wo n't let go , and younger people are still seen as kids , " he says . Founder of the popular Theology on Tap program and author of The Basic Guide to Young Adult Ministry ( Orbis , 2001 ) with Katherine DeVries , Cusick has spent years listening to young adult Catholics . It should n't be that hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all starts with a few basic principles , among them , " Let 's be nice to people . I do n't think that 's too hard . " The editors interview Father John Cusick What would a typical Catholic young adult minister hear from young people today ? For young adults the primary thing is always going to be relationships , whether they 're single or married . Second are issues of spirituality and spiritual identity , then personal development and work . Twenty-somethings are very cynical as far as the workplace goes . The spiritual hunger in America is being driven by bad news from the workplace on two fronts . Many young adults are watching a fifty-something parent get wiped out of a job . And for themselves , it 's last one hired , first one fired . I ca n't tell you the number of people who come and talk to me about going into the not-for-profit world . Why ? Because the profit world is not feeding them . One must approach this generation not with theology but with spirituality . When young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me how this stuff relates to my daily life . " Why are we having less success reaching young people than the evangelical churches ? The evangelical churches have made young adults a priority . The Catholic Church has made systems a priority . People come second for us . What do you mean ? A woman said to me one day , " My parish resembles a private religious country club . " Why ? " It 's easy : Take out a membership , pay your dues , and you get perks . " What are the perks ? " The sacraments , " she said . " They 'll marry you , baptize your kids , and bury you . But you have to belong . " When young people show up to get married , the first question they 're asked in most parishes is , " Are you registered ? " Not " Are you Catholic ? " or " Are you in love ? " The lack of the presence of young adults in the church is the elephant in the living room that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find enough people to keep everything going . But who are those people ? Usually in a parish there are two groups : senior citizens and families with school-age children . Young people are looking to be part of something . The tragedy I see is that sometimes they 're not involved not because they do n't want to be , but because the system is against them . How so ? Take scheduling . Many parishes schedule eucharistic ministers and lectors for three months ahead . Now imagine a 28-year-old couple with two kids-you mean to tell me that in the middle of February they 're going to know what they 'll be doing at the end of May ? They just do n't sign up . How many younger people who are not parents are catechists ? Very few . Why ? How many younger people will want to commit to something every Saturday morning from September to May ? How do you get around it ? Simple-you create a catechetical team for each class of kids , with a master catechist and a few younger people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the scandals that are pushing young people away , but it 's the system . But surely some young adults have other issues with the church . Until you find a place to call home , you can get very angry at Catholic ideology . However , you can live with this if you have a parish connection , even though the ideology is still in place . Take , for example , the creative Catholic people who come to Old St. Pat 's in Chicago and yet disagree with certain of the Catholic Church 's positions . But they 've found a place to pray , a place to call home , a place to share life and concerns with others . It 's pretty hard today to find anyone young who does not know somebody who is gay . Much of Catholic teaching on that issue does n't sink in for them . Will some people walk away because of positions like this ? Yes , but my contention is that the spiritual hunger does n't go away . If we can offer people graciousness , perhaps when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a single-issue church . Are n't many young people suspicious of institutions in general ? Yes , but you still have to give people the best experience of the church that you can . I am the institutional church for many young adults . I ca n't pooh-pooh the institutional church , nor do I want to . I have to present its best side . It 's working . We have an overflow Mass at 11:15 on Sunday . The proof to me is in the people . What needs to happen for it to work ? The virtue of the new millennium is hospitality . Hospitality means you 're not judged first ; instead you 're welcomed first . That 's the key . One phrase that I have worked from is " Do nothing to add to the sorrow of a funeral or to take away the joy of a wedding . " That 's hospitality . What else have you learned ? Young adults are more Catholic than they think they are . Catholicism to me is a blood type , not a religion of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion , about 18 percent . That said , it 's also true that every subsequent group of twenty-somethings is more secular than the group that went before them . The difficulty of the culture as I see it is secularity . A pastor , burying his third teenage suicide victim in one summer , said to me , " What kind of culture is it that allows its children to take their values from television ? " Does it bother you that young adults do n't know much about Catholic tradition ? No , what bothers me is that the church is saying they do n't , but is doing very little about it . One principle I use is , " Presume little , explain lots . " I 'd love to see in the back of every church a brochure with pictures explaining every religious symbol there : the altar , the sanctuary lamp , everything . We are a religion of symbol and ritual , and yet we have whole generations who do n't understand the symbols . Instead of critiquing these generations with a cocktail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young adults care what an altar or the sanctuary lamp is ? If they had it explained properly , they 'd have to care . I do not do a Baptism , for example , without taking time before the ritual to explain water , oil , light , and why we 're asking , " What name have you chosen for your child ? " when they 've been calling the kid the same name for six months already . Knowledge is power . You ca n't keep people in the dark . We have to be teachers of the faith not just executioners of a ritual . What do young adults ask you ? Young adults will come and say , " Father , why do I have to go to Confession ? " That 's a good question , but it is a religious question . Religious questions are never life questions . Religion is a response to life . So what are the life questions here ? On Confession the first is , " How do you get free ? " and the second is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us has baggage . And we have to learn to negotiate our baggage , or our baggage is going to possess us . The fifth step in Alcoholics Anonymous is essentially confession . If it 's good enough to stay sober , should n't it be good enough to remain faithful ? So I line up all the vehicles to get free that the Catholic Church provides . At the beginning of each Mass , for example , we call to mind our sins : Get the baggage out of the way . If you lay it out in response to the human questions , people will listen . What other life questions are young adults wondering about ? " Father , do you mean to tell me that Jesus is jammed into that little piece of bread ? Come on , off the record , Father .... " But here 's the real question : " In a world where you can have anything you want , what do you really need ? " If you have a credit card in your pocket with a $54,000 line of credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to . What do you really need ? The bread of life-the Body of Christ . Young adults ask constantly , " Will I be married ? " The real question is , " Will I be loved ? " Nobody has the right to be married , but everybody has the right to be loved . If you can get people to ask the right questions , they can see how our religion lays out a vision . What I had to learn over the years is that I 'm in marketing and sales . I have to listen to the target group , see how it lives , and then provide and explain the Catholic tradition as experientially as I can . I 'm sort of a walking catechism . So we need well-trained priests ? This is not the realm of the ordained . This is about well-trained leadership . Can the people running Baptism programs understand that they ca n't be Attila the Hun when a young couple comes in and ca n't make the baptismal prep class ? We must put the burden of church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always telling people to come to us when it 's convenient for us . If they ca n't make it , do we go out to them ? Think what an attitude change that would be . It 's marketing and sales . One of the great marketers in the Western world was John Paul II . Or look at Mother Teresa . Who cared about her theology ? She embraced the human condition . That 's what won the day . The issue today in the church is how do you become mission-driven instead of member-driven . But how do you find young adults who are not plugged into the church ? Word of mouth . Plus , new people come to church every Sunday . Every time I preach , I talk to the stranger , the person who 's there for the first time . That changes my language . It makes me mission-driven in my preaching rather than member-driven . People say , " In our parish we see the same people all the time . " No , you do n't . With active Catholic practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there all the time . At weddings and funerals you see all kinds of unchurched people . I had a wedding where there had to be 10 crossdressers . My goal for the day was to speak to them , because I believe they are God 's children , not freaks . One of them came up afterwards and said , " Thanks . " They listened , because I spoke to the stranger . With all that we spend on religious ed for children , why is n't that producing more committed young adults ? We do not have a seamless way of staying in touch with people . There 's not one diocese in this country that has a pastoral plan for Catholic young people from adolescence to adulthood . One young man described it as " living in a time between the sacraments " - between Confirmation and marriage . That time is spreading out wider than ever , and young people are less connected . If that second sacramental moment comes , they will not necessarily head back to the church . Second , an increasing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts us at a great disadvantage . Thirty-two percent of marrying Catholics eligible to be married in the church are marrying outside the tradition . Of that same group , 90 percent are saying they will have their children baptized in church . So the place of marriage is becoming less important , but passing on the faith to the next generation is still very important . What do you say to parents who are grieving that their young adult kids do n't go to church ? Sunday Mass is now an option-one of many . If you ask these young people , " Would you go to Mass ? " they would probably say , " Under the right conditions , yes , I will because I 'm Catholic . " Would they go with the regularity of their parents ? Probably not . As a church we have to see that they are not the enemy : They are our children . I 'd say to parents : You have to invite young people to break bread with you at a Catholic experience that is life-giving for them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent involved in my parish , I 'd lobby like mad to pass on the torch of ministry to the next generation . I spoke at a parish last year and I said , " I want you to find your own replacement . And it must be a person 40 or younger . " Is n't that unrealistic ? Not at all . I call it a " preferential option for young adults . " It 's a spinoff of the phrase , " the preferential option for the poor . " Sadly young adults are an option : We can do with them or without them . But what would it be like if every Catholic parish said , " We 're going to go after people 20 to 40 " ? You would regenerate church life in two years . It 's that simple . Some parishes say , " We do n't have young adults around here . " That 's a bald-faced lie . If you look at who 's inside the church building , you 're correct , but if you look at who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , married people with kids are young adults . Why not give all the dads a job ? Let them be the Communion ministers . Once you start , it perpetuates itself . Young married people always tell me they 're hungry for conversation with others like them . Every parish should have an activity for young couples . How will we stay in touch with married couples , with those baptizing kids ? Right now we usually do nothing . The church is pushing evangelization right now . Could that help ? My thesis is that the target of evangelization is our own young people . It 's simple : Look out on Sunday . Who 's there and who 's not there ? You do n't need a research firm to tell you the answer . The target for evangelization is the people who were born and raised Catholic , nurtured in the Catholic community , whose parents grieve for the fact that they 're not around with any regularity . If their parents know that , then everyone else knows about it , too . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think they necessarily have an understanding of where young people are with their lives . They just want them to go to church . You ca n't blame them . But for young adults , life is not neat and tidy . If we 're expecting perfection , you 're not going to have young adults around . Do n't you get flack for pitching your work as marketing and sales ? It 's secular language for doing what Jesus did . I tease that I 'm a peddler : I sell God for a living . I believe in that passionately . You know , Jesus did not say , " Go and be the light of the world . " He said , " You are the light of the world . " The light is already within . I do not believe in giving people a God from on high but in pulling out a God that 's within . That 's as Catholic as it gets . Sidebar The virtue of the new millennium is hospitality . Hospitality means you 're not judged first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to learn over the years that I 'm in marketing and sales . I listen to the target group , see how it lives . // <p>
