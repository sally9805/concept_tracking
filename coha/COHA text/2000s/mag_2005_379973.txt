Like most obsessive golfers , Paul McNeill occasionally ponders the game 's standard frustrations  --  the blown putts , the sliced drives into the rough  --  and questions his devotion to such a maddening pursuit . But as a regular at Kabul 's only golf course , McNeill puts up with some extra hazards that would test the mettle of Tiger Woods . The grassless fairways of rock and stubble are cratered by rocket shells . The greens are in fact brown , a mix of oil and dirt with the consistency of quicksand . Approach shots are complicated by the possibility that insurgents have planted land mines on the course . And your swing may be off-kilter because you probably have a pistol strapped to your thigh , just in case kidnappers are lurking nearby . " Sometimes you look over , " says McNeill , an aid worker from North Carolina , " and your partner is carrying a rifle in his golf bag . " <P> Despite these inconveniences , golf Afghan-style is witnessing a boomlet . The nine-hole Kabul Golf Club boasts some 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expatriate businessmen who have flooded the capital since the fall of the Taliban . The club 's revival reflects Kabul 's transformation , from a dusty no-man's-land to a bustling hub of commerce . Earlier this month the city opened its first five-star hotel ; rooms start at $250 a night . <P> That said , vacationing golfers should n't expect Pebble Beach . The Kabul club was built in 1967 , when Afghanistan was a relaxed kingdom with movie theaters , women wearing short skirts and plenty of Western tourists . After the U.S.S.R. invaded , its army dug in near the seventh hole , and the course became a battlefield , with mujahedin fighters attacking from the hills above . The Soviets arrested the local pro , Mohammed Afzal Abdul , for being a U.S. spy ; his interrogators said it was because golf was such a capitalist , bourgeois sport . After fleeing to Pakistan , Afzal returned to Kabul shortly before the Taliban seized power . He tried to interest a few turbaned Taliban in the game , but he says , " They were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and Afghan troops toppled the Taliban in 2001 , Afzal teamed up with McNeill , who , as a hobby from his relief work , helped restore golf courses in war-ravaged Rwanda and Georgia . " I thought we should leave a few of the rusted tanks and missile launchers out there on the fairways as a testament to history , " McNeill says , " but Afzal said , ' No , it 's time for a new chapter . ' " Afzal cleared away land mines by borrowing a flock of sheep from a nomad and setting them loose on the course . A few were blown up , but Afzal 's philosophy is , Better dead sheep than dead golfers . ( He paid the nomad for the lost sheep . ) The United Nations later turned the course into a training area for mine-sniffing dogs . " Our club is now perfectly safe , " he says . <P> But running a golf club in Kabul is not easy . The club advises golfers to bring their own plastic mats and play shots off them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So are tees and golf balls . The pro shop has a few sets of rental clubs that look as if they were donated by Fred Flintstone.
