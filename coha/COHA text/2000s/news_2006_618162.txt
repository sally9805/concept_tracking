<p> Come Sunday , Marcus Austin will rise and , dressed in his Sunday best , head to the Word of Faith Family Worship Cathedral near his home in Douglasville . <p> This has been his routine since moving here from Vacaville , Calif. , a month ago . <p> Not so long ago , though , the 23-year-old would 've been curled up under the covers like so many other men . Or like the scene in the 1959 Norman Rockwell print , " Sunday Morning , " slunk down in an easy chair reading the newspaper as the wife leads their children out the door . <p> " As long as I believed in God , " he said , " I felt I did n't need to be there . " <p> If you 've ever wondered why so many men , and black men in particular , share that view , you 're not alone . The question has been raised in countless studies and dissertations , newspaper columns , books and , yes , even art . <p> Lucius Felder of Decatur thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my opinion , is not about helping black men , " he said . " It 's a moneymaking business . " <p> Those who agree with him also argue that the " black church " is no longer relevant , that it offers " no discernible message for what ails the 21st-century black male soul . " <p> That perception , said the Rev. Fredrick Robinson , pastor of Mount Gilead Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta , is perhaps the biggest problem the church faces . <p> " You 've heard the saying that the black man is in jail waiting for justice and the black woman is in church waiting for Jesus , " he said . " Well , until the church projects the image of speaking truth to power , of being serious and aggressive about community uplift and economic empowerment , a lot of black men will remain uninterested . " <p> But some who 've studied the issue , who acknowledge that to a certain extent the men may have a point , say the problem is n't so much the church as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God asked in the Garden of Eden : <p> " Adam , where are you ? " <p> According to the Barna Research Group , a Christian research firm based in Ventura , Calif. , more than 90 percent of American men believe in God , and five out of six call themselves Christian . But only two out of six attend church on any given Sunday . <p> " I 've preached at megachurches that seat 8,000 , " said Jawanza Kunjufu , author of " Adam ! Where Are You ? Why Most Black Men Do n't Go to Church " and the more recent " Developing Strong Black Male Ministries . " <p> " I 'll ask the men to stand and 2,300 to 3,000 brothers stand up , " Kunjufu said . " But if you ask the sisters to stand , now you 're talking 4,500 and you ca n't even see the brothers anymore . " <p> Robert Franklin , a professor of social ethics at Emory University 's Candler School of Theology , said the relationship between men and the church " has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But he said , " The problem is n't the church . The problem is with man 's own spiritual journey and identity . " <p> Institutional and personal <p> It 's not exactly clear when the schism began . In that ancient garden ? The migration to the inner city ? Or in more recent years ? <p> What seems certain , however , is the impact of the mass migration of African-Americans to urban areas . <p> " In a more rural environment there was a closer percentage of men and women in church and more youth , " Kunjufu said . " As more of us became urbanized , fewer men attended and mothers did n't require their sons to attend . " <p> Five groups , Kunjufu said , generally have the greatest problem believing in Christianity and Jesus : those who are male , those who are educated , those who are young  --  and Afrocentric , and those who are wealthy . <p> " And do n't let a brother have all five , " he said . <p> More than two decades before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesis at Harvard University on why black men leave the church . The answers were both institutional and personal . <p> For instance , Franklin said , many men were turned off by the promotion of virtues like humility , sermons that advocated turning the other cheek rather than resistance , including , if necessary , violence . <p> " Malcolm challenged Martin on this very issue , " he said . <p> In addition , the men said the services were too long , that there was too much emphasis on money , and moral hypocrisy by church leaders . Many men , he said , also focused on their own moral failure . <p> " They did n't feel worthy to return to the church , " he said . " But they still believed in God and were willing to return to a different kind of church . " <p> Men at MegaFest <p> If men are absent from church , there was no shortage of them recently at T.D . Jakes ' MegaFest conference held here last month . <p> Marcus Austin attended with a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and youngest son . Fifty-four-year-old John Sheppard traveled there with a group from Baltimore , as did 64-year-old Francisco Raphael of San Antonio . <p> All of them said they attend church regularly . All of them had an answer when asked why women outnumber them on Sunday mornings . <p> " They do n't see the need for spirituality , " said Groves , who has a Ph.D . in education . " They think if they get enough women , a little bit more money , if they play a little harder , it 'll fill that empty place in their lives that only God can fill . " <p> Groves said that many of those who attend the conference year after year are members of a church . <p> " Some come because their wives say , ' You 're coming , ' and when this is over , " Groves said , " they go back to their community and do n't do anything until the next conference . " <p> But Groves , Sheppard and Raphael , who is a member of Cornerstone Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of men at church is hardly unique to the African-American community . <p> " It 's a universal issue , " they said . <p> ' A deep suspicion ' <p> Submitting to a strong male moral authority figure was absolutely a deal breaker for Lucius Felder . <p> " The pastor asked me to submit to him , " Felder said . " That means I give up who I am . " <p> Felder , 58 , grew up in the church and has many family members still active in the church . <p> " My oldest brother pastors a church in Kansas City , " he said . " My stepfather was a pastor . " <p> And he himself played an active role , holding several leadership positions at his church , including chairman of the board of directors and as a member of the deacon board . <p> But by 1995 , he 'd grown discontented with how his church operated and perpetuated misconceptions about who Jesus Christ is , he said . He also found it difficult to reconcile Christianity with slavery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've killed in the name of Christianity but we call other people terrorists , " he said . " What are we ? " <p> Still Felder said God " is first and foremost in my life and I always give reverence to him . " <p> Franklin said African-American men like Felder are keenly aware of the long history of neglect of certain issues , principally dealing with slavery , as well as outright manipulation and falsehoods propagated by churches . <p> " There is a deep suspicion implanted early on , " Franklin said . <p> Said Robinson : " Black men detest phoniness . And nothing is more phony than the notion that race no longer matters in America . Too many Word preachers and nonpolitically inclined traditionalists believe because we are all saved we no longer see race . " <p> Prison ministry essential <p> Reversing the exodus of men  --  especially young men  --  from Christianity will take a cultural shift on the part of church pastors , who can not only preach but put the Gospel to work solving the social problems plaguing their communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can participate in a variety of ministries that allow them the chance to discuss issues of importance to them , including drug outreach and mentoring youth . And plans are under way to begin a " speaker series " that will focus on such issues as joblessness , drugs and crime . <p> " You have to meet people where they are , on the street , in the public schools and the prisons , " said R. Drew Smith , a scholar in residence at Morehouse College . " You ca n't carry on business as usual when we 're dealing with unusual circumstances . " <p> They might begin , Kunjufu suggested , with Monday night football . <p> " If you know that men are logical and visual , and we live in a country that is capitalistic , " he said , " hold Bible study on Monday night . " <p> But in addition to Bible study , provide a room just for watching the game and sharing a meal , a room for those who want to learn about the stock market , another for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former inmates having problems getting their record expunged and are in need of jobs . <p> Because one of every three African-American males is in the penal system , either in jail , state or federal pen or on probation , it 's imperative for churches to have a prison ministry . <p> " Seventy percent of those are there because of drug possession , " he said , " so what are you doing about drug addiction , which is wiping out black families . " <p> To attract and keep youth , he suggested a " holy hip-hop " Saturday night lock-in to keep kids off the street and on the premises for church on Sunday morning . <p> Kunjufu said studies show that if a child gets saved , 4 percent of the family will follow . If a mother gets saved , 17 percent of the family will follow , but if a man gets saved , 93 percent of the family will follow . <p> " When you save a man , you save a family , " Kunjufu said . <p> Smith said churches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain black men in greater numbers . <p> He said , however , middle-class messages about prosperity and working your way up the social ladder do n't speak to young black males who 've been socialized on street violence , on broken homes , drug culture and underground economies . <p> " What we have in the African-American community is at least two societies growing up side by side , " said Smith . <p> One half is developing well , taking advantage of professional growth opportunities in faith organizations and half are growing up outside the influences of our church and community institutions . <p> When churches commit to reaching people where they are , Smith said , they will see progress . <p> He cautioned , however , that " progress should not be measured in Sunday attendance , but in relationships fostered and lives changed .
