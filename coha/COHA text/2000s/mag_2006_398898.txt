WOMEN POINT OUT OUR BIGGEST STYLE MISTAKES AND WE SHOW YOU HOW TO FIX THEM <p> Brian Presley understands the power of clothes . When he put on the uniform of the U.S. Army Reserve for Home of the Brave , a new film about soldiers returning from Iraq , it changed him . " Wardrobe is a huge thing , " says Presley . " It helps put you in the mind frame of the character  --  the walk , the talk  --  when you 're wearing what that character would wear . It 's a big thing . It 's a confidence thing . " <p> When he 's in civilian clothes at home in Los Angeles , his wardrobe advisor is his wife , actress Erin Hershey Presley . <p> " Man , I 've really got it bad .
