You might not realize it in a media environment that 's ravenous for teen celebrities , but Hollywood is a little short on young stars these days . Tom and Julia have been up there for ages ; Vin Diesel and The Rock are not so much human beings as Soviet-era statuary . Yes , there are gifted , charismatic actors out there waiting to take over , but they do n't always get the movies to match their talents . <P> Reese Witherspoon , 26 , was a critics ' darling ( especially in Election ) before she earned fame last year in Legally Blonde . Superficially , Sweet Home Alabama is a similar fish-out-of-water scenario . Blonde sent a Beverly Hills fashionista to Harvard Law School ; Sweet sends Southern gal Melanie  --  who had fled to New York City , found success as a designer and landed the mayor 's son as her fiance  --  back home to get a quick divorce from Jake ( Josh Lucas ) , the boy she had loved , wed and left in rancor . But Jake is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole town turns on Melanie for becoming a spoiled Yankee brat . And the mayor dispatches spies to learn her dirty white-trash secret . <P> The film ( directed by Andy Tennant ) has more problems than Melanie , and they 're insoluble . Its lazy calculation telegraphs each plot turn and underlines emotions with corn-pone music . And the decision to turn Melanie into a snarky city critter , who must spend the film 's second half apologizing to everyone she insulted in the first half , sabotages Witherspoon 's ability to be the full star package : pretty , smart and caring . <P> Jake Gyllenhaal has just those qualities , plus huge brown eyes and a fretful mouth , giving him the look of a spaniel afraid he 's about to be swatted . He won kind notices in October Sky and The Good Girl , and now in Moonlight Mile he heads a cast that includes Dustin Hoffman , Susan Sarandon and Holly Hunter . What 's more , he is playing a young man who , after his fiance 's death by gunfire , is living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can he carry all that freight ? <P> With no sweat . Gyllenhaal is at ease in front of the camera . The huffing falls to writer-director Brad Silberling ( City of Angels ) , who wants his film to be a cross between The Graduate and In the Bedroom , to reopen the wounds of the Vietnam era and somehow to have it all end happily . The film is full of sharp acting and home truths , but its ambition to be different finally surrenders to its need to be loved . <P> Moonlight Mile 's finest performance is by a virtual unknown , Ellen Pompeo , as a bereft soul who becomes Gyllenhaal 's love interest . Forging a deep bond with the actor and the audience , Pompeo is lovely , funny , intense  --  star quality in the making . Now let 's see if she and Hollywood know what to do with it .  --  By Richard Corliss
