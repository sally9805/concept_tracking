<p> Years before his agents killed her brother , Saddam Hussein offered a fleeting hope to Samia Amin . <p> She was the youngest of seven children growing up in a Kurdish part of northern Iraq , about 5 years old when Saddam 's Baath Party took power in 1968 . Kurdish men in her neighborhood had been fighting the government for years , but Saddam promised autonomy . <p> He even let Samia and her classmates sing once-banned anthems on field trips to oil refineries and cigarette factories . <p> " The people who speak the Kurdish language will never die , " they would sing . " They are alive and proud . Even bombs will not break them . " <p> Saddam reneged on his pledges before the fragile peace took root . <p> Fighting resumed . <p> Samia fell asleep again to gunfire and explosions from snowcapped mountains that ring Irbil , a city of 500,000 about 200 miles north of Baghdad .

She also knew his agents would imprison her if she complained . <p> " We could n't hate him with our words . We just hated him in our hearts , " she said at her townhouse in Clarkston . <p> Kurds ' hatred builds <p> Samia said her family lived a decent life by the standards of Irbil . <p> Her father had a good job installing phone lines and a side business producing honey . The family lived in a two-story brick house . <p> All around them , talk of rebellion against Saddam swirled in the crisp mountain air . <p> Samia watched neighbors , mainly young men , leave to join the peshmerga , the Kurdish fighters battling for autonomy . She knew women whose husbands were captured or killed . But she also heard whispers about neighbors spying for Saddam . <p> In this climate of political violence , intrigue and passion , Samia tried to forge an ordinary life .

She and her siblings tried to focus instead , she said , on building a life for themselves . <p> Samia 's brother , Kamal , was doing particularly well . <p> He moved to Baghdad and bought his own house and a pharmacy . His got married and , within months , his wife was pregnant . <p> Everything was falling into place . <p> A brother 's last words <p> One day in September 1983 , two agents of Saddam 's secret police visited Kamal at the pharmacy . <p> Samia talked to her brother several times after the visit and still remembers what he said about it . <p> Kamal was training pharmacy students , and the agents said they wanted a student 's address . Kamal said he did n't have it . The agents left with a warning that they would return in a week . <p> " He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know very well that they will get him and kill him , ' " Samia said . <p> She urged Kamal to leave Baghdad , to go to the mountains , to go somewhere , anywhere . If he did , Kamal asked , what would happen to his house ? To his pharmacy ? What kind of life could he and his pregnant wife expect ? <p> When the agents returned , Kamal told them he did n't know the student 's address . They said they would give Kamal one more week . <p> He and his wife drove to Irbil , to talk with Samia and others relatives . <p> " That night , no one slept , " Samia said . <p> She pleaded with Kamal not to go back to Baghdad , but he did . The next time the agents returned , they let Kamal call his brother-in-law . <p> He later recounted the conversation to Samia . <p> " Saddam 's security men are here , " Kamal had told him . " They are taking me with them . " <p> Savage treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own people . Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were jailed or killed . Anyone remotely suspected of opposing the regime faced beatings , torture and executions . Many of the 830 Iraqis living in metro Atlanta describe his agents chaining them to walls , beating the soles of their feet and executing people for perceived slights . <p> For Samia , what happened to her brother hardened a simmering hostility into visceral hatred for Saddam . <p> " When something touches your life directly , it 's different , " she said . <p> For months , she clung to a faint hope that her brother was alive . Since the family had never seen his body , Samia and Kamal 's wife went to Baghdad to plead for information . Sometimes guards laughed , Samia said . They told her they had no record of anyone with her brother 's name . <p> Finally , after Kamal 's wife gave a gift of expensive beads to a neighbor with connections , the secret police summoned her to a meeting . Samia went , too . <p> " Kamal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer said . " We will inform you of the details later . " <p> Excited over 1991 war <p> In the wake of anguish came the guilt . <p> " How could I enjoy my life after my brother died ? " she said . " I said I would never get married . " <p> She was thrilled by the approach of the 1991 Persian Gulf War , triggered by Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait the year before . Here , finally , Samia thought , was a chance to get rid of Saddam . When the bombing knocked out electrical and water service at her house , she did not complain . And when allied bombs meant for a satellite tower missed their mark and killed at least 20 civilians , Samia saw it as a cost of removing the tyrant from power . <p> Then the war stopped . The United States had forced Saddam out of Kuwait , but left him in power in Baghdad . <p> " It was the saddest day of my life , " Samia said . <p> Encouraged by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the south rebelled against Saddam . Washington , however , stood by while the dictator crushed the revolts , killing tens of thousands . Samia joined an exodus to the mountains of hundreds of thousands of Kurds . <p> She lived in a car for 17 days , she said , eating eggs and potatoes handed out by relief workers . Finally , the allies imposed no-fly zones that limited the movements of Saddam 's military in northern and southern Iraq . Samia returned to Irbil and married a man whose status as a peshmerga fighter attracted her . <p> " I was full of anger . I wanted revenge , " she said . <p> She gave birth to a daughter , Saya , in 1994 , became a school principal and stepped up her public criticism of Saddam , emboldened by the region 's autonomy and the protection provided by U.S. and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones . <p> In one speech , she said , she exhorted Iraqis to " let the regime die !

Then the U.S. government resettled her as a refugee . <p> Sunday 's news <p> Samia and Saya , now 9 , live in a two-story townhouse in Clarkston . <p> She works at a nonprofit agency , tutoring refugee children and helping their parents understand the education system in Georgia . Saya talks about wanting to be a teacher or an archaeologist or a prosecutor after she goes to Harvard . <p> This year , mother and daughter watched the U.S.-led war against Iraq with concern for friends and relatives still in Irbil . When U.S. troops chased Saddam from power , Samia said , she felt a strange hope that her brother might be alive after all .

' " Saya said . <p> Samia raced downstairs . She sat on their sofa , staring at the TV screen . <p> " I told Saya , ' This is Mommy 's day . No Disney Channel today , ' " Samia said . <p> She would like to attend Saddam 's trial , she said . <p> She thinks he should suffer for what he did to Kamal and other Iraqis . <p> " His capture is a big happiness , but that does not bring my brother back , " she said .
