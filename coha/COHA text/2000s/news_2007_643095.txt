<p> Susan Meiselas is looking a bit shaken . She has just heard that her trip to Guinea , scheduled to start the next day , has been canceled ; her driver there has been assaulted and is fleeing the country . She is working with Human Rights Watch photographing child domestic workers , and clearly someone did n't like it . <p> " He was beaten by some combination of army and police and has to leave the country , " she said . " I was due to leave tomorrow on my way back there . " <p> Her assignment was meant as a sequel to her photographs of Indonesian maids in Singapore last year . " It 's a strange thing to have your knapsack filled with film and cameras and be stopped on track , " she said . <p> She was in this southern French city to help commemorate the 60th anniversary of Magnum , the photographers ' agency she joined at 26 . Some of her work , which covers a range that includes war in Nicaragua and sadomasochism in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the city 's annual photographic festival , Les Rencontres d'Arles . <p> One of just 6 women among 52 active photographers at the agency , which was founded by Robert Capa , George Rodger , David Seymour and Henri Cartier-Bresson , Ms. Meiselas is known for her searing photographs of conflict . <p> She is also constantly questioning what photography can do as the technological and economic landscape that surrounds it radically shifts . <p> Ms. Meiselas 's work was spotted by the Magnum photographer Gilles Peress in 1976 . She had just completed her first in-depth project  --  black-and-white shots of carnival strippers in New England  --  and taken the pictures to Harper 's magazine . <p> It declined to publish them but assigned her to photograph women at the Democratic National Convention . Mr. Peress , whom Ms. Meiselas met on that job , took her portfolio to Magnum , which invited her to join the same year . <p> Magnum at that time , she said , was " a very potent place " where photographers were being dispatched to faraway assignments . Being exposed to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photographer . <p> " Before Magnum , I 'm not sure I would have imagined myself going places I did n't belong , " she said . Shortly afterward , she headed for Nicaragua and El Salvador , whose civil wars were to absorb her for more than a decade . <p> " I was hard-core ; it was hard to get me to leave that region , " she said during a speech at the World Press Photo awards in Amsterdam in April . " I did n't go to Peru or Haiti or South Africa , I just stayed in El Salvador . " <p> They were formative years in several ways : remaining in one place over a long period made her conscious of the narrative structure of time , and in Nicaragua a sense of what she would try to do throughout her career as a photographer crystallized . <p> " Staying in Nicaragua , I started to see pictures in the present as they would be perceived in the future as the past , " she said . " That was an incredibly powerful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> While a reporter can hear about and compress elements of an evolving situation into an article , the challenge for Ms. Meiselas was to become attuned to those fine shifts so as to capture them on film . But doing so also raised some hard issues and conferred a feeling of powerlessness with which she still seems to be grappling . <p> " Part of what happens if you stay and take pictures is that you feel you will protect people just by standing there , " she said . " But you ca n't stand there that long , and you ca n't protect them . " <p> Taking photographs , she once said in an interview with Nicaraguan television , " is sometimes the least you can do . " <p> Much of what drives Ms. Meiselas 's work is a desire to step back through the looking glass to find the people she once photographed , to forge connections and return their pictures to them . <p> " We take pictures away and we do n't bring them back , " she said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the repatriation of work : it 's become a kind of motif in my thinking . " <p> The notion of moving in circles is now central to her work , but in a way , she has long been doing it . She laments the demise of the Polaroid camera because it allowed her to give a photograph , on the spot , to people who did not have cameras of their own . <p> In a project involving the Kurds , she sought to restore a collective memory to a dispossessed people , spending several years searching for photographs that were scanned into an online archive of Kurdish history , " akaKurdistan " ( akakurdistan.com ) . <p> Grappling with memories : that was her goal when she returned to Nicaragua in 2004 for the 25th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution . She took mural-size prints of some of her pictures and displayed them in the places where the shots had originally been taken . <p> Her war photograph of a mauled body  --  showing just a backbone in a pair of jeans  --  was returned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another work , which depicts graffiti scribbled on a pink wall , asking , " Where is Norman Gonzales : the government has to answer , " reaches beyond Nicaragua to recall all of Latin America 's disappeared . <p> Ms. Meiselas of course has regrets : assignments that did n't materialize ; not making it to Bosnia or Somalia . " Doors open , and doors close , and they are not revolving ones always , " she said . <p> Still , she has not shied from taking risks . Barred entry to the carnival strippers ' tents , Ms. Meiselas befriended the strippers themselves until they invited her in ; she was eventually persuaded to get up onstage in a raincoat and try it herself . " I could n't handle it , " she said . <p> Years later she pushed herself to photograph Pandora 's Box , a sadomasochism club in New York . " It was the absolute edge of voyeurism , " she said . " I had to get right to that edge . " <p> For her it was as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wars she had covered , and the voluntary infliction of pain gave her nightmares . <p> " To be in a small room with two people with an agreement that one of them imposes violence on the other  --  it was so surprising how many people seek pain , who like to give it and get it , and I had to confront that , " she said . " I want to understand it . I need to be there to know . " <p> An exhibition featuring her Pandora 's Box photographs is at the Cohen Amador Gallery in Manhattan through Sept. 8 . <p> Ms. Meiselas 's attempts to step back into the pictures she took decades ago seem not just a way of giving fragments of history back to its protagonists , but also something more personal : a way of understanding her own place in time . <p> " I come out of a documentary tradition , " she said . " We all cross history , and whichever ones we cross shape us as we shape them . " <p> She can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights Watch will develop into another obsession . <p> " They are very vulnerable , they are just very vulnerable , " she said of the girls , some as young as 7 , co-opted from Asia and Africa into the worldwide economy of caretaking . " It 's a sort of migration , and the thing that 's startling is that they are not getting any education . " <p> You have the feeling that she is standing there with her camera anyway , trying to protect them . <p> " Magnum Photos " is at the Magasin Electrique , S.N.C.F. rail yards , Arles , France , through Sept. 16 .
