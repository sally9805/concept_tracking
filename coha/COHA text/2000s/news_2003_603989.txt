<p> PALO ALTO , Calif.  --  As the nation braces for global terrorism and war with Iraq , corporate espionage on the home front by foreign spies may be intensifying , security and law enforcement officials warn . <p> In the post-Cold War era , the most dangerous threats come from all corners of the globe , including China , South Korea , France , Israel and Japan , espionage experts say . Whether enemies or allies , all are intent on swiping U.S. trade secrets for commercial and military use . <p> As one security expert put it , the USA is entering a golden age of corporate espionage . <p> Most cases of corporate spying go undiscovered , and it 's impossible to estimate the true amount . But with the growing global economy and the relentless demand for new technology , experts say , the number of economic espionage cases rises each year . <p> In Silicon Valley , at least 20 foreign nations have tried repeatedly to steal U.S. trade secrets over the past five years , estimates Donald Przybyla , supervising agent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silicon Valley . Investigations by his squad of 12 agents , who specialize in trade-secret cases , have risen 30% over the past year . <p> " They 're extremely active , " says Przybyla . " If a foreign company or country can save hundreds of millions of dollars on R &D; by stealing technology , they 're going to do it . " <p> Likewise , the number of criminal investigations and prosecutions involving economic espionage has steadily increased the past three years , says Ross Nadel , a prosecutor who runs the computer-hacking and intellectual-property unit of the U.S. attorney 's office in San Jose , Calif . <p> The spying comes at a heavy price to U.S. corporations . Fortune 1,000 companies lost an estimated $ 59 billion in 2001 to the theft of trade secrets , according to a survey last fall by the American Society for Industrial Security , PricewaterhouseCoopers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . <p> It may worsen before it gets better . Billions of dollars and much manpower are going to the war against terrorism , experts say , when economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " People are unaware of how serious the problem is , " says Jay Ehrenreich , senior manager of the cybercrime prevention group at PricewaterhouseCoopers . " The destruction is invisible . " <p> Unlike their shadowy images in Hollywood films , the spies are n't skulking about in trench coats and ninja outfits . Rather , the new breed of corporate operatives blend into business settings . <p> They 're well educated in engineering , finance , marketing and the sciences . They 're trained in interviewing techniques and drawing out valuable information . <p> Many are schooled in the arts of computer hacking and computer forensics , of penetrating networks without a trace . Others roam corporate campuses and trade shows , using state-of-the-art spying tools , such as $ 10,000 laser microphones that pick up indoor conversations from 100 yards away by recording the sound vibrations on windows . <p> " We 're in the age of the rogue employee or disgruntled contractor who has access to valuable information , " says Bill Boni , chief information security officer at high-tech powerhouse Motorola . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real engineers and business people , they infiltrate U.S. technology , manufacturing and pharmaceutical firms and weapons contractors  --  the most desirable targets for foreign governments craving U.S. trade secrets . <p> Foreign corporations and nations also try to recruit employees of the same ethnicity , appealing to their love of the native homeland . <p> Or they may set up small companies or consulting firms that work closely with U.S. businesses , quietly pilfering patents and documents over the years . <p> Recent cases that have raised the issue of economic espionage : <p> * Computer chips . In Silicon Valley , a grand jury in December indicted Fei Ye , 36 , of Cupertino , Calif. , and Ming Zhong , 35 , of San Jose , for allegedly conspiring to steal computer-chip trade secrets from Sun Microsystems , NEC Electronics , Trident Microsystems and Transmeta . <p> The two allegedly were hatching a bold research project called Supervision , to be funded by the Chinese government , and forming a high-tech company that would compete with U.S. chipmakers . <p> Their attorneys could not be reached for comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 51-year-old Qing " Frank " Jiang of Cupertino , Calif. , was arrested last month at San Francisco International Airport on charges that he illegally exported microwave amplifiers to China . The goods are dual-use technology used by business and the military . <p> According to an affidavit by Department of Commerce agent Craig Spelce , the technology was being sent to a company with the same address as China 's Ministry of Communication , Telemetry and Telecontrol , also known as the 54th Research Institute , which develops missile-guidance systems . <p> * Counterfeit turbines . Three businessmen and three small Texas firms that pleaded guilty to stealing trade secrets from a Caterpillar subsidiary were ordered to pay Caterpillar $ 23 million . <p> Prosecutors had accused the Texas firms of selling fake engine parts believed to be headed to Iran and Iraq . <p> Jack Shearer , 57 , of Montgomery , Texas , the mastermind of the scheme , was sentenced to four years in prison in 2000 for trying to sell trade secrets to a foreign government or agent . <p> * Alzheimer 's research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stealing genetic material and cells used in Alzheimer 's disease research at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio . <p> Takashi Okamoto , 41 , and Hiroaki Serizawa , 40 , allegedly gave the vials of material to Riken , a research outfit funded by the Japanese government . <p> In May , Serizawa pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and agreed to help prosecutors . Okamoto moved to Japan , and the U.S. and Japanese governments are negotiating extradition . <p> Economic espionage by foreign nations and businesses has gone on for centuries , says John Nolan , founder of Phoenix Consulting , a corporate-intelligence firm in Huntsville , Ala . <p> During Japan 's Meiji era 150 years ago , for instance , Japanese business people signed an emperor 's oath , making it their duty to help their country 's economic growth by bringing back valuable information from their travels . <p> " If you are an economically deprived state , the easiest way to catch up is through economic espionage , " says Nolan , a former military intelligence officer . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-tech economy , corporate espionage has gone global . In recent years , China has been accused of setting up thousands of businesses worldwide , backed by the Chinese military and government , that spy on U.S. firms . <p> The governments and intelligence services in France , Israel and Eastern European nations have a long history of corporate spying in the USA , experts say . <p> Aiding counterfeiters <p> Much of the stolen U.S. technology also goes to the multibillion-dollar counterfeit industries in Asia , Europe and Latin America , where thousands of manufacturing plants make software , industrial machinery and military goods that are sold to foreign governments and businesses , security experts say . <p> Over the years , even the most sophisticated U.S. technology , such as metals and alloys used in Stealth aircraft , has been stolen or transferred inadvertently to foreign governments . <p> " If you lay the heat-seeking missiles from the Soviet Union side by side with ours , my God , they would look very similar , " says David Shaw , an aerospace-industry expert at Kroll , a corporate-intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build it on their own . " <p> Experts say most corporate espionage cases stay under the radar . Why ? Because companies shy away from pressing charges or filing lawsuits , fearing bad publicity and the potential exposure of their business secrets . <p> Others may not even know they are targets . For instance , foreign agents often steal the laptop computers and files of U.S. executives who are overseas on business trips . <p> Business meetings and hotels popular with corporate travelers often are electronically bugged . <p> " CEOs travel around the world and think they can have private conversations in their hotel rooms , " says Peter Skwerski , associate managing director at Kroll . <p> Law enforcement has been helped by the Economic Espionage Act , created in 1996 to combat the theft of intellectual property . Federal law allows for 10- to 15-year prison sentences and fines of $ 5 million to $ 10 million for violators . Dozens of prosecutions nationwide have been launched since the law was enacted . <p> But even the strongest laws wo n't stop foreign espionage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate spy from swiping computer disks or e-mailing trade secrets overseas . <p> The best defense for companies ? Adopting tougher security measures and taking a stronger stand against economic spying . <p> Says Ehrenreich : " If there 's a burglar in the neighborhood , you stand a better chance of catching him if everyone discloses their information .
