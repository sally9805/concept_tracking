House Calls Headnote Children 's Health Headnote You ca n't make a baby snooze through the night , but you can learn to live with one who does n't // When it comes to sleep and sleep problems , my formative parenting moment occurred in the toddler room of the daycare center when my oldest child was about 2 . We were having a parents ' meeting , sitting around on the floor cushions and nap mats , and one mom brought up something that was turning into a major issue in her household : Her almost-2-year-old was n't sleeping through the night . Grandma said to let her cry it out . Grandma also said that all of her children slept through the night perfectly from 3 months on . The pediatrician said you have to set limits . In true daycare circle-time protocol , we went around the room . It turned out that of about 15 kids , only 2 or 3 stayed asleep all night . The rest woke up , got out of bed , wanted a snack , climbed into bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a child who regularly woke up at least once or twice and needed to have a parent come in and say hi , I found it immensely reassuring that maybe this was n't because of something I was doing wrong . Maybe it was n't my crazy schedule and long hours , or my wimpy failure to set the limits that would help my child grow up feeling secure . Maybe it was just toddler stuff . Normal toddler stuff . As a pediatrician , I end up talking about sleep at almost every baby checkup . Sometimes the parent will bring it up , sometimes I will . Either way , we 're often only one step away from an intense and highly fraught conversation . And then there are my moral dilemmas : Should I confess that one of my children did n't sleep through the night until he was almost 3 ? No , probably not . There are some things that the parents of adorable young infants are n't ready to hear . On the other hand , it 's important that new parents understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors they 've made as parents and do not predict lifelong problems . So what kind of advice can I give , bearing in mind that nothing we did got our nonsleeper to sleep through the night until he was good and ready ? One thing I say is that babies are different . I 've had a sleepsthrough baby and a doesn't-sleepthrough baby , and I do n't expect credit for the former any more than I want blame for the latter . I talk about routine and finding a reliably quiet , calm place for the baby to sleep , and about not making night wake-up time fun-no playing , no lights on for diaper changes . In other words , I talk about all the sensible strategies that completely failed to alter my own child 's sleep habits . I do turn down requests for sedatives for babies , though I understand the desperation and sleep deprivation that can drive parents in that direction . Imagine a bottle full of magic drops that gently soothe a baby to sleep for eight hours ! Most parents know about Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advocates letting babies cry it out for specified periods of time , and they want to know whether they should try his method . We keep a copy of Dr. Ferber 's book in the office and lend it to parents who want a blueprint . " Ferberizing " works wonderfully for some families , while others have less success with it . There 's no question that the method takes a certain amount of energy , initiative , and determination , and I advise people to be sure that it 's the right time to start and that both parents and any other nighttime caretakers are on board . Photograph Getting a toddler to settle down at bedtime is often a routine matter // Without necessarily intending to , I often find myself giving advice on a subject I know too well from my own parental experience : how to live with a child who does n't sleep through . Try alternating nights , I tell couples . Decide in advance whose turn it is . You 'll be amazed how quickly you learn to sleep right through anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be those horrible late-night moments when you kick it back and forth : " No , it 's your turn . " " No , remember last Sunday when you said if I got up with her you would do it an extra time ? " " But I did that for you Tuesday night ! " " That did n't count ; she only woke up once . " No one has ever argued that a baby who does n't sleep through the night is good for your relationship . And yes , it 's fine to put a mattress on the floor of the baby 's room if you find yourself spending a lot of time in there . ( I wo n't formally suggest a stash of candy bars and trashy novels , but I 've been there too , I assure you . ) I do n't know whether I 'm doing my young patients and their parents a favor by discussing the issue in these particular terms . I only know that when a baby does n't sleep through the night , anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 've had a child with the normally abnormal sleep patterns of infancy or toddlerhood , you know what I mean . And if you 've had the good fortune to have a baby who slept through the night from the age of 3 months on , then you should count your blessings . The rest of us , of course , are also blessed , what with these adorable healthy babies in our lives . We would count our blessings too , if only we could stay awake .
