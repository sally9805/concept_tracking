AT FORTY-TWO , OUT OF ALL his college buddies  --  except Peter , who 'd discovered he was gay around the time he discovered contradancing , and another guy who 'd suffered a head injury a few years after graduation ( a loose flowerbox crashing , cartoon-style , from his own mother 's windowsill ) and so still lived at home , in the basement , where he did piecework , punching out cork circles for an outfit that made coasters  --  other than those two , Jerry Dudek was the only one of the bunch who had never married . <p> The times his friends felt bold enough to debate the issue in his presence , the generally accepted theory for his extended bachelorhood was Allie Dawson , his flame from sophomore to senior years  --  now married with kids in Lake Forest , Illinois . Accepted , that is , by everyone but Dudek himself . " Got that piano off my back years ago , " he would sneer , at barbecues and bar mitzvahs and other gatherings where the wives grouped themselves to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , Allie had broken his heart pretty badly , but that was eons before . There were so many women since that the idea of blaming it all on her was , he told them , ridiculous . <p> Except , of course , whenever he saw her name in the alumni magazine or came across ancient , bundled letters or an old photo , like the one of them dressed up for her sorority 's Spring Boat Party , with Allie collapsing against him , laughing at some long-forgotten silliness , her wide , gorgeous mouth pressed against his neck . Then he 'd feel a tug and have his doubts . <p> And because of this it was sometimes odd , living in the same town as his alma mater . But this was where he 'd grown up , and so , most of the time , his vision of the town had little to do with her or even with his four years as a student . It was only when his college buddies returned  --  or passing through campus in spring , when the skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if in swoon , like shipwreck victims on the green sea of the Diag , or catching a glimpse of some timeless ritual like the annual Mud Bowl , or walking , in weekend twilight , toward the thumping bass of Frat Row  --  that he thought about his years there . And Allie . <p> It was true , too , that hers was always a name he looked for , skimming the class notes page at the back of the quarterly alumni magazine . Each time , he had to stop and think what her name was now  --  Howe  --  it had been Dawson-Howe for about two years in the mid- ' 80s , when she presumably still had a shred of rebellion in her . But there were other names he scanned for , too . She was n't alone in that . <p> If he were to cut out every mention of her ( which he never did ; Post-it notes flagging the margins seemed sufficient ) and glue them together as a sort of timeline , there was an awful lot of information there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Carl Howe , some bigwig in international steel , about twenty years ago  --  annoyingly close on the heels of their own relationship  --  and moved with him to Birmingham , England , where she had her first daughter , then to Berlin , where she had her second , then finally to Lake Forest . He learned through the alumni news that she and her husband were named to the board of directors of the Lake Forest Arts Council and , during the Bush administration , attended a dinner at the White House . And then , in the latest issue , Allie 's oldest appeared in the special column where they listed " legacies " : alumni children who would be enrolling at the university . <p> Dudek was intrigued . Allie 's daughter was coming to town . Immediately the wheels started turning : Would n't it be something to get close to her ? He 'd joked about it , long ago . He 'd actually laid it out , telling friends , with a shrug , back when he first learned of Allie marrying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daughter , and by the time she came of age he 'd probably be about ready to settle down . It was amusing , and slightly horticultural , the idea of cultivating a new generation of girlfriend . A hothouse hottie . But it had always been merely theoretical , starting , in fact , before he 'd even learned Allie was having a baby . And after , as the girl was growing up in various points around the globe , it had remained a joke . Because what were the chances , really , of ever laying eyes on her ? <p> Four years before , he would n't have had the free time or the money to pursue such nonsense , but his life , at least financially , had reversed out of a tailspin in a way that might have been impossible in the pre-Web world . Fate had placed him in a run-down group rental with a bunch of fellow ne'er-do-wells , one of whom , Ammon , was spending all his time and money on what seemed like a harebrained dot-com . Dudek was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in a series of low points since college  --  and had been saving tips , which amounted to just enough to cover the younger guy 's rent one month . In exchange for the loan , Ammon gave him shares in the venture he kept claiming he was going to launch , LocalYokel.com . It would be a site where you could check out the local newspapers of towns , cities , even villages , all over the country . The idea , Dudek was sure , had no financial merit , but he accepted the shares . It was his way of feeling less idiotic about being a thirty-eight-year-old man living with guys in their twenties . <p> What Dudek failed to see was the service it could provide for businessmen , especially those in sales who traveled the country , making contacts . They could log on in a motel room and bone up on happenings in the next town they were to visit . Two days after launch , Local-Yokel was getting a million hits a day . Three months later the IPO went through the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on the popular Old West Side and figuring out how to tactfully get mention of his sudden , though delayed , success into the pages of the alumni magazine , where all the smarmy assholes would see it and know they 'd been wrong about him . <p> And so , faced with the news that he might soon be in a position  --  though the chances were infinitesimal  --  of crossing paths with the young , single version of what had been , if not the love of his life , at least the one who derailed him , Jerry Dudek was prepared to go out of his way to increase the odds in his favor . The first thing he did was enlist the aid of the guys at LocalYokel . Ammon snickered a little when he explained what he wanted , but once he 'd suffered this minor indignity , the guy got out of his ergonomic leather chair and walked him down to the area he called the Geek Pen , where the real techies worked . <p> The techies seemed less judgmental than their boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too creepy for these guys , Dudek decided . The way they huddled , talking over how best to approach the problem , it was clear they thought of themselves as no less important than super-genius spies , entrusted with all manner of high-security-clearance stuff . " This time tomorrow , chief , " the head techie said , giving Dudek what amounted to a little salute as his fingers flew to his keyboard . <p> The next day Dudek returned , and they smugly presented their handiwork . They 'd hacked into Springfield Memories , Inc. , in Ohio , and downloaded every page listed in the index of the upcoming Orchardian , yearbook of the Cherry Forge Academy of Lake Forest . The daughter , Lorrie , had six pages : Field Hockey , Art Club , Student Art Show winners , her own page on which she quoted Jack Kerouac and Lenny Kravitz and drew her own portrait of Beck , and three candids  --  her arm thrown around a friend , their heads tipped sweetly together ; another with dark goggles and a darker expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class ; and then outside , turned , giving the photographer the finger , her mouth wide open in hysterics . Except for the freaky clothes , it was Allie . One hundred percent . <p> They found him stuff on a regional art show , in which she was listed as a jewelry-maker , and a very recent article from her local paper on that year 's outstanding graduates , touting her achievements and plans , along with those of a dozen other grinning teens , most of whom looked to Dudek like punks and spoiled rich kids . Their achievements all seemed to pale next to Allie 's girl . Hands down , she was the best . This article confirmed her choice of colleges and added that she would be majoring in fine arts . " That 's a wide major , " Dudek told them . " Narrow it down . " <p> But Ammon and the techies exchanged a look and shook their heads . Dudek could n't understand why they would n't hack into the university registrar 's computer and get her class schedule for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing already ? <p> " Some lame-ass yearbook publisher 's one thing , " Ammon explained . " I mean , come on  --  that 's Ohio . But this is the university , man . Even if we could eventually crack it , that 's FBI kinda shit . " <p> He would just have to make an educated guess , he decided . He 'd sign up as a continuing-ed student for as many art classes as he could . Then he 'd show up the first day and see if the girl was there . If she was n't , he would cancel that class . But at the registrar they told him that unless he was a member of the President 's Circle , the number of classes alumni could take was limited to one per semester . <p> " So how do I join this circle thing ? " He almost said " circle jerk , " but checked himself . <p> The woman took a moment to look him over , lingering , he noticed , on his ratty high-top sneakers . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the university . " The smile she gave him was nasty . <p> In that moment , he hated the old bag . Clearly she could n't imagine him as anything but a graying slacker . She 'd probably never heard of LocalYokel.com and could n't imagine that he not only could afford a sizable donation but also employed a whiny CPA who constantly nudged him to find tax deductions exactly like this . <p> So he made a donation . Five thousand dollars . A week later he received a personal call from one of the regents , thanking him and informing him of his privileges as a President 's Circle donor : He could use any of the rec buildings and could register for as many classes as he wanted . If they were full , he 'd have the option of monitoring . Also , the regent told him with unrestrained glee , he would be invited , next Homecoming , to a special black-tie tailgate party with Gerald Ford . <p> Dudek could n't resist . The guy was making him feel ancient . He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still have to meet Gerald Ford ? <p> The regent seemed confused until Dudek explained he was joking . " If you do n't mind me asking , Mr. Dudek , going by your class year ... you 're forty-two ? Interesting . " <p> It was as if the regent was scolding him for being an ingrate , even though he 'd just shelled out five grand . And screwed up as that was , Dudek nonetheless managed to feel childish about making fun of the black-tie tailgate party , so he said he was certainly looking forward to taking advantage of the free classes . " There are some things I 'm really interested in now , " he said , " that I did n't get a chance to explore really , back in college . " <p> " Well , they say you 're never too old , " the regent said . " That 's what they say , and I believe that to be true . It 's never too late , I say . Never . " <p> The next day , Dudek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no illusions that any of this would be easy , even if he could get close to her . Chances were great that she 'd think him an old geezer , either a perv or a harmless , pathetic older guy . But he felt his chances would be better than the average forty-two-year-old 's . Not that he considered himself a smooth operator or overly handsome . He was sort of " goofy-cute , " a term he 'd developed from comments made by the women he occasionally dated and some of his friends ' wives . But he looked young for his age  --  whether from the lack of strain in his daily life or from healthy living or because of some genetic encoding , he was n't sure . He lacked wrinkles and gray . It was this , finally  --  this surface youthfulness , this dermatological , follicular optical illusion  --  that he used to convince himself that he could n't be lumped in with cradle-robbers , pedophiles , dirty old men . Perhaps if he 'd had more of a belly or a bald patch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things might have been enough to do it : to make him feel creepy and out of his realm . <p> And because of his daily freedom , his lifestyle , he naturally did more things that overlapped with the world of the young . He strolled downtown from shop to shop  --  the army surplus , which was mostly just T-shirts with slogans , each apparently trying to outshock the next ; the overgrown mega-bookstore , where he sampled new music at the listening station , headphones filled with the noise of the new youth , bands whose names read like an inventory of furniture in the Ikea catalog . Sometimes he even bought some , and when his friends came across these CDs , he never quite knew if he should feel ashamed or superior . <p> Then there was that other daily ritual . His favorite treat , every night , was listening to Loveline on the radio . It aired from one to three , and he imagined he was the only man over forty in the whole broadcast area up and listening to sex advice being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The callers were all idiots  --  the oldest usually in their twenties  --  but he thought the host , Adam , was hilarious . He particularly enjoyed Adam 's theories that child abusers should be destroyed at the pound ; that junior colleges ( the admitted extent of Adam 's education ) have less right to the word " college " in their names than beauty colleges do ; and that the basis of the problems of the show 's screwiest callers could be found with just one question : " Where 's Daddy ? " There was his suggestion to a couple trying to get pregnant : The quickest way would be to remove some front teeth , quit their jobs , move into a trailer with a couple cousins , and get in a loud fistfight every night ( " Believe me , you 'll get knocked up so fast it 'll make your head spin " ) . And there was his well-researched theory ( construction being his former profession ) that the building trades are the last refuge of scoundrels in this country , the modern-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and freaks flock . With incredible accuracy Adam seemed able to guess the occupation of a caller 's dad . If there was abuse in the household , he 'd ask , " What sort of metalwork does your dad do ? " and to everyone 's amazement , almost without fail , the victim of the abuse would admit that Dad was a welder or a press operator or worked with alloys , carbides , or die-casting , or collected scrap iron . <p> And he loved how the guy used the show to flaunt his success in the faces of those who had earlier discounted him , telling old guidance counselors , ex-girlfriends , and even family members to kiss his hairy ass , reminding them , in his nasal , lazy mutter , that he was now " literally a millionaire . " <p> It was a damn good show . <p> <p> By Labor Day weekend , Dudek had had his first week 's wardrobe picked out for a month . He was ready to go . The classes were Sculpture I , Ceramics I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite understand , even after he sat through the forty-minute explanation the first day . But Allie 's girl was enrolled in none of these . He gave them all a second chance , in hopes that she 'd just missed the first day , but she remained a no-show , and as soon as he could slip out , at the mid-class break , he did so . He did n't even have to go back ; the registrar offered a drop sheet online . He filled out all six and , regretfully , threw in the towel for the semester . He would try again next term . <p> Mulling it over in the next few months , he decided where he 'd gone wrong was in not concentrating on the girl 's jewelry-making interest and picking classes that might connect to that . So this time he picked another sculpture class , Blacksmithing , Metallurgy , Ceramic Bead-Making , and Mobile-Making . At the end of January , he drove to the fine-arts campus and walked to the first class on his schedule . Blacksmithing 101 met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poked his head in and saw a circle of hooded fire-pits  --  the forges , he guessed  --  each flanked with two anvils , looking just like they did in the Roadrunner cartoons . Tacked over the door was an emphatic handpainted sign : We Do NOT Make Horseshoes ! ! <p> He decided to wait outside on a bench , where he could watch his fellow students approach . There was a fat Asian girl and a bearded , neohippie kid who looked like he might make his own soap . And next  --  he was pretty sure  --  it was her . The first thing that registered was the chocolate-brown hair , and it took him back to the Diag , lying on the April grass with Allie 's head in his lap , trying like hell to get through Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance . The photos in his " stalker 's dossier , " as Ammon had put it , were all black-and-white , but he knew this was Allie 's girl , Lorrie . She was snapping gum in sync with her walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-heeled chunky boots that Elton John , thirty years before , would have killed for . She was hardly dressed for the weather , but then , of course , she was nineteen . <p> She walked right past him , close enough to touch , and though he tried to look nonchalant , checking his watch and squinting at the struggling sun , the sight of her made him draw in such a rush of cold air it felt as if he 'd inhaled pure ice . <p> In the next few minutes , as they began to gather inside , the preconception that he would be the oldest person in class was immediately shot . There were two other continuing-ed students : a woman probably close to his age ( though he told himself that she showed it in a way he did n't  --  her silvery , witchy hair , the strained turkey neck ) and a retired postal worker , bald and perpetually scowling . This was , to Dudek , a wonderful surprise : Chances were he would not be thought of or referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest of all , there was the instructor , a stooped man in his seventies , a former career blacksmith with white , owlish tufts of hair and skin so melanomic he resembled a chocolate-chip cookie . <p> He asked them to introduce themselves and tell why they 'd taken the class and what sort of experience they 'd had working with metal . When his turn came , Dudek said he 'd once beaten the hell out of a Pepsi machine that took his money . It got a small laugh , though not from Allie 's daughter . " I 'm just looking for a hobby , I guess , " he said , turning serious . " I 've got my own business , and it runs itself , really , and you know  --  the devil and idle hands and all ... " The teacher nodded and moved on . It was then that Dudek noticed the hearing aids in both ears and wondered if he 'd actually taken any of their bios in or if this was just the normal first-day drill . <p> The teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they did not make horseshoes . He also explained that gloves were not worn . " Less clumsy , " he said . " And it 's safer when you can feel your iron starting to heat up on you . " He then told them that there would be accidents . " You will be burned , at some point . Just get used to it . ' Cause fearing it is worse than the actual burn . " He showed them how to prep the firebed , removing all unburnable " clinkers , " he called them ; how to separate the " coke " from the " green " coal . Then they were to pair up , two to a forge . <p> The timing here was crucial . She was right there , within arm 's reach , but he needed to act unsure , a little lost . His heart was pounding : If he dragged it out too long , she 'd partner up with someone else . " Uh , " he said . " Wan na . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shrugged . " Whatever , " she said , and they headed for the nearest empty forge . Yes , he thought . Yes , yes , yes . He had given this part a lot of thought , figuring there 'd be some sort of partnering involved and knowing that approaching her would raise flags , make him look a little lechy . She probably would n't say a flat no  --  which she had n't  --  but he would then have to play it very low-key , to balance out the aggressiveness of having asked her . So he was all business as they went through the process of firing the forge , following the gruff instructor 's barked orders : digging out the light , gravelly bits of coke from the unburned green coal , making a nest of tinder  --  newspaper and wood shavings  --  lighting the thing , stoking it with a steady , cautious winding of the circular bellows . They kept their eyes on the fire , the smoldering wisp , and conversation between them began only as needed : a sparse commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coke , more ladled dousings of water from the quench bucket to keep the green coal from smoking , the occasional muttered encouragement or admonishment . <p> It was awkwardly intimate , like strangers on a bus helping deliver a baby . Even so , he had to marvel at how close he 'd gotten . He 'd done it . He 'd actually pulled it off . <p> That first day they all made rings . Not finger-sized , as Dudek first imagined , with a slight sense of panic : Would n't that be an awfully delicate project for their first day ? They turned out , rather , to be big , heavy loops the size of a roll of masking tape , used for ox yokes or hitching posts , the sort of thing you might see once every five years on one of those declasse lawn jockeys , the part being offered up , like , Here ... I do n't want this . An irrelevant nineteenth-century exercise , but one that required cooperation . One had to seal the ends with the white powdery " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot joint , like two little palms joined in a handshake . One had to run interference from the rest of the class as the other , the orange-glowing loop of iron held before him in tongs , made a dash for the special anvil the instructor called a " mandrel , " a giant cone in the center of the room upon which the oblong loop was dropped and peened till it slipped lower and lower down the cone , eventually , suddenly , perfectly round . Though it was a useless item , they both took pride in this first achievement , comparing their now-cooled rings , shining with beeswax , each pointing out the superiority of the other 's craftsmanship . They 'd been at it for four hours , and now , at the end , they were talking easily , with little laughs , the caution he 'd felt that she might suspect he was hitting on her and shy away now gone . When she smiled , he saw that old lip-curl of Allie 's and almost collapsed . <p> The class ran five hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow everyone to get some fresh air , maybe a snack . They 'd stagger out into the sudden sunlight like wobbly POWs . Kleenex became a precious commodity as everyone attempted to clear their noses of dark , gluey snot . By the second class he felt perfectly at ease walking with her to the snack bar . It was no big deal : All but the straggler smokers were heading that way . <p> " Last time , afterwards , " she told him , " my roommate had a fit . Claimed I made our whole room reek just walking in there . " <p> " Yeah , " he said . " It 's pretty nasty . " <p> " You know , except for the intense heat and the sweating and the sulfur smell and the soot all over your hair and clothes  --  " <p> " And the black snot , " he said , blowing his nose . <p> " Of course the black snot . Ca n't forget that . That 's probably early stages of black lung . That 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt shear off all the cilia in your ear canal  --  except for all that , this is really fun , is n't it ? " <p> " You hate it , huh ? " <p> " I love it ! But it is almost exactly how they describe hell . " <p> " Except , " he chimed in , " Dante omits all mention of the ' We Do Not Make Horseshoes ' sign . " <p> They were passing into the Commons , the February wind making the door a struggle , and she touched his arm , getting his attention . " Hey , that would be awesome if they had a blacksmith 's shop in hell . I mean , if you 're there for all eternity , it would really help pass the time if they let you do crafts . " <p> " So you 'd be OK with going to hell ? " <p> She shrugged . " Why not ? You get to do whatever you want while you 're alive , really fucked-up behavior , then you go to hell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bring it on ! " <p> They were both laughing , and he knew he was probably gawking at her , but damn it , she was funny . He could n't remember Allie ever being funny like that . <p> On Tuesdays and Thursdays , class days , he took to eating lunch beforehand in the Commons . She was always there , doing homework . Usually she put it away to chat and laugh with him . One day she looked particularly frazzled , a nest of papers scattered around her on the table as she furiously copied something longhand . Her computer was fried , she said , and the tech guy she 'd taken it to said she might as well use it for a doorstop . <p> " I can get you a computer , " he said . " This is not a problem . " And he told her , for the first time , of his part-ownership of the website . She actually seemed impressed . " They 've got tons of old stuff nobody 's using . I 'll just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it up for you . You 'll have it by tonight . " <p> She was clutching his hands , beaming . " Really ? " Then she pulled back and bit at the side of her thumb , something he took to be a nervous habit . " Naw ! I ca n't do that . " <p> " Sure you can , " he said . " You 'd be surprised what you can do if you try . Give me your dorm room , and I 'll bring it over . " Despite her protestations , she took his hand again and wrote her room number right on his palm . <p> As luck would have it , Ammon and the techies had very little they were willing to part with . " I can let you have a 286 modem that I believe Ben Franklin made , " Ammon said , " but that 's it . Check back in a month ; we 'll be pitching stuff to the curb again , I 'm certain . " It was n't a major setback : Dudek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a brand-new but believably no-frills PC , and unpacked it in the parking lot . For added authenticity , he ran his fingers across the rocker panel of a nearby 4x4 , then smeared the dust and grime on the keyboard . It looked a little older , especially after he pitched the box and wrapped the unit in a car blanket . <p> At the dorm , Lorrie was n't in , so he left it with her roommate , a plump goth freak with eggplant-colored hair who made a point of explaining that the Virginia Slims on the windowsill were hers , not Lorrie 's . <p> " I 'm not her dad , " he said , wondering now what the hell he thought he was doing there . <p> But back home , an hour later , all doubt vanished when the phone rang and it was Lorrie and her voice reached giddy heights in a rush of exuberant thanks . " Oh ... my ... God ! " she kept saying . " You are so sweet ! I ca n't believe how sweet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I guess I thought you were just full of shit . " <p> " I am full of shit , " he said . <p> She ignored this , too busy going on and on . After she calmed down a little , she said , " Hey , my roommate ? Gina ? " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " She says you 're cute . " <p> " Well , " Dudek said , " Gina 's right . " <p> " She says , uh ... " Her voice plummeted , and he thought he could hear her chewing on the side of her thumb . " She says I should ask you on a date or something . " <p> " Well , " he said , a little taken aback . He had n't figured on it coming together quite this way . " She 's also incredibly smart , this Gina . " <p> They decided to catch a movie at the Cineplex on Friday night . But Thursday in class she told him she 'd looked at the listing and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just get a video and watch it in her dorm ? Then Friday , at Blockbuster picking out the video ( Dudek resisting the delicious temptation to suggest the recent Lolita , knowing Lorrie would n't have a clue what it was until it came up on the screen ) , they decided to take it instead to his place . Her roommate would probably be in , she said  --  which would be fine , no problem , except Gina had an annoying habit of talking on the phone while Lorrie was trying to watch something . <p> To be honest , Dudek had n't ruled this out , the change of venues ; just in case , he 'd spent the past two days cleaning and straightening , scrubbing the toilets , dusting , and hiding things like photo albums . The only real surprise was that he had n't had to do anything to swing it over to his place , to give him home-court advantage . She 'd done all the muscle work for him . <p> This , he thought , is exactly why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just this situation . They got to the part where the brooding widower gets the chick out in his sailboat  --  only about a third of the way in , but three times as far as Dudek would have gotten on his own  --  when , with no preamble or tipoff or warning shot , Lorrie reached for the remote , paused Kevin Costner in mid-squint , and said , with no animation in her voice , her gaze still dead ahead as if she were addressing Costner , " Would you , like , get all freaked out if I like .. , kissed you ? " It was n't at all how he 'd planned it , but what the hell ? He went with it . They rolled around on his carpet for the better part of the evening , stopping finally when he 'd begun to make forays into her pants , his fingertips grazing the ribbed piping of panties , the soft down at the base of her spine . Then there was the unsnapping , his thumb on the final , no-return gate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face firmly with both hands and kissing him in a motherish , almost frenetic covering of his cheeks , as if this sort of sweet doting was an acceptable consolation prize for not getting laid . And the funny thing was , it was . It was hard to imagine things going any better than they had . " Not yet , " she said , twisting and realigning , reestablishing her bra , smoothing back her hair , catching her breath . Then , as if this were explanation enough , she added , " I really like you . " <p> He drove her back to the dorm , and they agreed to meet again the next night . On the way home his lips , swollen from the relentless kissing , felt like spicy sausages , his balls ached , and his mind was racing with the night 's events , a flip-book montage of steamy motion . There was no way he would be able to sleep . Returning home , he deliberately passed his house and headed to the freeway , driving west toward the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid who was masturbating into panties stolen off his sister ; a thirteen-year-old girl who was having orgies with five guys at a time and wanted to know if she could catch anything from a dog ; and a guy who claimed he 'd felt up his grandmother 's corpse at her wake . " Just the boobs , " he said . " Nothing really gross or nothing ... " The host declared them all screwballs and jackasses , and Dudek wildly concurred . These people needed help . <p> There was , he decided , nothing wrong with what he was doing . <p> In class , he soon found he had to be extra careful . There was an easiness between them now , a familiarity that came from the fact that they wanted to touch , that away from the forge they were getting used to hanging off each other , Dudek slinging his arm around her , pulling her close , Lorrie snuggling her frazzled hair into his coat . And their eyes were always on each other . The instructor barked at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haranguing . " Keep your eyes on your iron ! " he would grouse . " We 're not here to socialize ! " That was exactly why Dudek was here , of course , why he 'd signed up for the class in the first place . He acted contrite and tried to do his best . But they were sloppy . They disregarded their fires , letting them burn out one minute , then overcranking the bellows so that the flame raged and burned the iron , the sparks bursting white like Fourth of July sparklers to announce they 'd ruined the piece . Most classes , they were lucky if they completed the day 's project . They gave up easily , shrugging off mistakes and laughing about whose was worse . They made oblong rings and wonkety candlesticks and hooks that would pierce any coat you might hang on them . Their instructor only barked more , growling to " stop horsing around " whenever laughter rang out from their forge , which was almost constantly . <p> Secretly they took to calling the irritable septuagenarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his hearing from years of banging metal . Outside class , Lorrie loved to make Dudek do an impression of him . Dudek would snatch imaginary tools away , hip-check her aside  --  though their instructor was never quite that gruff  --  and bellow dismissive corrections ; tell her she did n't know anything ; ask what the hews the matter with her and pretend to have taken over the project and finished it all in seconds . " There ! " he 'd growl . " This is how you make a chandelier ! " <p> " But  --  but , " Lorrie would stammer , playing along , giggling , " I was making a nail. ! " <p> " Bah ! That 's no way ! Here ! Look here ! There 's your mile-long chain , girly ! And I threw in an anchor ! OK ! Done ! OK , now a Franklin stove ! Stand aside ! " <p> She continued to make out with him , to kiss him for absurdly long periods of time . The touching became more furious , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him  --  not yet , she said , but tried using her hand , an offer that was sweet and cute , but he declined , knowing he 'd grown too jaded for such a thing decades ago . He did n't actually laugh in her face , but he did let her know that that sort of gesture was wasted on a guy his age . Besides , the bracelet she 'd made herself in class , a bulky loop not much different from the ring they 'd made their first day , tended to clang around and dig into his thigh . Sometimes they would roll around his living-room floor and she 'd grind against him with most of her clothes still on , a policy he remembered , foggily , as " dry-humping . " It was an act of self-torture that seemed now , almost three decades later , like nothing more than a good way to get blisters , rubbing against your fly like that . And if it did succeed , what would be the reward  --  messy underwear ? Not a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But still , he was having a ball with her . He was relieved to hear she was n't a virgin , feeling that actually deflowering her would be too much , a little too creepy , considering his history with her mom . She 'd had a boyfriend for all of eleventh grade and halfway through her senior year of high school , and they 'd done it , but only a handful of times , it sounded like . " I do n't have to be in love or anything , " she said , " but  --  you know , it 's still a big deal . " <p> He told her it was a big deal to him too ; not something to rush into . No fear of that , he thought . After twenty years of planning this , the chance of rushing in was long since gone . <p> And then , the day they made tiny flowers out of screws , Lorrie burned herself . His eyes were on his own piece , heating deep in the fire . Peripherally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny piece from the fire to her anvil ; saw it slipping loose in that too-sloppy motion and falling back . She yelped ; he looked up . She just stood there , gripping her right hand with her left , staring at it as her iron , still glowing , lay at her feet , dying out in the dirt beside the dropped tongs . <p> " In the bucket , " someone was saying , not yelling , but insistent ; the racket of hammers suddenly halted . Dropping his tongs , Dudek gripped her arm and plunged her hand into the quench bucket . <p> The burn was bad enough that she had to go to urgent care . They dressed the wound and gave her a tube of salve and a little envelope of pain killers , barely enough for a long weekend , and they wrote a note for her professors , asking that they please excuse her from any work that would require her to use her hand . He wondered if she would call her parents and tell them what happened , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a chance that any conversation about her family could snake around to exposing enough details about her mom that he would have to lie , point-blank . Better to keep such talk as general as possible . <p> They were heading back to her dorm , Dudek driving , Lorrie crumpled against her window , when she raised her head up , taking in where they were , and told him no , she wanted him to take her home , to his house . She did n't cry at all till they were almost there and then began whimpering , her face still pressed to the window . But it was probably more from pain than anything , because a moment later she was cracking wise . " Guess the hand-job option is definitely out now .... " <p> He reached for her , stroking her hair for the rest of the drive . She seemed so awfully small that day . <p> So it was n't until that afternoon , almost a month after they first kissed , that it happened . When it did , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did all the other things that she 'd been balking about  --  and he wondered , privately , why she 'd surrendered ; if they 'd passed some landmark about which he had not been informed . <p> He had presumed that he would be constantly comparing her to Allie , marking each nuance and movement in his mind and stacking it up against the bedroom skills of her mother . But now he realized there was n't much specific memory to compare it to ; not in terms of sex . Sure , he remembered the way Allie would carry her books on her hips , and how she stood in a doorway in a new outfit , and the boneless way she slumped in her chair while studying . . . but what did she do with her hands when she rode him ? How much was her back arched when he took her from behind ? ( And had he taken her from behind , or was that too advanced for them back then ? ) In fact , he wondered now if most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ever taken in bed ; perhaps he was only remembering remembering . And he wondered now if it was truly the passing of time that had muddied his memory , or if they just had n't done it all that much . They 'd been in their early twenties ; they 'd both no doubt been pretty iffy in the skills department . What was remembered as hot acrobatics had possibly only been a scattering of short events , maybe fifteen minutes of panicky fumbling in a pitch-dark dorm room , hiding under her Marimekko comforter . ( He remembered , distinctly , a woman friend diagramming the vagina for him on a Hungry Howie 's napkin , recalled thinking , Aha ! So that 's the clitoris .. , and though he knew that lunch with the friend was definitely in the early ' 80s , he was n't sure it had n't come after Allie . ) <p> " Wow , " he told her after , catching his breath , Lorrie curling against him , laying her bandaged hand on his chest . " Not bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on his secret vice , and since they were usually awake together in the dark well after midnight , she joined him in listening to Loveline . She seemed to get how funny it was until there was a call from a fifteen-year-old with a crush on a family friend who was living in their basement . The guy was in his forties . She said she 'd sent him notes through the laundry chute , and he 'd responded by asking her out to dinner next Saturday , when her parents would be leaving town for the weekend . Adam 's co-host , Dr. Drew , explained that her crush on the guy was n't really a problem ; it was perfectly understandable why an older person would seem very attractive to someone younger ( " Or why , " he amended , " you might want to seek their attention " ) : They 're worldly and knowledgeable and have financial independence ( " Except , " Adam chimed in , " for the mooching losers who live in a goddamn basement like Boo Radley " ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the problem , " the doctor said , and Dudek bit his lip , knowing what was coming  --  it was well-covered ground on the show  --  " the older person who is going to respond to you , that 's not someone you should be with . What I mean is , what do you bring to the table other than your extreme youth ? Nothing , really . So he 's messed up if he wants to be with someone who 's essentially a kid . " <p> " He 's a whack-job , " Adam concurred . " So steer clear , OK ? Got it ? Do n't even go down there to do your laundry . Burn your dirty clothes on a hibachi in your locked bedroom , for God 's sakes ... " <p> But the caller seemed not to get it , continuing to yammer on with a " Yeah , but ... " So Adam pulled out a bullhorn and bellowed , riotpolice-style : " Young people ! Step away from the whack-jobs ! I wan na see at least a fifty-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorrie snorted , but it seemed a nervous laugh . " Half those callers , " she said , " still live at home , I bet . You can tell by the way they whisper into the phone , like they 're in a closet . " It sounded like she was saying , None of this applies to us . I am not fifteen , and you are not a whack-job . A few minutes later , getting up to use the bathroom , she took the opportunity to shut the radio off . She was scowling , as if she had a headache . There were still about forty minutes left of the show , but Dudek did n't mind . They 'd heard enough for now . <p> Before long , the semester was nearing its end . He was amazed that they 'd lasted this long , that she had n't yet tired of his old-man ways or found him out . There were two weeks left , and then she was heading home to Lake Forest for the summer . She wanted him to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted him to drive her home . <p> " You 're not asking me to just .. , get you to your driveway and roar off , right ? " He was kind of hoping she was . Though he 'd originally relished facing Allie the moment she found out who her daughter was dating , it was now feeling like something he 'd rather avoid . " You 're asking me to meet your folks ? " <p> " Dad 's away , I 'm sure , " she said . " Probably in Malaysia . He 's never home . He 's like that neighbor on Home Improvement . You see his hat , maybe the back of his head , but only for a minute at a time , you know ? So probably just Mom . " <p> That was at least some relief . The steel magnate would most likely not be within murdering distance . Allie , though , would be entertainment enough . " You did n't tell her about me , did you ? That I 'm , you know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , kissing him on the forehead to let him know it was OK . " Saving the best part for last . " <p> " Oh , great . " They were in his living room , Dudek fiat on the rug , Lorrie sitting beside him , Indian-style . She was studying for her chem final , books and notes spread out before her . She said , " I 'm just going to introduce you and go , ' What ? What 's the problem ? ' Let her bring it up if it 's such a big issue . " <p> " You know what ? " he said . " Do n't tell her my name even . People form opinions based on people 's names . Just tell her a friend 's driving you back . " <p> Lorrie shrugged . " She already knows your name . It kinda slipped out . " <p> Dudek was stunned . If Allie already knew , how could Lorrie not know ? How could Lorrie still be talking to him ? " What did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gon na help me haul my stuff back , ' and she said , Who 's Jerry ? ' and I said , ' You know , a guy . A friend of mine . " <p> " And she did n't ask anything else ? Like my middle name , last name , where I 'm from ? Name , rank , serial number ? " He could n't look her in the eye , so he reached to inspect her burned hand again . There was nothing there  --  the wound had scabbed over and disappeared weeks before , but he still sometimes checked it , rubbing his thumb across the spot , marveling at how fast the young can heal . <p> She gave him an annoyed look , pulling her hand back to circle something in her textbook . " She just said she 'd be sure to fix up the den . Made it real clear you were sleeping in the den , something about , ' Remember , under our roof , it 's our rules , ' and I went off on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " But we 're not just friends , " he said . <p> " I know , silly . " She pecked him quickly , sweetly , on the cheek . It was wet , but he did n't wipe it away . " But she was creeping me out with that . I do n't wan na hear her talking about sex and roofs and stuff . " She did a whole-body shudder , Three Stooges  --  style , as if she had " the heebie-jeebies . " <p> " Listen , maybe do n't tell her anything else about me , OK ? I want her to not have any opinions of me . " <p> " She did ask me what your parents do . " <p> " They 're dead . " <p> " I know . I was tempted to say , ' They just lie there , ' but I told her she can ask you all that stuff when she meets you . " <p> " Thanks heaps , " he said . <p> She looked up from her reading , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to prep her ? I can send her your resume , if you have one . " <p> " No . " This he was sure of . This was going to be the best part of the whole thing , seeing Allie 's face ; being there in person when the other shoe finally fell , twenty years after the fact . <p> The last day of finals , he went over with cardboard boxes and strapping tape and packed her up . Gina had already gone home , back to Ohio , having " lucked out " according to Lorrie . Though Lorrie was the art major , Gina had somehow managed to have more classes with no final exam . Lorrie 's theory was that Gina 's profs had been so frightened by the spooky-looking girl that they 'd just let her slide . " What 's the point of becoming an artist and struggling the rest of my life , " Lorrie grumbled , " if I do n't at least get the sweet deal while I 'm in school ? " She was kidding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  but it seemed to Dudek like the sort of crack an older , more hard-nosed woman would make , and he wondered if he was affecting her on some level he had n't realized , jading her perhaps . <p> Because it was getting late by the time they finished boxing everything up , and because they had the room to themselves with a guarantee there would be no timid tapping at the door , no Gina returning from the library , they ordered a pizza and pushed the beds together , making one big , luxurious romping area smack in the middle of the dusty , empty room . After the pizza and after they 'd fallen onto the beds and climbed all over each other , Lorrie pushed herself out of his grasp , got up , and began rummaging through the boxes . She was naked and squatting in the moonlight , her hair chaotic and dangling , and she looked so feral and Neanderthal he wanted to make a crack about Quest for Fire , about things like fire-making and blowjobs and the missionary position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would be offended but because he realized she 'd probably never seen the movie . She would n't know what the hell he was talking about . <p> She found what she 'd been searching for and scampered to the bed , leapfrogging his inert body and sprawling across to her side . He marveled at how free she had become with him . He 'd never imagined it would go this far . Never in a million years . <p> She dropped the object on his chest , unexpectedly . The tissue paper had fooled him : It was hard and heavy and took him by surprise . " Jesus ! I 'm old , remember ? Try not to kill me . " He unwrapped it . It was a bracelet just like hers . <p> " Put it on , " she said . " Come on . " <p> He placed it over his fingers tentatively . It was n't something he 'd pick out for himself , that was for sure , but it touched him nonetheless . " I think it 's too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too big  --  too bulky and heavy . Lorrie had been wearing hers for a month now , but he 'd never weighed it in his hand . " It was a sweet thought , though . Really . " <p> She snatched it back and took his arm and scrunched up his fingers . " It 'll fit , " she said . " It 's supposed to be tight . Trust me , I measured your hand . " <p> He remembered this now . A week before , after making love in the stuffy late afternoon , she 'd remained astride him , holding her palms against his and wrapping her fingers around his wrists . She 'd fooled him , made him think she was just horsing around , lingering in the moment , playfully tugging and wrestling . <p> " You 're good , " he told her now . " Very sneaky . " <p> It was tough going over the span of knuckles , but she pushed , undaunted , and then it was on . It 's official , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard to get on and off , " she said . " But I want you to keep it on , anyway . " She pulled him up , dragging him to the full-length mirror anchored to the back of the door . Framed by years of beer stickers and booster decals , there they were : naked , Lorrie in front , Dudek behind , encircling her , his arms tentacled around her , their mutual shackles lined up for display . <p> " How do we look ? " she said . <p> It did n't look all that comical . In the dim , fuzzy light , her hair draping down , that sweet , beaming jawline , he felt as if they 'd been together forever . <p> " I think we look like a match , " he said . The truth was that it did project a certain sense of connection , affiliation , tenure , claim , bond . Despite the fact that the thing made him feel like Kunta Kinte , and though everyone he knew would snicker and hoot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international sign for midlife crisis , right up there with toupees , convertibles , and Italian horn neck-charms , the idea of it was pretty damn cool . She 'd made this for him . She wanted to flaunt that they were together . It was a high-profile ad campaign for their relationship . She 'd branded him . <p> Later , after she 'd fallen asleep in that wide-open way of hers , arms sprawled like an accident victim 's , he lay on his side , watching her breathe , her right hand casually tossed across his ribcage , her heavy bracelet digging in , and he thought about making some excuse to get out of going home with her . Because maybe , if he did n't go , he could put off the confrontation with Allie till next fall , even next spring , who knew how long ? He could maybe coast through the summer with letters and e-mail and keep the whole thing hush-hush . By the time they figured out who he was , the bond would be so strong that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows till they were inseparable . If he wanted to , that is . He had to remind himself that tomorrow was part of the big plan : facing Allie , getting to see her after all these years . It was far more important than this growing attachment to the girl . Yet now , watching the docile passage of breath parting Lorrie 's lips , the thought somehow made his stomach hurt . It was confusing and complicated and made him wonder if he might actually be capable of falling in love with her . <p> They stopped in Kalamazoo for fudge and again at a rural speedway , not yet open for the season , where he chased her around the dirt track , honestly unable to catch her , and again just across the Indiana border , at a fireworks stand . He was trying to keep it light , knowing what lay ahead . <p> The sign at the stone posts out front said " Howe , " carved in pink marble . Obviously they were rich : enough so to have a circular driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ability not to have to back away and renegotiate daily ) . But they were not Richie Rich rich , he felt . Not enough , for instance , to keep horses on the property . Not enough to use the phrase " on the grounds , " just " on the property . " Rich enough to need a high-tech security system , but not enough to have a gatehouse or guest cottage or twitchy old men standing around with rakes looking like peasants out of a Brueghel . <p> Rich enough , though , he realized , for Allie to feel justified in the choices she 'd made , in marrying this Carl . <p> It was one of those houses that appears , in its details and style , to be a rural cottage , but in its rambling enormousness is nothing short of a mini-mansion , with dark oak beams and knobby stonework and leaded windowpanes , the whole thing slightly Germanic in a way that made him think of the Third Reich ; someplace Hitler would relax for the weekend . <p> The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he married Lorrie , this rich bastard would end up footing the bill . And what a bill it would be , too . These people would expect nothing short of a three-ring circus for a reception . That would be the greatest coup of all time  --  not only to have her daughter , but to have them blow a fortune on ice swans and string quartets and shrimp cocktail . It was just a fantasy , of course , but the idea tickled him . Not that , if push came to shove , he would go through with such a thing if he did n't come to really love her . But still , the image was funny , was n't it ? <p> They left her stuff in the car , and Lorrie went up and knocked , which surprised him . " They always lock the front , " she said . No one answered . Warm reception , he thought as he followed her around back , and he wondered now if maybe he 'd miscalculated . Parents who did n't give their own daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> " Mom ? " Lorrie said as they crossed a flagstone patio . Across the lawn a woman knelt , weeding a rock-garden border . <p> The woman turned then , swiveling on her foam kneeling pad , her smile broad and white as she started to rise , but faltering then as her eyes came at him , widening , those memorized eyes . " Oh my god , " she said , and looked like she was having trouble getting up . " You 're  --  oh my god . " <p> " Mom , this is  --  " <p> Allie finished it for her , incredulously . " Jerry Dudek ? " He 'd been practicing this part . This was key . If he could n't pull off a look of astonishment that at least equaled Allie 's , he would have to slink out of there this instant . Turn tail and run . He might be chased , punched out , shot at , if the husband was n't in Malaysia but lurking somewhere on the property , mixing Old-Fashioneds , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it herself , maybe throw her trowel at him . He hoped they were catching his muttered astonishment , but they seemed pretty focused on each other . <p> " What ? " Lorrie asked , as promised . " What 's the problem ? " There was a smirk in her voice . Clearly she had no idea her mom 's concern was something other than age . <p> Allie looked horrified . " I do n't  --  I do n't understand . " <p> Rolling her eyes , shoulders slumped , Lorrie said , " OK , he 's older , Mom . Deal with it . Jerry 's a great guy , but he 's older . " It was sounding as if Lorrie had given this a little more consideration than she 'd pretended . Perhaps this was a prepared speech she was rolling out , and the adrenaline of wanting to give it , to soapbox it , to really rebel , had rendered her deaf to the fact that her mom had just stated , with no prompting whatsoever , his full name . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or trick me into his car with a bag of candy or give me tootles or pick me up in a chatroom ... " <p> " Shhh ! Shhh ! " Allie said , clamping her fingers over her daughter , s mouth for an instant , then fluttering her hands there , wanting to make it stop . " That 's enough of that kind of talk . Just let me take this in for a minute , all right ? " Frowning , brow furrowed , mouth rigid , she now looked exactly old enough to be Lorrie 's mom . <p> " I think we both need to take this in , " Dudek said . " Man ! I ca n't believe it ! Allie Dawson ... " <p> Allie was glaring now . " Howe , " she said , correcting him . " I 've been Howe for years and years . Did n't you know my name was Howe ? " <p> " I guess I heard you got married , a long time ago . But I never heard what your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it reminded him suddenly that she 'd always done that . She 'd had that same dismissive snort of incredulity back when she was twenty . It had n't grown on him with time . " Do n't you read the alumni news ? " <p> " Not usually , " he said . " And I certainly do n't memorize it . " He gave one of the shoulder shrugs he 'd picked up from her daughter . " I guess I 've got better stuff to do than worry about what everyone else is doing . " It was eerily similar to the things they said during their last real discussion , when the disapprobation of her sorority sisters was starting to get to her . Jerry Dudek 's a nice enough guy , they 'd told her , but honestly , we ca n't see you taking him to your country club back home or anything like that . She 'd allegedly told them , Well , I do n't think Jerry would even want to go to the country club , and he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat at her and led , finally , to the goals/ career/social class discussions that eventually tore them apart . <p> Between them , Lorrie looked lost , her gaze ping-ponging from Dudek to her mother . She looked like she 'd forgotten her " deal with it " speech . " So you guys know each other or something ? " <p> Allie looked like she had stomach cramps . " Jesus , Lorrie . We used to date , OK ? He was my boyfriend back in college . " <p> Now it was Lorrie 's turn to say , " Oh my god . " It was a tiny sound , like air escaping , and Dudek did not enjoy hearing it . She sounded four now and lost in a supermarket . <p> " It 's OK , " he said . " Everything 's OK . " He wanted to comfort her , let her know this was n't the end of things , and he reached instinctively for her shoulder , but the prickle of bare skin  --  she wore only the spaghetti-strapped girl-power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away fast . " Long time ago , " he said . " Way in the past . " <p> Allie frowned . " Yeah , but not so way in the past that I 'm ready to have you dating my daughter , Jerry . Jesus . " <p> " Mo-om . " Lorrie broke the name into two syllables , like she was about to accompany it with a hissy-fit foot-stomp . Her voice cracked , as if she might start whimpering . <p> " Honey , " Allie said , " just let Jerry and me have a little talk , and everything 'll be fine , OK ? I 'm a little thrown , but everything will work out just fine , I 'm sure . " Lorrie zombie-walked into Allie 's arms and stood there , immobilized , allowing her skinny shoulders to be gripped and rubbed by her mom , who then sent her inside to have some lemcin squares she 'd baked as a welcome home . <p> " Wow , " Allie said finally , when they were alone . " What 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " he said . <p> She led him to a bench on the flagstone patio and sat him down and started in with the proposal that they pretend this never happened . He could say good-bye to Lorrie and turn around and drive back home . As a bonus , she promised not to tell Carl . <p> But then he asked whether if she 'd just met him today  --  if he was forty-two and all , only she 'd never met him before  --  would she stir object ? " Because really , Allie , this has nothing to do with you . If I 'm OK with her being your daughter and she 's OK with me being your ex-boyfriend , then what 's the beef ? The age difference ? " <p> She said that was a big part of it , sure , but she obviously had to think about this . He let her . They sat there like they were waiting for a bus . <p> " OK , " she said finally . " If you promise to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Understand ? I wo n't have you ruining my daughter . " <p> He knew she was referring to sex , but he decided to be indignant anyway . " You must be thinking of some other ex of yours . What do you take me for ? " <p> " No , " she said , nodding , conceding . " I remember . You 're not a bad guy . And I 'll try to remove myself from the equation . I guess to be fair , the only objection I should have is the age difference . Right ? So . If you 're willing to respect her boundaries , take it slow with her , I 'm OK with it . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Not really OK with it , but hey , what choice do I have ? " <p> This was phenomenal . He slid his arm around her and gave her shoulder a friendly squeeze . Before he could remove it , she reached up and patted his hand . It felt bizarrely like a Geritol commercial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But she was frowning again . " Listen , Jer , " she said . " You did n't seek her out or anything , right ? I mean , you did n't conspire in some way to meet her and ... " <p> This was actually starting to piss him off . " What 're you saying , Al ? I 'm a stalker ? OK , you got me ! I went out of my way to take a blacksmithing class just so I could share a forge with the daughter of an ex-girlfriend I have n't seen in twenty years . Please ! " <p> " I know , I know , " she said , sniffing a laugh , embarrassed . " I 'm sorry . " <p> Then she went in to have a talk with Lorrie in the den , and he waited . He was starting to get chilly , sitting on the stone bench , but he was n't sure he should just enter the house . It looked like a castle now , and it was as though he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally they appeared in the patio door , Allie with a steely smile and her arm around her daughter 's waist , Lorrie a bit pale and shaky . Her eyes looked funny , and he wondered if she 'd been crying . <p> " Okey-dokey ! " Allie announced gaily , leading Lorrie over to the bench . " I told you everything would be fine ! " He had to marvel at the okey-dokey . He was sure he 'd never before heard her say anything remotely like okey-dokey . Perhaps if she had , he would n't have pined for her so much . <p> Allie told them both to sit while she got some lemonade . They sat side by side , facing straight ahead . He tried lightly touching her shoulder , rubbing the goosebumps there , fingering the strap , but she was n't responding . It was the first moment they 'd had alone since arriving , and he knew the best approach would be no approach . Just keep his mouth shut and let the girl talk . She bit the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you really did n't know she was my mom ? " <p> He gave a big shrug . " You never told me her maiden name , did you ? How was I supposed to know ? " <p> Another big shrug from her , then a mumbled " I do n't know ... " <p> " Listen , if I 'd known , you think I would 've walked into this without at least wearing a cup ? If memory serves , your mom can be tough . And besides , you think you two look like twins or something ? " He lowered his voice . " Between you and me , you are so much hotter than your mom ever was at your age . " <p> " No lie ? " she said , and there it was : the curled-up smile , creeping back . Bingo . <p> " Way more . " <p> Apparently this satisfied her . She slid closer , leaning into him , nuzzling his neck . And as for his own satisfaction , it was great . Things had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lied to her face , of course , if he had to , but being able to say this , to avoid the question with his own questions , was so much better . He could feel her making languid little kisses against his collar , and he knew he was home free . <p> " So were you guys , like , " she mumbled into his neck , " serious ? " <p> " It was a long time ago . " <p> " Were you in love and stuff ? " <p> " We were both different people back then , all right ? " <p> He could feel her biting into his collar at this answer . But before he had to say more , Allie was back with a big crystal pitcher of lemonade , smiling widely even though they were touching each other now , Lorrie making no move to pull away from her cuddling position . Clearly she 'd dropped the " just friends " pretense . <p> " I 'll say this , " Allie said as she began to pour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never heard in it before . " Life sure is full of surprises ! " She smiled so hard he thought she might chip a tooth . <p> It was while they were enjoying lemonade that Lorrie 's kid sister returned from school . Allie called in to her and made her come out to introduce herself . She was still dressed in her academy uniform , unflattering on her twelve-year-old body , and seemed reluctant to be dragged in front of company before she could change . But Allie insisted . <p> " Courtney , " she said , " this is Jerry . Jerry 's an old friend of mine and a new friend , a special friend , of Lorrie . " <p> The girl put out her hand and shook , but scrunched up her nose , still looking at her mom , not at him . " This is Lorrie 's boyfriend ? " She sounded confused , disgusted , or both . It was all she contributed to the conversation . A moment later she was checking her watch and poking her mom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just biding her time . <p> Eventually , Allie went to get more lemon squares , and the kid sister tagged along and began to outline her grievance as they moved inside . A few minutes later , whatever it was had escalated into a big stink . He and Lorrie listened to her whiny , insistent voice coming from the kitchen , and the sound reminded him how glad he was that he did n't have children . <p> As far as he could make out , the girl was expecting to be taken to Tower Records that evening , a plan disrupted by his visit . " It 's not fair , " she was saying as they reappeared on the patio . " Dad said you would take me ! " <p> " Courtney . " Allie sounded sterner now . " That CD will be there tomorrow . " <p> Lorrie said , " Maybe you should take her , Mom . Whatever cheesy boy-band it is , they could be totally lame tomorrow . You never know . " She said it to needle her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her mom to leave , to give them some privacy , at least for the time it would take to schlep the bratty sister to the mall . What he did n't know was if she sought the sort of privacy that would involve smuggling a used condom out of the house or the sort that would allow her to interrogate him further about his history with her mom , to pry out the nitty-gritty details . <p> The kid told Lorrie to shut up , that everything was fine till she came home , and she ought to mind her own beeswax . <p> Tersely , through her teeth , Allie laid it out for her : " Play-clothes , homework , then set the table for dinner . " She snapped her fingers . " Go ! " <p> To his surprise the kid sister obeyed , stamping across the patio , seemingly defeated . But at the glass doors she pivoted dramatically and warned , " I 'm sending Dad an e-mail all about this , you know ! He 'll have my full report in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after she 'd left , " I take it she 's sort of the Frank Burns of the family , huh ? " Allie laughed delightfully . Lorrie did n't seem to get it . <p> The dinner Allie managed to " scrape together , " as she put it , was buffalo tortellini and roast potatoes with fennel and morels . They ate in the dining room , on a long walnut table that gleamed , pristine as a catalog shot . " I do n't know when we last spoke , " Allie said , " but I 'm sure we have a lot to catch up on . What have you been up to ? Tell me everything . " <p> He was n't about to do that  --  not everything , especially not the stints as a caddy and pizza dork and the group house he 'd lived in with twenty-year-olds  --  but Lorrie piped up and told all about his recent success , about LocalYokel.com . She managed to make it sound as if he had n't merely stumbled into the good luck , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely impressed . <p> And of course they discussed their blacksmithing class , and Allie teased them about their bracelets and clucked with concern about the dangers of the forge . And though he assumed the history between them had not been explained to her youngest , some part of it must 've been apparent , because the kid seemed to be listening intently , studying her mom and studying Dudek and interjecting with questions they mostly dodged about who he was , where he lived , what he did , how he knew her mother , why they did n't wear gloves to do blacksmithing . It seemed to Dudek that she 'd dropped her gripe about going to Tower , though at one point , during dessert , it felt like she was maybe trying to kick him under the table . He did his best to ignore this . Things were working out surprisingly well , and he was n't about to let some preteen brat set him off and show him in a bad light . <p> After dinner Allie herded everyone into the family room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this activity as the safest , compared to everyone splintering off to the far corners of the house : Allie perhaps to read a book in her bedroom , the kid sister to what ?  --  plot the overthrow of the government ? petition Amnesty International about her imprisonment ?  --  and Lorrie and Dudek to sneak out back to some gazebo or garden shed and get it on . ) Somehow they settled on Ghost , but soon abandoned it when the kid sister drifted off to go online and Allie began showing him photos in a family album that Lorrie found wonderfully embarrassing . They shut off the movie and talked , and soon they were watching family videos . There Lorrie was at two , running naked through the sprinkler , and he tried not to look at her puffy little vagina , tried not to think of it as a vagina . Then she was dressed and tangled in the shadows of some sort of ironwork , frowning , frightened maybe , looking abandoned if it were n't for the off-camera voice telling her to wave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing of an ornately Victorian bridge .. , and behind her a scene from the Industrial Revolution , with milling workers , dim , square factory , rocky hillside , and grimy English sky . Then there was Allie , nursing Courtney while the cameraman  --  Carl , he assumed  --  zoomed in tight on her breast , Allie frowning , waving him off , and Dudek thought , could n't help but think  --  Yeah , I remember those . They did n't look like that , but still ... <p> The laughter even brought the kid sister around . Sticking her head in to investigate , she saw footage of Lorrie dressed for the junior prom , and when Dudek began teasing about the gown  --  " Was it actually flame-retardant ? "  --  even the kid laughed , joining them . <p> At one point there was a break in the video , a blank screen , and he saw refected in the dark glass , just for an instant , the reversed image of all of them sitting there together  --  Allie perched on the armrest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid at their feet  --  and it looked like a transitory flash of a family photo taken in an alternate universe . <p> And then it was gone , replaced by Carl at some awards dinner . <p> The sunken den , where he was supposed to spend the night , did n't seem like a place to sleep or even enter ; it was as undisturbed as a showroom at Pottery Barn , with a well-placed couch , a well-placed desk , and a well-placed bar , all in bachelorish birch and contrasting ebony . It looked , in its frozen-time , museum-display rigidity , as if Carl might be perpetually in Malaysia . The desk seemed to serve no practical purpose other than to support the framed pictures : Carl and Allie waterskiing ; Carl and Allie in Japan , pagodas poking up behind them ; Ross Perot shaking hands with Carl . ( The guy looked , he decided , like Maury Povich . A little younger , sure , but smarmy like that . All smiles and hair . ) And tons of the girls too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were posed studio shots , hair perfect , smile coaxed , skin retouched . <p> The leather couch , he found , pulled out , though it appeared it had never been opened before . He was standing over the bare mattress when the kid sister came in and announced she was supposed to make sure he had everything he needed , that he 'd managed to figure out the sleepsofa . She carried a stack of pillows and crisp linen , and they made the bed together , the sheet billowing up between them . She was being a lot nicer now . <p> " Sorry I messed up your evening , " he said when they were done . <p> " Forget about it , " she said , shrugging just like Lorrie . " No biggie . " She said good night and ran out . <p> He sat on the edge of the squeaky pull-out , the lights on , still fully dressed and wondering what the procedure should be . Without a door , he 'd probably have to wait till the entire household was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing under the covers . <p> And then Lorrie popped in , ready for bed . She wore a fuzzy bathrobe with rubber ducks all over it . He 'd never known her to bother with a robe . " Just wanted to say good night . " It seemed she was speaking unnecessarily loudly , which he did n't get at first . She did n't sit but ruffled his hair , almost patting him , and pecked him quickly on the mouth , making a loud , deliberate smacking sound . He felt like an uncle . But then she whispered in his ear , " Mom 's right out in the hall , " and he understood . <p> " Yeah , " he said , raising his voice too . " I 'll see you in the morning then . " He watched her bounce out , barefoot , and decided she was serious : He really was n't going to see her again till morning . Not under her roof , her mother had said . Now , watching her go , realizing he 'd braved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now on , he knew he could live with a night alone on the pull-out . It would be worth it , in the long run . They would toe the line , and in return Allie would probably not interfere . It may not have been the outcome he 'd originally been shooting for , but he was liking this  --  this respectability afforded to the " gentleman caller " in the parlor . <p> As soon as she was gone , Allie herself appeared . She was wearing a robe too , hers satiny pink and much more Nordstrom than her daughter 's junior-high TJ Maxx monstrosity . " Just wanted to check and see if you 're comfortable , " she said . Her hands , in her pockets , clenched the robe tight , and he could see now that she 'd kept in shape . Not bad , he thought . For an old lady , of course . <p> " As comfortable as I can be , considering . " <p> She laughed  --  not much of a laugh , just a close-mouthed snort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big leather chair , and put her feet up on the side of the thin mattress , poking at it with her toes . " I guess neither of us is real comfortable with this , huh ? " Her toes , he noticed , were painted peach , the same as the robe . But her feet  --  my god , how could she have such wrinkled , baggy-skinned feet ? <p> She was toying with a sharp-looking letter opener on Carl 's desk , staring at his picture as she spoke . " Well , " she sighed , " I have to admit , this is going to take some getting used to . It 's crazy , but .. , you might actually be very good for her . " <p> He thought about saying , She 's good for me , but decided instead only to nod . But she was good for him , he knew that now . Lorrie was wonderful for him , and just in time , like an eleventh-hour , bottom-of-the-ninth , last big chance . <p> " Besides , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the head just as her daughter had done , " it might be nice having you around again , Jer . " She gave him a smile , waved good night , and was gone , and he was left staring at the open doorway , wondering what the hell it all meant . <p> Dreaming of sex , Dudek woke to the huff of his own breathing . Something was going on . Someone was there  --  in the room , on the bed , on him , in fact  --  the sensation localizing as he struggled to make sense of it , to wake fully , everything still dark and distorted until at once , like a light switch coming on , it all popped into focus : the dark head of hair in his lap , the wet pressure , the smacking sound . It was real . It was happening . It was Lorrie , her mouth on his joint . <p> He relaxed a little , trying to enjoy it , even though there was no door and her mom could come in any second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to see her again . Maybe she 's doing this to kill it , he thought . Or maybe she was running this risk to rebel or claim propriety over him , make it clear he was her guy , not her mom 's castoff or hand-me-down . <p> There was something missing , though  --  the usual press of cold steel against his left thigh . She was n't wearing her iron bracelet . <p> He could barely breathe as he realized it was n't Lorrie . My God , he thought . It 's her . It 's Allie . He did n't have much memory of her doing this in the past  --  unlike her more modern daughter , she 'd only done it for him once or twice  --  so there was n't a lot of specific technique to give it away , to differentiate . Calm , he thought . Do n't flinch . Eyes closed . Act like you 're still asleep . It would be better , he decided , if he could fall back on not knowing it was her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Allie got snotty afterward , he could always claim he had no idea what she was doing . <p> But God , he wanted to watch . He could sort of make her out , through lidded eyes , his lashes a scrim that blurred the image of her bobbing head . <p> This was incredible . After all these years , she was coming around . <p> He was close now , his breathing ragged . It would be hard to pretend he was asleep much longer . And then she stopped , looking up , teasing , posing behind his swollen joint , peering over it at him like a swimmer coming up for air , like a little girl with candy . <p> Because it was a little girl . It was Courtney . The twelve-year-old . <p> " Jesus Christ ! " he hissed , sitting up . " What the hell are you doing ? " <p> She frowned , big-eyed . " You do n't like it ? Does n't it feel good ? " She put her hand back on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swatted at her hand , scrambling away , scrunching himself against the back of the couch in a frantic retreat . " Knock it off ! " He grabbed his pillow and wedged it between them , shielding his groin . <p> Now she looked hurt . " Do n't you want me to make the stuff come out ? " She seemed so small then , so horribly , exactly her age , phrasing it like that  --  the stuff come out  --  the idea almost made the stuff come out , all right , but out of his mouth . And he saw himself as one of those guys they talked about on Loveline , the sort of beast-predator they railed against , the assholes whose testicles would definitely be skating on thin ice if the outraged hosts of the show had their way . <p> She was reaching for him again . " Just let me finish it , OK ? I know how to do it , you know . I 've done it a million . " Using his preteen-to-English conversion , he figured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea was shocking . Whom had she blown even five or six times ? " I 'm serious . I probably know how to do it just as good as Lorrie , " she said bitterly . " Probably better . " <p> He could n't think , could n't look at her ; he was rubbing his face , wanting to hide in his hands . Why was she there ? Why was this happening ? <p> " You do n't like me ? " <p> " I like you fine . " Words just seemed to be coming out of his mouth . He had no idea what they meant . " But this is very inappropriate . Very . " <p> She sat Indian-style on the end of the bed , and he noticed now she was in an oversized ' N Sync sleepshirt . She had a fake tattoo on her forearm , a cracked valentine . She was playing with her hair , tugging at it , and pouting , almost glaring at him . " If you do n't let me finish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Lorrie and everybody . Everybody . " <p> He could n't look at her now , but studied the open doorway , listening for sounds . There was nothing . He could shove her off the bed , throw the heap of covers over her , snatch up his stuff and run  --  it might buy him enough time to make it to the car . But then what ? The kid was a nut-job . Chances were slim she 'd just shuffle back to her bedroom and pout . She 'd wake the house ; the Lake Forest cops would be in his rearview mirror before he made the city limits . <p> " I 'm serious . " She sounded , now , exactly as she had during the big stink about not going to Tower , took that same threatening tone she used with Allie . Poor Al , he thought now . This beast girl was so obviously much more Carl 's genetic responsibility . Lorrie was hers . Wonderful Lorrie , he thought , thinking how near she really was  --  despite the obstacle course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was actually right above him , through that ceiling , only ten feet or so over his head . He thought how she would know what to do , how she might come in and save him ; he thought how this could mean the end of him and Lorrie , and he realized then that he just might love her , eventually , given the opportunity . <p> " I did n't do anything . You did everything . I was just sleeping ! " Even to his own ears , he sounded as if he were a whining , petulant kid holding his breath , refusing to get in the car . <p> She said it again . " I 'll tell . " <p> There was nothing to do . There really was n't . Sighing , heartbroken , he moved the pillow away , grumpily scrunching back down flat on his back . " Fine , " he said . " Get on with it then . Let 's finish this thing . " <p> She beamed , delighted  --  why in hell he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come after him more or less as a lark  --  perhaps out of misguided competition with Lorrie , perhaps to spite her mom . On Loveline he knew they 'd say she was " creating chaos " or " acting out " about something . But the girl had lost track of her aims somewhere along the way and now was simply seeing it through , bullheaded and lost in a pointless ambition . <p> The second she was done , he knew he would n't be staying till morning . " Told you I knew how to do it , " she said , sliding off the edge of the mattress , making the springs squeak . " Bye-bye . " <p> After she padded out , he got up and packed , thinking he 'd slip away without a word . But at the foot of the stairway he hesitated , slipped off his shoes , and sneaked upstairs to say good-bye . The door pushed open easily , without a sound , and he wondered if maybe she 'd been waiting for him ; if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs . Perhaps he could have been snuggled in with her in her cramped twin bed for a few hours and thus been out of harm 's way when her crazy sister appeared in the den . He never was very good at reading the signs ( for instance , most recently , the " I 'm twelve years old and a brat , but I 'm gon na wan na blow you later " sign ) . <p> He closed the door and stood waiting for her to say something , to recognize he was in the room and rouse herself . But she was really out , flat on her back in a deep sleep , head tossed against the pillow like something abandoned , her covers kicked off , her Hello Kitty camisole hiked up , twisted , her belly bared . <p> Like a cat burglar he moved to the bed and eased down , sitting beside her but leaning over her like a paramedic , studying her , trying to take her all in . When he spoke , he kept it so low it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or actually touching tongue to teeth and palate , clicking consonants , pressing vowels . " I ca n't stay , " he said . " The whole thing  --  it 's wrong . But I did n't mean to do anything wrong . Really . You understand ? " <p> She whimpered something dreamy . A smile curled her lip , and her head nodded against the pillow , as slightly as if the wind had shifted it , but he knew this was n't cognitive understanding ; this was n't yes or I see or I understand . This was just a young girl who had n't the foggiest about anything going on around her , a girl luxuriating in the darkness , wide-armed and waiting for everything to happen to her . And so he kissed her , lightly so as not to wake her , not on the forehead or cheek , but on her belly , the exposed strip of downy fuzz that shimmered moonlight right above her navel , right in the center of her , that spot on a woman where they claim babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbreaking lie . <p> <p> By Steve Amick <p>
