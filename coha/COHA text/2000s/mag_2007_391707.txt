Headnote Sanctuary for the addicted AS WORSHIPERS walk into Central Park United Methodist Church , Bob Swoverland usually pulls one of them aside and asks him or her to help serve communion . One day he felt moved to ask Karen ( last name withheld ) to help . As he remembers , " Normally , I 'll just ask anybody , but when she came in it was like God grabbed me by the collar . " Swoverland recalls what came next . During the testimony portion of that Sunday 's worship service , Karen confessed for the first time that years earlier she had killed a woman while driving drunk . She had served five years in a Minnesota prison as her punishment , and then , despite promises to herself and others , she began drinking again . She spent two more years in a county workhouse . " The judge told me I was a menace to society , " she recalls . Earlier in the week Karen had gone to pastor Jo Campe in a panic . Tom , another Central Park member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was feeling excruciating pain over the loss of his girlfriend in an accident caused by a drunk driver . Tom was unaware of Karen 's past , and she did n't tell him . " I knew that he would hate me , and that I was n't going to be able to stay at the church . I did n't belong there , " says Karen . Pastor Campe knew that Karen , a recovering addict who had been clean for fewer than two years , did belong at Central Park ; he also knew that Karen would have to learn this the hard way-by telling her story . First she told it to Tom-and braced herself for his anger . But Tom smiled . He had been to his girlfriend 's grave that morning-exactiy five montiis after her death-and asked for a miracle . Karen 's story of redemption , he told her , was that miracle . Then Karen gave her testimony in worship . She shook as she climbed the steps to the microphone . The talk could go so wrong , and she feared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She could n't blame them ; she loathed herself . But when Karen was finished , she received hugs . Then she helped serve the bread and the juice . Members of this St. Paul , Minnesota , congregation , also known as the Recovery Church , have come to expect God to orchestrate such moments . In 1940 , more than 1,100 people worshiped at Central Park . In 2000 , when Campe arrived , the congregation had hit rock bottom ; only 11 elderly members worshiped regularly . Today there are more than 600 people in church-and 95 percent of them are involved with some kind of 12-step group . In the 1990s Campe was senior pastor of one of the largest United Metiiodist congregations in Minnesota , and he was bound for glory . He oversaw a staff of roughly 30 , had a TV show and radio program , and never missed a day of work . He also was an alcoholic , and no one knew . Every night Campe would drink himself to sleep in the parsonage , where he slept alone because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treatment center after waking from a blackout and realizing that he had loaded a shotgun and nearly committed suicide . " I just could n't do it anymore , " says Campe , who has a doctorate from Princeton Theological Seminary . " I was like a Pharisee in the woe sections of the Gospels . My way did n't work . " Campe decided that he had to leave his church . " No associate pastor and not a single person in leadership had any idea how to talk to me . No one asked about my drinking or how I was doing-no one except those who had been in 12-step programs . " The bishop reluctantly granted Campe 's request to be reappointed to another congregation , and then , a few years later , to another one-Central Park . The downtown church of 11 people could afford to pay Campe only because it rented space to a hospital across the street . He invited several friends to join him , and they begin planning a five-day ministry for downtown workers . Terry McKinley , a mortgage banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan all written . " But then other AA members began attending and asked Campe to start a recovery worship service . Campe and several others put together some ideas . Forty people attended that first service ; 100 showed up for the second one . Soon worship was celebrated twice a month and then weekly . ( A second service was held for the original 11 members , all of whom have since died or moved on . ) Many churches are adding ministries for people with addictions , but the Recovery Church blends 12-step principles with Christianity to inform and define its entire ministry . The congregation is one of a handful of such churches across the country , says Dale Ryan , director of the Fuller Institute for Recovery Ministry . " These kinds of churches are n't started because the fear is we 're going to have really broken people here , and we 're going to need some healthy people to balance them out . " WHAT HEALTHY people look like , of course , often is n't clear . A highlight for Campe was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholics sitting in the first row . " There were two former prostitutes , one active prostitute , an undercover narc , a judge , a school teacher and a " normie " a person without addictions . I looked out and said , " There 's our church . ' ' " Karen remembers the Christmas Eve a young woman showed up drunk . " One of the guys just put his arm around her , and she cried through the whole service . " That simple action reflects the guiding principle of the church 's ministry , which Campe says is the AA responsibility pledge : " I am responsible . When anyone , anywhere , reaches out for help , I want the hand of AA always to be there . And for that , I am responsible . " Nearly 90 percent of the members were unchurched before arriving at Central Park . Those who did attend elsewhere tended to be uncomfortable , believing that they had to keep their secrets to themselves and try their best to look good . " A lot of these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirectly , " says McKinley , a mortgage banker . " This is the place where I go and am who I am . " He laughs and continues , " I 'll look at the crowd and think , " Where did these people come from ? ' ' " Among the first to attend were residents of the Union Gospel Mission . " We kind of adopted this church , " says Larry Bonniwell , director of the mission 's Christ Recovery Program . " We said we 're going to make this church our church . " Now members come from throughout the Twin Cities and from all walks of life . " You do n't have to be a drunk to come here , but it helps , " Campe says , laughing . Then he quickly turns serious : " People come here because their lives depend on it . If we could all stay sober , we would n't be here . Brokenness brings people together . " Many were introduced to the church when they attended one of the 12-step groups that meet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each week , 1,500 people attend Alcoholics Anonymous , Narcotics Anonymous , Overeaters Anonymous , Sex Addicts Anonymous , Al-Anon and other support groups . The first meeting begins as early as 9 a.m. and the last one at 10:30 p:m . Rooms are named for people in the recovery movement : Bill W , Dr. Bob , Father Ed Dowling . There are plenty of addicts to whom the church can reach out , says Swoverland . " We joke that Minnesota is the land of 10,000 lakes and 10,000 treatment centers . " Hazelden , a nearby center that treats thousands of addicts a year , supplies guest speakers every other month . The church frequendy hosts other speakers who address some aspect of recovery , such as how to find a sponsor or avoid relapse . Melodie Beattie , author of Codependent No More , has spoken at the church , as has Karen casey , author of Each Day a New Beginning . All of the church 's special events relate to some aspect of recovery . Every Friday night , for example , the congregation hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriented to recovery when members started the first AA and Al-Anon meetings on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia . THE SUNDAY MORNING worship services follow a traditional pattern but with a 12-step flavor . Campe greets worshipers with " Hi , I 'm Jo , and I 'm an alcoholic . " The congregation responds , " Hi , Jo . " A large banner declaring " Recovery Works " hangs on the sanctuary wall . Testimonies , or " stories of hope , " are given every Sunday . Members sign up mondis in advance to tell their stories , and limiting their time can be difficult . During one service , a woman 's testimony takes several detours before she turns to Campe and asks , " Am I going too long ? " " Yes , " he responds , and she finishes . There is no pretense during the service . A person sitting in a pew halfway back in the sanctuary shouts , " Turn your microphone up ! " to Campe , to which he retorts , " Turn your hearing aid up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church grew , Campe explains , half of the new congregants were former Cadiothcs , so celebrating communion every Sunday seemed appropriate . " We often have people in tears at the rail , " he adds . Just as at a recovery meeting , the service concludes with the entire congregation holding hands and reciting the Lord 's Prayer . Attire at the church is casual . Campe often wears shorts and sandals during the summer . The exception is Easter , when the pastor and many of the worshipers wear tuxedos or formal dresses . " It 's a great time , " Campe says . The music is eclectic and inclusive : there may be blues , Native American flute , hymns and contemporary worship songs in the same service . Anyone who wants to participate is welcome . McKinley , one of the worship coordinators , recalls the time a head-injured member was given a rattle and encouraged to keep time for the musicians . " I 'm sure that helped worship as much as anything we 've done . " People can become members the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk last night , and they can become a member here today , " Campe says after a service in which at least a dozen had raised a hand to accept the invitation . " These people have been rejected so much . We want them to know they are welcome here . " Welcoming people at the Recovery Church means making room for religious viewpoints that range from the very liberal to fundamentalist and include vague spirituality and even non-Christian beliefs . Living with the differences can be difficult . Campe 's theology is rooted in mainline neo-orthodoxy , but he says he avoids being a stickler on certain theological points . " We tell people to take what works and leave the rest . " " I do n't tell people they need to get saved , " Campe says . He believes , however , that within a year of arriving at the church , many of the attendees have a better understanding of the Christian faith than people in some of the other churches he 's served . A strong emphasis on grace helps . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains . " We 're here to celebrate and carry the message of God 's love to all people in recovery . " IT WAS AT Central Park that Karen first experienced that message . Nearly five years ago she stumbled in drunk while on a 10-day bender . A custodian led her to Campe 's office , where she passed out on the couch . Central Park was where she encountered grace , but it is also where she is coming to grips with God 's love . " What kind of God wants me ? " she asks , straining forward in her chair as she leans on a folding table in the church basement . " Die for Jo . Die for someone else , but do n't the for me because I 'm a piece of shit ! " She wipes a tear from her cheek , pauses , leans back and smiles . " But I 'm also a miracle . Jo calls me his Lazarus . " " Keeping the main thing the main thing " is a management principle that every purpose-driven church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only what leaders decide but also how decisions are reached . The only permanent leadership groups are those mandated by thie denomination . Anyone can participate in " the kitchen cabinet " that meets before worship on Sunday mornings at a local diner , although primarily a handful of regulars attend . Twelve-step groups , with their egalitarian model of leadership and emphasis on radical honesty , serve as training grounds for those in the kitchen cabinet . Few votes are taken , and decisions are arrived at by consensus . People are free to say what they feel or think-and diey do . The primary leadership principle is simple . " We really do n't know what we 're doing , so we try to stay out of God 's way , " says Swoverland , echoing a statement repeated so often it 's almost creedal . " There is just so much that has happened here that we did n't plan . " Getting out of God 's way has n't been easy for Campe . He says he was an arrogant pastor before entering recovery . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to learn to let go . " At six-foot-five , with the build and gait of a former football lineman , Campe fills a room with charisma . His two golden retrievers accompany him to the church office each day . Church members give him some credit for the church 's growth , but not too much . " It 's because of Jo , and it 's in spite of Jo , " says Swoverland . In other words , Swoverland and the other members harbor no illusions about their pastor 's humanity . They have encouraged , comforted and admonished him dirough a divorce and other difficult times . They know his frailties . " They know I could take a drink anytime , " Campe says . " As a member of the church , I must accept the pastor as he is , " Swoverland says . " He 's come to me ; he 's come to Terry to ask for help . He 's not God . He 'll screw up royally . But as long as he keeps learning , that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pastor of two churches at once . Central Park recendy purchased the 155-year-old Wesley Church building in Minneapolis . In June , die two congregations began operating as the east ( Central Park ) and west ( Wesley ) campuses of the Recovery Church . The conference is providing nearly $200,000 to subsidize the near future of Wesley . One hundred of the Central Park members are supporting 50 members at Wesley by attending worship at the new campus . Campe , 62 , plans to retire in several years . Replacing him will be difficult . Members say they will be looking for a pastor that few otiiers would want . " You have to have gone through 15 years of hard drinking or being a druggie , " Swoverland quips , and he 's only half joking . Sidebar " People come here because their lives depend on it , " says pastor Jo Campe . " If we could all stay sober , we would n't be here .
