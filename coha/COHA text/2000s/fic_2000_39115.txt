SHE HEARD THE OLD FOOL Pull into the driveway . How could she miss him ? A hundred times she had told him to get his truck fixed , but he never would do it . He could n't hear was the problem , and he would n't admit that he could n't hear , so what did he care if he drove something that sounded like a castrated pig ? <p> His dogs were gone again . Edna could tell that just by the sound of things . Three thousand dollars ' worth of bluetick mixes running loose in the woods somewhere . It was n't such a big number anymore-three thousand dollars-unless you were a pulpwooder and did n't make but eight or nine thousand a year . Oh , a young man might make more than that , but then again , young men these days had better sense than to be pulpwooders . <p> But forty years ago , when she first met him , pulping was the thing to do . All you needed was a chain saw and enough courage to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then , and good reason , too . Many a one sawed through a boot top or cut a branch that sprung back and snapped him into the next world . But not Coy . He was strong . A chain saw was nothing more to him than a tamed scream at the end of his big arms . In five minutes he could bring down a tree it 'd take two men with a crosscut an hour to fell . That was back before the big woods were cut over . Back when you could get three loads of pulpwood from the laps of a single tree . It seemed to her that in those days everywhere Coy turned another tree was coming down , and there was Coy , standing over the carcass , cutting off the money and loading it onto his truck . Now , all these years later , his forearms were still bigger than most men 's calves , but they were laced with varicose veins , and sometimes they hurt so bad that Coy could n't cut . Even though it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still could n't cut . He never said anything . But he 'd come home with half a load or less , and she 'd know . <p> When they were young , though , their wood lot was always stacked high , and as far as they knew , they were rich . First thing Coy always wanted was good dogs . Bluetick and redbone-howlers and criers . On nights when the moon shone down on mist that filled the hollows , the two of them would load the dogs into the truck and drive into the country . They 'd turn the dogs loose and sit in the truck , listening to the howls echo through the woods . It put the hair up on Edna 's arms , it was so beautiful and eerie . Seemed like it was the sound of their two spirits spinning through those trees , chasing after what they knew they needed while their bodies stayed in the truck doing what bodies could think to do . <p> Then came kids , and he went without her after that , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck and listen but had to get liquored up , put pistols in their pockets , and light out through the woods , chasing the sounds and sometimes finding the dogs around a tree . She never understood why they had to carry it that far , why they wanted to see the coon 's eyes shine in their flashlight beams , why they 'd shoot until it fell , or until it died in the arms of the tree . Sometimes Coy told her about coons that seemed to disappear , right out of the tree , somehow , so that the dogs had to be tied up and dragged back to the truck . <p> And sometimes , of course , they 'd lose the dogs . There 'd be a howling out there , but liquor and the hollows confused the sounds . The men would wander into briars or cripples until finally they 'd quit . Coy 'd come home alone , then , and she 'd be able to tell whether he was mad from the way he closed the truck door and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs had struck hard and tracked fast , they might have just left the men behind . He 'd be excited then , and his steps would be quick and loud-what a coon , strong and smart . You could lose dogs over an animal like that and feel proud . But if the dogs had wandered and fretted and never struck hard but would n't come when they blew the horn , he 'd be mad . His steps would be slower and quiet like he was trying to sneak up on something . He 'd tell her he did n't care if he never found them dogs again . She 'd remind him what they cost , but he 'd swear and say it was a small amount to lose to be rid of something that could n't do what it was put on Earth to do . <p> But anymore , it was hard to tell how he felt by the sound of his steps because he did n't step so much as shuffle . She heard him head toward the shed to put away his pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what she thought . For one thing there was nobody to go with him . His last friend , Mr. Logan , was in the White Oak Nursing Home now because it got to the point where he had forgotten how to get home from the store . And there was no way Edna would go with Coy into the woods . <p> Not now , not at her age . No , she had long ago given up foolishness like that . So he went by himself , and it was n't safe . Time was you had to worry about bears and even panthers . Thank goodness those times were gone , but it was n't any safer now because the things that stalked old people were a whole lot fiercer than wild animals . <p> She knew all she needed to know about that . She was old when she had kids-thirty by the time the last was born . And each one brought more trouble-more falling down and foolishness , more sickness and fussing . Was n't until the kids were grown and gone that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the weather got bad , and one day she tripped over a rug and hit a chair before she wound up on the floor with a broken wrist . It never healed right , and so she was never again the woman she once had been . <p> No , it was plain as chestnuts-by a certain age a person ought to admit that he ca n't catch what runs in the woods anymore . He ought to stay home and be glad he 's got a clean , warm place where he can sit in comfort and remember a time when he could catch most anything he wanted to . Stay home . Watch TV . Read the paper . Lock the door . Coy stepped into the kitchen and stood there in his dirty socks , looking at her across the room . <p> " Well ? " she said . He turned away and got a drink of water . " Where are they this time ? " <p> " Ai n't no woods no more , " he said . " You can drive all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bigger ' round than a dog 's waist , and the ground underneath choked with weeds and green briars . Take a weasel to find a coon in such a mess as that . I do n't even know why I keep dogs no more . " <p> " Well , " she said , " sounds like you do n't . " <p> " Ai n't even hardly a tree big enough to hold a good-sized coon . " <p> " You ought to sell them dogs . " <p> " Down to Polk County , right there by the Green River , there 's still some woods , but they 've cut over parts of it , so you walk a while and then you come to a thicket ca n't a gnat get through . And if they do strike in there , why you ca n't halfway hear because the sound do n't carry through a mess like that . " <p> No , she thought , the old fool 's ears were twice as big as when he was young , but the bigger they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better get some sleep , " she said . " So you can hunt them tomorrow . " <p> " I 'm going to bed , " he said , and she nodded . <p> But he did n't get up early the next morning and drive the dirt roads looking for the dogs . And he did n't go out in the evening either . All he did was mess around in his shed all day , filling boxes and trash bags . When he came in to wash his hands for supper , she stood right next to him and looked him in the eye . " It 's good money , " she said , " just starving to death out there . " <p> He turned from the sink and said , " Huh ? " <p> It was bad being deaf , but she had to admit it had its uses . <p> They sat in the living room all evening watching her shows . He stared at the TV , but she did n't think he was paying attention . He never once asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to himself when girls in bathing suits flashed across the screen . <p> " Get up , " she wanted to tell him . " What sort of a man sits there and watches shows like this , like he 's in a trance ? " <p> In the middle of Murder She Wrote , he pushed himself out of his chair . " I 'm going to bed , " he said , like he had lost some sort of battle he had been fighting . She watched him slouch up the stairs , then turned back to her show . It was no use trusting an old man . Once they could n't work , they were n't good for a single thing . She was half-tempted to go find those dogs herself-find them and sell them . <p> He did n't go out looking the next morning either . And at supper he would n't say anything to her but " Huh ? " After dinner , he sat in the living room all evening while the room got dark . He did n't even hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other end said he had found some dogs at his place and the tags had this number on it . <p> " Yes , " Edna said . " Let me let you talk to my husband . " <p> She held the phone toward Coy , and he groaned coming out of the chair . " Where ? " he said into the phone . " Wait a minute . " <p> He gave the phone back to her . " I ca n't tell what he 's saying . " <p> She got the location and hung up . " Let 's go , " she said . <p> He filled two bowls with food and put them in the back of the truck next to the dog cages . " You drive , " he told her . <p> She headed them down the Coxe Road , the truck screaming all the way . They turned onto the Watson Road , which was dirt , and then onto a farm road , which was just two ruts through the woods . The road climbed a hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old log house . <p> " I know this place , " Coy said . " There was a bear tore the convertible top off a man 's car lived here . Must 've been forty years ago . Fool left food in the backseat , and the bear went right through the top . Fellow run him off by throwing stones . Saved some of the food , but the roof of that car was ruint . " <p> The first thing that came to greet them was a Labrador retriever . It looked like a shadow in their headlights . The dog lifted its leg and marked their tires . <p> " That dog ai n't no kind of use around here , " Coy said . <p> Next came three dogs , their tails between their legs . Edna recognized the bluetick markings , but the dogs seemed smaller , somehow , than their dogs . They bred them down , these days . Coy had explained it to her . They mixed in bird dog so they could hunt better in brush . He did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . Not a thing to be proud of , but it was all you could do anymore since the world had gotten so small and so filled up with children and pups and saplings that there was hardly anyplace for something full-grown ; The Lab jumped back and forth , bowing to play . One of the mixes wrestled with it . <p> " Useless , " Coy mumbled . <p> Next came a young man in short pants . He had a little goatee and a big smile . <p> Edna smiled back at the boy and glanced over at Coy . He did n't seem to notice the boy , though . He was looking straight ahead , and she followed his eyes . A girl , also in short pants and wearing the top to a bathing suit , was headed their way . She stopped to pet the dogs , which gathered around and followed her to the truck . <p> The boy was talking a streak about how they had seen the dogs yesterday at twilight but that they would n't come out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage to come up and make friends with Jessie ( Edna did n't know whether this was the black dog or the girl ) . The boy had managed to read the number on one of their collars , and so he had called , and goodness they really loved the sound coon dogs made in the woods at night , but Laura did n't like the idea of killing coons . ( So Edna knew , then , that Laura most likely was the girl . ) The boy had told Laura that lots of times hunters did n't even bother to follow the dogs but just let them run to hear their music and then called them back and went home . Sometimes , though , the dogs would n't come , and so they left them , knowing they would go someplace or other when they got hungry enough . just a good thing they found somebody honest this time , the boy said . Yes , Jessie and Laura both liked them just fine . Real nice coon dogs . <p> Edna had never heard the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he was just from Charlotte , but either way he was one of those people that comes at you talking and leaves you talking and never shuts up enough to let the world catch its breath . Nice coon dogs . What foolishness . The young could have it worse than the old . A good coon dog did n't care a thing about people except for food . No , all a coon dog cared about was the woods and what his nose could take him to . <p> " Well , they sure are friendly , " the boy was saying , " and prettythey sing fine at night . Why , with the moon full and . . . " <p> She turned to Coy . " You going to feed them ? " <p> " Ai n't mine , " he said . <p> " What ? " she said . <p> He looked her straight in the eye and said , " Huh ? " <p> How long ? she wondered . How long before Coy would n't be able to find his way home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this man . She had wanted to spend her life with him , and she had . She had lived with him until , now , it seemed like there was hardly anything left . <p> She got out of the truck and put the food bowls on the ground . The dogs did n't even bother to smell what was there . <p> " Oh , " said the boy . " Laura made bacon and eggs for them a little while ago . " <p> " They sure were hungry , " said Laura , and she smiled sweetly at the dogs . <p> " Let 's go , " Coy said . " Get in the truck . " <p> " I 'll help you load them up , the boy said , and he bent down and picked up one of the dogs . It was n't like Coy did it . Coy picked dogs up by the scruff of the neck and the skin of their rumps , and he pitched them like bales of hay . This boy put his arms underneath and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . Edna did n't open the cage door . She just looked at the boy with his arms under the dog , and the dog looking surprised and yet somehow content , like it did n't care if it never ran in the woods again . <p> Coy leaned out the window . " That ai n't mine , " he said . <p> " But it 's got your number right here on the collar , " the boy said . <p> Coy squinted at the boy . " What do you reckon you 'd do , short pants , if a bear come through the roof of your car ? " <p> The boy cocked his head and smiled . " Hub ? " he said . <p> Edna was about to argue with the old fool , right there in front of strangers . This was good money here , their money , but it 'd do no good to argue with him now-she knew that-not with his foolish mind made up . She put the bowls back in the truck and got behind , the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . The truck screamed when she started it . Then she turned around and drove down the ruts , leaving the boy and girl standing there in a swirl of dogs and exhaust . <p> When they turned onto the Watson Road , Edna said , " Have you gone completely crazy , or are you only halfway there ? That 's three thousand dollars ' worth of dogs . " <p> " Ai n't mine , " he said . <p> They were a mile down the road , just crossing White Oak Creek , when he told her to pull over and shut the truck off . The trees were still big along the creek because the law would n't let loggers cut there . The darkness was deep , and it smelled cool and rich . <p> " Now , " he said , and his head cocked like he heard something . " Them 's my dogs . " <p> She listened to the breeze high in the leaves and to the water hissing across rocks in the creek . If there had been some hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Coy thought that the woods would go on forever and that they would go on forever , too , back when a whole forest of tall trees held the stars higher in the sky . <p> " Forty years , " he said . " It ai n't a long time to kill every bear and cut every tree . " <p> She nodded . " It 's enough , " she said . <p> They stared through the windshield at the darkness . " I done my share of it , " Coy said . " Must 've cut a million trees , but I ca n't work no more , Edna . I ca n't hear the dogs no more . And there ai n't no woods no more . Only little patches , like this , to make a man miserable . " <p> Well , it was true . He could n't work , and he knew he could n't work . She started the truck and pulled onto the road . The woods glided past , and she could smell the soft , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Coy said . <p> She did not look at him . She did n't need to . He was familiar to her in every wrinkle and pain . He was hers to have and to hold , but it was as if her hand had closed on sand , and the harder she squeezed , the quicker it ran between her fingers . <p> The leaves were turning yellow already . Another winter would be on them soon . Well , so what if he did n't want his own dogs ? That was fine with her , but to leave them at some stranger 's house , well , it was foolish-a waste of money they did n't have . just when she thought she knew the exact shape of the old fool 's foolishness , here it had gone and taken on a new shape , and now she was going to have to figure him out all over again . <p> Tomorrow . She would come back tomorrow and gather them up and sell them . <p> " Do you hear ? " <p> She stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cicadas were working themselves up into crazy rhythms . No , she did not hear old hounds running through the woods of a deaf man 's memory . She did not hear their mournful cries when they struck trail , did not hear how their music got sadder and more desperate the closer they got to what they wanted . What was it , she had always wondered , what was it that drove them to chase after things that made them seem so unhappy ? <p> Coy was leaning his head out the window , listening . He was out there somewhere , spinning on ahead of her . She wanted to cry his name , wanted to say , " Coy , what 's happening to you ? Where is the man I used to know ? " She wanted to bring him back to her , wanted to have him and to hold him , but getting what you wanted-holding it in your hand or in your heart-getting what you wanted only meant that it was going to be gone from your life forever . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven this road , but all of a sudden she was n't sure if it wound left or right . Left , she thought left , but she slowed down anyway , just in case there might be a surprise for her up ahead . <p>
