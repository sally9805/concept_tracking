THE STATION WAGON HAD EASED intO the COttage drive a little past three . The man and woman got out , each turning to reach back for the child . The storekeeper across the highway noted them and wondered if he could recall them from the summer before . He concluded that they were new , and when after an hour they came across the road in the sun-glare to shop , he proved to be right . <p> " We 've rented from the Strattons . Just for this weekend , " the man said . " Do you know them ? " <p> " Sure thing , " the storekeeper said . <p> " How 's fishing ? " <p> " Catching some , but mainly far out . " <p> " I 'll stick to shore . You got minnows ? " <p> " Some . Take a look . " <p> A barrel stood in the cool back of the store , past the end of the glass-front counters and the shelves loaded with canned goods and specialty items . A net hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs ? " the child asked . <p> " Have n't noticed any today , " the storekeeper said . " In the hot weather , they mainly stay out in the swamp . " <p> The woman laughed . " He means rubber ones , I think . The kind you can blow up and float in the water . " <p> " You 'll have to go up the road for those . K Mart , maybe . " <p> " So you 'll have to wait , " the woman said to the boy , who looked un= certain about it . <p> The boy 's name was Cooper . He was not her son . His mother was her brother 's wife , only her brother had left for other parts , somewhere out West , and remarried . Had anyone told him his ex-wife was in the hospital , gravely ill ? Had anyone told him the mother of his son was ill ? <p> Questions like these might float around in the atmosphere , might come in on the repetitive waves of thought . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packard , who was neither the boy 's father nor the woman 's husband , sat on the porch and watched the sea . He had already brought poles up from the lower level and strung the lines , but still he made no move toward going out . He let the sea sound , the salt air , invade him , like water permeating dry fabric . He had brought work with him , but he did not think about it . He wondered if they had done the right thing . The Strattons ' unexpected offer was hard to refuse . A weekend in their cottage at Ocean Isle . But there was this illness . The tide was out , and the waves reached the long sand beach in a slow measure , unfurling , retreating , but not breaking open . The water seemed like satin-glossy , swelling and shrinking . <p> Inside , Elsa was taking a few staples from the store out of sacks , stocking the cabinets and refrigerator . " I 'm sorry , " she had told Packard back in Eltonville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nobody else to keep him . " <p> " Are n't you going to fish ? " her voice floated through the open window . <p> " Later . Where 's Cooper ? " <p> " Watching TV . " <p> Packard snorted . " If I had a kid . . . . " <p> " You 'd what ? " <p> " I 'd take the damn box five miles out and dump it . " <p> " There 'd just be more more more . You 'd never stop them . Nothing will . " <p> " But do n't you watch it , too ? " He had n't learned a lot about her . <p> " Some things . Do n't you ? " <p> " Mighty few . " <p> " But some . " <p> He dropped the argument . Reading was always Packard 's preference . Only there was too much to read . <p> " TV and dinosaurs , " he muttered , half to himself . " Just proves he 's a normal kid . " He was learning about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definitive sound . " I have to drive up for more groceries . Are you coming ? " <p> " I 'm staying . See if they 're biting . " <p> " Cooper ! Come and shop . " She had to call twice . <p> There was a burst from the spare bedroom . Packard turned to look . Cooper was a nice brown little boy , about seven . He went to grammar school , not the high school where Packard worked as assistant administrator . " TV is a tool , " he often lectured students . " An educational crutch . It 's not for you to devote your life to . If you 're not learning anything , switch it off . Go play basketball . " <p> " You 're not making a dent , I bet , " Elsa told him . <p> " Maybe not . Maybe some of them listen . " <p> Cooper was barefoot . " Better put your sneakers on , " Packard advised . Elsa agreed . " You 'll have dinosaurs stepping on your toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't at the same time . <p> Packard dropped his magazine and went inside . He helped Cooper tie his sneakers . They were red with a white rubber rim around the soles . Cooper ran back in the room to get something . Before he came back , Packard kissed the back of Elsa 's neck . " We 're going to get through it somehow , " he assured her . <p> She made a face . " Just like Margery to get sick . " <p> Elsa and Cooper stopped at the fish market for shrimp , in case Packard did n't catch anything . Elsa had a feeling he would n't . She kept her eyes on the road with almost too much concentration , frown between her eyes . Margery was no kin to her was what she was thinking . Whatever Cooper said , she answered yes or no . He rode beside her , his feet stuck straight out . <p> " Wish you taught at the school , " Packard had told her . She worked at the county tax office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I would n't try to control those brats for anything , " had been her answer . <p> Cooper , fallen silent , kept pulling at a rip in the vinyl upholstery . " Do n't , " Elsa told him , twice . Then she slapped his hand . He tried not to cry . " I 'm sorry , Cooper , " she said . " Where 's Mommy ? " he asked , though he knew very well . She told him again : " She 's in the hospital . She 'll be all right . " He said nothing , his round little face shut up tight . <p> Cooper trailed Elsa through the supermarket without saying anything , but when they had hauled the sacks to the car , he said , " K Mart . " <p> Oh , Lord , Elsa thought , and supposed that she had to . Women her age , twenty-eight , were supposed to have kids already . She sometimes wondered why she had n't . It was that early marriage , maybe . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool to motherhood . But now she had to buy a dinosaur . <p> They came in large plastic envelopes , each with a colored picture of the one waiting within . Cooper chose a brontosaurus . The next step was the filling station to have it blown up . Elsa knew she had to do that too and pulled in under a Texaco sign . <p> The attendant spread the large expanse of rubber on the pavement . He found the entry valve and plugged in the air nozzle . A hissing sound continued for several minutes , and when he turned around he said , " My God ! " <p> Elsa was astounded , and Cooper was delighted . The creature , in all its painted glory , soared in the air above them . Cooper jumped up to encircle its lofty neck , but could n't reach it . It smiled down with a stupid lizard grin . All lizards grin , thought Elsa , and looking at the massive feet , the tail big as a tree trunk , wondered how to get it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it now . He was jumping with delight and looking ready to wet his pants , though he said he did n't need to go . <p> The attendant helped Elsa squeeze the creature through the back : a tight fit . Not much more than a boy himself , he was obviously having fun . They laid it on its side . They had to bend and fold the tail across its back . When Elsa and Cooper climbed back into the car , the tiny head protruded over the seatback between them . Elsa shoved at it . A glance showed her not only that lizard grin but eyelashes painted on . One eye was staring into hers . " It has funny ears , " said Cooper . " What you got there , sport ? " Packard wanted to know . But this was just as they started unloading . " Jesus , " he next remarked . <p> " You mighty right , " said Elsa . They set the dinosaur upright on the lawn and stood staring at it . <p> Like all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters on the second floor , utility and storage space below . There was no way to get the dinosaur up the outside stairs . They circled to the beach side and managed to get him onto the porch . He filled most of the floor space , huge feet planted , tail hanging out the door , foolish head nudging the ceiling . " His name is Billy , " said Cooper . <p> It was getting late . " We 'll have to hurry if you want to swim , " said Packard . <p> Cooper said that Billy did n't want to swim . <p> " I thought that 's why you bought him , " Packard said to Elsa . " Do n't ask me why I bought him , " said Elsa . " Forty damn dollars ' worth of rubber monster . " <p> " Come on , Coop , " said Packard . " Let 's take him in the water for a ride . Let 's see if Billy can swim . " <p> Elsa went inside . She heard Cooper say again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next afternoon , however , they had all gone swimming with Billy , and they had walked with Billy on the beach . They had tied a rope around the rise of his neck , which was painted like the rest of him all gray , green , and orange . They had pulled and nudged him along . His mighty tail wagged across the sand . He was light but also awkward . He towered over them , grinning at people , grinning at the sea . People pointed and laughed . Some had taken pictures . <p> The three had had lunch in the cottage . Packard had even caught a fish . And though he and Elsa had made love in the night , it had n't been the best ever . Elsa kept dreaming about dinosaurs . " I 'm fucking with the damned things , " she confided . " Better stop it , " Packard advised . But now it was afternoon . One thing they had always agreed on : love in the afternoon was the best . Since they did n't live together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it was afternoon . <p> " All parents have this problem , " Elsa said . " We ca n't send him out to swim . He might drown . " <p> " Just leave him with the TV , " said Packard . <p> She laughed . " It 's what you 're against . " <p> " Maybe this is all it 's good for . " <p> " He 'll see more sex on that than if he sat and watched . " <p> " Do n't be so graphic , " Packard said . He was squeamish . He did n't like talking about sexy behavior . When he got going he would let out little cries and whispers . Elsa liked to talk dirty , once she got into it . <p> Out on the porch , Cooper was sitting in the swing with the dinosaur beside him on the floor . He had to hold it by one arm to keep it from sliding away . He was swinging and singing something tuneless . <p> " Let 's give it up , " Elsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though someone else , invisible , had spoken . For desire was with them now , knocking about in the blood . For the first time since they arrived , the phone rang . <p> It took them both a while to quit looking at it and answer it . They both knew why . <p> Elsa finally went to it . All she said was Yes and No and Of course . She straightened up and bit her lip . <p> Packard went out and sat in a rocker near Cooper and the dinosaur . " Did Billy like his swim ? " he asked . <p> " He 'd rather walk with us , " said Cooper . <p> Packard forbade himself even to look at the creature . He thought maybe he hated all this dinosaur craze as much as he hated TV . It 's off the same bolt of cloth , he thought . <p> He had an inspiration . " If I give you ten dollars , will you go across the street and buy something ? " <p> " Like what ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , or one thing for us both . Will you ? " <p> " What about Billy ? " <p> " Something for Billy , too . I 'll look after him . I promise . " He held out the money . <p> Cooper put Billy in the living room and left for the store . " Look both ways when you cross the road , " Packard advised . Then he turned to Elsa . " When he comes back in , we 'll hear the door . " <p> " You hope , " said Elsa , but she was already ahead of him , hurrying to the bedroom , shedding her jeans , her blouse . <p> " A quickie , " she said , head flung back against pillows , eagerly and happily laughing . She was stripped to her bikini briefs and bra , leaving them for Packard , who liked taking them off . <p> He turned her and smoothed her ; he murmured to her . He really was good at it . Now he was over her once again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest hair . ( " You 've got brown hair , " she had told him the first time she saw it . " Do you dye all this ? " ) Her firm fingers explored the black thicket below . She watched his sex emerge to stand all white and sturdy , ready to lean right in . " Ooh ! " said Elsa . " Oh-ohhh ! " <p> " Better than nothing at all , " Packard said , when the short time passed . They lay a little apart and listened . " He should be back by now , " said Elsa . " The door squeaks , " Packard assured her : " We 'll be certain to hear him . " <p> But the whole house was silent . <p> From the beginning , they had known what they wanted . Packard , still in his twenties , felt he had plenty of time to think about marriage , for the truth was he was hesitant about it . He took responsibility too seriously . At the high school , he was always fretting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their interminable demands . But he liked sex . <p> He had run into Elsa , literally run into her at the door of the gym one night before a basketball game . She was hurrying not to miss the start . She had Cooper with her , and her sister-in-law was trailing behind . She had bumped straight into him , though it would n't have happened if he had n't been looking back over his shoulder and talking with someone . " Oh , sorry . " " My fault . " Packard had stepped on Cooper 's foot . Cooper was saying , " You hurt my foot . " <p> Later , Packard went and found them . " Is your little boy all right ? " " He 's not mine , " said Elsa , " but he 's all right . I 've got no kids , " she amiably continued . " I know how to keep out of that , " she went on , not exactly without knowing what she was saying , for he had attracted her from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lean in the bargain . Umm , she was already thinking . <p> Elsa had run off and got married at sixteen , but had her fill of it in less than a year . She discovered the unconscious selfishness of men , and furthermore that she had no intention of getting used to it . She left as abruptly as she had come ; he had to claim desertion . So that was over with . But she liked sex . <p> Was n't there just enough time for a little more ? She pressed her thigh into Packard 's , touching again , starting him up . There was a persistent whisper in her mind , like a little night wind . <p> " What was that phone call about ? " asked Packard . She had to tell him . " Margery . " <p> " Better ? " he asked , turning his head to her on the pillow , frowning when she did n't answer , then finally said , " No . " <p> He came up suddenly on his elbow . " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did n't you say ? " <p> But he knew why she had n't and that it was the same reason why he , when the call came , had gone out on the porch . <p> " Jesus , " she flared up , " I ca n't do miracles . " <p> But what miracle did she mean ? She did n't know ; she only felt accused . <p> He flung back the fold of sheet he had drawn partway over his legs and , rising off the bed , began grabbing for his clothes . <p> " Do n't you realize . . . ? " <p> A fight was in the air . They had been careful , all these past months , never to quarrel ; all they wanted was the same thing , they assured each other-nothing to quarrel over . Now he was going to accuse her . She knew it . <p> But he did n't , unless his sudden cutoff of feeling , his urgency , was an accusation . <p> " I 'll go get him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there , " she flung after him , making him turn back . <p> " What on earth do you mean ? " <p> " I mean that he has n't come back , so he must have gone somewhere else . " <p> " God in heaven , " Packard said , and plunged through the living room . He ran to the top of the steps that led to ground level . <p> Cooper , she thought , I 'm doing something to you . But then , Margy wanted us to take you . What could she do with him , was what she said . And now I 'm supposed to be . . . What ? What was she supposed to be ? She remembered the exact words of the call , though she had n't told Packard : " We 'd urge you to come as soon as possible . She 's not improving . " But Packard had n't wanted to hear . It 's why he 'd gone to the porch . And they both knew it . Yes , both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in blue jeans and faded T-shirt walked into the yard . <p> " Oh , hello , " said Packard . <p> " Hi yer doin ' . Say , is one of you over here named Billy ? " <p> " No . . . well , yes and no . He 's a . . . well , he 's our . . . relative . " <p> " A kid was over to the store . He was talking about Billy . " <p> " Where 's he now ? " <p> " He just struck out . " <p> " Struck out ? " <p> " Preston over there , he come to the conclusion the kid was with you . But he just was n't sure . " <p> " You mean he left ? For where ? " He was gazing hard into a country face , sun-reddened , with sun-scaled skin and eyebrows speckled gray under a cap bill . <p> " Beats me , if he ai n't here . " <p> Packard was stricken . He stood fined on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cement . Elsa , all dressed , came out beside him . " Do n't tell me he 's lost . " He turned on her in something like the start of an outburst , but then said hurriedly , " We 're going to the store . " <p> They crossed the road together . <p> Preston had no more to offer than what they 'd heard already . " Just struck out . Kept talking about Billy . Are you Billy ? " <p> " No , " said Packard . ' <p> A woman came from the back of the store . She was well-informed . " How come you letting him out like that ? How old is he ? " <p> " Seven , " said Elsa . <p> " You ought not to_the let him out like that . " <p> " He was supposed to come right back , " said Packard . <p> " He said something about his mother , too , " said the storekeeper . " You his mother ? He was talking about her and Billy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode up and down the highway . They stopped at every business to inquire about Cooper . They . described him so much they knew him by heart . The last phrase was always " red tennis shoes . " <p> They went back to the beach house and called the police : Then they sat and tried not to look at each other . It seemed like the first bad afternoon in Eden . <p> It was after dark when a car pulled up in the yard . Packard and Elsa rushed to the stair . An elderly couple were alighting , and here came Cooper . <p> " We should have stopped and called , " they said . " But we decided to hurry back instead . " <p> The story was simple enough . They had filled up with gas at Preston 's store , and Cooper had heard them say they were heading to Eltonville . He wanted to see his mother and tell her about Billy . She was sick , and he thought it would be good for her to know . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clear because everybody started talking at once . Did they notice him there before they heard the radio announcement or afterward ? The man judged that Cooper had got in at the store-only place they 'd stopped for gas . They 'd turned right around to come back . And then the radio . . . . But thereafter all was said , and never to be understood-there was Cooper , standing so small and so separate from Packard and herself . Separate from the others , too . So separate he was almost nameless ; like a kid without a name ; Elsa thought . She cried out , " Cooper ! " and suddenly closed the distance : She threw her arms around him and burst into tears . Cooper hugged her back . <p> " Golly , sport , " said Packard . " You sure scared us silly . " <p> " How 's Billy ? " Cooper asked . <p> The elderly couple said they were glad to have been a help . It was their little adventure , they said . They gave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving his , said " we " - " We live at , " etcetera . Letting out they were n't married seemed not quite the thing . Probably he would never see them again , except maybe in the grocery : <p> In the dew-damp early night , the three of them stood in the dark , waving good-bye to the nice people as they backed away and moved onto the highway . <p> Then Packard and Elsa turned and followed Cooper up the stairs to where the brontosaurus waited in the living room . <p> " We 're leaving now , " Packard said firmly . " We 've got to get to Margery . " <p> Packard and Elsa never went away together again . Elsa kept remembering what she had felt about Cooper , how she had seen and seen and seen again , in her mind 's vivid memory , the hurt face when she slapped him , the firm little shoulders trudging ahead , eagerly leading her down the aisles at K Mart , the two smudges of blood on his legs from mosquito bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her inward cry that awful afternoon , " Come back , my darling , please . " It had all surprised her . She had never thought of Cooper as her darling . She never cried , did n't know she could . Once , long ago , she had cried . It was not long after her mother died and was something about some roller skates , but what , she could n't remember . She thought it did n't matter anymore . <p> Margery did n't die ; she just almost did . <p> Elsa got married and moved to Oklahoma . She had children one after another . She even had twins . Packard got a better job up in Maryland , and he got married too . Soon he had a son . He would stare at him in loving amazement . <p> But wherever they were , Packard and Elsa always thought of Cooper as their first child . Neither knew that the other thought this . One day Packard drove down to Raleigh on school business . Being near Eltonville , he went over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great boy , rather brusque but friendly . He did n't remember much about Ocean Isle , only going off somewhere in a car . But when Packard mentioned Billy , he grinned . " He stayed blown up for a long time , " said Cooper , " but the air finally faded right out of him . " He turned to his mother . " It was that dinosaur I had once , " he explained . <p> " Oh , yes , " Margery said . " It went down little at the time . There was nothing left but one foot . " Cooper was laughing . " That one big foot just would n't go away . " <p> Packard wanted to tell it to Elsa . <p>
