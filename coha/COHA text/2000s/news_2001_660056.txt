<p> One day last October , South African AIDS activist Zackie Achmat arrived in Thailand on a flight from Johannesburg , drove to a pharmaceutical laboratory , and handed over $ 1,200 . In return , he was given 5,000 purple-and-white capsules of a medicine that would have cost $ 51,500 at home . Mr. Achmat broke the law when he brought the medicine back with him . The American drug giant Pfizer holds a patent on the medicine Achmat carried in his overnight bag - Fluconazole , used to combat AIDS-related diseases . And the cheap substitute was a generic copycat . " But people were dying across the country and doctors were saying they could not afford to prescribe the right medicines , " Achmat recalls . " We wanted to set a moral example , and put the right to life and health before profit . We do n't want to be smugglers - this is the government 's job to do . " The South African government can not do it because Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies will not let it . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceutical firms challenged a 1997 law that allowed health authorities to bypass drug patents and import cheaper generic medicines , so the government agreed not to use it until the courts ruled . Next week , the case comes before a South African court . In a country where 400,000 people have died of AIDS-related illnesses since 1997 and hundreds of thousands more are predicted to share their fate , activists say that drug companies must relax their patent rights . In the glare of international campaigns for cheaper medicine , the big pharmaceutical companies are now scrambling to cut the prices they charge in African countries for HIV/AIDS drugs . But they insist that without patent protection , and the profits that come with it , they would have no incentive to spend millions of dollars on inventing new and more-effective cures . " Patent protection is fundamental to continued research and development in these areas , " says Phil Thomson , spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , one of the biggest drug companies in the world . " We have to aim to protect our patents across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague to face humanity since the Middle Ages ( the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa has already killed 17 million people ) , that aim is increasingly controversial . Retroviral medicines have been shown to lower the fatality rate of patients diagnosed with AIDS , but only rich patients in rich countries can generally afford them . ' Wealth vs. health ' campaign Oxfam , the British-based development agency , this month launched a worldwide campaign to cut the cost of anti-AIDS drugs and other expensive medicines that treat diseases common to developing nations , accusing pharmaceutical companies and rich-country governments of waging " an undeclared drugs war against the world 's poorest countries . " " The balance has skewed too far towards corporate wealth rather than public health , " said Oxfam 's director of policy , Justin Forsyth , as he launched the campaign . Feeding the controversy is an Indian firm , Cipla , which has just signed a deal to sell its generic anti-AIDS cocktail to the Nobel prize-winning group Medecins Sans Frontieres for use in Africa . The patented cocktail costs between $ 10,000 and $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its substitute at cost : $ 350 a year . A Kenyan orphanage last week took up Cipla 's offer . " Enough is finally enough , " said Chris Ouma , a doctor who works with AIDS patients in Nairobi . " We are beginning to wonder who is more deadly to the people of sub-Saharan Africa . Is it HIV or the businessmen who have their briefcases full of patent applications ? " India does not recognize pharmaceutical patents , so Cipla 's production line is legal . But the Bombay company 's efforts to export its medicine have run into trouble . A deal to sell cheap retrovirals to Uganda and Ghana , for example , fell through last year when Glaxo Wellcome warned Cipla that it was violating patent rights . The threats angered Amar Lulla , Cipla 's joint managing director . " This is not a normal commercial situation where we talk about commerce and patents , " he says . " In Africa ... they 're talking about a whole generation being wiped out . Something has to be done . " What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug companies agree , includes a range of measures from AIDS education and prevention to strengthening fragile health systems . But lowering the price of medicines is one part of the strategy . And there is nothing like competition to bring prices down . In Brazil , for example , Merck is currently negotiating a discounted price for its anti-AIDS drug Efavirenz , in the face of the government 's threat to start manufacturing the drug itself . " We want to be able to provide Brazil with medicines at an affordable price , " says Gregory Reaves , Merck spokesman . " We want to resolve this matter in discussions . " GSK is taking a similar approach , announcing last week that it would expand its nine-month-old offer to sell cut-price retrovirals to African nongovernmental organizations , as well as to governments . " Faster progress is needed , " said GSK chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier at a press conference last week in London . By the summer , says GSK spokesman Mr. Thomson , the company will go further , after a review of its pricing policy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GSK 's Accelerated Access program for cheap AIDS drugs has been slow to take off , with only three African countries signing up for limited quantities . Governments have complained that negotiations with GSK have been lengthy and complicated . Nor are these " islands of philanthropy " sufficient , argues Oxfam . The campaigning group is pressing GSK and other pharmaceutical giants to do more , and is also warning that new international trade rules imposed by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) could increase prices for essential drugs by as much as 300 percent in poor countries . New rules in the WTO 's Agreement on Trade Related Property Rights ( TRIPS ) , being phased in until 2006 , give drug companies 20 years of patent protection in all member states - a period that critics say is excessive . The WTO rules do allow governments to override patents in cases of national emergency or extreme urgency , and to import or manufacture rival drugs . Brazil has invoked this rule to manufacture inexpensive anti-AIDS medicines . But what constitutes a " national emergency " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the US government - have taken a narrow view of when exceptions should be allowed . At the request of the pharmaceutical industry , for example , Washington has filed a complaint with the WTO against Brazil for threatening to make drugs itself unless the patent holders start making them locally and cheaply within three years of filing a patent . The United States has also formally threatened trade sanctions against the Dominican Republic , Thailand , and more than 15 other developing countries unless they abandon manufacturing , exporting , or purchasing generic copies of drugs that American firms have patented . In Africa , Washington has been more lenient since former President Clinton signed an executive order in late 1999 promising not to pursue governments that legalize generic copies of anti-AIDS drugs . US trade officials have been reported as saying the Bush administration will not overturn this policy , despite lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry . They are not likely to extend it , however , which means that Brazil - widely seen as a model of how to fight AIDS - is still under the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent-busting , and bulk buying to save hundreds of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars . Using generic medicines produced at the government-run Far-Manguinhos laboratory , Brazilian doctors have halved the country 's death rate from AIDS-related diseases and cut the number of patients hospitalized with them by 80 percent . A coordinated effort needed Brazil has offered to share its expertise with other countries . Officials from South Africa and Benin have already visited the Far-Manguinhos facility , and only a lack of political will and organization is stopping other countries from doing the same , says Paolo Teixeira , coordinator of Brazil 's anti-AIDS program . " You need to have the government , congress , and society fighting for the same thing , " says Dr. Teixeira . " That is what happened in Brazil . " Bringing drug prices down dramatically is not the whole answer to illness in the third world ; nor , in some cases , is it even part of the answer .

In New Delhi , in the bustling AIDS ward at the All India Institute for Medical Sciences , doctors say only well-to-do patients can afford the full treatment . " The middle-class persons , the drivers , the maids , and the lower-middle-class persons , buy the drug a little at a time and often they stop taking it , " says a junior doctor . " Most of the patients , they can not afford the drug at all . " Even so , charging American or European prices in countries where many people live on barely $ 1 a day clearly does not make sense , say health officials . " The drug companies are increasingly making concessions to the fact that prices are a real issue , " says Sophia Tickell , one of the leaders of Oxfam 's campaign . " Very , very hardheaded patent enforcement is going to soften . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
