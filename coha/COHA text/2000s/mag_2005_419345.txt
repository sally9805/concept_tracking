Dropping the most popular model from a company 's lineup can never be an easy decision , but when the replacement is better than the original , letting go is easy . At least that 's my take after a recent test of the new Pursuit 2570 Center Console . Legendary Marine provided the boat for my test , and as we idled away from its state-of-the-art facility in Destin , Fla. , I had the opportunity to check out this great-looking fish boat that replaces the builder 's 24 . Pursuit is known for its meticulous attention to detail and that commitment is evident on the 2570 . There are precise covering board cutouts in the raised diamond nonskid , hatches that seal tightly without the slightest squeak and wiring harnesses that would make electrical engineers drool with envy . This 24 is built with uncompromising quality , similar to other high-end fish boats like the Regulator 24FS and the EdgeWater 245 CC . This Pursuit is for fishing , but it does n't sacrifice family-friendly creature comforts . Forward bow seats double as roomy storage compartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubles as another comfortable seat . The 92-quart port box is insulated and drains overboard , while the starboard companion comes without a liner so it will hold odd-shaped gear like an anchor float or a downrigger . There is plenty of room to stand up here to fight a hot fish and the recessed bowrail provides security when seas get lumpy . Behind the oversized leaning post is the command center for all the angling action . It includes rod holders , a tool and lure rack , tackle storage and a 32-gallon livewell with acrylic lid . The well is finished with blue gel coat based on findings by the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution that show baitfish are more content when near a natural color . Rounding out the fishing features are the transom rigging station , cutting board , insulated 40-gallon fish box cooler and freshwater washdown . Cockpit coaming bolsters , a raw-water washdown , rod racks and rod holders are all standard . Our test boat was powered with a pair of 150-hp Yamaha four-stroke out-boards . Top speed was 51.3 mph , but by throttling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were able to make 27.2 mph while only burning 10.2 gph . That converts to a range of 312 nautical miles , a welcome figure with today 's skyrocketing pump prices . We could n't quite plane the boat on just one outboard , but I 'm sure that will be possible once the motors are broken in . Thanks to its aggressive , modified deep-V hull and sharp deadrise , the 2570 rode as softly as the famous sugar-white sand of the Gulf of Mexico . Acceleration was immediate in the rolling swells that greeted us and the boat was very responsive in tight turns . It produced a clean wake at trolling speeds and visibility was unhindered at the helm . In short , the Pursuit 2570 was a pleasure to drive .
