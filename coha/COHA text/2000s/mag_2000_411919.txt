Landlocked Scouts harness the wind-and fly . // Tethered in a trapeze , Curtis Blumer , 12 , flew across the Oklahoma prairie last July . The wind blew , the water splashed and Curtis howled as he " hiked out " - skimming the lake 's surface , hanging off the sailboat 's windward side to keep it from flipping . " Nothing beats hiking out ! " he declared . Photograph Christian Hook , left , " hiking out " on the trapeze with sailing instructor Josh Stephens . // Different Kind of Hike just 15 years earlier , the only hiking here at Zink Scout Ranch , a 34,000-acre spread near Tulsa , involved rugged boots and dusty trails . A sailboat on the ranch 's Hominy Creek would have looked as out of place as a cowboy stringing barbed wire on a cruise ship . That changed after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers closed the floodgates on Skiatook Reservoir in 1990 . The dammed up river created a 13,690-acre lake with 160 miles of shoreline that gave Hominy Creek a big bulge-and gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , Zink Aquatic Sports Center had sprung up on the prairie and the Zink Ranch bunkhouse had turned into a base of sailing operations for 40 kids a week , eight weeks a year . ( See " Know Before You Go " sidebar . ) The chance to sail everything from single-sail 14-footers to multisail 22-footers to speedy catamarans draws landlubbers to the lake summer after summer . " It 's my second year , " said Curtis , a Second Class Scout in Tulsa 's Troop 58 . Tulsa twins Robert and Thomas Carlson , 14 , marked their fourth sailing summer in a row at Zink . Morning to Midnight Sail And its no wonder why : The weeklong course offers sailing , sailing and more sailing . After the first day 's swim tests , counselors take Scouts on a direct line to the sailboats . First Class Scout Thomas Carlson said he liked that intensity better than other camps he 'd attended . " Usually you have to sit in class and figure out what to do first " he explained . " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail anywhere . " First come basic lessons in knots , rigging , safety and more . Then the guys hit the water-literally . The sailors-in-training practice capsizing and recovery in the smaller boats , the 14-foot Capris . Photograph SAILOR SPEAK Get a line on sailing terms . Here 's a primer : Bow : boat 's front , Stern : boat 's back . Port : boat 's left side . Starboard : boat 's right side . Main sail : larger sail behind the mast . Mast : vertical pole that sails attach to . leeward : side farthest from the wind . Windward : side closest to the wind . Catamaran : boat with parallel twin hulls . Trapeze : harness that hangs from mast and allows sailor to hang overboard . PFD : Personal flotation device ( life jacket . Wear one  --  or do n't get on the water . // Tests passed , the Scouts spend the remainder of the week honing their new skills . Each day , they sail more and more hours , roaming farther and farther across the windswept reservoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 to start rigging so we 're on the water when the wind comes up , " Curtis said . " There 's really good wind here early in the mornings . " By the last full day of camp , those winds blow beginners 10 miles a day Advanced sailors go even farther . They sail the 22-foot long Catalinas all the way to the distant north end of the long and narrow lake.It 's a trip that may not be completed until midnight . Robert found he liked sailing a long-range Catalina better than a smaller boat . It had a little to do with the boat 's ability to carry a bigger crew . With four or five guys , everyone took turns at different chores such as steering and sail-handling . But mostly it was better because , he says , " I could bring along some food . " Man Overboard ! While long , hot days on the water can make a guy hungry , no one complains . Everyone 's too busy having fun sailing . Stephen Davis , 14 , discovered his favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scout from Broken Arrow 's Troop 99 first took over sail-handling duties , the boat flipped . Some guys might be scared about such a thing , thinking that their boat might now sink . But that 's why the Scouts practiced capsizing and recovery at the start : To understand these boats float rightside up or down and that they can get them turned upright , then be on their way So Stephen 's idea of what makes sailing fun ? " Capsizing ! " Thomas Carlson said sailors such as himself preferred keeping their boat sails out of the water and full of air . That way , they could spend more time hiked out . " You 're leaning way out and surf ing right off the water , " he explained . " The sun is bright , and the lake is just below you , and it is just beautiful . " Jerrad Brown , 13 , agreed . Then again , the Life Scout from Sand Springs , Okla. , Troop 507 liked everything about his time on the water . " I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlubbers near and far , Zink Aquatic Sports Center lets them do exactly that . Again and again . Photograph // <p>
