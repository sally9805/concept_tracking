The GENDER GAP that once existed in teen alcohol use is closing , according to a study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University . In 1991 , 31% of boys and 22% of girls in 10th grade engaged in BINGE DRINKING , defined as having five or more drinks in a row . In 1999 , 34% of boys and 31% of girls were binge drinkers . Though an early , eye-popping stat from the study  --  that underage drinkers consume 25% of all the nation 's alcohol  --  turned out to be overstated ( it 's actually only half that ) , the problem is still huge : more than 5 million HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are binge drinkers .
