<p> Back in his preteen days in Milwaukee , Bruce Weber had surgery to remove polyps from his throat . <p> His mother still worries , because the doctor advised Weber , now 48 , not to enter a profession that required much public speaking or yelling . <p> And maybe his mother should worry . One of Weber 's basketball players at the University of Illinois , Deron Williams , says that Weber has two volumes  --  loud and louder . <p> Weber 's everyday speaking voice is so piercing that the Illini assistants wonder why he bothers closing his office door . Everyone can still hear every word he says . <p> Weber 's voice comes from the place his unusual coaching journey began  --  his blue-collar childhood in Milwaukee . A career that started as an assistant high school coach and fifth-grade teacher has taken Weber to the top of the collegiate coaching profession . No. 1-ranked Illinois ( 25-0 ) is the only remaining undefeated team in Division I men 's college basketball . <p> The Illini play No. 20 Wisconsin on Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the regular season . The driving force behind the team is Weber , who is in his second year in Champaign after a long journey up the coaching ladder . <p> Much of Weber 's competitiveness through that time can be traced to his father , Lou , who worked a day job at a factory and a night job with the Milwaukee Park District . Lou wore a hearing aid , and the five Weber children needed to scream to get his attention . <p> " That 's the way that my father was , " David Weber , the youngest of the five , said in a telephone interview . " My father had a hard time hearing , so everything in our house was pretty loud . " <p> The Weber family lived in a three-bedroom house , shared one bathroom and had dinners that David Weber described as battles for food . Lou Weber coached junior high basketball and was known to call timeouts to scream at his sons to be in the proper defensive stances . <p> Bruce was known as the most competitive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his health . Weber ca n't quite remember the numbers , but he said he was taken to the emergency room either 17 times by the time he was 14 or 14 times by his 17th birthday . One entire summer he wore a body cast after unknowingly cracking a vertebra in his back . But thanks to his father , he knew only one volume and one speed . <p> " He was pretty intense , " Bruce Weber said . " He drove us all . He had a passion for life . A passion for athletics . " <p> Lou Weber , who died of a heart attack in the late 1980 's , drove all of his children into education . He also took them to Marquette to watch Al McGuire 's Friday and Saturday night practices , which McGuire ran to ensure that his players were not out causing trouble . <p> Bruce Weber did n't have the athletic talent to play sports at Wisconsin-Milwaukee , from which he graduated in 1978 . But he did catch on as an assistant basketball coach at two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college coaching came partly because David played basketball at Wisconsin-Milwaukee . <p> The Wisconsin-Milwaukee coach , Bob Gottleib , called David Weber one of his favorite players ever and Lou Weber one of the best parents he ever dealt with . Gottlieb recalled David Weber requesting to come out of the second half of a blowout his redshirt freshman year because he had already scored 29 points and did not want to appear selfish to his veteran teammates . <p> At the same time , Bruce Weber was trying to crack the college coaching ranks as a graduate assistant and had applied to hundreds of graduate schools . So when he asked Gottlieb if he knew Gene Keady , then the coach at Western Kentucky , Gottlieb recommended Weber without hesitation , even though he did n't know Weber well . <p> " It was just a crazy thing , " Weber said in an interview in his office Friday . " I 'd applied to hundreds of schools . I did n't know any better . " <p> Keady hired Weber as a 22-year-old graduate assistant , making $2,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now an Illinois assistant , took turns cooking dinner . Weber said they were so poor that Nottingham used food stamps and Weber would have been eligible for them if he had applied . <p> But Weber loved the work . And when Keady became Purdue 's coach a year later , he took Weber with him . At Purdue , Weber made $4,000 a year . He went entire winters without putting on the heat in his basement apartment in West Lafayette , Ind. , frequently going home from the office after midnight and sleeping in sweat pants and hooded sweatshirts to stay warm . Weber also had only one lamp to light his apartment , so he would unplug it and carry it from room to room with him . <p> " I did n't know any different , " Weber said . " I was in heaven because I was at a Big Ten school . " <p> That attitude kept Weber plugging away as Keady 's assistant at Purdue for 18 seasons . When people would call and say Weber should position himself for a coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game plan or coordinating the team 's travel to bother . <p> " That 's one of the reasons why it took him so long to get a job , " said Matt Painter , who played at Purdue and was an assistant to Weber at Southern Illinois . " He was n't jumping up and down screaming , ' Look at me . " ' <p> Weber eventually found a head coaching job at Southern Illinois in 1998 . He promptly turned the program around . His teams had winning records in all five of his seasons there and he took the Salukis to one National Invitation Tournament and two N.C.A.A tournaments , reaching the Round of 16 in the 2002 N.C.A.A tournament . <p> After Bill Self left Illinois for Kansas in 2003 , the Illini hired Weber . <p> Just as he did during his injury-prone childhood , Weber runs full throttle . He usually eats one meal a day , and throughout the day sips Diet Cokes and munches on generic pretzels that he still buys for 99 cents a box at Smitty 's grocery store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Iowa , Weber asked the assistant coach Jay Price to run across the street from the team hotel because he had forgotten to bring dress socks . When Price crossed paths with Weber upon his return , Weber realized that he had also forgotten his pants . <p> Weber , who is married with three daughters , also admits to visiting a player at a high school and showing up wearing two different shoes . <p> " That 's him , " Price said . " He 's so worried about making recruiting calls and doing this and that , he forgets his pants . " <p> Things have n't always been so lighthearted during Weber 's time in Champaign . The core of players he inherited from Self last season resisted Weber 's motion offense and occasionally maniacal drills , which feature players taking charges or diving to the floor . <p> Weber said guard Dee Brown was the last to buy in , so he sat him down at one point last season and said , " I 'm the boss , and I 'm not leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point came after a particularly grueling practice early in conference play last season , when Weber ran only defensive drills for two hours . <p> " From that practice on , we knew that he was more stubborn than we were , " Ingram said . " We were going to buy in or we were going to be left behind . " <p> The resistance ceased and Brown , one of the nation 's quickest players , thrived down the stretch . The Illini had 10 straight victories to end the regular season , won the Big Ten regular-season title ( their first outright conference championship in 52 years ) and advanced to the Round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament , where they lost to Duke . <p> Illinois took the momentum to this season , blowing out Wake Forest in Champaign on Dec. 1 . The Illini have rolled since . With the potential of playing all its N.C.A.A. tournament games within three hours of Champaign  --  Indianapolis to Chicago to St. Louis  --  Illinois has few doubters inside or outside the program . <p> And those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice will be heard often around the country come March . <p> " He built his career from the ground up , " Keady said . " He 's No. 1 right now because he deserves it .

It was 24-0 , not 25-0 . ( Illinois improved its record to 25-0 on Saturday with a victory over Wisconsin. )
