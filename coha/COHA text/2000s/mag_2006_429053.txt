Perhaps nothing is more telling than the items of clothing a woman chooses to buy , keep , or toss ( not to mention how she stores them ) . What secrets does your closet hold ? // A few months back I attended a benefit luncheon at the home of a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley whose art collection adorned nearly every vertical surface of her Bauhaus house . While freshening up , I was amused to see she had artwork even in her bathroom and , as I then saw , her vault-size closet . I stepped in , ostensibly to examine the painting , and there I experienced a life-changing revelation . At first glance the interior of the closet and its cabinetry of birdseye maple were merely impressive . An Eames bench sat in the center , where one might sit as if resting among exhibits at a costume museum . Cashmere sweaters and scarves , arranged by tonality , were aligned on sliding trays . Segregated sections contained jackets , black-tie gowns , cocktail-parry dresses , business suits , and golfing attire-phalanxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of it hanging on the erect shoulders of identical mahogany hangers , a precision team at the ready for any occasion . And then there was this : four banks of shelves housing four dozen shoe boxes , which had been wrapped in rough hemp mesh and coated with a thin layer of gouache . Affixed to the front of each was a small stainless-steel nameplate , on which appeared the names of the various conceptual artists : Giorgio Armani , Manolo Blahnik , and Jimmy Choo . In smaller type were notes with numbers and letters ; those , I discerned through similar coding found in other parts of her closet , referred to the black-tie , cocktail , and business attire that coordinated with the shoes . This was the temple into which the woman entered to consider the existential question we all face each day : I am what I wear , I wear what I am . Who am I today ? You do n't have to be a psychiatrist to recognize that the matching hangers and labeled shoe boxes were clinical signs of a mental-health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in her 30s , I knew she would never marry . This was clearly someone who was so inflexible she allowed no wrinkles in her life , certainly no man with uncoded shoe boxes . As I made this smug assessment , I had a sudden and terrible realization that my own closet had served for others as an amusing window into my psyche . I could picture it : the overflowing drawers of socks and stockings , long dresses mingling with old blouses and skirts , winter clothes with summer , many of the outfits dangling by one shoulder off skewed plastic and wire hangers . My rack of clothes was far from looking like a precision team ; it was the unruly lineup of people waiting to deplane after a red-eye flight . Under the clothes rack and pushed against the wall were various bags from my latest round of travels , half packed with clean and dirty clothes as well as items I had thought were necessities and turned out not to be . Clearly , anyone would conclude that my life was a mess , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if I was coming or going . My closet was a repository of foibles and fetishes , an archive of my personality and life history . It occurred to me that closet analysis should be part of any psychotherapy sessions with a Freudian . The ego : That would be the clothes representing die private side-say , the comfort clothes a woman wears when she is alone and sick at home with die flu , when she is her essential miserable self . In my case , that would be the oversize fleecewear and the babydoll dress I bought a dozen years ago that reminded me of the babydoll dress I wore when I was 14 and questioned almost nothing told to me . Among the comfort clothes I wear-and I know this will sound sick-are the pink pajamas my mother wore the last week of her life . In that vein , there are also the wool Bavarian slipper socks that were a Christmas present from a friend who died too young , the nightgown I wore the night after my father died , and the six sweaters my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly escaped her clutches and started college a year early . Those were the sweaters I never wore again until my 30s , when I found them stuffed in a cardboard box of old clothes . As for the superego , those are the clean clothes a person wears in public as an adaptation to a social setting , situation , or purpose-the fashions that make a woman look sexy to a suitor , younger at a reunion , or sensibly boring to a future mother-in-law . They are the suits that have already proven their worth during successful interviews and speeches , the clingy top that led to a pleasantly consummated dalliance , the pants that fit after six months of exercise . Often those outfits are advanced front and center . But they are always subject to demotion ; once they fail at their intended purpose , they 're shoved to the back , along with impulse items never worn , whose price tags had once made them irresistible and now remind us how little we value our intelligence . To grow them away only magnifies the stupidity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topmost shelves , squeezed behind uncoded shoe boxes , crammed at the back of drawers , or hidden under a pile of flip-flops and unused running shoes-resides the id . This is the underwear you will have on when you wake up in the ambulance , the permanently stained clothing , and other ghastly things you would disclose only under hypnosis . I tried to rationalize the untidy personality within my closet as complex and not twisted like the wire hangers I got for free from the dry cleaners . If my personality lies in my closet , I further justified , then it is disorganized because I find it impossible to live an orderly life when it is chaos and confusion that serve me best as a writer . Messiness is the impetus , the disarray is the wellspring , even the shameful parts-especially those . I dredge them up and salvage them over and over again . I can not discard clothes if they were gifts , no matter how hideous . To do so would make me feel ungrateful for friendship . The clutter within a closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold nights . That was my excuse , anyway . Until recently . Today , if you were to open my closet door , you would see blouses hung in one section , jackets in another . Long skirts are partitioned from long dresses . One shelf is labeled " long-sleeved tops , " another " short-sleeved tops , " and a third " no sleeves . " The shoes are in shoe caddies or on wire racks , and they are separated by season and function . The drawers contain socks and underwear , even the old ones , folded as nicely as those in fine lingerie stores . The nightgowns are placed in two drawers according to fabric weight . How did I come to see the light ? It was really quite simple and unexpected . My old housekeeper retired and recommended a new one , a woman with common sense and a way to apply it to the interior life of other people . When I returned from one of my travels , I saw that my closet had been transformed . When she presented me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amazed to see how little matching hangers cost . For so little money , a girl can have a precision team at her beck and call . Through such objective orderliness , I saw some of my foibles exposed : six skirts that were almost identical in fabric , color , and length . Why do I buy the same thing over and over again ? What ingrained insecurity or needless pattern does that signify ? I began to pare down and wound up with a dozen bagfuls-the useless jean jackets of my youth , the meaningless impulse buys , the excess of unused baseball caps and T-shirts emblazoned with the names of bookstores , book festivals , writers ' conferences , annual events , cities visited , and tour attractions toured . My housekeeper gladly took those clothes , and for this , I too was grateful . In reducing the chaos , I found what I had misplaced and buried . Among them were my mother 's wedding jacket , a favorite blouse that I wrongfully assumed a girl at a party had stolen , the velveteen vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now husband gave me more than 30 years ago . And that , I realized , is also the kind of discovery I make when writing stories . In wading through the mess , I gradually put aside what is no longer meaningful , what is overused , what is overly sentimental . And what is left is the essentials : both a sense of who I am and memories of what helped me become that way . Sidebar I saw some of my foibles exposed .... Why do I buy the same thing over and over again ? What ingrained insecurity or needless pattern does that signify ?
