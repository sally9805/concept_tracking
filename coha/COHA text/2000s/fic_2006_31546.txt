Chapter One Silver Fork , Oregon Nine months later Abby Maitland rummaged through her bag again . And again . No house keys . Not possible . Not tonight . Oh , please . She leaned her hot forehead against the door of her apartment and tried not to sob . The evening bag yielded up wallet , cell phone , and lipstick . Sheba meowed from inside as if she had n't been fed in weeks . Edgar , the blind date from the bowels of hell , rattled his car keys . " Makes it tough to invite me in for a nightcap , huh ? " His voice was an oily ooze of insinuation . Yeah , jerkwad . I 'd only rather be dipped in boiling lead . She stomped on the words only for the sake of Dovey , her well-meaning coworker who had set up this date . She had freely agreed to spend an evening with this puff-toad , and it was classier to keep her mouth shut . It was n't really a blind date . She 'd met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum in Portland . He 'd seemed promising ; i.e. , nice-looking and articulate . The flirtatious e-mail exchanges had been fun . The first hour of the date had n't been bad . After some wine , though , the illusion of wit and charm had faded . His face went red , he stopped listening to anything she said , his gaze dropped to her chest and stuck . By the time the food had arrived , she'dbeen casting around for a polite escape route . She should have called her car service then and there . She had n't realized how drunk he was until he was driving her home . He 'd scoffed at her offer to drive , of course , macho turd that he was . " I do n't want any more company , " she said , for the eighth time . " And you 've had enough to drink . " " I did knock back a few . Ca n't drive back to Portland like this . You 'll let me stay , wo n't you , dollface ? I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In your dreams , Edgar , " she said . " Get a room . " " Cool idea . Let 's go check into that No-Tell Motel down on the highway . " He swayed toward her . " Cheap , sleazy motels turn me on . " " Nope . " She swayed back , to minimize the stupefying effects of his garlic-and-wine breath . Her landlady lived on the ground floor , but she was eighty , and would not appreciate being dragged from her bed just because Abby could n't keep her purses organized . " Break the kitchen window , " Edgar suggested . He hefted her doorstop , a swirl of driftwood attached to a chunk of petrified wood . " No ! " Abby grabbed the doorstop , staggering under the momentum of Edgar 's enthusiastic downswing . " Do not help ! I 'll deal with this problem myself . In fact , you can go . Now . Please . Feel free . " She fished out her cell phone and punched in the number of her friend Elaine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys . Elaine picked up on the fourth ring . " Abby ? What 's up ? You OK ? " " I 'm fine , " Abby said . " Sorry to call so late , but I was a ditz and locked myself out . I figured you 'd turn the cell off if you were asleep . " " Um , well ... I 'm out . " " You 're what ? " Abby was startled . Shy , homebody Elaine was never out on a Wednesday night . Or any other night , for that matter . " Out . Actually , I 'm sort of , ah ... involved , right now . " Abby 's mouth worked for a moment , but she rallied swiftly . " Really ? Whoo hoo ! Good for you , girlfriend ! I had no idea . " Elaine 's giggle sounded nervous . " It 's been a secret . I just met him recently . But later for that . Are your keys to my house locked in , too ? " " Yup . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath made her gag . She swatted him away . " Edgar , do you mind ? " " Abby , are you in trouble ? Do you want me to call someone ? Like the police ? " Elaine 's voice sharpened . " I can handle the situation , " she assured her friend . " Could you grab the Yellow Pages and find me a locksmith ? " " Coming right up . " Edgar chortled as Abby batted his hand away . He seemed to think they were playing a game , like an unruly dog hanging on to a stick . " Abby ? You still there ? " Elaine asked anxiously . " Hanging in there , " Abby said grimly , rummaging through her bag . " Edgar , do you have a pen ? " Edgar pulled a gold pen out of his pocket . Abby snatched it out of his hand . " Go ahead , Elaine . " " Let 's see , let 's see ... oh , perfect . Night Owl Lock and Safe . It says , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She wrote the number Elaine recited on her thumb . " Call me when you get inside , " Elaine said . " If you do n't call within twenty minutes , I 'm calling the police . " " I 'll call , " Abby soothed . " Be ready to spill juicy details tomorrow . " She broke the connection and eyed Edgar with trepidation . It was going to take some serious , hardcore rudeness to pierce his protective layer of self-absorption . She sighed to herself . How squalid and depressing . Zan was perched on the fence on Lookout Drive , wondering if that high , fast-moving cloud was going to hit the moon , when his phone vibrated . He checked the display . Unknown number . Lockout job . Not tonight . He was in one of his moods . He was better off focusing on neutral things , like the moon on the ocean . The vibration of the phone tickled his thigh . He did n't answer . He did n't feel like hauling his ass back down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His family , for instance . Granddad and his brothers were constantly in his face , which was one of the reasons he was in this funk to begin with . Everybody telling him to change his coping mechanisms , his career , his whole goddamn personality . Just thinking about it was getting him all wound up again . He focused on that smudge of stars on the horizon to chill himself out . Hard to do , when the damn phone kept ringing . Maybe he should phase out locksmithing altogether . He certainly did n't need the money . His computer consulting kept him busy . He kept his locksmith license current only because he enjoyed pitting himself against locks now and then . Besides , he did n't sleep at night . Nights could get long and boring . Sometimes he welcomed something to do . But not tonight . The caller gave up ; the phone went still . He let out a sigh of relief and tried to get back into his groove , blissing out on the pulsing surge of the surf . Moonlit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , clear night . Rare for the Oregon coast . He 'd stay till dawn . The view was better than his computer screen , or the ceiling over his bed . The phone buzzed against his thigh again . He resisted the urge to hurl the thing over the cliff , if only because he despised littering . It kept ringing . He counted the number of rings stored in his short-term memory . Twelve . Curiosity started to poke at him . Sixteen , seventeen . Wow , someone was desperate . Or just stubborn . Nineteen , twenty . Aw , what the hell . He clicked TALK . " Night Owl Lock and Safe . " " Oh , thank God . Finally . I thought I 'd misdialed . " A woman 's voice . Low , husky . Sexy Southern accent . He was intrigued , in spite of himself . " Nope , " he said . He offered no explanation . After a puzzled silence she pushed on . " I 'm locked out of my apartment . It 's 2465 Tremont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill . He was about to say he 'd be there in a few when a male voice said something loud but unintelligible . " Stop it , Edgar . " The sexy voice was muffled , no longer directed at the mouthpiece . " Keep your hands off-hey ! Back off ! I 'm not- " Thunk . The phone went dead . Zan stared at it , hit the caller redial . Let it ring , eight times . He felt jarred . Prodded by urgency . Like it was his responsibility to gallop of f and solve this girl 's problems with this dickhead Edgar . Not my problem . Repeat after me . Not . My . Fucking . Problem . The litany did n't do any good . Something was revving up inside him , part knee-jerk chivalry , part curiosity . If he did n't make sure the Southern belle was OK , he would worry all night . If he then found out that something bad had happened to some girl on Tremont , he would blame himself and feel like shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out if her face and body matched that soft , sexy voice . He laughed at himself as he headed for his van . Maybe this was all about his poor neglected libido . His self-imposed celibacy was biting his ass particularly hard lately . No point in analyzing it , though . A guy had to do what a guy had to do . Chapter Two Abby 's shove knocked Edgar almost of f his feet . He caught himself against the porch railing and glared at her . " So that 's the way you 're going to be . " " You forced me to be rude to you , Edgar . I tried to avoid it . " " Try harder , " Edgar said . " And give me back my goddamn pen . " His eyes had turned to glittering slits in his flushed face . Abby wedged herself into the corner of the porch and held out his pen . He jerked it out of her hand . Her phone , which had dropped to the floor in the scuffle , started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edgar kicked it out of reach . " Go ahead , " he jeered . " Bend over , sweet cheeks . It 's my favorite position . " Her insides went icy cold . The phone kept ringing , but she barely heard it , with his crude words and ugly tone ringing in her ears . Oh dear . She 'd taken Edgar for a harmless jerk . He 'd just mutated into something nastier . Her belly cramped . Elaine had said , what , twenty minutes before she called the cops ? A lot could happen in twenty minutes . One last shot at pseudo-politeness while she psyched herself up to scratch and gouge . " The locksmith is on his way , Edgar . There 's no reason to wait . Bye-bye . " He sensed her nervousness , and liked it . He oozed closer , until her back was pressed against the wall . " Scared , Abby ? " She forced herself to smile . " Nothing to be scared of , is there ? Look , we 're going to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cop , and he works weird hours , so he wo n't appreciate being bothered . " " You 're scared , " Edgar repeated , delighted by the discovery . " Of me . " He grabbed her wrists and pinned her to the wall . She struggled , panic squirming in her belly . His face was slick with sweat . Oh , gross . It became unpleasantly evident that he was excited . She tried to remember tricks from the self-defense course she 'd taken at the gym , but the only thing that came to mind were house keys . Good for eye jabbing , face raking and the like . Hah . Edgar licked her neck . Her stomach lurched . She dragged in a deep breath and drove her spike heel into his foot , with all her weight . Edgar howled . Whap , the back of her head smacked painfully into the shingled wall . " You bitch ! " " Let go of her , " said a deep voice . Edgar swiveled his head . " Who the fuck are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching herself against the wall . It was hard to follow what happened . It was dark , the stranger wore black , her eyes were watering , her head spun from the blow . Edgar whipped around like a rag doll and flailed , facedown on the floor . The stranger sank down on top of him , twisting Edgar 's hand behind his back , pinning his shoulder to the floor with his knee . She blinked tears from her eyes , squeezed them shut . Tried again . Yes , the man was still there , crouching on top of Edgar . He was real . Dark hair hung long and loose over a battered black leather jacket . Keen eyes studied her , thoughtful and curious . He grabbed Edgar 's hair , jerked his head up . " Apologize to her . " " Fuck you , " Edgar wheezed . " I 'll have you arrested , you scumbag piece of shit . I 'll ruin your goddamn life ! " The guy let go of Edgar 's hair and chopped the edge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shrieked . Blood bubbled . " Wrong answer , " the stranger said mildly . Edgar made wet choking sounds . The man shot her a questioning glance . " Want to call the cops ? I 'll verify that he was assaulting you . " She shook her head . " You want me to hit him some more ? " the man prompted . She forced sound past the lump in her throat . " If you could , ah , just make him go away , that would be great , thanks . " " OK . " He yanked up on Edgar 's hair . " This is your lucky day , pusbag . The nice lady does n't feel like watching you get stomped . Which is better luck than you deserve . You should thank her . " Edgar made gurgling noises . " Too bad , " the man murmured . " Another lost opportunity . " Edgar shrieked as the stranger jerked him to his feet , hand still twisted up behind him . He doubled over , moaning as the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white-knuckled . The men were soon lost to sight around the corner of the house . The stranger said something in a low , intense tone . Edgar coughed and gasped in reply . A car door slammed . Lights came on , a motor hummed to life . The Porsche revved up and crushed Mrs. Eisley 's pansy beds as it cut a corner out of the driveway and sped away . Silence . She wondered if the guy was just a wishful hallucination . The shadows in the bushes at the base of the stairs resolved into a tall , dark form . He climbed until Mrs. Eisley 's porch light shone full on his face , paused , and waited . She got the sense that he was trying not to scare her . Letting her get a good , long look at him . She could n't have stopped looking if she tried . The guy was straight out of a naughty dream , the kind she woke up from hot and damp and achingly lonesome . Tall and solid-looking , sharp cheekbones , an angular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His dark mane had the look of a long-ago haircut that he had n't bothered to refresh . There was a tattoo on his neck . He looked hard , seasoned . Dangerous . The kind of guy she 'd sworn off for all time . " Are you all right ? " he asked her , his voice hesitant . She clamped down on the hysterical laughter . " Yes , thank you . " His eyes flicked over her body . In the porch light , she could finally decipher the bright color . Not blue or gray . Topaz gold . She looked down to check what she was wearing . The Diego Della Valle . Low-cut , slinky , short . She 'd been regretting her outfit all night , the way Edgar had drooled over her cleavage all evening . This was different . The stranger 's brief , discreet once-over made her feel stark naked . She shivered , and let go of the railing to cross her arms across her breasts . She swayed , groping for the banister . He leaped up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . " Whoa ! Steady there . " " Sorry . " Her hands fluttered . She had no idea where to put them . He was all around her . The only place to rest them was his shoulders , tangled in his hair , wrapped around his waist . Gripping his butt . Whoa . He wore black cargo pants , covered with utilitarian pockets , all of which appeared to be in use . A gray T-shirt was stretched out across a broad , muscular chest . He smelled good , too . Like herbs . Rain on the earth , with faint accents of metal and woodsmoke and sea air . " Here . Sit . " He pulled her until she stumbled down two steps , and coaxed her into sitting down on the top step . " Put your head down . " She pressed her face against her knees as much to hide from those intense golden eyes as to recover from the head rush . " How about you let me run you over to the emergency room ? " he offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lovely . So she looked like death , too . " No , thanks , " she mumbled . " But he bashed your head against the wall . " He reached around and touched her head . The contact gave her a tingling shock . She leaned away . His hand dropped . " I 'm fine , thanks . " She sneaked a quick peek at his tattoos as she struggled to her feet . On his neck was the swirling knotwork of a black Celtic cross . The one on his hand was a pair of crossed cutlasses . Pirate swords . " OK , whatever , " he said . " Just go slow , OK ? " They stood there looking at each other until his brows knitted in a puzzled frown . " Why are you looking at me like that ? " " I , uh ... " She floundered . " I guess I was just sort of surprised to find you still here , after Edgar left . " His eyes narrowed . " Why would n't I be ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improbable . A mysterious guy pops up at the eleventh hour , like Batman . He does his thing , saves the day , and whoosh , he disappears . " A faint smile touched his lips . " But I have n't done my thing yet . " What was that supposed to mean ? Mrs. Eisley was deaf , and the night was dark , and she was shaking so hard , she could barely stand . He backed down two steps , hands lifted . " I do n't mean anything sinister . I just meant that I have n't done the job you called me for yet . " " Called you for ... for what ? " She was utterly lost . " The locksmith . Remember ? Your lockout ? " Her jaw dropped . " You 're the locksmith ? " " Yeah . " His sidelong glance was delicately cautious . " And , uh , exactly why is this so hard to believe ? " She looked over six feet and some odd inches of lethally gorgeous male . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expected someone with a potbelly and a bald spot . In a blue coverall . Named Irv . Or Mel .
