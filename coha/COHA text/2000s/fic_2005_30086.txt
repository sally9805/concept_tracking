Before the war , Glyditch had been a small , nondescript hamlet , a few rows of walk-ups and shops hugging the southern shore of the firth midway between Edinburgh and North Berwick . Unprepossessing as it had been , it had managed a lovely , serene stillness , a calming view of the water , and comfortable enough accommodations to meet the needs of some of Edinburgh 's posh crowd looking for a bit of quiet and rest-up for the weekend . But what had been nondescript yet quaint before the war had now taken on the qualities of disuse . Glyditch wore the same wartime drabness that much of Britain had taken on as its uniform in those days . And certainly , the chill winds off the North Sea and the whipping winter rains did little to dispel the air of Glyditch being a forgotten , dying place , and the notion that Glyditch was a place to pass through , not stay . Among the weather-beaten establishments overlooking the firth was a narrow five-story , the flats long abandoned by tenants who could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a small cadre of American officers and their support staff had installed a warren of cramped , paper-filled offices and tended to some of the more innocuous elements of the great war against the Hun . Lieutenant Colonel Harry Voss occupied one of those little cubbies . Sitting at his desk , poring over plat books and land leases , his reading spectacles parked far down the bulb of his nose , a cigarette dangling from thoughtfully pursed lips , huddled inside a heavy sweater and scarf of fine Scottish wool , he seemed less a military officer than a figure from " Bartleby the Scrivener . " There was a knock at his door which hedid not answer . The visitor was obviously experienced ; he did n't wait for a response and immediately entered . Harry glanced up from the plat books and over his reading spectacles just long enough to identify the intruder as one of the staff orderlies , a young private whose child-like form was lost in the folds of his Government Issue uniform . He was pushing a serving cart ahead of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collision with the desk by clanging into one of the overstuffed file cabinets . " Happy Thanksgiving , Colonel ! " the orderly chirped in some Great Plains drawl . " They all missed ya down in the mess ! Yore missin ' out on a helluva party ! " Harry resettled his spectacles on his nose . " I 'll muddle through . " The orderly awkwardly piloted past reefs of piled files until he docked the cart alongside Harry 's desk . He made a show of lifting each of the plate covers and declaring the scrumptiousness of the food with a loud sniff . " Mmmmm-mph ! The cooks did a right good job , Colonel ! Tried to make it just like home ! Even got cranberry sauce ! It 's that glop comes out a can , but it 's still cranberry sauce . Got some --  Well , I do n't rightly know what it is , some local sheep thing . A ' joint operation ' ' tween us ' n ' the Scots , ya might say ! Do n't look like much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get inta some o ' this while it 's hot , Colonel . " " Thanks . " Without looking up , Harry could sense the youngster 's disappointment , and his puzzlement that such a mouthwatering invitation could be so dispassionately rebuffed . " They did n't really have ' nuff turkey for ever'body , " the orderly confessed , attentively recovering the plates . " The junior officers got a lot of chickens mixed in . Turkey do n't seem to be so big over here . " The young man seemed to be looking for an excuse to maintain a conversation . He leaned over the studious Harry , peering out the office 's one narrow window . A gust of wind sent the pelting rain against the pane sounding like thrown gravel . " Funny how quiet it is ever'place else . I mean , it 's a helluva wing-ding they got goin ' downstairs ! ' N ' out there --  " " It 's just Thursday to them . " " I guess . " " A rainy Thursday . " " Yeah . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , maybe it 'll catch on . " Harry turned to study the orderly 's earnest , open face over the rims of his lenses . " Catch on ? " " You know , like they celebrate Christmas . Why not Thanksgiving ? " Harry sighed and returned to his paperwork . " They 've been celebrating Christmas a lot longer than we have . " The orderly was not so naifish as to miss Harry 's dismissive air : he began to back out of the office . " Well , enjoy yore dinner , Colonel . " Harry nodded a thanks and sighed pleasurably when he heard the door shut . But only a few minutes passed before he heard footsteps again creaking along the hardwood hallway floor toward his office . " You forget something , Private ? " Harry growled impatiently . No response . Harry sat up curiously . " Is somebody out there ? " Then , in an unreservedly artificial basso that echoed up and down the empty corridor : " Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth with whom Harry Voss was acquainted , only Joe Ryan would have refined the ability to balance himself on the doorknob , allowing his upper body to swing into the room while his feet remained in the doorway , and only Joe Ryan would have believed the hours spent in refining such a flourish were a worthwhile investment . " My God ! Joe ! " Harry tossed his glasses on the desk and shot to his feet , his face opening in a welcoming smile as he grasped the hand of Colonel Joseph P. Ryan , Judge Advocate 's Bureau . " Harry-boy ! " Ryan clasped Harry 's hand warmly in both his own . He stood back a moment , his bright green eyes squinting in study at the shorter , thicker officer in front of him . " That 's a rounder shadow than I thought Lamont Cranston would have . " " Drop dead . What are you doing here ? Are you AWOL ? " It was a dashing smile of perfect white teeth that Ryan flashed , a smile befitting the looks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , though they were of the same forty-odd years . " Colonels do not go AWOL . " Ryan emphasized the point with a leather-gloved finger . " Colonels conduct operations at their own discretion . " " Sit down , you dirty so-and-so ! " Ryan glanced about the cluttered cubby , glared at the one visitor 's chair bristling with files . " No mean feat , Harry-boy . " Like a contrite housekeeper , Harry hastily made room . " Who 'd you piss off to end up in this rat hole ? " Ryan pretended to dust the seat with his gloves before setting himself and his trimly tailored Royal Navy-styled bridge coat down . " I like this rat hole , " Harry retorted , returning to his own chair . " I think it 's cozy . " " You think anything that reminds you of home is cozy . " Ryan leaned toward the serving cart , peeked under a cover . " Need I remind you that you lived in a tenement ? Oof ! " Then , in a horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our loverly Army cooks be havin ' a try at proper holiday victuals ? " " I hate when you do that . " As Ryan opened his coat , Harry noted the steam-pipe fit of the colonel 's Eisenhower jacket . " Did you lose weight ? " " Living in the field makes you hard , Harry . " " I thought you wrote me you were living in a hotel in Liege . " " That 's close enough to the field for me . C'm on , let 's go . " " Go where ? " " You 've got to show me some sights . " " What sights ? Have you seen this town ? There are no sights . " The room was close enough that Ryan could lean back , snag Harry 's coatrack with a finger , and pull it near enough to where he could bob Harry 's cap free of its hook . " Let me put it to you another way . " He tossed Harry 's cap onto the desk . " Let 's get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cap and reached for his jacket . " I do n't know what you think you 're going to see . It 's raining . And there 's a blackout . Did I mention the rain ? " " You can be such a killjoy , Harry-boy -- a **36;653;TOOLONG killjoy ! " In the doorway , Harry frowned and nodded toward the serving cart . " What about that ? " Joe Ryan smiled and made an inviting gesture of his arm . " Little mice , little mice , wherever you are . . . bon appetit . " There had been a small establishment -- a cafe of sorts -- overlooking the beach where the tourists -- in those days when there had been tourists -- could purchase some refreshment and lounge about on the roofed patio , watching the waters of the firth roll into shore . Like the rest of Glyditch , it had not been much to look at , but along with lemonade and assorted snacks , there had been a modest stock of champagne and brandies , Swiss chocolates , tins of caviar , and other unexpected delicacies . But years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had left the place derelict , decaying , picked over by scavengers . It had been but a walk of a few minutes from Harry 's office to the seaside cafe , but even in that short time , wrestling their umbrellas against the muscular wind , they found their trouser legs sopping by the time they reached the shelter of the patio . They folded their brollies and left them on the barren serving counter , shook the drops from their shoes and cuffs , huddled together against the wind to nurse a flaming match against a pair of cigarettes . Ryan took a deep draft of his cigarette , then squinted against the wind , looking out toward the firth , watching the wind stir the wave tops to a white froth under the last feeble light of the day . He turned , looked at the dreary facades of the buildings along the waterfront . " What the hell 're you doing here , Harry ? " " We compile information on land availability , negotiate access and use for estate lands by the military --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should 've said something to me when they assigned you . I might 've been able to get you out of it . " " I did n't want to get out of it . " " Is everything OK at home ? " Ryan asked , sincerely concerned . " I hope so . " Harry shrugged off Ryan 's worry . " It 's quiet . I like that . " " All those years of law school and now you 're a goddamn real estate broker . Hardly seems lawyerly to me . " " I like it . " " Nobody bothers you . " " Nobody bothers me . " " Oh , so little Harry 's learned his lesson . " " He 's learned his lesson . " " Keep your head down , your mouth shut , blend in with the walls . " " That 's the ticket . " " You are so full of shit . . . " " Flattery was never your strong suit . " " Not true . You better than anybody else know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advocate 's . But one kisses ass up the chain of command , not down . " " Pile it on . I still have a shred of dignity left . " " Harry . . . " Ryan paced a restless little circle . The wind picked up a few knots and the rotting timbers of the cafe moaned under the abuse . " If you want to keep abusing me , could you do it someplace that 's warm and dry ? " " No . Harry , what would it take to get you to fight one more fight you could n't win ? " " What kind of fight ? " " Dominick Sisto needs your help . " " Dominick ? He get caught breaking into another wine cellar ? That cost him his sergeant 's stripes , you know , back when his outfit --  " " Was still in Italy , I know . This is . . . bigger than that . And , by the way , he 's a lieutenant now . " " Dominick ? A lieutenant ? I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch when they transferred his division to England for a re-fit . I kept meaning to get down there . I have n't heard from him in a while . I assumed they were sent into France . " " Belgium , " Ryan said glumly . " A placed called the Huertgen Forest on the border with Germany . Not that far from where I am in Liege . That 's how I know about this . My office is handling the case . " Still not expecting anything more serious than a charge of drunk and disorderly , Harry asked , " How much trouble is he in ? " Ryan took a last puff and stamped his cigarette out with finality . He looked out toward the firth with a sigh . " Worst case ? **49;691;TOOLONG kind of trouble . " For a moment , Harry thought -- hoped -- this was a poor jest of Ryan 's . But the other man turned to look at Harry with a sad , helpless confirming nod . " Dominick ? " Harry shook his head , denying , disbelieving . " Desertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct order -- and do n't say Dominick again . Yes , Dominick . Making a mutiny . They 're throwing a load of other Mickey Mouse stuff on his head as icing . " " I know the drill . " Harry leaned against the counter . Again , they were quiet . Again , the strange moan of the wind through the rafters of the cafe . " You said this is up in your neighborhood . You could n't do anything ? " " Ca n't . I 'm going to be sitting on the trial as law officer . He asked for you , Harry . " Harry shook his head . " Defense Counsel should n't come from the Judge Advocate 's staff . " " That 's the recommendation , but it 's not ironclad . You 're not a part of my Judge Advocate 's staff . Right now you 're not part of anybody 's Judge Advocate staff . Hell , Harry , you have n't even done any trial work since you transferred here . " " If the Defense Counsel comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfairness . Even if I 'm not attached at the moment --  " Ryan laughed caustically . " Harry , we 're way past the appearance of impropriety ! I 'm so far out on a limb . . . I 'm not even here officially ! I have to be on a plane back to Liege in a couple of hours so I 'm back for reveille . If it gets out that Dominick 's judge snuck over here to draft Dominick 's Defense Counsel . . . All three of us wind up in the crapper . " " Does anybody there know how well you know the kid ? " " They know I know him , but they do n't know I know him . If they did , I 'd be pressured to recuse myself . " " Who 's prosecuting ? Anybody I know from the London days ? " " Trial counsel 's a new guy , captain named Courie , came on with me in September , just before we shipped out from London . Word was he was some kind of hotshot ADA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those young up-and-coming types . I do n't know what that means in Cleveland ! For all I know , a major crime there is kicking someone 's dog . I think he 's thinking of something better when he gets home than being an ADA in Cleveland . " " He 's trying to run up a score over here ? " Ryan nodded . " Since I 've known him . He 's hungry , Harry , and he 's a smoothie . Except in the courtroom . Then the gloves come off and there he 's a tiger . A maneater ! You come out of the courtroom after a tussle with Courie , you 'd better count your fingers to make sure you still have ' em all . " He pushed himself into this , that 's how hungry he is . With his pedigree , it would 've looked funny if I 'd tried to block him . Let me warn you : Courie 's sharp , he 'll smell something if I do n't play this perfectly straight , so do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're at trial . "
