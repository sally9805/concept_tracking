When National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice announced that the President would be making a series of speeches this week , it looked like the stagecraft that signals a big U-turn . Advisers had been whispering about making a " recalibration , " in which the President would tighten up the message about progress in the war overseas and safety at home . Was this it ? Yes , but by using big-shot Rice , the White House sent too strong a signal  --  sometimes even the recalibration needs recalibration . The more nuanced shift of this week , according to an adviser , is " setting things right and putting them in perspective . " With anthrax mysteries multiplying at home and no stunning successes overseas , White House advisers believe the string of scientists , Cabinet officers and agency heads answering each flare-up has created a diffuse picture . Bush needs to remind Americans and allies about the terror that launched the campaign , what has been achieved , and the patience that will be needed . The back-to-basics plan is reminiscent of Bush 's strategy during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his core issues of education and compassion . So this week , to leaven images of advisers clustered around mikes in D.C. briefing rooms talking about spores , Americans can expect to see Bush address the homeland threat from the heartland . He hopes to chart the progress that has been made so far , devoting one address to the success his team has had in drying up terrorist money sources . Bush is also looking forward to playing action President on the world stage by serving as host to French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair , and meeting with President General Musharraf of delicate ally Pakistan . The Administration hopes each event will demonstrate the sturdiness of the global antiterror alliance . Bush will make the case for U.S. action explicitly at the U.N . this weekend in a previously scheduled address that was postponed by the bombing . The reason for the delay alone should bring the perspective the White House is aiming for . <P>  --  By John F. Dickerson                @ @ @ @ @
