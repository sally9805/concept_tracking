' Derelict , ' Naughton 's kid had said to Rascob on the evening of the third Tuesday in March at the Getty station , collecting $31.50 for an oil change and two new filters he said the old grey Lincoln Town Car badly needed . ' Air and oil both , ' he said . ' Took a chance and did it . Old ones 're both shot . Air filter looked like a gorilla wiped his arse with it . Oil filterrollah toilet paper , brand new . Saved ' em , case you wan na see themshow you both of them , you like . ' ' Take your word , ' Rascob said . ' Damn thing 's got ta run . ' ' Did n't think you 'd mind , ' Naughton 's kid said . He 'd finished in the top fifteen percent on the police exam and was waiting out the next list of appointments to the academy . ' Oh-kay , ' Rascob said . ' Gon na hafta get a new one . But the Uncle likes it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio works , ' the Naughton kid said , laughing . ' ' Do n't care ah fuckin ' thing looks likeruns anna radio works . ' ' Right , ' Rascob said .

Brake lightsbulb above the license plate . And whatever you do , do n't go over the speed limit . Nothin'give ' em nothin'that way you should be all right . ' Rascob tried his best to be on time for his weekly meetings with Dominic Frolio . Dominic was his last appointment of the morning , but meeting him took patienceand at least twenty-five minutes . Dominic joined him no less than eight minutes after he arrived and he would not hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKeach said . It still made Rascob nervous ; one January morning the trunk of the Town Car had held more than $817,000 in cash . The New England Pats had had a bad Sunday , losing the AFC Championship to the Denver Broncos ; the Boston books 'd done well . When Rascob had started meeting Dominic , in the early eighties , the house on the corner of Apthorp Street had been a neat and modest white five-room bungalow with green trim , a screened sun porch added on the front . Genevieve had been making noises about moving to a larger place , a better neighborhood . Dominic said he would n't . He and Genevieve had lived there since he went to work as a spot welder at the shipyard . ' Endah World War Twoforty years ago . Yard 's really busy then . Anyone who wanted , was n't dead , could make a buck . Everybody building boats . Naturallymost the merchant fleet got sunk . ' Then the shipyard went under . His job went away . ' Anyway , my back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onna stagin ' . ' But he had the Beachside , at the traffic lights . ' So it was okay . Made it good . Took up my time , you know ? Kept me occupied . ' In the Beachside he ran the action that Brian G. had watched over years before for a fee and McKeach now kept provisioned and protected , as he protected the old grey Town Car full of currency on its way into Boston and the back room at Flynn 's Spa , Beer &; Wine , Superette , at Old Colony and B. ' Once they knew who you were with : that was all they hadda know . No one bothered you . Safe 's you 'd ah been in your dear mother 's arms . ' Things stayed the same after Brian G. went down and McKeach took over . So Frolio could say now , as he did : ' Nothing bad 's ever happened , me and Jenny , we bought that fuckin ' house . It 's a lucky house , I think . Did n't know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . ' Jenny did not share his contented trust . After every hurricane season and severe winter she had to replace the azaleas killed by the salt water , muttering forebodings that some day the roaring storms would wash them and the house away . He did not listen . He never left the protection of it until he had made as sure as possible that it was safe to go outside . ' Always try to take a piss , ' fore I go out . That way I do n't hafta look around , find a place to take a leak , ten minutes after I been out . An ' naturally I never leave itany morning , whatsoever'til I 've had a good shit for myself . ' Then he put on his cap and jacket , regardless of the season . On very hot days in August he did n't zip the jacket . On very humid mornings , he sometimes wore the Bermuda shorts he put on before he went to sit outside on his green-and-yellow aluminum folding lawn chair in the early afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't believe that cancer stuff , sun is bad for you . Father always liked the sunhe died , he 's ninety-two . What happened , all a sudden ? Now it 's bad for us ? Everybody 's trynah scare us . I figure it ca n't hurt . ' Leaving the house on the mornings Rascob came , Dominic would pick up the same small , dark-blue canvas gym bag with black plastic handles Rascob had noticed the first day McKeach had introduced them . One day , several years later , Rascob mentioned to Dominic that the bag had lasted well , and Dominic had said , ' All my things do . They should . I 'm not hard on stuff . ' The last minute-plus was for walking out to meet Rascob . Fourteen years had passed since Nino Giunta went to what was then MCI Walpole with twenty-to-life in front of him , and Rascob succeeded him as Dominic 's contact . Thirteen and a half had passed since the first and last time Rascob had suggested that Dominic forget the eight-minute delay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Nino . Most guys I 've done business with , I have got along with good . Four of them so far , you 've lasted the longestand that 's not even counting you . The three before Nino , and then him . And then you . ' When something 's happened to themthey got careless , trusted someone they shouldn't 've ; did something they 're not sure of ? Then they hadda go away ? Or they just disappeared , during all the trouble here ? I been , you know , sorry for them . Hoped whatever happened to them , not . . . too bad . They did n't have much pain . Nothing I could do'cept wish they 'd been more careful . But still , I did feel sorry . Bad they hadda go away . ' Nino I did not . Very careless man . Loud about it , too . ' Look at me , everyone , oh ho , I 'm the big cheese inna thing . Everybody kiss my ass . I 'm a great big city man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in WalpoleI 'm right ? Will be a long time . Do n't wan na be there with him . Always figured him for trouble . Never liked the guy . ' In the rearview mirror this March day Rascob saw the grey aluminum storm door open at the front of the first-floor front room with the picture windows that had been the screened-in porch before Jenny 's compromise conversion . Dominic emerged and shut the door securely with both hands , the right one on the knob and the left , holding the gym bag , pushing on the wood above it . Those who live in the wind respect it . Dominic disappeared from the mirror when he reached the right rear quarter panel of the Lincoln . Rascob sighed and slouched , reaching forward with his right hand to shut off the ignition and remove his keys from the lock , then unlatching his seatbelt . Dominic appeared at the right front window , bending only slightly to peer in , raising his bushy grey-black eyebrows under the visor of his black leather cap , rapping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped the seatbelt over his shoulder , in the same movement opening his door and getting out . By the time he had the door closed , Dominic had sidled around to the driver 's side through the narrow space Rascob had left between the seawall and the front bumper , shifting the bag to his right hand and steadying himself with his left on the warm hood . He left three hand prints that would remain visible in the obliquely angled afternoon light of late winter until the next downpour . Rascob went to the back of the car and used the key to open the trunk . Inside there was a black ballistic nylon duffel bag . Rascob reached in with both hands and unzipped it . It contained several brown paper bags with hand-written figures in green or black Magic Marker . Dominic put the gym bag into the trunk and unzipped it . He removed four brown paper bags with numerals hand written on them in blue Magic Marker and put them in the suitcase . He stepped back with the gym bag and Rascob closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he kept in his head , for the amusement of learning later from his actual count how accurate his quick mental tallies had been , Rascob stepped back and slammed the trunk shut . He returned to the driver 's door , ready to use the ignition key . ' You want to leave the bag ? ' he said . ' I think so , Max , ' Frolio said . ' Cold today . Forgot my gloves again . ' He opened the left rear door and put the bag inside on the seat . He closed the door and put his hands into his pockets . Rascob locked the car . ' Nice tah see you . Should take a little walk . Clears the lungs out . Andthings to talk about . ' ' Dom , ' Rascob said , nodding once , ' by all means . Always look forward to it . ' They went north along the seawall until they came to a flight of four cement steps with green iron railings leading up to the platform at the top . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beach . Dominic went first , clenching the railings with his liver-spotted hands , assisting his leg muscles with his forearms . Rascob had once asked McKeach how old Frolio was . McKeach shrugged . ' Du n no , ' he said . ' Brian G. 's his original rabbiunless it was Moses . He 's where he is when Brian got whacked , same place he is today . Doin ' the exact same thing , same way he does today . Knows from nothin ' , anything that 's going on . Ask him something and he 'll tell you , he just owns ah liquor store . All that 's on his mind . Already 'd been doing it for years back when I first run up against him . How many ? Du n no . How old he 's then ? When he got started ? Who brought him in ? Du n no that either . Did n't ask him . See , by then I 'm over thirty and I knew a couple things . Things you did n't fuck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief . And so that was what you did . He was one of them , so you dealt with him . ' Not the only one . Lot of guys to deal with . Same kind of position . Never really heard about themhow they wanted it . Never looking to move up in anything , never lookin ' to branch out . And also never took a bust . Not really that involved in thingswhat 's goin ' on in town , pickin ' sides or anything . Just trynah stay in business , you know ? ' For them the war was an inconvenience . Same as ' The power 's out . Fuckin ' Edison fucked up , house 's dark , and now fuck , it 's gettin ' coldno way to make coffee . ' People dyin ' ? Brian G. goin ' down , Rocco , all kinds of guysto guys like Dominic it was all an inconvenience . Did n't care who controlled things . ' ' Just gettah damn thing fixed , all right ? ' All they cared about back then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it comes out , far as they 're concernedwork with anybody . Will , too . Sit tight ' til it 's over withthat was all was on their minds . ' So I decide I ought a have a talk with Nick . Go and see the Frogman , all right ? We always been all right . Find out which way he 's leaning ; what he thought that we could do . ' First I call . Those days , hadda be careful . Someone does n't know you 're comin ' and then he looks up and sees you ? Might get the wrong idea . Could get dangerous , things got straightened out . So , I go and sit down with him . Back room down the Lamplight . And we talk , you know ? Saw things the same way I did . This was something we could do , try to get things straightened out . Middle sixties , this was . ' An ' that 's all it was , all right ? Not like you may 've heard some guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't what we had in mindall came afterwards . No , it was justwe would see what we could do . Sort of date it all from then . ' By then Dominic 's got ta be pushin ' eighty . Hasta be eighty , now . Bastard does n't look it . Tougher'n a pail of nails . Hate to be the guy who stiffs him . Dom takes care himself . ' Brown kelp and bleached-out cardboard packaging washed ashore by the severest winter storms lay against the base of the seawall . Ragged lines of weeds and rubbish marked off the beach at intervals of about a yard leading down to the clean dark sand exposed beyond the high-water mark . A faded white sign with red lettering still attached to the broken end of one white post warned that diving and shellfishing were hazardous and therefore prohibited . Idly , as he had each week since he had first seen the sign , Rascob wondered who would have wanted to wade in water too polluted for safe swimming . ' Things 're too good , ' Dominic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps . Ahead of them a woman in a blue hooded sweatshirt and sweatpants with white piping sat red-faced and breathing heavily on an overturned brown milk crate , staring out on the bay . To the north beyond her the Boston skyline rose indistinctly silver in a light haze , the sunlight approaching midday flat on the glass towers . At intervals of about two minutes big jets disturbed the air around them , then roared past , descending on their right . ' President 's got problems , ' Frolio said . ' Nobody gives a shit . Everybody 's all got work , much work 's least they need . Bringing paychecks home . That 's what they care aboutshould , too . Things 're good for them , their families . That 's why it does n't matter , what he does , this one or the other one . Wife catches him again ? Still stands up for him . She knowsall knowlong 's she does this for him , he 's her fuckin ' employee . Must do what she says . President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not say anything . Frolio said : ' No women , ever , on the job . That 's where he went wrong . Can not mix pussy and work . Women stay home , take care of babies . ' All this equality and shit , we hear all the time ? Absolutely for it . Known a lot more smart women'n smart men . And I 've known a lot more menyou know what that means . Only two women I have known who made big trouble for themselves by not thinking before they did something with sex , and that is all . Many men ? Ca n't count ' em . So that is why it is my ruleno women onna job I run . ' There 's a woman inna building , matter how ugly she is , some man will lose his head . His woman 'll find out . Then you will have trouble . ' ' I see , ' Rascob said , not seeing at all . ' Ford , ' Dominic said . ' Charlie Ford . ' ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect , I should think . He needs financing ? ' ' Not him , no , ' Frolio said , ' unfortunately . For him I would say Yes , at once . A good man , old Charlie Ford . This his son , young Charlie Ford . He came to me . I did n't go to him . He was the only one . ' ' Well , even so , ' Rascob said , ' he should be enough to do it , if what he 's got is big enough . . . . Which would n't be unusual , in that kind of thing . And even if he could n't use the whole of it , you know , two-forty or three hundred , well , we could live with that . The other sixty , someplace elseit would n't be that hard . ' ' He asked me for a million six , ' Frolio said . ' He asked me , could we do that . ' Rascob whistled . ' Quite a lot , ' he said , ' but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable ? ' ' Has been before , ' Frolio said . ' Not that he has that much himself that he can get it from , but if a deal went bad for him , he could make it good . The thing is that the first time it was a little thing , a small matter of forty large for a little union problem . And the other time we did some business with him , the much larger matter . He was doing something else . That time for the fishing boat , taking guns someplaceIreland , I believe . ' Gut said No . Too many people ; sentiment involved . Bad combination , sentiment and money . Coast Guard . . . we were lucky . Buyers paidadvance . Two anna quarter . Young Charlie 's father would 've covered him , the nature of that deal , if the money had n't been there . ' This time , the father would n't . Not a business of this kind . Cocaine . Father would turn away . ' ' Would the father have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the tallest buildings on the skyline , heading for the airport . ' He would , ' Frolio said . ' The risk is big . His plan is not to use the planes again . ' He made a small gesture with his right thumb toward the sky above the water . ' Too risky . To have the transporters swallow the condoms the day of the night that they come here from Puerto Rico , Mexico , whatever . ' I say to him that I agree . ' Wo n't work . Ever since the time the rubbers burst inside the people , they got sick . At least one died . Now they watch the airplanes , getting on and off . Profilingkind of people who they know would do such a thing for pay . You try a thing like that again and you lose all the moneydrugs and people too . ' Besides , we do not do that . Family rulewe do not conduct such business . ' ' ' Well , ' Rascob said , drawing the word out . Dominic looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Charlie says to me . ' The son is dead . The boss in jail . ' ' ' Viva la Famiglia , ' I say to him . ' And the Family 's not in jail . The rule is of the Family , not the boss , who is in jail , or the son and father , dead . ' ' Rascob gazed straight ahead and said nothing . The wind gnawed at the back of his neck and he reached back with both hands , awkwardly , to pull his hat down on his head and tug up the collar of his trenchcoat . ' You do n't agree , ' Frolio said . Rascob said , ' Oh , I agree . The Family rule is as you sayof course we honor it . But as you know there 's been an exception made in recent years . Many times , in fact . For money to be made . The business has become so greatif we do n't participate we will lose control . Soconducting it is not allowed , but financing is permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged . ' ' I have not , ' Dominic said . ' If you go to McKeach and report what I have said , and he tells you I am wrong and the money should be given , then you tell him I said that someone else must take itput it on the street for this forbidden business . This oneif he decides to do this one , he does it himself . That is all I have to say . '
