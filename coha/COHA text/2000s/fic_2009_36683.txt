August <p> Ray sat in a van on Jefferson Avenue in Bristol in the rain , watching people come and go from the white corner house with blue shutters and a cast- iron bird feeder in the yard . A kid in his late teens sat on the stoop eating candy from a bag and talking to the people moving in and out . Sometimes they handed the kid something ; sometimes he just waved them up the steps to the door . Nobody stayed more than a few minutes . Ray 's partner , Manny , climbed from the passenger seat into the back and pulled binoculars out of a gym bag . He sat on the rear seat away from view and watched the kid and the front door , then moved the glasses along the street . Looking for open windows , young lookout kids watching the traffic , anyone that might signal the long- limbed teenaged boy on the stoop that there was trouble coming . <p> Ray took the glasses back for one last look . The people coming up the steps were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only thing they had in common was that nearly all of them looked like shit . Hair uncombed . Lined faces the color of ashes . It reminded him of that movie where the dead are walking , coming to beat their way into this little farmhouse in the country . Only <p> instead of breaking down the doors , the zombies stood quiet on the porch until there was an exchange through the door , and then the zombies went away . <p> Ray combed his mustache with his fingers and shrugged . " What do you think ? " <p> He handed the glasses back to Manny , who stashed them under the seat and brought out a blue windbreaker with DEA spelled out on the back in bright yellow letters . He pulled it on while Ray slid over to the passenger seat and opened the glove compartment , taking out a black semiautomatic pistol , a big , ugly Glock with an extra- capacity magazine . Manny heaved himself into the driver 's seat and Ray climbed around him and put his own windbreaker on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the van . <p> " Wait for a break in the traffic . " They watched two young girls on the stoop , one of them doing that little nervous dance of waiting for dope , like bees Ray had seen in a documentary , vibrating with some kind of insect ecstasy of anticipation . When they were away down the street , Ray touched Manny 's arm . <p> Manny put the van into gear and drove down the block , stopping at the corner and making a right onto the side street next to the house with the blue shutters . Manny reached into an oversized gym bag and handed Ray a pair of fifteen- inch bolt cutters and then took out a short- barreled Remington shotgun . He pulled his badge out of his clothes and let it dangle at the end of a chain over his shirt . <p> It was August , and it had rained every day for a week . Ray thought the bad weather was making everyone edgy , tense . Stuck indoors when they wanted to be out . Maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street from the side window , fingering the badge on his chest , then jumped out and ducked behind the house and pressed himself against the wall next to the basement door . He put the bolt cutters on the chain holding the padlock on the door and looked at his watch and counted in his head . <p> Manny ran up the street to the front of the house and swung over the fence without a sound . He put his shotgun against the side of Candy Kid 's face and spoke quietly . " What 's your name ? " <p> The kid stopped eating and clamped his mouth shut . " Jerome . " <p> " What you eating , Jerome ? " <p> " Jolly Ranchers . " The bag began to shake slightly in the kid 's hands . <p> Manny looked at his watch without taking his hands off the gun . " Is there enough for everyone ? " Jerome swallowed and tried to see the barrel of the gun out of the corner of his eye . " Let 's go inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and turned awkwardly around , the gun glued to the side of his face . He was tall standing up , taller than Manny , who was more than six feet , and he bent slightly at the waist . They walked slowly to the front door ; Manny stayed off to the left and moved the gun down to Jerome 's side , keeping out of view of the peephole cut in the door . He looked at his watch and whispered to Jerome . " Okay , let 's not make any mistakes . Knock twice and wait . Tell them you got ta use the can . " <p> Jerome lifted his arm and banged the door twice . <p> AT THE BACK door Ray lowered his watch and cut the chain . He hit the door hard with his body and it gave slightly , so he backed off and put his shoulder into it and the door popped open , banging against the wall . He was in a basement , the only light coming down the stairs from the first floor , where Manny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down , down , down , federal agents ! " <p> Ray hit the stairs in time for a teenaged girl with her shirt tied at her waist to appear at the top step , moving fast . Ray lifted the big , squared- off Glock with both hands and pointed it at her head . " Federal agents ! Back up the stairs , now ! Hands on your head ! " <p> She shrieked and fell back into the kitchen , knocking over a bulked- up kid with a diamond earring who was right behind her with his arms full of small plastic bags . The kid was wearing an oversized black Sixers jersey with iverson on the back . Ray reached down with one hand and pulled them apart and pushed them out of the kitchen toward the front of the house . He heard Manny telling someone named Jerome to lie flat . They came out to the living room , where Manny had two tall kids stretched out on the floor , the sprawl of their long legs eating up all the space . <p> Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor near the front door next to an ancient double- barreled shotgun with the stock cut down . " You two , on the floor right now . " <p> The boy and girl lay flat , between a bright green couch and a glass- topped coffee table supported on the backs of metallic gold elephants . The living room was neat , with photos of a smiling kid in a cap and gown from Ray guessed thirty years ago on the wall near the stairs . There were doilies under the knickknacks on the end tables . <p> Manny pointed to one of the kids near the front door . The kid was impossibly long stretched out on the floor , wearing faded jeans and a hoodie with a stenciled picture of a fist clutching a pistol . " This is Jerome . " <p> Ray stood over him . " Jerome , who else is in the house ? " <p> " No one . " <p> " Do n't lie to me , Jerome . " <p> " I ai n't lying . " <p> " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to be pissed off , you understand me ? " Ray opened his jacket and pulled a half- dozen sets of plastic flex cuffs out and began restraining the kids on the floor . <p> Manny moved the pump gun in a slow arc , covering each one in turn . " I 'm gon na go look now , okay ? What am I gon na find ? " <p> The girl murmured something under her breath . <p> " What was that ? What did she say ? " <p> " She said maybe Ronald upstairs . " <p> " Ronald , now ? How come she 's helping the police and you 're not helping the police , Jerome ? I 'm about done with you , son . <p> Who else is in this house ? " " Maybe Ronald . " " Maybe Ronald . " Ray sighed theatrically . " Jerome , when you are standing tall before the judge I am going to be your only friend , do you understand that ? What am I going to tell the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them go looking for <p> Maybe Ronald , or that you helped resolve this situation ? " <p> " I do n't know . " The kid 's voice was muffled by the carpet . <p> " What ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " You can be a hero , Jerome . You can be the one makes sure no <p> one gets hurt , that the police get the money and the drugs off the street . Believe me , Jerome , you want me to tell the judge you were a hero and not an uncooperative dirtbag . You know the difference ? " <p> There was a long silence . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> The kid with the Iverson shirt said , " Heroes get a beatdown . " <p> Ray looked at him . " Shut up . Heroes get to finish high school , and dirtbags go to jail . " He finished cuffing the kids on the floor and straightened up . <p> Manny took a hand off the gun and yanked Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him to come down here with nothing in his hands . " He walked Jerome to the foot of the stairs . <p> Jerome leaned against the wall , unbalanced with his hands cuffed behind him . He called up the stairs . " Ronald ! " <p> Ray waggled his eyebrows at Manny , who put a cupped hand to the side of his mouth . <p> " Ronald ! Come on down here with your hands up . " Manny kept Jerome between himself and the stairs , lowering his body to use the tall kid as a shield . " Ronald ! " <p> " What ? " The voice was high- pitched , quavering . <p> Manny slapped the wall . " Do n't ' what ' me , you pain in the ass . You get down here on the ground right now . You want to get shot ? " <p> " No , I do n't . " <p> " Then come on down . " There was another silence . Ray trained his pistol on the stairs and waited . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Manny said , " We 're the police , Ronald . The police do n't just shoot people . " <p> The kid with the Iverson shirt said , " Bullshit , they do n't . " <p> After a long minute , brilliant white Jordans appeared at the top of the stairs ; then Ronald slowly walked down , looking all of about twelve in an oversized red jeans jacket and gold chains . When he reached the bottom step , Manny stepped from behind Jerome and laid Ronald down next to his friends , and Ray took another pair of flex cuffs out of his jacket . <p> Iverson said , " Punk , " under his breath . <p> Ray flicked the back of his head with the plastic cuffs . " Shut your mouth . " He ratcheted the cuffs around the smaller kid 's skinny arms . " Maybe Ronald is my hero . " <p> Manny stayed in the living room , his long , thin frame bent over the shotgun like a pool hall sharper draped over a cue . Ray went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found a roll of big plastic trash bags , jammed his pistol into his belt , and pulled a bag off the end of the roll . He dropped to his knees and began scooping the dropped Baggies off the floor into the green trash bag . He held up one and inspected it  --  tiny vials , each one with a few rocks of blue- white crystal  --  and then shoved it into the trash bag . He opened the freezer , the oven , the dishwasher . In a drawer near the back door he found a pistol , an Italian .32 with rust on the handle , and he pocketed it and went out to the front room . <p> Manny was going through their pockets , turning out rolls of bills and tossing them over by the stairs . Ray grabbed them up and shoved them in the bag . He went to the front door and retrieved the metal cash box , open and showing stacks of fives and tens . Ray upended it , spilling the money in with the vials . He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shells into a corner , and tucking the gun awkwardly under one arm . <p> His eyes kept going to the picture on the wall . A light- skinned black woman in a yellow cap and gown , cheeks wide with her smile . Even white teeth and almond- shaped eyes with a kind of fierce intelligence that made Ray feel uneasy . Guilty . For standing in her house , maybe , for waving a gun . Probably at one of her children or grandchildren . <p> Ray leaned over the kids . " Jerome , where 's the rest of the money and the stash ? " The big kid was silent . The kid with the Iverson jersey shifted , glaring at Jerome . Ray snapped his fingers . " Do n't look at Iverson , look at me . Where 's the rest ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " You do know . Do n't look at him . Is he going to do your time ? Is he going to take care of your mom while you do ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge for you and get you home to night in time to watch The Gilmore Girls ? " <p> " No . " <p> " No is right . " Manny pulled Jerome to his feet by his cuffed hands and propelled him into the kitchen . Ray followed , keeping the pistol where the others could see it . Ray stood in the doorway and saw Manny put his head close to Jerome 's and whisper . Jerome looked over his shoulder toward the room where his friends were laid out , then whispered something back . Manny grinned , then stood back and banged his hand on the kitchen table hard . " Goddammit , tell me something . " He smiled wider and Jerome shyly smiled back at Manny 's game . <p> Manny ducked into a bathroom off the kitchen while Ray made a show of marching Jerome over to his friends and laying him down on the floor . " Looks like Jerome do n't want to help the police . I guess he 's going away upstate for a while . See his uncles out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag from the floor and threw it over his shoulder like a pistol- toting Santa . " Nobody move , now . " <p> He backed into the kitchen . Manny was holding up two wet plastic bags , one filled with vials , the other with cash . Ray pulled the bag from his shoulder and handed it to Manny , who moved silently down the stairs . Ray stuck his head into the doorway to the front room and looked over the prone bodies . He heard the girl ask Jerome how Ray knew his uncle was at Camp Hill and Jerome telling her to please shut the fuck up . <p> " Keep your heads down and be still . Since Jerome is n't telling us what we need to know , we 're searching the rest of the house . I 'm leaving Maybe Ronald in charge . " He ducked back into the kitchen and followed Manny down the stairs , through the basement and out to the street . Manny was starting the engine on the van , the side door open . Ray threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slammed the door . <p> They drove in silence for a minute , Manny keeping it at the speed limit and making quick turns , Ray spinning in his seat to look behind them . After a couple of blocks , Ray opened a gym bag and dropped the pistol in ; he reached over and took the badge from around Manny 's neck . He leaned forward awkwardly in the seat and took off his windbreaker and stuffed it into the bag with the guns and badges and a couple of leftover pairs of flex cuffs . They turned out onto Route 13 , and he reached over and grabbed the wheel and held it straight while Manny took off his jacket . <p> Ray thought about the kids lying in the front room , whispering to each other . He wondered how long it would take them to begin to move around , get up , tiptoe into the kitchen , their heads cocked for the slightest sound . He imagined Jerome peering down the cellar steps , his hands still cuffed , and realizing they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag for a minute , then held his hand out to Manny . <p> " Jolly Rancher ? " <p> ray watched the cars around them as they drove west on the Pennsylvania Turnpike . " That was a nice house . Whose house do you think that was ? " <p> " Someone 's grandma , I 'd bet . " Manny clicked the radio on , low . " Maybe Ronald 's . " <p> " Did n't stink , it was all kept up . It was like Crack House Lite . " Ray picked up the trash bag and set it on his lap , running his fingers through the loose cash and vials . He stuck a finger through the plastic bag of cash from the toilet tank and made a hole , thumbing the bills , looking at denominations . <p> Manny looked over . " How did we do ? " <p> " We ? Who did all the work ? " <p> " Get the fuck out of here . Who got Jerome to spill ? " <p> Ray waved his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid on the toilet . Doper kids like that only know two places to hide shit , and I already looked in the fridge . " <p> " I have to admit I got a kick out of that ' help the police ' stuff . How many times the cops tried to play me and my friends like that . " <p> Ray shrugged . " They call it the command voice . It 's a gift some people have . Your problem is you do n't watch enough TV . One or two episodes of Cops 'll tell you anything you want to know about managing the criminal element . " <p> " Please , the criminal element . They were all like fifteen . An episode of Sesame Street could have told you anything you needed to know about managing that bunch . " Manny rummaged in his pockets and brought out a cigarette . He pointed with his chin . " Seriously , what did we get ? " <p> Ray did n't answer . He kept thinking about the house , and the picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or grandmother . One of the doper kids her son or grandson . The kids now stumbling around the house , their wrists still cinched by the flex cuffs . It made him unaccountably tense , wondering how they 'd get out . They had cell phones , he knew ; he had seen them when Manny turned out their pockets . Ray thought about whoever was supplying them . Conjured a hulking gangbanger with big shoulders from the joint , a shaved head . Would there be trouble when they came up short ? He saw a big man stalking around the house with a baseball bat , Jerome and Maybe Ronald talking fast , trying to make him see how they got took by two guys said they were cops . Had guns and badges , looked like cops , sounded like cops . <p> Ray noticed one of those little roadside shrines that families build where someone has been killed in a wreck . Saw the shattered plastic flowers and rotted wooden cross , a tiny , faded photograph flashing by too fast to register . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitch in his breath that felt like panic . <p> The girl in the picture reminded him of someone . The girl in the cap and gown . The name came back to him , and the accident , and a terrible pulse in his head that made him sick . Marletta . A girl he 'd loved , who 'd loved him . The brilliant girl with the open smile . <p> He got her back for an instant sitting in the front seat of a car on the day she graduated high school . The day he would have graduated but for Juvie and the time lost . Marletta sitting beside him in her cap and gown , looking like the girl in the picture in the house on Jefferson Avenue . <p> He stretched , turned on the radio . KYW came on , the announcer talking about Allen Iverson and his bad attitude . Ray snapped off the radio , opened the window , let the rain spatter his eyes , his cheeks , his open mouth . Manny watched the road , the traffic , occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ray cranked the window back up and ran his hands over his face . He caught sight of himself in the mirror on the visor , and it looked like he 'd been crying . <p> " Ray , man ? " <p> But Ray was staring , now . His hands empty in his lap , his brain twisting in his head . " All good things , " he said . <p> Excerpted from Dope Thief by Dennis Tafoya . Copyright 2009 by Dennis Tafoya .
