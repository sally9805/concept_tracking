<p> Are the floors in your home made of wood ? Tile ? Are they covered with carpeting or vinyl ? We have plenty of options for covering our floors now , with even ancient types of floors still in use today in different parts of the world . Here 's a look at what 's been underfoot for the past 5,000 years or so . <p> Track the dirt inside <p> In many early homes , the floor was just a patch of ground . This is still true in some parts of the world , such as places in Africa where the weather is always warm . Dirt is a good , inexpensive surface . Hay , straw , and cow dung are sometimes strewn on the floor and tamped down as people walk on it , creating a surface almost as hard as cement . <p> In some regions , household waste was just thrown on the floor and trampled down . During the Middle Ages in Europe ( about AD 400 to 1400 ) , animals sometimes shared the house with peasants , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the humans ' part of the house , and their dung was also trampled into the floor . When the mineral called saltpeter ( potassium nitrate ) was first used to develop gunpowder around the 1100s , the floors of former peasant homes served as a good source for saltpeter . It is found in places where manure and refuse accumulate in the soil under dry conditions . <p> The first known use for mint in Europe was as a room deodorizer . The herb was strewn across the floors to cover the smell of the litter . Stepping on the mint helped to spread its scent through the room . <p> In early North American homes , settlers would sometimes spread sand on top of the dirt floor . When the litter in the room became unbearable , they 'd simply sweep it out the door along with the sand . Then they 'd spread a new layer of sand on the floor . Other settlers would spread peanut and sunflower seed shells on the floor . As these were trampled underfoot , the shells spread oil into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Banos area of central California , native American Yokuts dug house pits about three feet deep . They piled the dirt outside the hole for walls . Then they made domes from branches , reeds , and mud for a roof . As they walked across the dirt floors with their bare feet , the oil in their feet gradually made the dirt watertight and easy to clean . <p> Sometimes dirt floors were decorated to make them more attractive . Colored sand was used to form patterns in the dirt . In India this evolved into a well-known art form called " rangoli , " or floor painting . On a mud floor , a painting could be formed from rice powder and flower petals . These were created at the doorstep to greet visitors entering the home or to mark an important occasion . <p> Dressing up stone <p> About 5,000 years ago , Egyptians developed stone construction . Stone and brick floors began to appear . Soon these floors became works of art as well as a useful surface for the home . Colored tiles created patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . <p> As far back as 3,000 years ago , Greeks created pebble mosaics for their floors . Gradually they began using oblong stone shapes rather than pebbles . This technique was used in ancient France , Spain , Italy , and Northern Europe . <p> During the Roman Empire ( 27 BC to AD 476 ) engineers found another advantage of stone floors - heating . They built a small basement with pillars under the floor to support large stone squares . A vent was created at one end of the basement , and a fire was started under the opposite end . The heat and smoke from the fire would heat the stone floor above . <p> Evidence also shows that ceramic tiles were used for floors thousands of years ago . The Romans introduced tilemaking in portions of Western Europe . After the fall of Rome , however , the craft was forgotten for centuries . Tile floors appeared and disappeared . Decorated tiles were used in Turkey , the Middle East , and in the Netherlands during the 1600s . It was n't until the mid-1800s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern tile industry began in 1843 when Herbert Minton revived tilemaking in England . In Latin and South America , plain , undecorated ceramic tiles were common . Tiles became popular in North America during the late 1500s and flourished until about 1930 . <p> Walking on wood <p> The earliest known wood floors came into use during the Middle Ages . At first , rough planks were laid across the floor . Then these were sanded or smoothed by rubbing them with stone or metal . Later , varnishes or stains were applied to help smooth the floor and make it last longer . <p> Stains were also used to add patterns to the floors . Sometimes inlaid patterns were created by carving shapes out of different-colored woods and piecing them together to form patterns , like a puzzle . People also painted patterns and designs on the floor . <p> Now for something woolly <p> The oldest known woven rug was discovered in Siberia in the 1940s . Called the Pazyryk carpet , it dates back to about 400 BC . Other evidence suggests that some forms of rug-weaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and Asia about 4,000 years ago . <p> Carpetmaking in China dates back to the Sung Dynasty ( AD 960 to 1279 ) . Italian explorer Marco Polo saw some of these works during his travels through China and Turkey in the 1200s . He greatly admired their artistry . <p> The Romans used rugs on the floors and walls of their palaces . They even used them to pay taxes . When Egyptian Queen Cleopatra first met Roman Emperor Julius Caesar , she had herself smuggled in to him rolled up in a giant carpet . <p> Iran ( then called Persia ) greatly developed the art of rug weaving during the Safavid Dynasty ( 1502 to 1736 ) . The patterns they developed are still used in rugs around the world . " Persian rugs " are highly valued still . <p> A forgotten fad : floor cloths <p> A similar type of floor covering is the floor cloth , which has designs painted on sturdy material . These were used in fine homes in France as far back as the 1300s . In the 1600s they became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailcloth painted with an attractive design to adorn their dirt floors . The cloths became popular and were produced in factories in England and New England . Their popularity waned with the development of linoleum . <p> Early American settlers often painted tile-like patterns on their floor cloths . Thomas Jefferson had two grass-green floor cloths in his home at Monticello in Virginia , to give a natural feeling indoors . <p> Finding a floor by accident <p> Resilient floors include such pliant floor surfaces as rubber , linoleum , or vinyl . Rubber floors first appeared around 1200 and remained popular until the 1600s . <p> An English rubber manufacturer , Frederick Walton , noticed how linseed oil formed a leathery skin on top of paint . In 1863 he patented linoleum , still made by mixing linseed oil with powdered wood or cork ( or both ) , resins , pigments , ground limestone , and drying agents . <p> Rubber , cork , and asphalt tiles were developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s . Laying different colored tiles was a popular way to make geometric designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a floor surface that quickly replaced these soft tiles in popularity . <p> In the late 1800s , European researchers combined a gas called vinyl chloride in a mixture that resulted in a rigid material . No one could think of a good use for it , though . <p> In 1926 , American inventor Dr. Waldo Semon was trying to bond rubber to metal . He tried using the vinyl chloride mixture with other chemicals . His first attempts resulted in wisps of gas and an occasional explosion . Eventually he created what we now call PVC ( polyvinyl chloride ) or vinyl . It was first used in shock absorbers . Later , it was used to develop synthetic tires . Used to insulate wires during World War II , it became popular as a floor covering after the war . <p> Today , sales of resilient flooring are second only to carpet in the United States . But you are n't limited to just one choice . Many people prefer an easy-to-clean vinyl or tile in the kitchen or bathroom , and wood , rugs , or carpeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooring do you have in your home ? <p> Phrases inspired by floors <p> It 's hard to tell sometimes where or how a saying started , especially if it 's an old saying . Here are some theories about the sources of common expressions related to floors . <p> From ' besom ' to broom <p> To sweep floors during the Middle Ages , the British used a ' besom ' - a handful of twigs with the leaves attached . Besoms were often made of twigs from the ' broom scrub , ' and so the sweeping implements came to be called ' brooms ' around AD 1000 . Superstitious people put brooms across the door of a house to ward off witches . They thought that a witch had to count every straw in a broom placed across a door before entering . <p> ' Snug as a bug in a rug ' <p> Benjamin Franklin presumably invented this saying in 1772 when he used it in a letter to mean ' the utmost contentment .
