The lack of a federal policy on human embryonic-stem-cell research  --  beyond the Bush Administration 's restrictions on funding  --  has left plenty of room for the states to seize the scientific initiative . But when they did  --  starting in 2002 , when California and New Jersey became the first to extend explicit legal protection to such research  --  the result was a patchwork of laws that has paralyzed some entrepreneurs and galvanized others . <P> Some form of human embryonic-stem-cell research remains technically legal in almost every state . Only South Dakota bans it altogether , and most states simply have no relevant legislation . Seven states restrict research  --  including Michigan , which prohibits it on live embryos , making any cutting-edge work all but impossible , and Louisiana , which specifically protects embryos created by in vitro fertilization . A handful of states , including Pennsylvania and Nebraska , do not allow public funding . <P> In states where research opponents are perennially close to passing restrictive laws , uncertainty can stall science . In Missouri , conservative legislators who believe that using human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a row . Although they failed each time , the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City , Mo. , said last month it would wait on a planned $250 million expansion until state law explicitly protects embryonic-stem-cell research . " If you 're scared you 'll get shut down , " says Leonard Zon , president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research , " you think seriously about where you should be . " <P> Several states have seen others ' lack of legislation as an opportunity . The Massachusetts legislature last week backed a pro-research bill by a margin large enough to override an expected veto from Governor Mitt Romney , who promptly sent the bill back to lawmakers with four proposed amendments to weaken it . Zon says the bill , if enacted , would make Massachusetts more " stem cell friendly " than most states . California is the friendliest . Voters there approved Proposition 71 last November , backing $3 billion in state bonds to create a stem-cell-research fund , although delays in creating regulatory boards plus two lawsuits filed by research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month . <P> The rush is on to copy California . A group called Cures for Florida hopes to get a $1 billion initiative , modeled on Proposition 71 , on the statewide ballot next year . Washington Governor Christine Gregoire last week signed a bill allotting $350 million from the state 's tobacco-suit settlement to life-science research , which could include stem-cell work . But lawmakers who defeated a bill to protect stem-cell research have promised a fight over how the money is spent when it starts to flow in 2008 . New Jersey is mulling a plan to devote $380 million to a research facility and grants . In Wisconsin , where in 1998 James Thomson became the first scientist to cultivate human embryonic stem cells , Governor Jim Doyle wants $375 million for an institute . And Illinois is considering a " nip and tuck " law that would impose a 6% tax on elective medical procedures like plastic surgery to fund a stem-cell center .
