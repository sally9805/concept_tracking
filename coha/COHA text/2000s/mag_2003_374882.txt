The Bush administration 's idea of modeling a postwar Iraq on the examples of Japan and Germany after World War II COVER STORY , March 10 is naive . It took years of occupation to rebuild those countries , and Iraq is more akin to Yugoslavia than to Japan . Yugoslavia and Iraq were cobbled together from multiple states of losing empires ( Austrian and Ottoman , respectively ) after World War I. Even 20 years of U.S. occupation of Iraq , I suspect , would just delay the inevitable wars of secession and ethnic conflict there . I also suspect that future Presidents would not want to spend the money to keep U.S. troops in Iraq for the many years necessary for stabilization . DONALD PELTON Colorado Springs , Colo . <P> It defies imagination to think that after Saddam Hussein there could be a democratic Iraq that would serve as a model for other Arab countries and revolutionize the Middle East . Unfortunately , a more likely scenario is that the many factions in Iraq  --  the Kurds , Shi'ites and numerous tribal groups  --  would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. troops would be caught up in factional strife and subjected to a devastating campaign of terrorism . Are we prepared to deal with that possibility ? H. DAVID TEITELBAUM Redwood City , Calif . <P> Thanks for " Life After Saddam . " How about a follow-up on " Life After George Bush " ? With both of them gone , we would be able to look forward to a perfect world . HUBIE BENNETT Pointe Claire , Que . <P> Americans underestimate the threat of a civil war following military action in Iraq . Although Saddam is a brutal dictator who is a problem for the world , he holds together a country that may sink into anarchy and chaos after he is gone . The Kurds , Shi'ites and different Sunni Arab tribes may try to set up their own countries or may fight for control of the government , a scenario that would have an enormously negative impact on the entire Middle East . SAYYED AHMAD MAZZIDI Isfahan , Iran <P> A postwar occupation of Iraq would be devastating to the U.S. economy and to our armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq . Not only would an occupation require large amounts of money , but it would also thin out American armed forces , taking them away from fronts that seem to be developing constantly . Amid rising tensions with North Korea and the constant threat of terrorist attacks , how would the military be able to operate the way it must if thousands of troops were in Iraq ? DAN ROSEN Owings Mills , Md . <P> The enemy of our enemy is our friend . But if Iraq were defeated , the U.S. would become the enemy of warring Iraqi factions . NGUYEN TU CUNG Baldwin Park , Calif . <P> Ideals such as capitalism and democracy are not accepted everywhere . We have the ignorant belief that because they are effective for us , they would be welcome everywhere else . These ideals were never  --  and may never be  --  universal . We are naive to believe that people with completely different cultures would be quick to embrace a change in government . Why have n't we learned ?
