There is a bullet in my chest , less than a centimeter from my heart . I do n't think about it much anymore . It 's just a part of me now . But every once in a while , on a certain kind of night , I remember that bullet . I can feel the weight of it inside me . I can feel its metallic hardness . And even though that bullet has been warming inside my body for fourteen years , on a night like this when it is dark enough and the wind is blowing , that bullet feels as cold as the night itself . It was a Halloween night , which always makes me think about my days on the force . There 's nothing like being a policeman in Detroit on Halloween night . The kids wear masks , but instead of trick-or-treating they burn down houses . The next day there might be forty or fifty houses reduced to black skeletons , still smoking . Every cop is out on the streets , looking for kids with gasoline cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . The only thing worse than being a Detroit policeman on Halloween night is being a Detroit fireman . But that was a long time ago . Fourteen years since I took that bullet , fourteen years and a good three hundred miles away , due south . It might as well have been on another planet , in another lifetime . Paradise , Michigan , is a little town in the Upper Peninsula , on the shores of Lake Superior , across Whitefish Bay from Sault Ste. Marie , or " the Soo , " as the locals call it . On a Halloween night in Paradise , you might see a few paper ghosts in the trees , whipped by the wind off the lake . Or you might see a car filled with costumedchildren on their way to a party , witches and pirates looking out the back window at you as you wait at the one blinking red light in the center of town . Maybe Jackie will be standing behind the bar wearing his gorilla mask when you step into the place . The running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to scream . Aside from that , a Halloween night does n't look much different from any other October night in Paradise . It 's mostly just pine trees , and clouds , and the first hint of snow in the air . And the largest , coldest , deepest lake in the world , waiting to turn into a November monster . I pulled the truck into the Glasgow Inn parking lot . All the regulars would already be there . It was poker night . I was a good two hours late , so I was sure they had started without me . I had spent the entire evening in a trailer park over in Rosedale , knocking on doors . A local contractor had been setting a new mobile home when it tipped over and crushed the legs of one of the workers . He was n't in the hospital more than an hour before Mr. Lane Uttley , Esquire was at his side , offering the best legal services that a fifty-percent cut could buy . It would probably be a quick out of court settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always nice to have a witness just in case they try to beat the suit . Somebody to testify that no , the guy was n't stone drunk and he was n't showing off by trying to balance five tons of mobile home on his nose . I started at the scene of the accident . It was a strange sight , the mobile home still tipped over , one corner crumpled into the ground . I worked my way down the line as the sun set behind the trees . I was n't having much luck , just a few doors slammed in my face and one dog who took a nice sample of fabric out of my pant leg . I 'd been giving the private investigator thing a try for about six months . It was n't working out too well . Finally , I found one woman who would admit to seeing what happened . After she described what she had seen , she asked me if there might be a few bucks in it for her . I told her she would have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his card . " Lane Uttley , Attorney at Law , specializing in personal injury , workers ' compensation , automobile accidents , slip and fall , medical malpractice , defective products , alcohol-related accidents , criminal defense . " With his address in the Soo and his phone number . She squinted at the tiny letters , all those words on one little business card . " I ' 11 call him first thing in the morning , " she said . I did n't feel like driving all the way back to Lane 's office to drop off my report , so she 'd probably call him before he even knew who she was . Which would confuse the hell out of him , but I was cold and tired , much in need of a drink , and already late for my poker game . The Glasgow Inn is supposed to have a touch of Scotland to it . So instead of sitting on a stool and staring at your own face in the mirror behind the bar , you sit in an overstuffed chair in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland , I 'd like to move there after I retire . For now , I 'll take the Glasgow Inn . It was like a second home to me . When I walked into the place , the guys were at the table and already into the game , like I figured . Jackie , the owner of the place , was in his usual chair with his feet by the fire . He nodded at me and then at the bar . There stood Leon Prudell , one hand on the bar , the other wrapped around a shotglass . From the looks of him , it was not his first . " Well , well , " he said . " If it is n't Mr. Alex McNight . " Prudell was a big man , two-fifty at least . But he carried most of it around his middle . His hair was bright red and was always sticking out in some direction . One look at the guy , with the plaid flannel shirt and the hundred-dollar hunting boots , you knew he had lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the poker table stopped in midhand to watch us . " Mr. McNight , Private Eye , " he said . " Mr. Bigshot , himself , ay ? " With that distinctive " yooper " twang , that little rise in his voice that made him sound almost Canadian . There might have been a dozen other men in the place , besides the players at the table . The room fell silent as they all turned one by one to look at us , like we were a couple of gunslingers ready to draw . " What brings you all the way out to Paradise , Prudell ? " I asked . He looked at me for a long moment . A log on the fire gave a sudden pop like a gunshot . He drained the rest of his glass and then put it on the bar . " Why do n't we discuss this outside ? " he said . " Prudell , " I said . " It 's cold outside . I 've had a long day . " " I really think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me buy you a drink , okay ? " I said . " Can I just buy you a drink and we can talk about it here ? " " Oh sure , " he said . " You can buy me a drink . You can buy me two drinks . You can get behind the bar and mix ' em yourself . " " For God 's sake . " This I did not need . Not tonight . " That 's the least you can do for a man after you take his job away . " " Prudell , come on . " " Here , " he said . He stuffed one of his big paws into his pockets and pulled out his car keys . " You forgot to take these , too . " " Prudell ... " I did n't expect the keys to come at me so quickly , and with such deadly aim . They caught me right above the left eye before I could even flinch . All five men rose at once from their table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a seat . " I bent over to pick up the keys , feeling a trickle of blood in the corner of my eye . " Prudell , I did n't know you had such a good arm . We could have used you back when I was playing ball in Columbus . " I tossed his keys back to him . " Of course , I got to wear a mask then . " I wiped at the blood with the back of my hand . " Outside , " he said . " After you , " I said . We went out into the parking lot and stood facing each other in the cheap light . We were alone . The pine trees swayed all around us as the wind picked up . The air was heavy with moisture off the lake . He took a couple swings at me without connecting . " Prudell , are n't we a little too old for this ? " " Shut up and fight , " he said . He swung at me with everything he had . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still hurt me if I was n't careful . And unfortunately , he probably was n't quite as drunk as I hoped he was . " Prudell , you are n't even coming close , " I said . " Maybe you should stick to throwing your keys . " Get him mad , I thought . Do n't let him settle down and start finding his range . " I 've got a wife and two kids , you know . " He kept throwing big roundhouse punches with his right hand . " My wife is n't going to get her new car now . And my kids wo n't be going to Disney World like I promised them . " I ducked a right , then another right , then another . Let 's see a left , I thought . I want a nice lazy drunken left hand , Prudell . " I had a guy working for me , helping me out when I was on a job , " he said . " I swear to God , McKnight , that was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , it 's all on your head . " He tried a couple more right-hand haymakers before the idea of a left-hand jab bubbled up through all the rage and whiskey in his brain . When it came , it was as long and slow as a mudslide . I stepped into him and threw a right hook to the point of his chin , turning the punch slightly downward at the end , just like my old third base coach had taught me . Prudell went down hard and stayed down . I stood there watching him while I rubbed my right shoulder . " Get up , Prudell , " I said . " I did n't hit you that hard . " I was just about to get worried when he finally pulled himself up from the gravel . " McKnight , I will get you , " he said . " I promise you that right now . " " I 'm here most Saturday nights , " I said . " Hell , most nights period . You know where to find me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled around the parking lot for a full minute until he remembered what his car looked like . In the distance I could hear the waves dying on the rocks . I went back into the bar . The men looked at me , then at the door . They reached their own conclusions and went on with the poker hand . It was the usual crew , the kind of guys you did n't even have to say hello to , even if you had n't seen them in a week . You just sat down and looked at your cards . I held a napkin over my eye to stop the bleeding . " That clown must have stood there for two hours waiting for you , " Jackie said . " What was his beef ? " " Thinks I took his job , " I said . " He used to do some work for Uttley . " " A private investigator ? Him ? " " He likes to think so . " " I would n't pay him two cents to find his own dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his own dick ? " a man named Rudy asked . " I would n't , " Jackie said . " It 's just an expression . " " It 's not an expression , " Rudy said . " If it was an expression , I would have heard it before . " " It 's an expression , " Jackie said . " Tell him it 's an expression , Alex . " " Just deal the cards , " I said . I played some poker and had a few slow beers . Jackie went over the bridge every week to get good beer from Canada , just one more reason to love the place . I forgot all about trailer parks and pissed-off ex-private eyes for a while . I figured that was enough drama for one night . I figured I was allowed to relax a little bit and maybe even start to feel human again . But the night had other plans for me . Because that 's when Edwin Fulton had to come into the place . Excuse me , Edwin J. Fulton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had to pick this night to drop by . They had obviously just been to some sort of soiree . God knows where you 'd even find a soiree in the whole Upper Peninsula , but leave it to Edwin . He was decked out in his best gray suit , a charcoal overcoat , and a red scarf wrapped around his collar just right . The suit was obviously tailored to make him look taller , but it could only do so much . He was still a good six inches shorter than his wife . Sylvia was wearing a full-length fur coat . Fox , I would have guessed . It must have taken about twenty of them to make that coat . She had her dark hair pinned up , and when she took off her coat , we all got to see a little black number that showed off her legs and her perfect shoulders . Goddamn it , that woman had shoulders . And even on a cold night she had to go and wear something like that . She knew that every man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sick feeling that she would n't have taken her coat off at all if I had n't been there . She slipped me a quick look that hurt me more than Prudell 's keys . Edwin gave me a little wave while he ordered up a couple quick drinks . He had that look on his face , that deadpan look he always wore when he was out in public with his wife . " Tell me something , " Jackie said to nobody in particular . " How does a woman like that end up with a horse 's ass like Edwin Fulton ? " " I think it has something to do with having a lot of money , " Rudy said . " You mean if I had a million dollars she 'd be sitting over here on my lap instead ? " " I do n't know about that , " Rudy said . " Guy as ugly as you , you 'd probably need five million . " They did n't stay long . One drink and they were gone , just a quick stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave me one more glance as Edwin helped her into her coat . Whatever point she had hoped to make had apparently been made . I kept thinking about her while I played poker . It did n't help me concentrate on the cards and it did n't help my mood any , either . Outside the wind really started to pick up . We could hear it rattling the windows . " November winds are here early , " Jackie said . " It 's after midnight , " Rudy said . " It 's November first . They 're right on time . " " I stand corrected . " About an hour later , Edwin came back into the place . He was alone this time . He stood at the bar for a while , wearing his hangdog expression this time , hoping I 'd notice him . I was glad he did n't try to come over to our table . He had actually played with us once before , and had lost his money as fast as a man can lose money playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money from a guy when you know it does n't mean anything to him . That and the way he kept yammering on like he was suddenly one of the boys . He never got asked to play again . On most nights , I would have at least gone over to him for a minute to see how he was doing . I do n't know if I just felt sorry for the guy , or if I felt guilty because of the business with Sylvia . Or maybe I really liked the guy . Maybe I considered him my friend despite all the obvious reasons not to . But for some reason I just did n't feel up to it on this night . I let him stand there by the bar until he finally gave up and left . I felt bad as soon as the door shut behind him . " I 'm gon na call it a night , guys , " I said . I was hoping I could catch him in the parking lot , but when I got outside he was already gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the main road where the trees open up and you get a great look at the lake . There was n't much moonlight coming through the clouds , but there was enough to see that the waves were getting bigger , maybe four or five feet . I could feel the truck rocking in the wind as I drove . Somewhere out there , a good thousand feet under the waves , there were twenty-nine men still sleeping , twenty years after the Edmund Fitzgerald went down . I bet that night felt just like this one . The wind followed me all the way home , and even when I was inside the cabin I could feel it coming through the cracks . I turned off every light and crawled under my thickest comforter . In the total darkness I could hear the night whispering to me . I slept . I do n't know how long . Then a noise . The phone . It rang a few times before I got to it . When I picked it up , a voice said , " Alex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Edwin . " " Edwin ? God , what time is it ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " I think it 's about two in the morning . " " Two in the ... for God 's sake , Edwin , what is it ? " " Um , I 've got a little problem here , Alex . " " What kind of problem ? " " Alex , I know it 's real late , but is there any chance of you coming out here ? " " Where ? Your house ? " " No . I 'm in the Soo . " " What ? I just saw you a couple hours ago at the bar . " " Yeah , I know . I was on my way out here . " " Edwin , what the hell 's going on ? " I stood there shivering for a long moment , listening to the wind outside and to a distant hum on the phone line . " Alex , please , " he finally said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I think he 's dead . " " Who 's dead ? What are you talking about ? " " I really think he 's dead , Alex . I mean , the blood ... " " Edwin , where are you ? " " The blood , Alex . " I could barely hear him . " I 've never seen so much blood . "
