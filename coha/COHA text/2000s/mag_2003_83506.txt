No Simple Answer Allen Iverson 's Olympic dreams may be Larry Brown 's nightmare // Allen Iverson wants to represent his country at the 2004 Olympics in Athens , saying of his possible exclusion from the U.S. team , " Anyone in their right mind who has seen me play for seven years knows mat would n't be fair . " As 76ers coach , Larry Brown has had a front-row seat for six of those years ; as 2004 Olympic coach , he 'll have to decide how vigorously to lobby for the star who has battled so hard for him  --  and against him . // Iverson knows that Brown is not a voting member of the 12-person USA Basketball selection committee  --  and that Sixers G.M. Billy King is . Brown has told the committee that Iverson would be a worthy addition to the team , but he also made clear mat USA Basketball must explain to Iverson in detail the obligations involved . Players must block out 21 to 25 days this August for the regional Olympic qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots in Athens . In the summer of ' 04 players will also be tied up for five weeks , between an extended training camp , exhibition games in Europe and the Olympic tournament . And mainly for security reasons , the U.S. team will be staying in the Olympic Village , where no entourages are allowed . // NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik told the Philadelphia Daily News that Iverson did n't help his candidacy by withdrawing from the world championship team last summer , citing the death of a friend , Ra Langford , who had been fatally shot almost a year earlier . But while the committee will be concerned about Iverson 's controversial image , it will be hard to ignore his explosiveness on the court , especially coming off the bench . // So far Ray Allen , Kobe Bryant , Tim Duncan , Steve Francis , Jason Kidd , Tracy McGrady and Gary Payton have expressed interest in representing the U.S. in Athens , and Allen , Bryant and Kidd are expected to be among the first half-dozen players that the selection committee will announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots for guards , and not much playing time ; when Brown coached the Olympic qualifying team at Puerto Rico in 1999 , he started a backcourt of Kidd and Payton for all 10 games . In the end the Answer may decide that the trek is n't worth it , but if he is n't at least invited , the 76ers fear that his displeasure may make his already charged relationship with Brown more difficult . // The Nuggets ' Master Plan Lose Big Now , Spend Big Later // Has there ever been a non-expansion team with less proven talent than the Nuggets ? Five of their players are rookies , including a starting backcourt that consists of a second-round pick ( Vincent Yarbrough of Tennessee ) and an undrafted Division II point guard ( Junior Harrington of Wingate N.C. College ) . At week 's end Denver was shooting just 40.0% and scoring 80.8 points per game , putting the Nuggets on course to become the least accurate team in 40 years and the lowest-scoring one since the 24-second shot clock went into effect in 1954 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says yet another rookie , coach Jeff Bzdelik , with a wince. // So why were 17,393 fans at the Pepsi Center last Saturday cheering throughout an 87-76 loss to the vastly superior Kings ? Maybe it was because , as Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said of the Nuggets afterward , " they just keep coming at you , and they never quit . " Or maybe it was that after years of putting up with underachieving teams and griping millionaires , the fans have been smitten by players who are humble and hungry . The loss left Denver at 7-25 ( a game ahead of the Cavaliers in the LeBron James lottery race ) , but 12 of the Nuggets ' losses have been by single digits , and their victories have included shockers against the Pacers , Spurs , Suns and Trail Blazers . // When Kiki Vandeweghe replaced Dan Issel as general manager before the 2001-02 season , Denver was a perennial loser with the league 's seventh-highest payroll . Vandeweghe spent his first year unloading such high-priced talent as Nick Van Exel , Raef Lafrentz and Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks Nikoloz Tskitishvili ( 19 years old ) , Nene Hilario ( 20 ) and Rodney White ( 22 ) . All are promising but raw ; only Hilario  --  an active 6 ' 11 " , 260-pounder from Brazil  --  has been a consistent contributor . Vandeweghe then made a coach out of Bzdelik , the team 's Eastern scout " I told Jeff I want two things , " says Vandeweghe . ' Teach the young players to work hard and play fundamentally sound , aggressive , man-to-man defense . " // Following that mandate , the 49-year-old Bzdelik ( buzz-DEL-ik ) is helping the franchise establish an identity . Through Sunday , Denver was forcing an NBA-best 18.3 turnovers and holding opponents to 89.0 points per game ( fifth lowest in the league ) . The results are more impressive if you consider that center Marcus Camby , point guard Chris Whitney and forward Chris Andersen  --  three of Bzdelik 's top seven players  --  have missed a combined 60 games because of injuries and that Vandeweghe unloaded No. 2 scorer James Posey to the Rockets in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The Nuggets ' unlikely mainstay has been veteran forward Juwan Howard , who is providing leadership for the present while representing hope for the future . In May his seven-year , $105 million contract will expire , clearing $20.6 million in salary-cap room and giving Denver the chance to sign two free agents to maximum contracts next summer . " We can say to players , Who would you like to play with ? " says Vandeweghe , implying  --  without mentioning names  --  that the Nuggets could go after free agents Tim Duncan and Jason Kidd , much as Orlando did three seasons ago when it signed Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady. // That 's a long shot , especially since Denver will face competition from San Antonio , which could retain Duncan and offer Kidd the max . But if the Nuggets win the lottery and the right to draft James , then perceptions might change in a hurry . ( Another , less ambitious , plan for Denver would be to try to sign two free agents from a pool of Clippers : forward Elton Brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // While rival G.M. 's remain skeptical that Vandeweghe will be able to recruit winners like Duncan and Kidd , there is no denying that the Nuggets ' only hope was to start from scratch . It 's a high-risk course , as the Magic  --  its own rebuilding plans damaged by Hill 's ankle injuries  --  will attest . Still , with seven first-round picks over the next four years , the signs in Denver are more promising than the team 's current record suggests .
