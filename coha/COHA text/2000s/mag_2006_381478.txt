The least known but one of the most eagerly courted , screening committees for the next G.O.P. presidential nominee met recently in Colorado Springs , Colo. , amid the panoramic opulence of the Broadmoor Hotel and Resort . The four-day meeting of affluent Evangelicals was billed as a " summer family retreat , " and the kids rode ponies and played water sports while their folks chewed over immigration and gay marriage . The political group , called Legacy , aims for mystique : it has received no media attention and is unknown even on the Web . Yet all the marquee ' 08 Republican candidates have spoken to Legacy or met with its founders , having come to regard the group as a prime audience in these early days of raising money and trying to conjure momentum . " If you 're running for President , " said a close associate of President George W. Bush 's , " it is the place to go . " One of the group 's first projects : supplying cash and ground troops to help South Dakota 's John Thune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a presidential prospect , electrified the Broadmoor audience , which also heard from Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn of Texas . <P> Legacy was started by two Dallas businessmen : Ray Washburne , a real estate and Tex-Mex-restaurant baron , and George Seay III , founder of the Seay Stewardship &; Investment Co. and grandson of former Texas Governor Bill Clements . Its members are mostly young  --  in their 30s and 40s  --  and wealthy , through entrepreneurship , inheritance or both . They are Christians concerned with social justice , in the mold of Rick Warren of Purpose Driven Life fame , and practice their faith without , as a Broadmoor attendee put it , " quoting Leviticus "  --  a reference to the harder-edged rhetoric at other gatherings of social conservatives . <P> Organizers declined to be interviewed , saying they want to continue working below the radar . Cornyn tells TIME that the founders " have been beneficiaries of the political activity of their parents , and want to step up now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , fills " a vacuum between national organizations and political activists who are grandparents . " <P> Speakers at the retreat in late July , which drew 165 families , included Matt Daniels of the Alliance for Marriage , and an immigration panel featured tax-cut leader Grover Norquist and Hugh Hewitt , a conservative radio host and blogger . Reflecting Legacy 's aim for social impact , Gary Haugen of International Justice Mission talked about heading the U.N . genocide investigation in Rwanda . Audience members rose to describe a trip they had taken there . The weekend ended in the Cheyenne Lodge with a family worship service led by Mark Brewer of California 's Bel Air Presbyterian Church . He was Ronald Reagan 's last pastor , now ministering to a group hungry to amplify Reagan 's spirit .
