When he visits the West Los Angeles neighborhood where he grew up , Charles Levan feels sadness and disdain . One by one , the charming two- and three-bedroom houses that decorated the streets of his childhood are being bulldozed and replaced with bloated mansions on tiny lots . " Half the houses on our block have been leveled , " says Levan , 34 . " The thought of that happening to my house tugs at my heartstrings . " <P> Join the club , Charles . Folks with no visible trace of their roots are fast multiplying . Teardowns , once the province of the exceptionally rich and developers rehabbing crumbling neighborhoods , have gone mainstream . Today well-kept homes are being knocked down by the thousands so that builders can get at the valuable ground beneath . " There 's a certain sadness about what 's happening to those great little cottages , " Brit Fennell , a Coldwell Banker broker , says of Levan 's old neighborhood , known as Brentwood Flats . " But the mansionization trend is consumer demand at work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs of Chicago and Boston , any block with smallish homes near desirable workplaces , good schools and popular stores and entertainment is red meat for carnivorous builders . The National Trust for Historic Preservation in a 2002 report documented more than 200 historically significant communities in 20 states where teardowns were prevalent . In the Chicago suburb of Hinsdale , the report said , an astonishing 1,200 homes ( 20% of the supply ) had been demolished since 1986 . The trend has intensified since then . Nationally , as many as 75,000 of the single-family houses built last year were put up on parcels where a house had been razed , builders estimate . <P> Brentwood Flats is a microcosm . In one case , a buyer paid $745,000 for a humble 70-year-old , three-bedroom house in 2003 . It was promptly ripped down , and 18 months later the two-story , five-bedroom Italian villa erected in its place sold for $2.7 million . Around the corner , one lot has changed hands three times in four years . Its original two-bedroom Southern Colonial went for $567,000 in 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 million last August . <P> Some who live in future teardowns are caught in a financial catch-22 . Real estate agents all but guarantee Corey Glave a six-figure profit if he sells his two-bedroom Hermosa Beach bungalow outside L.A. But where would he and his family go ? Soaring prices across the region have put anything suitable out of reach . " To get the same yard and ocean view that I have now would cost way over $1 million , " he says . <P> So , for now , the Glaves are sitting on their equity , staring daily at the towering new edifices around them that they consider eyesores . But they must know that it 's just a matter of time before they take the money and run . When that day comes , they 'll be sure to soak up a final view  --  and on their way out , sidestep the bulldozer in their driveway .  --  By Sonja Steptoe/ Los Angeles
