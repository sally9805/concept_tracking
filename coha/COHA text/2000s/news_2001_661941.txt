<p> What sort of religious regime would demand the demolition of grand artworks that have stood for 15 centuries ? Or eliminate schooling for girls after age 8 ? Or chop off the hands or feet of thieves at stadium rallies ? <p> According to the zealous Taliban who have ruled most of Afghanistan since 1996 , faithfulness to Islam requires such unprecedented harshness , enforced by police from the omnipresent Ministry of Virtue and Vice . <p> But Muslim moderates and scholars in other lands say the Taliban are wrong . <p> Afghanistan 's destruction of two monumental Buddha statues in recent days has provoked near-universal outrage , from Muslim leaders as well as art lovers . Egypt 's highest Muslim authority , Grand Mufti Nasr Farid Wasel , joined prominent Qatar scholar Sheik Youssef al-Qaradawi and others in an emergency mission to urge the regime to reconsider . <p> The Taliban leaders were not swayed : Islam 's stand against idolatry , they said , demands elimination of these and other open-air statues and thousands of art treasures held in Afghan museums , which now reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine the image of Islam and even to make some Muslims skeptical whether their faith can face the challenges of modernism , " former Egyptian diplomat Hussein Ahmed Amin wrote this week . <p> An Afghan scholar in the United States , Amin Tarzi , charges that his homeland 's rulers feed off the peoples ' " illiteracy and lack of knowledge of traditional Islamic teachings . " <p> The Taliban employ religion as well as Pashtun tribal traditions " to legitimize their rule based on a terror system , " says Tarzi , of the Monterey ( Calif . ) Institute of International Studies . The Pashtun are Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group . <p> Others are simply baffled . <p> " I personally do n't have any idea where they get some of their ideas , " says Professor Anis Ahmed of Pakistan 's Islamic University . <p> Some tenets come from literal interpretation of the Quran , the Muslim scripture , Ahmed explains , but " if you take things literally that will lead to extremism . " He says the Quran must be read in light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sayings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad . <p> The Muslim world has largely spurned the Taliban . The Organization of the Islamic Conference refuses to admit the regime and only three of the 56 member nations ( Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates ) grant it recognition . <p> Even neighboring Iran , whose 1979 revolution energized militant Islamists worldwide , spurns the Taliban , although that hostility stems from alleged Taliban persecution of fellow Shiite Muslims . Islam 's larger Sunni branch dominates in Afghanistan . <p> The Taliban emerged in 1994 , promising peace and rebelling against warring Islamic factions that had ravaged the country and killed 50,000 people . <p> They are led by the reclusive Mullah Mohammed Omar , the self-declared " king of the Muslims , " and a circle of eight to 10 colleagues from Kandahar in the deeply tribal southeast , near the Pakistan border . <p> Omar says in a movement magazine that " the Taliban was a simple band of dedicated youths ... determined to establish the laws of God on earth , and prepared to sacrifice everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " students , " and many followers attended conservative Muslim schools in Pakistan as refugees during the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . Many studied at Dar-ul Uloom Haqqani in Akora Khattak , one of Pakistan 's largest Muslim campuses . <p> The Taliban follow the severe Deobandi school , named for Deoband , an Indian town where 1,000 students from many nations train to teach and lead mosques at the influential , 140-year-old Dar-ul Uloom . <p> This is the academic source for the Taliban gender policies . " It is biologically , religiously and prophetically proven that men are superior to women , " says Maulana Adil Siddiqu , a seminary spokesman . " Women can be educated and improved , but not to the extent of a man . " <p> The Taliban sometimes depict the limit on girls ' schooling as temporary . Their prohibition of women working outside the home is part of strict segregation of the sexes to prevent sexual impropriety . Similarly , women are only allowed outside the home if accompanied by a close male relative . <p> The government relented on employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year temporarily shut down foreign-run charity bakeries that employ destitute widows . <p> On education , Tarzi notes that the Quran ( 7:189 ; 16:97 ; 33:35 ) mandates religious equality and training for men and women alike . He says the scriptural dictum that women should " stay quietly in your houses " and appear only before male relatives ( 33:32-3,53-5 ) applied only to the Prophet Muhammad 's wives . <p> " I have not found anywhere in Islamic teachings where women can not go out , and education is obligatory , " agrees Ahmed . <p> As for the Buddha-smashing , Islam abhors worship of idols and , consequently , pious artists do not depict the human form . Muhammad cleared Mecca of idols when he inaugurated the religion . But Muslims did not believe that required elimination of pre-Islamic statuary when they conquered Egypt and Iran soon after Muhammad 's lifetime . <p> Qatar 's Al-Qaradawi issued a fatwa , or religious ruling , this month that the Afghan statues are not active idols and thus do not threaten belief or contradict doctrine . <p> The Taliban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahmood Ghaznavi rampaged across northern India smashing many Hindu idols . But Tarzi says the sultan probably used religion as a cover for acquiring the gems and precious metals the figures were encrusted with . <p> There 's long been debate over Islamic punishments . <p> The Quran 's prescribed penalty for theft is cutting off the hands ( 5:38 ) , but Ahmed says this applies only in extreme situations and others cite the very next verse , which teaches God 's forgiveness of those who repent . Most Muslim nations today do not mutilate thieves . <p> On dress , the Taliban require all Afghan women to be shrouded in a burqa from head to toe . But many Muslims follow looser understandings of modesty . The Quran ( 24:31 ) merely tells women to " draw their veils over their bosoms . " <p> Similarly , Afghan men must cover their heads and can not wear shorts or short-sleeved shirts . <p> In January , Omar decreed that anyone who converts from Islam to another religion , or who seeks such conversions , will be killed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Muslim who " utters unbelief , " and some other Muslim nations have similar laws , but actual executions are rare . <p> Other Taliban rules follow fundamentalist Islamic or Pashtun traditions that most believers do not see as faith requirements . Among them : <p> The only allowable music is religious song , unaccompanied by instruments . ( However , police have not interfered with music played privately in worship by the Hindu and Sikh minorities . ) <p> Television , movies and videos are banned . So is kite-flying , seen as a frivolous distraction from a life of prayer . <p> Public bath houses have been shut down , even though the masses lack running water . <p> Material published outside Afghanistan is forbidden , and bookstore owners selling material about other religions or critizing Islam face five years in prison . <p> Men can not clip their beards or shave ( punishable by public beating ) or wear long hair over the forehead . <p> Men 's attendance at mosque is enforced by rifle-toting soldiers . <p> Taxi drivers are publicly beaten if they carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first-floor windows of their homes black so men can not peer inside . <p> Paper bags are illegal for fear recycled paper would include discarded copies of the Quran . <p> Overall , says Tarzi , the Taliban are in the process of creating a variant that Islam has never before seen , extending far beyond the puritanical Islamic reform that the 19th century Wahhabi movement imposed in Saudi Arabia . <p> " This is absolutely new , " he says . " No other Islamic country comes close . " <p> The phenomenon could spread . Taliban-inspired rules are already being imposed in neighboring rural areas within Pakistan . And Afghanistan is a haven for hundreds of activists who are believed to be preparing to overthrow the more moderate Muslim governments in Algeria , Egypt , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Yemen and the Islamic states of the former Soviet Union . <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE - Kathy Gannon , AP 's Islamabad bureau chief , recently returned from Afghanistan .
