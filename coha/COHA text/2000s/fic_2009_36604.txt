Andy <p> I sat on Miss Sara 's couch and killed all the Mega Warriors . I could usually kill them better , but her TV was way littler than ours and I was sick . That 's why I was in Miss Sara 's trailer . Only I was n't supposed to call it a trailer . " It 's a mobile home , " Mom reminded me when she brought me here this morning . Even though she sometimes called it a trailer , too . <p> Things were different since the fire . Mom said I should call Sara " Miss Sara " like I did when I was little . It 's politer . Miss Sara used to hug me and be real nice and Mom 's best friend . Since the fire , Mom and her hardly even talk . The only reason I was in the mobile home was because Mom was desperate . That 's what she said to Uncle Marcus this morning . <p> I was still in bed , tired from getting sick from both ends all night long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . I heard Mom say , " I 've tried everybody . I 'm desperate . I 'll have to ask Sara . " Uncle Marcus said he could stay home with me and Mom said , " No ! Please , Marcus . I need you with me . " <p> " I can stay alone , " I called , but it came out quiet on account of being sick . I was sixteen ; I did n't need a babysitter . I was sure I was done barfing , too . I could n't be sick anymore because Maggie was coming home today . I wanted to jump up and down and yell " Maggie 's coming home ! " but I was too tired . I could only jump up and down in my imagination . <p> I heard Mom on the phone with Miss Sara . " Please , Sara . I 'm sure it 's just a twenty-four-hour bug . I know it 's a huge favor to ask , but I ca n't leave him alone . It 'll only be for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " Can you watch Andy today ? " and Miss Sara would say , " Sure ! No problem ! " But this was n't those days anymore . <p> After a minute , Mom said , " Thank you ! Oh , thank you so much ! We 'll drop him at your house about ten-thirty . " <p> I pulled the blanket over my head . I did n't want to get up and get dressed and go to Miss Sara 's trailer . I just wanted to go back to sleep till Maggie got home . <p> I brought my own pillow with me to the trailer . In the car , I leaned against the window with my head on it . Mom kept turning around from her seat . " Are you okay , Andy ? " <p> " Mmm , " I said . That meant yes , but I was too tired to open my mouth . I knew she wanted to reach back and touch my forehead . She was a nurse and she could tell if you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . <p> " Just think , Andy , " Uncle Marcus said . " When we pick you up at Sara Miss Sara 's this afternoon , Maggie will be with us . " <p> Free , I thought . Maggie would finally be free . I hated visiting her at that stupid prison . <p> At the trailer , I laid down on Miss Sara 's couch with my pillow . Miss Sara got a blanket and Mom covered me over . She got to put her hand on my forehead then . She gave Miss Sara ginger ale and crackers for me . I started falling asleep as Mom said , " I ca n't thank you enough , Sara , " and things like that . <p> Then she left and I fell asleep for a long time . I woke up and Miss Sara was walking across the living room . She looked right at me . She was carrying a big box with a picture of a pot on it . She stopped walking and put it on the floor . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lines on her forehead and by her eyes . So did Mom , but not as many . <p> " ' Kay , " I said . My mouth tasted icky . <p> " You ready for some ginger ale and crackers ? Think you can keep them down ? " <p> I nodded . Except for feeling tired and kind of shaky , I was fine . I could 've stayed home alone , no problem . <p> I sat up and Miss Sara brought me ginger ale in a glass with ice and crackers on a plate . Her eyes looked like she 'd been crying . They were red how your eyes got . She smiled a funny smile at me . I smiled one back at her . People sometimes cried when they were happy and I knew that 's what was going on . Mom had red eyes all week . Miss Sara was probably as happy about Maggie coming home as we all were . <p> I drank some ginger ale , which tasted good . Miss Sara carried the box outside . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to play some of Keith 's video games ? " Which is how I started playing Mega Warrior . <p> Now I shot another Mega Warrior and then a Super Mega Warrior , which are the ones with the arrow things on their heads . At least it was a school day and Keith was n't home . Keith was one of the people I could n't save at the fire . Mom said he could actually die at first , but he did n't . He got scars , though . His hands and his arms look like they have maps on them , only without the country names . One of his hands is scrunched up , kind of . Part of his face has that map look on it , too . He got held back and now we 're both juniors . He hated me even before I could n't save him . I felt sorry for him , though , because of his scars . <p> The phone rang in the kitchen . I could see Miss Sara pick it up . She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-thirty , Laurel ! " she said . Laurel was my mom . <p> One of the regular warriors killed my littlest man . That happened when you forgot to concentrate , like I was doing because I wanted to know what Mom was saying . <p> " All right , " Miss Sara said . She hung up the phone without saying goodbye , which was rude . <p> I was n't doing so good at Mega Warriors now , but I had good determination and kept trying . <p> Miss Sara came in the room again . " Your mom said she wo n't be back till around four-thirty , " she said . <p> " Okay . " I killed two Super Mega Warriors in a row . Bang ! Bang ! Then one killed me . <p> " Andy ? Look at me . " <p> I looked at her face even though I did n't stop pushing the controller buttons . <p> " I need to run to the store , " she said . " Keith 'll be home soon . When he arrives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " <p> She put one of those long white envelopes on the coffee table . It said Keith on it . <p> " Okay . " <p> She was in my way . I had to move my head to see the TV . <p> " Andy ! " Miss Sara said . " Look at me ! " <p> I stopped pushing the buttons . She was using an I-mean-business voice . <p> " Did you hear me ? " she asked . " What did I just say ? " <p> " Mom wo n't be here until later . " I could n't remember the time she said . <p> " And what else ? " Miss Sara used to be so nice . She 'd turned into another lady this year . <p> " You 're going to the store . " <p> " And this , Andy . " She picked up the envelope and kind of shook it in front of my face . " What did I say about this ? " <p> " Give the mail to Keith , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'll give it to him . " <p> She looked at her watch . " Oh , never mind . I 'll put it where he 'll see it . " <p> " Okay , " I said . <p> She walked in the kitchen , then came back again . " All right , " she said . " I 'm going now . " <p> " Goodbye . " I wished she would just go . <p> I started playing again when she left . Then I got thirsty and my glass was empty . I walked into the kitchen to get more ginger ale . I saw the mail that said Keith on it on the table . She said it was important . What if Keith did n't see it there ? <p> I took the envelope back in the living room and stuck it in my book bag so I could n't forget to give it to him . Then I sat down again to kill some more warriors . <p> Maggie <p> They moved me from my cell hours later than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighten out . I was afraid they were n't going to let me go . There 'd been some mistake , I thought . A prison official would show up at my cell door and say , Oh , we thought you were in prison for twelve months , but we read the order wrong . It 's really twelve years . It 's amazing the things you can imagine when you 're alone in a cell . <p> I sat on my skinny bed with my hands folded in my lap and my heart pounding , waiting . An hour . Two hours . I could n't budge . Could n't open the book I was reading . Just sat there waiting for them to come tell me how twelve months was a mistake and I could n't get out today . I deserved the twelve years . Everyone knew that , including me . <p> But finally , Letitia , my favorite guard , came to get me . I let out my breath like I 'd been holding it in for those two hours and started to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was nothing more than a dark , wavy blur . <p> She shook her head at me , and I knew she was wearing that half sneer it took me a few months to recognize as a kind of affection . <p> " You crying ? " she asked . " Girl , you cried the day you come in here and now you crying the day you leave . Make up your mind . " <p> I tried laughing but it came out more like a whimper . <p> " Let 's go , " she said , unlocking the door , sliding the bars to the left , and I thought , that 's the last time I 'll ever have to hear that door scrape open . I walked next to Letitia as we started down the broad central hall between the rows of cells , side by side like equals . Two free women . Free . I needed a tissue , but did n't have one . I wiped my nose with the back of my hand . <p> " You 'll be back ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell . Others hooted and hollered . Cussed and shouted . " Yo , bitch ! Gon na burn some more kiddies , huh ? " BB they called me . Baby Burner , even though the people who died in the fire were two teenagers and an adult . I did n't fit in . It was n't just that I was white . There were plenty of white women in the prison . It was n't that I was young . Sixteen was the age at which you were tried as an adult in North Carolina , so there were plenty younger than me . It was , as Letitia told me the first week I got there , that " they can smell the money on you , girl . " I did n't see how . I did n't look any different from them , but I guessed everybody knew my story . How I 'd laid a fire around a church to let my firefighter boyfriend shine in the department . How I did n't set the fire when I realized kids would be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing the match on the fuel I 'd poured without realizing it was there . How people died and burned and had their lives totally screwed up . They all knew the details , and even though some of them had murdered people , maybe sticking a knife in their best friend 's heart , or they sold drugs to junior-high kids or robbed a store or whatever , they stuck together and I was the outcast . <p> At the beginning of the year I 'd thought about Martha Stewart a lot , how even though she was a rich white woman , she made all these friends in prison and they loved her . Adored her , even . How she came out on top . I told myself maybe that 's how it could be with me . <p> As Letitia and I went down the wide corridor between the cells , I remembered the first time I 'd made that long walk . The hooting and name-calling . I did n't think of the women as people then . They seemed like wild dogs and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Now I knew better . They could n't get out . I learned it was n't when they were in their cells that they could hurt me , but out in the yard . I was beaten up twice , and for someone like me who 'd never even been hit , it was terrible . Both times , it was a girl named Lizard . She was six feet tall with thin , straggly , almost colorless hair . She was skinny and her body seemed out of proportion to the long arms and legs she could wrap around you like strands of wire . She let me have it , for no reason I could think of except that she hated me , like so many of the others hated me . I was n't good at getting beaten up . I did n't fight back well . I cowered , covering my face with my hands , while she pounded my ribs and tore handfuls of my dark hair out by the roots . I had one thought running through my mind : I deserve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TV all the time . There 'll be cuts and some blood , but you do n't get to feel the fear while it 's happening . The **29;285;TOOLONG kind of fear . Or the pain that goes on for days . Letitia saved me both times . Then I was " Letitia 's pretty baby . " LPB . They had initials for everything . A lot of the initials I never did figure out because I was n't part of the in crowd . I was n't the only outsider , though . Not the only one getting picked on . I was n't the weakest by far . They 'd find the ones who were least able to defend themselves and move in for the kill . All I could think was , thank God Andy was n't the one to land in prison . He would never have survived . <p> I got over the whole Martha Stewart fantasy real fast . After the first couple of days , I did n't even try to make friends . I kept to myself , reading , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNC Wilmington this year . Maybe a business major , which seemed totally ridiculous to me now . Business ? What did that matter , really ? Who could I help with a degree in business ? What good could I do for anybody but myself and maybe some bloodsucking company ? I tried to keep a journal , but I threw it away after a couple of months because I could n't stand rereading what I 'd written in the first few days about Ben and how I still loved him even though he betrayed me . How I did something so stupid out of love for him . How I killed people . I took lives . I wrote those words over and over on four or five pages of the journal like some third-grade punishment . I 'd touch the latest cut on my lip from Lizard or the bruises that crisscrossed my legs and think these are nothing . <br> Continues ...
